            "content": "Okay, I'm a Nic Cage fanboy. Let's get that out of the way. I'll watch anything the guy does no matter how terrible the reviews are, and sometimes I'll be pleasantly surprised, as was the case with \"Seeking Justice\", \"Drive Angry\", and \"Kiss of Death\". The guy has some hidden gems in his career. Is Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance one of them? Hell no.The first Ghost Rider was campy and stupid, but it was a watchable popcorn action movie and it had Eva Mendes (hence, watchable). Spirit of Vengeance is just stupid. Everything about it is stupid. No part of this movie is fleshed out and none of it is interesting. It throws you right into the action with no exposition. It's just a bunch of things happening on screen oozing with CGI to make up for the complete lack of substance. You can tell this is the same guy that directed Crank: the difference is that movie didn't need any substance because the premise was so fun. This movie just pisses on Ghost Rider's origin (literally) and expects you to enjoy watching sh*t blow up for the sake of sh*t blowing up. The writing in this movie is especially horrendous; did they hire a 10 year old to do the screenplay? It sure as hell seems like it.So you may be asking yourself, \"why give it a 4/10 if it's so awful?\" Well, I'm a sucker for laughably bad movies and this definitely qualifies. I mean, the dialogue alone tries to take itself seriously but ends up providing really good unintentional laughs. But I'll be fair, not all of this movie sucks.Nicolas Cage is always enjoyable to watch. You can tell he's invested in the role, and his dedication really holds this movie together. Idris Elba is also in this movie for some reason and he's great in anything, even if his character is completely throwaway. The other acting is serviceable I guess. You can't really blame any actors here because it's obvious the filmmakers wanted it to be a massive CGI-fest with stupid dialogue to lead action sequence A to action sequence B. To their credit, the CGI in this movie is pretty cool. Ghost Rider looks badass, the visuals in the big set pieces are nice to look at, and if you have no interest in the story you can definitely shut your brain off and enjoy the insanity happening on screen. So in a nutshell, you don't need to see this movie. You really don't. Not even the great Nicolas Cage is enough to hold this piece of trash together. But if you're really stoned or just want to see cool sh*t on screen for an hour and a half and there's literally nothing else to watch, go ahead and knock yourself out with Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance. You may find a new B-movie comedy classic.",

            "content": "The first Ghost Rider film from 2007 was fairly faithful to the comic. When Ghost Rider came out in 1972 it was more of a general idea than a fully fleshed-out premise. This was clear as the stories changed from writer to writer and one artist to another. Ideas were added as the years progressed, like the \"penance stare\" and Blaze's growing awareness of the former angel of justice, Zarathos. The book was canceled in 1983 after a ten-year run. In 1990 a new version of Ghost Rider was introduced with a different character and it ran eight years.The first film was an amalgam of the ideas presented in these two series, mostly the first, and struck me as the comic-book come to life. Really, the only thing that was disappointing was the villain, Blackheart, who was seriously scary in the comics, but not so much in the movie.\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" (2012) is a worthy follow-up with Nicolas Cage returning as Johnny Blaze. The story switches to Europe and, more specifically, Romania and Turkey, where the film was shot.This time the devil is played by Ciar\u00e1n Hinds, rather than Peter Fonda, which isn't a big deal considering Satan could presumably take different physical forms. The devil's main minion is played by Johnny Whitworth, a different character than Blackheart from the original, albeit similar. The hot female is Violante Placido, who's arguably an improvement over Eva Mendes. Another positive is the rockin' soundtrack.I don't mind the story switching to eastern Europe since the locations are excellent, particularly the amazing cave-monastery, but there are other changes that I'm not so crazy about, like the charred biker jacket of the Ghost Rider, but this is just a matter of taste; I simply prefer the cool biker \"costume\" as opposed to the dirtbag biker look. A more significant negative is the overactive camera that's annoying and draws attention to itself (hopefully this fad has run its course). But there are enough dramatic parts to balance out the quick-edited thrills; besides, you get used to itBOTTOM LINE: \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" is a quality sequel that interestingly fleshes out the nature of the spirit that possesses Johnny blaze (I'd say more, but I don't want to spoil it). People who claim the film's more \"serious\" and \"faithful\" to the comic are off the mark. It has the same quasi-serious, cartoony-horror vibe as the first film, with glimpses of humor. As radical as the first movie was (in a comic booky way), this one ups the ante and is the better for it. Unfortunately it's marred by the hyperactive camera and quick editing.The film runs 1 hour, 35 minutes.GRADE: B.",

            "content": "I don't know what to make of Ghost Rider: The Spirit of Vengeance. I know it's laughably bad, but I couldn't help being entertained. The first film was actually a decent, enjoyable film, but the sequel is more campy and has a different tone. The story is very dumb, compared to the first film. But the visuals are excellent. I loved the look of the Ghost Rider and his charred skull.Neveldine and Taylor's film brings about the return of the Ghost Rider. Johnny Blaze has been hiding out in the remote parts of Europe, but he returns when the Church recruits his help to help protect a boy, whom has the Devil after him so he can use the boy's body.Nic Cage delivers another over-the-top performance as Johnny Blaze and despite some amusing moments, it did get old and stale after awhile. Idris Elba does a good job as the Church guy and Ciarin Hinds is decent as the Devil.Overall, this is a over-the-top superhero film that doesn't deserve widespread hate, but still is pretty bad. But what I mean by bad is the film is \"good\" bad. I found it somewhat entertaining and a nice way to spend an hour and a half. The story/script is just plain silly, but the visuals are very good. I rate this film 7/10.",

            "content": "I believe that I am in the minority for enjoying the original Ghost Rider, and I was looking forward to this sequel despite its current low IMDb rating of 4.3. As it turns out, I should have listened to the masses: Spirit of Vengeance is virtually unwatchable, even for a Nic Cage fan like myself.The first clue to the low quality of this film is its locale: as a rule, I find sequels that inexplicably take place in Eastern Europe to be inferior to the original, the seemingly exotic setting often chosen for no other reason than pure economics, productions costing less to film in places like Turkey and Romania. The other big clue that I would probably hate this film was the directorial team of Brian Taylor and Mark Neveldine, who were responsible for the ADHD Jason Statham action flick Crank, a film that annoyed me from start to finish.To make matters even worse, the plot is derivative, reminding me an awful lot of the far superior sci-fi classic Terminator 2: Judgment Day (a boy and his tough mother are protected by a once-bad, leather jacket wearing, partly human protector who rides a motorbike), the script is terrible (even Cage's wild eyed mad acting technique cannot detract from the awful dialogue), and there are some truly lousy performances from the supporting cast (worst offenders: Fergus Riordan as irritating kid Danny and Christopher Lambert as facially tattooed monk Methodius)\u2014 all of which had me struggling to stay awake.I will definitely not be getting my hopes up if a third Ghost Rider movie should ever get the green-light.",

            "review_title": "Nicolas Rage",
            "content": "The biggest problem of the first Ghost Rider movie is it doesn't have enough riding, no action, and it focuses more to the romance between Johnny Blaze and Roxanne. Which isn't really the main appeal. In this film, it gets focused to the plot. Unfortunately, the story is weak and the script has its awkwardness scattered. Thankfully, there's Nicolas Cage who's spicing things up with his crazy insane performance. This is probably one of his craziest performance since Bad Lieutenant. Also, there's the Crank directors, Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, using their shaky camera and directing style. It fits to the film. Some people may be disappointed but if you're in for some crazy Nicolas Cage and some crazy action then you're going to enjoy this.It doesn't look like a sequel though. The flashback of Johnny Blaze's deal is different from the first movie. The only thing that stays here is Nicolas Cage. Everything else is new. Well, the story is pretty weak. The plot is little. The whole film is just chasing and protecting a boy. But chasing is what's best in a Ghost Rider film. More riding and less brooding. Though, there are some brooding but mostly is riding. But stories are still important in films and that is the main flaw of this. The script is awkward. With awkward dialogue and awkward moments.The best parts goes to Nicolas Cage. This may not be the same performance from the first film but this new Blaze is more entertaining and ridiculously hilarious. With more ridiculous is the directing. Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor uses a lot of their trademarks and gives plenty of insanity in some scenes. There's a perfect chemistry between their directing and Nicolas Cage's rage. Feels like it's one of the trippiest films I have ever seen. The action is quite ridiculous. With its well shot shaky camera and its non-stop booming. These things feels right for this film. Yes, flaming awesome and disintegrating bad guys. Do the most ridiculous things with the power.Aside from Cage, Idris Elba and John Whitworth are both fun and awesome. Ciar\u00e1n Hinds is like Danny Houston. Even in the single glance, you know he could be a dangerous bad guy. And here, he is a threatening one. The CGI is obvious. The new skull design of Ghost Rider looks more awesome than the first one. The camera is shaky but it's well shot and made the action more exciting even in 2D.Some people might get disappointed if they expect something bigger. But the action is bigger but the plot is just little. The people who likes Nicolas Cage and Neveldine/Taylor will enjoy this a lot. Or someone who wants to see something ridiculously insane. It's hard to take this film so seriously. It's just hilarious and fun. Let me say that it's a crazy version of last year's Priest but with better action scenes and there's a nut main hero than a bland one. It's short, it's dumb, but has its enjoyment. There's an easy advice to watch this film: Watch it for Nicolas Cage.",

            "content": "Spirit Of Vengeance ignites onto the screen in a mass of blazing carnage and sizzling hot 3D visual effects. Packed with some of the most random and craziest images you'll ever see, Ghost Rider 2 will mess with your head. It's great to see Nicolas Cage go mental in his roles, he actually goes insane and you can tell that by the look in his eyes. This time Johnny Blaze is on a mission to save a boy from the devil. The story is basic and needs some more development but the 3D and action totally make up where the story doesn't. The Ghost Rider takes control of several vehicles and tears up location after location, one scene includes a giant quarry digger that sets aflame and starts crushing bad guys and blowing stuff up taking down multiple enemies, and he also takes on a whole motorway full of the Devil's right hand men which ends up in more destruction. Spirit Of Vengeance shows what 3D can do at it's best alongside the wild camera-work from Neveldine and Taylor. Glass shatters, flames and cinders float out the screen in extreme force. It's miles better than the first, Spirit Of Vengeance works due to the choppy camera-work, fiery visuals, Nic Cage and some wild 3D.",

            "content": "'GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE': Three Stars (Out of Five) Nicolas Cage returns to play Johnny Blaze, also known as 'Ghost Rider', the superhero antihero from Marvel Comics. It's a sequel to the 2007 hit film. This one is directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor (the team that brought us two 'CRANK' films and 'GAMER'). It was written by Scott Gimple, Seth Hoffman and David S. Goyer (who's written several B superhero films). The movie isn't really much better or worse than the original, which I thought was passable entertainment, not great but not bad either.In this film Johnny Blaze is hiding out in Eastern Europe when he's contacted by a Monk named Moreau (Idris Elba) who tells him a plot to take possession of a young boy's body. The devil is currently using the human form of a man named Roarke (Ciaran Hinds), who Blaze previously made a deal with and cursed himself with the 'Ghost Rider' monster inside him. Moreau tells him that if he saves the boy, Danny (Fergus Riordan), he could rid himself of the 'Rider' permanently. So Blaze makes it his mission to protect Danny and his mother Nadya (Violante Placido), who are on the run from Roarke's men.The movie is so bad it's good. It's definitely more 'out there' than the original but it also has even less structure. Cage hams it up even worse than usual but is still, like always, likable.

            "content": "I liked the first Ghost Rider and collected comic books for years. I say that to let the reader know that I am also a fan of comic book movies normally and am not a stickler about a movie sticking to comic book canon. My problems with this movie have nothing to do with it being a comic book movie.The special effects in the movie are very bad. I saw it in 2D since I do not like 3D but I do not believe that makes a difference. The new version of the burning skull is much worse than the original. Now, there is tons of smoke most of the time and it is hard to see anything. Like watching polar bears have a milk fight in a blizzard but in black instead of white. The excess smoke and a skull that sometimes blazes but often is just impossible to see in the smoke combine to remove some of the \"cool\" factor of Ghost Rider. In addition, the motorcycle and costume that were cool in the first one are gone. Replaced with a motorcycle that is hard to see (hello smoke) most of the time and when you can see it, it is basically an old motorcycle on fire. Not the awesome chrome and blazes chopper you would expect. The outfit is old leather that appears to be melting when you can see it through the smoke. I suppose that would be fine if you are going for more of a rotted zombie look but that is not Ghost Rider.One of the main bad guys appears to be one of the ghost twins from the Matrix films and is about as interesting although he does have a cool power that the actor does a good job of appearing to enjoy. Sadly, he is on the screen far too seldom and is far too often in GR's smoke.Which brings me to the acting. Normally, I like Nicholas Cage but here he is different. His face is chunkier and he has replaced acting with turning his head sideways. Apparently, someone told him that instead of snappy patter or doing cool things, he would appear so much more menacing if he started just turning his head sideways. So he does it A LOT! As GR, he barely talks except for a few very poor one liners that are akin to Arnold's \"I let him go\" in Commando.In case the poor acting, distracting special effects and poor story are not enough, they also added annoying camera work. At times it has the hand-held shaky method so wonderfully annoying and at other times the director falls in love with closeups that add to confusion when you want to see what is going on.In the first Ghost Rider, he could throw fire, he could use a Pennance (or Soul stare) Gaze. He could defy gravity with his awesome chopper. He made quips and was a hero. They did away with all of that and replaced it with....Nic Cage turning his head sideways. I know that he does gaze at a bad guy but although some might claim that is the Pennance Gaze, nothing seems to happen.Finally, just in case all of the aforementioned was not enough, they made sure to have lots of people talking with odd accents to help make sure the mumbled dialog was harder to understand. An awful movie that I have 2 stars only because of my respect for comic book movies in general and I am glad someone tried to make a sequel. If only they would give the rights back to Marvel and let us get a decent Ghost Rider movie again.",

            "content": "The first Ghost Rider was already a disappointment \u2013 compared to other Marvel adaptations to the cinema, it was far under the average. Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, however, is even worse. It didn't even look like a big Hollywood production \u2013 the special effects and the action sequences were sometimes absurd going to the ridiculous. It looked like a low budget film \u2013 a poor visual with only one or two exciting scenes - if I can call them exciting.Then, there is the plot issue. Those 'blockbusters' are not supposed to have a story with philosophical meanings as they are made aiming pure entertainment, but this one actually didn't even have a story. It was totally redundant, silly and clich\u00e9 \u2013 actually kind of ambiguous because the characters were not well explained or explored - things seemed too much up in the air leading the audience to nowhere.Nicolas Cage also didn't help at all as he was not convincing on what he was doing. But, we can't put all the blame on him \u2013 the character was already badly written by the screenwriters who didn't know how to make him interesting. The Ghost Rider is not the conventional superhero \u2013 he has an obscure personality. So, where is this aspect on the story? Where is the true nature of the Marvel superheroes? In this film, there isn't any.What surprises me most is the fact that this film coasted $75 million and no one knew how to make a good use of this big budget. It was a total waste of money and time \u2013 not only for the audience, but for the actors too. A superhero movie that promises more than it really has to offer.

The movie is a complete disaster from beginning to end, failing to capture the spectator because of a weak storyline, bad timing and management of tension and viewer expectations, and action sequences that besides not having the impact the film maker wishes they had, look pretentious and anti-climatic.About the lines written for the characters, all I can say is: if *I* was invited to work in this movie as an actor (and I'm not an actor by any stretch of the imagination), I'd still be embarrassed to say them and ashamed that other people would watch me doing it.The fight scenes are not believable at all, seems like people are waiting to be punched in the face, shot or whatever it is that's going on at any given moment. The reasons given for the outcome of any conflict in the movie seem like the ones a child would come up with while playing with his little friends.I went to see the movie in a 3D \"XD\" (Extreme Digital) movie theater and even that didn't compensate enough how bad the movie is that I wouldn't be anxious to get out by 3/4ths into watching it.Now here's something I definitely don't get, how can Stan Lee let such a horrible, horrible, horrible abomination like this thing be released under the Marvel name?",

But still, I decided to sit down and watch \"Ghost Rider 2: Spirit of Vengeance\" of out sheer boredom.Let it be said that \"Ghost Rider 2: Spirit of Vengeance\" is actually much better than the first movie. There is a much darker touch and feel to part 2. The movie is more brutal and visual, and you get to see a more violent side to the rider.Storywise, well then I think the movie was halting, because it was a sort of a weird hybrid mix of \"Ghost Rider\" and \"Rosemary's Baby\". It wasn't bad, don't get me wrong, however, it was just something of a clich\u00e9. Nothing surprisingly new or inventive here.The effects and CGI though, were top notch. I liked what I saw and I was thoroughly entertained. I especially like the pyrotechnics and the smoke effects.\"Ghost Rider 2: Spirit of Vengeance\" had a good enough group of actors together. However, in my opinion, the movie was carried by Idris Elba (playing Moreau) and Johnny Whitworth (playing Ray Carrigan). What happened to the Ray character was really awesome. I am not familiar with the \"Ghost Rider\" comic books, so I have no idea whether or not that character is from the pages, but he was still cool and had really interesting powers.For a Marvel movie, then \"Ghost Rider 2: Spirit of Vengeance\" was actually a surprise for me. Especially because I am not too keen on men in spandex tights running around with super powers. \"Ghost Rider 2: Spirit of Vengeance\" was darker, grittier and for a more mature audience.One thing that I just had to shake my head in disbelief at was the in-you-face-lame raised finger morals with the \"an illegal download\" and the \"crime doesn't pay\" comments in the movie. Wow, could it get any more of a clich\u00e9? The \"illegal download\" comment was funny though, but it was not really at place in the intro.",

            "content": "And when I say bizarre, it means the kind of crazy type. This movie is filled with weird humor, crazy 'earthquake' shots during action scenes and fast-paced editing plus crazy acting by Nicolas Cage. But after all, what can we expect from the two guys behind Gamer and the Crank movies. I can never understand why action directors like to shake the camera so hard like a mad bull during an action scene but during dialogue scenes, the camera is perfectly still. In this case, the directors make the same mistake although it is not too bad. I can't imagine how is it like to watch this in 3D. I made a wise choice not to catch it in 3D.The story: It is a fairly simple chase movie. A group of bad guys want to catch a mother's boy. It doesn't say why until the middle of the movie. Johnny Blaze known as Ghost Rider, hiding from sight, is asked to help. Blah Blah. And the story goes on. People chasing people for the boy. One thing that is an improvement over the first movie is that this features some cool action and Ghost Rider has more powers. But unfortunately, when it comes to the action, it is like watching a lost- found footage movie so you can't exactly see the CGI action. The directors injected the movie with a sense of weird humour, even weirder than the first movie. Some can get entertaining but some can become embarrassing. Although some camera shots are good, I would prefer for less frenetic and crazily shaking shots.Overall: Basically, it is for purely entertainment. If you didn't like the first one, you probably won't like the second outing. Although it features more action, the story is really kind of straight forward but also at the same time disjointed. I saw some reviews stating it is the worst superhero movie ever, it is not true. It is just something not really seen in superhero movies. Which superhero movie has crazy camera shots and crazy weird humour? Not to say I hate the directors but I would like a third movie to be directed by a different director.",

            "content": "This new ghost rider ignores the last one and and retells the origin story and also gives us a slightly new take on the Ghost rider himself. This time the Ghost rider is much crazier and a little bit spookier. They've rightly decided to drop the silly monster voice he used to have in favour of a more whispered tone. The ghost riders soul desire now is to destroy anything and everything evil. So when the persona of Johnny Blaze disappears you better start running if you've been a bad boy or girl.The plot is perhaps a little too familiar. The Ghost rider is charged with protecting and accompanying a boy needed for an evil prophecy, an evil prophecy that also involves the demon that cursed Johnny Blaze. We've all seen this story line some where before but really it's just the setting to let Nicholas Cage go crazy with the Freaky new iteration of the Ghost rider, and that is exactly what he does.I was not a fan of the original, i thought it was a little too boring for a movie based on a character possessed by the spirit of vengeance. This one on the other hand has lots of action, being directed by the guys who brought us the Crank movies and Gamer I expected as much. The Ghost rider really takes it to the bad guys this time round and the final battle and highway chase are both pretty spectacular. We also see a couple of new powers, which was quite refreshing.The CG is a little bit hit and miss sometimes it looks fantastic other times the way it is implemented is a little ropey. All round though the effects are pretty impressive and the new look of old flame head with the burnt and craggy old skull and the charred clothes is a much more appealing style for a character this dark.The strangest thing for me is that this didn't really feel like a superhero movie. It felt more like a revenge flick. Add to that the few truly bizarre moments like the scene when Johnny is alone in the Monks caves and you've got something quite removed from the standard. This is no bad thing in my opinion but it may put off some of the marvel movie fans out there.There's a lot to be enjoyed here with some funny over the top one liners. some great action and another great crazy turn from Nicholas Cage. One thing I will suggest is watch the film in 2D as the 3D isn't that great.",

            "content": "\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" is a film that I rate about equally, if not slightly - marginally - better, than 2007's \"Ghost Rider.\" \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" is \"Ghost Rider's\" much-maligned 2012 sequel. I enjoyed watching the original \"Ghost Rider,\" even though I felt that it needed something more. I feel like I got what was missing from the previous movie - more or less - in this steroid-pumped, mind-numbing follow-up.\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" is a sequel that has no real ties to the film that preceded it, which to me is a good thing (because it's actually continuing the story and not repeating it), but it's not a remake (or that other fashionable Hollywood term, \"reboot\"). This sequel has a completely different style, and attitude, from its predecessor. This last part is no doubt due to the co-directing team of Neveldine/Taylor, those guys who brought us the incredibly insane \"Crank\" action movies with Jason Statham.And it has Nicolas Cage; depending on how you view it, having Nicolas Cage as the chain-wielding specter Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider can really either be a good thing or a bad thing. Most seem to agree that it's a bad, bad thing, but not me.I'm not complaining about Cage, like so many other people. But I'm also not saying he's good: he's simply making the best out of the poorly written material he was given. And of course, he does what he can and like the movie, he goes ballistic once things get going: Let the \"Cage\" out of Nicolas Cage!Like I said earlier, the movie has no real connection to \"Ghost Rider,\" other than Cage's Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider (although it really would have been nice to see Peter Fonda, or at the very least, Blaze's former sweetheart Roxanne Simpson played by the lovely Eva Mendes again, but neither one is even mentioned this time around).This time, Johnny Blaze's on the run, hiding out somewhere in Eastern Europe. He's approached by the mysterious French monk Moreau (Idris Elba) to rescue a young boy named Danny (Fergus Riordan), who along with his beautiful mother Nadya (Violante Placido), is being relentlessly pursued by her former boyfriend Ray Carrigan (Johnny Whitworth), who is not-so-secretly an agent of Roarke/The Devil/Mephistopheles (Ciaran Hinds), and eventually becomes a revisionist version of the super-villain Blackout. Roarke needs Danny so he can transfer his soul into his body in a bid to become immortal, or something like that. Only the accursed Johnny Blaze can stop Roarke from bringing about hell on Earth.\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" is a totally different beast from the earlier film. This is good, I feel. With the insane hand-held camera-work by Neveldine/Taylor, it feels even more like a comic book (the film is, after all, based on the Marvel Comics anti-hero of the same name, and the film itself is produced by Marvel Knights - who were behind 2008's \"Punisher: War Zone\" - which aims to provide mature-themed superhero films much like Marvel's MAX imprint of superhero comic books). Ghost Rider was always different from Marvel's staple of super-powered heroes because he was not a mutant (like the X-Men) or mutate (like Spider-Man). No. He was a demon (possessed by the fallen angel Zarathos), a soul-hungry bounty hunter on Earth snatching up souls for The Devil, or Mephistopheles, or whatever satanic name you want to give to him.Cage is decidedly loony from the get-go (and only needs to hear the word \"go\" to be fully turned loose), but the film's real stand-out is the hard-drinking Frenchman Moreau, played by Idris Elba. Elba is quickly becoming an in-demand talent in and outside of Hollywood, and it was interesting watching his portrayal of the blue-eyed, slightly crazed alcoholic monk. Another thing I'll also give this film credit for is that it is much darker than the first movie, and Cage's more-than-slightly unhinged portrayal of Ghost Rider does not see the character uttering bad one-liners every time he takes somebody's soul to Hell. Instead, this Ghost Rider appears to be a real demon and a real force to be reckoned with, with the full powers of Hell at his immediate disposal.I feel that is what elevated this picture slightly above its 2007 predecessor.And further catapulting this vehicle into full-blown camp territory is a cameo from the original \"Highlander\" himself, Christopher Lambert, as a monk who may not be as benevolent as he appears and whose time on the screen is, unfortunately, extremely short (because I don't believe Lambert has appeared in a theatrically released mainstream Hollywood film in more than a decade).Despite the strong critical backlash against it, I think that Neveldine/Taylor did one good thing with \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" by deciding to take it into an even darker, more insane direction than 2007's \"Ghost Rider,\" making it seem even more like a live-action comic book. That's truly one of the better things that can be said about it, in my overall opinion of this picture. Or maybe, that's really the BEST thing that can be truly said about it.6/10",

Something that only Herzog has gotten out of the man since 'Adaptation'.The film may make no sense regarding continuity or hairstyles, but there is much nonsense to be enjoyed out of this, one of the most bizarre comic book movies ever.The plot does seem a little like 'Terminator 2' and the bonding between Blaze and the boy reflects this a lot.Set pieces are crazy, but entertaining, and despite this only being '12a' or 'pg-13', it's a very dark movie with a lot of connotations to the macabre.Support is good, Especially from Hinds and Lambert. Elba is good, but he does spend the majority of he movie saying 'Bonjour' and drinking wine.Visuals are stunning, and if you know the directors, strikingly original.Bu this is Cages movie, and he hasn't been this good since he was in New Orleans.Don't believe the negativity, it's a fun movie, pointless, but a lot of fun.",

There is about three main scenes where Ghost Rider comes out and although generic it was still entertaining and cool to watch. This one for sure is more of a entertaining Ghost Rider movie compared to the 2007 version. Although 2007 version had a bit more of a plot it just wasn't as entertaining as this one. Maybe it's because this one has more of the craziness and more of the essence of a chaotic and even a bit scary Ghost Rider. I don't know what to say about the cinematography though, Neveldine/Taylor is known for doing crazy and chaotic cinematography but I am not really sure if it really helped in this movie. But it also didn't feel like it took away from this movie experience. Nicholas Cage has been getting some bashing from critics lately, but he is Nicholas Cage and he is awesome. Yeah sometimes his acting can be over the top but his performance I found to be always entertaining and fun to watch. And that applies to this one as well, especially the scenes when the Ghost Rider is about to come out from his body and he tries to resist it. Those were some funny and yet entertaining scenes.

            "content": "I was pleasantly surprised by Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, which is to say that I didn't hate it. Well, I didn't actually hate the original Ghost Rider from 2007 (itself based on an occasionally popular Marvel comic book), but aside from some neat special effects that film was pretty mediocre and I figured the sequel would be even worse. Imagine my shock when I found myself actually enjoying Spirit of Vengeance. While hardly extraordinary, the new movie is surprisingly fun.Nicolas Cage is back as Johnny Blaze, the one-time stunt-rider now possessed by an evil spirit that transforms the unfortunate Blaze into an unstoppable beast with a thing for fiery motorcycles and a flaming skull instead of a head. Blaze is now cruising the backstreets of Eastern Europe, doing everything he can to keep the Ghost Rider at bay and himself out of harm's way. But trouble has a way of finding Blaze, and when a mysterious man named Moreau (Idris Elba) brings Blaze the strange story of a special boy on the run from the Devil (played with wicked aplomb by the great Ciar\u00e1n Hinds), the haunted maverick can't turn him down\u0085especially since Moreau promises to cure Blaze of his little problem when the boy is safe and the crisis averted. So Blaze lets the Ghost Rider come alive once again, just in time to save the kid and his mom (the gorgeous Violante Placido) from a batch of thugs. But of course, the trouble\u2014for Blaze, for Moreau, for the boy and his mother\u2014is just beginning.While the script is hardly anything deep or profound, it is well-paced and often surprisingly witty. The script has a pleasant, self-deprecating humor underlying it all, and the various performers all seem to enjoy going along with the outlandish plot. Cage, who is a fan of comics in real life, is well-cast as Blaze, and captures the character's conflicting emotions with expert ease. Not many modern actors play villains better than Hinds, and Placido is surely on track to become one of the most sought-after actresses in the business with her rare combination of melancholy beauty and on screen intensity. There's also an unexpected but welcome role for Christopher Lambert of Highlander fame\u0085though he's nearly unrecognizable beneath a scrawl of tattoos.Special effects are outstanding, and there are a number of out-of-this world action scenes that are major crowd-pleasing moments. The Ghost Rider himself is a fearsome spectacle, and his every appearance brings with it the gleeful anticipation that one of the movie's numerous baddies is going to get his much-deserved punishment in an especially painful\u2014and spectacular\u2014fashion. Best of all, the script touches on the idea that we all have our inner demons to wrestle with, which is all too true, and there is even the hint that the Spirit of Vengeance is perhaps redeemable, and that somewhere deep inside even the Rider might yet harbor Good.In a way you can't enjoy Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance if you're looking for too much, but it's not bad and at times even becomes quite good. If you're a fan of the old comic book then this is a must-see, and even general action fans probably won't regret throwing down the cash for it if they get in the right spirit of things\u0085the Spirit of Vengeance, that is!",

            "review_title": "Far Better Than the First",
            "content": "Back in 2007, audiences were able to see first hand what the Marvel Comic book anti-hero, Ghost Rider, would look like on screen. Unfortunately too few people were pleased with the results. Nicolas Cage who played Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider seemed uncomfortable with his character and didn't quite know how to bring out the true feeling of the movie. Adding to this were the ridiculous villains who barely did anything throughout the film's running time except for bad mouth other characters. Overall, the Ghost Rider of 2007, which was directed Mark Steven Johnson, was outlandishly cartoony and needed improvement on the script.Fast forward to 2012, almost EXACTLY 5 years (just a day apart by release), the next story of Ghost Rider as fans would say - \"Rides again\". Call it a sequel or a remake, one could look at it both ways. Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (GR2) was directed by the Brian Taylor and Mark Neveldine team and I give them a lot of credit for taking on this franchise. It's not easy to impress comic book fans, especially when the first one was more or less a flop. However, this Ghost Rider film, by far, surpasses its predecessor by a significant amount. So what's better in this film - almost everything! Let's start with what I talked about earlier. In the first Ghost Rider, we saw a Nicolas Cage who really did look like he was comfortable in the shoes of Johnny Blaze. It was almost like after his father's death, he fell into a depression that left him absolutely non- emotional. It is much clearer now that the role of Johnny Blaze was made to be so Cage knew what how he had to act out his character. He clearly states several times, that he tries his best to hold back the evil inside him and it's not easy to do. And one must understand, because he has this force inside of him, something that powerful could make him go insane. Nicolas will go insane so don't be surprised when he does. This is the Johnny Blaze that should have been written into the first movie.What's even better is that Cage is actually funnier in this film as Blaze. There aren't any awkward moments like there were in the first film. The script definitely received an improvement over the past five years. There isn't a love interest in this story, which is good because that's probably what was holding the character of Blaze back from 2007. This movie is solely about Blaze trying to take control of the curse he was given. Along with Cage are all different actors to fill the voids of new characters. Violante Placido plays Nadya, a mother who conceived a son (Fergus Riordan), whom now the devil (Ciaran Hinds) wants to claim and it's up to Blaze and a friend named Moreau (Idris Elba) to take on the problem. Moreau is another character who puts some comedy into this action/adventure, horror flick.As for action goes, GR2 has plenty, if not more than the first. And this time, Ghost Rider has some considerable opponents. In 2007, Ghost Rider fought off four demons, Blackheart and his three minions. I couldn't even count the amount of bad guys Blaze fought off...sorry wrong word; killed. Another thing I enjoyed watching. In the first movie, Ghost Rider was a hokey character who never really got to use his true hellish powers. Ghost Rider shows no mercy in GR2. Villains will burn, explode and disintegrate. Ghost Rider's penance stare is no longer the same either. My only complaint is that during certain scenes, there would be different camera shots inserted. Those different camera shots made me feel like something else was happening when really what was happening, WAS happening and not something else. The music is great too. David Sardy who produced the movie's score, has good sense of what this film should sound like and he did just that. Plenty of hard rock guitar with a main theme to boot!Lastly, are the special effects. The portrayal of Ghost Rider is much more accurate. Ghost Rider as a whole is totally charred. Even his jacket bubbles! Keep your eyes open for that because you can really see it, which is absolutely surreal. Making Ghost Rider look even more spectacular is the fire that he is engulfed in. It is no longer a clean flame that cloaked Ghost Rider in 2007. No. It is a torch that creates so much sooty smoke, that it's almost suffocating just to watch it on screen. This is what makes Ghost Rider, Ghost Rider. Something so grungy, that it looks like it came from hell. One other effect I like was one of the devil's helpers who had the power to decay anything he touched; except Twinkies! Ha!For the first time taking on this Marvel character, directors Neveldine and Taylor nailed Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance. With a tuned-up script, better character dialog, accurate special effects, and an exciting score, this film plays better than the original.",

            "content": "This one kicks the first movie straight in the teeth! It is a much better, more exciting and more accurate Ghost Rider film. I LOVED this film, and I would recommend it to anyone, BUT you must know a few things before you go into it. I am a HUGE Ghost Rider fan, he is my favorite comic book character and any fan should like this film, if they don't, then they obviously haven't read the newer comics because they are very close to this style. But before you see this film, understand two things:Ghost Rider is a GRINDHOUSE CHARACTER. He always has been. The comics, especially the newer ones are very schlocky and pulpy. I mean, this is a comic in which the characters include, but are not limited to, hill billy cannibals, a man with an eye ball for his entire head, insane cops, hot virgin nuns toting huge machine guns, and a demon that uses his penis as a tentacled weapon (this same demon breaks a man's back by shoving the guy's head up his ass and then refers to him as \"Buttview\" the rest of the comic). This is midnight movie material. And you must understand this first.Second is the directors. These are the guys who did Crank, Crank 2: High Voltage, and Gamer. They have a very chaotic, energetic, and unique style of filming. They shot on cables and roller blades for some shots. And the editing is even more insane.This understood, you will thoroughly enjoy this film. It has Ghost Rider being awesome, demonic, and kicking ass. Nicolas Cage is gleefully over the top and his portrayal of Johnny Blaze is MUCH better than in the first film. He is sarcastic, dark, and crazy, which is good for this character. I mean, his head catches fire, he's not exactly going to be the most stable human being. Next is Idris Elba, who is probably the best part of the film. You really can tell he had a blast as this character and he adds charisma to the film and is truly a joy when he's on screen. Johnny Whitworth does a very good job as Blackout, who is VERY accurate to the comic's character. I was afraid because the directors said they didn't base him on the comic's version. But whether that was a lie, or by complete accident, they got him nearly dead on. They even gave him more powers which make him more of a force to be reckoned with. His Blackout is very Mic Jager/Rock and Roll influenced, which is fine because in the newer comics, Blackout was very \"punk rock\" in his attitude.There are some missteps and the film isn't perfect. The story isn't that in depth, the dialogue is less than stellar and it is a bit short. But when it comes to doing the character justice, this is the best adaptation out there.All in all, if you have read this review and you think this is something you might be interested in, GO SEE IT! It is much better than the first one, and much more exciting. Ghost Rider is nuts and vicious which is what his character is suppose to be. It has a very pulpy feel and that totally works for this character. The action is intense with the camera angles putting you right there in the middle of it. I really hope these guys come back and do a third and make it bigger and better. Go see this film for a good old fashioned pulp good time. And hell, who wouldn't wanna see Ghost Rider making a hell fire mining bagger and wrecking a dozen guys with it?",

            "content": "If you like action flicks that barely have a plot, then this a movie for you. Not that the first movie was any better. But, I was really hoping this movie would take off, and make it so that we could see another movie to fallow. Nothing in this film relates to the first movie. At the end of \"Ghost Rider\" Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) states that he \"is going to own this curse.\" In this movie, he doesn't seem to wanna do that. He wanted to get rid of his curse. What happen to I wanna own it? Did the director not even see the last movie? I did manage to give this movie a 5 out 10. Mainly for the action. Despite the fact that his movie is poorly written, it does have some great action. And of course, visual effects. One thing that I did like about this movie, is that we got to see an action scene take place during the day. I did not read the comic books but, after seeing the first movie, I always had a feeling that Ghost Rider, or The Rider could do more then just fight during the night. So, it was nice to see a day action scene. Another thing that I did like is that instead of trying to throw in all different types of Characters, they tried to focus in on The Devil and his I guess you could call him, his puppet. His slave, if you will. In the first movie, all the Characters basically die off before you even get to know them. The main issues with this movie is that, they lacked in Character development. And, of course, telling a good story. Take The Devil for example. We know very little of his plan, and the little bit that we are told, does not make for much of a plot. Another issue with this movie is what takes place between action scenes. The scripted seems rushed. I have no clue as to what is going on, and why it is happening. Basically, everything other then the action that takes place, is boring. To sum everything up, I did not hate the movie, I just disliked it. So, just watch it for the action.",

Loved it. 10/10 What you need to know about this movie before you go and see it.1. The action never stops. It's a lot like Conan or Van Helsing in that sense, but - here - there is also a story being told and all the action fits into that story. Failing to allow for that is what makes movies like Conan or Van Helsing so disappointing.2. This movie is visually interesting. When the camera points at a wall, the wall is interesting. When the camera pans over to a field beside a road, there are cool things to look at in there. When the characters are standing around talking, they are doing so in a cool-looking place. Always. And then there are the special effects. GR looks awesome. And then there is the editing... the split screen choices... the animation... Everything pops up, advances the story, and - pretty much - isn't used again.3. The story is simple, tight, and never stops advancing. The narrative immediately establishes who the bad guy is, what the bad guy wants, and why the good guys must stop him. And that's it. If you can get past the first five minutes, and are happy to accept who A, B and C are (and why they are doing what they are doing), then the rest is just the fun of watching them fight it out. And it is fun.4. It's cool. As a huge lifelong fan of Ghost Rider, I love the 1970s comic book, I come to this movie with certain expectations. Above all else: GR must be cool/badass/awesome/etc. And in this movie... he is. Sometimes the henchmen are standing around, with their jaws drooping, wondering 'What the **** is he at?' And that's what I was hoping to see.5. This is an action movie, first. And a superhero/supernatural movie, second. Remove the crazy stuff, and you've got a standard A-to-B action flick. Hero-with-a-past goes up against slick-baddie to save an innocent. Even with all this sexy icing on top, the movie has a keen sense of what it actually is. And is all the better for it.6. Nicholas Cage is fun. And it looks like he is having fun. Cage eats scenery and blows everyone (except Idris Elba) off the screen. There are a couple of scenes that are a hoot. And you just want to watch them over and over. Great fun. Plus: it's funny. Cheeky funny.Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is insane. One of the most visually interesting movies I've ever seen.

The first time that I watched this, I couldn't believe that this movie was made by Marvel. I was so astounded. I kept watching the movie again and again. I was beginning to love it.When Ghost Rider (2007) came out, I loved it. And when I heard that there was a sequel coming out, I was so excited. The thing that most excited me was the amazing and awesome looking poster with the Rider on his motorcycle, swinging his flaming chain around, and the poster read \"in 3D\". Keep in mind that this is not anything like Iron Man or Hulk, even though this movie is produced by Marvel Studios. I think the film is good because it is full of cool action-packed scenes and has a decent plot.This action-fantasy stars Nicolas Cage and Idris Elba as they take you on a fiery ride you'll never forget. I would recommend this to any Marvel superhero fan or people that enjoyed the first Ghost Rider, and if possible, try to see the movie in 3D.",

            "content": "Action lovers! This is the right place for y'all.Embark on an amazing sojourn to awesomeness. This is exactly how the first part should have been 'presented' which however was a debacle owing to the lack of oomph factor. A perfect example of how a change in the direction of a franchise could actually assist in escalating the standards of a flick.I think Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor did a fabulous job. Bits of Crank franchise and Jonah Hex came revisiting with their typical style of direction. Screenplay was good then again we should not forget who the legendary writer was \u2013 The exceptional Goyer himself. Yet another great story under his baggage, Goyer never fails to surprise (I am still waiting like hell for the third Batman venture). Nicolas gets better and better. We have seen him do crazy movies and we have seen him do sensible ones. Sometimes we have discovered him in every single Hollywood flick. It would definitely be justified if we start using 'As busy as \u0085.. Nicolas Cage' phrase to define diligence. He has come up with really class acting in several good flicks before and we have seen the likes of Face Off, City of Angels, Lord of War, Bad Lieutenant, Next, Con Air, Matchstick Men, Windtalkers, Captain Corelli's Mandolin, The Rock and of course the National Treasure franchise. His experience has elevated his standards for sure and acting comes naturally to him now. The greatest thing about the movie was its constant entertainment. The flick kept on making the provision of reasons to keep the adrenaline rush surging, gushing and soaring all the time. The cameras caught minute details like the burnin' ride of Blaze and the metamorphosing of Blaze to Ghost Rider along with providing a better glimpse of the laughing spook and the formidable protagonist. Cage raged and fumed like inferno and basked in ashes of the villains throughout the flick. That is how we expect a comic to be \u2013 incessantly thrilling and exhilarating and that was exactly how the movie was designed. Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance was all about Nicolas Cage and his alter self Ghost Rider and I don't mean that figuratively. It was him all along that carried the movie pretty well. The villain Roarke was as good as non-existent and naught, his impotence eventually - equally frustrating (Cage made him look like a chihuahua). Johnny Whitworth delivered a little bit entertainment however it still wizened against the mighty Rider's performance. The sequel again failed to match the standards of any other 'really good' superhero flick in terms of ultimate demo yet stood firm with the mere class, style, laugh, ride, shrug, roar, spin, nods and dance (watch out for those moves) of Cage.Note: The flick is not for whiners and crybabies who ask for Academy type material all the time. Strictly for Cage's fans, Goyer's die-hards and for entertainment seekers.",

I truly believe a real movie reviewer should dissect the soul of movies, as opposed to merely summarizing plots - which any 14-year old could do.Embarrassingly low IMDb rating for a Hollywood superhero-movie this unique and risky! GR2 creates a twisted and dark universe with visually compelling night-scenes bathed in Absinthe-green color-tones contrasting the day-time's over-exposed sharp white daylight. Equally compelling are the cartoon-universe's morally ambiguous characters - including the Morphine-popping, self-loathing protagonist Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider (Nicolas Cage)! The line between good and evil is thin here. Cage injects drops of his former manic acting-style known from early-career surrealistic masterpieces, e.g. \"Wild At Heart\" (David Lynch, 1990) which will please his long-time followers.GR2 does admittedly have faults. It suffers from the standard sub-par, dumbed-down dialog of big-budget blockbusters, and its audience are asked to accept some far-fetched events so fantastic they would be fatal to the credibility of any storyline... normally! However, GR2 is not normal. Do NOT expect sophisticated plot and realism! Watch it for the weird world and sensatory experience: the GR2 trip is instinctive - NOT intellectual! When you open your mind to such an experience, the aforementioned faults become irrelevant.Consider the odds: it is a closely-controlled, big-budgeted blockbuster sequel targeted at the horrified-of-boredom, escapism-craving superhero- movie audience (which is how Hollywood studios wrongfully conceive us...), and despite all this, GR2 is clearly a work of its own, therefore considerably more interesting than its by-the-book predecessor \"Ghost Rider\" (Mark Steven Johnson, 2007)....And as a result, sadly also widely misunderstood, hence the criminally low IMDb rating. Risk-taking is not a quality in itself, but when it results in an different AND fascinating spin on the arch- American superhero-movie genre, it deserves to be rewarded. GR2 is not a masterpiece, merely a slightly left-field, good movie. 7/10",

Well Cage is back and he promised us a little something extra. What we got was a lot worse. We have a plot of no real significance, where the devil is trying to kidnap a boy so he can take his body. Ghost Rider tries to stop it. This films biggest crime is being insanely boring. Cage showed us how to have stupid violent fun with Drive Angry, so why can't he do this correctly? It's set in 'Eastern Europe', a place with no discernible landmarks or colour. It's like the old quarry sets from Doctor Who. Everything is just dusty and gray. Nothing else happens. We have a 1st, 2nd and 3rd act fight scene, which are all the same. The actors are barely that, with only Elba giving it a shot. Cage just comes off as confused. It's like he saw that 'Nic Cage Loses His Sh*t' internet video and wanted to create more material for it. I think they tried to develop a caring relationship between him and a child, but what the hell is this? ET? The direction is also poor. Neveldine and Taylor may be able to create weird and exciting visuals for things like Crank, but this needs some focus. A few monologues suggest that it wants to be a comedy but the jokes fall flat.

Who says that CGI is worthless?In this one, Nick plays the scenes with his own face like an alky who has just woken with the shakes, because he has regrets over being a monster. Violante Placido plays the unmentionable love interest. She was raped by the Devil and gave birth to his son because you know what schmucks male-dominated governments are. They won't let you get an abortion even when you've been raped by the Devil, even though that happens all the time; plus Mother Love and an enormous rack. Idris Elba plays a monk with a Russian accent. Did he get rejected for the role of Rasputin by some racist producer and he's going to show them?Anyway, the story, such as it is, involves a lot of CGI fighting and fire and Miss Placido crawling on the ground so that her breasts hang down and look even larger. Apparently this was too difficult for one director, so they used two, but to make up for that, they only get one name each.I forgive Mr. Elba, because he is a British actor, and they don't turn down work.

GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE is the ultimate b-movie complete with b-grade actors (welcome back to the silver screen Christopher Lambert), a generic plot (the only way for the devil's power to survive is by taking over the young body of his progeny), lots of guns, a villainous threat whose true evil power is the insane amount of clich\u00e9 dialogue, and a feisty damsel in distress. Yet movies like these always have a way of capturing a little of that comicbook magic empowering their young-ish fanboy fanbase with elements of cool.This sequel finds Nic Cage hiding out from the world \u2013 and his curse \u2013 in Eastern Europe where he rambles about evil as his eyeballs bug out of their sockets. When not being a true-to-life documentary showcase, Cage reprises his role as the quirky and sometimes-demonic Johnny Blaze who gets thrown into action alongside the always-hip Idris Elba, who is apparently the go-to guy for comicbook actions films \u2013 this being his third. Gone is the forced romance from the first film. Instead, directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor focus on Blaze's anguish and a cure for his curse. The directors also get clever with the Rider's look giving him a simple, charred look like he's been on the grill for a week too long, adding to the anguish. Their choppy editing and shaky camera work lend to the Nu Metal look that is very chic in Hot Topic. Unfortunately, the film's simplistic plot gets too convoluted degrading further into the typical you've-seen-it-a-million-times-before shoot 'em up and highway chase scene. Ghost Rider's dialogue is kept to a minimum as much as Cage's is not \u2013 but he never gets to truly cut loose into a- quality action, even though it appeared that the f/x budget would allow such, and, surprisingly, doesn't get a lot of face time. And a Ghost Rider film without Ghost Rider, is just another bravura performance of Cage's body language. GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE offers a fun, but not all-together great, look at property that has the potential to be so much hotter.",

I'm not really a fan of their hyper-kinetic direction - in fact, I don't think many people are - and it really drags down the quality of this otherwise typical storyline.Then again, to be totally honest, the first ghost rider wasn't really all that great to begin with. Nicolas Cage is, shall we say, adequate at best, playing a guy who undergoes a Hulk-style transformation into a flaming skeleton at regular intervals. Truth be told, it's all pretty silly and the narrative is as a lightweight and uninteresting as you'd expect (something about Ghost Rider trying to save a kid from the clutches of the Devil).The best thing about the film? It has to be the ever-reliable Ciaran Hinds, perfectly cast as the Devil and delivering a top-notch performance to boot, just as you'd expect from one of the greatest - and most underrated - actors of our time. What else to say? Well, Cage's performance is occasionally entertaining for all the wrong reasons - watch out for that \"scraping at the door\" breakdown - and Violante Placido is easy on the eye. Idris Elba bags a neat supporting role. And some of the CGI-imbued action isn't too shabby.

The movie has some stuff going for it, but overall I did not find it as enjoyable as the first film, which may as well not exist as the only thing tying this film to that one is Nicolas Cage. He is back, and in this one he just seems off, acting a bit to crazy for this particular role. Still, he was into the movie which is more than can be said for the rest of the actors and actresses in this one with the exception of Johnny Whitworth as one of the main baddies who I believe turns into Blackout in this film though no mention of the comic book character is made. This is not surprising as a lot of comic book films seem to ignore the villain or hero's more well known name and instead use the character's regular birth name. The story in this one has a boy being pursued by Satan, Peter Fonda being replaced by Ciran Hinds which was disappointing to me as I liked Fonda in the first film. Once again the first film seemed to be ignored completely. The boy's mother had a relationship with one of the men pursuing her and her son and this character is bland and pointless. The only character more pointless is Christopher Lambert's character who turns up later in the film. Still, the film had a couple of good action scenes to go along with all the drivel used to set up said action sequences. Ghost Rider looked cooler in this film, he is the only one that can be said to look better as the film overall has a cheaper look and feel to it. One can certainly tell the budget was slashed in half here. The parts of the film that were like drawings showing you what was happening to me seemed like a cheap way of getting out of doing the actual scene. Still, it passed the time okay, nothing I am going to rush out to see again mind you. This film is also the first film I have seen in 3D, and I will never watch another film in 3D if I can help it. Really added nothing to the film and it made my eyes feel very strained and weak for a couple of hours afterward. I was afraid of that cause I do have a lazy eye and it is affected by being tired or strained so 3D is just not for me. So a couple of good action scenes and a diversion, but this Ghost Rider, to me, just did not burn as brightly as the first film.",

            "content": "I saw a sneak preview of this movie w/ somewhat 'curious' expectations. This is mainly because of the style of 'Crank' directors Neveldine/Taylor. Being a fan of the Ghost Rider comic book, I was a bit disappointed in the original film as I found it a bit flat. However I gave it a bit of a pass because I knew that 'Daredevil' director Mark Steven Johnson's style was simply not suited for this type of subject matter. So whenever I watch that installment I can't help but feel a bit torn because although I didn't care for GR1 overall, I have to admit that there were aspects of it that I can appreciate.But after watching GR: Spirit of Vengeance I was very refreshed and impressed. They gave it more of a 'cult film' feel which I thought was PERFECT for this project. Neveldine/Taylor seem to never be scared to take risks w/ going outside the box of contemporary filmmaking and GR:SOV is a true testament of that. Since I can relate this feeling w/ the one I got when I first saw Lexi Alexander's \"Punisher: War Zone\" I strongly anticipate that this film is gonna take a beating from the masses. But I don't care because IMHO, the mainstream nowadays apparently have no idea of original thought and much of their opinions are spoon-fed to them by corporate media.Also what helped make this work is the performance of all the actors, ESPECIALLY NIC CAGE! I admit I had my doubts about him reprising the Johnny Blaze character but it's quite evident he was in tune w/ the directors' vision. SOV (like PWZ) is clearly a 'love-it-or-hate-it' movie which works for me because since movies like this don't rack up at the box office and tend to be viewed as commercial flops, they come out on home releases pretty quick at very reasonable prices (w/ extras to boot). IMO this film will make most of its money on DVD/blue-ray sales.Not wanting to spoil it for anybody, all I can say is if you go see GR:SOV, \"try\" to have an open mind. Otherwise you might just be setting yourself up to be disappointed w/ no fault being that of the movie. The only reason I didn't give this a higher rating is because I thought it was a bit short (1:36) and I admit I'm a bit torn because perhaps it may have been best not to draw it out.Chalk up another 'underground hit' for Marvel Knights!!!",

            "content": "Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2012) * (out of 4)Nicolas Cage is back in action playing the Ghost Rider who this time must try and save a young boy whose mother (Violante Placido) made a deal with the Devil before he was born. Now, the mother is trying to protect the boy but needs help from the fire skull. I found the first GHOST RIDER to be a decent popcorn flick but it seems the majority of the people disliked it so I was a little confused as to who would greenlight a sequel but it's clear that they were just trying to get Cage at a discount price as nothing in this film works. It's early in 2012 but you've got a contender for one of the worst films of the year and I really hope they don't get any worse than this. There's really nothing working right with this thing and you can start with the poor CGI effects. The effects worked in the first movie but better technology hasn't leaked over to this film because the effects seem to change from scene to scene and especially when it comes to the fire. Another problem is the story itself is just so poorly written and constructed that you really have no emotion with any of the characters and to be honest you don't care if the kid lives or dies. It also doesn't help that the characters are saying some of the most pathetic lines of dialogue in recent memory. As bad as this film is you're probably hoping it could enter the \"so bad it's good\" category but sadly it never reaches that. I'm sure it might have five or six years ago back when the \"Cage doing Cage\" bit was funny but it's growing quite tiresome. I enjoy Cage's \"bad\" performances because he's usually quite funny in how over-the-top he gets but it doesn't work here and instead of laughing at him you're really starting to feel bad. I'm sure he knows this type of film is crap and he's playing camp to try and add some value but it's wearing very thin. It also doesn't help that the supporting players are all forgettable. And lets not even get started on the horrid direction during the action scenes, which are so poorly constructed that they nearly put me to sleep a couple times. And those curious about the 3D, save your dollars as they're really poorly done with only a few rocks and flames coming towards you. GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE is a bad movie and one so bad that a better option than seeing it would be to pour gasoline on yourself and strike a match.",

            "content": "This is one of those occasions when the sequel is better than the original. And given the fact that the lead role is still held by Johnny Cage, that's a big deal. Don't get me wrong, the guy has potential, but he kinda became a warning sign of bad movies. Now, first of all, the Ghost rider itself became much more realistic, as in it doesn't look like a cutout from a PC game put in an actual movie, as the first did. I mean in the first one it was obvious from the first second that the rider was CGI. Second, the settings. It is more gritty, more dark, more dark ages. That's mainly because the movie was shot in Romania. And those parts of Romania are exactly the same in the every day life as it was shown in the movie. I know this because I live in that country. And for a Ghost rider movie, it was a pretty inspired choice of settings. By the way, that huge castle at the beginning of the movie, that is real too. Now, the plot. It is shallow. But this is okay since it is a comic book movie. And is one that doesn't really takes itself seriously. So basically you can enjoy it. Idris Elba really steals the show with his character of Monroe. Another interesting thing, well for me at least, were the choices of transportation of the villains at the beginning of the movie. I mean, the devil arrives by train... CFR (Romanian railways) has the most foul and hellish trains ever, so I guess it was fitting in an ironical way. And those 4x4 cars in the first car chase? All made by Dacia, and they are like less than 10K $ right of the production line. So you can see that some serious dime was saved on this movie. All together this is a perfect movie for one of those afternoon or nights when you want to see a movie, but a brain free one. I would buy the DVD, if it were on sale...",

It's so intentionally ridiculous that it ends up being bad ass. It's not supposed to be taken seriously-- it's supposed to be fun, and fun is exactly what you'll get when you watch it.I didn't like the original movie much-- the whole thing felt pretty artificial to me. The special effects looked too much like a video game, and the action felt the same way. It seemed to be stuck in the \"superhero movie\" mold, which is inappropriate since The Rider is not a superhero, and should not be in a superhero movie. This time around, he's appropriately placed in a straight-up action film with over-the-top violence. The performance Nicolas Cage delivers in this film, both as The Rider and as Johnny Blaze is a deliciously chaotic joy to watch unlike the sedated performance in the first film, and that's part of how this movie succeeds where its predecessor failed. \"Spirit of Vengeance\" truly lives up to the term \"action packed,\" and has a good self-aware sense of humor about itself.and we get to see Nicolas Cage eat the scenery as a possessed man in a way that's both entertaining and oddly believable. The Rider himself Also, I have to mention Idris Elba, since he steals pretty much every scene he's in with his great performance as an alcoholic warrior monk. The Rider himself also has way more personality himself-- he's not just a metal-less terminator in chains this time, but a psychotic entity who gets his jollies by killing people. You will see him laugh, cackle and mug at the camera with a muppet-like grin while he pisses fire. The Rider feels like a real character this time, and in addition to being a bad ass he's actually funny!I also need to note that the special effects are far more realistic this time, which is appropriate since this movie feels like a grindhouse-style midnight movie rather than an over-polished Hollywood blockbuster. I'm surprised that a movie with a budget of only 70 million can have fire effects that are this good, since even big-budget films often struggle with it. Hats off to the animators!Overall, I'd be hesitant to even call this a sequel to the first one if it weren't for the fact that it stars Nicolas Cage and picks up roughly 8 years where the original left off. You don't need to see the original to get into it, and it's overall a very different kind of movie. It's all the better for it, too! If you enjoy over-the-top movies like Drive Angy, Kick Ass and Crank, you will eat this film up. If you are expecting something serious-- I hate to break it to you, but you probably suck at evaluating movie trailers. If it looks like something you'd like, then give it a try and I'm pretty certain that you won't be disappointed.",

However a mysterious man calls him out of hiding saying he is the only one who can save a 10 or 11 year old boy from the clutches of the devil. So, the Rider, rides again! After this follows some brilliantly executed chase and action sequences that look even better in 3D! The problem that I had with with this movie is that they took out the humane touch to it. Almost the whole movie is full of mindless action sequences. I'm not complaining though. They should have brought back Roxanne Simpson(Eva Mendes) from the first movie. The film has absolutely no story at all! It's like as though the directors just thought of making Ghost Rider 2, with big special effects & shooting it in 3D but didn't bother to write a proper script! A note, on the performances. Nicolas Cage is impressive as an older, angrier & trying to fight his curse, Johnny Blaze. Ciaran Hinds has played the role of the devil, Roarke to perfection. The kid & the mom are not bad either. So, I would recommend you to watch Ghost Rider: Spirit Of Vengeance if you love special effects & REAL 3D!

After deciding to keep the Ghost Rider persona at the end of the first film, Johnny is now finding the burden a bit heavier than he expected, when he is called upon to help preserve the life of a small boy, the Devil's son, who the Devil intends to pour his essence into. This is going to be bad news all round, so Johnny chucks in his five penn'orth.The original Ghost Rider movie was not the success it was hoped it would be: this one goes about things in a somewhat different matter. Directed (but not written) by Neveldine/Taylor (the Crank movies), GR2 shows clear evidence of their hyper-kinetic style and love of the outrageous. Blaze is portrayed as a man on the age of sanity or, perhaps somewhat on the other side of it. One can understand how this might have happened to the character in the years since he acquired his lodger, and it is an interesting and entertaining development for the character - Cage has a ball when mad cackling is called upon. Ciaran Hinds (standing in for Peter Fonda as the Devil, known here as Roark) plays broad, but never quite achieves the level of sinister which would have helped. Idris Elba lends charisma to a part which requires little else of him. Anthony (Giles in Buffy) Head shows up briefly and gets bumped off. And the lad and his Mom are played by people I have never heard of and never expect to hear from again.So - is it any good? Because it died in the States, doing even worse than its predecessor. Well, I suggest that anyone who expects films about a bloke with a burning skull riding a flaming motorbike to be anything other than popcorn movies has got unreasonable expectations. GR2 has an adequate story, adequate performances, several terrific action set pieces, excellent visual effects, and some sequences - the opening motor bike / car chase where the 3D is amazing. The hand-held Bourne camera work has got really old now, but I suppose it is one of the things Neveldine/Taylor do. It's fine for long shots but I still hate it close up.I think this film is an improvement over the first one, but it doesn't have the heart which Marvel has been fairly successful in bringing to its comics-based movies.",

The acting all around is good. I was pleasantly surprised to see Christopher Lambert in here. I love that voice.Some of the best things about Nicolas Cage are his expressions.

            "content": "Nicolas Cage reprises his role as the incendiary Marvel Comics character Johnny Blaze, an Evel Knievel-type motorcycle stunt rider who sold his soul to the Devil, in \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance.\" This impudent, 95-minute, PG-13 opus is a reboot of the franchise rather than a sequel. The original \"Ghost Rider\" (2007) was a standard issue supernatural hero origins epic. Alternately adventurous, amorous, and absurd, this lightweight, middle-of-the-road, action mash-up was as tame as it was tedious. When the Rider wasn't tangling with either Mephistopheles or his rebellious son Blackheart, director Mark Steven Johnson pitted him against the local police. The protagonist's outlandish motorcycle stunts amounted to cheesy hokum. Further, \"Ghost Rider\" imitated at least two scenes from the infinitely superior \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\": Blackheart's assault on a biker bar and the Rider's encounter with the cops. Nevertheless, fans wallowed in this conventional nonsense, and \"Ghost Rider\" coined a fortune. Peter Fonda made a momentary but memorable impression as a sartorially elegant Mephistopheles, but the Rider's face-off against Blackheart (Wes Bentley made-up like a minstrel singer) to rescue his girlfriend Roxanne Simpson yielded no surprises. \"Crank\" co-directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor along with \"Blade\" scenarist David S. Goyer have drastically altered the franchise. Gone is Johnny Blaze's girlfriend. Gone are Johnny's two guilty pleasures: eating jelly beans and listening to the Carpenters. Gone is Johnny's playful paranoia about his supernatural alter-ego. \"Ghost Rider\" qualified as a Disney superhero movie without any grit. If the two movies were compared to motorcycles, \"Ghost Rider\" would be a quiet, graceful Honda Gold Wing and \"Spirit of Vengeance\" would be a noisy, skeletal Yamaha dirt bike. Moreover, the color of Ghost Rider's skull depicts the tonal differences. In the original, the skull is white, but in the reboot black.\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" dispenses with Johnny's earlier 'fear no evil' credo. He dreads his lack of control over his combustible alter-ego. Indeed, he has fled in fear to Eastern Europe to lay low until he can come to grips with his condition. This doesn't discourage a wine-guzzling, motorcycle-riding, French monk, Moreau (Idris Elba of \"Thor\"), from tracking Johnny down and approaching him with a proposition. If Blaze will protect a helpless child from his malevolent father, Moreau assures him that his renegade order of monks will help him remove his curse. Moreau and his cassock-clad compatriots have Danny (Fergus Riordan of \"Fragile\") along with his attractive Gypsy mom, Nadya (Violante Placido of \"The American\"), hidden in their remote monastery. Basically, Danny is the spawn of the Devil. Moreau warns his father superior, Benedict (Anthony Head of \"Scoop\"), that Satan will stop at nothing to possess Danny. Basically, the Devil has taken the form of a human, Roarke (Ciar\u00e1n Hinds of \"Excalibur\"), while he treads the Earth. Unfortunately, Satan's power is waning because Roarke's body is deteriorating. Satan needs Danny's body for a ritual enacted at dawn before the Winter Solstice so he can rejuvenate his dominance. Interestingly, this child in jeopardy plot resembles a similar storyline in an earlier Cage movie \"Drive Angry.\" Satan dispatches a thoroughly obnoxious hooligan, Ray Carrigan (leering Johnny Whitworth of \"Limitless\"), to get Nadya and Danny after they escape from the monastery. Meanwhile, Johnny discovers he has a psychic connection with Danny and sets off in hot pursuit. The Ghost Rider uses his deadly Penance Stare on some of Carrigan's men. When he isn't looking, Carrigan blasts him with enough firepower to land an unconscious Johnny in a hospital. Predictably, not only does Johnny recover, but he also befriends Nadya, and the two elude the authorities. Eventually, Johnny and Nadya free Danny from Carrigan's clutches in a larger-than-life confrontation at a construction site. The Ghost Rider converts a gigantic crane into a blazing juggernaut to combat his enemies. Johnny kills Carrigan, but Satan refuses to let his lieutenant lay down on the job. Instead, Satan revives Carrigan and provides him with the diabolical power to rot anything he touches. The best joke shows Carrigan destroying everything for a snack but a Twinkie! Carrigan emerges with a mop of long white hair that makes him look like bluesman Johnny Winter. Indeed, Satan and Carrigan take Johnny Blaze to the mat before our hero receives help in the last quarter hour from the lad he is supposed to save.Basically, \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" qualifies as a darker, more sarcastic saga. Unlike the original, the reboot emphasizes Johnny's contagious ability to incinerate everything he handles. At one point, Danny asks Johnny what would occur he had to pee as the Rider, and we are treated to glimpse of the Rider performing figure eights with his urine. As clever as this visual gag is, it doesn't match the Twinkie joke. Everything about the \"Ghost Rider\" reboot has fringe written on it rather than mainstream. Unlike the original, every character experiences a radical change. Johnny Blaze suffers like the Hulk. Carrigan changes from an ordinary hood to a supernatural ruffian. Even the Devil admits the pact he struck with Johnny was his worst. Neveldine and Taylor with their penchant for making R-rated movies were probably not the ideal directors for this PG-13 outing. Aside from emphasizing anarchy, Neveldine and Taylor streamline the action, eliminating superfluous love interests and law enforcement intrusions. They ramp up the violence with their guerrilla filmmaking style that makes everything look harrowing. The special effects are staggering. You can feel the heat of the Ghost Rider. Cage gives a better performance with a greater expressive range since his character evolves rather than remains static. Idris Elba is charismatic, while Johnny Whitworth is audaciously villainous. Christopher Lambert makes little impression as a tattooed monk, but it's great to see him again. The post-production 3-D effect rarely enhances \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" since nothing comes flying out at you during the fracas. Ultimately, this above-average reboot will aggravate anybody who wanted something more conventional along the lines of the original.",

In case you haven't worked it out, I'm old, too, so this isn't a kids eye view you're getting here.The first Ghost Rider movie did plenty right, but also a fair bit wrong, and I get the feeling that the people involved in GR:SOV are trying to bring more of the feel of the comics to the screen.This may not have an adult rating, but there's plenty of death and destruction, although as it's mainly 'fantasy' violence (such as bad guys getting splattered into ashes by Ghostie's chains) I guess they didn't tick too many of the censor's 'naughty' boxes. It might be too much for younger kids, though, so don't say you weren't warned.Plotwise, nothing gets too complicated. The agent of the Devil who made the original 'deal' with Johnny Blaze, Roarke, made another deal with a desperate, near death young woman, and fathered her child. Now the child, who is half demon, is thirteen, Roarke will pour himself into his body at the anointed time (there's ALWAYS a prophecy, huh?), which will be strong enough to contain him indefinitely (his human body isn't strong enough for his awesomeness, or something) and 'cast a shadow over the earth'. Nasty... and guess who has to stop him (in a rather Terminator 2 way, actually).There's more, of course, including an actual decent villain this time round in the shape of Johnny Whitworth. Nic Cage plays Blaze as a man always trying to contain the rider, meaning he gets to do his 'I'm mad, me' act, the one he loves so much, although at least this time the character is straightforward and more fun for it. There's some nice little voice overs explaining the back stories of Blaze and the Rider himself, with nice comic graphics along the way. I won't ruin the ending, but I actually sat there and hoped for another sequel, as the Ghost Rider is given a whole new dimension.So we have a basic but decent horror plot, good acting, excellent action sequences and a satisfactory ending. It's not perfect, and can drag a bit at times, but it's a solid, entertaining horror romp that sits up and begs for a follow up. As far as the 3D is concerned, don't go out of your way, as it's rarely more than functional.",

            "content": "I was ready for Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance to be a wild ride of insanity, because the directors are the type of guys who seem like they would take everything over the top. On occasion the movie certainly got wacky but it never locked in on that style for long. Whether it was studio meddling, the restrictions of a PG-13 rating, or general reluctance to push the envelope, the movie fell flat. It never settles in on a proper tone, because sometimes we watch Nicolas Cage unhinged like only he can do as he's half-transforming into the Ghost Rider, but other times we have serious conversations about destiny and regret. Often these two totally different styles of scenes will come one right after the next, or Nicolas Cage will go from 1 to 100 within a single shot. Sometimes the bad guys seem frightening and intimidating, and other times they come across as bumbling and goofy. Even the characters themselves don't have consistent personalities from one scene to the next (or even consistent accents in the case of Idris Elba.)I've never been a big fan of Ghost Rider as a character, and Spirit of Vengeance did not help with that at all. Here they try to overcomplicate the origins of the Rider, probably in an attempt to explain why he's a good guy, but none of it makes sense anyways so I'm not sure why they feel compelled to work so hard at justifying the character's existence. I was also surprised they added literally zero special effect in this film to his penance stare, so it's just these long goofy shots where we see a CGI burning skull staring at an actor who is doing his best to look like something is happening to him. Meanwhile, we get a new villain that can magically make everything decay until he can't or doesn't want to for the convenience of the plot. It's all nonsense, and since the story lacks structure, I never felt a desire to try and comprehend what was happening. While a few of the visual effects were fun, and they used some interesting shot selection in the action scenes, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is still a bad film that actually managed to be worse than the origin story.",

Nicolas Cage is funny as Johnny Blaze, and gives a good performance. The rest of the cast is not so good. All in all. A very entertaining piece of cinema. 7/10. For good entertainment. Also for good effects. The effects on ghost rider look way more better than the effects they put on him in the first part. It gave a more realistic feeling into actually thinking that his skull is on fire. The skull of ghost rider looks burnt due to the cause of the fire.

            "content": "I read most of the reviews of SOV and I am sad to say I disagree with most of them. This movie was not all that bad! Its about Johnny Blaze trying to save this kid Danny who supposedly is the son of the Devil, JB, still struggling with the curse of being the Ghost Rider, is asked by a secret sect of the church to save a boy from the devil in return the church promises to end his curse once and for all. Mostly the movie is about the boy and his mother being on the run being chased by the devil's henchmen and JB trying to save them all. The fun part is that most of the film has been shot on highways of Europe so we actually see a lot of action packed riding!(The character is called ghost rider after all.... you'd want to see him ride!) This was a fresh take from the first movie where JB was confined to the city. Also what they do is not waste time on the previous storyline. They show flashback scenes in true noir anime graphic novel style which was the second thing that was cool! Also they introduce the demon Zarathos plot line which forms a major part in the GR comics written by Roy Thomas .They should have expanded the story more on this but they don't which is a little disappointing but does give the plot for future sequels. Danny Ketch in the comics is the second GR so he is introduced here as a boy with powers of the devil. Maybe in future sequels we'll see him as GR as well. The new charred burnt skull design they have is also pretty cool. Also there isn't no Roxanne here. As much as I love Eva Mendes she didn't do much to save the first GR so she was not missed here. Well that's all about the fun part ,The bad part is what comes next. The storyline is pretty same old same old you've seen in a lot of movies before. The shaky cameras takes the fun out of the action and all that jazz the other reviews mention. However ,the biggest problem is a lack of a strong antagonist. Yes, there wasn't any one in the movie including the devil himself whom I felt could take on the rider. He was just unstoppable force of nature! They had Blackout who can decay stuff merely by a gentle touch but even he was no match for the rider. I hope Marvel boys take note of this in the future movies if they want them to work. The audience loves broken beat down heroes who rise up when all hope is gone, that some how never happens in SOV which for me was the reason why movie didn't work. To conclude I'd just say this movie was a big improvement over the first one after watching which I never thought there'd be a sequel to it ever. It isn't TDK (hoping most of you know what TDK is!) but then no movie ever will be! If you keep on comparing and expecting every superhero genre movie with TDK well then Marvel movies will never come close...like ever! Marvel always targets the audience primarily the ages of 12-15.(You know people who'd read their comics, watch their movies and buy their action figures and stuff) So I really doubt they'd ever come up with something as dark as TDK. They'll continue with these family friendly hero movies and cash in on them. If you'd like to see the darker sides, nicer story lines better buy the TPB graphic novels and stop running after their movies!",

The FX (flames especially) are better than the first and used brilliantly, and the action is pretty sweet at times!Acting wise, meh... the cast is pretty hit and miss, with the kid actually acting better than Ridiculous Cage. How this man gets these roles is beyond me! And Christopher Lambert isn't far behind...Anyhoo, Ghost Rider: Spirit Of Vengeance gets better.

Took me a while to finally see it and yesterday, i rented it.Now i will say that i don't read the comic, and although the first movie was not stellar, it was a good cheesy fun for me. I really like Nic Cage too as an actor. But the first 2 things i noticed with this movie... they just threw you out in the story like BAM... OK i can live with that, even tough some more background especially on the other characters would had been appreciated. But the second thing... the camera. Its really rare i complain on camera work and the direction, but in this movie i tough it was awful... shaky cams, bad angles, weird specials effects for some scenes.This is more or less what made me think the movie was weird, and although a couple nice scenes where you can see the budget, i was thinking it was a direct to DVD B movie. I didn't watch the first one for a while, i think i will do soon because there some parts of the story that i didn't really get, like they didn't match with the first movie.As for the Rider suit, it was way better in the first movie, sharper, more style, i know what they tried to accomplish with this one, but it came out as not as good as visual look. Also, i didn't got why he had to look at the guys for like 2 minutes before burning them up, it was not that long in the first movie? Anyway Ghost Rider 2 end up being a disappointing sequel to a first movie that was not a masterpiece, but a good cheese fest that i really liked. This one looks cheap, plain an simple, badly film, story is \"you saw it a million time\". I actually liked the Carrigan character tough, i think he was the best part of the movie.",

            "content": "Contrary to popular opinion, I don't think this movie is worse than its predecessor. Only problem is that the movie remains stuck at a B-movie level with just about everything, while the movie was obviously aiming for something way higher.I really don't know what they were thinking with its story. It's not just bad but it's also being incredibly formulaic. Besides, it's a story that feels as if it at first got written for another, different, action-flick, without the character of Ghost Rider in it. This would also explain why Ghost Rider seems hardly to be in this, or at least it feels that way. Only during the movie its action moments, at the start, the middle and the end, Ghost Rider gets featured prominently, while during the rest of the movie he is simply being Johnny Blaze. I don't know, this movie doesn't ever feel enough like a superhero movie. It's really nothing more than a typical B-action flick, with a still slightly above average budget to it.But at least I could understand and follow the story this time around, which is not something I can say about the first \"Ghost Rider\", which I really hated watching. And no, no matter how bad this movie got, I never hated watching this one. It's still somewhat entertaining, if you allow the story to not bother you too much.It still has some good action in it, even while the action isn't always brought to the screen that well. This is really due to some horrendous editing at times. It's really weird but it seemed to me as if they forgot or weren't able to shoot half the footage they needed for its action. It makes some sudden and awkward cuts because of this, which never makes its moments flow very well. A real waste!Visually it's still a fine movie to look at. It has a pleasant style and the special effects are just great. Ghost Rider himself never looked better and more convincing. Too bad he gets sort of wasted in this movie by its disappointing story.And Nicolas Cage always seemed like a perfect choice to play the crazed Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider but after this movie, I'm suddenly not so sure about that anymore. He doesn't know when to hold back and when to go all out with his characters. The movie never finds a right balance between the craziness and intensity of the character and his more human and ordinary side. So perhaps not all of the blame should fall on Nicolas Cage but still I will have no problem with it if his role will be taken over by someone else, in future, coming, Ghost Rider movies.And just like the Ghost Rider character, also the villains had some far more potential in this movie really. They are sort of wasted because they are not getting handled too well in its story. Here we have the devil himself, being played by Ciar\u00e1n Hinds and a person with the power to let everything and everyone that he touches to decay. But both are not being featured prominently enough. During its first half, the Ciar\u00e1n Hinds character doesn't seem important enough yet, while during its second half he suddenly takes up most of the screen time. And the villain played by Johnny Whitworth doesn't even gets his superpowers until half way through the movie. It is the sort of writing like this that lets the movie and its characters come across as sloppy at times and not all that great or interesting enough, to turn this into a good or memorable action-flick.The best character of the movie is still being played by Idris Elba. But where he comes from, what his story is and why and if he really needed to be in this movie, still all remains a big question to me. It says something about the movie as well that he still manages to become the best and most interesting character of the movie, even though you really know nothing about him and won't learn anything about him either.It's a poorly done film, which all can be foremost be brought back to its story. But it's still not THAT bad people. As an action movie, on a B-movie type of level, it's all being maintaining enough and the movie offers some good visuals at times.5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Typically, if critics love it I fall asleep during it. If critics hate it then I always go \"hmmm...\"My only regret is that Marvel and Cage have agreed to part company on the Ghost Rider series.

            "content": "This is a really good movie. It is fun, entertaining, and visually pleasing. The only drawback to it is that the action overshadows the story by a little too much to give it a higher rating. The movie starts out with an intense chase with bullets flying and cars crashing and it never really lets up from there. It could have used a little more down time to build the character of the boy, Danny and explain the growing camaraderie between him and Johnny. That would make us more apt to believe Johnny was able to overcome the nature of the rider to destroy all evil enough to save the boy and his mother in the end. At the apex of the movie is a very long, very fiery battle in mine/construction site/bad guy hangout. The viewer can tell they blew the pyrotechnics budget on this one scene. The problem is there is too much fire, too many explosions, too many bad guys getting burned, too many guns and rockets going off. It quickly becomes too much to focus on and all you can do is sit back glassy eyed and wait for it to come to its conclusion. Fortunately there isn't any dialog during that time to worry about. When I buy this on DVD I can use this scene to go to the bathroom or get coffee without hitting pause. ;-) Central to the plot is the attempt to get the boy to a safe place. Once there we find out in short order that it isn't safe after all. In what is the biggest let down of the movie, there is not enough back story regarding the monks at \"Sanctuary.\" We aren't given enough characterization time to get to know them so that we can feel justified or betrayed when they do what they do. I think the story must have been there at one time and was likely cut to add more action time. That is a sad thing too since the marvelous Christopher Lambert has such a short part. Other than being action heavy, it is a very good movie. Not as good as the first one, but still very good.",

I hate how things seem to change in sequels like an actor switch or something. It didn't have that western feel like the other had. The actor who played the Devil wasn't as intimidating as the one in the first movie. Nicholas Cage as the Ghost Rider/Johnny Blaze still felt the same, but a little less than he was like in the first. The plot kind of felt rushed and was too predictable. It just didn't feel the same as the first movie I saw a few years ago. The action and special effects were what made the movie, and would have probably been even better if I saw it in 3D. I guess this movie will be yet another that is praised for only its effects and not the plot. If I were to rate it, I'd give it a extinguishing 6.5/10.",

This is a good premise as it was in the first one. It's just that the plot moves at a sow pace. It \"seems\" to go fast, but it is really slow and not ahead of its audience. If the story is going to be as such and everyone agrees on this then why not have more of the \"ghost\"? More of the stuff that the title suggests.I have like Cages work in many movies, including Leaving Las Vegas, Moonstruck and Honeymoon in Vegas, but it seems like he was constrained by the parameters of this script in this movie.Directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor with the screenplay by Scott M. Gimple, Seth Hoffman and David S. Goyer (story by David S. Goyer), Ghostwriter: Spirit Of Vengeance maybe had too many drafts and rewrites from too many different sources. Interestingly enough, I look forward to seeing what they do with another installment (if they decide to do one), because the premise is a good one.",

            "content": "I went to see this movie with a friend and he compared it to Ang Lee's Hulk. I'm not sure I can top the accuracy of that as both description and criticism, but here goes. Neveldine and Taylor made one of the most kick ass action flicks I've ever seen in Crank. Everything else of theirs I've watched has stunk out loud and Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance smells just as bad as the rest. This is less a movie and more a collection of special effects shots with a story haltingly bolted together around them. Those effects are better than the original but literally every other single thing about this sequel is inferior to its predecessor. The concept feels like 1970's nostalgia. The plot is a complete mess with long stretches of dead space and an extended climax that gets exponentially more anti-climactic as it goes along. Nicolas Cage's performance is flat when it's supposed to be funny and funny when it's supposed to be threatening. Instead of being a super-hero or even an anti-hero, Ghost Rider is made into a straight up mass murderer. His powers are less defined and the danger he's facing here is substantially reduced from the first film. And Violante Placido isn't nearly as sexed up as Eva Mendes was in the original, where Mendes' cleavage essentially qualified as a supporting actress.Largely abandoning the mythology established in the first movie, this one has the Devil existing on Earth in human form and needing to transfer his essence into his son, which would apparently be a BAD THING. Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage), having retreated to Eastern Europe in his struggle to try and contain his demonic alter-ego, is recruited by a butt-kicking, wine-loving priest (Idris Elba) to save the boy and his mother. Some special effects drenched action eventually leads to the Devil and his son performing synchronized yoga on stage in front of a theater that's only half full of the Devil's minions on Earth. Blaze intervenes, Ghost Rider saves the day and then, after the threat of the Devil transferring himself into his son has been prevented, there's long chase scene that results in the Rider's flames changing from orange to blue, possibly indicating a political shift from leaning Republican to being a staunch Democrat.Were the folks behind Spirit of Vengeance legally prohibited from using any other Marvel Comics' characters or story lines for this movie? Granted, Ghost Rider doesn't exactly have a stellar list of arch-enemies but there are hundreds of decent super-villains in Marvel's intellectual property warehouse and plenty of plots from GR's comics that could have been used instead of some warmed over rehash of The Omen. Frankly, the whole thing felt like some low budget action flick that was supposed to star Idris Elba which got taken over and used as the framework for a big budget super-hero saga.My friend's connection of this to Ang Lee's Hulk is dead on in two ways. Both are largely boring with too many scenes that don't have anything to do with what people want when they go to see a film about a big green monster or a hellspawn biker. And the Hulk and Ghost Rider suffer from the same poor creative choice. They don't talk and that severely limits them on screen. Ol' Jadejaws and Zarathos have clear and defined personalities in the comics. They have goals and desires and agendas and they express them with words and interact with other characters. In cinema, they've been treated as nothing but special effects. They're cool to look at but impossible to connect with and unable to drive the story or relate to anyone else on screen. If you think the audience can accept a living skeleton that's bathed in perpetual flame and wearing motorcycle leathers, why would you balk at letting him speak?Cage's manic overacting is amusing at times, though I don't think it was really meant to be, and the CGI effects are less garish and more realistic than before. In every other aspect of storytelling, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance sucks. Go watch the first one again or, even better, see Crank if you haven't already. Don't bother with Crank 2, though, or anything else Neveldine and Taylor have done or apparently ever will do.",

He needs to help Moreau protect a boy named Danny whom demon Roarke (Ciar\u00e1n Hinds) has plans for.Nicolas Cage looks disinterested when he's in the movie. Either that or he looks like he's on drugs. When Ghost Rider is in the movie, the CGI does better acting than Cage. That's somewhat sad. Some of it is actually cheese worthy.The action is reasonable.

I'm beginning to agree with the Angry Video Game Nerd when he reviewed Indiana Jones 4, the B-movie is dieing. Not because of bad films, but because audiences now-a-days are so black and white. It's got to be a good intelligent film that's on the quality of The Dark Knight or it's a piece of crap.Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance from the beginning isn't trying to be anything more than harmless turn off your brain entertainment and it succeeded in doing so. Honestly what did people expect? It's from the guys who made Crank 1 and 2.Let's look at the good and bad of this film.THE GOOD Every action scene is entertaining and fun to watch. The Ghost Rider is a lot more scarier in this film and is portrayed as quite a freighting being. Big improvement over the first film. The villains also put up a bigger fight in this film.The special effects are also a huge improvement. Ghost Rider's charred skull and melting leather jacket is a huge improvement over the kinky spiked leather jacket, and fake CGI looking skull from the first film.Nick Cage hams it up big for this film, but the directors at least know how to make it work...somewhat....Instead of being Throw up in your mouth bad, it's just eye rolling bad. Honestly though, only two scenes made me roll my eyes and both are when Johnny Cage is trying to hold back from turning into the ghost rider.Idris Elba tries so hard to make this a better movie. He's probably the only actor who actually tried his hardest and his character is probably the most interesting of the side characters.THE BAD While Idris Elba tries so hard to save this film, and Nick Cage is at least entertaining to laugh at in some scenes. The other actors are just....meh. Johnny Whitworth was decent but he didn't have a lot to do other than be the jerky bad guy. The kid and mother are stock characters at best. I'm getting kinda tired of the Devil always being portrayed as some kinda business man. So basically Nothing really good, but nothing really terrible. I just wish the characters were more interesting.Not much plot.While Nick Cage is somewhat entertaining, I still wish they went the full reboot route like The Incredible Hulk and hire a different actor. Someone who would have tried a bit harder like Idris Elba did with his role. In fact Johnny Whitworth would have made a more interesting Johnny Blaze than Blackout.The film is what it is and what it is...is mindless entertainment. It's a b-movie popcorn film and nothing more. It's not trying to win any awards it just wants to be fun and entertaining. I was having fun watching it with my friends and I was entertained...so....mission accomplished.",

            "content": "I have to disagree with the majority of the mainstream critics. This movie is a darker, grittier film than the original and has a better look , as well as superior villains. Also, despite only having roughly half the budget the film makers had the first time, the \"Crank\" team somehow made Ghost Rider:Spirit of Vengeance visually much more impressive. As to Cage, I'm convinced that this time out he's deliberately playing to that part of the audience watching the film in the hopes of experiencing his patented over the top, bats*it insane persona. He doesn't disappoint. Actually, the performances are generally better all around this time (no Eva Mendez, thank God).Where the film works best is in it's relentless intensity. After sketching out the skeleton(pun intended) of a plot on which to later hang the more eye popping visual effects, this flick shifts into overdrive and essentially becomes a superhero variation on The Road Warrior- once Blaze meets the woman and her child , they hit the road and that's where they remain for the majority of the film.To be fair, the trailers for this movie pretty much sum up what you can expect going in, so any complaints seem somewhat ridiculous. The movie delivers exactly what it promises.. a feature length adrenaline rush punctuated by some truly off the hook action sequences. In the process it improves on its' predecessor. It may not be art, but it's a hell of a lot of fun.I saw the 2D version on a drive-in screen and, honestly, it looked great.The 3D was post converted and, although I'm told it does look good, anyone choosing to skip the surcharge and go for the regular version should be fine.",

            "content": "I just got back from Ghost Rider: Spirit Of Vengeance. Much like the movie, I'll get to the point\u2014 it was badass, but it's definitely not for everyone. It doesn't bother with character development whatsoever, it just gets straight to the story, a story that is simple and straightforward. So throw in some cheese, some action and drug it with crack/cocaine and you have a straightforward, cheesy, awesome action movie.I think one reason people are hating it is because of the expectations they have before seeing the movie. \"Oh, the same guys who directed Crank? It'll be good!\" or \"It has to be better than the first one!\" Before seeing it, drop all expectations. Drop any vision in your head about what the movie should be, because you'll just be disappointed.The movie never really takes itself seriously, at all. That's part of the reason why it's so fun. It's not serious, it's not dark. It's fun. Another reason people seem to dislike it is because they expected a dark, gritty version of Ghost Rider. It's not that at all. Neveldine/Taylor put their own directorial spin on it that gives it that rushed, fast-paced, adrenalin feel that just works so well with Ghost Rider.With the first movie, everyone criticized it for the lack of action and the dragging story. So with Spirit Of Vengeance, they cut out the story and gave you action! So zero character-development, simple story and Ghost Rider kicking bad-guy ass, it's the complete opposite of the first. This script just works with the zany fee. The dialogue is really only used to move the story along and for the characters to blurt out incredibly cheesy one-liners\u2014 something I am a fan of, but I know not everyone is.I honestly can't think of what I didn't like about it, maybe if it was more over-the-top and got an R-rating, but oh well. I saw it for what it was, without judgment or expectation and it was a fun film. Of course, people are not going to like it, the style isn't for everyone. But it fit with me, very well. If you decide to see it, don't expect dark or gritty, don't expect character-development as it just gets right to the point, don't expect anything, really. Just go in and watch what the movie has to offer.Oh, and as far as the 3D goes, it was okay. It definitely added a level of depth, but it wasn't eye-popping or anything like that. I do think the 3D might have affected my judgment, only because seeing things with even a slight amount of depth really puts me into it. But I saw it in 3D because it was only $0.75 extra, so if that happens for you, I would take it. Otherwise, just stick with 2D.As a movie complete with character-development, full story and serious script, it probably gets a 4/10. On an entertainment scale, it's a good 7/10. I really liked it, I would recommend it, but I know many won't like it. It's incredibly grindhouse, cheesy and action-y.",

Sure the effects are limited . I actually like the ghost Rider look in this over the original film but the darkness effect of Roarke in his demon form is weak and I think filmmakers went overboard with the 3D effects But as for the feel of the film i think they got it about right - Ghost rider was an odd, dark and twisted comic book . It was unlike the other Marvel series where light and dark was easy to distinguish and the good guys always prosper - in Ghost Rider it was about vengeance not justice and as long as the evil got punished there was no care for anyone else... and that was what they were trying to get at in Ghost Riders depiction ....As a stand alone film - even as a sequel it does a poor job of story telling, but if you go into this knowing something about the characters as a comic book fan then you are not going to be disappointed ...",

At least Roarke's defeat was funny!8)The plot was weak at times.Overall the film is kinda a guilty pleasure for me. I felt it was more entertaining than the first one, though I feel that more effort was put into the first one.

The camera shot was amazing, Nicolas Cage's acting was at its best. The movie really shows that he cannot control the Rider inside him, and when its unleashed! Its mayhem! No body can stop him, even the devil himself. The recap of the story its very well said. This is not a direct squeal to the first one. But half squeal, the movie shows the rider is dark and not friendly. The way he fights is totally crazy. He fights more like a devil than human like in the first movie. The Red One Camera looks great. A treat for the eyes, then the cheeky-type of humor in it was good to laugh at also. Even though the characters does not have much development, the feeling was not there.. It was missing something, but when Blaze turns into the rider everything changes. Especially the sound given by the bike or something before he arrives was totally epic. This Ghost Rider is something I did not expect, a story to be told differently to show that there is good in the rider. You will see what will happen in the movie if you watch. Even the devil will say to Blaze, this is the worst contract that I made. The devil, rider all are shown like real life like. That the move in the form of human rather than just disappearing away. Blaze wants to be a free man, the drunken monk wants to save the world from devil. The mom wants to save her son. So All you need is action from the first scene. Personally I loved this film, I even went to change into a rider my self after watching this movie. But just that I can't do it. If you looking for craziness, abit of humor and great camera work this is the movie you should watch. Critics are gonna hate this movie. But people like me love it! So I am giving it 10/10",

Though yes, Idris Elba is also a welcome addition, but the script doesn't give him much to work with.The biggest problem is the writing. The story doesn't make any sense at all, to call the characters cardboard cutouts would be an insult to cardboard in general, the action scenes are laughably lacking in quality and as a whole it doesn't even seem to take place in the same universe as the previous one.

Also the frantic approach ruined the visual experience for me abit. I know this was made by the crazies that made Statham's Crank (which i liked) but here that frenzied style just didn't suit Ghost Rider in my opinion. That being said, this sequel is watchable & it's straight into the action was welcomed as it wasn't hindered by the usual tragic & often boring Origin story, here Ghost Rider was just let loose & that was a good thing, its just the film wasn't that good or interesting. The villains were bad & i preferred those in the first film but i did like the always decent Idris Elba. The gypsy lady was sexy as hell but the little devil boy was terrible. So yeah it's a watchable film but not one that's particularly special or even that good.I still like that underrated popcorn blast of the first film even though that's still not perfect but it's fun.",

Like the old Indian saying \"If you chase two rabbits you'll lose them both\"The franchise would have benefited if they chose ONE of the stories to tell, ONE of the Ghost Riders to portray. Pick Blaze, pick Ketch, it wouldn't have mattered, but two characters as fundamentally different as they are, dealing with two completely different demons meshing them together just loses focus on the story.And beyond that, what you have left is too much CGI.It could have been a much better film if it chose a direction.

(It also might be good to point out that I love Nic Cage and enjoy the semi-constant character he plays in all movies)The story is a bit choppy, but overall it's a highly entertaining, exciting, enjoyable movie to see (especially in 3D)! Lots of action, great graphics in the fight scenes and some fairly exciting high-paced chase scenes. I also think people over look just how well Cage played the role of Blaze in this film - when he starts to go crazy, he goes frigging crazy!If you're looking for an Oscar-worthy movie, this is not your cup of tea, but if you're looking for a way to be highly entertained for an hour and a half, you need to see this movie.",

Remember \"Black Swan\" in that part where the choreographer played by Vincent Cassel's keeps pushing Nina's harder and harder in her training telling she must spin faster? In the end she achieved perfection with all the obsessive training she was put on but her fate was ultimately horrible. But what does an Oscar winning film has to do with the \"Ghost Rider\" sequel? The faster and faster technique seems to be perfectly applied in this film except that in the end there's no perfection waiting for us on the horizon. Everything's so fast you can't see a damn thing (not even Johnny Blaze's transformation, no longer visible!), you can't understand and follow anything after an hour or so. Has to be one of the most ridiculous and embarrassing sequels ever made, and a huge disappointment considering how great and surprisingly effective the first installment was.The problems started with the format given to this, drastically changed to a somewhat darker and less humored version where the most complicated aspect of it in its first half is dealing with Nicolas Cage's rage while playing Blaze, with comical moments allegedly meant to be taken seriously when he threats the life of everyone on his way, remind us of his strange character shifts from flicks like \"Bad Lieutenant\" (different but good) or \"The Vampire's Kiss\" (awful). He just looks on drugs, heavy ones. Oh, his mission? Revolves about finding a mother and his son who happens to be the devil's son (Peter Fonda's out, Ciar\u00e1n Hinds gets the role). There's some complications and the rest is obvious, a difficult mission ahead and a dreadful experience to be seen. It almost fools us in being good bad movie for the first hour, accomplishes with some fun moments in that time, and there's good presences of guys like Idris Elba and Hinds playing a good villain but it falters, dwells and fails with some ridiculous endless scenes, ugly as hell while surrounded with hurtful CGI ruining everything around. Maybe \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" achieved some perfection with all the hurried scenes and effects: in being a perfect way to waste money, time and energy, and being a lousy script. That's how a movie dies while achieving \"perfection\". 3/10",

This can be achieved even in the most awful of films, as I even managed to get enjoyment out of such train wrecks as Sharktopus and Tommy Wiseau's infamous classic, The Room. Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, on the other hand, is the worst kind of movie to me; it's not that it's terrible, it's just..... bad. I had absolutely no reaction after coming out of the theater. The closest thing to an emotion I felt was the regret of wasting 12 dollars on it (I had missed the 2D viewing because of a miscommunication with my brother) They had tried to stay truer to the source material this time, but when your predecessor has already retcon'd your story to hell, there's no point. the jokes were just lame, and it seems that the new makers (who unsurprisingly worked on Crank) read the comics, but didn't watch the first movie. I went into this theater expecting a typical Nic Cage film, and even by those standards I was underwhelmed. He felt like he was only in, say, 2 minutes of the movie even though he was clearly in nearly every scene. Even the special effects seemed, off, with the rider's head jerking about every time he tried to move. it was clear that they tried to fix what was wrong wit the first movie, but all in all, it was just..... bad",

The best moments are Cage's 'holding back' the soul-sucking demon within, and I was laughing my head off. There is a better Devil (Irish actor Ciaran Hinds is a fine replacement for stiff Peter Fonda)and a nice cameo by Christopher Lambert as a tattoo headed monk. The road smash-up finale is terrific!

The whole story of Ghost Rider could be turned into a very human one, which the first movie tried and failed to do. No this movie goes in the totally opposite direction. They cut out all the fat of human drama and replace it with what you would actually go see a movie based on Ghost Rider for. Ridiculous, over the top action. Who better to do this than the directors of Crank? And sure enough, the movie plays out exactly like Crank. It basically has the pace of a video game. It cuts away from the action for no more than 10-15 minutes at a time. But that brings me to something that disappointed me, Ghost Rider could easily be turned into an R rated movie. I'm sure there was pressure on them by Marvel to really keep it at PG-13 and had they been left to their own devices, we would've ended up with a way more gruesome and over the top Ghost Rider. Also, in a strange way I have to commend Nicholas Cage's performance. 90% of the time, it's just a godawful, phoned in performance. But if there's one thing Nick Cage is really good at, it's acting like he's losing his f**king mind. These turn out to be really funny moments. Dare I say that there are even some clever parts in this movie. Most of these involve the movie kind of acknowledging the fact that it's not a good movie. This is all kind of part of the movie's attitude. This is really just a consciously bad movie. And really, that's sort of the only way I see a Ghost Rider movie coming out halfway decent. Making it as batsh*t crazy as possible. They pretty much did that here and it worked out. I wouldn't blame anyone for passing this movie up, but if you're in the mood for a B-movie, this'll do.",

I don't think that you could have asked for a more random group of people. As the credits rolled, the murmuring that began echoed my own thoughts. \"What the hell was that?\" I enjoyed the first Ghost Rider and thought that it stood on it's own. It didn't need the license behind it for you to understand or keep you in the seat. The sequel leaned HEAVY on the fact that you had seen the previous one and were able to understand Johnny Blaze's predicament. Very little character development on what had happened since we left, and what he'd been through. The new people that are introduced have a wisp of back story. There is so much emphasis on the action that the plot and dialog are left standing in the dust. Rather than give a blow by blow explanation, I'll say this; the few parts of the movie that were received as I think they were intended had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. The few funny parts are the worst offenders. They were literally just asides to the audience, a wink if you will. If you're looking for some action-oriented entertainment and able to overlook plot and dialog, I think you'll like it. There's a lot of well choreographed fights, and the visual effects are really good. I will say that the flame is the best I have ever seen. You'll chuckle a few times (flamethrower) and you'll root for the good guys. IMO, wait though. Don't see it in 3D (WASTE of time and money, added nothing at all) and wait for the BluRay or stream.",

Nick Cage acted pretty well in it, though, but the other actors weren't much to watch, except for the black guy who appears in the first scene (dont know his name). In the end, no amount of great acting could have saved this crap. Again I wish I could get that 2 hours back from my life.

            "content": "I was so sad about the result of this movie. It seemed to have so much going for it. It was built off a classically crappy predecessor so it would look good by comparison even if it wasn't all that great, they brought in 2 really unique directors who one would think they would bring a different kind of spin to the genre and an actor that was really committed to making a great movie and an accurate representation of a character they loved. It should have worked... woulda, coulda, shoulda.If you were able to catch this movie's \"wonderful\" predecessor, Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) is a former stunt rider, doing all manner of dangerous stunts but he made a deal with the devil that has come to human form as a man named Roarke (Ciaran Hinds), to save his father's life. In return he had to give the devil his soul and become the Ghost Rider. The Ghost Rider is a demon charged to punish sinners, no matter what they did and no matter how brutal the manner of the disposal is. He got a raw deal as the devil killed his father the next day via a different cause and Johnny was cursed to endure as the Ghost Rider for the remainder of his days. Johnny has gone into self imposed exile to try and control his burden.Now if you're like me, you look at the summary I've posted above, and you might realize; there's not a lot there. That's where the problems lie in this movie, there isn't the necessary material to go on here. The plot just keeps jumping all over the place, not maintaining the story, the character development or even the tone. It can't maintain any sense of consistency. I really think that the script was the problem here. The dialogue is really bad; it seems almost comedic, in a terrible sort of way. There is one good action scene but even that's odd, the rest of the fighting or car chases are pretty boring. The whole movie seems like it's going for the whole so bad its good feel but at the same time, there are certain scenes where it's trying to be serious. If the goal was the tipping point between utter terribleness and wonderful camp than they certainly did achieve it. But I can't see someone throwing this kind of money at a property like that. Even the jokes weren't funny. They use the typical one liners but they aren't even satisfied with that, they start to rely on one word punch lines with no setup at the end of the film.While I mentioned that the movie seems to be played up for comedy in an effort to ease the awkwardness of it, I do have to give credit to Nicolas Cage for being 100% committed to this role. He really threw himself into this and as corny as it sounds, I could tell that he was really excited about the project. I think the material let him down, that and Neveldine and Taylor's schizophrenic filmmaking. The rest of the actors weren't very good but it wasn't so much them, it was their characters. I really like Idris Elba, he's been really good in everything I've seen him in but for a drunk monk, he's not interesting here. Ciaran Hinds is a good actor and he's entertaining as the devil at first but then the movie undercuts him completely. Johnny Whitworth was good in Limitless but he plays maybe the most uninteresting character here. As Ray Carrigan he was fine but when he later becomes Blackout, he just stares into the abyss like he froze. Lastly, I though the kid actor Fergus Riordan was pretty bad. He's really wooden and there's nothing to him for being the possible vessel for the devil.What saves this movie from being really terrible though is Nicolas Cage's performance and that the concession that the movie does boast some really good CGI. It's easily a vast improvement over the first Ghost Rider and the character looks really cool. It lends to the action too, the scene you see in the trailer where he turns the crane into a hellish vehicle is pretty impressive just because of the CGI. In fairness to the directing team, in some scenes Neveldine and Taylor's camera work does add a little, it gives the film a similar edge that they used in Crank so well. They also bring in some cool animation in a couple of sequences. Visually, I thought they absolutely nailed it.I kept trying to give this movie more credit than it deserved. 2 solid aspects can save a movie but it just wasn't enough here. The script deserves the blame, I think this was a project where they brought in the right people to act, film and do the CGI but the script needed to be punched up a lot, some punch up work on the dialogue would have gone a long way, let alone creating an interesting story. Those who defend this would say I'm not taking the movie for what it is, but I tried to meet it on every level, and I really was disappointed. I did enjoy this movie better than the first Ghost Rider but by the end it's a big hot mess. I would give it a 4/10 just for the sheer insanity of it but I would not recommend it.",

I thought this movie might be bearable because the first one wasn't too bad but boy was I wrong. It was absolutely terrible. I was forced to give it a 1 (and I never rate things a 1) because he is so much better than this and it broke my heart to see him sink so low.By the end of the movie I still didn't really know what the movie was about. It's like listening to a politician's speech who dances around the issue so much, avoiding answering anything that by the end you have no idea what they actually said. (Note: I don't think all politician's are boring just a select few. Every country has at least one who never seems to answer anything yet talks endlessly).I will continue to remain hopeful though that Nicolas Cage can return to his former glory.

            "content": "I want to start by saying that GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE, sequel to the 2007 snore-fest from Mark Steven Johnson, isn't that bad. It doesn't quite qualify as good either, so I suppose you consider it a guilty pleasure on my part. It still may not have all the elements to make a truly great Ghost Rider movie, but I felt it did enough to show we're moving in the right direction after the last one. There are still improvements to be made, first and foremost being a return of the rights to Marvel's production studio, but there was enough here for me to enjoy. SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE is directed by the team of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, the men behind the cult favorite Crank movies. The movie begins some undetermined amount of time after the first film, with Johnny Blaze hiding out in Eastern Europe as he tries to suppress the Rider. Meanwhile, the devil walks the Earth in the form of Roarke (Ciar\u00e1n Hinds) in search of his son. Years before, the devil made a deal with a woman to save her life if she gave birth to his son. Now he's come to collect in hopes of transferring his essence into the boy and becoming impossibly powerful in his earthly form. Blaze is approached by the drunken priest Moreau to aid him in protecting the boy from Roarke until the prophetic night passes. In order to keep the boy safe from the devil and his minions, he will need to become the Ghost Rider.All of the elements are here to create an awesome Ghost Rider movie. The directors of the Crank movies are the perfect fit, and the movie has taken a darker turn compared to the last film. The Rider is designed better and the effects don't come off as cheesy, and the trailer raised my hopes pretty high. And here is where the problem lies: if you've watched the trailer for this movie, you've already seen the best scenes the movie has to offer. What a disappointment. There's only two or three good action scenes in the movie with Ghost Rider, and a lot of his coolest moments are thrown right out there in the marketing. Which brings up my biggest complaint\u0085this movie needed more Ghost Rider! Nic Cage's crazy-face is fun and all, but when I watch a Ghost Rider movie I want a lot of action with skullhead. The story in this movie isn't anything special; it's nothing we haven't seen before. So the only thing that's really going to make this movie work is the action and characters. To be fair, the action sequences we do get are pretty wicked. There's an awesome scene toward the middle of the movie where Ghost Rider confronts Carrigan (Roarke's merc) in a quarry and the Rider jumps behind the wheel of a giant rock-carver. As cool as it is when the Rider mounts his Hellcycle, just imagine the same effect on a giant piece of construction equipment.The movie has a tendency to drag on horribly between action sequences, with only Nic Cage going nuts to keep us entertained. And Cage reaches a whole new level of WTF/insane in SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE. Seriously, just check out any scene where he's trying to keep the Rider from emerging. You'll die laughing. He and Johnny Whitworth (as Carrigan/Blackout) seem to be the only ones in the movie to realize just how absurd the whole thing is and take it to the extreme with their over-the-top performances. Most others in the movie take it seriously, and a serious tone isn't what this movie needed. It needs utter insanity and crazy action, of which we get just enough of each to keep this movie from being unbearable. There's been some pretty harsh criticism of the movie since it was released but I urge comic fans to at least give it a chance. A masterpiece, it isn't. But it's a step in the right direction. Neveldine/Taylor were an inspired casting choice with their trademark frenetic energy a great fit for the source material. Visually, the movie was spot-on with its dark, brooding atmosphere. But the movie pulls all its punches to achieve that dreaded PG-13 when there was so much potential for a good horror/action movie. The next Ghost Rider film, if we're lucky enough to get a third attempt, needs to either be a serious horror/action, or campy grindhouse but it shouldn't aim to mix them because then we get mediocre fare like this.",

A good action scene starring Idris Elba and a great joke, filled with sarcasm and which serves as a warning from the Rider to unwary spectators, cheering up. Only it stops there. The sequences with the Rider themselves disappoint, the story leaves good stretches without convincing explanations and the special effects are banal. Result: the film never takes off. The hope always remains that the next one will be the big scene of the protagonist, who never comes. The feeling of disappointment is inevitable.The story presented does not help either. For fans of the character in the comics, the boy Danny's presence suggested a possible connection with Danny Ketch, the 2nd Ghost Rider. Ledo mistake. Johnny Blaze continues as the flaming hero, now wrapped in a religious background plot that can free him from the curse he bears once and for all. Everything blah blah blah to justify a film that, in the end, does not change the main character's chronology at all.Ghost Rider - Spirit of Vengeance is a weak film, whose great sin was having abandoned the sarcasm that makes it so much fun in the first 10 minutes. The trash side comes up once and for all in the surreal scene in which Nicolas Cage fights with himself to prevent the Rider from appearing. As a curiosity is the participation of the missing Christopher Lambert, the eternal Highlander, so dressed up that it is even difficult to identify him.I liked this site review AdoroCinemaFilm seen on the 28th to the 29th of October 2020.",

The otherwise simple plot becomes a task and even a bore to follow due to the bad editing and pace of the story. Things that are supposed to hit home through a joke, or a \"Wow!\" action scene, fail to do so either because you've gotten lost in all the distractions the film throws at you, or you just merely lost interest due to the lackluster story telling.It's quite a shame in my opinion that there were many scenes that were supposed to evoke emotion, that just did not. It's hard to comprehend how these scenes fail, when in the back of your head, you actually know that in another occasion, that scene should've been really bad-ass, or really funny. Better editing and better character development would've made the movie easier to follow, and would've given meaning to all the great visuals and occasional funniness the film has.Now how does it compare to the first? Dare I say Apples and Oranges? The first was coherent and easy to understand but way too cheesy and campy (lacked action too), while this one was heavy and slow with a lot of zany visuals and camera work. Both seem to want to achieve completely different results from an audience that it's actually difficult to say which one's better.If you're looking for great eye-candy, and whack visuals, then Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance delivers.

And the way it began I was even convinced that it's gonna be better. Turns out this one is even worse.You gotta give them this one - the CGI flame on Ghost Rider now looks a lot more believable. But the VFX of anything else is terrible. Occasionally the movie uses weird emboss and black-and-white effect as if it's a Bollywood movie. It seemed as though the editors had just got After Effects and they wanted to add every effect they could find.The story has no connection with the first film whatsoever. They even get the recap wrong! It shows that Johnny fell to the Devil's feet and cut his finger intentionally to sign the contract, while in reality the Devil had come to his tent when he was repairing his bike, and his finger accidentally got cut and the blood fell on the contract. The setting also doesn't make any sense. Johnny moved to Middle East because he didn't want to hurt anyone. But that's literally what he does there also. And in spite of being set in Middle East they don't show anything related to Middle East throughout the movie.The acting continues to hold the same momentum as the prequel, by which I mean the same campy overacting. At least this time Johnny doesn't point at people and say \"You!\". Instead in the end he said \"Hell yes.\" after pushing the Devil back in hell.I'm really grateful that this series didn't have a third movie. Ghost Rider needs to be a grim, gritty movie with a lot of violence and heavy metal music, not this campy film series. Because no matter what you say, I can never take Nicolas Cage seriously. He's a fusion of Govinda and Uday Chopra. And I can't consider that to be the demon hunting Ghost Rider.",

Being a fan of the books, I caught on to a lot of their ideas that the directors more or less stole from the mid to late 90s comics, and even a little from the mid 2000s. The first and most obvious change from the original movie is Ghost Rider's appearance. The directors turned his skeleton black and made his skull a little more narrow and taller than what would be normal. The Hero also sported simple leather jacket rather than the shiny, spiky jacket that he wore in the first film which would look better on Micheal Jackson. All this made the hero look more hardcore and awesome. The directing style was something that isn't always my favorite, but suited this film well. There was a lot of camera shaking but not too much like in many Micheal Bay films. I didn't appreciate a lot of the references to pop culture that the movie had, but it wasn't all bad. The acting was surprisingly good. Not extraordinary, but better than I expected. And the fight scenes were plentiful and long (unlike the first one). The first film seemed to be liked by most people who didn't read the comics, but was hated by comic lovers. This film I imagine will be the opposite. I loved it but most of my friends thought otherwise. It's something to watch, but will probably only be cherished by a few, including me.",

            "content": "Turkey is the word that I associate closely with whenever any of Nicholas Cage's recent movies come to my mind. Having said that, I never thought Ghostrider-Spirit of Vengeance will be this bad, more so because Ghostrider, the concept, though preposterous, is so so so very cool. An angel of death with a flaming skull riding a hellfire spewing bike is so outlandish, that this is a flick for which you want to just leave your brains outside, forget you are grown ups, and giggle like kids. Sadly, this one is plain, simple bad, and to drive in the point, gets shot in Turkey as well.There is a reason this movie was not previewed for critics- Everything in the movie was sour- for starters, the plot which conflicts with the end of the 2007 movie, in addition to being riddled with potholes, and inconsistently paced too. Johnny Blaze, after his tussle with the devil in the first movie, is maintaining a low profile somewhere in Eastern Europe. He is drawn out by a religious sect to help find out and protect a boy who is sought by the devil, who wants to attain human form and rule the world. There seems to be no God, and the only thing that stands between the devil taking over the world is Johnny. In turn Johnny is offered eternal freedom from his curse, which is contrary to how it ended in the first movie, where he refused to let go of his powers. In his quest, he is helped by Idris Alba, playing Moreau, an agent of the sect who wants to protect the child and the beautiful Violante Placido, who plays the child's mother. In the course of the movie, we find that nobody knows the limits of the Ghostrider's powers, not even the director who kept increasing/decreasing them as it pleases. Sometimes a grenade is good enough to knock him out of action, and sometimes a surface to air missile isn't.The second is direction- the duo of Neveldine/Taylor may have made successful pop art flicks like Crank and Gamer but with a more mainstream subject and with added supernatural flavor that would allow for massive experimentation, they still failed to induce their brand of adrenalin fueled entertainment in this one. This one is clearly not aimed at the masses, but for the director duo's own cult following. As a result, the movie is a mix of cool action sequences and uncool everything else, dialogs that only serve as punch-lines, and lackluster 3D effects. I might be whining about the effects in this one as I saw the trailer of Wrath of Titans just before this movie started, and boy it looked awesome.The third is, of course- the acting. Everybody does an excellent job sleepwalking through their roles, am sure the directors removed the snores in the post production editing- Nicholas Cage today will do anything for money, time and again he proves, and here he plays crazy most of the time, and I guess laughs at the audience a lot for having got them inside the theater in the first place. Ciaran Hinds is so not fearsome, he will not make even a baby pee in his pants- damning for a devil, and after Thor, Marvel successfully hands out Idris Alba a raw deal again- an actor so brilliant as him deserves more than just being a supporting cast in a B-grade movie. The good bits are but few- the locales are impressive, the action sequences are way better than the first movie, the soundtrack is superb, and when evil henchmen quake in fear, there seems to be justice done to the Ghostrider's awesomeness. However, trying to find any more positives would just be an exercise in futility.I barely found the 2007 movie watchable, but this one does not even fall in the \"so bad its funny\" category. It takes an essentially bizarre franchise, and instead of trying to stick to the original comic book plots, it makes it serious. No one seemed to have fun- both who made this movie, and those who watched this. And yet Ghostrider, with his penchant for chains, hellfire and bikes, his penance gaze, his battles with demons and other supernatural beings, and in this movie, a villain with comparable powers- deserved so much better. I love Ghostrider, but this movie is blasphemous to his eccentricity. I finish penning this with a heart and immense sadness. I wont forgive myself for watching this, and putting my loved ones through this wringer.5/10 out of respect for the Ghostrider- after all, I can't live in fear ;)",

But i hated how GR was just like fooling around in the 1st scene. Why didn't he just kill everyone! No stand there and make a joke and see what people do. He spent like 2mins doing his Penance stare to one guy and then eventually got 4 rockets up his butt and then the bad guys took took the kid. But was really bad was the ending! Don't even start. GR is killing the rest of the bad guys and then flips the car (like u see in trailer) then takes the devil and puts him back too hell then. Grabs the kid and takes him to the mom. (Be aware when u see him standing with the kid in his arms (its the 1st Ghost Rider!! LOOK at his clothing and head!!) Then johnny saves him and says yes....hell yes! then its like the last one GR he rides off but this time it was blue fire then at the end \"Im Ghost Rider\" Then credits. I don't hope they make a 3rd one because this wasn't the greatest BUT I will buy this on Blu ray and 3D for the sound and action and bass.",

The single worst thing is that they never said what happened to the his lover from the first film, and the actor who played the devil sucked monkey butt. So 7.5 out of 10 is my score, and if you can put that past your mind. Its great I really wish they used Peter Fonda as the devil.",

            "review_title": "Look! He Can Pee Fire!",
            "content": "We have already learned that Johnny Blaze (Nicholas Cage) sold his soul to the Devil to become the Ghost Rider, a demonic bounty hunter who takes on the appearance of a flaming skeleton in a leather jacket. He rides a motorcycle, also flaming, and carries with him a chain which he uses as a weapon. About midway through \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,\" we learn that his powers extend beyond even this \u2013 according to what he tells a young boy, at least. It seems that, when he has to pee, he unzips his fly and lets loose a steady stream of fire, like a flamethrower. All of a sudden, I understand the euphemistic meaning of the word \"fireman.\" Never mind the fact that, as a skeleton, the Ghost Rider would lack the equipment necessary to produce a stream of any kind. Of course, this is not the kind of movie that bothers to think along such lines.I was not a fan of 2007's comic book adaptation \"Ghost Rider,\" although I would happily sit through it a second time if it meant never again having to see the sequel. On so many levels, \"Spirit of Vengeance\" is painfully bad. It tells a story that doesn't even try to make sense. Cage gives what will undoubtedly be regarded as his worst performance, and his costars don't fare much better. No one is helped by dialogue so excruciatingly juvenile, it's as if the screenplay was written by fifteen-year-olds with short attention spans. The story and some of the screen writing credit is given to David S. Goyer, who can no longer coast by on his involvement with \"The Dark Knight.\" With films like \"The Invisible,\" \"Jumper,\" and \"The Unborn\" all under his belt, he has officially disappointed me one too many times.On top of everything, the film in no way benefits from its over-hyped 3D effects. We're not immersed, and we can barely make out that something is flying off the screen \u2013 or even that the person standing closer to the camera has more definition than the person standing further away. It didn't help that the picture was so unpleasantly dim; day scenes looked like they took place at dusk, and night scenes were barely visible. Even the title's characters blazing skull, which I naturally expected to look bright and glowing, was a murky ball of dirty yellow flames. I would normally recommend you save the extra money and opt for a 2D projection, but in this particular case, I recommend you save your money entirely and not see the movie at all. Dimension (or lack thereof) is only part of what makes it so bad.Since the events of the first film, Blaze has left the United States and is hiding out in a remote part of Eastern Europe. He broods over his curse, in which he turns into the Ghost Rider in the presence of evil and feeds on souls. He's sought out by his friend, Moreau (Idris Elba), a member of secretive church sect. If I'm remembering correctly, his job was to protect a boy named Danny (Fergus Riordan) and his mother, Nadya (Violante Placido), as it seems Danny is somehow involved in some kind of satanic conspiracy. But Moreau failed; both Danny and Nadya have been kidnapped by a group of mercenaries led by Nadya's former lover, Ray (Johnny Whitworth). He's now in league with the Devil in human form, named Roarke (Ciar\u00e1n Hinds, replacing Peter Fonda), who wants the boy for his own evil purposes.The connections are a bit arbitrary and rather confusing. It seems that, like Blaze, Nadya made a pact with the Devil \u2013 only in her case, she was pregnant at the time. Is Danny the Devil's son? Narrative logistics would make this impossible, unless I'm forgetting something important, which is quite possible given how hard it was for me to follow the story. We do know that Danny will gain hellish superpowers when he comes of age and goes through a ritual, the time of which is rapidly approaching. Hence, all the chasing across the back roads of Europe and the Middle East. Whatever the specifics, Moreau wants Blaze and his demonic other half to find mother and son and protect them. In return, Blaze is promised a way for his curse to be lifted.At Roarke's behest, Ray is transformed into a supernatural being with the ability to make things decay simply by touching them. This does allow for one amusing scene in which he tries to eat someone's lunch; after picking up a sandwich and an apple and watching both disintegrate into nothing, he grabs hold of a Twinkie, which remains intact. A cute moment, however, doesn't excuse the delivery of lines that wouldn't pass muster in a raunchy teen comedy. This goes double for Cage, maybe even triple. There's a scene early on in which Blaze confronts a sleazy club owner while trying his hardest to keep the Ghost Rider under control; Cage's lines, coupled with his goofy style of verbal and physical convulsing, make for one of the most embarrassing performances he has ever given. He has made his share of bad movies over the last few years, but \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" is going to be a tough one to live down.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",

They turned it darker and grittier than the first one, which a movie like this should be; stepping it up from the first one. The movies opening where they give the viewers a briefing on how Johnny Blaze became Ghost Rider was cool. The final battle sequence was well done. The visual effects and Ghost Rider's new \"look\" have been much improved. But, everything in the middle was mediocre at best. The first two \"battles\" were incredibly weak. They had a lot of missed opportunities. They could have done so much with them. Instead, he quickly whips them with his chain and they burst to flames and they're dead in literally, 2 seconds. And instead of showing the audience that the souls are actually being sucked out of their bodies, he stairs at them for 10 minutes, which slows down the pace of the movie. I was expecting something along the lines of him blowing fire out of his hands or mouth at his opponents, but they only do this once. Also, the camera angles are annoying as they show titled and crookedly filmed shots that make the movie resemble something out of a cheap cop show. The movie is an odd mix. They had a good direction where to go with it, but the script was weak. They could have shown a lot more of Ghost Rider's powers, other than just whipping them with his chain, and then their dead.",

It's been a while since catching Cage in the original 2007 \"Ghost Rider\" picture, but my recollection is that the film makers did a better job in that one with the CGI work. Here the special effects ranged from pretty good to cheesy, especially whenever the Ghost Rider in full flame zeroed in on his enemies with the burning skull. Then he just looked hokey. I don't know why it struck me so funny, but when Carrigan (Johnny Whitworth), in his demon form, disintegrated a sandwich and a piece of fruit with his newly acquired demonic touch, a Hostess Twinkie was spared the same fate.

The action was great and the portrayal of the Ghost Rider was refreshingly psychotic... Third, the plot had more depth than the first. It wasn't anything intricate but it was definitely a step up. My honest evaluation of this film is that it will keep you interested the whole way through and that psycho devil version of Ghost Rider will captivate you. It might not be completely on par with the comics but it's really cool. And for all those people who said there was too much smoke.... shut up. It was awesome. Your just mad that your little boy version of Ghost Rider is outdated and you can't bring back your inner child and boohoo. This look was gritty and dark and I liked it. This was not meant to be a classic portrayal of your childhood super hero. This was a film meant to take you on wild thrill ride while looking through the eyes of a crazed demon....",

            "content": "Arriving roughly 5 years after the release of the first film, the world's (supposed) darkest hero returns to ride his fiery, black-smoke-emitting, polluting motorbike in his classy black leather jacket, Gothic boots, and fiery skull for a head. While \"Spirit of Vengeance\" is supposedly the sequel to the 2007 hit film, the story lines developed in the first film don't continue in this \"sequel\" and some are contradictory: Johnny Blaze insists he keeps his powers in the first film, while in the second film, he desperately searches for any possible attempt to eradicate his cursed powers. See what I mean?\"Spirit of Vengeance\" begins with an attack in a random temple somewhere in Eastern Europe by some thugs. It turns out they're after some random boy who is valuable to the devil. One of the survivors of the attack, Moreau meets Johnny Blaze (aka Ghost Rider) and offers him a deal; if he is able to fetch the boy from the hands of the thugs, his cursed powers will be lifted from him. The fiery rider accepts the deal and begins his quest to retrieve the boy in an attempt to have his powers removed.If you've watched the first film, you'll see that in the end, Johnny Blaze refuses to return his powers and insists he keeps it. Therefore, we can infer that he wants the powers. But here, he's a different person. He apparently doesn't like his powers, loathes them and is in a desperate quest to find and search for ways to have his powers removed. And what happened to the other girl from the first film, that girl named Roxanne? No trace of her at all. Did the writers even watch the first film before scripting this film.Instead of setting things right, \"Spirit of Vengeance\" descends from its serious nature from the first film into a goofy, joke tone in this film. Even though the first film was disappointing, it had a serious tone and therefore, had the intention of trying to be a great film. This atrocious sequel discards all the serious intentions developed in the first film and became a terrible, joke film that makes it look as if there was no intention of making this film excellent. It appears that there was never any intention of setting things right and correcting all the flaws in the first film in this potential sequel. And what's up with these fast-forward effects. Every now and then, there has to be some fast-forward effects that are really annoying. They make the film look as if it was cheaply made.The bad guy here is a thug in the first 45 minutes or so. He's working for the devil and is hired to retrieve the boy. But then after being thrown by Ghost Rider 500 meters in the air and crashing with a gigantic slab of rock resting on his torso (who doesn't immediately die under these circumstances) without a single trace of injury, he is given a second chance by the devil and is given the powers of decay that makes him have white hair and a disgusting face. The 3D. What 3D? There was not a single conspicuous sign that the film was shot in 3D. The artificial depth was hardly noticeable and I regret watching this in 3D. There was almost certainly no 3D at all. So anyone planning on watching this, please reject the 3D version.\"Spirit of Vengeance\" is completely terrible. The 3D here is basically 2D but darker and blurrier which is why we are required to use the 3D glasses. The plot is atrocious and this film makes the first film look like \"The Dark Knight\" or \"Batman Begins\". This is way worse than the first film and definitely not a \"sequel\" to the original 2007 film. The film would have gotten a 1 but I'll give an extra 2 for great special effects.Final Verdict: \"Spirit of Vengeance\" is an atrocious \"supposed\" sequel to the already disappointing original \"Ghost Rider\" film.Rating: 3/10",

            "content": "In an opening that just barely sets up the thin excuse for a plot, we are treated to cybermonks(the Nostalgia Critic must be on top of the world) and one of those action scenes(nearly all of which in this are unexciting(with the exception of a too short battle near the end) and only there for the reasonably well-done FX(which are at least less stiff and goofy than in the original, a film that this one, by the way, screws over(...I guess we can't completely hold that against it) in a couple of ways, retconning away some of the few things that weren't negative)) that are confusing in inverse proportion to how enjoyable it is, and since nothing has been established yet, we have no clue who to root for and no reason to care. Actually, it never really produces last-mentioned. Anyway, the titular Ghost Rider has gotten to look(they took a step away from the old skull in this... not that this isn't plenty full of other silly stuff) and behave bad-ass since the ending of the 2007 one, and that provides a little entertainment in an otherwise dismal flick. He's hired by a drunk French priest to protect a woman and her 13-year-old son, since the devil has a vested interest in the latter. They're chased by Carrigan, the gunrunning drug pusher insert other Hollywood bad guy clich\u00e9s, who has a bunch of hired goons around to shoot at stuff, and, more importantly, fill the role of cannon fodder for our dark hero. Yes, that problem with him remains, he has too little opposition and tends to win with ease(this time, turning plenty of people into ash, by merely touching them), and though they do try to throw some challenges his way(in the form of explosive-based weaponry, if it is inconsistent how effective it is), it again renders those sequences tensionless. The 3D is hardly utilized, except for a cheesy opening gag of threatening the audience... like every other joke in this, it fails completely. A bunch of the time, that has more to do with the dire execution than the material that, at times, shows genuine promise(such as the example of the Twinkie bit). This tries to go into a compelling thematic, with Cage(who delivers a decent performance, as, unfortunately, the only one in the cast in this... Ciar\u00e1n I know to be skilled, and like Peter Fonda, he has the gravitas to portray Satan, and I wish he'd brought it here... to be fair, part of the blame lies with the tired, uninspired script of insipid dialog and characters that, like everything else in this, are devoid of memorable qualities) being possessed by an avenging angel, and his struggle to control it. It also asks an ethical question or two. Wouldn't it be fantastic if either of those things had us engaged? I can't put my finger on why they don't, but I can't deny that to be the result. When looking this up here, I learned that it was only 90-ish minutes. That caught me off guard. It felt like at least two hours. The flamethrower penis joke is as gratuitous as you might think or worse. This holds nothing worth the price of admission. Yes, this is a Neveldine-Taylor picture, and you can tell from the style, when they choose to apply it. We get a little surrealism, and at times this feels like they're desperately trying to turn it into Crank 3(a series that was actually well-done), with Nicolas stealing pain pills and coming off like an addict during an interrogation as he tries to hold back the physical transformation. It doesn't help that they're forced to fit their work within the constraints of the PG-13 rating. I'm also not convinced that these two should ever go near fantasy again. This doesn't even have that much of the supernatural in it, and the only villain who uses powers makes things decay... you know, just like Blackheart did in the Mark Steven Johnson take on this(at least it's treated to better animation). There is a lot of disturbing content, a little implied sexuality and barely any moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to those who won't heed the warning. 3/10",

They changed his jacket to what looked like char, which was far less impressive than the original jacket. His new bike also failed to impress and was far more lame. Oh, and I love the \"magical\" chain that comes out of nowhere and extends to infinite lengths whenever he wants. Yea, where does he store this chain, nowhere on his body (like the first one) just in some undisclosed location at his side where it can grow to infinity and beyond. I think he just keeps a single link in his pocket.They completely disregarded the original storyline, yea his dad was dying of cancer. But I don't recall his dad being at piece with it, after all, he hadn't even told his son (in the original). Not to mention the flashbacks they showed portrayed a whole different appearance. And that's not even counting the disregard for his (at the very least) semblance of control he gained at the end of the first movie. And the fact that he no longer wanted to get rid of the Ghost Rider (the devil offered to release him and he refused), which this movie ignored. Oh, and Johnny no longer made a deal with Mephistopheles, apparently it was Roarke. I understand that the Devil goes by many names, but you would think Johnny would still remember the Devil by the name given, instead of randomly coming up with a new name for the Devil.Oh, and my favorite part, the change in personality of the Ghost Rider. Instead of the cool, determined, almost judge-like style of the first movie, let's just make him the Joker! (yes, as in from Batman) Psychotic, sadistic, cuckoo for cocoa puffs, half the time he looked like he was jacked up on drugs whenever he was entering his Ghost Rider form. It was so very cheesy.But the worst part was his powers. His gaze power no longer exists as far as I'm concerned. He just looks intently at people before turning them to ash. Which is his other power, a simple touch turns enemies to ash. You see it frequently where all he does is backhand them and enemies vanish. It's anybody's guess as to why the movie took so long. I mean the only reason he lost the boy in the first place was because he spent half the first fight standing around looking at people. So scary. Plus, he can poof all over the place (darn prohibited words!). He just kind of darts back and forth across the battle field, like he's a lamer version of Nightcrawler (from X-men). Half the movie he had no significant enemies. And when he finally gets one (some decay guy) the enemy dies in such an unsatisfying way (run over by a car). Even the devil himself doesn't even pose a challenge. The Ghost Rider has a brief starring contest (in which the Devil appears terrified) then his magic chain throws him in the air and slams him back to hell. OOH, So impressive.All in all, I am impressed that someone could take a great movie like Ghost Rider (the original) and turn it into the crap that is Ghost Rider 2.",

Despite the very tight budget, the directors managed to pull off dramatic and much improved visuals over the first film.

It's dirtier, darker and more sadistic which creates a much better atmosphere when trying to bring this comic book to the big screen. The movie contains quite a bit of mindless and cheesy humour which it gets criticized for, but those with such criticisms seem to forget in the process that it's based on a comic book that was targeted at teenage boys. Granted the writing could have been better, the story could have had more depth, and you could have probably done a few more takes of certain scenes... but considering what they had to work with and how much time they had to make this movie, it's actually not as bad as some people make it out to be.

Whenever Nic Cage's character Johnny Blaze transforms into the rider, Cage does his old bit again, fidgeting, losing his cool, about to implode, nobody does it better than Cage but at the same time, because of that, you can't take him seriously, Blaze/Rider is supposed to be menacing, not making you laugh and on top of that, the movie is riddled with one joke after another that bombs, you're left wondering which idiotic self-proclaimed comedian wrote this piece of sh*t. A colossal disaster, that's how I'd describe GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE. If you take each part separately, each would look badass as a single footage or as collection of clips but you put them together, you'll see how unorganized, how much of a mess it actually is.As I said earlier the 3D FX is actually fun, there's a scene in which the Rider supposedly broke the fourth wall and talked to the audience, his eye sockets suddenly lit up like a pair of headlights, for that one split second, the movie looked decent. So visually, I think Neveldine/Taylor's team managed to make things look mental, as if the movie wanted to become part of the audience as well, but the story doesn't offer the same excitement. For some reason, I don't know why but there's that John Connor-Terminator relationship that they're trying to copy by having Blaze connect with the kid, Danny, but it just doesn't work. And it's one of those stories where the superhero willingly loses his power only to eventually realize that the only way out is for him to regain the very thing he once thought was a curse. But by the time the overpreachy Moreau (Idris Elba) convinced Blaze of the possibility to be normal again, I'd already lost interest. The movie frequently takes unnecessary breaks and irritating stops along the way to forcefully educate you about the mythology, the devil, and how the rules work, through flashes of archive footage or crazy animation that aims to brainwash you ala Clockwork Orange. I guess the movie moves in the same manner as Nick Cage when he starts to lose his cool. Restless, on edge, any minute now it could get harmful and you know that you just have to best stay away from the movie because it won't do you or anybody any good.-- www.Ramascreen.com --",

            "content": "It really makes me sad to think of where Nicolas Cage's career has gone. At once a great actor who put actual thought into the movies he did, now he stoops to anything. I kind of enjoyed his 2011 film Drive Angry, because it was dumb fun and it knew it. But before that he did Season of the Witch, a travesty from anyone's standards.This year he has brought us another pile of garbage, called Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, but i'm going to call it Ghost Rider 2, because that's what it deserves. The first movie was OK, it was a little hokey but I accept it. But the sequel, which is directed by the demons who brought us 2009's annihilation, Gamer, is the slowest ninety minutes i've ever spent.The plot is incomprehensible. Johnny Blaze(Cage) has run off to Europe for some reason, and ends up getting mixed in this ordeal involving a little boy and the devil(Ciaran Hinds, who looks like he's having a hard time keeping his eyes open he's so bored). Idris Elba also stars, giving a ridiculous accent, as a character who doesn't serve any purpose what so ever.The film is boring, dull, stupid, and hilarious, and poorly acted to top it off. The weird old people from Being John Malkovich need to leave John Malkovich alone and take over Nicolas Cage. Cage's performance is so over-the-top it's painful. The moments when he transforms into the Ghost Rider are... well, I don't know. They're disturbing, and it's not the content, it's the acting.Never give a sequel over to the directors of Gamer. I didn't realize it was possible for two people to screw up a movie, but these guys are like film terrorists. I don't know who they are, I don't want to know who they are, and I hope I never meet them. Ghost Rider 2 is painfully bad. My stomach is hurting just thinking about it.D",

I felt like I was watching a STV quality film. The actors were all terrible including Cage who acts like a mental patient for 90% of the film. The 3D in the film is just horrible and probably the worst 3D I have ever seen. It was clearly converted post production and it shows. The depth is lacking and the pop out effects are non-existent. The 3D makes this movie even worse than it is. I would avoid this movie at all costs. I am glad it performed poorly at the box office so they never have to make another Ghost Rider film ever again.",

Nicolas cage was the shining performance. who gave more of a physcopath side than the last one. and you see Nicolas cage in the theaters every month now, in fact next month he has a new movie called seeking justice coming out. and it seems Nicolas cage cant get a big crowd in anymore because of his choice in roles, and people i think are getting sick of him being in theaters every 5 seconds.but he was good in this, and brought some real acting to the role. but cage always does good in his films, but some of his films aren't good, and one performance is not going to save it. and it seems cage flips with his movies since 2007. he has a good one, then bad, then good, then bad. this one was OK. not great, not better than the first, not the best reviewed film of the year, but still a movie worth seeing, on DVD. wait for it on DVD.just came out in theaters yesterday. in theaters, don't see it. on DVD. see it.",

This supposedly to avert the anger within from reappearing, thus keeping the monster in check (wait? I thought this was \"Ghost Rider\", not \"The Hulk\"?). Nonetheless evil has a funny way of globalizing itself, like through humping Gypsies in order to deliver a future avatar for the human form of Mephistopheles, or Roarke (Ciar\u00e1n Hinds) as he is known to his contractor Blaze. Why the Gypsy Nadya (Violante Placido) would endeavour to sign a contract to hand over her only son Danny (Fergus Riordan) in exchange for being devil-humped is never satisfyingly revealed. Nonetheless trigger-happy drunkard monk (WTH?) Moreau (Idris Elba) approaches Johnny with a hope that he will turn out to become the innocent boys saviour before Roarke transfers his soul. To do this they must find Ray Carrigan (Johnny Whitworth), a mercenary who is keeping the boy captive.Directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor must be congratulated for achieving no mean feat: turning one of the most hellish dark Marvel characters into a goofy fire-peeing prank. Utilizing an overload of jump-cuts and video-styled narrative comes a cacophony of noisy sequences, which build neither dramaturgy, action tension or the slightest bit of interest. Nicholas Cage meanwhile does not fail to disappoint, thus proving any unbelievers that the franchise has no future until the Rider dons his face. The problem doesn't limit itself to acting when in the Johnny Blaze persona, but carries over to the Ghost Rider, which posturing and movement is awkwardly jittery. Given the absolute lack of narrative flow none of the actors get handed an easy job, so even Idris Elba and Johnny Whitworth manage only to keep some semblance of pride from their portrayals. All in all miraculously \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" is even more camp, but with a side helping of disembowelled story.",

The movie takes no time to get the audience involved in what is happening and plunges it right into action. 2.) Next to not being involved in what is happening, you also will also be nauseated by the action, as it is a rumble-fest of shaky cam. What ever happened to picking a nice angle, sticking with it, and give the audience a chance to take in what is happening? 3.) The saturation of this movie was leaning a lot on the cold side - which is an odd, not the say - THE - wrong choice in a movie that is all about fire.Then: the good stuff: 1.) Great humorous bits throughout the movie 2.) The scene in which the Carrigan 'character' is on the phone with the Roarke 'character' is cinematically done BEAUTIFUL. Maybe even a bit over the top, but it was the best live-action scene in the movie. Period. 3.) The animated bits. They were so good, the movie would have been better if it was all animated like that. Huh, it might have even gotten the art-house-status instead of the cult-status if they did.All in all: the good and the bad even each other out.

There's absolutely nothing bad to say about it. Only there's nothing good to say about it either.

            "content": "Continuity. It may just be the most valuable asset to a franchise. In fact, it's the only quality that a sequel should uphold. Whether the films be a couple of years apart or even a decade, they *should* resemble some sort of common ground. Aside from the titular anti-hero making his demonic presence for a grand total of five minutes, Spirit of Vengeance is essentially a vehicle for Cage to activate full \"Cage Rage\". Despite how gloriously atrocious those scenes were, it wasn't enough to change my overall opinion. And that is, Spirit of Vengeance is the worst superhero film I've seen. Blaze is tasked with saving a young boy from the Devil, who wants to shift all of his demonic powers onto him.This sequel has a reputation. Released during phase one of Marvel's cinematic conception of their shared universe (although not associated with it whatsoever), this is a prime example of a studio not knowing what to do with their intellectual property and pumping out a sequel for the sake of nothing more than to earn some quick bucks. There's no creativity involved. There's no effort. Only an uninspired reason for a studio to keep a property. And y'know what? It's dreadful. Both the film and its existential purpose.It commences with a stylised comic book aesthetic which offers unnecessary backstory in case any viewers hadn't watched the awful predecessor, recreating scenes that didn't actually happen in the first place (i.e. signing the soul deal). Strike one! Then we're introduced to a plethora of characters whom I can't remember the name of (that were *that* memorable), to which they all emanated no sense of characterisation and only splurged excessive exposition for the sake of moving the generic storyline along with no real innovation. We meet up with Johnny Blaze again and it seems his alter-ego can now ride the fires of hell in daylight, despite explicitly stating that he must remain in the shadows. Strike two!Once all the handheld shaky cam, frequent rewind clips and desecrated set pieces are out of the way (absurd creative choices to say the least...), Blaze apparently decided he no longer desired the Rider within him. Yet again, despite stating to the Devil in the first film that \"it's a curse I will use to destroy you\", and so half of the film felt more like 'Nicolas Cage: Spirits of \"How'd it get burnt!?\"'. Strike three! The blatant aesthetic change from cheesy comic book adaptation to grungy alternative sequel resulted in several traits no longer existing. It was like a child growing up listening to The Spice Girls, now choosing to hear the screams of Marilyn Manson. The witty one liners were absent, no mention of the supporting characters including the romance with Mendes and the visual effects were somehow worse, the entire film resembling fan-made Adobe illustrator rubbish. Strike four and five!The acting was woeful, with Cage and Elba hamming up their performances to maximum velocity. Hinds, the new Devil replacement, was grossly misused that it made me feel gross just watching him sway his body round like he is in the middle of a yoga session. Blacked out action sequences? Decaying glass but hardly anything else that was touched? Abrupt conclusion? No. I'm done.This isn't a sequel. It's a reboot disguised as a successor. And I cannot get onboard. The overly gritty style accompanying Goyer's dreadful story was enough to make my head spontaneously combust. Continuity is everything, and this had nothing. Spirit of Vengeance? Don't you worry, I'll be taking my vengeance by burning this film.",

He's a possessed stunt biker. 3- The movie was inspired by one specific Ghost Rider comic series: The Road To Damnation. It's dark and crazy.That being said, this movie lives up to my expectations. It doesn't have an eye-catching plot or relatable characters. The acting isn't award-winning, either. But it entertains. And it's fun. I honestly had a smile on my face half the time. The whole thing is just crazy! And the directors were going for a more realistic look with GR's overall look. This is why his skull is charred, the smoke is everywhere, and the jacket is burnt and bubbling. And it gives him a cool edge. The actual demon's backstory is explained more, which is a plus. And the demon acts... Strange, to say the least. Without spoiling too much, he seems to enjoy toying with victims before he sucks out they're souls. And he'll eat anyone's souls. Even if the worst you've ever done is pirate a song, he'll get anyone who's sinned. Which makes him seem more dangerous.The bad things about this movie: It's too short. There could be a bit more action. And some of the special effects were kinda... Out of place. And the movie wasn't R-rated, like it's meant to be. The movie still isn't for everyone. But overall, the movie was entertaining. I give it an 8/10. I recommend not seeing the 3-D like I did.

Nicholas Cage's acting as Ghost Rider is very good and you really get a feel for the struggle he has within between himself and the rider.This movie focuses on the new human vessel for the devil, a small boy named Danny who is in fact half devil himself. During the movie Johnny Blaze is trying to get rid of the rider and in the process finds absolution for his sins as well as a new reason to continue with the help of a new friends Nadya and Moreau. This movie also gets more into the origins of the rider and where it came from.One thing that stood out to me was having a villain with a bit more purpose and character than seen in the last film. Ray, your typical criminal scum is trying to bring Roarke (the devil) the child he needs to continue taking a human form. Along the way the devil grants him an interesting power of decay and from there he becomes the central antagonist to Ghost Rider along with Roarke.Bottom line, the thing that makes Ghost Rider great is Johnny Blaze's struggle for redemption, and using a twisted evil power in spite of itself for good. This movie shows both of these elements very well, (even better than the first movie in my opinion)and the final result is a good action movie with a solid focus and direction.I highly recommend Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance to any Ghost Rider fan, and to those who enjoy a good comic book adaptation. 9/10",

Basically it has been five years since Johnny Blaze (Razzie nominated Nicolas Cage) made a deal with the Devil, in the guise of Mephistopheles, now Roarke (Ciar\u00e1n Hinds), and was cursed to transform into the demonic bounty hunter Ghost Rider, he is now on the run to avoid causing anybody any harm for their sins and crimes. In Eastern Europe, Johnny is approached by French priest Moreau (Idris Elba), he explains that mercenary Ray Carrigan (Johnny Whitworth) attacked a fortress protected by monks, and abducted young boy Danny (Fergus Riordan), but his mother Nadya (Violante Placido) rescued him, they escaped with Moreau on his motorcycle. Moreau offers Johnny to restore his soul and remove the Ghost Rider's curse forever, if he protects Danny from Roarke, who has plans for him, to help him take human form. Of course this will not be easy for Johnny, even as the Rider, as Ray has a powerful weapon that can subdue him, and he is trying to resist becoming the Rider when confronted by sinners, but he seeks vengeance against Anthony Head as Benedict and Vincent Regan as Toma Nikasevic. Cage is still sort of alright as the anti-hero, despite still having slightly unconvincing flames and skull effects, the rest of the CGI effects are fairly good, there are some chase and fight sequences that get your attention, but just like the predecessor it is overall not a very thrilling action fantasy horror.

I would pass on a $1.00 rental on this turd let alone the thought of paying for a blue ray copy. I fought myself not to see this pitiful movie and gave into some internet hype and radio plugs by Nick Cage but I should have went with my gut. There is no story here that is worth seeing, it is as if a 15 year old stoner came up with this plot while slamming Robitussin with his drop out buddies. This is the worst movie of 2012 so far and I pray it is the worst that I pay to see in the theater for the rest of the year.

            "content": "This is the apotheosis of a hit and miss movie. There are as many things wrong with it as there are right.The most disturbing factor in the movie is Nicholas Cage's acting. He doesn't even appear to be playing himself (as is the case with most of his movies). For the entire movie, you get the feeling he would rather be elsewhere as his performance appears lackadaisical. There's no conveyance of any character and no chemistry between Cage / Johnny Blaze and any of the others involved.Then there are the soul-taking sequences. These are way too long. By the time the Ghost Rider starts to pull out a soul and actually remove it from its body completely, the bad guys have enough time to, get in their vehicles and drive to the nearest army base... overthrow the soldiers... hack into the weapons room... decrypt the nuclear missile codes... and launch them at The Rider... as I said, way too long. These scenes verge on the ridiculous and I nearly turned off at this point.Which would have been a shame because I would've missed some of the good things about this movie. The concept of whatever The Rider rides becomes his hell on wheels is inspired as this allows for the transformation of a van and a drilling machine. These are pretty awesome scenes. The last chase scene is pretty decent and packed with action.It was also pretty nice to see Christopher Lambert as the mad monk Methodius.Apart from Nicholas Cage, the rest of the cast were okay. Not outstanding by any means. Though the strongest actor was Idris Elba as Moreau, and even he wasn't at his best. This could have been down to the direction of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, who did a great job of all the action sequences but weren't too hot when handling the acting and there are too many sequences that feel \"thrown in\".If you enjoyed the first Ghost Rider movie or enjoy the Comic Books then you may enjoy this but I would not recommend it to anybody who wasn't a fan of The Ghost Rider.",

            "content": "If you liked the Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance. Don't read any further. If you want to know how I think Spirit of Vengeance destroyed a perfectly good franchise, read on.I don't know if the Ghost Rider movies is true at all to the comic, and for me it doesn't really matter. The movies must be able to stand alone, free of the comic, since a complete translation is never possible anyway. So when the sequel, Spirit of Vengeance, to Ghost Rider begins with not being true to the first movie it destroys its own foundation. If minor details is not carried over it doesn't matter much, but Spirit of Vengeance has very little of Ghost Rider in it. And I must say I liked Ghost Rider. It was tongue in cheek action with a entertaining dialog, creating an air about it that I liked. Spirit of Vengeance has none of it.Directly it shows a completely different way Blaze struck his deal with the devil. Why? It certainly wasn't better, as I liked how the devil tricked Blaze with the deal in the first one. This has no real bearing upon the story, so why not use footage from the first film? The only thing the change accomplishes is ruining the contract between movie and spectator. We now know that the movie doesn't respect its own continuity. It doesn't believe in its own story, so why should I? Actually, it is one of the quickest ways I have seen to kill interest in a sequel. Kudos to the director/writers.Other things they changed that destroys the spirit of the movie is; Blaze's behavior is completely different. In the first one Blaze was very troubled and tested the deal, in this one Cage tries to act Blaze as insane (and fails completely), nervously laughing randomly. The Rider's weapons, motive and character is changed to a more insane monster than a real Spirit of Vengeance which implies that the character has some intent of accomplishing anything. Here the Rider just goes mayhem. And why change the Penance Stare \u2013 that destroys the souls? It was a weapon that made the Rider unique, now he is changed to a walking flame thrower? Why not keep the implication that the Rider is actually created by the devil to hunt souls instead of just being a fire monster? The Rider's motorcycle is changed and I don't see why it need be. It's like changing Iron Man's suit, it was part of his identity. But they haven't kept that either, so why bother. And Peter Fonda's devil was much better, seemed much more devious, plotting and therefore evil than the simpleminded one Ciaran Hinds has to portray.On its own Spirit of Vengeance is a decent, but not good, action. The effects are good but the story is much more unbalanced and, believe it or not, more over the top. The idea seems to be bigger effects is better, let's shoot missiles instead of bullets, let the Rider handle mining equipment instead of his bike. But the story is forgotten and underdeveloped, it seems like a few mystic quasi-religious themes has been thrown together. It is the story that creates the entertainment, with the effects augmenting it. This is something the writers/director seems to have missed, since they have it the other way around. To sum up Spirit of Vengeance would be to way badly over the top. Form effects to Cage's insane acting.The bright spot is Idris Elba as the monk Moreau. Though I missed Sam Elliott, Moreau replaces The Caretaker and Elba does the best of it. There is an intriguing character, a motorcycle riding, weapon wielding alcoholic monk. Why not explore and develop that character more? Unfortunately he is barely used in the movie. A decent writer could perhaps make an effort for a spin-off? One review I read was that they attempted to reboot the franchise since they didn't like the first one (why not?). They failed, what they accomplished was destruction.3/10",

Only the devil being what he is didn't play fair. And now Johnny is cursed with a demon inside him who comes out whenever it sniffs an evil soul which is in need of being reaped. The Ghost Rider is a fiery skeleton who rides a mean-ass fiery motorcycle. When Johnny transforms into the Ghost Rider, he dispatches bad guys with long fiery chains, or by staring deep into their eyes and sucks the soul right out of them.Young Danny (Fergus Riordan) is a 12-year-old boy who is the love child of beautiful Nadya (Violante Placido) and the devil incarnate, Roarke (Ciar\u00e1n Hinds). Roarke is such a powerful demon that he is slowly burning up the human body he inhabits. With Danny's young body built from the stuff of demons, Rourke plans to take it over thus killing Danny and ushering in a new age of hell on earth.However, Johnny's old friend Moreau (Idris Elba), who is friends with a secluded sect of monks, makes a deal with Johnny: Prevent Roarke from making the transfer before Johnny's 13th birthday (a mere 2 days away) and Johnny will be freed from the Ghost Rider. And we're off\u0085This is not my typical movie attraction. I avoided the first Ghost Rider movie (2007) because it sounded ridiculous (a flaming skeleton riding a flaming motorcycle wielding flaming chains of death) - and because it starred my second-least-favorite actor, Nicholas Cage.What attracted me to this sequel was the proposition: A hero who was cursed with an evil demon could redeem himself by saving a young boy from another evil demon. So, we have an anti-hero who has to fight a villain to save mankind. That is a pretty unique hero's journey.I was very concerned that I hadn't seen the first movie. I actually had found the film on Amazon Instant Video and my finger hovered over the \"Purchase with 1-click\" button, but I could not bring myself to purchase the movie. These comic-book-based movies have a lot of backstory and if you don't know where these guys come from, you can be quite lost. But the writers and directors were mindful of folks like me and included a nice prologue with a decent amount of explanation so I knew who everyone was and could follow along. Although the presentation was clumsy, I was very gratified to be \"in the know.\"I've never understood the appeal of Nicholas Cage. He is a very monotone actor with delusions of grandeur. His every performance resembles every other one and he engages in what my sister calls \"bad smell\" acting. When a dramatic moment is needed, he wriggles his face in disgust as though encountering a horrid smell. On the other hand, my daughter liked him in \"National Treasure.\" Cage didn't disappoint. He still smelled a lot of bad things in the air.In the end I was entertained by the story. There were a number of confusing if not ridiculous plot devices. But the amazing motorcycle chase scenes drove the story forward and were worth the price of admission. So, for an entertaining story with great chase scenes but smelling acting, I recommend you wait for the instant download.",

            "content": "We're now more than a decade into the modern superhero movie era, folks. At this point, we've just crossed the threshold of the \"reboot phase,\" in which studios have either been forced or decided to re-imagine some of the 2000's major superhero properties. We saw \"X- Men: First Class\" successfully relaunch the \"X-Men\" franchise last summer and Sony is hoping to do the same in July with \"The Amazing Spider-Man.\" Even the critical and/or financial flops of the 2000s, such as \"Daredevil,\" \"Fantastic Four\" and both \"Hulk\" films have reboots in the planning stages.And then there's \"Ghost Rider.\" After the first film met a rough reception from critics and audiences in 2007 and a few years passed without a sequel, it seemed that the story of demon-possessed daredevil Johnny Blaze would get a full makeover. Apparently not. Five years later we get \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,\" which puts Nicolas Cage in the seat of the Ghost Rider once again, but cleans the slate from the first film aside from a brisk debriefing on how Johnny received his curse. With the directors of \"Crank\" (Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor) assigned to add a boost of adrenaline, this could be considered at least a dedication to improvement, right?Nope. Although the action could be described as better and the visual depiction of the Ghost Rider improved and more fully realized, \"Spirit of Vengeance\" suffers from the same plot inanity as its predecessor, if not worse. It's an exercise in obnoxious filmmaking and warrants a label as the blathering mental patient of all superhero movies.Johnny Blaze is hiding out in Eastern Europe when a wine-slugging frenchman named Moreau (Idris Elba) comes knocking. He offers to rid Johnny of his curse if he'll track down and protect a 13-year-old boy being hunted by the devil (Ciaran Hinds) for a specific purpose. Johnny finds the boy and his protective mother (Violante Placido), who also made a deal with the devil in her life, and you don't need to know anything that happens after that.When there's no movement or kinetic energy to this \"Ghost Rider,\" it falls completely apart. Neveldine and Taylor only seem comfortable when cars go fast, and there's not nearly enough of that in this script. The tone of the rest of the scenes, ones in which conversations and generic character interactions take place is a complete schizophrenic mess. You never know if Cage will deliver a trademark snarky comment or have a psychotic break. I'd say he hasn't been this bad in a long time, but snarky/psychotic is Cage's career in a nutshell.The film possesses that mad-dog insanity of the \"Crank\" franchise, but being outlandish and lacking self-seriousness requires a full commitment. \"Spirit of Vengeance\" tries to be serious on too many occasions that whenever it tries to be crazy nut-job funny, it fails. A scene involving a Twinkie offers the only nugget of humor, but in the context of the film it's completely useless. The dark, rough and devilish vibe of \"Ghost Rider\" does not gel with this sense of humor at all. It could, but the story is so horribly bland that it doesn't matter. Remember that pissing fire scene from the trailer? It makes even less sense in the movie.I will, however, give one ounce of credit to the depiction of the Ghost Rider. In addition to being more grisly and realistic thanks to improved CGI, he's truly menacing. Too bad he doesn't get enough of a spotlight; the real curse is when he turns back into Cage. The idea of Johnny trying to contain the Rider and keeping it from taking over him creates an intriguing \"Incredible Hulk\"-like dynamic that could've worked well in the story, but it only impacts one scene and Cage hams it up so badly that he ruins it.From a pure entertainment standpoint, \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" is only good when it's on wheels, the fleeting moments when the kinetic style of its directors can be effective. Hinds gives a nice performance as a crazy Satan, but the rest of the film fails to commit to the same level of delightful lunacy, and everyone knows you don't go half-lunatic.Fox's blind trust in The Dark Knight co-writer David S. Goyer and the others who helped on this script clearly didn't work out. Keeping the original film's director, Mark Steven Johnson, on as executive producer doesn't make much sense either. Their film comes off as a careless effort meant for nothing but to keep the rights to \"Ghost Rider\" from reverting back to Marvel, where they'd be in much better hands.~Steven CThanks for reading!

And especially the face of the Ghost Rider. Here we do see him change in all kind of forms before the skull appears but it doesn't add anything towards the myth. Even his bike and the chains were different. The story itself had nothing to do with Ghost Rider and didn't pick up the end of the original flick, no one returns even Ghost Rider's love life is gone. The CGI used was okay but the whole thing just didn't work. What I did like was the fact that no shots were made to add towards the 3D by which I mean, if you watch it in 2D you don't see any shots that you might think yep, this is a 3D shot. It worked in 3D but I have seen the Blu Ray and the sound wasn't very clear in the high frequencies. A bit of a miss here, could have been much better if they staid towards the overall look made in part 1. Cage is Cage and again, you love or hate him with his typical voice seen in all his movies.

            "content": "'Ghost Rider: Spirit Of Vengeance (2012)' is so much better than the first one but it's by no means a masterpiece. It does have its moments, though, mainly when it's being balls-out crazy. This doesn't happen quite as often as you'd like but, when it does, it's genuinely entertaining in a 'B-movie' sort of way. Whether or not Neveldine and Taylor intended it to, it feels far more self-aware than this sort of schlocky superhero fare usually is. Therefore, it's far more fun. It's plain goofy and it knows it. It almost feels more like a spoof than a straight-up serious affair, even though it isn't; it's something somewhere in-between. Yet, because its comedic beats seem purposeful, you laugh with it rather than at it. This simple shift makes for a much more enjoyable experience. It's not quite 'so bad, it's good' because it's, seemingly, exactly what the filmmakers intended it to be. Generally, it's a bit of a strange one. It's a sort of 'soft sequel': it loosely follows the first film but it changes a considerable amount of the overall lore, usually for the better. Nick Cage is let loose this time, allowed to go full 'Nick Cage' in a few frankly hilarious scenes. At the same time, he also gives a much more genuine performance, even giving some brief and limited but believable emotion. The rest of the players are all rather good, too. The story is simple but, by the same token, effective. It's by-the-book stuff that doesn't stray too far from the formula but it does a good job of getting you engaged and it even has a couple of character arcs, to boot. The Ghost Rider itself is presented much better than in the first flick, too. It's convincing, in terms of its visual-effects, and comes across as suitably monstrous in a kooky kind of way. Unfortunately, its debut appearance, and some of its subsequent ones, are hampered by the fact that it often just stands around in its so-called fight-scenes, mugging for the camera or performing long 'penance stares' - which take all the pain that a baddie has dealt and fatally deal it back to them - that aren't actually indicated by anything other than the act itself (so, if you haven't seen 'Ghost Rider (2007)', you won't know what's happening). The transformation - or, rather, near-transformation - scenes are things of crazy-eyed beauty, though. Obviously, there are plenty of flaws. The main antagonist - or, I guess, henchman - is a little irritating but also instantly forgettable. Even when he gets the power of 'decay', he's dampened by some dodgy design choices and a general lack of menace. The film en masse makes some strange visual choices; it feels as though the directors got bored watching their second-to-last cut and decided to randomly speed-ramp some segments to pick up the slack. There are, of course, some lapses in logic and a lot of the action, which doesn't occur too frequently, isn't all that satisfying. Plus, the plot is predictable and the ending is super rushed - like, 'almost cut off the final line of narration' rushed. On the whole, however, the flick is far more enjoyable than it ought to be. It's a fast-paced, slightly tongue-in-cheek slice of superhero schlock. It's certainly not good, by any means, but its intermittent entertainment has to count for something. 5/10",

It was mildly entertaining and I had a reasonably enjoyable time watching it. I could brush off the bad and just have fun with it. But this thing? The only positive piece that can be said so far, is the effects for Ghost Rider himself, seem improved. Everything else, from the way it was shot, down to the practically nonexistent script, even to bad Nicholas Cage (there is good, campy Nicholas Cage, and then bad over over the top Cage). I, personally, like the actor... and I like some of his films. I remember him doing at least an OK job in the first film... but here, the acting is so dreadful, melodramatic in the worst ways.I was a pretty big fan of Ghost Rider in the 90s, the Dan Ketch Ghost Rider, not the Johnny Blaze Ghost Rider (in the movie, it's Johnny Blaze, but the Ghost Rider looks ripped from the Dan Ketch Ghost Rider, which is the cooler looking Ghost Rider, anyway). In the 90s series, Johnny Blaze, after ridding the spirit from him, does return to help Dan Ketch deal with the whole mess. But this is the cool, long haired Johnny Blaze. I kind of wish we had that Johnny Blaze. Kind of like a Whistleresque character, which might not be appropriate at this juncture.OK, inconsistencies aside. I can deal with that. But is it too much to ask for them to put the property in the hands of a capable director? Someone with a visual flare and a grasp of action photography? I would love to see a Robert Rodriguez Ghost Rider movie (as long as he's working with a screenwriter who knows the franchise well, because he has a lot of talent and flare, but his scripts tend to have a lot of holes in them).Why is it they give a superhero team I never really cared about to someone like Joss Whedon, someone capable of great work, and yet, stuff like Ghost Rider and Transformers, they hand off to some whack jobs. Thank the heavens that Christopher Nolan, at least, has gotten to make a Batman trilogy. Please, Hollywood, let's stop hiring these retarded directors. And when you give the material to a talented director, let that director work.I think a perfect example of this is Sam Raimi vs Christopher Nolan. Sam Raimi, when allowed to make the film he wanted to make, made Spiderman 2. But then massive studio interference caused him to make Spiderman 3. Yet, Nolan, the studio apparently is letting him make good movies. We'll see if the final Batman delivers on its promise... but I have high hopes on that one. I haven't heard anything equivalent to what was happening to Sam Raimi during his making of Spiderman 3. Put the work in capable hands and let them do their thing.Upon looking up the director... not one, but two guys, who were responsible for Crank. And of course Crank 2. And the dreadful Gamer movie. Now it all makes sense and I have to wonder if anyone at the studio even bothered to try and watch these films. Because, how, on god's green earth, could you think these MTV, all over the place editing, unable to sit still for a moment, directors, could possibly be a good fit for a Ghost Rider movie. How? The virtually nonexistent plot makes sense now. Crank was just run, run run insanity. And it looks like they did the same thing to this Ghost Rider movie.I'm continuing to watch it and all of a sudden, knowing who directed it, everything about the way it's shot, the writing, the acting, it all makes sense now. And that's not to say this is a good thing, as it doesn't make the atrociousness of the film any less atrocious, just that it now makes sense. This is Crank: Spirits of Vengeance.The writers of this movie clearly had no idea as to how Ghost Rider would fight and what his powers should be. There were weird moments where he would stop the fight in the middle, surrounded by bad guys, and stare at a guy for a few minutes. Plus, whoever he touches, just melts away? What? The film is inane. Stupid. A bad director can make good actors look bad and when you have someone as up and down as Nicholas Cage, you really need a good director and material to bring out the best in him.There is absolutely no redeeming value to this film. None. Zippo. No cool moment that stands out, not a single, good action sequence in the lot. Drudgery of the worst kind.If they ever want to try this again... Number 1, hire a good director/writer team, people who takes the time to understand the material. Number 2, just start over with new actors. You can even do the Dan Ketch Ghost Rider, a perfect excuse to never have to revisit the horribleness that was. Number 3, hire a GOOD DIRECTOR.",

            "content": "The hardest thing to accomplish in sitting through this sequel to the 2007 original Ghost Rider is finding one moment that is even remotely engaging without feeling the aggressive urge to doze off and snore. When did a fiery-skulled hero burning through the road on his motorcycle and thrashing the bad guys with his sizzling hot chain stop becoming fun? This movie, replacing the original director Mark Steven Johnson with Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, is a soulless rote that not only makes the unfavorable feat of taking Nicolas Cage and sucking him dry of his charisma, but plunges below the level of its predecessor in more ways than one. The previous film was significantly forgettable, but it shined a few moments of excitement and awe. This film, which continues closely to where the last film left off, is so dry of adrenaline and energy it leaves you questioning of whether the directors had a clue of what they were trying to achieve. For Ghost Rider, a Marvel comics superhero who's reputation is widely overshadowed by the overwhelming popularity of heroes such as Spiderman, Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, and the X-Men team; the movie gives no reasons to believe the hero has a solid future in the celluloid. Nicolas Cage returns as Johnny Blaze, a road-raging motorcyclist who made a deal with the devil that granted him the power to morph into a skeleton with a skull engulfed in flames and wield his metal chain against the baddies. Blaze is appointed by gun-toting priest Moreau (played by Idris Alba) to go after a woman named Nadya (played by Violante Placido) and her young son Danny (played by Fergus Riordan) and protect them from the demon Roarke (played by Ciaran Hinds) who threatens to take on the human form of young Danny and rob him of his soul. It is wildly disconcerting see how dull and empty of adrenaline this film, especially with the directors of the 'Crank' series and the action-packed, yet creatively bankrupt 'Gamer'. Whereas the aforementioned flicks are driven with nearly non-stop action and gun-blazing left and right, this film feels awfully relaxed placid with its action set pieces, while the filmmakers dominate the scenery with demonic supernatural imagery that has been done better in far more superior flicks of the fantasy and horror genre. Whenever there is no action going on, it rushes with its storytelling without giving us a chance to even get engaged with the plot or the characters. When the action is happening, it's dull and lacking of nearly sense of fun. Just when we are getting pumped up with Nicolas Cage morphing into the fiery, chain-wielding monster, the frenzy is greatly diminished by the inconsistent CGI and needlessly frantic camera-work. And it most certainly does not help that Cage is sleepwalking through the role, while Idris Alba is running near empty on charisma. It's as if both of the actors are disinterest in committing themselves to the roles. Well, hey! With a script as lackluster and empty of enchanting the nature of the eponymous hero, who can blame them? Though one give them the directors points for saving the final twenty minutes with an intense, frenetic action fight sequence between the the titular hero and the villain Roarke, it is hard, in the end, to think of a valuable reason why the story should continue. Could they have done justice by handing over the rights to Marvel comics? Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is a dull continuation to the eponymous hero, lacking of palpable adrenaline and shallow of energy to compensate for its lackluster script. The film does no justice for the comic book hero, it only piles up on the abuse the superhero has endured in the celluloid. As for Nicolas Cage, retiring from the role is probably a wholesome choice for his career.",

Ghost Rider 2 has some good CGI and some scenes that make Ghost Rider want it just goes over the top and leaves the movie dull and you just end up checking your watch over and over waiting for it to finish a superhero film for me you should never want it to end. The storyline is OK a little poor but some good humor but a lot has changed and your left feeling you don't even want to remember the movie. The only reason the movie has just got a 5 is the ending it is similar to the first and has everything whats missing from the movie humor from the Ghost Rider and the rubbish CGI has gone. Nick Cage perfect form in the first movie its all gone in this installment. I thought if this film can be similar to the first we are in for a treat instead it kicks off the superhero season with a fizzle and it is just no where near Thor last year who kicked off last years superhero season. With soo many Major superheros coming up The Avengers, The Amazing Spiderman and The Dark Knight Rises they all are going to be better then this I'm afraid to say i enjoy Marvel films and this is the only one i have ever really felt short changed. There is not as much 3D as you would expect either. Ghost Rider 2 should have had a better villain more action and better performances and just been a little less crazy.",

Whosoever was responsible for approving this movie's version of a script, should be fired and black-listed until the Second Coming.The Devil's Second Coming, in essence, is what loosely passes for a \"plot\" in this atrocity. Apparently, the Devil (played by Ciaran Hinds) convinced some random woman, Nadya (the writer's didn't even bother to give her a last name; played by Violante Placido), to conceive his child, later named Danny (again, the writer's didn't see fit to give him a last name either; played by Fergus Riordan). Thirteen years later, the Devil is back, employing the services of Ray Carrigan, a small arms dealer (played by Johnny Whitworth), in order to bring him his \"son\" in order to effect his Second Coming. Somehow, Johnny Blaze (played by Nicolas Cage), who transforms into the Ghost Rider, becomes another one of Danny's protectors, along with Moreau (it seems the writer's didn't bother with too many last names in their script writing; played by Idris Elba).Please see the rest of my review at: http://brensmoviereviews.blogspot.com/ Cheers, Bren",

            "content": "You can practically smell the 'Honest Trailer' brewing: \"Coming to theatres just in time for Valentine's Day: the sequel nobody wanted to the comic book adaptation everyone tried their best to forget about, directed by the two guys critics love to hate, starring a CGI Nicolas Cage with his head on fire.\" What could possibly go wrong? Let's be honest, though \u2013 no one ever expected Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance to be good. Not in the conventional sense, anyway. But lo: for certain more (or less) discerning audiences, their batsh*t senses were tingling. Surely, such a fusion of insane premise (\"Flaming Skull vs. the Antichrist\" is surely the best Roger Corman movie never made) mixed with low expectations, all run through the blender of Nicolas Cage let off his leash into 'sack full of cocaine-ingesting ferrets style crazy-town' couldn't fail at being the big-budget-B-movie- bonanza trip of the year. Surely, although not 'GOOD good', Spirit of Vengeance would at least rattle our eyes out of their sockets in the most deranged, campy, way possible. Right\u0085?Well True Believers, let's just say someone needs to invent a term for having two successive levels of expectations and hopes dashed. (and if you say 'Inception-fail!', it's death by flaming crane for you)The sad truth is that Spirit of Vengeance is kind of boring. It's inevitably too trashy to be taken seriously, yet too inconsistent and periodically somber and posturing to even be properly digested as enjoyable garbage. Initially, it looks like the odd mix between the film's austere, almost Ingmar Bergman-like craggy European settings and lofty spiritual themes shot through the \"let's see how many directions we can move the camera at once without inducing a seizure\" lens of caffeinated hummingbird directors Mark Nevaldine and Brian Taylor (yes, the two who pooped out Crank, among other such dreck) could lend itself to a surreal blurring of high and low culture, like an art gallery explored on roller-skates while on acid. Unfortunately, the final result is too lazy and twitchy (and I'm not even just referring to Cage) to even benefit such lacklustre similes. What we're subjected to is a visually muddy (and blurry \u2013 perhaps Nevaldine/Taylor ingested too many Red Bulls before filming to check if their lenses were focused), obnoxiously blaring mess. Yet somehow, amidst its sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of continuity errors, 8-bit-calibre CGI, and vaguely whimsical conflicts, characters, motivations, and superpowers (Ghost Rider can 'pimp his ride', transforming any vehicle he steps into, be it a hummer or crane, into his Hellmobile? H'okey doke\u0085), Spirit of Vengeance has the gall to attempt to take itself seriously. Apart from the occasional Tarantino-aping anime contextual cut-scenes, the film's only reprieve from Cage's Johnny Blaze's halfhearted brooding (\"d'wanna hurt people!\") and the inane machinations of 'good' and 'bad' Evangelical sects lies in its brief and boring action scenes. Hilariously, as in his first risible ride, Ghost Rider's powers prove too non-visual (he literally stares baddies to death. The metaphor is irresistible) or brief (every enemy touched by his \u2013 teehee \u2013 flaming chain is immediately incinerated) to make for much visual spectacle. The introduction of Johnny Whitworth (who at least has the good sense to appear to be contemptuously laughing throughout) as a satanic thug equipped with the power of rotting everything he touches (again, this film is just asking for it\u0085) is enough to briefly prevent the viewer's eyes from glazing over, but even he is sidelined and reduced to expendable visual effect, just one blip amongst the din of exploding cars and flying Cage spittle. There's the occasional moment where the lunacy button is punched so hard the film briefly flirts with the camp classic it could have been. Cage urinating fire \u2013 a complete non sequitur, to boot \u2013 is probably the highlight, but there's also a bit with a twinkie which is good for a chuckle. Worshippers at the altar of Crazy-Cage should find enough of a fix of snuffling, wheeze-laughing, shouting-every-third-word, drinking-out-of-weird- things, bug-eyed insanity to momentarily tide them over, but are forced to earn their keep by sitting through just as many scenes of pouting, brooding, and asinine expository voice-over (booo). Some may find the film's true pleasure to reside in Idris Elba's DrunkMonk (sorry \u2013 Moreau), who pops by here and there to drop ominous one-liners in his globe-trotting outRAGIAUS acCENTe and challenge Cage to a googly-eyed staring contest. Perhaps, newfound connoisseurs of watching Ciar\u00e1n Hinds' face fall off as he does his best 'scowly Robert De Niro' impression will be born; others can ponder the film's theological continuity \u2013 is he the devil, or isn't he? \u2013 before giving up, and finding a more productive use of their time in smashing a bible into their face repeatedly, a-la Monty Python. Finally, those belligerently attempting to follow plot can sift through the film's gleefully incoherent script and devote energy attempting to care about the aggrieved 'Mom 'n Antichrist on the run' conflict, as an exercise in abject futility. But y'know \u2013 it's your 95 minutes. I'll be over here playing 'pin-the-tattoo-on-Highlander's- face' if you need me.Too stupid to be any good, and too lazy to even aspire to 'so-bad-it's-good', Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, is, in many ways, even less satisfying than many of the most soulless, by-the-numbers Hollywood superhero flicks for refusing to own up to its own silliness. Cage- apostles and avid devotees of trashy action cinema might cough up enough meagre scraps of enjoyment to 'hurr-hurr-hurr' their way through. Otherwise, this is one comic book franchise that should really just heed its own advice and give up the ghost. I mean, let's face it: we're running out of incongruous, over-sized receptacles for Nic Cage to sputter and drink out of for any ill-advised Ghost Rider 3: This Time He Wears a Bear Suit. -3/10",

            "content": "The movie I am now reviewing is called, \"Ghost Rider 2: Spirit of Vengeance,\" and its starring Nicolas Cage, Johnny Whitworth (played in \"Limitless\"), and Idris Elba. This movie came out on February 17, 2012. I actually got the chance to watch this movie in the movie theater. Honestly, I thought the first Ghost Rider movie wasn't bad. Even though a lot of people I talked to really didn't like it. When I saw the previews for this film (Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance). I was thinking to myself, \"I have to see this.\" I thought the first one wasn't bad and it looked like the second coming of the Ghost Rider series was going to be even better.This movie is about a dare devil named Johnny Blaze. Johnny Blaze has made a deal with the Devil, and he is trying to figure out how he can save humanity from the Devil and not kill everyone in the process as he does it.To break this movie down and come up with a couple sentences or a paragraph to describe it was way more difficult for me then it was suppose to be. This movie is a mess! There were just too many things going on that had me confused. I, to a strong degree, almost didn't understand the plot to the movie. Granted I wasn't a big fan of Ghost Rider comics, there may be something's that I need to understand about the Ghost Rider. I don't think all the understanding in the world could have this film. There isn't a \"we are the world\" song we could sing to save this film. This could have been a movie that could have had a basic plot and my have been successful. This movie needed more action! People want to see what the Ghost Rider can do. There were very little action scenes and the one that they gave us wasn't really that great. There's moments in this movie were I'm still trying to figure out what is going on. Then they threw a kid in the mix. Not a good idea to me. Unfortunately, what ended up happening (that I saw coming) was the kid was getting to much attention in the movie. I think I could have come up with a plot better than this and I didn't even read Ghost Rider comics as a kid. It simply sucked and it even sucks more that Nicolas Cage had to be apart of this awfulness. Some things that I did like about the movie (besides the previews) were there were some cool scenes in the movie. Seeing Ghost rider on fire and a chain rapidly coming out of his mouth was awesome. There was one scene in the movie that I liked and thought was funny. It was the scene when Johnny Blaze was trying to get some guy in the hospital to corporate. Being though he was Johnny Blaze just started going crazy and transforming back and forth between Ghost Rider and himself. I also thought some of the camera views were nice. You could tell the director put a lot of work into that. My final rating for this movie is going to be a 4 out of 10. This is an extremely low rating for me. Its very rare I rate movies this low. That should tell you something right there. Don't see this movie on anything. If your super curious or a big Ghost Rider fan than you have my blessing to catch this on Netflix, or borrow it from one of your friends. That's if your friends collect enough nerve to purchase it.",

Yes they delivered on action and their were moments of intrigue. Nic Cage's performance was top notch, but everybody else's was weak sauce. The script was weak and muddled. For some reason the two most bad ass characters in Marvel's Pantheon (Ghost Rider) and (The Punisher) keep getting poor adaptations. Also the old adage of never work with children is not always correct ( hence the films of Truffaut) but as far as action super hero movies go, it is. The whole anti-Christ story fell flat because of (and this sounds mean, but it is true) the kid's performance. Please stop trying to lighten up kick ass characters stories with stupid family oriented story lines, it never helps. I would not recommend this movie to any fans of the character or even fans of the directors. Unless their is a directors cut out their that is better like in the case of the Daredevil movie.

Perhaps because no-one actually knew what to do with the character once his origins had been explained. A lot of the potential had been squandered in the original, the horror aspect was underplayed and Nicholas Cage was miscast in the lead. He's too old for starters. I suspect that if Cage wasn't so desperate for cash at the moment, 'Ghost Rider Spirit Of Vengeance' would have been a straight to DVD release with a different actor as Blaze/The Rider. It was made on the cheap in Eastern Europe, most of the budget being spent on the CGI for The Rider (an improvement on the first outing) and lamely post rendering the whole thing into money grubbing 3D. Cage doesn't even seem to be even trying, if anything he appears to be having a contest with John Whitworth (Carrigan) as to who can be the worst actor. The plot is half baked and it's obvious no real effort was put into the screenplay. Ciaran Hinds makes an O.K. Roarke (aka Satan) but he can only work with the rubbish material he's given. Not enough screen time is given to The Rider - Blaze in human form hogs the limelight, possibly due to financial constraints. Comic book adaptations need to be made by folk who understand the material they're working with. The team behind Ghost Rider clearly don't have a clue. Marvel should have been slower to release the rights rather than jump at the cheque waved under their noses.",

It was easy to tell that they did, they have a specific style that I enjoy. As for the rest of the movie I thought it was laughably bad. The effects were OK but Cage is so over-the-top in this that it almost feels like he's mocking himself. I know movies like this aren't watched for the acting, but when it's this bad it's too distracting to not notice. All that said it you liked the first one then you will probably also like this one. I didn't like either but that's because I don't like Cage. This movie is just a little above \"Drive Angry\" in quality.

After the movie, he told me he did not like it. I loved this movie. It was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I'm sure it was not supposed to be funny, but i do not care.

            "content": "Initial Review: To me, the Ghost Rider character has so much potential. He offers something that very few other Marvel characters can provide: a more sinister tone. Ghost Rider is more of an anti-hero than anything else, which makes him stand out from others. From what I understand, the first \"Rider\" had mostly negative reviews, but still spawned a sequel. I personally thought the first film was mediocre, and was really anticipating the sequel to step up its game. I have very strong mixed feelings about this movie which I will address further in this review.The Positives: The first thing that stood out to me was the change of appearance for the protagonist, Ghost Rider. His skull looks much less animated than the first, and at times gives of a smoke that clouds his body and really gives him a darker tone. The film provides some decent action scenes which I believe was an improvement from the last film. I also felt that there was a better story line than the last Ghost Rider.The Negatives: I had many issues with this film starting with the acting. Not only did the film have a less prestigious cast than the last film, but I believe every actor in the movie overacted throughout the film, including Nicholas Cage. Changing direction with the cast, the flick lost consistency when they changed actors for the main antagonist. The Devil, played by Ciaran Hinds, paled to his predecessor (Peter Fonda) with massive amounts of over-acting and terrible facial expressions that really annoyed me. The movie also lacked back story for the new characters they introduced. The flow of the movie really felt off to me, and felt like a low budget movie.The Conclusion: I gave this movie 5/10 due to disappointing acting and consistency. By no means is this the worst Marvel movie I've seen, but it lacked the quality to keep the audience interested throughout. I don't know if I would recommend this movie to anyone, but if you are a comic book fan, I think this a movie to see. This movie, released in 2011, has not seen a sequel since burning the franchise.",

It seemed cheap compared to last, Johnny Blaze in the first film had character, angst and excuse the pun some fire about him! All of these were lacking in this film.

It couldn't choose which incarnation it wanted to be and flopped hard for lack of decisiveness.I rented the sequel out of loyalty to the character even though I expected a disaster.I wasn't disappointed, a disaster was exactly what I got.The first one was indecisive, the second one a wreck.The character's were confusing, not because it was difficult to follow, but because it was hard to care enough to pay attention to who they were and what they were doing.You watch the action without a plot and let your mind wander through the bulk of the mess. You perk up again when you hear Christopher Lambert, but only with the hops that he'd revert to his old head-hunting ways and grab a fast quickening from everyone involved in the movie.There is nothing to hold your attention here.

            "content": "First of all, I went in the cinema expecting nothing but trashy fun. When the trailer came out, it was obvious that this movie wasn't aiming to be the next THE DARK KNIGHT or something of that caliber. This thing was created by the guys behind CRANK and it features Ghost Rider pissing flames,for Christ's sake! All I wanted was a simple/ excuse story loaded with insanity driven action and over all craziness to satisfy the boring weekend afternoon. I didn't want a masterpiece, I just wanted something as crazy and enjoyable as the CRANK films only this time starring Ghost Rider.Well, apparently, I couldn't even have that.At first glance, the CRANK team and the Rider looked like a perfect match if the trailers were to be judged (and in my opinion they were) yet for some reason the movie failed badly. Majority of the film was a total bore with poorly delivered dialogue, flat acting and nerfed action scenes (coming from the CRANK guys I kind of expected more brutality but hey, it's another PG-13 movie for the kids). The only time I felt excitement that lasted more than a few seconds while watching the film was during the final chase scene where Ghost Rider chases the final bad guy in a series of well choreographed highway fights. The ending on the other hand, is easily the worst part of the film; to avoid spoiling anything important, I'll just say the ending killed the entire purpose of the Ghost Rider character.The movie had some nice ideas (the animations, some lines in the script, the interpretation of the main character, the action scenes, the weird insanity montage when Blaze pulled Ghost Rider out of his body, etc.) but these are not enough to even make the movie a guilty pleasure kind of deal. Instead all that's left is a lot of wasted potential in what could possibly be the worst film of the year (unless WRATH OF THE TITANS, BREAKING DAWN 2, BATTLESHIP or any of the SNOW WHITE movies manage to beat this one). Maybe if the studio allowed the directors to REALLY go all out (the kid-friendly PG-13 rating killed most of the action) or maybe if they got better writers the movie could've stood a chance at being a passable popcorn flick. I don't know what could've been but it's too late to even guess since I doubt there'll be a sequel for this movie.Unless you want to see a good reason why the PG-13 rating is bad for some characters or a good reason to waste your money, don't watch this. The titular character deserves so much more than this pathetic excuse of a movie.",

Virtually every aspect of this film is weaker than in the first one - half the budget, bad story, lack of characterization, sloppy action - but the effects definitely took the victory. The effects and animation are so poor that it's fun to laugh at them. However, I think a good deal has been deliberately done in such a way, so that the \"Spirit of Vengeance\" would be more similar to a comic book than to a Hollywood blockbuster. But whatever their intention was, if it wasn't so funny it would be pathetic. The film attempts to substantially copy the first one and be a credible sequel, and at the same time to completely change the visual and directional style, and in this gap, it tripped and fell. Still, it is far from being a disaster as it is represented. If you do not take it too seriously, you'll have fun.5/10",

But in this case - All I can say is WHAT HAPPENED?!Now I loved the first Ghost Rider, it wasn't fantastic but it was clever, had great actors, filmed in some great locations by a pretty decent DoP and had some cool music and was overall interesting.I Also dug the \"Chevios\" Duo-logy - \"Crank\" and \"Crank High Voltage.\" Then I saw \"Gamer\" and I was an instant Neveldine/Talor fanatic!I thought these guys would just keep getting better - But after watching this Cack Infested Poo Pile all I can do is scratch my scalp and yell WHAT HAPPENED?!?!I am going to go out on a limb and just guess that this film was marred by Production problems. The Whole Intro does NOT feel like Neveldine/Taylor, if feels more like a ghodawful Made-For SciFy Channel Piece o PooDoo.How'd they go from Gamer to THIS?!?! It's just too far of a drop in Quality.Also, from the accumulation of bizarre opening credits from movie companies I've never heard of with Logos that looked like they were Made in Tijuana by those guys who paint Matadors on Black Velvet, I get the impression that this film was financed by either a drug cartel or Loan Sharks.The Lame Company Logos - That's the mark of the Cheese-Brains who Produced this. Maybe they had the Money to finish the moovie, but then they had to GET INVOLVED in it when they should have been BARRED from the Set like Orson Welles did to the producers for Citizen Kane!Neveldine/Taylor are geniuses - They could have taken this cast and the money allotted and produced an Ass Kicker like High Voltage or Gamer. But the first few seconds of this utter Kack reveal BAD SCRIPT - LAME PLOT - STOOPID CROOKS - And to top it off, where Gamer had interesting William Gibson-Ish CyberPunk ideas in it, the writer in this one, goes STUPID on us in the area of IT Tech. Make a FIREWALL to keep Ghost Rider Out? You gotta be KIDDING me.I think Neveldine/Taylor ought to have taken their Names off of this. I think it was one of those deals where the Directors did a certain Job, and the finished product was edited by a Skag-Bag and wrecked anything interesting they may have been trying to do.I'd like to know, how this ended up being SO BAD. And for a Marvel Movie as well - Hey, was this even Released in Theatres? It's got the high robust quality of a Direct-To-DVD Release - and at that, \"Starship Troopers II: Hero of the Federation\" seems like Lord of the Rings quality compared to this - And THAT was a Bona-Fide Low Quality Movie!One of these Days, Either Neveldine/Taylor or Nick Cage or maybe even Idris Elba will explain to us WHY this moovie became the Turd of the 2010's.I DO NOT Blame Neveldine/Taylor at this point - Although, this BAD Moovie goes on their record as a permanent Black Mark. It's a sad day when this innovative Director Team is relegated to making Less than B Quality garbage.I Noticed this was \"Marvel Knights\" - Which also did the 2nd Punisher moovie, which was a supreme drop in quality to the one Tom Jain was in. Is this the Marvel \"Extreme Low Budget and Poor Quality\" division? Where's Val Lewton when ya Need him to make Low-Budget look like High-Budget? Oh thats right, Hollywood shoves guys like that right out the door. Hopefully that will not be N/T's fate, but will they get any more High Profile movies after this?",

I use that term loosely as I'm certain this assault on my senses was intended for torture or something equally as painful.There is nothing commendable here, save for one or two comic book-esque, animated scenes and the mention of Zarathos (a comic reference only us nerds will understand).One would assume that this cast could have produced something far superior, so I place all blame firmly on the directors, and unfortunately a hat tip to David S. Goyer's wafer thin, seen-it-all-before story which doesn't exactly inspire much confidence. To think he has written such epics as Batman Begins, oh how the mighty have fallen, in this case anyway.The shaky camera work, random zooming and absurd angles do nothing to enhance what is already a dreadful experience. The script, like most of the scenes, the action and settings, is completely incoherent at nearly all times. While the score is loud and ungainly throughout, never attributing to the ambiance if there was any to begin with.Ghost Rider with a twitch, well who'd have thought it? Here, what was portrayed fairly well in the first installment is completely abstract in both personality and appearance. Constant laughing, noises and very strange movement make this unconventional hero an utter joke, even the penance stare has been altered to what comes across as plain old shouting.If there were elements to praise then I would gladly do so, but there are not. I enjoyed the first film, which was hindered by a great many flaws. But in comparison, I am thankful to have seen the first, as it succeeds where this garbage fails miserably at every single turn.Long has it been since I can recount having seen something so ridiculously, outrageously, catastrophically useless.On the plus side, things can now only get better for this character, if anyone should ever dare to attempt another.

Although Ghost Rider 2007 release was quite cheesy, it was still watch- able. Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2011)is awful, distasteful and lacks a good plot.What really annoyed me was that I knew it was going to be a complete waste of time however the trailer promised the complete opposite. I was actually looking forward to seeing it just in case and I mean just in case.The storyline was pointless and the performances completely horrendous. What on earth happened to Nicolas Cage. I mean he was the true epitome of what an action hero should be (Con Air's a classic and Face Off is one of my all time favourites only to mention a few). This is what happens when you release 3 - 4 movies a year. You just lose the plot.Idris Alba's supposed French accent was a complete disaster and at some stage I honestly felt Nicolas Cage's was actually the one having a nervous break down and not the character Johnny Blaze. You really have to see it to get my drift and justified rant. Johnny Blaze's one liners, moments of madness and road to redemption was once again pointless and lacked substance. To know that the film cost $75m to make is just shocking! It did not even look like a Hollywood blockbuster. Felt more like buggy wimpy knock out!The only good thing about this movie is the fact that Ghost Rider actually looks really cool and much more realistic compared to the first one. The first one looked like a classroom skeleton on fire. You don't get a shiny white scull burning in in flames this time. You get something a lot more rugged and gruesome except for the fact that they literally forgot to complete the transition process of Ghost Rider taking people's souls. Nothing seems to happen when he tries to take people's souls. You are sitting there waiting, waiting and then waiting some more until Ghost Rider himself seems a bit confused. Look there is just no plot to this movie, the performances are completely horrible and I want half my money back. Like I said the only cool bit was the flaming skull and the really cool bike. It felt like it was breathing in oxygen and breathing out fire. My final verdict: Complete Waste of Time and Money!",

Especially not a movie whose trailer shows Nicholas Cage pissing fire. This sequel to 2007's Ghost Rider is by no means a horrid film; it looks amazing thanks to the advances in special effects and the kinetic camera work of directors Neveldine and Tylor.Ghost rider Spirit of Vengeance looks a lot better than its predecessor despite only having half the budget. It is darker, grittier and a lot more fun. Special effects have also taken a huge leap. The charred skull, body caked in ash with hellfire and smoke billowing forth sure beats the pasty white CGI skull and a stove flame from the first film. Neveldine and Tylor works the camera such that it is always in motion adding a heightened dynamic feel and energy to the whole show. Which is good since this movie needs all the energy it can muster.Essentially, the story is a poor man's excuse for a copy of Terminator 2. A boy named Danny (perhaps a shout out to Danny Ketch from the comics) is prophesised to become the vessel for the devil himself. A rogue french monk seeks out Johnny Blaze in order to enlist the help of the Ghost Rider in finding and protecting the boy from the forces of darkness. All the while, Blaze must struggle with his inner demon which threatens to take over him body and soul.Before you say \"But its written by David S Goyer! The dark Knight, Batman Begins, and Dark City were awesome\", do remember that he also wrote \"Jumper\" and Blade Trinity. And remember too that while writing Ghost Rider, he was most likely working on Dark Knight Rises. Something had to give and Dark Knight Rises, with its bigger budget, made the choice easy. Characterisations are thin, bordering purely on archetypes than trying to develop them at all. \"Strong protective mother\", \"wayward kid\", \"unstoppable hunter\". No attempt is made to develop any of them beyond archetypes. Yes there are the mandatory scenes of our dark hero earning the trust of his young companion and regaining some of his lose humanity butThe acting is mixed at best. Child actor Fergus Riordan shines as Danny. Same goes to Idris Elba as the french monk Moreau who despite his limited screen time, manages to make his character the most memorable in the film. Sadly a muddled screenplay, given the once over by 3 different writers, completely undermine their efforts. The only one who does not need his acting efforts underminded is Nicolas Cage himself. He hams his way through the role of Johnny Blaze, overacting and underacting at all the wrong times. Most hilarious is this scene where Johnny Blaze totally freaks out and goes crazy from trying to keep the Ghost Rider contained. Someone like Jim Carrey would have made it cool (he did in \"The Mask\") but seeing Nicholas Cage going batshit insane is just...........disturbing.Perhaps The greatest sin this movie commits is never giving a conflict or opponent that puts Ghost Rider's full power to the test. Fights never have that sense of peril when you know Ghost rider can immolate anyone with a touch or a stare. Action sequences get really boring when you know your hero is going to win. He takes out his chain, swings it about, fight over. And every time he does not win is because he does something silly, like stand around looking cool instead of finishing off opponents. Sure there is this one guy who can decompose a live person into skeletons with a single touch but Ghost Rider is neither alive nor a person.Maybe Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is not a straight faced movie. How can it be? It never takes itself seriously. Maybe it might have worked as a disorienting satire of dark anti-heros and quasi religious \"angel/devil\" ramblings. Alas any intent at satire is lost among three different writers and directors who are known for satirical, high octane thrills for the ADD afflicted sensory deprived generation .And they totally missed a good Highlander reference opportunity for Christopher Lambert.",

Not many protagonists work for the devil, dress head-to-toe in black leather, ride flaming motorcycles, or devour souls for the greater good of humanity. Unfortunately, the role is once again portrayed by the notorious plague known as Nicholas Cage (\"The Wicker Man\", \"Drive Angry\"), so it can't be taken as seriously as it should be. Ghost Rider should be awesome, or at least entertaining, but because of the flat acting and stilted writing in \"Spirit of Vengeance,\" the greater portion of humanity should avoid his latest outing.Johnny Blaze has already made one deal with the devil to obtain his powers and ultimately become Ghost Rider. In the new sequel, \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,\" Blaze decides to make another deal in an attempt to rid himself of his curse and save a young possessed boy in the process.Directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor (\"Crank\", \"Crank: High Voltage\") are notorious for their unique directing style. They'll (literally) go through flaming loops on roller blades for a good shot. This intense film-making is the film's only saving grace. But the overall intensity of the movie is overshadowed by poorly written characters and terrible dialogue\u2014both of which have nothing to contribute but additional plot holesThe movie is easy on the eyes with decent CGI and special effects, but just painful to the ears thanks to poor writing. Unless you really really like to see things on fire.... even fans of super-hero movies should avoid this atrocity.\"The Avengers\", \"The Dark Knight Rises\" and \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" are all coming soon, and will be better equipped.... batarangs and all... to satisfy our superhero movie needs!",

            "content": "\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\", Rated \"PG-13\" for Adult Situations, Adult Language, Strong Violence, Disturbing Imagery. Running Time: 1hr&35mns.My Take *1/2 (Out of ****) Oh dear. How should I start? I went to \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" and I overheard people during the end credits talk amongst themselves. \"I couldn't wait to see this movie\" said one gentleman. His colleague recounted with \"I couldn't wait for it to end.\" To be fair, here's another incident: I found myself talking with an aquaintence later on who also saw the feature. I mentioned that I planned to write a review on this movie. This was followed by a wincing face while he very softly said \"Ooooooh!\" As he shook his head, I knew with certainty this movie would be discussed in hushed tones by those who had seen it.For the uninitiated, \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" is the indirect sequel to 2007's \"Ghost Rider.\" These movies are based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name with the same premise. Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) is a daredevil stunt motorcyclist who made a pact with Mephistopheles (Ciaran Hinds, \"John Carter\") to cure his father's cancer in exchange for his soul. After a cruel twist of fate, Blaze got burned in the deal, losing his soul and becoming a demonic pawn of dark forces. He now has supernatural abilities and is able change at will into a fiery skull-headed demon known as \"The Rider,\" who has a fierce sense of justice. In this form, he is nearly indestructible and uses flaming chains as weapons.The new movie finds Blaze eight years after the events of the first picture. The cursed loner has left behind his normal life and is living a meager existence in Eastern Europe.In his earthly guise of \"Rourke,\" the devil is tracking his own son Danny (Fergus Riordan, \"I Want to Be a Soldier\") in order to inhabit his body. Rourke's current body is dying, as the devil in human form weakens the host. To do Rourke's bidding, the mercenary Ray Carrigan (Johnny Whitworth, \"Gamer\") and his merry band of goons are hot on Danny's trail.The boy and his mother Nadya (Violante Placido) are hiding within a monastery's castle when it is stormed. All the monks are killed and the duo is on the run. The drunken priest Moreau (Idris Elba, \"Thor\") finds and recruits Johnny Blaze to help protect the boy from the devil's insidious plan. Blaze is reluctant to unleash \"The Rider\" to defend Danny and make battle with the dark forces pursuing the boy. Moreau makes Blaze an offer he cannot refuse: access to a supernatural sect that can lift Blaze's curse and free him from his dark pact. With the prospect to regain his soul, how could he possibly say \"no\" to that?A conflict with the Ghost Rider leaves Carrigan dead. He is resurrected by Rourke as the dreaded Blackout, complete with supernatural abilities to siphon life and to decay anything he touches. A great example of his newfound powers is handled somewhat amusingly: Blackout touches a sandwich and it decays. Then he touches an apple, it too dissolves. Nothing happens when he picks up a Twinkie, affirming that a Twinkie will last forever. In this case, the Twinkie can even withstand evil powers.The Ghost Rider's new look is awesome, having been modified from the previous picture. This time, the skull is charred black, fierce and menacing. When the Rider sucks the sole of a baddie from him, he is truly a horrific force to be reckoned with. Towers of flames spirals off the Rider like a geyser. The way the Rider's leather jacket smolders, bubbles and smokes is a really great detail I haven't seen in the movies before.The MTV-like camera work was notably atrocious. Many scenes are presented with animation and other graphics that happen so quickly, when they are over you're not sure what happened. The hip, fluid, linear approach I am sure the filmmakers were going for is completely upstaged by an oversaturation of the medium. The effect is dizzying, unnerving and, quite frankly, amateur looking. How about the sound? I half wondered if I was going to be partially deaf for a day after seeing the movie, much like the day after a Motley Crue concert, due to the non-stop barrage of loud action sequences and ear-pounding music. If you want to replicate the effect, just put a metal bucket over your head and let a six-year old drum on it with a pair of mallets.I'm sure the studio felt there could be no wrong in green-lighting this picture. The 2007 original actually grossed money despite being panned by most critics. This new movie boasts a very impressive screen writing credit: that of David S. Goyer. He is best known as the man who breathed new life into the Batman revision for the films \"Batman Begins\" (2005) and \"The Dark Knight\" (2008). Surely, he was believed to be able to reinvigorate the Ghost Rider franchise after its dismal 2007 start.\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" is an un-engaging and un-interesting film that is an incoherent mess. I cannot fathom why anyone thought making this movie could possibly have been a good idea. It's frantic, chaotic and downright ugly. There is no sense of awe or fun, which is something you would want in a comic book based movie. If someone wanted to write a thesis on why they should stop making comic book movies, look no further than \"Ghost Rider II.\" Though, the comic book film gods will be working overtime this summer with the anticipated releases of \"The Avengers,\" \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" and \"The Dark Knight Rises\" (co-storied by Goyer). Hopefully any one of those films, if not all of them, can quell the memory of this disaster and save the genre from itself.",

I, and my family have been looking forward to see Johnny Blaze's next performance in a Ghost Rider film since his last in 2007, we went into the theatre with good expectations, 20 minutes into the movie we wanted to leave. The film does not do a good enough job in convincing people that Ghost Rider can be a house hold name, it seems to tarnish it. A horrible script/storyline, very weak acting, and terrible directing, the only thing good about this movie seemed to be the camera angles(which the directors took part in.) If the directors would have been more keen on direction for their actors, this film may have gotten a better review by audience members, but giving this film a 1 out of 10 stars is an understatement, this film really was a 0 out of 10 stars. This is the second movie I have wanted to walk out of, my first being \"Meet the Spartans,\" yeah it was that bad. I would advise anyone who is a fan of Ghost Rider, a fan of the first film, or a fan of movies in general to not see this movie at all as you are wasting your time and money. Go watch a better film out right now. I am highly disappointed in this film and can not believe how bad this film was, it was very cheesy as well.Let's hope that a third Ghost Rider film does not occur, but if it does Disney Studios/ Marvel Productions better buy the rights back to this character if they want to make an actual good Ghost Rider movie.R.I.P.

            "content": "So they say that while it has nicholas cage again as blaze, it's actually more of a reboot than a sequel. So it's a bit like what they did with the punisher/ punisher: warzone, and even hulk/incredible hulk films. With each film they tried doing a new start with an origin story to kick things off with... Then when those films flopped and they wanted to do more films with those characters later, they decide to reboot but rather than retread more origin stories (that people are getting sick to death of) they decided to just do a recap-heads-up of what their deal is pre-credits or during, so they could get on with a separate story to focus on. And for each film these reboots bettered the originals by pushing the action factor.With what i read i thought GR:SOV was going to be rubbish, but i was pleasantly surprised. what made this rewatchable was mainly both the action scenes at the construction site and the road chase later on, they were much better than the none event fights in the first film against the demons, and telling helicopter to go away... I heard the new skull had too much black smoke obscuring it, but no, it doesn't. The new skull is loads better, and on rewatching the first again I found GR1 to look far too cgi clean. The new rider has more chaotic personality than previous, perhaps because cage had his head rigged up and actually acted the skull out rather than a computer simulating movement and speech. This film leans more towards the darker grit side though not full on punisher warzone grit due to certification. They really shouldn't bother marketing marvel knights to kids, it's like keeping the training wheels on. Luckily it doesn't really effect this film. If you don't like this film, but liked the first then maybe you should stick to spider-man, because this one is closer to how movie ghost rider should be. Or even how a knights movie should be. The first encounter isn't very eventful, and the story just holds the scenes inline, but at least there is a proper villain this time in the form of blackout. If they do another, rather than yet another blaze reboot, i'd like to see the power passed onto the danny ketch version.",

            "content": "As I said before, in the review I wrote for \"Ghost Rider\", I'm not a fan or even an expert in comics, so I'll ignore the source material and focus on the movie. I'm not the right person to say whether or not it's a reliable adaptation. However, I can already say that it is a bad movie. With all its weaknesses, the first film was a work of art when compared to this unfortunate piece.The biggest problem with this movie is that it's a sequel designed to make money. Producers and studios didn't even bother to try to disguise their greed, and rubbed their hands at the good box office obtained. Poorly received by critics, the target of numerous criticisms from the public, but a relative success at the box office, the initial film paved the way for this sequel, which wouldn't be bad if it was a good sequel. Unfortunately, almost the entire cast and crew of the first film (except for Nicolas Cage) is absent from this project, which adopts a totally different visual and dramatic language from the previous film and, thus, cuts any hypothetical continuity.The script is mediocre and is based on a fight between Johnny Blaze and especially powerful evil forces that want to kidnap a child, supposedly the son of the Devil, key-figure to Armageddon. Simple, extremely clich\u00e9d, very poorly crafted and poorly developed, it's a script worthy of a 70's B-movie. All the dense atmosphere and something sinister we saw in the initial film is totally absent, having been replaced by something lighter, \"hard rock\" and eventually designed for young adults and teenagers aspiring to be rockers. The fast pace with which everything happens favors the logical flaws, which appear in the script with the magnificence of Baroque palaces, being impossible to ignore them: the case of the monks, with medieval robes and caves coexisting with high-tech devices, weapons that would suffice for Ukraine for a year, and wine capable of getting half the Russian troops drunk, is one of the most egregious. I'd rather not talk about the ability to decompose objects and food that one of the characters will acquire at the end, and that seem to work only when it's convenient for the film.Nicolas Cage is still present in the film, but he is the only one from the previous cast to do so, since all the others, especially Eva Mendes and Peter Fonda, dropped out of the project after reading the script. Smart decision. Cage, if not brilliant in the first film, is mediocre in the sequel, with a one-dimensional, apathetic and sleepy interpretation. Ciar\u00e1n Hinds is doing well and doing a great job and very worthy, but he doesn't have much to do, while Violante Placido and Idris Elba, despite their efforts and some good moments, don't make more than an average effort.Technically, the film bets massively on CGI, of great visual and dramatic effect, with the flames and the whole apparatus around the Rider reaching hyperbolic levels. The mine scenes are perhaps the most obvious example of what I'm saying: enough bullets for a military battle, fire everywhere, that huge machine... everything taken to the extreme for visual grandeur and spectacularity. It sometimes worked, there's no denying it, but it often feels like something out of a computer game. Set in an area of Central Europe, the film was partially shot in Romania and makes good use of the beauty of the chosen locations. The sets and costumes are decent given the script and location, and the soundtrack is heavy, tiresome and uninteresting. Worse, however, are the sound effects used, as they are often clearly fake.",

This movie was a bit of an eyesore.First, the plot. The plot didn't flow really well. It could have been a great film if it was pieced together properly. But the scene transitions were awful and it jumbled the movie into a huge mess. Because of that, this movie was not explained adequately, like how could Johnny want to lift his curse when he said he was going to own his curse at the end of the first film? Actually, that also brings me to another thing that went wrong with it.That would be the editing. The motion capture seems like a ripoff of the reality show Survivor. It would zoom into the scene, sometimes unnecessarily, and that honestly made my head spin. If they were going to use such a tool, at least use it to help tell the story and not make us dizzy!This movie also failed on making the devil. The devil didn't look so... tame-looking. The devil in the first movie looked so much more like a devil should look like. The new characters were all flat too. Idris Elba's character was banal, I didn't care for the mother and I only rooted for her because she was hot. Nor did I care about Danny because he did nothing to make him stand out in any notable way.So why 4 stars? Because any time Johnny becomes the Ghost Rider, it makes the movie worthwhile. He at least retains his badassery, which is demonstrated with, for example, the transforming of machines into fiery weapons. Johnny isn't annoying in his human form either. His connection with his Ghost Rider spirit at least does get more exposition when the rest of the movie doesn't. It is the actual Ghost Rider himself that keeps this movie from being one of the worst movies ever.",

It was and still is one of my favorite films and that is why I feel like I was just punched in the stomach by Sylvester Stallone! These people took one of my all time favorite superheroes and make him a complete joke! When I was a young lad and watched Ghost Rider for the first time I fell in love with every element of it (apparently I was one of the only ones, oh well people have opinions) and when I saw that there was going to be a sequel in the near future I got my hopes up and began the wait When the trailer came out I thought it looked pretty decent, like it was gonna be a fun ride...I was wrong, oh so very wrong. The story was a piece of garbage that was rushed at an incredible pace making it hard to believe it was even a movie at points. The way Mark Neveldine and Brain Taylor direct is simply horrendous and hard to watch, everything moves so fast and the camera won't stay still for a second, it gives me a bloody headache, but that's just my opinion. And the list goes on! They changed the Ghost Rider from a BA avenger who gave bad guys what they deserved into a complete and utter joke. One of the things that stuck with me from the first film was the penance stare, I was praying to see a lot of this! All he does is yell, no cool little tricks, he just yells and incinerates people, that's it. However this is just my opinion, if you are a big fan of the Crank movies or are a big adrenalin junkie give it a try.",

Ghost rider:Spirit of Vengeance is a poorly written movie. And the plot seems as though made up on the sets as the shooting was progressing! Nic Cage looks confused as Blaze and as the Ghost Rider. And so does everyone else in the film!! Even Idris Elba was reduced to a bumbling fool. So the casting was definitely terrible. And a movie is generally special if the chemistry between the characters is special. But here very little time is invested in developing any relationship between the characters. And why was this movie made in 3D? The only 3D part of this film I enjoyed was right at the beginning, even before the movie started - The ad for \"Real 3D\" ! I still give the movie 2 stars because I like how the movie ends promising a conceptually different take for another sequel (if at all it happens).",

I was trying to figure out what in the world is going on, but within five minutes it was too late. It was heading for disaster. What was the whole purchase? To be honest I don't know. All I can say is that the plot was useless. My question is that why in the world would Columbia Pictures would green-light this movie? If the first movie was bad, why bother making a sequel? Did anybody actually bother to read the script? I guess not. David S. Goyer, the co-writer of The Dark Knight and this film, either should've rewritten the script or shouldn't get involve with the project at all. The dialogue is enormously cheesy and poorly delivered. For example, Nicolas Cage is having a conversation with a kid name Daniel who says \"Did we win?\" and he replays \"Yes, hell yes. Hell (he said the f word, but I can't say it) yeah.\" See what I mean. Nicolas Cage delivers the worst performance of his career. His role was extremely over the top and hilarious because how bad it was. Sometimes I feel sorry for the man because he has no choice but to play these kinds of roles due to the problems with his taxes (He apparently owns $20 million to the IRS). Films like Cloverfield, The Bourne Trilogy, and The Prestige are mostly shot using hand-held technique and are well used, but not this film. Instead the technique was poorly used because it was too fast and too shaky. Sometimes we need action sequence to cheer us up, but even the action scenes did not save the movie. It was plain out boring. The special effects are a mess for an $80 million budget.In the end, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is a waist of time. It will go down in history as one of the worst comic book films of all time. To be honest, I nearly walked out at the movie, but somewhere in my heart, I decided not to, but I wish I did.F-",

Besides the admittedly awesome skeletal warrior showing up on screen and being a genuinely good element of the film, the character's badassery isn't complemented by the film's lacklustre screenplay; though it's nice there's some good action here and there, and Idris Elba's always a scene-stealer even if he's at the mercy of a crappy story.Ghost Rider 2; one of the movies of all time, and one of the 2010s' defining 'because movie' films to ever come from Hollywood. Good or bad, there's something to take away here even if it's mostly stuff that's NOT in the film. It goes to show that a singularly awesome character NEEDS an equally awesome ensemble of supporting characters to work, otherwise the story just doesn't feel worthwhile and sadly pointless.This is good ironic viewing; if you're expecting a genuinely good time, get ready to reevaluate your expectations before you watch. 1/5 stars.",

The story in itself is quite terrible and as always oriented around romance and these kind of nonsense. The thing I don't understand and did not understand throughout all the movie which was emphasized by certain scenes is if the devil is omniscient, like he is in reality and just like God, then you really have to ask then how comes he never sees anything coming and especially when they (the normal humans beings) are about to deliver the boy ? This does not make any sense at all.Secondly, the action scenes are quite terrible and fake. You could read the chord or whatever method they used to construct the fights, guide the actors during these periods [...] quite catastrophic.I generally hate action movies because you can always feel the tendencies of the writers to pull for a certain end and this movie, halfway through, you already knew all what was to be known as of how the story was going to unfold. I find that terrible and quite a waste because it really has potential. Certain actions in the film are also quite non explainable, for example the fact that the mother was able to catch the group in like about 5 minutes when they had already left her way behind in that dome, or, whatever that was.

The story was incomprehensible, the characters were lame, the action was blurry and confused, and the cinematography was trash.If anyone told me that this movie had a good story, I'd punch them in the face. There was absolutely no story! I had no idea what Nicolas Cage was doing. I couldn't make out any of the characters' motives for doing whatever it was they were doing, for that matter. I couldn't even understand half of what they were saying! The pacing in the movie was so choppy, it made me wonder what kind of drunk, screwed-up people wrote this piece of garbage. Also, the whole sequence about the \"angel of justice\" left me completely confused.The characters were half formed, flat, cardboard cutouts. None of them had any depth. None of the emotions they portrayed were believable. Some little things I noticed about them left me thinking, \"What the heck?!\" For example, in the first fight scene where Nic Cage's character attempts to defeat a group of thugs harassing a woman and her son, he jumps in, and instead of taking them out easily like he could have done, he stands there for ten minutes straight, swaying back and forth for no reason whatsoever. Then he starts fighting, and the thugs kick his butt way too easily. Later in the movie, he is facing a group of enemies again, and this time, he kills them all immediately with one swipe of his chain. How does this make any sense? I had no feelings of sympathy or understanding for any of the characters. It was one of those movies that I sat in, wishing that all of them would die in the end.The action scenes could have been exciting, but they weren't. Something was weird about them, like something was missing: like maybe some good motives for the characters fighting, or maybe a way to tell who was a good guy and who was a bad guy. Also, while the special effects improved from the last movie, there was still something quite unremarkable about the fiery explosions. Even now after thinking about it for a while, I still can't fully explain why everything about the action seemed so... lame.I thought the cinematography in Battle: Los Angeles was bad, but this movie just beat it by a lot. I could not make out what was happening in about 75% of the movie. The camera was jerking and shaking uncontrollably almost the entire time! Even in the more calmer scenes, the camera still moved around like we were supposed to expect something to happen suddenly. The characters jumped everywhere on the screen, with no regards to the laws of physics, or even reality. In one scene, Nic Cage and some other guy are fighting on top of a car. At one point, one of them flips the other one over, and the camera flies around with them, and somehow they both end up on the top of another car. I don't even know what happened! One last thing: the locations of the characters was unknown to me the entire time, and they jumped from place to place in every scene with no explanation of how they got there and why they went there in the first place.This has to be the worst movie I have seen to date. The only reason me, my brother, and his friend stayed the whole time was because I had paid $30 for our tickets. Although, even after staying for the whole movie, I still felt like my money was completely wasted. This movie is the worst thing ever. The \"story,\" the characters, the action, the cinematography, EVERYTHING about this movie was terrible, and a complete waste of time. Do not see this movie. If you can believe it, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance makes the famously crappy Batman and Robin look like movie-making genius.",

The only limitation to his powers seems to be that he can not scorch each and everyone of his opponents immediately, so some shouting and waving of the flaming bike chain must be involved (cue constant cgi).The lack of real obstacles, outside the obvious time and space, of course, leads to another deficit, and that's a lack of excitement in this film. At no point is Ghost Rider's success under any credible threat. Maybe he might eventually get bored with all the fire being summoned and sinners being scorched that he'll just say \"to hell with all this\" and quits? I know I was close to that point with this film.As the filmmakers realized that demonic possessions creating violence is not enough of an excuse to make a movie, they decided that demonic possession may also create drama. I completely understand that being possessed by something originating from the depths of hell can be a real drag and may drive a man in to deep depression, yet it's a bit hard for the average viewer to relate with the internal struggles of a stunt biker who keeps turning into a fiery and inextinguishable spirit of vengeance to fight Satan.This film is just flashing images and loud sounds.

Many people didn't like it but I thought it was very well done.I saw \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\", thinking that it would continue where \"Ghost Rider\" left off. I was completely lost for most of \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\". I only understood the plot when I read it on IMDb, after seeing the movie. Mephistopheles does not appear in this film. It's not Peter Fonda, but some fat older guy, representing the devil. The way Johnny made the deal is a lot different and more stupid. In this movie, Blaze made the deal by smashing a vile with his fist, and then by spraying a stream of blood on the contract. The biggest problem for me, however, was the fact that they ruined the Ghost Rider himself. This new Ghost Rider LOOKED cool but the Ghost Rider acts like some insane mental case that just escaped from an asylum. Instead of saying \"look into my eyes\" to his victim (killing him minutes later, after the victim has seen all the evil they've done), like in the first \"Ghost Rider\", the new Ghost Rider stares at his victim for 5 boring minutes. Then after shaking his head around like he's being annoyed by a swarm of bees, the victim screams and then just falls to the ground. On top of all of this, the director had $75 Million to work with! Are you kidding me? This guy had more money than Steven Spielberg had to make \"Saving Private Ryan\". The directors, Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, and the writers, Scott M. Gimple (screenplay) and Seth Hoffman suck, in my opinion. The only good thing about this movie is a few cool special effects and Nicholas Cage. However, he only does a bad job as his character because the writers gave him nothing to work with. I will never watch any movie, in future, if it is written or directed by the people listed above. In my opinion if you have a huge load of money to make a movie, and you can't make it a good movie, then DON\"T MAKE IT! If you saw \"Ghost Rider\" and think that this movie will also be good because you were fooled by the trailer, DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE! I cannot describe the disappointment you will receive.

Mark Steven Johnson did an absolute wonderful job writing and directing the original Ghostrider whereas Mark Neveldine the director for GR2 and Scott Gimple the writer produced a flop. The original storyline is not maintained and the low budget of the film showed thru with poor CGI effects and the 3D was totally lost and useless. The loss of the Rider persona and the Bike he rode destroyed the flavor of the movie from the very beginning. Nicholas Cage's performance in the original was amazing whereas his performance in GR2 can hardly be described as acting. This movie had such great potential and had Mark Steven Johnson been involved it could have achieved that potential.",

Although the CGI and the FX are really good, they depend and abuse on them. What can I say about the cast. Nicolas Cage is definitely awful, the only thing he does is laugh and scream all his lines. Violante Placido's performance was really weak, Ciaran Hinds as Roark is way overacted, maybe the only good performance was the one of Fergus Riordan as Danny. In conclusion, if you are one of the people that thought the first one was bad (not including me) well I recommend you not to go and watch this one and if you still want to watch it well, it's under your own risk.",

            "content": "When I first heard they were making a sequel to the first Ghost Rider film, I have to say that I really had no interest in seeing it at all after the first installment. Then I heard the directors from Crank would be directing the film and it gave me hope that the movie might actually be good. I then saw the first trailer and I suddenly became excited! The special effects looked better, the tone was darker, and the action looked bad-ass! I was all the sudden on board with the film and even if it wasn't that great, I figured there was no way they could make a film as bad as the last one.Sadly, I was wrong.Now let me get something clear: While I did enjoy watching this one more, I can't really call it a better film. Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance in some ways is actually worse than the first film. But, some things in it are also better.The action for example, is for the most part better in this installment. There's a lot more of it than the last film and when it is going on, it's pretty bad-ass. However, some of the action (espicaly early on in the film) is actually really slowed paced and frustrating to watch. The trailer also gives away many of the good action shots so there's not a whole lot of cool action in here that you haven't already seen in the trailers. The effects here (espicaly Ghost Rider himself) actually don't look that bad and fit the tone of the film well and the soundtrack sounds incredibly bad-ass! Sadly, thats all the good stuff I can really say about this film. The plot here which involves Johnny trying to save a young boy from the devil is horrible! I didn't mind the cheesy plot at first, but the film invest way too much time into what already is a horrible story when it should've been focusing on action. Going into this, I actually wanted the film to be cheesy, but it gets to the point where the film is no longer cheesy and just plain bad. The acting is awful and Nicolas Cage's performance is so awful that it's unintentionally hilarious although he does have a few good moments where he goes over-the-top. The dialogue is absolutely atrocious and is easily some of the worst i've heard in a long time. I couldn't believe how bad some of the lines in this movie were. The editing and camera-work is also done very poorly here and gives the film a sloppy messy feel to it that it does not need. The film also just stops instead of having a real ending to it similar to the way Transformers 3 ends.I really tried hard to enjoy this film but I just couldn't. I am rating it a bit higher than I should though because the film did make for a fun time since I spent most of it laughing at how bad it was. But, there were small things in it that I did enjoy. Still, Spirit of Vengeance is only slightly better than the first film and in many ways even worse than it. Those looking for an over-the-top stupid action movie will be let down by the lack of action the film has at some points and the sloppy filmmaking. Not even the Crank boys could save this one.",

That was the main issue for me. I had very little idea just what was going on and was lost pretty quickly. The story was old and boring and did not do anything to make me feel like caring about the film or any of the characters in it.Nicolas Cage is annoying as Johny Blaze again, I think probably not as annoying as in the first film but pretty close. Its hard for me to get into a film with a protagonist who is not someone that I can cheer for.I did like the look for Ghost Rider tho. He looked pretty cool. A few of the action scenes are OK too.

            "content": "Ghost Rider: Spirit Of Vengeance It's really not a good sign when the trailers you've seen multiple times are more entertaining than the following feature.________________________ Having seen the first movie, I honestly didn't have much hope for this, and thanks to that because I would have bee let down had any expectation been present.I started not liking this movie about 10 minutes into it. The opening of the movie there is a man on a motorcycle (Moreau) riding up to some secluded castle in Europe. Arrives, takes off his helmet and starts talking to a group of priests, talking about this 'boy' and how he needs to be protected until the solstice is over... The priest says, \"The boy is safe here...\"this is a fortress\"... Seconds later a group of 12 thugs with machine guns overrun the place, the boy and the mother (where did the mother come from?) flee in a small car.At this time, I almost thought 'what movie am I watching? Then an animated credits came up, with Nic Cage voice over \"Deal with the devil, demon powers etc...\" ________________________ It intros Johnny Blaze, hiding in foreign countries, running from the hunger inside (basically like Ed Norton in The Incredible Hulk). He is tracked down by Monroe, the drunk french priest and told that he is meant to save the same boy from the opening. Johnny doesn't buy it but the man says he can take his curse away.So that night Johnny Lets his guard down and unleashes the rider. Being able to 'sense' the boy (doesn't explain the up front) he finds the boy and mother trapped by the same thugs whom have been following them for days and just seemed to think \"hmm days later, at night, that is when we should then take the boy back\" FINALLY, you actually see the rider do something, he rides in, flying overhead lands past them. Baddass'ery and all turns around, flaming head, jacket bubbling, chains in hand ready to take somebody out...Then it just stands there for 2 minutes, the terrible monotonous guitar riff's over and over. I was confused, the bad guys seemed confused, everyone just kept looking at each other. Then finally like butter, the rider slashes his chain through two baddies, machine gun fire! The Rider spits the bullets right back at him in a fiery blast.Then the most metro, non threatening mercenary ever grabs a grenade launcher and blasts the Rider.Then Johnny Blaze is escaping from the hospital and going to continue this pursuit. WAIT WHAT?!? He is on fire, eats souls and has no flesh but an explosion takes him out?...________________________ What else bothered me...***Spoilers*** You find out this mother protecting this kid also made a deal with the devil (Rourke) and the son is the product of that deal. It does not out how, just a two second flash back of the devil seeing her dying from a fall and saying \"looks like you could use some help\". Was the baby (who is now a teenager in the movie) immaculately conceived? Did he rapidly grow and age, because the lady who made the deal was not thirteen years younger.The main thug (Carrington) later shoots a freaking missile at the Rider and that seems to have no effect. In the ensuing fight, dies did NOT make any deal with the devil, dies, and then is brought back and given the power to decay things? No dramatic scene, coughing up blood, struggling to breathe \"You can't let me die, you need me!\" scene where the devil walks up all suave and calls him a maggot and such... They didn't even refer to the enemy as 'pestilence' or anything in the movie.The dialogue! Oh my goodness the dialogue. The handful of terrible one liners, awkward pauses and empty and childish insults from everyone does the audience and the characters no credit.They introduced Christopher Lambert as a character, immediately killing him.The Rider kept on staring his victims down face to face screening and nothing happens... no face melting, no soul stealing, then they might die in a bit...________________________ And really... the Devil seemed to be useless the whole movie, didn't threaten anyone, didn't do anything, barely was in it. The Devil was kind of a bitch.If you loved the first one... you will still hate this.DON'T Watch this.****************************** Update! : EVERY, no exaggeration, every shot from this movie was from the viewpoint of a child.Example: Rider walking 6 feet? - Camera @ feet pointed up Dialogue and people just talking? - Camera at crotch level pointed up Motorcycle moving or car chase? - Up It is like the entire crew had fanny pack camera for the entire shoot!!!",

            "content": "Are you familiar with the song Crash and Burn by Savage Garden? The song ideally discusses a theme of togetherness for good or for bad come what may. Nicolas Cage did not learn the first time with GHOST RIDER back in 2007 although co \u2013star Eva Mendez did. Instead, the action-hero (of the yester years) is adamant of going up in fire by playing Johnny Blaze the 2nd time round. It is hard to watch someone you are a fan of fail isn't it? Since of late it is without a doubt that Nicolas Cage fans are feeling this. 2011 is not one of the best years of his career and the curtain raiser for 2012 seems to have crash and burned as well. Gone are the days where wise choices are being made it seems, it's as if the economic crisis is effecting the big names of Hollywood. Someone or the other seems to be picking up lousy scripts putting in a few bucks into it and trying to earn some fast cash. How successful that plan worked out to be is obvious on the box office maps of GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE.What exactly went wrong this time round? The answer is simple and it isn't rocket science. The marvel comic Ghost Rider is considered the most supernatural hero of all. Now it is understood that movie industry is massive and is a great way to mint money (Ask Robert Downey Jr), however when you make a movie which ideally should be rated by MPAA as R in the format of PG 13 it destroys the entire concept of the comic. In simple terms it absolutely castrates the GHOST RIDER. Mark Neveldine (Jonah Hex, Gamer) and Brian Taylor (Gamer, Crank) are known for making movies that hit rock bottom. Either they clearly lack the vision of what a good script is or somewhere down the line they overstretch the creativity making movies that should be categorized as time wasters. Not even the acting is able save GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE. Nicolas Cage and Ben Affleck need to steer clear of superhero movies; it clearly isn't there strong suite. Idris Elba does some justice to his portrayal of Moreau and so does Ciaran Hinds with Roarke while the others merely falter at every stage to connect with the audience. Poor direction, below average characterization, CGI which is putrid GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE indeed my number one flop hit of 2012 thus far.Johnny Blaze returns after 5 years of running from the darkness that lives inside him. Johnny Blaze who sold his soul to the devil as a youngster is haunted by The Rider. Elsewhere in Eastern Europe, Danny and his mother Nadya are being hunted down by a group of assassins. Ray who leads the group of assassins is hired by the dark lord himself to capture Danny. It seems that the dark lord has some interest in the youngster much like he had with Johnny. A lone ranger (Moreau) who is on a mission to protect Danny needs the help of the Rider, but can they dark rider find in him some element of kindness to something good for a change? The synopsis alone sounds horrible to me; fear not the movie lives up to this in every aspect.SKIP THIS ONE!TITLE: GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE.

            "content": "The movie is just horrible. But I would just like to point out a couple of things. The first couple of minutes is probably the best part of the whole film. The first thing to notice about the beginning is that I didn't know I was watching \"The Matrix\" when Idris Elba jumped off his bike and froze time to shoot at the enemy's suv. When you go further into the film, you realize there is a lot of skipped information which made the movie very hard to follow. Many people seemed to already cover this so I will be brief. THE MOTIVE WAS TO GET THE KID. Ghost Rider goes and stares down some randoms for like 2 minutes and forgot what he was looking for. Lets the enemy escape (obviously).You will notice that the guy behind it all is suppose to be a big all mighty powerful demon but he does nothing throughout the film that shows that; all talk basically. He acted like a big sack of potatoes. He gives power to Ray but the power makes no sense. It seemed like he can't control it (i.e the apple and sandwich scene) but something with a wrapper on it makes it all good? There is just too much things in this movie that made no sense.The ending has to be the worst of them all. Not many people commented on this (im guessing because they'd had left the theatre before it ended). Cage apparently released the GOOD side to the demon-----question is how? What? He all of the sudden could control the demon? Or am I forgetting that in both Ghost rider films, they made it clear the demon is too powerful to control, ever!!!!",

            "content": "\"The Rider gonna come out. And when he does, he'll destroy whoever's got it coming\". Yeahh, you're right! It destroys everything in its path! From now on, whenever you hear the words \"Ghost Rider\", the first thing that comes to your mind it will be a veryy baddd movie! They definitely don't have enough good basic material to build a reasonable movie in the first place, thiz is for the second time! The first \"Ghost Rider\" in 2007 was one of the ugliest superhero movies ever made. Anyway, I have my respect for the Directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor. Generally, I like their works especially the stylish camera angle and color structure. A little bit rough, energetic and sometimes comical with fast moving scenes exactly like they have shown in \"Crank\" (2006) and \"Gamer\" (2009). But that's certainly not enough. Thiz time, Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage), the alter-ego of Ghost Rider has to protect a child from The Devil in human form upon the request of a monk named Moreau (Idris Elba). The storyline is obviously weak in all aspects. They tell a simple story in long and boring 90+ minutes. Furthermore, the setting is told in Europe. Hello... where is the Europe? I don't see Europe! All I see is desert and rocky mountain in the middle of nowhere. After all, the Ghost Rider's character is originally dark and mysterious. That atmosphere is clearly not shown here. They are using too much sick humor and too much clear blue sky, if you know what I mean. It comes to my mind, it would be totally different if they hire the Director who knows how to make a convincing shade of dark Gothic like Tim Burton or Guillermo del Toro. The next thing is Nicolas Cage. I don't know what actually happens to Cage, he obviously tries to look cool with his cheesy one-liner dialogue. Furthermore, at some scenes when Blaze struggles to hold back the demon inside him to come out, he creates a very strange and amusing expression. The rest of the Cast members deliver B-Class performance such as Idris Elba, Violante Placido, Johnny Whitworth, Christopher Lambert and even the child Fergus Riordan. The Devil once said to Johnny Blaze, \"You were the worst frickin' deal I ever made\". well, I have my complaint too, I just want my money back!

            "content": "I really liked Ghost Rider movie that came out 2007, despite the movie being cheesy and feeling like a low budget movie, I liked the story plot of that movie.When I saw this movie Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance trailer at the cinema, I knew it would be an underwhelming movie from the impression trailer. Now I finally watched it and it saddens me that the movie disappoints.This time the movie production studio had bigger budget than last time. But sadly the budget was spent on the giant drilling machine and vfx of Ghost Rider.Characters are not so great, Nicolas Cage reprises the role of Johnny Blaze and while he is ok as the actor, he kinda lost that soulless Johnny Blaze from the first movie. Idris Elba was not convincing because of the fake accent he uses, which also disappears half the time. Other characters were lacklusters.The story feels like a retelling of the original Ghost Rider movie as different scenes were used for the backstory filler. And the scenes they used looked so low budget! First movie made sense because he didn't intend to sign the contract.The biggest grip I hated about this movie were:\n1) stupid Ghost Rider character. In this movie, he was shown more of a terror character rather than a badass character from first movie. The way he jerky moves, or spins after being hit by a javalin missile was so STUPID. I understand the director having a cool vision for Ghost Rider to look scary and cool at the same time, but those things just appeals to children.Also chains coming out of his mouth, guns firing into his mouth. Nothing makes NO sense! Also you wonder if Ghost Rider can even get hurt. In the first movie they made a mistake by allowing Johnny Blaze to be hurt after he was stabbed on his shoulder as Ghost Rider. In this movie they did the same stupid mistake! Can Ghost Rider be hurt or not???2) the stupid exposure effects. A scene where they visited the monks, they used too much bloom effect that the location just felt too fantasy. It had too much bloom effect!Also why is it every damn time the Decay demon uses his power, there is always a dark exposure to the visual scene? That sh* was so damn annoying and pointless!!!3) also why did the made Ghost Rider spirit as an angel? Angel cast down but corrupted by ways of the world. Yet in the first movie the Care Taker was living in the western time and not modern city. So how could the ghost rider be corrupted by clubbing, drugs, anarchy etc shown in that flash back?In the first movie, whenever Ghost Rider does the penance stare, you can see a nice effect. In this movie, there is nothing happening, you are totally unaware he is even doing the penance stare. Like I said, vfx budget went towards making Ghost Rider look realistic.The movie had weak action, nothing that wows you, the music were lackluster. I really love the jail scene in first Ghost Rider movie, that music and jacket scene was so badass. This movie touched nothing like that, peeing Flamethrower was stupid.I think if this movie was rated R or 18, it could be good. The movie started off very good like a nice action movie but shortly after the first encounter with Ghost Rider, the movie fell short and boring.Final scene with devil Roarke, why the hell is he even called that??? His damn name is Mephisto or Mephistophilis! Anyway that fight was so damn underwhelming!!!It is such a shame the movie is disappointing. Marvel would stay AWAY from Ghost Rider ip for quite some time until people miss him, or demand for him or simply forget him.",

They even changed the flames colour to neon blue at some point.GR doesn't have a penance stare any more and nothing happens to his victims when he stares at them (?). Also I noticed a couple of out of sync sound/visual scenes in there somewhere.GR has a black charcoal skull which is not bad it kinda fits in with the black smoke and flames profile they have given to the new GR.GR scary faces while in trans mode are really funny and Cage is over acting the crazy guy changing into a flaming monster character. All scenes are very complicated and give the movie a visual boost but not any atmosphere.GR rides a Yamaha and not the classic US custom bike. The bike looks good I wonder what will they choose for the next bike, I hope not the same Yamaha model.There is no big boss final battle, GR is just throwing his creator into a hellfire hole with the help of a possessed kid. And that's it. What happened to all the colorful enemies GR has in the comic books ??Overall I'm getting the B-Movie feeling all over this and the Christopher Lambert appearance at the end destroyed it. I thought I was watching another Highlander TV show or something.I hope they choose another actor for GR next time and just try to put some kind of atmosphere in there without all these computer fake scenes. GR movies need a good photography concept and sound to get noticed by the old fans like the frank miller movies. Otherwise it is just a match between who makes the best cgi movies.",

Shameful that no movie based off comic book super heroes ever follows the plot. Total twisting of how pact with the devil transpired. Young Johnny Blaze was ignorant of what he was doing, thought it was a joke. Johnny punctured his finger on sharp edge of contract scroll, dripped blood onto scroll at which point devil said that will do just fine. Rider in original movie had pearl white bone (skull, and hand bones), bright orange flames enshrouded him, clothes were clean. Image of Rider in Spirit Of Vengeance looked like he was covered in grease, ash and soot. Other than converting back to his human form and losing his Ghost Rider powers in sun light in Ghost Rider the Rider had no weakness in Spirit Of Vengeance major whuss. In Ghost Rider he easily held his own against Blackheart and the Fallen. Blackheart was created in hell and the Rider still easily beat him. What was with his Pennance Stare it was far more impressive in Ghost Rider. He was getting his butt kicked by the transformed Carrigan, I think Carrigan finally fell to the stare, which by the way metal and glass are not subject to decomposition, corrosion, rust, being melted into slag, but not rotting, yet another error on the part of the screen writers. In Ghost Rider Johnny had to voluntarily give up the hellfire he was possessed with, and no 1 could control him but in Spirit Of Vengeance Danny was was able to keep the Rider from using his powers.",

When I first saw the trailer, I was a bit disapproving about the black skull instead of white and the changes made on the Rider's bike, but somehow I got over it. Trailer looked promising to me, but when I finally got to watch the movie I was hit in the face with bad acting, poor story-telling and stupid jokes. The movie lost it's darkness and the action scenes were so exaggerated that they lost any common sense. There are no words to explain how bad this movie is and I must admit that I'm sorry they ever made it. I almost walked away from the cinema and I don't do that that often. In fact, I remember only two movies I stopped watching before the ending.If Hollywood ever decides to make a Ghost Rider 3, I hope they return to direction the first one was going. Because it had the right emotion, serious story, great acting and most of all... breath-taking Rider's first transformation. Furthermore, Peter Fonda's incarnation of the Devil was so dark and demonic, in one word \"awsome\".To conclude, do NOT waste your time on this movie, because it's simply AWFUL.",

            "content": "Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance is a truly awful movie, not only is it an embarrassment to this character that is featured in the title, but it is an embarrassment to the superhero genre as a whole. So, it is a ever so slight downgrade from its predecessor. Nicolas Cage reprises his role as Johnny Blaze in Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance. In this gritty new vision for the character, directed by Neveldine/Taylor (Crank), Johnny is still struggling with his curse as the devil's bounty hunter - but he may risk everything as he teams up with the leader of a group of rebel monks (Idris Elba) to save a young boy from the devil... and possibly rid himself of his curse forever. -- (Sony) The plot is that Johnny Blaze, played by Nicholas Cage, must protect a child from the devil and his forces. Sounds fun right? Well it is... for about 20 minutes. The rest of the film is complete dog crap. The plot is a nonsensical mess full of plot holes and outright stupid moments (In the end he turns into, basically the angel rider... I am serious). This script is poorly written and shows that whoever wrote it has no knowledge of the character, and the dialogue written is atrocious and unintentionally funny. The acting here is a slight improvement, but seeing as how the acting in the previous film was some of the worst ever shown in a superhero movie that isn't saying much. Nicholas Cage still looks like he's on meth throughout the whole thing, and everyone else is barely trying. The only positive I have is that the special effects look decent. Ghost Rider: Spirit Of Vengeance downright sucks. It is clear that it was meant to be campy fun, but that doesn't work with a character like this with an established history, and it ends up being utter poo because of it.",

It was a little campy, but it's a comic book movie about flaming skull demon biker guy. Anywho, they changed directors and the franchise went downhill (or bottomed out, depending what you thought of the first). A lot of reviewers claim a bad story, but having read thousands of comic books, it plays out to me like a 3-4 issue pretty normal Ghost Rider story arc. The pacing is a bit jerky, but the story is as coherent as this kind of tale can be. The acting however is remarkably terrible. Cage is a different level of manic that doesn't stay true to the Johnny Blaze character, either the one from the comics or from the previous film. The actor playing Satan wore this ridiculous grimace throughout. And then there was the actual filming: take a mix of art-house creativity, mix in a bajillion Red Bulls and some premium catnip and you still won't approach the mental mess that they called a finished product. This is far from the worst film I've seen, and I like some of the action scenes with the Rider, but overall I cannot recommend this film to anyone in particular. 3/10",

I DID NOT see any 3D in this movie or maybe I might have missed it. I believe the fire I saw for more than half an hour must have confused my brain,sorry. I believe I say honest things about movies and I understand what hard work the creators have done to achieve any form of media art but If this is the direction Mark Neveldine & Brian Taylor decide to take, then I'm afraid they will quickly disappear into oblivion. Archive this one as 'The wake up call' and go back to the drawing board to paint fans something beautiful next time. This movie was an Epic fail in every category of film. There was NO++ character development, continuity, satisfying action scenes, interesting dialogue, cleverly set stunt set-pieces and No story.

So special effects have increased obviously the past few years, and if you're looking for a bunch of fire, smoke, and dust, then by all means, see this movie. But if you're looking for acting, dialog, and up to speed fight scenes, you're out of luck. Nicolas Cage is...Nicolas Cage. I'm not too fond of him and this movie did not increase our relationship at all. Luckily, the child actor in the movie was not that much of an annoyance. The main girl was hot, and the main villain was okay at best. But Nicolas Cage should not have been this role. As is to come in many of Nicolas Cage movies, there's awkward emphasis on all of the wrong words that turns a serious situation to hilarity. And there is a scene where he shoots a flame thrower out if his dick. This film at best is sub-par. It's a mockery of Marvel Comics and to Ghost Rider, and it was not worth me staying up till two in the morning to watch. 5/10 at best. Try to see it for free. Don't pay for this movie.P.S. There was only one actual fight scene that lasted all of two minutes. This ended up SPOILER with the main villain dying. (Big surprise) The way in which his death was portrayed was horrible. The effects sucked and it looked like they forgot to add in his death and then made the animation in twenty minutes.",

Nick cage was good in some movies, however this is the worst movie i have seen since The punisher.lets talk about the first ghost rider and things it did right. The look of the ghost rider was perfect from they way he stood too his movements. now i know some people didn't like the burning up there soul thing from the stare of the ghost rider, but anyone that has seen SOV (spirit of vengeance)know the horrible way they changed the look. in one scene the ghost rider and the bad guy stare at each other while the rider just makes this goofy screaming sound. NOTHING happens they just stare for a good 2 minutes. i sat in the crowd waiting for some new cool looking effect to take place and show there on sins turned against them. instead there isn't any effects at all beyond the look of the rider. Hellfire which is what the rider is consumed of, which in the first movie they fire moved a lot and burned insanely, the new rider looks like a candle...a peaceful candle. The chain attacks decent i cant say too bad about them, the fact they would just burst into ashes was kinda boring though, they was no cool combat scenes just him swing about a chain and everyone instantly dieing. Now the thing that makes the rider, the bike this being the most important part about the rider, they messed it up so bad that it annoyed me to see him ride. first the tires was on fire not made of fire like they was meant to be. he didn't rider the chopper they he always supposed to be riding the same bike. the movement of the bike seemed SLOW the rider is supposed to be able to move faster then any man made machine however he had a hard time catching up with a ugly suv. as the rider rides he is supposed to leave a trail of flame instead he is trailed by nothing but black smoke like a diesel flooding out. so instead of the cool lookin flames we get a look of a car that burns more oil then gas. Now do you wanna see the movie? with a ghost rider that moves slow, long points of staring at each other with no effects? ill keep going, in this movie whatever the rides turns into flame a machine used to dig he jumps on, it of course is consumed with hellfire. it was cool looking, but there was soooo much fire and explosions that i couldn't even see what was going on, i just seen it smashing houses not people. the lines were one liners and cheesy puns, nothing but child humor and video game dialog. even the villain named carrington, he was supposed to have the power of decay, he was pasty looking with black vines. his ability was weak, the combat was with black background and him jumping from guy to guy dispatching. i don't know how it turns pitch black in the middle of the day and him with the ability to hide in the dark. blaze wants to get rid of the curse of the rider, so some random guy whom has no background given but played a high role in the movie blesses him and he passes out then it shows the rider spiting out chains, this symbols the rider being ejected NOT hellfire which is what he made of or any thing else that makes more sense but the chain that he carried as a weapon. i could keep going about the fact the story line similar to about 1000 movies. i want people to see this movie, so they might make another attempt to make another but its a waste of time. this officially needs a complete reboot with new actors and better writers and they would pick up the the director from the first movie at least he knew what it should look like, and get rid of the Marvel Knights who made punisher: warzone which was nothing but silence and violence with no story.",

The problem with such films is balance between opposing forces. For much of the film the supernatural hero is up against a hard-working mercenary who gets a boosts later on. Everyone else just falls over. That reminds me of Ultraviolet, a great film for watching people fall over. For a lesson in balancing forces, look at the hastily made 1974 film Enter The Streetfighter where you have a hierarchy of powerful characters, much like Top Trumps, and all introduced quickly and without much effort. There are some good visuals in Spirit of Vengeance. We'd regard the special effects department more if the other parts of the film were functioning. I feel sorry for Ciaran Hinds who was once Julius Caesar, an actor. I don't feel sorry for Christopher Lambert. He won't be tarnished by his part. The mythology is not deep enough for this character.

The film has it's moments where it's exciting and makes you smile but they are pretty much done in the first half hour, from then on it's disappointing.I'll admit that I was skeptical about viewing this as the Last few films I've seen Nick Cage in have quite frankly, rubbish, but being a lifelong Marvel fan, I saw it anyway. I was right about being skeptical, his performance for me, was appalling. The majority of the film is just like his other films, lots of close ups of his sweaty, dirt encrusted face whilst he pull that out of breath, worried looking expression. The plot was highly predictable and as always, all of the films good bits are covered in the commercials.The rest of the cast we're okay, Elbas French accent and stereotypical French behaviour became tedious and annoying after a while and Placido's performance had many errors, I mean how many mother's (especially one's who have just been trying to rescue their child) will sit there smiling whilst their young son sits on the handlebars of a motorcycle doing a wheelie at 50mph? Ridiculous.Unless you've seen the first Ghost Rider, this one isn't worth seeing, even then I wouldn't pay to see it. Maybe just wait for the T.V premier.All in all I'd give this 7/10 for visual effects but for the plot and cast performance 2/10. Such a waste of a film.",

Instead, the boss tells the guys to shoot Ghost Rider and for some reason Ghost Rider is unable to capture everyone or at least knock them down or kill them - because he wanted to concentrate what should have been his \"Penance Stare\" - when people feel the weight of their crimes - but instead is some form of soul sucking, and so the bad guys get away with the kid.Funny thing is, the kid is supposed to be the point of the Ghost Rider's search - so why did he essentially just stand there and watch everyone pile into a car and drive away with him? There's another point in the tale, earlier, where a \"business man\" finds the lady at a coffee shop somewhere...and because she's at a coffee shop he solicits her for sex...because any lady at a coffee shop is a prostitute.He took of his wedding ring as he noticed her staring, and then he asks her if she's a gypsy, because...he was leading to say gypsies are prostitutes.I'm not sure why people make awful films - Ghost Rider is actually a pretty great story, and it's already written and selling for about thirty years, now, so it's not like they couldn't have taken an episode from one of his comics if they so badly lack material - but this film is so awful I think an angel lost its' wings and there will be no Christmas for some because of it.So far, only the Iron Man and the Thor movies are anything like they should be, in comic world - and the Thor one was vandalized when they made up a love interest that wasn't the woman Thor has always had.I keep hoping Stan Lee will get mad and stop the madness...but, sadly, it has continued in a big way in this new ruin of a movie.I am struggling, in parting, to find some element that would be a \"plus\", some salvageable bit that would be an \"at least...\" to this tale...but there is none.",

It has the right look and feel in the comics (and the more recent graphic novels) that would translate beautifully onto the big screen. But yet again, they chose to give the mantle to Nicholas Cage, and he has managed to overact the film into mediocrity and beyond.For me, I felt that every single scene where it was Cage speaking or appearing on screen was just further rubbish until the Rider appeared. This is the same thing as the last film, just limping along, staggering through Cage's overacted, hammy lines and poor attempts at conveying an emotion other than \"cocky twit\" until the Rider appeared for a few minutes and we get a genuinely good sequence. And then, just as we start to enjoy it, we're back to Cage again.Other than Cage, pretty much everything else about this film was wrong. What comic were they following? There are plenty of fantastic stories that a Ghost Rider film could use (Road to Redemption, Trail of Tears etc) but no, we had to get an \"original\" story which bored the pants off me.I am a big fan of Ciaran Hinds, I think that in the right role he can be brilliant, especially as a bad guy (I actually thought he was good in Tomb Raider 2) but here, as the devil...NO!!! Peter Fonda was perfect, he actually had the look of Mephisto, but no, we had to change it. Add to that instantly forgettable performances from everyone else and soon the only thing that you can remember when you walk out of the cinema is the urge to vomit every time Nicholas Cage tried to act.Or maybe that's just me?",

            "content": "First of, the first film isn't a cinematic masterpiece either, but at least it had something of a decent, easy to follow storyline, smoking hot Eva Mendes, and the always awesome Sam Elliot.If you haven't seen the first film, in a nutshell, Johnny Blaze sells his soul to the devil to save his father, but that all backfires as he is eventually summoned by the devil (who is much better in this one than in Vengeance), to carry out the duty of finishing off Blackheart and his elemental demon allies. He runs into his old high school flame (Mendes), has to protect her from the demons but fails, gains the help from an old mentor/fellow \"Rider\" played by Sam Elliot (who provides the best part of the film), goes off and defeats Blackheart. Once his duty is done, he is given the choice to get his soul back, but chooses to use his demon powers to try and stop the devil from doing evil around the world. Overall, not a terrible movie, acting can be hokey but can be enjoyable at times, and scenes with Ghost Rider himself are actually pretty impressive at times. For my money, 7/10.But as for it's long awaited sequel, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance... just throws everything even remotely good about the first film and just replaces it all with bad writing, story, characters, and logic in realms of \"Ghost Rider\". I'll list off issues, first in the first film, the Ghost Rider only sought out to kill off the sinful on his own accord, but this one he'll be unleashed at the slightest presence of sin. And Blaze's character is now a paranoid, crazed man who cuts himself off from the world to keep the Rider at bay. And the rider himself, while his design is honestly good, isn't even nearly as cool as the first films version. The penance stare in the first film let you see all the sins of the sinner he is killing, and leaves their eyes looking like ashes. You don't even get that concept here, he just looks, roars, and they die. Wtf. About the only thing I liked in this sequel was his ability to make vehicles (including a crane and jeep) start flaming, but they don't undergo a bad-ass design change like his motorcycle in the first one (it looked all demonic skeletal while he rode it, but this one it just has flaming tires). And then, all the acting is either just has no/little effort put into it, or it just sucks overall. The overall concept of the story might have been a good premise, but it was so badly scripted that it just falls apart as you watch the film. One last thing, in the first film, the devil could not be touched by anybody, and here his ass get literally sent back to hell by the Rider (which is honestly the best scene in the film, but it just does not make sense if you even remember the first film.) All in all, the effects can be good, but promising concept destroyed by bad writing and crappy acting pretty much destroy this film as a whole for me. Maybe you'll enjoy it if you've already seen it but not the first one, but check out the original Ghost Rider, you might get something there you might like a lot more than this crap-fest.2/10 (and that's being nice).",

But this is coming from someone who made this comic popular, everyone who owns a Ghost Rider comic you made this series popular. And I feel its just as much ours as it is Marvel's. We sat through the first one watching amazing ideas like bringing in the Phantom Rider (the first Rider who was a cowboy he had a horse, whip, and revolver) and the Ghost Rider's awesome bike and I'll admit the Ghost Rider when he transforms is cool looking... but cool ideas don't mean anything if they are in a stupid, dull story full of horrible one dimensional characters who couldn't display a single human emotion if their life depended on it. And yes I hate Nick Cage now because of what he did to my favorite comic.Okay so clearly we hated the first one, fans aren't going to see the second. Oh but wait the trailer shows promising things... it shows the blue flamed rider who is a new rider in the comic. In the comic a person named Danny replaces Johnny Blaze (aka Nick Can't Act Cage) as the new Ghost Rider and Danny has blue flames, I see a character in the new movie who's name is Danny!! So I see the character name and blue flame Ghost Rider!!! They HAVE to be replacing Johnny now. Oh man and I see a REAL villain from the comic named Deathwatch who has the ability to steal life away from living things. Although he looks more like Blackout, but his powers are strength, agility, and light generating fields? Whatever NO MORE CAGE. And oh what's this?? Idris Elba is in this movie? He is a great actor.OH BUT WAIT NO **** FANS! Nick Cage turns out to be the blue Ghost Rider and is doing a horrible job at it, Danny is just some kid who's the son of the devil, Deathwatch and Blackout aren't in this movie, although it seems like they took the villain duo and merged them into one villain for the story (The villain in the movie looks like Blackout but with the power to decay sounds like sucking the life out something which would be Deathwatch's power) the Spirit of Vengeance (Who is supposed to be a REAL villain in the comics) is... Nick Cage too? **** YOU MARK NEVELDINE! And wait a minute they clearly made a story goof as well, in the first movie the Ghost Rider couldn't be transformed while in the sunlight or he would turn back to normal but in the second movie that just... goes away magically? This is a sequel right? Don't tell me this is supposed to be a remake and they cast Nick Cage again! The entire monologue in this beginning tells a story but not the same one from the first movie?!Every I time I say \"I'm a fan of Ghost Rider\" people are going to think back to these movies instead of the comics, and for that I will hate this movie and those who produced it for my entire life. Let people forget this tragic horror to the world of comics, no more sequels just let it die along with my childhood!!",

Lesson learned.The rating \"God awful, makes you want to gouge your eyeballs out with a spork, and either head-butt the TV or try to hit the cinema screen with projectile vomit.\" is not vivid enough to explain how bad this movie was... I would rather watch The Disaster Movie every day for a week straight then this horrible excuse of a movie.Sad to think the directors of movies such as Jonah Hex and Gamer stooped this low. Crank was terrible, all of them, but they seemed to be producing better movies. What a gross waste of 75 million dollars",

When I saw the movie for this trailer I knew the movie was going to majorly suck. First, the Ghost Rider doesn't look anything like he does in the first film. The Hellcycle looks like a remodeled POS unlike the sweet ride he had in the first film and I could tell the story line was weaker then the directing. I honestly don't know why Nicholas Cage ever agreed to do a sequel to this movie. In my opinion, if there was going to be a sequel, Mark Steven Johnson should have directed it. When he directed the first Ghost Rider movie, I was blown away by the look of the characters, the Hellcycle and even the story were very well done. I won't lie, this movie isn't worth watching. Watching paint dry is a lot more fun then this garbage. For you Marvel fans out there, DO NOT watch this movie. Believe me, you be saving money on aspirin. Because that's what this movie is.

            "content": "In 2007 we were given Ghost Rider, a superhero that has been widely considered to be one of the worst movies in the genre. I have not seen it mostly because I have not found it anywhere that I don't have to pay money for and if a superhero movie released in 2007 is considered worse then Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer then I don't think I could have the glimpse touch my eyes without opening my eyes out with tacks. I went into Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance with just about as little hype as I possibly could. I heard from many friends that this movie was bad so I decided to not see it in the movie theater, I watched on demand for free and hoped for a movie like Transformers where I could tell it was bad but I would enjoy it anyway. No, Ghost Rider 2 was nothing like that. I watched in awe at just how awful Ghost Rider 2 got. I cannot believe this movie was put out at all. The story is just silly. Johnny Blaze is hiding out in Eastern Europe and is called upon to stop the devil, who is trying to take human form. The form is that of a little kid, who just so happens to be his son. I do not understand how the devil could get any work done in transferring from a grown man to a bratty ten year old kid. Spirit of vengeance has exactly one good thing to it, Idris Elba. He actually looks like he is having fun but is obviously there just for a paycheck. Other then that the movie is just full of garbage. Not a SINGLE character is likable. The mother is annoying, the villains are some of the dumbest characters in film history, and the kid is quite possibly the worst kid in media since Carl from The Walking Dead. The camera shakes constantly almost as if they placed the camera on a paint mixer before rolling. Nicholas Cage overacts his lines to the nth degree. SOMEONE must have known that he was awful, I cannot imagine that anyone could possibly green light a performance like that. He is so bad I would almost recommend to watch it just to see him, but you can find the best parts on YouTube so there is no point. The editing is so bad as well. random scenes will just be cut into dialogue scenes especially one of Ghost Rider pissing fire. Also, they honestly expect you to buy the chemistry between this kid and Johnny Blaze. It could be the most awkward scene sharing in film history. Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is the worst movie I have seen since Jack & Jill. NOTHING in this movie works except Elba and that is only because he is always fun. I cannot believe this movie was not stopped by production because it is honestly a top contender with Transformers 2 as worst action movie ever. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone even if you are in the mood for a bad movie. Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is a worst superhero movie then Batman & Robin and is, without a doubt, the worst movie of 2012 so far.",

The style of the film is completely different to that of the first and relies almost entirely on special effects, even where they are not needed. There are many camera shots that are too short and quick for your brain to process what is in them and are therefore useless.The acting was moderate at best with Nicholas Cage doing his over the top acting and spoiling areas of the film. It is clear he is trying in this film, but way too hard! (And his cheesy lines, especially his last one, don't help!) The storyline however was OK and even though I had many questions as too why things didn't occur and I thought there were gaps in the plot, it kept me engaged at points, so much so that i did not leave the cinema.Overall I would suggest not going to watch it in the cinema (Especially in 3D, no point). Wait till it comes out on DVD and even then, borrow it from a friend or wait till it is only a few pound to buy.",

These little, cartoon-ish parts where you hear Nic Cage explaining everything about the movie? Unnecessary.Cage freaking out? Ridiculous one-liners by almost every single character? Awkward.It starts out fairly well, I must admit. That is, until a hot girl wearing makeup shows up. Wasn't she gonna fight the Devil himself? Who the hell needs makeup for that? Anyway. There's a boy that must be protected, for whatever reason. He's at this super fortress that's actually a church of some kind, I don't know. Lots of awful camera shots later, the \"impenetrable fortress\" is breached by a bunch of guys with guns. Alright.A while later, you see Nicolas Cage being asked by some french dude, whos called Moreau, to save that boy, who we see escaping the fortress with the hot girl with makeup. Turns out that the people who breached the fortress follow the two, and, as incompetent as every single villain in superhero movies are, they take so long to reach them, that, by the time they capture both, the Ghost Rider is already heading there. Now, I've read some stuff about him on Wikipedia, and apparently, he's one of the most powerful creatures in the whole world, of course something like a grenade launcher wouldn't stop him, right? Nope, it actually does. Later on, 2 Javelin missiles don't, but who cares anyway, right, Hollywood?OK, let's see. After that, there's some more meaningless action, with the most horrible camera work I've ever seen, and \"witty\" one-liners, like when the Rider throws a bad guy in front of a car and says \"Roadkill\". REALLY?Summarizing it all up: The humor shouldn't even be called humor in the first place; The effects are alright; The acting is ATROCIOUS; The actions scenes COULD have been good, but the camera and the lack of a steady pace makes them annoying (Not to mention, the Rider doesn't even find an enemy that stands any chance against him).Do NOT watch this",

Nicholas Cage is a waste of money who is unable to make the human aspects of the character remotely likable, leaving us longing for \"The Rider\" & special effects to take over.Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylors decision to push against the ending of the first part of the series where Johnny Blaze swears to use his power for good, to part two's Johnny Blaze trying to remove and suppress his curse was a severe let down. Enter Idris Elba, as our voice of reason, helping to coax the Ghost Rider et Johnny Blaze into a cause larger than himself. The story line filters along the same as the last film whereby the Devil himself is the main source of evil on Earth and \"hell-bent\" on a glorious reemergence, blah, blah, blah. Only one new character was developed to play opposite the good-evil Ghost Rider & so Johnny Whitworth was tapped to play \"Ray Carrigan\" a.k.a. Decay. The role was played adequately however never met expectations to really drive our hero from his all-powerful perch, or even stop him from using horribly clich\u00e9d lines, thus a lack-luster final battle.After this film the Ghost Rider Franchise is going to need a reboot. The obvious eventuality of the film is pretty clear mid-way through if not sooner but we watch because there are some extremely cool visuals all lit on fire.

Well this is not the case in SOV.First, GR spent a lot of time just kind of standing around and getting his ass kicked. I understand that has to do with building the hype to the point where when he finally does decide to use his power the crowd ooos and ahhhhs. But why? If it was that important why not make the bad guys....bad? At one point he gets shot with a grenade launcher twice and wakes up in the hospital in pain with healing injuries, yet at another point he is annihilated with a Javelin (Call of Duty style) and walks away with no discernible injuries.Next, there is the terrible acting contained in this movie. Even the good actors seem to have trouble coming across the big screen. But most notably there is Violante Placido (who plays Nadya). She seemed incapable of holding a single emotion for any length of time, other than the \"mouth breather\" face.Then there is the bad guy, who is imbued with the power to \"decay.\" Which when you think about it is a pretty cool power, but here it seems to work whenever it is convenient. I know that sounds weird, but you get the impression that he can not control it (e.g. has no choice when he starts to decay something), evidence by his attempt to eat a sandwich and an apple. However, at later points he touches things that do not decay at all, or decay at a slower pace.Overall, I think the movie had promise, but took a wrong turn when they spent too much time trying to insert comic reliefs, could not get a decent actress, and were themselves confused about the use of powers.",

            "content": "I bought this movie new on DVD at a resale outlet, and I only paid $1 for it as a result. However, the $1 cost was still too much as the storyline was very fragmented and hard to follow. The acting by the majority of the crew was also unconvincing, and the special effects overshadowed a poorly written plot.Accordingly, I can now understand why the Ghost Rider franchise is one of the rare few Marvel Comics movie franchises that Stan Lee has refused to make a cameo appearance in. I also understand why Eva Mendes turned down the opportunity to reprise her role from the previous installment. And while I didn't think that the first Ghost Rider movie was great, it was at least somewhat entertaining, and it was certainly much more watchable than this version. Hopefully, the producers will not decide to do a third Ghost Rider movie with Nicolas Cage in the starring role.Listen, Cage is an Academy Award winning actor whose talents I admire in numerous other roles, but he was never well-suited as a good fit for this specific role. Accordingly, perhaps the producers should either retire the Ghost Rider franchise completely, or they should consider doing a reboot with a different actor at the helm that is directed by a more skilled director with a successful track record. Some that come to mind include: Christoper Nolan (Batman Franchise), McG (Charlie's Angels), Bryan Singer (X-Men), or J.J. Abrams (Lost, Star Trek XI) to name a few. One of them could likely do a much better job on creating a more successful version of the Ghost Rider character, which is based on the comic books.Otherwise, it's very easy to understand why this movie received low ratings due to the lack of well known actors, the poorly written script that resulted in a disjointed/fragmented storyline, and the inability of Nicolas Cage to come across as believable in his dual role as Johnny Cage/The Ghost Rider character. Best wishes to all who watch this movie, and I look forward to a much better interpretation of the Ghost Rider character in the future, as this film severely fell short of the success that many other Marvel Comic book characters have experienced in theaters, once they were converted into films that fans enjoyed.",

Marvel might as well tried to script their own version of the Illuminati, which Cage was involved in, coincidentally.In the case of this film, I liked my friend's stories more. The image of a man on fire, able to wrangle in demons with a chain lit on fire, seemed better in mind than in my eyes. Quite honestly, the CGI was so transparent that it edged on \"Uck\" status.

When I say odd, its good but its about quality as you would expect from a good Youtube video. It seems like every scene in the sunlight is overly exposed and camera never holds still, it looks like someone is doing this on a hand held camera. Another thing to mention is the new look of the Ghost Rider himself which I have to say...Its not bad, just a different tone. The original film made his skull clean, sharp and white, the bike was a huge chopper with an awesome design and his jacket was nice tough clean leather that looked brand new each time. Having it be this way made him a lot more fun because he looked like a Marvel comic character come to life. In this version, his jacket is torn and beaten, the bike is dirty, dented and looks more like a Harley from hell, and his skull was almost black and scared. I say this ins't bad because even though it is a big change in comparison to the original, this is probably would be what a real Ghost rider would look like. This look made him a lot more evil and sinister making this one a bit more intimidating. He was more of an out of control monster from a horror film then a Marvel Comic. You even see him at one point actual send someone to hell, like literally, a giant hole opens up in the ground and someone is launched into the pits of hell. Besides that there isn't much to say about this film. Besides the action is was rather boring, almost none of the characters are likable, very forgettable and....no, this whole film is forgettable. I give it 4 out of 10 because even though it was boring, it could have been a lot worse. I would say watch it once for the fight scenes, but certainly don't buy it.",

            "content": "First of all I have to start by saying I loved the first Ghost Rider, but this one made me mad.3D: I thought this might be a good one to see in 3D, with chains flying in your face and things like that, but there was no point. In all the cities in my area they didn't even give you a choice of seeing it in 3D or not. If that's the case, there had better be a reason for 3D and it had better be good. There wasn't for this movie.Action sequences: I know a lot of films are doing this now, but I hate it when they jiggle the cameras around and flash quickly between close up shots of something that you can't identify and you have no idea what is going on. This is made worse by the 3D effect. I'm sure they think it's more realistic, like you're actually there, but the would be spectacular scene is lost. I'd be way more amazed if they zoomed out and kept the camera steady so we could actually see what was happening.Nicolas Cage: He was hardly in the film, and I don't just mean because he was computer generated half the time. Both Johnny and his alter ego Ghost Rider weren't there that much. There was more focus on the other characters and because it was only 1.5 hours long (which I think is too short for a marvel story) Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider didn't get enough air time.Appearance: I understand Ghost Rider has been going through hell and he's looking decrepit, but I was sad not to see the cool leather jacket with the spikes, tight leather pants, boots on the bike. His bike was looking pretty beat up too. Instead of cool and sexy, he was just plain blah. I didn't like how they did his transformation or how his skull looked either, sorry to say.Behavior: I guess it was because he's gone insane, but I didn't like how G.R. didn't really say anything. He just jerked his head like some kind of animal. He didn't point at people and pass his judgement: guilty or innocent. When he stared into a person's soul it just went on and on, the two of them staring at each other like they forgot to put in the clip showing all the person's past sins. Then the bad guy just turned to dust. It was completely unsatisfying when they didn't get their eyes burnt out by seeing all they'd done in the past. I also missed how G.R. would whip the chain around then wrap it over his shoulder.Story: The idea was good (the whole son of the devil thing) but they didn't use it to its full potential. (Again the 1.5 hour length didn't leave them much time.) I didn't like how they redid the back story of him making a deal with the devil and changed it. (This also ate up Nicholas Cage's and this story's air time.) I wished they'd shown more of what's been happening to Blaze since the last film as well.Things that didn't make sense: Maybe I missed something when I watched it in the theatre, but I don't understand how G.R. gets blown up by a grenade and ends up in the hospital then later gets hit by a bazooka and it doesn't bother him one bit. (I'm sure there were other thing's that didn't make sense, but it's been a while since I saw it, so I don't remember them now.) The Devil: I wish Peter Fonda had reprized his role.In the end I think you still should at least see this movie if you were a fan of the first one. I just warn you that you will be frustrated and probably angered by parts of it. I do really hope they make another one just so they can make it better than this one and give the fans some satisfaction, which in this case shouldn't be hard after this.",

The first shot of the Ghost rider just keeps cutting to him standing there and slightly moving his head one way and another, then cuts to bad guys watching him then him again moving his head slightly. What the heck? You get into a fight with bad guys run them off the road and then just stand around posing for a teen heart throb photo shoot for the next 10 minutes? Then when he finally moves (there's about 10 bad guys)He just grabs one and we have a four minute close up of him staring at him doing nothing. Giving other bad guys all the time in the world to organise a devastating attack and escape. This is so unrealistic and trite it ruins the tone of the entire film. I get from the comics this was supposed to be a soul stare, but they needed to add some special effects to show this, on film it didn't look like anything was happening and just looked meaningless and idiotic. This then set the tone for a what was a disappointing film. Nicolas Cage did some fantastic acting, but the action was stunted with pointless pauses (if you're going to keep pausing the action for soul stares, then you need something to show that a soul stare is taking place), the plot holes were enormous chasm's, the Ghost Rider under used and made to look stupid. The best bit of the film was the dialogue from Moreau (Idris Elba) Again tellingly the bad guy was too under done. No sense of menace, no presence, and at no point did it make you feel as though the bad guy could have succeeded even if his only protagonist was Maggie from the Simpsons. (mind you in the 500th episode she kicked butt more convincingly than Ghost Rider did in this film.) This could have been a great film it wasn't. The Ghost Rider was under used, and then mainly just stood round and looked pretty. The soul stare, used a few time, just looked like four minutes of pointlessly looking into the bad guys eyes like a teen romance flick. It needed a special effect adding to show it was doing \"something\". And without doubt, Ghost Rider needs a menacing protagonist. A bad guy who has presence and menace, without that this could only ever be disappointing.",

I don't want to give any spoilers away as there are none as there is no sensible plot. Some devil is good or bad and he rides around on a motorcycle and burns people up. Great. Now this movie has just wasted 85 minutes of my life.",

So I was not disappointed with any of that, even though there was plenty. There was a lot of action with fire, gunfights and explosions. There were a few witty lines and some good effects and times of comic book fun. But I hate the way it was shot. There was some split screen stuff I didn't like, and the picture would jump around in a way I found unpleasant, some fast camera moves that didn't make things easier to follow, and several shots that you could tell were there simply for the 3D effect and I hate when a film does that (and I saw it in 2D so the shots were even worse.) If you are a huge Ghost Rider fan or in love with Nicholas Cage go ahead and see this one, just don't expect too much. If you are neither of those I wouldn't bother.",

This movie is near to be a Marilyn Mason's video (excuse me, are much better any Marilyn Mason's videos than this - I needed a comparission). I always thought that David S. Goyer is good if he respect a good comic saga, i.e: If you read the amazing job of Frank Miller in Batman we found the core of the Nolan's Trilogy. The way of Batman's Trilogy is a solid concept of Anarchy, splitted in three points of view... But in this case, Ghost Rider was destroyed and I.M.O is impossible to forget the way was showed us. My only wish is for Marvel, don't dig on the past... Keep walking from Iron Man to Avengers' success chemistry.",

The overall acting in this movie was very \"B'. And that statement goes for Nicholas Cage's performance, in fact I would have to say this was one of his worst performances. To me, it felt like he was bringing himself down to the other actors levels, or perhaps the directors wanted this \"cheesy B movie\" feeling and he and the other actors accommodated, I am not sure honestly. But no matter the reason, the overall feel of this movie was just \"B\" at best.What I do know is that after the movie, my son mentioned to me that he really wanted to just get up and leave after the first twenty minutes or so, and I laughed. And the reason I laughed is because I had thought the same thing, but had not verbalized that thought to him during the movie. Had I, and he told me he felt the same way, I would have actually gone up to the movie manager and asked for a refund, which would have been the very first time I had ever done that due to just not liking a movie.Don't waste your time and money on this one, it is not worth it. And most especially not worth the extra charge due to it being a 3d movie.Mediocre acting, mediocre special effects and just an all around bad movie. Very sad, because I did like the first one.

With the works of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor the directors of Crank 1 and 2 they succeeded in making one of the most awesome marvel characters ''Jonny Blaze''(Ghost Rider)a laughing stock for all to see, the entire film was nothing more than a complete joke. Put that with Nicolas Cage's acting and Spirit of Vengeance was born, how Cage is an a established actor as he is, is beyond me. The films intention to be a Dark and Ominous superhero action film like we saw in the trailer is pathetic thanks to Cage's inability to perform no other character than the same erratic bizarre character we see him play in all his movies. Also with the excessive amount of CGI and special effects and terrible one liner's such as ''Roadkill'' makes it even harder to take this film seriously. Overall I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone unless they wanted to laugh at its complete lack of potential and would strongly recommend that it's by far the worst film made in 2012 up to now.",

            "content": "This movie came out over 10 years ago now, and I remember being excited to see it in the theatres because I thought the first Ghost Rider was fun in a super campy kind of way. I remember sitting there watching it and the tonal changes were borderline shocking. It has the eclectic, spastic, shaky cam style you expect from the directors of Crank, while also utilizing their strange style of campy over the top humor. It didn't work for me back then, but upon rewatching it now in 2023 I was shocked at how much I really enjoyed the movie. I think it just needed to age and find a time for appreciation in a world so over saturated with direct to streaming schlock that even the worst movies from before the Netflix/Prime/Hulu/etc age seem more enjoyable. It's a darker film than the first in a lot of ways, as was the goal of the Marvel Knights banner (which only produced one other film, Punisher War Zone) and it left a lot of gaps in the storyline for the viewer to fill in on their own, including wondering who the villain with the white hair was supposed to be (he was Blackout, by the way) and why there was this weird fish eye lens and darkness when he was on the attack. But now, watching it again, I didn't find myself asking those questions. I found myself really enjoying it for what it is. A bad movie that finally aged to the point where it's become good, in a bad way. The ghost rider transformations are never shown in the entirety, but the scene on the motorcycle where Johnny is fighting it off and it's coming in spurts was one of my favorite scenes in the film. The damsel in distress was one dimensional yet again. And Cage employs his Face/Off over the top insanity to his best effect. Overall, it's a film I truly believe will have a cult following as there is an unfortunate lack of Ghost Rider adaptations out there and this one is a lot of fun. There are also fun cameos by Christopher Lambert and Idris Elba (who has a little more than a cameo but is still under used.)",

            "content": "I've been following the rumors of a Ghost Rider sequel since I saw the first Ghost Rider, which I thought was decent, had a good origin story, action scenes and proper character development. When I found out that the sequel was going to be helmed by Neveldine/Taylor, I freaked out. I saw Gamer and both Crank movies, and was not surprised, and I saw how the potential of a great actor, such as Gerard Butler, get wasted. I read some reviews about the way they filmed movies as daredevils and thought it could be awesome, but for Ghost Rider: Spirit Of Vengeance didn't seem to work. Towards the beginning of the movie, I was getting dizzy from all the camera changes, zooms and and twists.Then I started reading from their approach to the character. I read that they wanted to change the appearance from the first film, and to be honest, I thought it was OK from the first film. The melted jacket, the black skull, and the new motorcycle just didn't seem to work for me. I thought the looks were horrible, and I hated the motorcycle in this movie. The extra abilities of the Hellcycle, such as defying gravity or riding through water were absent. One of the most enjoyable things from the first movie was the sound of the motorcycle and the light motorcycle band approach. Also, in this movie, Johnny Blaze seems like a complete different character. He's just a crazy guy running, doesn't seem to be brace or that he would like to do stunts anymore even so he's been doing stunts since he was a kid with his dad.First off, if you want to make a film about a comic-book character, you need to do some proper research. I was amazed when I learned that they didn't even researched who Blackout was. In this movie, Blackout is only seen as a thug, not like a main villain or someone strong enough to meet GR's match. Also, Blackout is NOTHING like his comic-book counterpart. You can read it at Marvel or even at Wikipedia. They even forgot what being loyal to the comics is all about.About the Ghost Rider himself: there was never any clue or hint about him using the Penance Stare. There are some scenes where he fights some guys and NONE of 'em are even afraid they are seeing a flaming skeleton with a chain. Did I say chain? Yeah, the chain. That mystical chain just seemed like a rope. It didn't even flame up and it appeared magically when he changed to GR. The shotgun was missing too, and it's another of the GR weapons. Also, they try to make GR a hero. HE'S NOT A HERO. He's an anti-hero, but besides that, he barely even speaks and in this movie he is seen like a beast let off leash, much like Hulk. In the end of the first movie, we can see that he has some moderate control over his powers and that he can go flaming inferno at will without suffering some pain. I expected after the second change for him to have a personality. In the first film, we can see he judges people over being guilty or not. In here he just swoops in and kills people... NOT like he should. I also think Nick Cage's performance was awful. He's a good actor, but he screwed this film. All I saw was GR or Nick doing crazy stuff with bad acting. The film lacked a lot of character development and had a lot of misplaced humor. I thought the pissing scene and the Twinkie scene were really immature and unnecessary.I was really disappointed with this movie, having believed that it had the potential to beat its predecessor, but I was mistaken... gravely mistaken. Congratulations, Neveldine/Taylor. You ruined what could have a been a great franchise. People think that visual effects make a movie and they are wroooong. This movie had some, but had a weak story, few characters, no love interest and crappy acting. I think the best part of the movie was Idris Elba. Besides that, the popcorn. GR 1 is way better, not the best Marvel film, but a decent film. If you want to go see it, go ahead, but you have been warned. Also, don't waste your money in 3D. It's grotesque.",

This movie could have been much better and possible made room for more but Nick Cage has made sure there will probably never be another GR. I will have to say that Nicolas Cage is the reason this movie is bad, his take on the Ghost Rider as a lunatic and a merciless killing machine I do not believe to be in-tune with Johnny Blaze from the comic books, or in line with the representation of him in the first movie. When Cage is being a human is acting is on par with the other in the film but when he is struggling with the inner rider or actually being the rider it is almost too hard to watch. I found myself hoping that he would not transform just so I could finish the movie.The penetant stare in this movie is just stupid, not to mention that the one person he really stares down then turns to ash, so whats the point. If interested rent it for a dollar but don't expect much. And I hope that never make another one.",

I was hoping for a similar style of plot with a better bad guy, the bad guy in this was just rubbish, bad character, bad acting, bad dialog, a theme for the film in my opinion. I like Nic Cage and most of his movies but found his acting a bit shady as was the storyline. The end of the first film left a wide opening for a sequel which looked promising as did the trailer for this one but on the whole its a let down. I won't spoil the film if you want to watch it but I will say that the first film is better, the bike is better, the rider is better and the storyline is better. My advice would be to watch ghost rider the directors cut instead.",

There was one point in the movie were the main character spent a good 3 standing in one spot and screaming, after spending another three minutes dancing while the bad guys stared at him, achieving absolutely nothing.The choreography in the fight scenes was pathetic. A repetitive cycle of a bad guy shooting at the main character and not harming him, then the main character lashing out with his chain, touching the bad guy, and then the bad guy instantly dying. There was no motion, no flair and the end result was it being boring as hell to watch.All up, this movie would have fared better if they just completely took all the supernatural parts out of it and just treated it as a straight up action/thriller film. Utterly abysmal 2/10.",

This one, bad animation, bad special effects, bad story and come on Nicolas, you let the director away with how he wanted you to act??? Should have stuck with Mark Steven Johnson, the first movie had action and humour, this one needed a 5 min explanation on what happened previously, I guess to explain the changes to the story line and explaining how the devil can change appearance might have worked if you showed the original in the beginning.

Granted the first movie was extremely flawed this movie makes the original look like a masterpiece of cinema. It was clear the creators gave a care in the world and at least tried with the first one. In the original they messed up Meiphesto's name by calling him Mephistopheles. But that was at least what his name and character were based on, the character from Faust. In this movie he is referred to as Roark. Why I have no idea. SPOILER in the first scene with ghost rider he gets beat up by and loses to random thugs SPOILER ENDS thats how pathetic they make the spirit of vengeance in this film. Blackout is nothing like he is in the comics. There's a child actor who has a major role who can't act. Zarathos is totally wrong.

I also think johnny's regret for selfishly trying to prevent his fathers death parallels the torment the angel has, and by johnny accepting his curse as a blessing instead, they both can individually develop as characters.

One of the worst movies I have ever seen...worse than those deliberately-bad Tarantino exploitation flicks...it's like the director was high on crack...and all the actors, too... Nick Cage overacted it to hell, for validity, I guess...apparently the new director was telling Cage to play Johnny Blaze like a neurotic, psychotic crack fiend, maybe even sending him home with a big bag o' crack to help Cage stay in character. I rented this one from Redbox--for a dollar. It's hard to make a movie that's not worth renting for $1, so I guess they should be really proud of themselves for making this huge pile. I quit watching this POS 30 mins. in, and I won't ever pick it up again...I couldn't be paid to watch this film...it's that bad. No plot, horrible characters...the kid at the center of the 'story', is not only NOT likable, but basically Damien, or the Antichrist of some sort... It's like SOMEBODY had enough money to BUY the character to make this movie, hoping to absolutely ruin the entire series. The 'Rider's skull has been elongated like one of the aliens in the last (hopefully) Indiana Jones movie, and--instead of fighting during his first appearance--he pops and locks like Dave Chappelle's crack-smoking character Tyrone Biggums...Cage now plays Jonny like some twisted lunatic--I don't know how he read this and didn't threaten to quit the set...maybe he needs the money for his own crack habit. Johnny Blaze is no longer the 'Jeckyl & Hyde' character who fights his own demons--he plays it as if he's given completely over to 'the madness', gloating and threatening everyone in this dog-of-a-film. The female actor (you ARE kidding--her name means 'Violent Peace'--what a hippie!) is much worse, acting like she is doing some kind of soft- porn international art nuveau film...again, just awful. Gone are the days of any good characters for Cage, I suppose...would any actor these days stop production and threaten to walk off if they were expected to go along with this? We can only hope. Comparing this comic book hero movie to the latest Iron Man movies (w/ Robert Downey Jr.) is like comparing a Triple Crown winner to a dog wiping his butt on a cheap throw rug. Horrible...all involved parties should be sued for 'character assassination' (that character being the 'Ghost Rider').",

I didn't understand anything that was happening until the last half hour of the film. Besides, the plot was poorly constructed. Too many clich\u00e9s... This was my understanding of the events in the movie before I understood what was going on: There's a woman and her son who are being chased by two bad dudes for no reason...? Johnny just kind of...shows up. He still has the Ghost Rider's power, but he's very bad now and can't control the curse. So he just kind of runs around, killing anyone he can get his hands on. Johnny meets the woman and her son. Son gets kidnapped and taken to sacred place. This is when I finally discovered that the whole plot was about the devil possessing a human body (or was it?). But then Johnny jumps in and saves the day... ...What? I did like the darker version of the Ghost Rider, though. But overall the movie was a mess.

What's with the cinematography, when the power of decay attacks? the screen becomes blur with shaky camera, like the makers are pulling a cheap knock off. It showed lack of resource or interest for a better graphics. I would say, the makers went thrifty with the special effects. While the ghost rider made it's mark, this just merely made a scratch.

            "content": "MINOR to MILD USE OF SPOILERS My first review, yay. Before we start I need to make it clear, I haven't read the comic books, only saw the movies, so here we go. First I have to say, good cast for the movie, not great overall but still good, experienced, hell, Christopher Lambert is one of my favorites. This brings us to next part, character development, there just isn't any. Although we know Ghost Rider from the first movie, they wanted to go a little deeper into his character this time but failed at that, they wanted to change Johnny B behavior and make him a drug addict fighting his own demons, failed at that too, trying to make him look comedic at times, oh failing at that also. Benedict and Methodius, playing key roles for the intro and half point in the movie didn't get much of screen time to understand their actions but rather just to know them. The devil, at the end, was portrayed as a really dumb character, not good for a movie, especially for someone who's been around as much as him. Only character that I liked was Moreau and that's it. Story line, really messed up, many contradictions to the first film, Ghost Rider was supposed to be some angel/demon who inhibits a body of a person, through which he punishes the evil and saves the good, but how would both Carter Slade and Johnny Blaze, from the first movie, have the same demon in them if the demon is one entity. Taking a sole of a wicked person by looking him in the eyes takes forever or doesn't happen at all, it's like they have an intimate moment for 5 minutes, only soft music needs to come into background. That was really annoying, speaking of annoying, nobody seems to fear the flaming skull, they just look at him like some idiots, if it was me, I would run, and I mean run. Although I could see the story as decent, it was played very poorly. Dialogue, many clich\u00e9s, many heard stuff before, many useless words, no break trough here. Camera work, not bad, no wild shots. CGI, not as good as the first movie, and they did a little cut backs, such as no flaming chains, barely flaming skull, at one time there was time freeze as GR was floating in the air, no idea what was with that, random entry into a machine turning it into flames, no reason why, but CGI was good. And Soundtrack, good music, have nothing to say more on that. OVERALL: Actors 1/1; Character development 0/2; Story line 1/2; Dialogue 0/2; Camera work 1/1; CGI 1/1; Soundtrack 1/1;BONUS(my personal feel to it +1/-1) -1It seem they have done with Spirit of Vengeance to Ghost Rider what they did with War Zone to Punisher and that is turn a good base for further development of the movie in to a comedic, eye tearing anguish, suitable to watch only by children. Thank you for reading my little piece of mind :)",

Marvel has been on a role lately beginning with Ironman and continuing through The Avengers (in my opinion, the greatest superhero movie ever). Having said that, I was greatly disappointed with Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance.Instead of a movie on par with Ironman, Thor, or even the Incredible Hulk we were left with something more akin to Ang Lee's Hulk. What a nightmare that was! This movie had it all. Over acting, a bad script, and a director that decided the art house route was the best way to go. In many ways this film completely ignored the ground work laid in the first movie. Nicholas Cage didn't portray the Rider as tortured. He played him as insane. I found myself not caring about any of the characters in this movie. The only saving grace was the special effects. But one right doesn't fix multiple wrongs.Don't waste your time or your money on this dud. Here's hoping that the powers that be at Marvel and Disney put Ghost Rider in more capable hands.",

            "content": "A miserable, soulless sequel to a heartfelt adventure.\n\nDirectors Brian Taylor and Mark Neveldine's comic book thriller Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2011) really ruined any interest I had gained from loving Mark Steven Johnson's original Ghost Rider. Gone is Johnson's moody atmosphere and pleasant humor. Instead Taylor and Neveldine shoot everything during the day and it ruins any dark feeling for Ghost Rider, let alone the complete lack of any humor or character drama. This is truly a bargain bin movie. The budget is clearly lower as the practical effects are mostly gone and everything is hideous CGI and awful lighting. The goofy animated transition sequences are pretty amateur and the CGI looks worse than the first movie. Writer David S. Goyer's Antichrist storyline is tired and boring with every cliche imaginable. Screenplay writers Seth Hoffman and Scott M. Gimple writes corny, unfunny jokes with terrible dialogue. Everything is exposition instead of natural conversations. I hate this movie.\n\nNicolas Cage is given nothing to do or say as Johnny Blaze. He tries to be heartfelt, but there's nothing he can do, but act insane. He overacts this weird twitchy because suddenly being Ghost Rider is painful unlike before. I just thought all the cool moments were when he was Ghost Rider with the flaming skull. They barely even gave him skeleton hands except for one scene. I loathe the retconned flashback with Ionut Cristian Lefter as Young Johnny Blaze. Why show up Ghost Rider's origins, but different? Johnny Whitworth is awful as the bad guy henchman Ray Carrigan. He delivers lines like he's on a television show. He also looks like an uglier young Kurt Russell. His decay powers as Blackout were boring and the darkness abilities barely did anything. Fergus Riordan is annoying as the kid Danny Ketch. He's always angry and dismissive, so his character is just obnoxious.\n\nThey could not even get Peter Fonda back as Mephistopheles. His portrayal of The Devil was fun and scary. Ciar\u00e1n Hinds is strange and not scary as The Devil, now called Roarke for no reason. Violante Placido is given nothing to do as Danny's Romani mother Nadya Ketch. We know hardly anything about her and she does next to nothing but be suspicious. She looks like they could not get Asia Argento for this, so Violante will have to do. She is very pretty though. Idris Elba is phoning in his performance as Moreau. A secret religious society priest or something, who likes to drink and shoot guns. All the other characters are basically just stunt men. \n\nBrian Berdan's annoying editing style has all these jerky cuts that never cease. It pulls you out of the movie every time, so Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance feels like 3 hours even though it is only 96 minutes. Brandon Trost's cinematography is basically all shaky camera in wide shots. The camera never stops moving and every single scene looks like it was shot by the stunt team's co-ordinator in 20 minutes. I hate the visual look of this horrendous sequel. Kevin Phipps' production design looks like they found a few ruins and made cheap tv quality sets that are ugly and plain. Dominic Capon's set decoration is so sparse, it's like why did they even bother?\n\nComposer David Sardy's score tries to one up the original with the rock and metal noises incorporated with the symphonic elements, but it's just loud and annoying this time. There's only like two cool rock tracks that even standout. They either needed a bigger score or way more metal songs that fit Ghost Rider's aesthetic. Bojana Nikitovi\u0107's costumes for all the people look just like whatever they had lying around. I hate the charred black leather jacket for Ghost Rider and his burned bike as they both looked cooler in the first movie.\n\nIn short, skip Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance and just stick with the first movie Ghost Rider. I'll always wonder how this turned out so horrible compared to the humorous, cool, and exciting thrills of Ghost Rider.",

And the way it began I was even convinced that it's gonna be better. Turns out this one is even worse.\n\nYou gotta give them this one - the CGI flame on Ghost Rider now looks a lot more believable. But the VFX of anything else is terrible. Occasionally the movie uses weird emboss and black-and-white effect as if it's a Bollywood movie. It seemed as though the editors had just got After Effects and they wanted to add every effect they could find.\n\nThe story has no connection with the first film whatsoever. They even get the recap wrong! It shows that Johnny fell to the Devil's feet and cut his finger intentionally to sign the contract, while in reality the Devil had come to his tent when he was repairing his bike, and his finger accidentally got cut and the blood fell on the contract. The setting also doesn't make any sense. Johnny moved to Middle East because he didn't want to hurt anyone. But that's literally what he does there also. And in spite of being set in Middle East they don't show anything related to Middle East throughout the movie.\n\nThe acting continues to hold the same momentum as the prequel, by which I mean the same campy overacting. At least this time Johnny doesn't point at people and say \"You!\". Instead in the end he said \"Hell yes.\" after pushing the Devil back in hell.\n\nI'm really grateful that this series didn't have a third movie. Ghost Rider needs to be a grim, gritty movie with a lot of violence and heavy metal music, not this campy film series. Because no matter what you say, I can never take Nicolas Cage seriously. He's a fusion of Govinda and Uday Chopra. And I can't consider that to be the demon hunting Ghost Rider.",

            "content": "I was ready for Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance to be a wild ride of insanity, because the directors are the type of guys who seem like they would take everything over the top. On occasion the movie certainly got wacky but it never locked in on that style for long. Whether it was studio meddling, the restrictions of a PG-13 rating, or general reluctance to push the envelope, the movie fell flat. It never settles in on a proper tone, because sometimes we watch Nicolas Cage unhinged like only he can do as he\u2019s half-transforming into the Ghost Rider, but other times we have serious conversations about destiny and regret. Often these two totally different styles of scenes will come one right after the next, or Nicolas Cage will go from 1 to 100 within a single shot. Sometimes the bad guys seem frightening and intimidating, and other times they come across as bumbling and goofy. Even the characters themselves don\u2019t have consistent personalities from one scene to the next (or even consistent accents in the case of Idris Elba.) I\u2019ve never been a big fan of Ghost Rider as a character, and Spirit of Vengeance did not help with that at all. Here they try to overcomplicate the origins of the Rider, probably in an attempt to explain why he\u2019s a good guy, but none of it makes sense anyways so I\u2019m not sure why they feel compelled to work so hard at justifying the character\u2019s existence. I was also surprised they added literally zero special effect in this film to his penance stare, so it\u2019s just these long goofy shots where we see a CGI burning skull staring at an actor who is doing his best to look like something is happening to him. Meanwhile, we get a new villain that can magically make everything decay until he can\u2019t or doesn\u2019t want to for the convenience of the plot. It\u2019s all nonsense, and since the story lacks structure, I never felt a desire to try and comprehend what was happening. While a few of the visual effects were fun, and they used some interesting shot selection in the action scenes, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is still a bad film that actually managed to be worse than the origin story.",

Cage is completely unhinged without any sort of guidance.

The action sequences are better, the Ghost Rider is better utilized, if only because the shorter runtime creates the illusion that he has more screen time than he actually has and Nicolas Cage is having more fun with his performance this time around. But does that make it a good movie in its own right? The star rating has already answered that question. The CGI, while not terrible, has a more uneven look, compared to the first film. The story and script are rather generic and not wholly original. In fact, they even put in 3 animated sequences done in a comic book style to cut corners. I love those types of sequences in films but here, they feel like they're mostly there in an attempt to keep your attention. Though considering that the directors were also writers on Jonah Hex, a comic book movie on par with the first Ghost Rider film, to say the least, maybe I shouldn't have been surprised. There are some rather bizarre things in this movie that have to be seen to be believed. Ghost Rider peeing fire and 2 instances of Johnny Blaze v Ghost Rider that's edited like a '90s/ early 2000's heavy metal music video. Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is so bad, it's good but I'd rather take a movie that embraces that rather than the first film's more boring, slow-paced nature.",

The script comes from David Goyer of Blade and Dark Knight theme, but then they got the directors of crank to create it and those two creative forces don't feel like a particularly good fit. It feels like you can tell where David Goyer is trying to write this movie with biblical types and symbolisms, and then the guys from crank are like \"And let's have ghost riders start peeing\". The movie starts and closes energetic enough, but the middle section slows to a halt when they go and visit some monks. I feel like this movie could have been quite a bit better in the hands of a different director, probably a more horror based director, but as is this movie feels like eating ice cream covered in ketchup.\n",

The action sequences were also top notch. However, the bad is a mix of what is bad about film-making in general and the unmet expectations of comic book lovers for Marvel Knight characters in general. Ghost Rider is a pseudo interesting character to begin with. In theory, he should make a bad-ass film protagonist. In reality, he's great in action and graphically, but even Goyer's writing skills can't make him that interesting. Like the abysmal attempts at getting a good Punisher on film, the reality is, the Marvel Knights characters will never make interesting films as long as the focus is on the violent part of their characters rather than what makes them dark in the first place. So, in the long line of poor attempts, GRSOV ranks higher than Punisher: War Zone, Dolph Lundgren's Punisher and the original GR, but that's about it. I truly hope there isn't a third.",

The camerawork is so annoyingly and constantly shaky throughout the entire film. The story is god-awful. The cinematography is horrendous. THIS MOVIE HAS THE WORST CINEMATOGRAPHY EVER. The cinematography is so horrendous that it makes the action scenes dull and hard to enjoy. This sequel is so horribly-directed and beyond boring. One of the most boring films in film history. I ALWAYS FALL ASLEEP WATCHING GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE.\n\nRating: 1.2/10",

The monastery falls under attack; Moreau tries to help the boy and his mother Nadya (Violante Placido) escape, but the distrusting mother shoots at Moreau and flees with her son. Moreau manages to distract the men chasing Danny and Nadya, but nearly dies in the process and loses them. He believes that only the Ghost Rider is capable of protecting the boy. He finds the Rider and seeks his help. The Ghost Rider - is a vengeful, fiery spirit who feeds on the evil of his victims and consumes the souls of sinners. No matter how small the infraction - anything from genocide to a white lie - the Rider does not differentiate. This drives Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) aka The Ghost Rider into hiding, fighting the evil spirit within him. Moreau finds him with some ease and convinces him to save the boy in exchange for his priesthood's ability to restore Johnny's soul and remove the Ghost Rider's curse forever... \n\nReviewers who viewed an early preview screening at the December 2011 Butt-Numb-A-Thon in Austin expressed negative reactions to the film. Two attendants said it was worse than the first Ghost Rider film, and one said that the sequel makes the first film \"look like The Dark Knight\" by comparison. Rotten Tomatoes consensus states: \"With a weak script, uneven CG work, and a Nicolas Cage performance so predictably loony it's no longer amusing, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance aims to be trashy fun but ends up as plain trash.\" \n\nThe first Ghost Rider movie was ok, not top notch, but ok despite Nicolas Cage being in his usual overdrive mode. But, to be honest \"Ghost Rider - Spirit of Vengeance\" looks like a poor Eastern Europe low budget production and the feeling of being a bad tv-film looms all over the film. The plot, the script, the acting, and the special effects are just poor. Nicolas Cage can\u00b4t play Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider, it\u00b4s a fact. He just fucks it up. Idris Elba seems lost and you just know when Christopher Lambert has a part it simply won\u00b4t be a film to remember and when a film is not screened in advance for critics you can figure out the end result by yourself. \"Ghost Rider - Spirit of Vengeance\" classifies as a pretty bad comic superhero production.",

I liked the first ghost rider movie and I thought this movie would sorta fix what the first movie did wrong but nope but one thing that stayed the same is ghost rider himself and how he kills people and his fiery on fire face with revenge but that's another question I have why does he have revenge, he's saving not his movie but some other random girls kid, like what, ghost rider didn't have to be in this movie but because he's the start and they can't come up with any good ideas, yeah Sony I'm talking to you, give all marvel rights you have to Disney, I forgot at the time this movie came out Disney didn't own marvel but now give them to Disney, Disney makes everything good except some pirates of the Caribbean movies but just give it to them. The plot / story was unoriginal, saving the kid from becoming something bad, was it even in the comics, I highly doubt it because that's the cheesiest plot ever.

This time we see Johnny Blaze traveling the world  around Eastern Europe taking refuge.  Until he is confronted by a Monk (Idris Elba) asking for his help in protecting a special young boy.  At first Blaze is unwilling until the monk explains to him that he can in fact get rid of his \"curse\".  The only catch is that Mephistopheles/The Devil (Cirian Hinds) wants him too.  So bad he even endows some of his power to bring about a new foe for the Rider to face.  Johnny learns that The Devil (going by the name of Roarke) is wanting to use this boy as a host to walk the earth and spread his will.  What Roarke doesn't know is that when the Ghost Rider is involved, nothing is that easy.\n\n(Review)\n\nThe definition of \u00e2??Sequel\u00e2?? states:  A published, broadcast, or recorded work that continues the story or develops the theme of an earlier one.  So, yes this is a sequel\u00e2?\u00a6 just checking.   Mark Neveldine & Brian Taylor tag team this effort in bringing Ghost Rider back to theatres.  You would think that two brains are better than one?  Not in this case.  Now, as far as a Ghost Rider \u00e2??movie\u00e2?? I liked this movie better than the first one.  Even with the lackluster critical acclaim it fit more of the Ghost Rider character than the earlier attempt.  Devoid of  the Elvis crap, and \u00e2??pointing at everything that moves\u00e2?? as well as Eva Mendes.  So, I can\u00e2??t give them fault in trying to resolve all the 2007 movies\u00e2?? faults.  They even decided to make Nic Cage do the physical acting for Ghost Rider this time around.  Look kids it\u00e2??s not Franken-Rider!! In trying to resolve these problems they've created some new ones.  Ooh, let's find out shall we?\n\nThe acting and actors themselves were a turnaround that was definitely welcomed.  Except for one Nicolas Cage-bot that hampered many scenes with his overacting and his uncomfortable exchanges with the other actors.  It was unexpected to see them cast him again but honestly it helps keep continuity in play but his second chance was wasted.  Examples may include but not limited to 1) The exchange with the nurse \u00e2??I\u00e2??m flirting\u00e2??.  2) The exchange with Nadya in the car \u00e2??The rider is gonna \u00e2?\u00a6 Come out!\u00e2??  3)  The exchange with the low life at the underground fight club \u00e2??Scrapin\u00e2?? at the door!, Scrapin\u00e2?? at the door!\u00e2??  and about 30-40 more small instances where you really question this guy\u00e2??s ability not only to act but to function in society.  I\u00e2??ll tell you though Moreau (Idris Elba) was the highlight of the movie for me.  Loved his acting and his character was great.  Ray Carrigan/Blackout (Johnny Whitworth) had to have gone to the Stephen Dorf acting school for lame side villains.  I can almost guarantee it.  Cirian Hinds (Roarke) plays his part as the Devil but doesn\u00e2??t stand out.\n\nThat brings up Roarke.  Why \u00e2??Roarke\u00e2???  I mean Mephisto, no wait... The Devil, Mephistopheles, Lord of Evil, Prince of Devils, Prince of Lies, Lord of the Lower Depths, Satan, Beelzebub, Maya, Lucifer, Nick Scratch, the Friend, Legion but he has never ever been called \u00e2??Roarke\u00e2??.  What, there wasn\u00e2??t enough name choice to choose from?  As far as Danny Ketch is concerned it seems like they (David S. Goyer) just wanted to use the name for fan-boy recognition.  Danny Ketch is the 3rd Ghost Rider in comic history.  He is not the following:  Son of Satan, a kid when Blaze meets him, Son to a woman name Nadya.  Blackout was a constant villain for Danny Ketch\u00e2??s Ghost Rider iteration in comics but that is another change that was made to fit into the story?  Somebody needs to proofread Goyer\u00e2??s work.  Ray Carrigan/Blackout was a gun-runner for Roarke and at death when Roarke imbues his mystical bad guy powers to him.  This gives Blackout the power of Darkness and Decay.  To find out more about the real Blackout character click here.  Blackout\u00e2??s comic book persona had the power of Darkness but this new \u00e2??Decay\u00e2?? thing is new to the character.  Probably added due to the Twinkie scene.\n\nThis movie had a certain \u00e2??grittiness\u00e2?? that is needed for the character.  I felt the cut scenes helped push the audience through giving them the knowledge needed to continue on.  I could have done without the over the top action camera movements.  I was glad to see Ghost Rider traveling the world as he has been known to do and it catches that same vibe of him running into situations based on his location.  Although, I did not feel that Ghost Rider needed to be \u00e2??Horror\u00e2?? movie flick type scary-guy.  Which is what I feel was the direction.  At moments it\u00e2??s pretty cool, but there is too much of it and it takes away from the character.  I loved all action scenes with GR and I wish he would have had more speaking lines.  \u00e2??Road-kill\u00e2??.  I also loved that they expanded more on Zarathos the Spirit of Vengeance.\n\nSo, on the whole it was better than the first for me.  Nic Cage needs to stop.  Before I end this I have a final question to the masterwork of David S. Goyer (Blade Trilogy, Batman Trilogy).  Does the Devil honestly need sedatives to make the boy relax?\n\nComic Book Movie Plus:  Idris Elba: Thor, The Losers - Nicholas Cage: Ghost Rider, Kick-Ass",

There are a few fight scenes, but they are so uneventful and slow they are actually boring. Even the special effects are well below par. Nicholas Cage is hard to buy as haunted stuntman and former wild-child. There is nothing stoic about him. The digital form if Ghost Rider is even flatter. At least, Idris Elba has some presence, but his role is limited as a supporting character. Things happen, but they are not exciting and there is no emotion or impact.

The action sequences were also top notch.  However, the bad is a mix of what is bad about film-making in general and the unmet expectations of comic book lovers for Marvel Knight characters in general.  Ghost Rider is a pseudo interesting character to begin with.  In theory, he should make a bad-ass film protagonist.  In reality, he's great in action and graphically, but even Goyer's writing skills can't make him that interesting. Like the abysmal attempts at getting a good Punisher on film, the reality is, the Marvel Knights characters will never make interesting films as long as the focus is on the violent part of their characters rather than what makes them dark in the first place.  So, in the long line of poor attempts, GRSOV ranks higher than Punisher: War Zone, Dolph Lundgren's Punisher and the original GR, but that's about it. I truly hope there isn't a third.",

I'll admit that there are a few minor areas in which the film improved over its predecessor. For instance, there aren't as many unbearable characters, and the special effects are slightly better. However, that doesn't make up for the film's shoddy writing, which, if you can believe it, is even worse the film's predecessor, to the point that the story constantly gets worse. It wouldn't be so bad if the writers knew how to handle the film's concept, which would have been decent if it weren't held back by incompetent writing, a lame script, and Nicholas Cage's signature bad acting. The fight scenes are okay, but they look poorly done. In fact, I can't help but think they were heavily neutered just to make the film more accessible, but it just ruins the movie and makes it harder for me to overlook the obvious writing problems. Given everything I just said, it's no wonder why Nicholas Cage doesn't want to be the Ghost Rider more, and abandoning the Ghost Rider franchise might just be the smartest move he's ever made.",

Both have the same faults, or even if they have different ones, the overall level of awfulness generated by them are in the same level. With that said, this stand-alone sequel has one or two cool things, but it's not worth it. The story didn't get any better or bigger, the characters are one-dimensional trash and the movie is not really all that fun, it's mostly a bore...you know, just like the first one.\n\nNicolas Cage does his classic rampage acting that was absent from the previous one, but appears only slightly (if you want to see him going all-out jam, better watch Face/Off) and when he is Ghost Rider, he's mostly acting all quiet and rather quick, so much that you can't catch a thing with your human eyes. It's basically drugs. And we shouldn't be surprised by that, as the director of this movie is the Neveldine & Taylor duo, who is known for the Crank movies starring Jason Statham. Those movies have the character needing some kind of element to be in full energy mode. That creates a lot of drug-inducing-like sequences, which the duo know how to do very well. They forgot to put the same effort and joy here in Spirit of Vengeance.\n\nThe more I think about it, this movie would have been a lot better if they used the style of the Crank movies. Just imagine: a Crank movie but with Nic Cage as Ghost Rider as the main character...that sounded like the craziest yet fittest idea ever. But all we got was trash, just poorly managed and directed trash.\n\nThe story is very thin, practically the whole plot can be written down in one poster tagline. The size is so little that makes the movie really nothing important. In fact, I tell you this: every time you go into a movie store and you see an empty shelve, IT'S NOT AN EMPTY SHELVE. Why? Because Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is there. Still don't see it? Well, it is there, but its importance and presence is so little that the eye can't see it, because our brain doesn't care about it and thus, it practically almost doesn't exist. So, remember, everytime there's an empty movie shelve, it's only because there's a Ghost Rider sequel DVD or Blu Ray right there.\n\nOverall, this movie is just as bad as the first one. For everything it improved from the first, it works it out with another mistake of its own. These movies are unimpressive and ridiculous. Simply watch The Avengers or the first Iron Man, and there's your Marvel Comics movie.",

Not that it's a great movie or anything (it isn't), but the director never even watched the first movie by the time filming was done. So you really can't call it a sequel. Maybe if it was technically referred to as a reboot, critics might see something else in it. But of course, in Hollywood a sequel to a bad movie has to be bad.

The story is basic and needs some more development but the 3D and action totally make up where the story doesn't. The Ghost Rider takes control of several vehicles and tears up location after location, one scene includes a giant quarry digger, it sets aflame and starts crushing bad guys and blowing stuff up taking down multiple enemies, and he also takes on a whole motorway full of the Devil's right hand men which ends up in more destruction. Spirit Of Vengeance shows what 3D can do at it's best alongside the wild camerawork from Neveldine and Taylor. Glass shatters, flames and cinders float out the screen in extreme force. It's just as fun as the first film, if not better, although I do miss Eva Mendes' presence but Spirit Of Vengeance works due to the choppy camerawork, fiery visuals, Nic Cage and some of the most wild 3D I've ever seen on film.",

The film floats around, with overlong action scenes and some confusing moments where you don't really understand what's going on.

Unfortunately for fools like me who paid to see it, this one isn't any better.\n\nThat said, \"Spirit of Vengeance\" isn't any worse either.  The light humor of the first film is replaced by strange and bizarre storytelling.  The plot is not engaging, the dialogue is juvenile, and the characters are one-dimensional.  The action is a step above the first film, but is still pretty bad.  What I can say I like about \"Spirit of Vengeance\" is that there is some interesting camera work and really impressive (but also not-so-impressive) visuals.  I especially like the nice touch added of Blaze's leather jacket bubbling from the heat.\n\nThe acting in this is bad all around.  Nicolas Cage's performance is just awful; far worse than the first.  His line-delivery is atrocious.  The other cast members are people you've never heard of and will never hear of again.  The only bright point is Idris Elba's character.  I always enjoy Idris Elba, and he makes the best of an otherwise poorly written character.\n\n\"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" is a film behind the times.  With \"The Avengers\" only months away, this film will quickly be forgotten.  \"Spirit of Vengeance\" takes a lot of pages from \"Jonah Hex's\" book (right down to the out-of-place animated scenes), and the results are predictably devastating.  This is a joyless film; the result of it taking itself too seriously.  As it turns out, Ghost Rider not only has the ability to suck the soul out of people...He can suck it out of films too.",

But you shouldn't be too harsh on Blaze for his hesitation, considering the last deal he made.  Still, he tries his best, or rather the Ghost Rider does, only to end up in a Romanian hospital.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, \"Ghost Rider:  Spirit of Vengeance\" is not very good cinema to say the least, what with its paying little attention to any form of logic.  Still, it has two great advantages over its lumbering predecessor; namely, a much simpler storyline and never taking itself seriously.  I mean you have to appreciate a movie as loopy as this that knows that it is loopy, is proud of its loopiness, even getting a tattoo that says 'loopy' on its right shoulder, with a patented Nicolas Cage performance to match.

This, unfortunately, is not the case with Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, the second installment in the Marvel hero film series starring Nicolas Cage in the title role. Now, Cage has never been famous for choosing good movies, but this one really takes the cake. No hyperbole here: There is not one good moment in this entire load of elephant shit. It's a film that qualifies for that criminally underused term: The anus of cinema.\r\n\r\nGhost Rider 2 makes literally no effort in terms of plot, but I will try to explain it anyway: A woman made a deal with the devil, in which she was saved from certain death, but impregnated with the devil's baby. Rosemary's Baby rip-offs aside, this is a horrendous and mind-bogglingly inept premise that should never have gotten past the brainstorming sessions. Nic Cage as the Ghost Rider himself isn't even onscreen that much, and he basically moves through the story without furthering the plot very much. It doesn't center around him at all. Which would be excusable if... you know... his name wasn't in the title.\r\n\r\nWhat kills this movie even more is the godawful dialogue. \"WERE YOU SENT BY THE DEVIL WHO WALKS THE EARTH?\" It's as if the movie's producers pulled a semi-psychotic homeless man with a tinfoil hat off the street and asked him to write a script for them. It absolutely reeks, not to mention the typically over-the-top Nic Cage performance. What differs his gimmicks here from his performance in Con Air or Face/Off is just the fact that the crazy act has gotten old. His freak outs feel manufactured and you can tell he's not putting his heart into it. Even for people who enjoy watching bad Nic Cage movies (and I know there are a lot of them out there), this is not worth the time or the energy. It's not even so-bad-it's-good, it's just bad. Also, the movie squanders the immense appeal and acting capability of Idris Elba, who probably regrets being in this thing immensely.\r\n\r\nWhat blew my mind, however, was the CGI. It was somehow worse than it was in the first one. You would think that a movie completely devoid of plot, character development, a coherent story, and good dialogue would at least offer up some creative visuals. But no, the movie struck out again here. When the Rider walked around, it was almost as if he was a claymation creation by Ray Harryhausen. It was jerky and poorly done, and I can't help but wonder why these effects were even approved. It's not like I care about bad CGI, but if you're banking the entire success of your franchise on stupid people watching it for the visuals, you'd better have some good fucking visuals.\r\n\r\nAnd, as is with any anus of cinema, plot holes simply ABOUND in this thing. For starters, there's a scene in which the Rider is knocked out by a simple RPG blast. Cage has to be rushed to the hospital and everything. Then, twenty minutes later in the movie, he is blown up by a Javelin surface-to-air missile, and he walks away perfectly fine. And of course, he is able to whip his chains around and disintegrate all the expendable bad guys, but when it comes to the main man? Naah, let him live, he couldn't possibly be any trouble later. FUUUCK, THIS MOVIE SUCKS!\r\n\r\nIt's hard to write an honest review of this thing without losing your mind over its decadent badness. Truly, this is a turkey on such an epic scale that it really has to be seen to be believed. The plot points are idiotic, the dialogue is mind-numbing, and the action is truly terrible. Also, the Rider is going up against some guy with the \"Power of decay.\" Whatever he touches starts to rot. GOOD HOLY FUCK. You might as well make a disaster movie about a drought! There are just so many scenes to rant about in this thing, I could go on all day. How about the time when the Devil 'programs' a kid by whispering something through a cell phone that somehow makes him impossible to track? That was fucking smart. Or maybe the fact that it takes a grand total of two minutes to start up the first action sequence? No redeeming value. AT. ALL.\r\n\r\nThe film technique is terrible also. For some reason, the DP chose to have some random cartoons that pop up throughout the film, and they're narrated by Nic Cage. Holy shit, that's just a monumentally bad decision. Also, whenever the decay guy touches someone, the camera focuses in on them, drowns out all the other sound, makes the background black, and turns everything fuzzy. This effect is even more annoying than JJ Abrams's lens flare. Oh, and the soundtrack is bad... but I suppose it's appropriately pulpy, obnoxious, and overdone for this movie.\r\n\r\nAltogether, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is truly a rare film. And we can thank the heavens for that. I suppose that, on a primordial level, this atrocious bird shit on the windshield of cinema could be called dumb fun... but never anything more. Nothing went right in the creation of this movie, but then again, maybe everything was supposed to go wrong. Because it sure looks as if audiences have gobbled up another heaping helping of CGI crap, horrible dialogue, bad acting, and anus-of-cinema-level plot holes. Bottom line: Never watch this. At least things like Battlefield Earth are worth watching to make fun of their badness. Ghost Rider 2 isn't even good for that. I rarely say this, but... I wish I had the two hours I spent on this movie back.",

The characters go allover the place for barely-explained reasons, the camera is constantly shaking and going crazy even at the most supposed calm scenes, and it seems that the editors loved to play around with the saturation and glare meters. Half the time there were all these incoherent colors just everywhere, green, orange, red, blue, coming from all directions and ultimately making no sense. The CG effects are much better than the first one though, and the battle scenes are way cooler, but it's simply not enough to save it in my eyes.

Also, I like Idris Elba (Monreau), plus seeing Christopher Lambert (Methodius) in this film was an added bonus! Aside from the senseless of the movie and obvious insanity of Cage's character (and I think this is where Cage also lost his mind in real life). The best part of this film was after Roarke turns Ray Carrigan (Johnny Whitworth) into one of his minions, Ray drives away in an ill-gotten ambulance and rifles through the slain driver's lunch. Everything Ray touches withers and rots because this is the power Roarke gave him-- the ambulance driver, a sandwich, an apple but when he grabs a Twinkie from the lunch box, it remains unphased, either because the plastic it's wrapped in is not biodegradable or because of urban legend that Twinkies don't expire....funny! But, I guess you had to be there. This movie was campy, crazy and a little stupid but surprisingly entertaining or maybe it was just the Twinkie scene or it's just me.",

One such scene is the last fight sequence between Blaze and Carrigan. It seems to be quite well choreographed until the ending.

            "content": "I hated the first Ghost Rider film. I thought it was just wasted potential and a dumb piece of crap all-around. So with me hating the first film and me liking its standalone reboot/sequel Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, you people would call me batshit insane. What did Spirit of Vengeance get right that Ghost Rider didn't? #1: SoV is a solid action film. #2: SoV is a fun Nic Cage film. #3: SoV is an actual Ghost Rider film, and a very entertaining one at that.\n\nGhost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance involves former daredevil stuntman Johnny Blaze, played by Nicolas Cage, who is in self-imposed exile from the world. Blaze has become a tormented soul, convinced that his powers are a curse. Blaze is then approached by Moreau, a member of the monastic order of Michael, the warrior angel. Moreau seeks a protector for Nadya, played by the gorgeous Violante Placido, and her son Danny Ketch, played by Fergus Riordan, who are being pursued by a figure named Roarke, the biblical Devil himself with a detailed knowledge of the Ghost Rider and his different identities over the centuries.\n\nDirectors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor and writers Scott Gimple, Seth Hoffman, and David S. Goyer have certainly cleaned up Mark Steven Johnson's mess. I have no fucking idea why this got worse reviews than the original. For those who haven't seen this and have only seen the first, this film has absolutely nothing to do with the original...and that's probably the best thing about this sequel. Johnny Blaze and the origin of the Ghost Rider are vastly different this time around and in here, it works.\n\nNicolas Cage is a hell of a lot better here than he is in the first film. The demon Zarathos being in the Ghost Rider's body fighting within him for control of the Ghost Rider powers occasionally has Nic Cage go absolutely nuts in a few scenes (mainly because Zarathos is driving Johnny to absolute madness), and hell, I love it. You see, in this film, Nic Cage has an actual excuse as to why he's acting like a mentally insane asylum patient on screen.\n\nIn this film, Ghost Rider has a black Harley, a dirty-looking skull, a black leather jacket, and black leather pants covered in soot. Not to mention, Johnny is guzzling alcohol in this film, this trait of which he had in the comics. Good to see David S. Goyer and Neveldine & Taylor actually did their research on the source material like Goyer did with the first two Blade films, Man of Steel (sue me), and the Dark Knight trilogy.\n\nThe main villain this time is Ray Carrigan a.k.a. Blackout, played by Johnny Whitworth, who you may remember as Bradley Cooper's former brother-in-law from Limitless. Carrigan was a former mercenary who's given powers by the Devil after a series of unfortunate events in order to retrieve Danny, who turns out to be the Devil's son. Blackout can make the world around him turn pitch black and he can decay anything he touches. Whitworth does a great job playing the character, who looks exactly like he does in the comics.\n\nA supposed plot hole in this film is that if Blackout can decay everything he touches, how would he be able to retrieve Danny and give him to Roarke without killing Danny? Well, let's look at this logically. If the Devil gave Blackout the powers to combat the Ghost Rider in order to retrieve his son, I'm pretty sure the Devil would make it where Blackout couldn't kill Danny. I'd like to think that the Devil isn't that fucking stupid.\n\nIdris Elba was pretty damn good as Moreau, Violante Placido and Fergus Riordan did solid jobs as Nadya and Danny, and Ciaran Hinds was great as Roarke, but then again, Ciaran Hinds, like Morgan Freeman, is good in anything. Now, I do have some complaints about the film. The ending didn't really feel like an ending. To me, the film just stopped, kinda like Transformers 3, but it wasn't bad.\n\nChristopher Lambert was shamefully given a limited amount of screentime. In fact, he had a swordfight with Idris Elba that was cut out of the film. To Sony: you dare cut a fight between Stacker Pentecost and Connor MacLeod out of a film. Also, as much as I really liked Ciaran Hinds as the Devil, he should be playing Mephisto. In the comics, Johnny wasn't cursed by the Devil. He was cursed by a normal demon named Mephisto. Mephisto isn't Satan. However, in the context of this film, I guess the biblical Devil does have it make more sense.\n\nNow back to the good shit. Danny Ketch made for an interesting character, and from what I've heard, in the comics, Danny was originally Johnny Blaze's brother. However, seeing the present Ghost Rider (Blaze) and the future Ghost Rider (Ketch) was a satisfying treat. Their relationship was well-handled and it actually kinda reminded me of the relationship between John Connor and the T-850 in Terminator 2: Judgment Day.\n\nThe special effects and action sequences were fantastic. These action sequences destroy, piss on, and burn everything the other Ghost Rider attempted to give us. You can tell in the final action scene, a road chase scene by the way, that there was a real love for Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, with Ghost Rider and Blackout hopping on multiple cars and motorcycles fighting each other. It's awesome. I loved every minute of it.\n\nThe Ghost Rider effects are considerably better this time around. In this film, he actually looks frightening and menacing. He looks like I should be intimidated, whereas in the first film, he looks like a fucking cartoon. Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor have a directing style that is unique and entertaining. I love both Crank films and I had some fun with Gamer and Pathology, granted, I thought Jonah Hex was a load of ass. The film's dark sense of humor really works, especially with Nicolas Cage.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 7.5/10\n\nOverall, there's not much more I can say about this film that I haven't already. Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is a vast improvement upon its lousy predecessor. The film is well-paced and directed very uniquely with highly entertaining action sequences, top-notch special effects, and a great sense of fun. This is a version of Ghost Rider that is actually worth seeing. If you like Crank or Drive Angry, you'll really enjoy this movie.",

            "content": "Comic book movies are a dime a dozen these days.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, as the genre has produced some wonderful gems (Christopher Nolan's \"Dark Knight\" trilogy and the Marvel ensemble \"The Avengers\" are two recent examples of this).  However, there have also been some rather forgettable entries, and 2007's \"Ghost Rider\" falls squarely into this category.  It had some big names (Peter Fonda, Eva Mendes, Sam Elliott, and Nicolas Cage in the title role) and decent special effects, but it was ultimately done in by a weak plot and some terrible villains.  Evidently Hollywood didn't feel the same way, as here we are five years later with \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance.\"  And, perhaps not surprisingly, it's even lamer than the original.\n\nI've often defended Nic Cage as an actor, but I'm hard-pressed to defend the movies he's been acting in lately.  I know that he's in some dire financial straits, but even considering that, he's on quite the losing streak.  A good film crops up every now and again--Werner Herzog's \"Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans\" comes to mind--but that seems to be the exception rather than the rule.  Even in the turkeys, Cage is usually interesting to watch, but most of the time that's just not enough.\n\nExample: in \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,\" there's a scene in which Cage's character, former motorcycle stunt rider Johnny Blaze, is desperately trying to keep his alter ego, the fearsome Ghost Rider, in check.  You see, like the Incredible Hulk, the Ghost Rider is buried deep within the protagonist's psyche, and once unleashed, our hero has very little control over his other persona.  The Ghost Rider is a sort of bounty hunter for the damned; he feeds on evil people's souls, so when Johnny is in the presence of evil, he has to constantly fight the urge to transform into the Rider.  Why does he fight it?  Because the Rider doesn't really see things in shades of gray; whether you're a truly evil person or just a casual everyday sinner, chances are pretty good the Rider is going to come for you.  No soul is safe, as it were.\n\nCage has always excelled at portraying inner turmoil.  He's a sweaty, twitching mess in this scene, like a drug addict severely jonesing for a fix, and he uses this to scare an informant into giving up crucial information.  As I stated above, it's a fun scene to watch, but it doesn't add up to anything.  In a good film, like the aforementioned \"Bad Lieutenant,\" Cage's madness serves as a supplement to the story; it's in the service of something bigger, just another cog in the machine.  In lesser films though, it comes off more as a distraction, as if the filmmakers are hoping that Cage's antics will draw attention away from the movie's shortcomings.\n\nOn to the plot.  Since the events of the first movie, Johnny Blaze has gone into hiding in Eastern Europe.  One day he's visited by a French priest named Moreau (Idris Elba), who has a proposition for him: assist him in finding and protecting a special young boy, and Moreau's fellow clergymen will lift the Ghost Rider curse from Johnny's life forever.  I'm not exactly sure how Moreau knew where to find Johnny, but whatever.  The boy, named Danny, is being sought by the Devil (Ciaran Hinds, replacing Peter Fonda from the earlier film) for nefarious purposes, so it's a race against time to see who gets to him first.  Mayhem ensues.\n\nI could say the story is cheesy and derivative, but for a movie entitled \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,\" that kind of goes with the territory.  The bigger offense is that the movie is really rather tedious and dull.  The Ghost Rider is basically impervious to harm, so there's never any sense that he's in danger, not even when the villain opposing him is the friggin' Devil himself.  We've got machine guns, grenade launchers, car chases, and even flaming construction equipment, yet somehow it all just seems so lame and uninteresting.  Despite Cage's best efforts, I just couldn't get involved in Johnny's plight.  I couldn't in the first film, and I couldn't here either.\n\nIt doesn't help that the movie also seems determined to interject moments of humor to the proceedings...or to be more accurate, I should say \"attempts at humor.\"  You may recall that I previously praised \"The Avengers\" for not taking itself too seriously; in that far superior film, the humorous moments worked.  They felt natural.  Here, though, they seem to come out of nowhere, and again, it feels like the filmmakers are trying to distract us.  The main problem is that these moments are really not funny; they're just weird.  Weird and out-of-place.\n\nOh, and another thing... the CGI this time around is pretty bad.\n\nOverall, \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" is a very weak entry to the comic book genre.  Apart from Cage and Idris Elba--who also gives the movie far more effort than it deserves--there really isn't anything worth seeing here.  There was absolutely no need for a \"Ghost Rider\" sequel, and hopefully Hollywood has realized that now and is not making any plans to produce a third movie...though I wouldn't hold my breath on that one.",

It's not an altogether terrible film. It has a serviceable plot, but of course it stars Nicolas Cage, who's a pretty terrible actor. There isn't much in the way of coolness overall, but there is some unintentionally funny moments sprinkled in there to warrant a watch or two.

Ghost Rider hijacking the giant digger machine was freakin' awesome. There really are some creative things done visually. On the other hand, the camera movement is ugly, obnoxious, and constant, making it hard to tell what's going on during the action. His new bike sucks (what happened to the old one?). Some of the effects aren't great either. As for the rest of the film...the characters have absolutely no personality or development, the plot is thinner than paper, the acting is hokey, and there are WAY too many continuity errors with the first film. (What happend to Roxanne? Why did they change the devil's name for no reason? Why make a plot point out of Johnny scarring himself on glass signing the devil's contract when that clearly didn't happen in the first film? Why is the Ghost Rider now a spirit that possesses Johnny instead of a transformation? What happened to his stunt career?) It sort of entertained me in parts, but I was disappointed overall.",

            "content": "(1/10)\r\n\r\nHoly Shit, where do I even begin with this film? I'll get this out of the way first: This films is a total mess from beginning to end and nothing in it makes any sense. What I mean by this, is that the film is so scattershot, lazy and chaotic that it's mainly just a series of scenes held together with no cohesion. It has some of the worst editing I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe plot is that Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider doesn't want to be Ghost Rider anymore. He wants to get rid of his \"curse\" for reasons that aren't fully explained. He basically goes on this quest to find a random child so he can be a human again. Once again, this is pointless because it's never explained why he needs to take this child to a random monk temple to do this. Couldn't he have just went there anyway? I don't know and the filmmakers don't know either. It turns out that the Devil also wants this child and it's up to Nicolas Cage to stop him from getting the child. The thing is, to do that, he needs to regain his powers again. This raises the question: WHY THE FUCK DID HE GET RID OF THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE???\r\n\r\nAnyway, now to rip this movie to pieces. The main villain besides the Devil is some generic dude who the Devil granted powers to. He is the blandest villain you could possibly imagine with the blandest powers you could possibly imagine. I guess his power is to make things slowly decay? HOW EXCITING. His main job is to track down this child and bring him to the Devil because the Devil needs him for some stupid reason. THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY FUCKING SENSE. HE'S THE MOTHERFUCKING DEVIL!! Couldn't he have just went and got the child himself instead of relying on compost man?\r\n\r\nThis movie was written and directed by 6 year olds with the attention span of a squirrel on bath salts. There's a chaotic action scene that happens for no reason at a construction site and it's so over the top that it's downright embarrassing. There's a part in the movie, I shit you not, where a character asks Ghost Rider how he goes to the bathroom, and then it cuts to a black screen with Ghost Rider just pissing fire everywhere, then cuts back to the movie. This is not funny or clever, it's just downright stupid. With all the random shit that happens in the film, almost none of it is fun, just confusing and boring.\r\n\r\nHow can we talk about a Nicolas Cage movie without talking about Nicolas Cage? We can't, that's how. The thing is, he's mostly just over-the-top when he's Ghost Rider and not Johnny Blaze, so it's not even fun watching Nicolas Cage going batshit crazy in this role because a flaming CGI skeleton is doing it for him. There is one moment though where he channels his inner Cage and flips out. It is glorious.\r\n\r\nThere is only one positive to this movie (hence the 1/10), and that is Idris Elba. Why this great actor is in this piece of shit I will never know, but he is always awesome on-screen. It's too bad he's only in a few scenes.\r\nI would only watch Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance if you're going to tear it apart MST3K style with a group of friends. This is one of the most dumb, poorly scripted, poorly directed and messy films I have ever seen.",

Think of it this way, how many people riding a European touring dirt bike are going to relate to the flames, skulls, and chains?

Why even bother rebooting the series only to bring back the single worst element from the original film? SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE takes a darker approach to the material that falls more closely in line with the comics, sacrificing the kid-friendly attitude from before in lieu of the increased action and horror. Ghost Rider has received a major overhaul as well, his charred skull and blistering costume being the only welcomed changes to the character. When standing before his enemies or blazing down the highway on his hellish motorcycle, he is an awesome sight to see.

            "content": "Man, Neveldine/Taylor are so bent on cooling up this franchise that they were so far as to make Ghost Rider's skull black, so you know this is gonna get hardcore, or at least until you actually see the film and end up finding that the black-skulled man just can't catch a break. Shoot, if anyone can't catch a break, then it's, well, Nicolas Cage (Come on, Nick), as well as Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor when it comes to superhero films about vengeance seekers with burnt faces and godless powers. Granted, I liked \"Jonah Hex\" just fine, but this film is making me think back to when I said that Neveldine/Taylor should probably stick to directing, and conclude that they should, in fact, just do their own writing and directing, because they don't appear to be entirely certain of what to do when working with someone else's \"script\", or whatever document it is that they usually use to simulate something of a plot structure. Now that I think about it, if this film reminded me of nothing else, then it was of the slow spells in \"Gamer\", as this film, surprisingly, isn't too much livlier than Neveldine/Taylor's last film. You would think that a film that features Nicolas Cage as a stunt motorcyclist with powers bestowed upon him by Satan, and is directed by borderline masters of neo-exploitation wouldn't be slow, and yet, lo and behold, I present to you a film that is a bit lacking in the fun within campiness that save the original \"Ghost Rider\" for a plummet into contempt. No, this film isn't really that dull... on occasions, but make no mistake, when things aren't sloppy, they're way too steady for their own good. Still, while this film messily disappoints as a \"thriller\", this film goes saved from a plummet into contempt by many a chain of fizzle's going broken up by a couple of undeniable flares, particularly those of a technical nature.\r\n\r\nNearly all of the visual effects of 2007's \"Ghost Rider\" were well-concieved, but when it came down to the bringing of those conceptually promising effects to life, while there were some strong final renderings, most effects fell flat in execution, whereas the visual effects of this film deliver consistently, not just in concept, but in executions that dazzle in their lack of seams and richness in dynamic slickness, thus making this film remarkable as, if nothing else, an effects piece, or at least a technical piece, as Brian Berdan's editing also gets to be pretty upstanding, particularly when really played up as a supplement to a certain other area in which this film genuinely accels, or at least up to a point. Neveldine/Taylor's style is distinctly great and all, but has had a history of going a bit too far in just about every Neveldine/Taylor effort, with this film being anything but an exception, as there come occasions in which technical and storytelling stylistic choices go quite a ways over the top in their near-surrealistic flashiness and freneticism, to the point of sparking cheesiness. Still, on the whole, the stylistic choices all but fall over the entirety of this film, hit hard in their dynamic livliness, brought to life by Neveldine/Taylor's fabulously clever camerawork, which proves dizzingly dazzling in its immersive slickness, complimented by Brandon Trost's strikingly detailed and, at times, lovely cinematographic touches, and adds a lot of color that adds to this film's survival from contempt, especially when action hits the scene. I've praised this film's technicality quite a bit, even though said technicality is behind a mess of a final product, so I'd imagine it hardly comes as a surprise that the moments in which technical and stylistic value come together in the heat of battle are where this film truly shines, delivering upstanding action staging that, when backed up by Neveldine/Taylor's, well, brilliant taste in style and technicality, deliver thorough thrills that this film probably doesn't deserve. If nothing else, this film improves upon its predecessor's technicality considerably, though it's not like glimpses of what this film could have been rest only in particularly stylish moments, because with all of their missteps and being held back by a faulty script, directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor will find moments in which they truly deliver on what should have always been delivered in a \"Ghost Rider\" film, whether it be the effective capturing the Ghost Rider's presence as a brutal being of power and terror, or simply engaging fun. Moments such as the ones in question are rare, but they are here, and reward the patient with a taste of the visceral thrills that I expected from a Neveldine/Taylor interpretation of the actually somewhat promising \"Ghost Rider\" mythology. Still, on the whole, while this film doesn't exactly try patience, it's anything but rewarding, meeting occasions of what could have - nay - should have been with many a misguided misstep that nearly destroys this film and certainly leaves you to meditate upon how this film's story is a mess even in concept.\r\n\r\nI have actually heard this film's story described, by one of my favorite critics, as so beyond generic that it doesn't even deserve to be called generic, and really, I wouldn't consider this film's story concept so trite that it's glaringly unnerving, though make no bones about it, this David S. Goyer plot idea, however thin it may be, is consistently conventional, collapsing into trope after trope, and, along the way, establishing predictability that dilutes intrigue, not in the least bit helped by a script that truly marks this film's downfall. There are actually quite a few talented filmmakers behind this project who could have crafted a decent film, yet what you ultimately end up with is a testament to how much a promising project can be undercut by a shoddy script, as Scott Gimple, Seth Hoffman and David S. Goyer essentially ruin this film by turning in a messy screenplay that can't even get humor right, underusing comic relief to the point of creating awkwardly jarring tonal unevenness whenever humor is, in fact, incorporated, and making things all the worse by making the actual humor hardly worth the wait, delivering many a familiar, bland and altogether fall-flat joke. These fall-flat jokes are few in number, but only because the number of actual attempts at jokes are slim, meaning that every piece of humor in this film proves to be a particular height in the dialogue and set piece faultiness, which goes brought more to attention by certain performances, because even though inadequate acting is, regardless of what some say, somewhat rare in this film, with Idris Elba stealing the show with near-glowing charm as a noble yet expertly combative man of God and France (I don't know what's more far-fetched, a priest with exploitation-level firearm combat competence [It must be Neveldine/Taylor's tribute to their buddy from \"Gamer\", Gerard Butler, the other machine-gun preacher], or a black Frenchman; it took me long enough to get used to black Englishmen), when performances fault, they're missteps are glaring, particularly those of a person who I, at least, would expect better from. People poke their share of fun at Nicolas Cage for his recent tastes in roles and often playing the same kind of smooth, when not over-the-top dude, but really, there's no denying that Cage has, at least in the past, proven himself to be a strong actor time and again, and is even now continuing to charm in quite a few films, including this film's predecessor, which he helps greatly in saving with his charisma, but with this film, while he gets a reasonable grip on things at quite a few times, Cage really messes up, turning in moments of embarassing overacting and moments of all-out woodenness as particularly extremes in line deliveries that are all too often awkwardly distant, thus making for a weak lead performance and Nicolas Cage performance whose being a slip-up ever so unfortunately cannot be ignored. Cage has his moments, and in those moments, at least I was reminded of what made Johnny Blaze a saving grace in Mark Seven Johnson's original \"Ghost Rider\", Cage makes Blaze a fall-flat lead, or at least doesn't help in making Blaze a fall-flat lead, as Blaze, like most everyone else in this film, suffers from a lack of flesh-out, an offshoot from this film's script's definitive flaw: uneven story structuring that drive inconsistency into plotting's flow, when not at least keeping consistent with heavy-handedness that spawns anything from a lame cop-out of an a non-ending, to distance from this slam-banged story. This film's script is a total mess that plays the ultimate key part in this film's fall from decency, but really, this screenplay isn't so faulty that it can't be compensated for by a lively directorial performance, or rather, dual directorial performance, something that, in this film, sparks glimpses at what could have been at times, though ultimately doesn't help, as directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, whether it be because they find their hands tied by pressuring fellow filmmakers or because they're not without their own mistakes, fail to keep this film pumping as a whole, and make things all the worse with uneven storytelling pacing that doesn't get to be as consistently slow as I jokingly said in this review's opener, but all too often slips into dullness to break up freneticism that adds to the final product's being either exhausting or considerably bland. This film isn't entirely bad, having its share of undeniable strengths, or at least so much blandness that I found it difficult to actually find all-out disdain, yet the final product is as much a let-down as it is a misfire, backed by a misguided script, worsened by underwhelming performances, onscreen and off, that make this film nothing short of a mediocre mishandling of a promising project.\r\n\r\nOverall, visual effects and certain other technical aspects are exceptional, as is this film's dazzling style, which goes complimented by Brandon Trost's fine cinematography and helps greatly in crafting thrilling action sequences that, like occasions in which directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor deliver on certain effective storytelling moments, provide glimpses of what this film could have been, but isn't, thanks to a generic story that goes executed by a script so riddled with cheesiness - made worse by certain fall-flat performances, including that of leading man Nicolas Cage - and structural messiness - not helped by uneven areas in Neveldine/Taylor's pacing - that is spawns the consistent distance that makes \"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\" a mediocre misfire that isn't exactly disastrous, full falls flat as a mishap-heavy disappointment.\r\n\r\n2/5 - Mediocre",

But there's a catch -- Satan (Ciar\u00e1n Hinds) is looking for the boy too, and has a personal stake in the matter. But if Johnny can find Danny first and save the boy's soul, there's a chance Johnny can save his own soul as well."
