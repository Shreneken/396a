            "content": "Movies about demonic possession have been around for a very long time, some are terrifying, some are horrible. I saw the trailer for The Devil Inside when I went to see Paranormal Activity 3 and the whole audience was screaming, I have to admit that it gave me the chills too. Even though it looked a little silly, there were some genuinely creepy moments. So I saw this yesterday and despite all the bad reviews I was really curious to see what this movie was about and to give it a fair chance and may I say that the bad reviews are very justified. Not to say that this is the worst film I have ever seen, but I am getting sick of the \"lost footage\" genre, we know it's all fake so why bother trying to make us believe that it's real? Though the one thing I really give the film credit for is that it tried something different by making it into a documentary type of movie, which was really cool and I loved that it looked at both the scientific and religious side of demonic possession, giving the viewer a reason to question what was real and what was possibly a mental illness. However the slow pace of the creeps and the scares leads into one of the worst endings in movie history.Maria Rossi committed a triple murder during an exorcism performed on her. The Catholic Church became involved, and she has since been in a Catholic psychiatric hospital in Rome. Her daughter, Isabella, learned of the murders from her father, who died three days after telling her. Twenty years later, Isabella is in the process of filming a documentary about exorcisms, and to find out more about her mother, she visits a school in Rome that deals with exorcisms and enters a classroom where students, priests and scientists are having a discussion about whether or not a subject is possessed by a demon or just has a mental condition. She has dinner with a few students and ends up getting a little closer with two priests, Ben and David. They talk more about the differences between being possessed and mental illnesses, and inform Isabella that they can't explain the differences, it's something you \"just know\". On that note, Ben and David are operating outside of the Church and performing exorcisms to help patients. Isabllea then decides they are the perfect duo to help her mom, but they may have bitten more than they can chew when they accept.If you make a film about demonic possession, offer something new that we haven't seen before. I'm not talking about just the contorted bodies and talking in tongues, but they offer something great with a demon that could jump from body to body just terrorizing every human\u0085but then after this great idea and making you want even more, they pull the rug out from under you. Also, when did the demons get such a potty mouth? Taking a page from The Exorcist? The film does copy off of previous possession films which makes it not as original. The characters are unbelievable and not sympathetic so you don't care about what happens to them. Why would a family put their possessed daughter in the creepy basement locked up? Why after a priest tries to drown a baby during a baptism he's able to just walk out of the church? And why in these lost footage films do people during critical times always grab a camera? There are some good little scares with the mother who the film is somewhat centered around with her possession, what a chilling performance. However with a horrible ending, the movie is just ruined. The audience comes wanting to be entertained, not feel like they just got slapped in the face as the director is counting their money laughing to the bank.2/10",

            "content": "On 30 October 1989, in South Hartford, Maria Rossi (Suzan Crowley) brutally murders two priests and a nun during an exorcism and calls the police. Two years later, she is arrested and sentenced to the South Hartford State Asylum. However, a couple of months later, she is transferred to the Centrino Mental Hospital in Italy. Twenty years later, her twenty-five years old daughter Isabella Rossi (Fernanda Andrade) accepts to make a documentary about her mother and she travels to the Vatican School of Exorcism in Rome. Isabella befriends the priests Father Ben Rawlings (Simon Quarterman) and Father David Keane (Evan Helmuth) in the school. Then she visits her mother with the director Michael Schaefer (Ionut Grama) that is shooting the documentary. The two priests invite Isabella and Michael to witness the exorcism of a young woman. Then they go to the hospital where Maria Rossi is interned to exorcise her. Father David shows the evidences to the Church and Maria's doctor but they are not accepted. Sooner Father David is possessed by a demon and commits suicide. Isabella has a seizure and Ben and Michael take her to the hospital. Sooner they learn that Isabelle is possessed by a demon and they need to take her to Father Gallo to help Ben in an exorcism. \"The Devil Inside\" is a noisy and disappointing home video of bad quality with another story of exorcism. The acting is not bad, with the Brazilian Fernanda Andrade in the lead role; but after the original \"The Blair Witch Project\", the documentary \"style\" using a Handycam has become the favorite of people that wants to make a cheap film. The conclusion is absolutely disappointing. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): \"A Filha do Mal\" (\"The Daughter of the Evil\")",

            "content": "If star ratings were awarded for trying, The Devil Inside would definitely get 5/5 stars. It truly wants to be something. Ever since the Blair Witch Project redefined horror with its 'first person perspective' there have been many imitators.Some have worked, others haven't. Sadly, The Devil Inside is the latter.Every post-Blair Witch first person film will be judged against Blair Witch and, although The Devil Inside tries to break away, it doesn't really succeed. It's about a girl who goes to the Vatican to track down her long lost mother, who was sanctioned by the Catholic Church. Was she simply mad, or possessed? The Devil Inside lurches from one carbon copy of another similar film to another. I saw shades of Paranormal Activity mixed in there with The Last Exorcism (both superior films in my opinion). The actors did as best they could with what they were given. As with these kinds of films, they did well to capture the 'naturalistic' elements of their dialogue.It's just not that scary. If you've seen one exorcism movie, then you've basically seen this one (even if this one does do it from a first-person perspective - which The Last Exorcism has already done anyway).It's not bad, it's just not original. And (SEMI SPOILER ALERT) the ending will leave viewers thoroughly divided. You only have to look at some message boards to see that some people loved it - most despised it and felt ripped off.It's your call. If you really need one more exorcism movie, then give it a go. But you've probably seen everything The Devil Inside has to offer before... and better.",

            "review_title": "A shocker and not in a good way",
            "content": "Despite not being a fan at all overall of the found footage/mockumentary style, there are some good exceptions out there. While not an avid horror fan, though a long way from a detractor, there are some great examples and some great films based on the subject of exorcism (the king of them all still being 'The Exorcist').'The Devil Inside' however really fails to deliver. Did form my own opinion, though with a little knowledge of only a few reviews before watching, and watched with an open mind, actually wanting it to be good and be better than the slightly drab premise suggested. 'The Devil Inside' was just a shocker in almost every sense of the word, we are not talking about the type of film it is but the actual quality of the film.It's not entirely without redeeming merits, though the cons are far more numerous and significantly larger. The best performance comes from Suzan Crowley, who gives a heck of a chilling performance. Surprisingly also the contortionist effects were pretty unsettling.However, that is it for 'The Devil Inside's' good points. 'The Devil Inside' has such a drab look and further cheapened by the excessive and badly abused (even for this particular style of filming) shaky cam, which will make people nauseous and should come with a health warning for epileptics (speaking as one myself).Can't remember anything about the music, while the directing is lifelessly amateurish and the script is a shambles with far too much talk and too much emphasis on the science-versus-religion and faith-versus-scepticism, which really bogs down the atmosphere.No better news about the story or atmosphere either. The story is sluggish, increasingly derivative and predictable, with some unintentionally silly parts too, while the atmosphere in general is just too histrionic and there is next to nothing scary in a film already rather under-populated in the scare factor. Only Crowley and the contortionist effects offer any kind of that.Much has been said about that abruptly lazy cheat/cop-out of an ending and for very good reason. Crowley aside, the acting is very poor, with a lead performance from Fernanda Andrade that is both histrionic and somnambulist.All in all, a shocker in almost every way. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

The ending was I call a \"ran out of money\" ending. Definitely worth waiting for the DVD release. I didn't mind the whole Blair witch/paranormal activity/cloverfield camera action they used. It was just the fact you knew what was coming 1 step ahead. Not to leave out the very dull ending but I guess it would have cost too much $ to actually leave us paying folk to know what happened to the people we spent the last 87 minutes caring about. Overall had a few creepy parts. Dog barking made my body ache. Just don't waste your time and money running to the theater to see this one.",

            "review_title": "Good story. Would love to see a sequel.",
            "content": "The movie is only about an hour and 15 minutes. Nothing after the credits and the credits are the slowest scrolling credits I've ever seen in my life. My assumption is that it scrolled so slowly because there weren't a lot of people who worked on the film (since the cast was small and budget was low) and they didn't want the run time to be so short as to devalue the movie and discourage people from paying to see it; thinking they wouldn't get much bang for the buck. I guess they had to do something to extend it and this is what they chose.It's filmed in a found footage/documentary style that works for the movie. It doesn't use too many cheap or jump scares. The only bad acting belonged to the chick who played Isabella Rossi. The most important character in the entire movie is actually the person filming everything named Michael and he gets the least amount of face time and dialogue. None of the footage would even exist if he wasn't filming. Therefore, without him, no movie. He does express that during an MTV's Real World type confessional. There actually is a story here. It's not just a bunch of things happening on screen with no rhyme or reason. The story itself is very good. I like it. It's not necessarily original but the way the movie ends, if there is a sequel, it would have to be filmed in a more traditional movie-making style. That means no found footage. I just gave something away if you're paying attention.There are intentional holes left in the movie that can only be answered with a sequel. Like Maria Rossi's possession. Why was she chosen to be possessed, why did the demon who possessed her make her do what she did, and which demon possessed her? I think exorcism as a whole could be explored more since part of the theme of this movie is the law surrounding the act of exorcism and how it needs to change. Another theme is distinguishing between mental illness and possession; a separation of science and religion. I liked what they were doing here by exploring other aspects of an overused genre but all the questions weren't answered. That's not a bad thing. A different twist is similar to what was done in the movie Fallen and that concept was explained during the movie.If you're gonna see this, and I'd give this a thumbs up to see it, then go when there's gonna be less people in the auditorium or see it at a reputable theater and that's what I recommend for every movie anyway. This movie ain't worth full price. Catch a matin\u00e9e or half price or something. Dollar movie works too. It's worth seeing in theaters.This movie didn't back down on violence. Just when I thought they weren't gonna show certain things, they showed it and I appreciated that. No watering down here although I believe some brief nudity in one scene would have added to the realism. This also reminds me of REC but this isn't anywhere near as good as that. REC, when watched under the right conditions, will stay with you for a while. It burns an image into your head that doesn't go away and that's what a good horror movie is supposed to do: make you look over your shoulder and around corners and through shower curtains and keeps you awake at night. REC does just that and gives a compelling story. This also has a good story that I'd really like to see continued if it makes enough money because, similar to REC, it appears there's something bigger going on and this first installment only scratches the surface. It teases more and I believe it can deliver with a second movie.The way the movie ends, there was a collective sigh of disappointment. It leaves you wanting more and since that's what made people disappointed, I'd say it did its job. It also makes you wonder because there is something that happens in that last scene and you don't know who the survivor is. That's all I'll say about that. The last scene was unique and a bit funny given the circumstances, I'll give it that much. It was original. If that last survivor is who it should be, then we have a sequel if they ever make it and I'd love to see it at an equal or better level of quality. No complaints about the special effects which weren't that many to begin with. I give this 7 out of 10 stars. Not a bad movie. Worth seeing. Not too scary but I'm sure some people will be affected by certain scenes because it doesn't use too many tricks to get the job done. It has a very creepy scene that affects you as if you were watching the movie Session 9. It's short but effective and that describes the entire movie. Just make sure to watch this with the right people in the right environment.",

If you think shaky cameras and blurry movies suck, then we are in agreement. This movie is so awful that I could not see much of it.

So in addition to the shaky blurry scenes, we get annoying characters talking to the camera to let the audience know what they are thinking.

            "content": "First off, I'm not a 15 year old girl who just saw her first scary movie. Second, I really enjoy the intimacy and tone of found footage movies.I am shocked to see so many negative reviews about this movie. The trailer was not misleading? I'm confused about some of the negative hype. If you are saying there is no real ending to this movie, or that you don't understand, you need to see the movie again. It very clearly explains itself. I really enjoyed the ending. I really don't like hype, but I gave into it when people started posting the trailer everywhere. When it came out, and I saw all the negative reviews, I immediately lowered my standards. This movie did not disappoint.This is not a big budget thriller. If you want another cheesy movie with hot naked girls running away from serial killers, go watch Hostel. It may not be strikingly original, but I found the tone to be very scary. If you want to see the another Academy Award worthy film with amazing dialogue and special effects, go see something else. It is very rare that a movie gets my adrenaline going. You have to remember that this is supposed to be a documentary that takes place in the time span of a couple months, not a narrative about someone's life. You have to use your imagination to get into the style of film. I guess some people don't have imaginations anymore. I found the jump scenes to be quite frequent and valid to the story, although one jump scene with a dog comes at a random time in the movie, and has nothing to do with the storyline. There is more gore than I anticipated, which is a plus. I feel like they fit it into the movie very well. Senseless, randomly placed gore in a film shows me that the creators are trying too hard. The special effects were not overdone. The exorcism scenes were quite disturbing, unlike what others may be saying.The story takes a turn when after the exorcism of the lead role Isaballa's mother, the demons transfer to the priest, and eventually Isabella. I guess people are interpreting this as a hole in the story or something, but I thought it was a great turn.Summary: I'm extremely picky on horror movies, I find most to be either over done or really generic. This one got me. I am a fan of the style of film, although some people are not. This movie will receive low ratings because it's not The Sixth Sense or Insidious, but will end up with a good cult following, seeing as some people do actually care to have a good thrill. If you like Blair Witch, I'd highly recommend this movie. I was NOT disappointed.",

            "review_title": "Back-Alley Exorcisms",
            "content": "\"The Devil Inside\" is the first demonic possession film I know of to entertain the idea of back-alley exorcisms \u2013 that is, those performed by ordained exorcists outside official religious jurisdiction. They're portrayed as progressives eager to bypass the hypocritical and bureaucratic sanctioning of the church, which, according to them, has been alarmingly selective when it comes to who can and cannot receive the services of an exorcist. Officials stipulate that there's a definite difference between possession and mental illness, and not all cases fall into the former category. The priests in this film understand that there's a definite difference, although they also believe that a great many people are authentically possessed and have been overlooked by the system. And so, under constant threat of discovery and excommunication, they provide help to those who need it.On the basis of the film's pathetically low Rotten Tomatoes score, I would wager that most critics somehow missed this surprisingly clever and timely social commentary. It seems we're also in disagreement over how frightening the film is. While by no means the scariest movie ever made, it effectively builds tension, and there are moments that made me jump in my seat. Is it just that I scare too easily, or did I remember how these movies are supposed to work? Furthermore, there's something to be said about a demonic possession movie that doesn't hold back in terms of disturbing visuals; in the course of this movie, we will see people contorting into impossible shapes, splayed bodies at a crime scene, and in one instance, profuse vaginal bleeding. The only time I thought the filmmakers went too far was in a scene that, oddly enough, did not involve an exorcism. Instead, it involved a baptism.Having said all that, some of the criticisms aimed at this film are valid. From a technical standpoint, it breaks no new ground as a found-footage mockumentary, at this point a genre in and of itself. We have the usual fare: The combination of hand-held and surveillance recordings, the persistent use of the Queasy Cam, the frantic journeys through dark corridors and rooms, and the bookending claims that (1) the film is documenting a real event, and (2) the case remains unsolved to this day (we're even provided with the address of a website to visit for more \"information\"). Structurally, it gets off to an implausible yet decent start, only to become more predictable and routine as it enters the final act. Initially engaging characters become progressively less developed until they're reduced to stock horror movie caricatures. And then there's the ending, which isn't bad so much as it is abrupt. When the credits start rolling, there's the unshakable feeling that something more needs to be said.The film opens with a recording of a 911 call made on October 30, 1989, in which we hear the emotionally vacant voice of a woman slowly confessing to the murders of three people. We then see police footage of the crime scene, and yes, we get ample views of three gore-ridden bodies and the blood-stained weapons used on them. The victims, we soon learn, were trying to perform an exorcism on the murderer, a woman named Maria Rossi (Suzan Crowley). After being arrested, the Catholic Church got involved and shipped Maria off to a sanitarium in Rome. The details of the America-to-Italy transfer are a little sketchy, as is the reason for having her sent to Italy at all, but never mind. At this point, we flash forward to footage shot in 2009. It seems that Maria's daughter, Isabella (Fernanda Andrade), has hired a documentary crew to follow her to Rome and capture on film the attempts to save her mother.After attending an exorcism seminar, she's introduced to two priests, both ordained exorcists. One is Ben (Simon Quarterman), a Brit who entered the priesthood largely due to his uncle. The other is David (Evan Helmuth), an American who's also a licensed physician and has built his reputation on the fusion of science and religion. While both are men of faith, they disapprove of the church's dismissal of certain possession cases, and they take it upon themselves to perform the necessary exorcisms \u2013 a big no-no. They make it clear that, in order to really understand demonic possession, Isabella will have to witness an exorcism first hand. And so she does. She will also reunite with her mother, who becomes dangerously hostile at the sight or even the mere mention of religious paraphernalia. The only exceptions would be the inverted crosses she has cut into her forearm.That all of this is ridiculous, there can be no argument. All the same, the characters were developed in such a way that I was genuinely curious about where the story would go. Alas, the Maria Rossi subplot is eventually dropped altogether, at which point the film stops being character-driven and becomes a run-of-the-mill horror thriller. Ideas that were only alluded to, such as multiple demon possession and the transference of a demon from one body to another, are now foremost on the minds of the filmmakers. Given the deceptively satirical undertones of its opening and middle acts, this is a bit of a letdown. All the same, \"The Devil Inside\" is nowhere near as bad as most claim it is. If you can see your way past its lack of originality and authenticity \u2013 which is, when you think about it, the case with most horror movies \u2013 I think you'll be plenty satisfied by what it has to offer.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",

Were the characters any good? decent enough for me, when are characters ever really that brilliant in horrors? Again, it's not my primary concern, I go with the hope of being scared and this movie was more successful than I'm used to in that sense.I was also very impressed with how well they shattered the sense of safety in the movie. The demons were running wild, they made significant development jumping between people and they were totally unpredictable. They were always initially restrained and they were always too strong to be held back.My only real complaint: I'm tired of the documentary style horrors.

            "content": "The Devil Inside merges two sub-genres of horror that should be killed off like the teens in a remade slasher movie. The exorcism genre and the found footage genre have long overstayed their welcome in the film industry and need to be abolished. The found footage genre, I can sometimes tolerate. The exorcism genre I can barely look at. Merging them together is a colossal miscalculation.There is something in cinema nicknamed \"trailer fail.\" You may not know the term, but you've certainly experienced it. When a comedy movie experiences \"trailer fail,\" it means all the funny and entertaining scenes exist in the trailer, rendering the rest of the film as \"filler comedy.\" If an action or science fiction film is victim to it, take Richard Gere's The Double, it gives away the big plot twist in the trailer. And if in a horror film, this happens a lot in found footage films, all the jump scares and interesting scenes are in the trailer. The Devil Inside isn't a case of trailer fail, but a case of trailer disgust. Every scene in the trailer is the highest quality material you'll find in this film. If you didn't enjoy the trailer, then you didn't enjoy the best parts.Most exorcism movies pack in a redundant and asinine plot. This one is no exception. In October of '89, Maria Rossi (Crowely) committed triple murders while performing an exorcism in her ragtag house. Twenty years later, her daughter, now grown up, is Isabella and is in desperate need for answers.She and her convenient documentarian friend take a trip to Rome, Italy where her mother is being held in a mental hospital to not only seek answers from her, but to dive into the mysteries and the actions of exorcism.We get a bogus 911 call at the beginning, shaky camera footage upon arrival to the house of Maria Rossi, fake news reports, then we get about a half hour of incredibly mundane and dry dialog about religion, Christianity, the Vatican, churches, and of course, exorcisms. Tell me, Paramount. If you want this to be the next Paranormal Activity, why did you include so many tiresome scenes of dialog that will bore your audiences? That's not to say films like The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity didn't have dry spots. I was never bored by either, but can see why some were. The big difference with those films is they both had one thing to back themselves up with; an eerie, ominous atmosphere. Nothing about The Devil Inside's setting is eerie or ominous. It's as dry as the material we're presented with.I will say The Devil Inside gave me one of the best theater experiences I've had in a while. Usually, when a movie ends, at least in ones I see, everyone just gets up and walks out whispering or being utterly silent. I was in a theater of about fifteen people of all different age groups and as soon as the abashed ending rolled around and concluded the mess we all watched, everyone was yelling obscenities and mimicking the film they just saw. When I was in the restroom at the end, I engaged in multiple conversations with people who were just as angry and as cheated as I was. One man said \"I haven't seen something that horrible since Will Ferrell's Land of the Lost!\" A woman was questioning the ending from multiple aspects. I turned to her and said \"a movie of this poor nature is not worth your good questions. It can barely answer its own.\" Ever since The Exorcist in 1973, we have been paralyzed by the very thoughts of exorcism. Now, we've seen it all. Some people in my theater were laughing at the film. Because it focuses on the exaggerated hokum of the practice. Like all of the movies do. Climbing the walls, spider-walking down the stairs, screaming, using foul language, and out of place deep voices have all become standards in these kinds of films.Last year, around this same time, a movie about the dramas of the practice came out. It was Anthony Hopkins' The Rite, another film of the same nature I found long and tedious. But at least it had insight, which I believe I acknowledged. The problem was it was long and uneventful, but at least it didn't try to glorify the practice. The Devil Inside doesn't even look in the same direction as the new ground it likes to think it is breaking.I bring up The Rite because in the time frame of almost a year I've seen a long drama about the practice and a terrible found footage faux documentary on it as well. I found The Rite afloat in a sea of mediocrity, and I find The Devil Inside to be a work of trash filmmaking. My question; will there ever be a good exorcist movie ever again? We've seen two films in two separate genres fail to bring justice to the idea of the practice. My assumption from here on out is that we will never get a film like the 1973 masterpiece.It's only January, and I have the perfect candidate for the top of my worst films of the year list.Starring: Fernanda Andrade, Simon Quarterman, Evan Helmuth, and Suzan Crowley. Directed by: William Brent Bell.",

            "content": "\"The Devil Inside\" focuses on Isabella Rossi as she tries to figure out the mysterious murdering spree of her mother 20 years before. She later finds out that it was during an exorcism that her mother killed three people. After being arrested, Maria Rossi is sent to a mental hospital for the criminally insane in Rome and Isabella travels there to figure out what is wrong with her mother. The problem is more than just a mental illness, but evil itself incarnate in her. My first thought before seeing this movie was that it was going to be another one of those \"exorcism\" movies. Turning heads, spider-walking down the stairs...we have all seen them. Before this film, most exorcism flicks just focused on these traits. None of them really discussed the religious aspect in terms of the Roman Catholic Church. I commend \"The Devil Inside\" for doing this. It really revealed the true inner feelings of the Church on exorcism, especially in today's society. Some people are separated in the idea of exorcism, even the religious people and this film did a great job in conveying this confusion and conflicting views. Mental illness is the panacea diagnosis, but there may be something more. Honestly, I am not a very big fan of the hand-held camera style. But this movie, overall, did a great job with handling this style. Yes, there were spots where the camera was a little shaky, but it's a given with these kinds of movies. The camera was almost always on the action that was happening at the moment. It didn't try to trick the audience by moving the camera somewhere else while there is a m\u00eal\u00e9e happening just outside the view of the camera. The fake-documentary style is one of my favorites, mainly because of \"The Last Exorcism\".Overall, the plot was very well planned. It was quite an original plot with a unique twist on multiple-demonic possessions. I thought that the plot flowed and didn't drag in any spots. All speaking parts fit in with the action and all discussions explained important aspects necessary to understand the movie. All in all, this is one of the scariest movies I have seen. Everyone in the movie theater was on the edge of their seats. Yes, the ending was a bit disappointing, but the cliff-hanger was a great way to end this movie. This is a kind of movie that if it ended on a good note, it would have ruined the mood of the whole movie. That shroud of mystery was a perfect touch. I found the ending words that \"the case is still being investigated\" to be a little cheesy, which is why I gave it 8 stars. But other than that, I would highly recommend that you watch it. It is well worth every penny. Enjoy!",

I went in to watching this with some apprehension after reading such mediocre reviews ready to turn it off after 10 minutes, but as I watched it I was drawn in more and more. It had tension, atmosphere and some nice bloody scenes. Throw in some cringe worthy scenes and in my opinion you have a good little film here.

My friend had been talking about how she wanted to see it since the trailers first started popping up. So, we ended up going last night to see this (opening night).Let me just say that the theater was PACKED for this movie. We got to the theater 30 minutes before the start time and the line was already out the door. As for the movie itself, it started off slow in the beginning and slowly got more and more intense. The exorcism scenes were especially frightening and very well done in my opinion. The movie is a mockumentary style movie, so it does feel real as some points. The ending is very intense and I was pleased. However, most of the theater booed when the credits started rolling. Of course, 75% of the theater was teenagers.Overall, I give this film a 7 out of 10. It wasn't the best exorcism movie I've seen; but it also wasn't the worst. Worth the money.",

            "content": "*Very minor spoiler. This is my first review. Have mercy.Important note before I begin:The problem I see with people watching movies like \"The Devil Inside\" is that they go in restless expecting people to twist into knots and get ripped apart with nonstop action. This is not that movie. I walked into the theater just wanting to be entertained and simply put, I was. What I find to be necessary in slower movies like this is to let yourself become absorbed in the story rather than trying to poke holes in the story and critique it as you watch it. I let myself be absorbed by the film and that is the perspective I will review it from.Review:This faux documentary centers around a girl who all but witnessed her mother murder three people in what is later discovered to be an exorcism. Obsessed with finding out the truth of that night, she embarks on a trip to Rome with her filmmaking counterpart in order to document their adventure into the dark world of exorcisms, and what they find is disgusting, shocking and grotesque in a few instances, but you just can't look away. What the director has done here, is try to balance dialogue with action... a risky deviation from most horror films. The dialogue is a bit slow sometimes, but it is never off topic and keeps the story moving while giving a little more depth to each character after each sequence. Now don't mistake what I am saying... the screenplay is far from revolutionary, but it is a good start. The dialogue can be a bit cheesy certainly not helped by periods of lackluster acting, but as a whole, the film did not disappoint. A good exorcism movie is hard to make simply because the viewer knows the stereotype and no one has yet to deviate from it yet. This movie tried in its own way to reinvent the exorcism movie and did in some ways, but kept faithful to what we know and appreciate for the most part. \"The Devil Inside\" is not the action movie to go see with a bunch of friends. This is a movie best seen quietly. Take it in. Try not to pick apart every detail and your movie-going experience will dramatically improve for this movie. I give it a solid 7/10. I left entertained and frankly a little freaked out. Exactly what a good horror movie should leave you with.",

I like them because they seem more real, This one includes interviews, hand-camera shots etc. I'll say it right now and that is if you don't like blair witch style movies and those fake documentary style movies then this probably isn't for you.The movie itself is about a woman who discovered her mother was involved in an exorcism and was shipped out to Rome, Italy afterward and she goes to discover why and look for some answers.Things all go downhill for her from there.The movie's acting and story are great I had no issues whatsoever with it there. You could tell it seems a tad amateurish in terms of their acting at times but I still thought everyone did well in it.The story and scary scenes were all great, I've seen a number of these styles of movies, Quite a lot more then the average watcher and this one while it won't give me nightmares at night it still delivered a few very solid and tense scenes. I was a bit let down by the ending though and that was my only issue I had with the whole film. The make-up and dialogue were all very good too and at times during some of the exorcisms it almost reminded me a little bit of the original exorcism which you can tell the film makers had a lot of influence from that.My only qualms against this movie were that there could have been more scary scenes and I wished for a better ending. That said though the scary scenes that were there were very nicely done!I have a feeling this movie will get a lot of hate because of its mockumentary style of filming which is not very Hollywood like of horror movies so I feel a lot of people will dislike it for that but if you're in the mood for a horror that's got a dark realistic tone to it then by all means give it a go and you shouldn't be disappointed.",

I honestly can't believe this film got released into theatres, scene after scene was a regurgitation of scenes that we've all seen before. Not just individual scenes, but the whole tone of the film was so familiar and dull.I didn't take count, but after a noticeable amount of times of the date being shot at me with a low dong was laughable, the bloke who made it must've watched paranormal activity and thought \"ooh that was good, I'll have that... then I'll grossly over use it\" There was nothing new about any of the exorcism scenes, apart from it was with a hand held camera.. wow. just watch the exorcist and shake the TV around.I felt like i was watching an awful, pretentious student film from the outset and most of the acting had me cringing in my seat. I literally have never seen a worse all round acting display in my life... it was just totally unacceptable. They were trying so hard to make it look 'real' or 'genuine' and it just looked pathetic, so many face head scratching and little smirks to themselves.I won't go into the ending... but it summed the movie up really. unoriginal, contrived and no shock factor (which was obviously intended) you know when a film is so bad its kind of entertaining? well this is just offensive. It was shameful. I can't think of one redeeming quality.DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS FILM",

            "content": "Where do I begin? This movie is awful, in every aspect of the word.Further justifications: Every thing sucked in this film. The acting was very wooden. Fernanda Andrade is not a good lead actress, but she is hot, so I guess the film could score mild points for that...but the rest of the cast is just incredibly bad (Hmm...That's a bit of a stretch...Suzan Crowley is pretty freaky as Maria Rossi), but every other actor looks like they couldn't care less about the film. They look annoyed, even more annoyed than the audience watching it. It's as if the project was something very boring for them and they couldn't wait to get the hell off of it.I understand this is mockumentary, but whoever was handling the camera sucked. Did he just discover the zoom button? Because the fact that the camera would close up on faces and then back continuously really annoyed the $h!t out of me. Finally, I felt there was a lack of scares: I jumped once, which is the same place I jumped in the trailer (the one where Maria Rossi starts to laugh suddenly). The scriptwriters decided to get lazy as well, I suppose, because right when the movie is about to get interesting, it cuts to black and ends, telling us to check a website. What's that if it's not telling the audience to f--k off. I felt like I had been insulted.Bottom line: I knew from the start that this movie would be bad. A friend of mine convinced me to go with a few girls, who chose to see this movie. If only I had listened to my first instinct.Look, this movie made 33 times it's budget on opening weekend (33 million dollars for a 1 million dollar budget). The studios don't care about the people who watch this film anymore, and quite frankly, you shouldn't care about this movie either. It's not worth seeing in theatres - wait - It's not worth seeing at all! When is Hollywood going to realize that over doing mockumentaries just gets annoying because they don't scare us anymore.

            "content": "Found footage horror films these days are almost a dime a dozen, and to a discerning audience who will almost always head to the cinemas regardless, the challenge is to go one leg up over previous offerings, although most of the time many will fail at the final lap providing an ending that is quite disapproved of. The Last Exorcism was something that went out with a bang that was much reviled, but this one, directed by William Brent Bell, who co- wrote the story with Matthew Peterman, got critics and audiences up in arms in lambasting it as the worst film of all time. But is it really?The ingredients for a horror film that serves up its fair share of scares are all inside this effort. There's Rome, there're demonic possessions, there's creepy sound effects and shadow and light play, jump scares, quick cuts, the works, although given that it's of the found footage genre one really cannot complain about the jerky and shaky camera-work that could get a little bit nauseating. It begins with a mystery, where a woman got makes a call to the police confessing having to kill 3 persons, only for us to slowly realize through newsreels that it was three persons involved in an exorcism on the woman who had turned tables around.We then fast forward to the woman's daughter Isabella (Fernanda Andrade) who decides to go solve the mystery behind her mother's deeds, who is now locked up in the Vatican's appointed hospital for psychiatry. A documentary crew she conveniently commissions follows her to Rome, where she meets up with the priests Ben (Simon Quarterman) and David (Evan Helmuth) who soon bring her to experience one of their exorcisms performed on a woman called Rosalita (Bonnie Morgan), where the episode serves as a jump point and catalyst for everything else in the movie to follow on at breakneck speed, with the usual inputs that you'd already come to see in countless of exorcist type movies, and develops with a hint of what's being known as transference.There are a couple of open, unresolved subplots that have opened the doors for prequels and sequels to happen, although whether or not these will be done is a huge question given the very large backlash. For instance, the back-story of Ben was kept very ambiguous, as is Isabella's, both having done something that could either be revealed to be more than meets the eye, or expanded for a little bit more depth. The build up toward the final act was great, because it created such a huge expectation that the stunt it pulled off in the last scene is admittedly very ballsy, although it got a reaction opposite of what it expected to be rewarded for having the guts to be different, pulling the plug and denying everyone a climatic battle to the finish.Many will fault the film for that, and probably bear a grudge to condemn everything else that transpired in the film, which to me feels a little bit unfair. It decided to do what it set out to, and reminded everyone again of going back to basics for the sub-genre - something has to happen in some fashion like this for the found-footage itself to work. It is found after all, and inherently that calls for things to be left hanging, logically speaking. I have to credit the film too for being the only one I've seen so far in a horror film, where menstrual blood got spewed from the source and found reason to be splattered all over the camera. Talk about morbidity when you least expected it, in the most gooey fashion the filmmakers conjured.For what got invested in production, the box office returns already made this a success, thanks to horror film aficionados who contributed to its coffers early in its release, before word of mouth slowly condemned it to fall quite spectacularly at the charts. Still, those looking for some scares will find The Devil Inside serving them up, but you'll just have to hold on to your horses at its ending - if you're open minded enough it's something you won't condemn immediately, especially if you take a step back to consider its few production and narrative merits.",

My favourite character was probably Simon Quarterman. He did alright and at least had some character development. The rest was just doing what they already did, with Father Ben we really saw what happened with his uncle etc. The only thing about Isabella that actually stayed with me was that she had an abortion. The ending absolutely SUCKS, it's such a good example of 'damn uhh we're out of budget so meh I guess we'll let the audience decide the ending.' BAM credits.

            "content": "Everybody is capable of being surprised. Me, especially. \"The Devil Inside,\" a low-budget horror film directed and co-written by William Brent Hill, is precisely the sort of movie that I usually despise. It's a film with low production values that stand out clearly, it stops instead of concluding, it's not truly scary for a second, and it's a 'found footage' movie. One of those pictures in the vein of \"Paranormal Activity,\" \"Cloverfield,\" and \"The Blair Witch Project.\" Actually, \"The Devil Inside\" is more akin to a recent movie called \"The Last Exorcism.\" Except whereas that movie left me utterly uninvolved and unmoved, this one captivated me in a small way.I suppose many would consider it a failed exercise in terror. I can stretch my review enough to consent to that; I was not scared. No, this is no more scary than \"The Last Exorcism\" or most 'found footage' movies. At the same time, however, director Hill and his co-screenwriter, Mathew Peterman, decided to save the mock-horror effects for the absolute minimal amount of time needed. In most pictures of this caliber, the first half is exposition and the second sequence-after-sequence of deranged faces lunging at the camera. There are probably just a handful of minutes of scenes meant to be scary and much longer moments following the characters around.There lies the difference between \"The Devil Inside\" and \"The Last Exorcism.\" The latter tried so insistently hard to frighten me out of my wits and ultimately failed. The former chooses to play around with the exposition. As a result, it's not depressing nor very boring. It also benefits from some surprisingly good performances, even though the characters are horror-movie stereotypes. In particular, I liked the lead performance by Fernanda Andadre, playing a young woman wanting to learn the truth about the night her mother murdered three people. Simon Quarterman and Evan Helmuth are also in good form as two Vatican priests who use their on-the-side exorcism practices in an attempt to help her. There is, of course, the typical documentary maker/skeptic, and Ionut Grama plays him without much style. Then again, the role gives him almost no range whatsoever.Pleased as I was with \"The Devil Inside,\" I do wish the filmmakers had chosen to do things the old-fashioned way. Drop the hand-held 'found footage' cheap effect, and stick with the way movies have been made for more than a hundred years. With the camera being an invisible eye following our characters. And, pleased as I am, I must join the crowd in lambasting the ending. Many contemporary shockers prefer to stop their stories instead of appropriately wrapping them up; what we get here is perhaps the most inexcusable example of this moronic motif yet. Instead of leaving me with my jaw hung and my mind racing about, the 'ending' made me feel cheated and a bit frustrated.I am one of maybe five or six people on the face of the planet who found any enjoyment in \"The Devil Inside.\" Admittedly, it is not for most horror fans. It's not scary, but most of the time, it is not trying to be. Ten years from now, it won't be a film that jumps into my mind when discussing the films of 2012.

            "content": "* out of (****)Exorcism films are one of the hardest films to make for two reasons. (1) Critics and audiences alike dethrone nearly any film that doesn't measure up to the impeccable heights of that of Friedkin's 1973 cinematic icon \"The Exorcist\". And (2) Because they offer next to nothing to the table, making it 80+ minutes of virtually watching the same film- over and over again. (Sometimes even less than 80- Thank the Lord). So typically, I tend to try to be as lenient as possible when critiquing a film of such content because I know it is a tough accomplishment to actually make a serviceable horror flick. Bell's sophomore effort \"The Devil Inside\" revolves around Isabella Rossi (Fernanda Andrade) who traveled to Italy to attend exorcism school and to pay a visit to her ill mother Maria Rossi, played by Suzan Crowley. From there, a few questions are at stake. What's wrong with Maria Rossi? Could Maria's demon be transferred to her daughter? Could Isabella turn out like her mother?Just by hearing the synopsis, I'm pretty sure you don't need to spare 87 minutes to conjure up some logical answers based on the aforementioned questions. But let's talk about the performances first. The acting is surprisingly decent. Everyone here does there job... but that's pretty much it. You can certainly throw character development out the window as every actor is dull and about as lifeless as a cardboard cut-out. It's hard to sympathize with our main protagonists when they aren't even established as characters. Strike one. Strike two, the film takes an excruciatingly long time to get the ball rolling. For the first hour or so, you have to hear some tedious blabber about religion, which doesn't serve as controversial, but just insipid and soporific. I don't mind drawn-out sequences of dialogue, if it has something to say about our characters or the plot, but it's used to consume most of the already short running time. Here's my philosophy: If you don't have enough footage to tell your story and still keep your audience's interest, don't stretch out what originally could've been a solid 15 minute story into 70 more minutes. Now onto the question everyone wants to know: Is it scary? Absolutely not. \"Devil\" resorts to generic jump scares, heavy cut-aways, and the shaking of the camera. If you weren't scared by the trailer, you must certainly won't be by the film. Which reminds me, if you're going to shoot a film in mockumentary style, at least make it believable. Just because you shoot in found-footage doesn't mean you can side-skirt believability. I'm one who is prone to stretch my imagination, but not as far as Bell wants me to. What am I, an imbecile?And lastly, this film is just so predictable. If you're film isn't frightening, and certainly isn't interesting, try to spice it up a bit. If you've watched any film about an exorcism, you've seen this one already. I completely guessed the \"twist\" (if you can even call it one) even before I got to the theater. And that ending? One of the most retarded endings I've seen in a long time. How they got away with such a haphazard ending is just... MIND BOGGLING.For the first thirty minutes or so, \"The Devil Inside\" isn't such a bad outing. It raises a few interesting plot points, the direction is pretty good for the most part, and actually got me invested in what Bell was trying to sell the viewer here. After that, it's pretty much downhill and when you think things couldn't get any worse, the last five minutes prove that. Just when you think the film was going somewhere, it just cuts you off and is of the equivalence of shoving the middle finger down our throats, saying \"Ha Ha. I took your money. See us next year for the sequel.\" All I wanted to see was a decent exorcism movie. I didn't care how predicable or clich\u00e9d it was. I didn't care if I was the biggest fan of the actors or not. All I asked for was a decent way to spend 87 minutes, and I couldn't even get that. If you seriously want a good exorcism movie, rent \"The Exorcist\" or if you want something more modern, see \"The Last Exorcism\". But for the love of God (no pun intended), do not see \"The REPUGNANCE Inside\" or \"The Rite\". Oh and the film apparently wants you to see their \"website\"? F. THAT.",

Even though this was supposed to have been filmed in 2009 there are cheap \"aging\" effects applied to the film which makes no sense at all. It's not scary or even interesting.

But if you watched it anyway, don't write bad reviews and make true fans of this genre skip the movie for the wrong reasons.The Devil Inside will shock, scare and disturb you. This movie is about a good-looking girl (Fernanda Andrade) trying to figure out what happened to her crazy mom who is now in an asylum. To fully understand what happened to her mom, she starts making a documentary about exorcism with the help of two maverick priests and a camera guy. The premise is not original, but seems realistic. The plot is predictable, but the exorcism scenes have the chills and thrills that fans of demonic possession seek! The elements that make it different is that it does not rely on cheap sound effects and graphics, the old lets-run-around-with-a-night-vision-camera thing and pointless off-screen noises and sounds.I have seen a lot of crappy horror movies (unfortunately) that abuse the whole found-footage/shaky cam genre, but this movie uses it well. If you liked 'The Last Exorcism', chances are you may like this movie for the exorcism scenes. However, The Last Exorcism has a great plot and a better ending. My guess is that the writers of this movie wanted to keep it closer to reality and therefore did not put much effort into the plot. Bad decision, never underestimate a good plot.The big downside however is not the weak plot, but just when the movie gets really interesting, it ends. My advice to the ones who are disappointed by the low ratings and bad reviews but are curious to check it out nonetheless is this - lower your expectations, turn off the lights and give it a go.

Although I think Blair Witch and PA did a much better job of making the \"found footage\" gimmick believable. Anyway The Devil Inside tells the story of a young girl, Isabelle who travels to Italy to learn more of the so-called demonic possession of her institutionalized mother.The film opens with a 911 call made from the girl's mother in which she confesses to murdering three people who were trying to perform an exorcism. I guess it's safe to say it didn't work because when we next see the mother, she's holed up in Italian hospital for the criminally insane, mumbling to herself and looking generally frightening. Isabelle is looking to investigate the circumstances behind her mother's crimes and hopefully get her returned to the United States. And so the footage goes, mostly capturing her quest to learn more about exorcism, along with some help from two men she meets at a Roman Catholic university.It could have been a very effective film if it wasn't for the glaringly flawed ending. Up to that point there was nice buildup and a few rather shocking moments. Then abruptly, it just ended. Poof! Like that. Shows over, go home. Myself along with the entire audience sat there for several moments after the ending scene, waiting....for something. I guess it took a few minutes to realize there would be nothing else. The ending came out of nowhere. None of the questions raised by the film were ever answered. The last 10 minutes embarked on a different path that just wasn't followed. It appeared as if the final climax was coming and then somehow the producers ran out of money so they just wrapped the film with whatever footage they had.As it stands, the movie is incomplete so I can't give it more than a 5. Had there been an additional 20 minutes or more, I probably would have given it a 6.5 or 7.This movie should have been titled The Devil Inside: Part 1.Where the heck is the last half?!",

I, for one, thought it was a nifty, if lean, take on two genres -- the fake documentary and the demonic possession/exorcism film. The writing is good, the characters (especially of the two young priests) interesting, and the acting solid. It is genuinely creepy/scary in places. Fernanda Andrade's attractive presence only helps, especially when she addresses the \"documentary\" camera with those lovely brown eyes of hers.This film is not big-budget blockbuster entertainment.

As always with horror as a genre, even the most unimaginative movie will find staunch supporters, such is the case with this here picture from William Brent Bell. That's not to sarcastically put down those who enjoy it, for without doubt some do find any form of demonic possession in movies as being terrifying, but in a movie that runs at under 80 minutes, there's under ten minutes of unease, chills or possession based terror. Yes a couple of scenes hold the tingle on the spine, and true enough to say that Suzan Crowley as Maria Rossi acts superbly, but what about the rest of it? The structure and formula is tired, there's no attempt to spin something new into the demonic possession market, while the ending is undoubtedly as bad a cop-out as you may have heard it is.Cribbing from any number of movies that are far better, devoid of a sense of build up and sustaining of atmosphere, it is what it is. A lazy cash cow aimed at a small niche in the horror fan universe who find the thematics reason enough to get involved with it.

The plot was clear in the beginning, but still beyond ridiculous. A girl is trying to have her mother brought back to the US from a sanitarium in Rome. Mom was the subject of an exorcism and killed everyone that was attempting to exorcise her. She was found not guilty by reason of insanity and, for some reason, was sent to Rome. This is the beginning of the stupidity. The daughter is trying to visit mom, and bring her back to the US. Because why wouldn't she want to bring her deranged mother, who doesn't remember her, and is a murderer, back to the states. No reason as to why she's trying to pull that off. She meets with her mother and realizes she needs another exorcism, with no other information given, she just knows mommy needs to have another chance to murder a bunch of people. Are you following this? Its so stupid I almost got up and walked out. She finds a few rogue priests that like to perform their own exorcisms, without the consent of the church, to help her with her mother. Just writing this crap makes me want to throw up, which I did after paying $10 for this garbage. The exorcism is real awful, nothing scary whatsoever. Then, one by one, everyone that witnessed her exorcism becomes a new host for Satan. This could've been a great film, but the acting is atrocious, the plot was shaky at best, and the ending is simply a joke.

I have a deep love and appreciation for horror movies and I am very careful about which ones I spend money on in theaters watching. Not just because there are so many released every year that aren't worth the money to go see but because I can't stand the teenagers that ruin the experience in the theater for me so I just don't go most of the time. Just like all of you people, I read the terrible reviews given to this film by not just critics (because they are PAID to have an opinion) but the viewers and audience members were really mad about the ending. Needless to say that almost kept me from going to see this movie. This movie was in no way deserving of the negative and harsh reviews people are giving it. It seriously upsets me that good films are thrown in the trash because of ignorant people that have no business reviewing horror films. It is true that there are loose ends in this film. Like for instance the fact that they are in Italy and all the priests she hangs out with are English speaking with no accents, they do not take the time to develop the characters in a detailed degree and they don't even attempt to explain a lot of things that lead them through the plot. It is true, this film leaves a lot of questions unanswered. How is that something to be mad about? This is a horror movie, they are aiming to scare you, to shock you, to disgust you, they don't have to explain ANYTHING! In all reality the things that you don't see and the things they don't explain are usually the things that end up sticking with you the longest. For instance in the Blair Witch, we don't know what happens at the end really do we? All we see is dude standing up against the wall and then chick gets knocked out. We don't KNOW what happened. We THINK we know what is GOING to happen. THAT IS WHAT MAKES IT SCARY. NOT KNOWING IS SCARY! COMING UP WITH YOUR OWN TWISTED CONCLUSION IS ALWAYS FAR SCARIER THAN ANYTHING THAT ANOTHER PERSON CAN SHOW YOU IN A FILM. That is where knowing stops and imagination begins. We are as an American audience that is so used to having information spoon fed to us that we cannot invest any time actually thinking or investigating something. Idiots. That is what all you low-balling one star rating people are. IDIOTS.This movie has several wonderful scare scenes. My girlfriend crushed my hand during the first exorcism scene. That girl moved her body like she was truly possessed. Totally freaked us out when period blood started spewing from her crotch. Another cool part was when the demon finally left her and her entire body flew up in the air. Man.....that was awesome. Another sweet part was the part with the priest and the baptism of the baby. Dude. I did not think they would really have dude try to kill a baby in the movie. THEY WENT THERE. Not many horror movies go there just out of courtesy to the audience. This movie is like a honey badger it doesn't give a sheet. Oh yeah, it has priest drown a baby in a baptismal. Very shocking. VERY DISTURBING. Especially when he stares into the lens of the camera as he does it. That gave me nightmares. The part when the priest comes back to the house and what happens is really scary. One more thing before I end this rant. THE ENDING MADE SENSE YOU IDIOTS NEED TO WATCH THE MOVIE AGAIN. Yes it was very abrupt and we weren't expecting them to die like that but they did. The end result of the film gave me a feeling of absolute defeat. This group of demons were so powerful, they didn't stand a chance. Think back to the moment when the one priest is possessed and the other one is telling that priest that he can overcome these demons and stop them from killing them. He just cries and cries and says he can't and eventually blows his brains out right after delivering a line that gave me goosebumps. You know this movie was good. You just didn't like the ending because it wasn't a blockbuster grand finale of special effects that climaxes like a pig coming for the last thirty minutes. Stop crying, go wipe your crack and watch the movie again.The only part that I would have changed would be (like some of you other legit horror fans have said) making the mothers role a little bit more involved with the plot or even bringing her back at the end. She is the focus of the movie and the way the plot ends up directed towards the daughter and the priests and move away from the original story just confuses people and it irritates them and irritated audience members usually end up drawing unfair conclusions at the end of the film and give it crappy reviews because they didn't pay attention to the movie because they were irritated at the beginning. They should have thought about that. Plus, I thought she was amazing as an actress. She blew me away during that initial meeting scene when she starts talking about the aborted baby and screams at Isabella. That scene alone should make you guys really think about what you are saying when you give this movie a one star rating! I honestly think you people have no love for the horror genre and have no business talking crap about this movie. Shut up.:(",

She travels to the Centrino Hospital for the Criminally Insane in Italy where her mother has been locked away to determine if her mother is mentally ill or demonically possessed. When she recruits two young exorcists to cure her mom using unconventional methods combining both science and religion, they come face-to-face with pure evil in the form of four powerful demons possessing Maria. Many have been possessed by one; only one has been possessed by many. (Paramount Pictures)Just recently, Paramount Pictures was named the studio that topped the 2011 box office above all the other major studios. If they want any more people to show up to their films in 2012, they should stop green-lighting films like THE DEVIL INSIDE, although dumping it in January seems like the best decision to forget the film ever existed by the end of the year. Yes, the film produces more unintentional laughs than actual scares. Yes, many people will walk out feeling ripped off once the credits roll. And yes, THE DEVIL INSIDE is a bad film, unfortunately, although the incredible red band trailer suggests otherwise. However, the trailer spoils all the \"good,\" jolting parts in the film. Surprise, surprise.As you can tell, there are many problems regarding the film. However, some of the ones that stand out are the incredibly slow pacing and the dull execution. The few, lazy, cheap scares the film has to offer, the only things left to salvage this dreck from a total waste, are few and far between. To say that the film was tedious to watch would be an understatement. Also, the documentary style serves more to harm than help the film, as every scene that should feel spontaneous and authentic, instead, feel rather staged. With the many problems the film has, the film's biggest crime is the abrupt ending, which is like getting slapped in the face. Just as the film is starting to pick up momentum, it ends as if the filmmakers ran out of budget. Note to all filmmakers: You don't want to anger audiences like that.The cast don't do much to help elevate the film either. Fernanda Andrade, the female lead, is merely serviceable although nothing memorable. However, Suzan Crowley, in the few scenes that she's in, is rather good for what she had to work with. I can't say much for the rest of the supporting cast, which includes Simon Quarterman, Evan Helmuth, and Ionut Grama. Grama, in particular, is incredibly bad as he tries to make his reactions and emotions feel real that it comes off as forced and awkward.I suppose the film will open reasonably well in the box office like most found footage films with low budgets and make a cheap buck before disappearing off in the world. However, I'm here to warn you not to give in to what appears to be a fun, scary night at the movie theater. It's a slow, dull film with barely any scares at all. Yes, the potential for the idea is there, but the execution is just bad. THE EXORCIST this is not.",

            "content": "The horror chiller \"The Devil Inside\" gives movies about exorcism a bad name. Face it, William Friedkin's \"The Exorcist\" (1973) still ranks as the best exorcist movie of all time. No other horror movie can match this landmark movie, least of all its lackluster sequels. Nevertheless, Hollywood continues to crank out new movies about exorcism as if Friedkin's \"The Exorcist\" had lost its vitality. Warner Brothers did the next best thing; they re-released Friedkin's frightening film back in 2010 in a revamped version that performed well at the box office. Lately, three exorcism movies have appeared. Sir Anthony Hopkins starred in \"The Rite\" back in the spring of 2011, and it emerged as a respectable hair-raiser. \"The Rite\" bore a PG-13 rating so it had little bite. The low-budget, Louisiana-set, yell-bent yarn \"The Last Exorcism\" preceded \"The Rite\" by several months, but it contained more irony than thrills. Now, Paramount Pictures has released writer & director William Brent Bell's \"The Devil Inside,\" another misguided entry in the pseudo-documentary genre. Like the \"Paranormal Activity\" trilogy, \"The Devil Inside\" sets out to enhance its simulated verisimilitude by featuring a character that films the action as it unfolds. Sadly, none of the subtlety and artistry which made the \"Paranormal Activity\" epics so taut appears in this mercifully brusque 87-minute nonsense. Worse, \"The Devil Inside\" regales us with lukewarm exorcism scenes and overwrought performances. You know an exorcism movie is in trouble when a barking dog provides its scariest moment.Attractive Isabella Rossi (Brazilian-born actress Fernanda Andrade of \"Why Am I Doing This?\") is the adult daughter of Maria Rossi (Suzan Crowley of \"Wild about Harry) who went bonkers back in 1989. \"The Devil Inside\" opens with Maria's cryptic 911 phone conversation and her confession that she has killed two priests and a nun during an exorcism. Afterward, we're treated to a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the gory crime scene; detectives wander through the blood-splattered residence in confidential footage mocked up to resemble grainy, old VHS tape. Later, Maria convinces the jury that she went insane, and she winds up heavily sedated in an asylum in Rome. The film fast-forwards to 2009. A grown-up Isabella, who was just a child when her mother slaughtered the priests, hires documentary filmmaker Michael Schaefer (Ionut Grama of \"The Whistleblower\") to chronicle her mom's case. Basically, she wants to prove whether her mom is possessed by a demon or mentally ill. Isabella and Michael fly to Rome to visit Maria. While she is in the Eternal City, Isabella sits in on a lecture about exorcism at a Catholic school for exorcists. Afterward, she meets with a couple of clerics, Father Ben Rawlings (Simon Quarterman of \"The Scorpion King: Rise of a Warrior\") and Father David Keane (Evan Helmuth of \"Fever Pitch\"), who have been conducting exorcisms secretly without the church's blessing. Rawlings tells Isabella to forgo any more exorcist lectures. Indeed, he invites her to an exorcist with David and him. Isabella's first exorcism occurs in the basement of a house in Rome. Rawlings and Keane use a number of gadgets to assist them. They outfit their patients with a heart monitor and photograph the size of their pupils to determine how crazy that they are. The young Italian girl, Rosa (Bonnie Morgan of \"Piranha\"), who they deal with spews some profanity and has her period. At one point, she breaks her bonds and scrambles up a wall like a roach, but the priests cast out the devil. Isabella is now prepared to meet her mom.Maria surprises Isabella when she reminds her daughter that an abortion that she consented to years before won't put her in God's good graces. Predictably, Isabella is shocked by this revelation from somebody who hasn't seen her in twenty years. Later, the Fathers hook Maria up to their gadgets, and she surprises them. Not only does she utter epithets in several tongues, but she also clobbers Father Rawlings and sends him reeling clean across the room. Nothing that either Isabella or the Fathers do convinces the Vatican to review Maria's case. As it turns out, the Vatican has washed its hands of the Rossi family. This surprises our protagonists despite the fact that Maria killed three ordained exorcists back in 1989. Meantime, Father Keane begins to feel paranoid, and he has good reason. The devil inside Maria has taken residence up in him! Unfortunately, this creates chaos of another kind that is calculate to make you cackle rather than cringe. Keane tries to drown a baby during a baptism and later relieves a Roman cop of his pistol and uses it on himself. Meantime, Michael is speechless at everything that he has lensed.\"The Devil Inside\" isn't scary. The closest that Bell's film gets to scary is creepy. The last shot is a website where presumably all the answers can be found. Ultimately, however, creepy often becomes campy. The disclaimer at the outset that \"the Vatican does not endorse this movie\" shouldn't come as any surprise. Nothing in this pedestrian horror movie will either make your head spin or spew up green pea soup. Worse, Bell and co-producer Michael Peterman wrap up everything far too quickly with an abrupt ending. We're told to check out their website www.TheRossiFiles.com. Believe me, this is no way to end a movie, but then \"The Devil Inside\" isn't worth a pitch fork.",

It was quite entertaining and I thought they handled the, far too commonly used, documentary style relatively well, aside from the annoying acting of the cameraman.It sets up the story well enough and the majority of the characters are entertaining. I did not find myself feeling very scared by the film but this is common enough for myself and horror films, but I was quite entertained by the film waiting to see where it went.The story was developing nicely with the introduction into the world of exorcisms and discussing problems with the church's approach to them, I was feeling quite engaged. Then they finally establish the mother is possessed...as everyone knew anyway...and they go off to put their case to the church to do an exorcism, but this is made into a thing that they will have to fight for.Surely with this being set up, the viewer can expect a big climax in the form of the mother's exorcism? ... Nope. Instead the demon bounces around the characters in fairly boring fashion and kills them all...Worst ending to a horror film I think I have ever seen. To make it even worse, they stick in a website at the end to say go to this website to find out more about this unsolved case...this website is no longer online and when it was online was in fact just a promotional website for the film.It is an insult to the viewers. This film looks as if the makers ran out of budget halfway through the film and just decided they end it with what they'd filmed. It can hardly even be called an ending.Steer clear of this film! Waste of time! And an insult to the viewer!",

            "content": "There have been a great many films featuring exorcisms, and a lot of them pale in comparison to William Peter Blatty's 1973 film because a) there are only so many ways you can feature an exorcism, and b) that film has been banned in various medias on many occasions earning it a well deserved notoriety that is near impossible to topple.Where 'The Devil Inside' succeeds is that it follows the renegade priests who perform the ceremonies, alongside Isabella Rossi (Fernanda Andrade) as they try to keep up with various possessions, and makes them the focal points instead of the victim(s). Their main mission is helping Isabella's mother, Maria (Suzan Crowley), but that doesn't mean we're not treated to other examples of bulging-eyes and bone-popping as demonic forces rip through their unfortunate victims.This is also a 'found footage' film, which adds a further frenetic energy to proceedings - otherwise known as shaky camera syndrome. Some don't care for this genre, but I think that, if used well, it is still a very effective way of telling a story, from a personal viewpoint impossible to achieve with a more traditional approach. There's even a little self-awareness in the script: \"I'm the annoying guy with the camera,\" the film-maker says at one point.I found 'The Devil Inside' thoroughly entertaining and occasionally visually shocking. Good to know also, that a production of this type can still provoke controversy from those eager to complain; the abruptness of the finale has caused some comment, but it works really well, I think: sometimes, there should be no happy ending. Not everyone was impressed, causing co-writer to actually spoon-feed his critics with a defence, saying, 'Sometimes real life doesn't follow a perfect structure. Things aren't always wrapped up and resolved when or how you'd like them to be.' That he should need to explain his creative decision is courteous, but exposes the power of 'the moaners'. Stuff 'em! My score is 8 out of 10.",

Well, I think it ended in my watchlist after I read some articles about catholic church's actual exorcisms that they even to this day conduct, though very rarely. I think that is an interesting topic, and I read this movie is to some extent inspired by true events. Well, that's a claim many horror movies make but it doesn't usually mean much.The documentary style at first distracted me because I wondered if some of the clips are from actual events (newsflashes and interviews). But I soon came to a conclusion it must be all staged for this movie. I like actual documentaries a lot, but in this case it felt a bit weird to watch one that is not real. Then again, if the Vatican doesn't allow to make a real documentary, it somehow makes sense to make one that is staged. And I started to like it for what it is. At least it is a fresh new take to the subject and not another Conjuring style basic horror film.I wouldn't rush to watch it again but I must say the movie kept me somewhat interested during its short running time. I might recommend it to those who are really fascinated about the subject matter.",

            "content": "You may remember the films The Fourth Kind and The Last Exorcism, pretending to be like some kind of realistic looking documentary with haunted houses and possessed people, but they just fails to convince or grip you, well this film is very reminiscent. Basically, on 30 October 1989, in South Hartford, Maria Rossi (Suzan Crowley) was arrested and sentenced to stay in South Hartford State Asylum, because two years previously she committed the murders of two priests and a nun, apparently while an exorcism was being performed on her, and some months later she was transferred to Centrino Mental Hospital in Italy. Twenty years later, Isabella Rossi (Fernanda Andrade), twenty five year old daughter of Maria, is making a documentary about exorcisms, and so she can find out more about her mother, and she is introduced to the process by priests Father Ben Rawlings (Simon Quarterman) and Father David Keane (Evan Helmuth). She joins them as they attempt to exorcise a demon from Rosalita/Rosa Sorlini (Bonnie Morgan), bringing medical equipment to determine if her behaviour is possession or mental illness, she is attacking, self-harming and shouting obscene comments in different languages and accents, she even speaks unknown Isabella's name, until they stop her. Isabella goes to visit her mother in the asylum, she has covered her walls in paintings, she can speak other languages and accents, and she has carved her own skin with crucifixes, including on her bottom lip, and her mother mentions that killing children is against God, and there is no way she would know her daughter had an abortion years ago. Maria is taken to have another exorcism performed on her, but the church does not approve the process without evidence of demonic possession, and during the procedure she breaks out of her restraints and throws Ben and David around, until the doctors come in to help the situation. All of this was filmed on camera and recorded for sound, and they present the evidence to the church, Ben and David both listen to and watch the footage again and again finding some meaning in the words and actions of Maria, in fact four demon voices were speaking, and soon another evil spirit appears during a baptism inside of Michael 'Mike' Schaefer (Ionut Grama), he tries to submerge the baby in the water before passing out. After this it appears that David himself may be the next victim to have a demon inside of him, as Ben finds him covered in blood, ranting and raving, the police arrive and he grabs an officer's gun and threatens to kill himself, and after attempting the words to The Lord's Prayer he shoots himself, and also watching Isabella has a seizure. Hysterical Ben realises soon that Isabella too is possessed, and in the hospital she causes a nurse to bleed and heavily and is attacking many others trying to restrain her, Ben and Michael take her away and get help for a possible exorcism, but while driving she attacks again and causes the car to go out of control, travelling into busy traffic, and the camera recording cuts out, the footage only returning in moments to see them all going through the windscreen. Also starring Brian Johnson as Lieutenant Dreyfus, John Prosky as Father Christopher Aimes, Claudiu Istodor as Doctor Antonio Costa and Claudiu Trandafir as Father Robert Gallo. The cast of unknown actors is pretty dull, even leading actress Andrade as the investigative filmmaker, the plot is nothing new and the \"found footage\" idea is predictable and silly, I admit a couple of the exorcism scenes have freaky and interesting enough moments, but that is not enough, and the film has a terrible ending and boring scenes in-between the action, it is not scary, not original and not worth seeing at all, a terrible supernatural horror thriller.

            "content": "The Devil Inside (1:23, R) \u2014 fantasy: supernatural, bargain basement, formulaThe annual movie calendar cycles between feast and famine. There are 2 periods every year (Thanksgiving to the Super Bowl and the 1st half-dozen weeks of summer) when there's an abundance of wonderment everywhere you look. Not at all coincidentally, these fertile periods correspond to potential audiences having extra time off work and school. The December crest also has 2 other things going for it: (1) the holiday spending fever and (2) Hollywood's probably accurate perception that Academy Award voters have exceedingly short attention spans, so better save the really good stuff for the end of the year, so it's still fresh in their minds (and possibly even still playing in nearby theaters) come nomination time.But if those 2 bountiful stretches are like the lush Amazon rain forest, the months of January and February are like the Sahara Desert. The big holiday blockbusters still dominate the multiplex, and the films that were your 4th or 5th choices back when school let out are still the major attractors at the box office as people finally get around to seeing them. But some of the older releases have reached their sell-by date, the last reasonable nickel having been wrung out of them, and it's time for the available prints to head off to the cheap theaters, the boondocks, lucky foreign lands, or even just the vaults, to avoid competing with the upcoming DVD releases.The na\u00efve would hope that the ax would fall first on the most deserving, such as The Darkest Hour or anything featuring vocal vermin. Ha. It is to laff. No, the primary target is the family- friendly animated stuff. (Kids are back in school, you know.) Thus this weekend we bid adieu to Happy Feet 2 (released Nov. 18) and Arthur Christmas (Nov. 23).Taking their places in the 40-seat auditoria are the low-stakes placeholders \u2014 featuring nobody you've ever heard of and production companies that purchased their transitory domain names from GoDaddy last June \u2014 that can probably recoup their production costs in the 1st week just from curiosity seekers (plus completists such as myself), before word of mouth gets out. Which brings us, after the foregoing shucking and jiving, to the subject of today's review, the unimaginative, formulaic exorcism flik The Devil Inside.The opening title cards solemnly assure us that, however many atrocities may be laid at the feet of the Catholic Church, this is not one of them. (They don't phrase it that way, of course.) I think this disclaimer is supposed to establish the \"documentary's\" rebel vibe \u2014\u00a0unofficial, unsanctioned by authority, the real story of demonic possession that the hierarchy doesn't want you to know.Ostensibly in late 2009, the \"documentarian\" follows a young woman across the sea to Italy, where her insane mother is being held in an asylum run by Catholic officialdom. Mom had offed 3 clergyfolk as they were trying to exorcise her back in 1989, and we're supposed to believe that the US was happy to be rid of her. Thus we get to see establishing shots of Rome as filmed thru the window of a moving vehicle and are later treated to ordinary Italians who speak a few subtitled words in their native language before unaccountably breaking out in spontaneous fits of English. The gal and her cameraman are soon joined by 2 ninja exorcists, Fathers Ben Rawlings (young, unshaven, British accent) and David Keane (older, fleshier, apparently American), who are studying at the Vatican's School of Exorcism but getting in lots of unsanctioned homework on the local population of possessees.They bicker between themselves as to how to tell the difference between someone who really is hosting a demon vs. merely the mentally ill, or somebody faking it for some unknown reason. Hint #1: There is no such thing as demonic possession, because there are no such things as demons. Hint #2: If there were, the dead giveaway is the Attack of the Lavender Eye Shadow.To give the illusion of authenticity, the movie makers employ the hand-held camera technique pioneered by The Blair Witch Project and actually done fairly well by Cloverfield. But those were done for the sake of art, with some deftness. Here it's just an early production decision, and once they get started, they don't let up, beating the gimmick to death with excessive wiggling and jiggling. The most incompetent documentarian in history \u2014 like, say, your dim 9-year-old cousin recording for posterity how he persuaded his even dimmer 7-year-old brother to ride his bicycle off the garage roof \u2014 had better camera work than this.Yada yada yada, screams, blood, contortions, self-doubt, recriminations, suicide, thankfully only a single cheap-thrill jumpatcha (hey, dog wranglers cost money, y'know), speaking in tongues, incredibly incompetent hospital management, inverted crosses carved into flesh, more cameras with improbable vantages, yada yada yada, scream, grab, more death, the end.On the unfathomable chance that you actually LIKE this sort of tripe, you'll probably feel gypped. The movie's run time of 1:23 was padded out by the slowest-moving end-credit crawl since the projector broke back in '73. You could probably have TYPED the credits out faster than they scrolled up the screen. (I know, I know, \"The food was terrible, and the portions were so small.\") This exceeds the \"dime a minute\" standard that you should be willing to pay for the very best.Why, then, that 2nd star? Bad as it was, it might have been worse. For a blessing, it didn't have a single singing rodent.",

She is sent over to Italy because the Vatican wants her for reasons that the media doesn't know. Twenty years later, Isabella (Fernanda Andrade) and Mike (Ionut Grama), the filmmaker, travels to Rome because she wants to know more about her mother and gathering information regarding of exorcism. Upon arriving she meets two priest Ben (Simon Quarterman) and David (Evan Helmuth) who has experience performing exorcism. They both agree to perform it, but they know there is a price to pay.The Content: Many of my friends have begged me not to see film due to the fact that they hate it. My job is to review films, no matter what people say because it is my hobby. The Devil Inside is an unholy mess. The only thing that I personally had no problem was the acting. It's not the best nor the worst, but its right there. Everything else was a complete disaster waiting to happen. First off, in order to get the audience attention, you need a plot that either makes sense or to make it interesting to the end. That was not the case for this film. One issue was that it failed to focus on the main plot when it was suppose to. Instead it mainly focused on the subplot, which is a big no-no. As an experience writer, you should not focus on your sub-plot as much, however you can show it or tell it, but mainly the screenwriters should have pay attention to the main plot. On top of fact, how many exorcism movies are out there? A lot and that is the problem because the audience is already recognizing the whole plot structure and you know where it is going to happen from A to Z. The hardest thing to do in modern cinemas is to scare the audiences. The main reason why it doesn't work anymore is due to the fact that it is getting repetitive. Let say it the movie came out in 1970s, than it would have shocking values but because were so used to it, it's not the same. Another issue that I came across was the pacing. Sure, it may be only 86 minutes, but it was the longest 86 minutes of my life. It dragged was due to the lost of interest. The only way I can see 86 minutes passing by is to do two things: the interest of the characters and again the plot. For example, in Alien (I recommend everyone to check this movie out) the film is slow but because it has good characters development and an interesting story, the film achieves well paced. This movie does not. The hardest thing to do in films is to end a movie. The Devil Inside will go down in history as one of the worst endings in film history. Never in my life have I laughed so hard because how terrible the ending was. The audience was slap in the face, which obliviously no one wants to experience. If you want me to tell you the ending, it will be a pleasure, otherwise just skipped to the next paragraph.Isabella is possessed. Ben wants to take her to another priest after his friends David killed himself. Mike is driving in the car along with Ben and Isabella. She is soon awaken and attacks Mike, but regains consensuses, but he shows sign of possession as well. He crashes the car and the screen goes black with some cuts showing chaos as the car tumbles. Then it cuts complete back and says this \"The Rossi family case remain unsolved. For more information, go to www.therossifiles.com. What kind of ending is that?The Verdict: The Devil Inside is already my candidate as the worst film of the year, and the sad part is that it's the first film of 2012. The only way anybody can sit through is to make fun of it. This movie should be burning in hell where it belongs.F-",

The camera man is clearly \"non-intelligent\" to the extreme, who's \"technique\" was so distracting, the film is impossible to watch. I sincerely hope this shaky cam stuff comes to an end as I personally can't stand it. It's also unfortunate this horrible release made more than a dime.

The Paranormal Activity comparison is odd. One, Paranormal Activity was filmed as more of a \"Mock-Home Video\" than a \"Mockumentary\" like The Devil Inside. The ending of Paranormal was more exciting and puzzling because you knew there'd be a sequel. Why a sequel? Because the creators are going to keep taking people's money. This ended because that's the thing: it's The End. No \"there goes the demon out the front door to do more carnage.\" The filming is more stable because, the plot going along with this, an actual cameraman is operating it. Outrageous, I know. Also, it followed along more closely with actual demonology as taught by the church among other beliefs, where as Paranormal Activity was far more fictional and created out of the writer's imagination. I would recommend watching it without high expectations, but don't avoid it just because a bunch of people who can't sit still for an hour and a half and enjoy a good story gave it a bad rating.",

Its nothing ground breaking and it is your average found footage film. Although I found the concept they implied to be quite original. The mixture of science and religion shown in the film is quite unique. It represents what you might imagine modern exorcists actually doing.The film itself did have its share of scares. I personally find movies of this type to be really scary. Just the thought of this happening to someone is a terrifying thought alone. The execution was good. You are taken into the underworld of Rome. Behind closed doors of stuff that might actually be going on. Yes the plot was not extremely strong but the acting for this type of film wasn't bad at all. I never once lost focus on the movie because of bad acting or seemingly scripted lines.The Ending. I won't give away exactly what happens. The movie throughout does foreshadow this a lot so I saw it coming. A lot of people are complaining and saying it was a terrible way to end the movie. I was expecting something much worse. I will admit there could have been a lot more closure in the ending of this film. There are a lot of things we would have liked to see happen. The ending had a lot of potential to be excellent and I could have thought of about ten better ways to end it. It just so happens though that I am not the director of this film nor the writer. There are plenty of good films with not so good endings. Except it for what it is and just enjoy the movie. Did it make me turn away? Yes. Will I sleep with the light on tonight?

After a genuinely creepy opening segment, however, it gradually starts to fall apart and ends up being an ultra-familiar and, in the end, disappointing movie.The problem with the film is the story, or lack of it. It follows a group of rookie priests who perform various exorcisms, and the narrative is tenuously tied together by the presence of a pretty young woman who's attempting to help her mother, herself a victim of possession. The trouble is, it all plays out exactly as you'd expect, with nary a surprise along the way.It goes without saying that the two exorcism scenes are genuinely disturbing, but that's only because they slavishly copy the EXORCIST formula without adding much in the way of new stuff; it also strikes me that the limb-breaking stuff has been done before in THE LAST EXORCISM or elsewhere. And as the film gets on, it gets worse, until it ends up being just people running around and screaming instead of compelling viewing. It comes up short and abrupt at the end, reinforcing my opinion that the writers ran out of steam.",

Why bother with this facade if you are completely moronic when it comes to documentaries? WIthin the first 20 minutes we see a number of instances that break the film's own rules. First of all the girl starts asking about the cameras in the car. No documentary would include this moment, it's just an example of a fake documentary reminding you of what it's supposed to be. Next, a doctor walks down a doctor sneaks up on the protagonist with no sounds of footsteps, a second later he starts walking and yes, we hear footsteps again. Then we have a set-up in a room where we see CCTV and no cameraman, and suddenly footage from the cameraman's perspective. Is he invisible? Does he run in and out of the room? Hell if I know. It gets no better with the awful performances and idiotic characters. They act as though this is a normal scripted narrative, and forget to be real. I'm guessing zero amount of improvisation went into this film. Later we also see blood splat on the camera lens and then it vanishes. It isn't wiped away, it just disappears. Finally we get to the end. Well, actually we don't. There is no end to this film. It just finishes and gives you a website link to \"read up on the case\". Would you like to do that once you've wasted your money? No, didn't think so. Make sure this film dies a horrible and painful death. It truly is disgusting, and doesn't even bother to try and entertain.

OK, I admit, some ideas have been used before, for example, the demon passing on to someone else (Fallen, with Denzel Washinton, great film) The acting was very good, especially from the mother. I'm also really glad about the decreased voice effects from the demon which made it more realistic.The ending I did think was a bit rubbish, but it didn't ruin it for me.So go and see it by all means and go with an open mind.

It is a lame supernatural thriller about the presence of evil, such as the way they market this crap. It begins with promise featuring a 911 call where an apparent exorcism concluded with several dead bodies. Now the possessed is in Italy or Rome, or some bloody place where they shacked her up in a rubber room, and her dimwitted daughter decides to document her visit after twenty years. This cannot end well for these morons nor the audience who has to sit through it. Director William Brent Bell strikes up tremendous images of Rome and Italy and such but he cannot save the actors from themselves. When Fernanda Andrade, who plays the daughter, becomes possessed, any so-called true story account goes straight down the shitter with any other brilliant logic the screenwriter concocted during a night of heavy drinking. There are two pea brain Priests, one who becomes possessed and attempts to drown a baby during a baptism. Then there is the mother who cuts herself and likely removed herself from any Mother's Day card delivery. Either that or she just became so upset at this career move that she attempts suicide to remove the embarrassment. We witness the twitching and distorted possessed bodies who are in such agony, nobody is in more agony than the poor saps viewing its spectacle. Score: 4 / 10",

It is possession porn ripped right out of the frames of The Exorcist, Blair Witch, The Rite, and Paranormal Activity. Like last summer's The Last Exorcism, it's a found footage, faux documentary, demon drama, this time about a young woman, Isabella Rossi (Fernanda Andrade), who goes to Italy to find her mother, Maria (Suzan Crowley), who was placed in Rome's Centrino Hospital for the Criminally Insane (I don't know why there and probably nobody else knows) after she allegedly murdered three people during her own exorcism.The series of unauthorized exorcisms Isabella becomes involved in to understand her mother's crime are boilerplate movie mosh ups using the same foul language (\"The pig is mine!\"), the same rude force hurtling people around the room, and no resolution or understanding of what forces are at work here, beyond the bland \"devil.\"If you must see this drivel, you must stay until the end to see one of the lamest conclusions ever in film.

I had some expectation for this movie and it was a bust. I was expecting something along the lines of \"The Last Exorcism\" which I found to be entertaining at least. That just isn't the case for this movie. For a found footage movie this just isn't believable at all and it tries to go in a direction like the stuff that happened on camera really happened. The beginning it starts out slightly creepy but than on majority of the way through is boring stuff constantly. People just rambling on about exorcism and it isn't anything new, interesting or innovative. In fact after just few minutes in I saw couple of audiences leave which was actually a smart move. I never left during a movie in a theater yet, but was close to doing it. The research they done for this movie was off and ridiculous which is fine for some movies but they try to go in a direction like this really happened which makes it not work. I won't even bother talking about the plot cause there really isn't much to it at all. To put it simply a women is mentally unstable or possessed and kills three people and end up in a mental asylum. Than her daughter does a documentary with two priest and a camera man on exorcism. The character decisions in this movie doesn't make much sense and the acting gets a bit too over the top and dramatic. Simon Quarterman who I saw for the first time was alright and the exorcism scenes was creepy and even a bit eerie although it's very few. The priests in this movie bash the Vatican church system but they smoke and swear, which might work if this is going in the similar direction as \"Constantine\" or \"Dylan Dog\" it might have worked. But for a movie like this nothing really works. I am so glad this movie isn't long and there will be no controversy with the Vatican church over this movie. The ending will also probably tick some audiences off, if anyone can even call it a ending. It just builds to the main point and ends.3.3/10",

Except, it wasn't just the worst horror film of the year, it was the worst film period. What. Even. Was. This!? A woman investigates her mother's murder spree twenty years ago, when she soon becomes involved in a series of exorcisms. I...I can't quite describe how diabolical this generic piece of rubbish is. It honestly achieved the unachievable. A horror film so tame, that it made Miley Cyrus' smash hit \"Can't Be Tamed\" ironically less tame.

A production so derivative, that it will leave you gasping for air, not due to fear, but because you are suffocating yourself in an attempt to end this nightmare. Yes, asphyxiation is the only solution, I said it. It seriously encompasses every modern horror trope, from standard formulaic exorcisms to the found footage style narrative. Brent Bell's choppy directing and lifeless approach hindered the cast's performances which were dull to say the least. Jump scares were infrequent (yay!) and calming (nay!) with the entire plot being a predictable bore. A script so dire that, I kid you not, there was a line that compared an exorcist to Superman. Sure. I'll bite. Let's see if a member of the church can withstand a bullet to the head, that'll raise a religious outcry. I mean, what a stupid thing to say! But that's not all, ohhhh no.

She lacked a lot in character depth, and the film did not deal with the existential questions she might have about her future, the future of her mother, and her family. The facade of a \"documentary\" is easily broken after about two or three scenes featuring Isabella, as her believability and presence are akin to those of a poorly written fan- fiction character, possibly even worse.

There were only three scenes featuring Maria Rossi, Isabella's mother, whose possession seemed, at first, to be the central plot of the film, but she is never revisited after one attempt at exorcism.There is more \"intrigue\" about two priests who are \"vigilante exorcists\" and who are performing exorcisms against the will of the Vatican. I found this idea laughable, and somewhat clever at best. It made the film even less believable and these character's presences made the others even less relatable because of their unrealistic reactions to the various dangerous, and frankly traumatic situations the priests get the protagonists into.Although this film contains one of the most graphic suicide scenes I've seen to date, which may intrigue some people. In summation (tl;dr) crappy Paranormal Activity with fewer ghosts and more priests, poorly written and developed characters, many loose ends, and an attempt at an ending that would make viewers think, but ultimately just made the film worse.",

            "content": "Now I wanted to come up with a clever title but realising that the moment you put something along he lines of 'OMG 2 hours of my life back please' as your title it just makes you seem like the most elitest **** ever.Lets talk about the big thing first, it's not scary. Some may say thats subjective but honestly, people don't seem to get the fact that waiting for something to go bang and being scary are not the same thing. They both make you feel tense but waiting for the next loud noise to come never unnerves you, makes you feel vulnerable or lets your imagination do anything apart from wonder what form the next 'boo' was coming.That being said there were 2 moments in which the film actually remembered it was a horror instead of being a succession of party poppers being let off at random intervals. First was the 'Connect the cuts' moments as seen in the trailer which managed to be unnerving but was handling the rest of that scene so badly it almost stooped into the realms of comedy.The second was the scene after the baptism (no spoilers) where there was a genuine sense of overhanging dread before and after the big bang came. That would have meant nothing to you if you haven't seen the film but, in short, there are two relatively scary moments in the film and the rest borders on comical in how hard it tries to creep the audience out.A film trying this hard to be realistic, what with the real world setting, the faux documentary style etc is always make or break in the acting department. You know where this is going. The acting isn't exceptionally bad but rather uninspiring and completely devoid of enthusiasm no matter how many times each character gets thrown across a room or cries. You would think that after witnessing an actual demon be extracted from someone that it would leave a lasting impression on the sceptical protagonist. Maybe she would start to doubt and re-evaluate everything she has taken for granted until now? If there are demons could there be such thing as ghosts? Aliens? How much do we really matter in the overall scheme of things if these higher powers actually exist? Are we really disposable pawns in the overall battle between good and evil?Well you and I know what I'm getting at so I'll just end this by saying that about five minutes after the encounter she is looking over the recorded footage making passing judgement about the size of the victims pupils with the futility of someone commenting on a picture of Jesus's crusty face on the bottom of a senile ladies frying pan in on their local magazine.The ending is bad. A woeful cop-out 'to be continued' but never will be because of how bad the film is ending pretty much sums it up. Abrupt and so completely out of nowhere in an attempt to be shocking that as the credits rolled, someone in the audience of about 10 people on a Wednesday afternoon including me and a friend actually stood up and said \"really?\" which led to a greater emotional outburst from the audience than anything the film achieved.The worst thing? I almost fell asleep during the first exorcism. That isn't some snarky brandy swilling, egotistical, made up want to be criticy talk no, I'm dead serious I was nodding of during an exorcism that lasted about 10 minutes but seemed about 30. If thats not a testament to this films failings I don't know what is.The devil inside is either as dull as a powerpoint presentation assembled by a fumbling old history teacher who can't get the projector to work and so has to call one of the school 'techies' to stop him from rubbing the projector with oil, or merely average. the kindest thing you can say is that at least half of this film can be described as the latter.",

I think it really helps to add to the realism.Now on the other hand, I would NOT recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a really big scare. It never gave me that intense and heart-wrenching feeling that I got while watching movies like \"The Exorcist\" and \"Paranormal Activity\". It kind of seems to just beat around the bush the entire movie, in a sense.The worst part of the entire movie, in my opinion, was the ending. After the movie was over, I had a feeling of absolute emptiness. They could have, at the very least, showed what happened to Maria Rossi. Did the demon really leave her? Was she back to normal? Did they survive the car accident? Yes, I'm sure many people are saying \"Well it was a creative and non-clich\u00e9 ending\". While that may be true, you can make a creative ending without leaving so much out. This was probably the worst ending I've ever seen in a movie that started with so much potential. I just felt I never got that really enormous scare that I was waiting for.The bottom line, this movie has so much potential, but I feel it never fully utilizes it, and in the end you leave feeling empty. On the other hand, it does have some really cool information on exorcisms, and some really awesome acting to go with it. There were some really dramatic and intense scenes. I really felt like they were really in that situation and that they weren't even acting at all. Not to mention the way it was presented was really top-notch. Like I said, this movie has a ton of potential, but it seems to just simply fizzle out. I believe it can be enjoyed non-the-less. Although if you want to get a scare out of it, I suggest watching it alone!",

There's an extremely tense scene between Isabella and her mother that will have you on edge the whole time, and while the ending was much loathed by the group of friends I went with, I thought it was a clever ending. Predictable, but clever nonetheless. The film takes a little bit to get going, but when it does it brings you in and if you view it with an open mind, it might actually scare you.

            "content": "If you're an amateur film-goer like myself and you are keen on a simple scare, then the trailer will have dragged you into the cinema for the first viewing of this 'found-footage' first person experience!One of the first things that sprung to mind within the first five minutes of the film was how let down I was with the acting. Now I know it's become 'the thing' to make a 'found-footage' film or a documentary type horror (Paranormal Activity, Fourth Kind, Blair Witch), but if that's the case, then at least make the acting good enough to be believable! If it's a documentary, I don't want to see people creating seconds of suspense between their sentences to each other; this film made me cringe inside at the use of this exactly. Within the first 20 minutes of the film, after a couple of 'jumps', my girlfriend asked me 'Is this real?', I simply replied 'No, look at the acting. You can tell.', to me, it was that simple.I won't be all negative about the film, they had a fairly good storyline to keep up with, they had the effects and such thrown in the right places, however, it seems clear they got carried away with the 'lets see what we can do to make the audience jump' thing, considering this was meant to be a documentary. Walking down the path, out of nowhere, a dog appears and barks at the cast, coincidence for a 'footage' film? I think not and I know it's acting, but the distance between reality and acting grew at this point when all but the cameraman seemed to be scared.****SPOILERS****Here, I'll point out some things I noticed that made it clear to me that this film was definitely more acting than reality and a lot more of 'let's make the audience focus elsewhere for suspense..'(.. despite the fact it's a documentary), firstly, I'll start with the Baptism scene.. what does this have to do with the rest of the film at all? It doesn't, it's there just to add suspense and branch another story off the already fake one. Which is why I knew, as soon as they cut to that scene that something was going to happen, straight away. Okay another one, when Isabella is talking to the camera about Michael, something about 'I wish I could turn this around on him', I instantly noticed half of the screen was facing behind her and the other half was catching what she was saying, now call me psychic, but I predicted something was going to happen behind her and guess what.. it did. If this was a documentary, the character's would've never have focused more on the camera angle where something is about to happen or something that seems completely off the storyline unless you know something's going to happen.. Maybe I'm just being picky? Let's go back to the storyline....So the film builds up, the cast go to Italy, exorcisms happen, people get possessed, see the odd couple of graphic scenes that get your heart beating.. sounding good, yeah? Imagine the film stopping there. Oh wait, it does. If you've read any reviews already, based on the ending, you'll probably know what I'm going to say.. So, the film builds up and you're thinking 'Shit, I wonder what's going to happen!?', well apparently, a typical 'all-cast death' happens, that made the guy behind me comfortably shout 'Fuck off!' when the credits hit. I know this is going to sound typical of me to say, but I saw it coming (okay, not exactly, but hear me out..), during the ending car scene, I noticed that anytime the camera view from the back, facing to the front, had blurred out the characters in view and left only the view through the windshield clear. This to me, instantly said 'something's either going to jump out in front of the car or something's going to happen to the car.', again.. typical of a footage film? Not in my opinion.I'll stop there. If you're in for a clich\u00e9 film based on 'footage', and basically want to see all the typical things that always happen in these type of films where the ending is terrible.. yeah, I'd advise you watch this.",

Along with the help of a couple priests Isabella plans on finding out if exorcism are real and if her mother was ever possessed. THE DEVIL INSIDE is yet another film showing off the \"found footage\" format and I think the entire genre has almost ran its course. I'm not going to call this one of the worst horror films ever made as many have. I'm not going to call the ending one of the worst in the history of cinema like many have. THE DEVIL INSIDE isn't a horrid film or a good one and what really makes me upset at it is how bland and lifeless it is. If you've ever seen a horror movie in your life then you're going to know all the tricks here. This includes quiet moments where the surround sound gets a workout with one of those fake scares from a loud noise. You're going to know when the characters are all gathered around talking while the \"subject\" is calm that the person will then go crazy to try and get another fake scare. The problem is that these fake scares don't even work and the execution of the film really isn't all that impressive. If the fake scares don't work then you know the real ones aren't going to either. I found the film lacking any real atmosphere and I'd say that the entire exorcism plot line is just played out. Nothing fresh or original happens here and it's really not too hard to catch the twist that happens at the end. I will say that I did enjoy the performances with Andrade doing a fine job in the lead. Supporting players Simon Quarterman and Evan Helmuth are also good. THE DEVIL INSIDE is far from being a horrible movie but it's somewhat worse simply because it's bland. At least with bad movies you can have fun with them and that's certainly not the case here.",

Lack of character development inherently draws apathy from movie goers. The supposed scary scenes are not much in comparison with many other movies of the horror genre.However, the main disappointment, is right at the climax of the film, which I shan't spoil for any potential viewers. The audience is abruptly hit with the movie's ending, which leaves very much to be desired. It is as if the structure of the story's beginning, rising action, and climax (yes I said 'climax') is there, but the writer completely forgot the resolution part of what comprises a story.

Unfortunately, Anthony Hopkins is not here to carry this dull-bulbed snoozer.The Devil Inside is about a woman who has questionably become possessed by several entities, and is succumbed to a plethora of exorcisms relating to murders that happened.

            "content": "The subject of possession is one of the most heated and debated topics of our time. Can demons seize control over humans, thereby causing great suffering to both themselves and everyone around them, or is it just mental illness? The Catholic Church would have you believe that latter, but let's face it; some things just cannot be explained, and if there is no such thing as demonic possession, why even train exorcists? Paramount Insurge's new film The Devil Inside tackles these questions while delivering some genuine scares to kick off the new year.It all starts with a chilling phone call to police placed by a woman named Maria Rossi (Crowley). She alerts the authorities that she has slain three people. Upon arriving at her home, the police discover a massacre, and once Rossi is in custody, it becomes really apparent that she's not your ordinary killer. Something is just ... off. So off in fact that instead of being imprisoned, she's shipped off to Italy and locked down in an asylum.Two decades later her daughter, Isabella (Andrade), has some questions about not only her mother and the crimes she has committed but also whether or not her mental illness runs in the family. After digging a bit, it turns out that her mom had killed the three victims while they were performing an exorcism on her. This raises a whole new set of questions, and Isabella is determined to find out exactly what happened that grisly evening and what is currently happening with her mother.To get answers, she and her filmmaker friend, Michael (Grama), travel to the Centrino Hospital for the Criminally Insane in Italy, where her mother has been locked away. Their objective? Figure out if her mother is mentally ill or demonically possessed. While in Rome, our pair meet up with two young exorcists (Quarterman, Helmuth) who convince the duo that in order to understand what is happening with Maria, they first have to understand what possession is. From there our group of truth- seekers end up taking one hell of a ride into the mouth of darkness where science and religion collide into a crescendo of terror.Possession flicks are really hard to pull off effectively because of the shadow of the giant 400-pound gorilla in the room known as The Exorcist. If you go too far, you're ripping it off. If you don't go far enough, your flick is labeled boring. It truly is a damned if you do, damned if you don't kind of problem for a filmmaker to have to face. Thankfully, director William Brent Bell walks the fine line between inspiration and imitation with nary a misstep. The Devil Inside is an effective thriller that's guaranteed to send some solid chills down the spines of audiences. It's only real shortcomings come from the cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 shooting style it utilizes. Though not in abundance, the usual pitfalls of the technique are present and accounted for along with a couple of horror movie clich\u00e9s that serve to temporarily snap you briefly out of the otherwise immersive experience. Yes, sometimes our characters will make questionable choices that will lead to all sorts of bad things, but once you see how well said things are executed, you can for the most part forgive them.For all those out there whose main complaints about cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style films is that the camera is too shaky and you really never see anything, do not worry. The camera work never gets too out of hand, and when the shocks and scares do come, they hit like a punch to the jaw.The film is loaded with nightmarish moments that will have people both shrieking and averting their eyes. A special mention has to go out to Bonnie Morgan, who plays the character of Rosa, and of course Suzan Crowley, who, much like Lorna Raver did in Drag Me to Hell, completely steals the show. These ladies go above and beyond the call of spooky with their performances, and there's no way this flick would have been as effective without them.While not perfect, this tale of possession hits way more than it misses and follows perfectly in the footsteps of the Paranormal Activity franchise, proving that more can be done with passion and imagination than with an inflated budget. The Devil Inside is home to moments that will shock, scare, disturb, and leave you gasping. It's a trip to the dark side that's well worth taking. No matter what you believe in ... say your prayers.",

            "content": "Before reading this review, I want you to consider this; when I first saw the trailer for \"The Devil Inside\" back in late 2011, I REALLY wanted to see this movie BAD. Regardless of the movie's quality, \"The Devil Inside\" had one of the best, scariest and, in hindsight, most deceptive trailers I had ever seen. Before the movie was even released I was already ready to call this movie one of the scariest films of all time. Even after reviews came in flat-out destroying the movie, I still had faith that when I saw this film, I was in for a flat out roller coaster ride of screams and horror. Eventually, \"The Devil Inside\" was released On Demand, and as soon as it was available, I rented it and prepared myself for a lifetime of scares...That never came.This movie had about as much realism and authenticity as an episode of Parental Control, and unfortunately NONE of the laughs. The dialogue is so awful and corny that it wouldn't even pass in a Z-Grade slasher film. On top of that, unlike in GOOD found footage horror movies where almost all of the footage is used as build up, character scenes or scenes to advance the story, \"The Devil Inside\" features countless scenes of pointless, boring footage thrown in for absolutely no reason other than to help the film reach feature length.If you hadn't guessed by my introductory paragraph, the scares in this movie are SOME OF THE WORST I'VE EVER F***ING EXPERIENCED! This movie is NEVER scary, and it often reaches the very bottom of the barrel for scares. From the contortionist demonically possessed scare (That never worked but for some reason bad horror movies keep using over and over because they think it's scary), to the random nursery rhyme rehearsal scare that comes right the Hell out of nowhere with hardly any connection to anything, to...A dog barking. Yes, \"The Devil Inside\" is so desperate that it has to use a dog barking as a jump scare. Oh yeah, and you know that poster/video clip of the old nun with the glazed over eyes that was marketed EVERYWHERE when this movie came out? Guess what? That scene is in the movie alright, but it's not even intended as a scare. An old woman shows up with glazed over eyes when the crew is running and they cut back to the normal footage like nothing happened. No connection to the plot, no build up, this image was merely thrown in to trick people into going to see a terrible horror movie. Pathetic.The characters range from forgettable to downright detestable, particularly the protagonist Isabella. Isabella Rossi (Fernanda Andrade) is annoying, selfish, foolish and obnoxious from beginning to end. I have never cheered for a main character in a horror movie to die more than I have for this one.The acting is the worst I have seen in a theatrical movie EVER. Fernanda Andrade gives the most unemotive, wooden, painful performance I've seen in my life. Truth be told, she is honestly worse here than Tommy Wiseau in The Room; at least Wiseau made me laugh instead of want to stab my eyes out with scissors. Simon Quarterman is almost as bad as Andrade, underacting to Middle School Play levels and helping to make the entire viewing experience torture. Suzan Crowley, most likely fully aware of just how bad this film's dialogue is, overacts to hilarious levels, not once seeming possessed, scary or real.Believe it or not though, I STILL haven't gone over the worst part of the movie yet! It's not the lack of realism. It's not the awful characters. It's not the horrendous acting. It's not even the lack of scares. It's the fact that there...Is...No...PLOT! I am dead serious, that's not just an accusation I fling around lightly! It's just following Isabella and Exorcist Inc. around doing random exorcisms, neverending babble about \"multiple demonic possession\", a priest kills himself after being possessed, Isabella gets possessed and confusingly gets the whole team killed in a car crash, and the movie tells us to go to some crappy website for \"more information on the ongoing investigation.\" If you go to that website, you're stupid. What do you want me to say? Seeing the audience reaction trailer to this travesty honestly makes me want to cry. I hope that all of the people who pretended to be scared of this garbage were paid well for causing so many people, including me, unbearable, excruciating pain. I can only hope it doesn't weigh too heavily on their conscience. I also hope that William Brent Bell gets officially kicked out of the filmmaking business for flat out lying to audiences about this monstrosity of a \"horror movie\", because I am downright positive I am never gonna see a theatrically released movie as bad as this one as long as I live.",

            "content": "20 years ago, young Isabella Rossi's mother killed two priests and a nun while she was being exorcised: she was subsequently shut away in a mental hospital near the Vatican. Now, in an effort to make sense of this episode, Isabella travels to Rome to visit her, accompanied by filmmaker Michael who looks to make a documentary about the case. After a traumatic first meeting with her mother, Isabella is persuaded to throw in her lot with two young renegade priests who perform exorcisms in cases where the Church has turned its back.So what we have here is (another) exorcism movie, in the format of (another) gonzo camera footage compilation. And, to that extent, there is very little here which isn't utterly predictable. Which is not to say it's bad, it is simply exactly what you are expecting.There are several very good performances in this. Suzan Crowley is genuinely unnerving as mother Maria, Bonnie Morgan impresses as victim Rosa, Evan Helmuth convinces as conflicted priest Father David, and Fernanda Andrade as troubled protagonist Isabella is touching and cute.Also, the effects do a good job of convincing.Less pleasingly, the film conveys demonic possession as a bit like flu, in that if you spend too long in the company of someone who's got it, you may well catch it yourself. And the ending is, quite simply, not good enough. And do I need to mention how overdone the \"found footage\" thing has become?",

            "content": "'THE DEVIL INSIDE': Three Stars (Out of Five) Hugely successful (financially) low budget horror film about a young woman in Italy investigating what happened to her mother when she brutally murdered three people during her exorcism ten years earlier. The film was directed by William Brent Bell and written by Matthew Peterman (the same team that did the 2006 B horror film 'STAY ALIVE'). The movie stars a cast of unknowns including Fernanda Andrade, Simon Quarterman, Evan Helmuth, Ionut Grama and Suzan Crowley (who is outstanding in the film). The film has some classic frightening moments and images and is almost so bad it's good but it's mostly just bad.The film is another 'found footage' fake documentary-style horror film. It begins in 1989 when Maria Rossi (Crowley) murders three people attempting to perform an exorcism on her. She's placed in a Catholic psychiatric hospital in Rome. The movie then flashes forward twenty years when Maria's daughter Isabella (Andrade) is making a documentary on exorcisms and what happened to her mother. She travels to Rome and enlists the help of two rogue priests (Quarterman and Helmuth) on her mission to discover the truth.The movie cost $1 million to make and has made over $101 million in theaters alone. It had a huge opening weekend though and then dropped off severely as bad word of mouth spread. Audiences and film fans alike have widely hated the movie. Which goes to show marketing is everything to a film's success. That's why the film is one of the most profitable film successes of all time and 'JOHN CARTER' is one of the least profitable. Despite it mostly being bad I have to give 'THE DEVIL INSIDE' some credit. It does have some truly memorable and horrifying imagery (that's why it did so well) and B horror films like this are supposed to be bad!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OntHz3aWug",

            "content": "I still do not quite have the words to express my disappointment after watching The Devil Inside a few days ago. I caught it by chance at a free screening before the reviews, the tweets and the unbelievable box office score came in, and did not expect much from it. But sadly, even with very little expectations, the film just may be one of the worst and most inexcusable films I have seen in years.Chances are by now you have seen or heard some form of a creepy ad for The Devil Inside, which follows Isabella (Fernanda Andrade) to Italy to investigate whether or not her mother Maria (Suzan Crowley) is possessed by a demon, and is in need of an exorcism.What the ads do not suggest is how agonizing this trip to Italy really is. For nearly half of its running time, the film is basically a faux documentary about a group of characters that are neither compelling nor interesting. Considering the film follows the set-up of Paranormal Activity right down to the title cards announcing what day it is, you would have figured they would have at least given the audience one character to care about. Instead we have four who are given one- dimensional descriptions and mere hints of past indiscretions. These hints come fast and furious, to the point where they bash the audience into submission \u2013 except they do absolutely nothing for their characters. They mention them in passing, the \"demons\" bring them up, but no one seems to care or want to investigate further. These hints quite simply linger, and never come to any form of fruition. The scenes involving exorcisms or what happens as a result of these \"exorcisms\" prove to be where the only worthwhile part of The Devil Inside lies. They are not all that scary, and the filmmakers seem to be cribbing from both old (The Exorcist) and the new (The Last Exorcism), but the hand-held look of the film makes these scenes somewhat riveting. It gets crazy, and the down and gritty look of the film gives it an aura of realism that keeps your eyes glued to the screen to find out what happens next. While some scenes seem to have been added simply for shock value, including a baptism scene that is nowhere near as intense and ludicrous as trailers and word of mouth have suggested, it does feel like the filmmakers really wanted to try and attempt to elicit some form of reaction or talking point for the film. But this all comes to a screeching halt with the film's ending. After building the audience up to some sort of climax, the film quite simply ends and inexplicably cuts to black. But not before telling the audience to go to a website to learn more about the characters in this supposed \"true story\". No resolution, no obnoxious set-up for a sequel or franchise, not even an indication of what happens next. Instead, just a website followed by the slowest credits ever put to celluloid. I do not think you could even begin to imagine the groaning, the sighs, and the profanity-laced reactions this ending received \u2013 and for good reason. I cannot even begin to imagine what any of the filmmakers were thinking by ending it here. Had they run out of ideas and were simply hoping some sort of viral marketing would keep the project a float? Do they really expect audiences to rush out to learn more on a website, after being cheated out of the cash to wash this insipid filth posing as a real film?So my immediate question, and one I have been trying to answer for days, is what was the whole point of this film? Did Paramount want a new, cheap horror franchise to replacing the waning Paranormal brand? Did marketers want to prove marketing works, even for the worst most dreadful pictures? Did some exec just want a quick and easy paycheque?So many questions, but so very little answers; surprisingly, much like the events, ideas and characterizations in the film itself. In an odd way, it is almost like the film was a meta experiment, designed to see if the audience would eat it up so quickly and easily without question. What I am left with is this: The Devil Inside is a film that exhibited a limited amount of promise with its atypically creepy and borderline sadistic trailer. The final cohesive product however, was a mess of ideas stolen from better films, original ideas that go absolutely nowhere with a handful of riveting hand-held scenes. Nothing more, and nothing less. I cannot in good conscience recommend the film to anyone, even those who like bad movies. No amount of build-up or hype can prepare you for the disappointment you would have in store putting yourself through this atrocious film. I have described the ending to groups of people, and no one can quite believe just how absolutely awful it really is. I cannot remember the last time I absolutely loathed a film mere seconds after watching it, but The Devil Inside may take that record. I just really hope this cruel joke of a film is not a true indication of what we have in store for 2012. Because between that and remembering this movie even exists, we may be in for one bad year at the movies.3/10.",

I knew exactly how it would end by the first clip of the film. I think that they gave the slower following members of the audience to many little slight suggestions as to where they were going that, for the average genre fan, it was to blatant and undermined anything they tried to accomplish. The fact that the main subject in the \"Exorcism Seminar\" was about multiple possession and transfer, and the danger to priest... come on now... a chimp could but that ending together. Then you think, \"why watch the rest?\" The answer is simple, I want to seem some really freaky scenes that will haunt me forever! Sorry, not that either. I can honestly say that I have seen dancers on televised talent shows performing dance routines with the same moves. The story got to the point to where is was so lacking that they instituted startle tactics.

            "content": "In Italy, a woman becomes involved in a series of unauthorised exorcisms during her mission to discover what happened to her mother, who allegedly murdered three people during her own exorcism.The Devil Inside was made on a $1 million budget and went on to score a huge box office return. A few films over the years have opened on similar micro-budgets and gone on to make massive profits whilst being at the very least good films. For example, The Blair Witch Project, Saw, Insidious \u2013 all made for similar amounts and all very highly rated by critics and fans within the genre. The Devil Inside however doesn't deserve to be in such company. I tried to look past the fact that the found footage and exorcism films seem to have been done to death in recent years, and give the film the chance to try stand out on its own. Well, it does stand out but unfortunately not for very good reasons.The film follows a young woman named Isabella Rossi on a quest to Rome to try and find some answers about her mothers possible demonic possession. Her mother Maria Rossi committed a triple murder during an exorcism performed on her twenty years earlier. The Catholic Church became involved, and she has since been in a Catholic psychiatric hospital in Rome. Once Isabella arrives in Rome she follows two priests working outside of the Church who perform a series of exorcisms.It just felt like everything the film did has been done a thousand times before and much better. It offered nothing new, just the standard demonic possessions with some strange contortions and bone braking noises thrown in for some cheap scare moments. The film isn't overly graphic, and in my opinion the best parts of the film are when the director actually shows some action whether it be during an exorcism or the standoff towards the end of the film.The acting is average at best, there are no recognisable stars hence the budget, but this doesn't always equal a bad film, some of the best films contain no recognisable stars, but nothing acting wise could save this film sadly. I think there were a few good ideas but they were just poorly executed. And the ending\u0085\u0085..its literally as though the director ran out of time and didn't bother with one. My guess is due to the massive financial success of this film we will get a sequel. Whether that answers any questions on this film remains to be seen. I'll be happy if they just make a better all round film and try and find something new rather than re-hash bits from every previous exorcism film.The acting is average at best, there are no recognisable stars hence the budget, but this doesn't always equal a bad film, some of the best films contain no recognisable stars, but nothing acting wise could save this film sadly.

There, they meet the Devilbusters: rouge priests who do exorcisms on their own without the consent of the Church. Oooohhh.Oh, and they don't wanna be caught, so naturally, they allow their Exo-cave of high-tech Devilbustin' equipment be filmed. Huh?Anyways, if that part doesn't start the slide into utter movie-madness, then just wait. There's more for you to laugh at. Like how close, for no reason whatsoever, the subjects like to be at the camera. I literally kept pushing my hands in the air to get them back. (Remember the speech given by Heather in The Blair Witch Project, spoofed in Scary Movie? Imagine it closer.)While it's not the worst movie I've seen, but since it's the first (and only) 2012 release I've seen, it does constitute as the #1 worst of 2012.

Here's looking at you, The Devil Inside, a complete abomination and nothing short of a poor excuse of a movie. It makes me sad to see even a minority of good reviews for it, because it seems to indicate that mediocrity is the new good. If this is not bad, sweet Moses, what is?The concept and the plot is a rehash of a rehash of a rehash. It's a found footage film - because that's original! - which begins as a mockumentary about a girl whose mother once killed three people during an exorcism, and ended up in a mental hospital in Rome. Now she wants to \"understand what happened\" - why bother making it more complicated than that, huh? - so she goes to see her mother who seems to be taken out of a Monty Python skit, banging her head against the walls of her institutional room as if this would be scary and not a piece of absurdist humor.The Vatican has apparently seminars on exorcism and demons to young priests (?!) and on one of these she meets two guys moonlighting exorcisms, that is exorcisms without Church approval. Are they gonna get the demon out of her mother? Might it escape her body and possess one of the others? Will the film end, just like that? Should all the plot threads turn out to only have been the result of amateurish negligence? Should everything be unintentionally comical? Will anything work at all?The big problem is the use of the found footage concept. I'm a big fan of this sub genre and the point of these films is that they are authentic, credible, that the audience at some level manages to be convinced that the material is genuine. As soon as we get a reason to fall outside of the film, and watch it as mere fiction, the movie is done for. Many found footage films fail because of the discipline it actually takes from the film makers to make a successful found footage film. But The Devil Inside is on a whole other level of bad.Had the script been the basis for a standard horror movie it would have been like a worse Exorcism Of Emily Rose or any other exorcist film. It had not been good, because the movie lacks any overall quality: the plot is one hundred percent formula, the dialogs are all with no exceptions clich\u00e9s that are so tired they become nonsensical and void of all believability, and the movie scandalously ignores any kinds of realism and reality. All that said, had it been a \"straight\" movie it still wouldn't have been such a howler as this one is.Sure, already in The Exorcist (in 1971, mind you!) we found out that the Church practically don't perform exorcisms any longer, so the idea that the clergy in Rome are given instructions in the subject in 2012 is shockingly stupid. But in a normal movie, you could have said: Yes, but what about the cinematography? How is it directed?One can not do such things with The Devil Inside, and that's exactly why it has been made. It seems as if the found footage-trend has given \"filmmakers\" the idea that you don't have to make any effort in anything to make a buck on a movie. This movie lacks any sign of ambition or talent, any meaning or logic, any motivation for even having been made. The girl in the movie wants to meet her mother. Why is that? She has a demon in her. Why? She meets two would be-exorcists? Yeah? Why is this interesting and exciting? It's not original, so where's the other twist? Directing-wise this movie is worthless, and the acting is absolutely abysmal, taken straight from Overacting 101 for Amateurs. In the very first scene when the girl in the lead role sits and talks about her childhood, we understand that we are watching an amateur actress who pretends that she is part of a documentary. It is not directed in a way to suggest authenicism, it looks more like a cheap American TV- commercial for condoms. After those fateful first seconds - seconds! - of the film it proceeds to one meaningless clich\u00e9 after another that throws up loose ends everywhere. I won't even go into the ending. I do not know how they were thinking when they made this movie, but every little effort - like a story, motivating a plot, ending included - seems to have been too much for everyone involved. Or is it so that those who made this movie is just a bunch of drones who discovered that they can cash in by going to Rome with a DV camera and film some stuff. If so, then this movie a little black Armageddon-cloud in the sky of movies. We finally hit the absolute rock bottom in creativity.The few positive reviews of this movie are unfortunate. Even if you can see beyond the found footage-format - which the film butchers, thereby rendering it meaningless - and perhaps see one or two qualities in one or two tired and old and unconvincing effects, I feel these reviews are still written by people who are way too content with very, very little. This movie is an essential zero star movie. It is a film no one should have to pay to see - and anyone who checks it out should only do so in interest of seeing one of the worst and most worthless things ever produced as an excuse for a film. That should not be misunderstood as a compliment, or a recommendation.",

            "content": "Simply put \"The Devil Inside\" could be described as \"The Blair Witch Project\" meets \"The Exorcist\". It's also quite similar to \"The Last Exorcism\" which I previously reviewed. \"The Devil Inside\" was in theaters at the beginning of the year and took in a pretty impressive $33 million its first weekend.The movie opens with a 911 call and a woman saying she has killed three people. This is Maria Rossi and the main question about her and about possession cases in general is that is she really possessed? or just mentally ill? Maria is taken into custody and is eventually sent to a mental hospital in Rome. We then pick up the story of her daughter Isabella, played by Fernanda Andrade, who has teamed up a documentary film crew as she is about to visit her mother for the first time. Luckily Isabella and the whole cast for that matter are all attractive and easy to look at (since this is a \"real\" documentary and all). It's also a great coincidence that everybody in Italy speaks English and is easy to talk to (just sayin'). Isabella does visit the very real Exorcism School at the Vatican and meet up with a few young priests who help them along the way. Also the idea of multiple possessions and of demonic transference is brought up and plays a part later on.All minor annoyances aside this really is a pretty frightening movie. The acting is pretty incredible, starting with Maria (Suzan Crowley) whose plays crazy and possessed like she is actually crazy and possessed. Rosa (contortionist Bonnie Morgan) has short scene that is the stuff of nightmares, but with a dash of humanity. Despite what she has been through in her life Isabella is pretty well adjusted and lives a normal life.Isabella and the group perform a sort of unsanctioned exorcism on Maria at the mental hospital and things get pretty intense. Something happens that makes this exorcism movie unique. I won't spoil it but it makes for a interesting third act. Personally I think the ending is pretty awesome, but a lot of people hate it. Since this is a found footage type movie you'd expect this type of ending. Its abrupt, ambiguous are leaves a lot of questions. What happened next? More than likely with the amount of money it took in a sequel can't be far behind. \"The Devil Inside\" is now available on DVD, Blu-Ray and digital download so give it a shot.\"The Devil Inside\" Needs to be Unleashed.",

            "content": "\"The Devil Inside\" is a fairly average movie in this particular genre. It doesn't really offer anything new to the genre, nor does it provide anything that will dazzle and blow you away.Shot as a pseudo-documentary, the camera work in the movie is questionable, and shaky at times. When I sit down to watch a movie I want proper and professional camera work. If I want shaky camera work and a documentary-feel to what I am watching I will go to the various TV channels such as Animal Planet, National Geographic, and the likes.The storyline progress at a fairly good pace, and it does build up a fair sense of suspense and thrill. The movie does keep you glued to the screen and leaves you wanting to see more and see what happens next. The story is also helped along nicely by the effects and the characters.The effects in the movie worked out well, despite not being million dollar budget Hollywood CGI effects with glamor and dazzling mesmerizing effect. Hats off to the special effects team in this movie, because they made it believable and realistic, while keeping it at a minimalistic level.However, what made this a mediocre experience for me was the camera work and the 'documentary-like' feeling there was to the movie. Plus, the ending was rather corny and cheesy. There are better possession movies out there, but \"The Devil Inside\" is still well worth a watch.",

            "content": "Before I start off I'll say this: from the beginning of the movie to just before the ending, the movie is not painful or unbearable to watch, but it's not exactly exciting or good either. So why give this a one? Well that's simple, because the ending is so bad that whatever thing or two I liked were completely obliterated from my mind. I'll get to the ending in greater detail later, lets just talk about everything before the ending first.The movie starts off with the police getting a call from a woman saying she murdered three people. Police go and investigate, find her and then the movie jumps ahead to our time. Then the movie goes a little something like this, daughter of the woman who murdered those people finds out about her mom, goes to mom sees she's possessed, finds priests, performs unauthorized exorcisms, then things start to go bad for everyone, then the end. Sound familiar? Good, because it's the same dam thing as every other possession movie with the paranormal activity mockumentary style thrown it to make it seem \"different\".The acting in this movie isn't laughable, but no one seems capable of emitting any sort of emotion. You won't be seeing any of these stars anytime soon. However, I will give credit to the woman who plays Maria Rossi(Susan Crowley). She was very convincing as someone who was possessed but, the way her scenes are filmed are more likely to provoke laughter than terror.Next are the characters, ha characters. They're all cardboard cut-outs and I didn't care about any of them. The scares are predictable and you can see them coming a mile away(for example, after one of the exorcisms that went horribly wrong a priest is baptizing a baby. Towards the end where he has to quickly dunk the baby in the holy water, you can already tell that he's going to try to drown the baby, it was so obvious). The only actual creepy part or two are in the condensed, more enjoyable, and less time consuming two minute trailer. Other than those two creepy moments there was nothing scary about this movie, the trailer for the oogieloves frightened me more than this entire movie.Now to the best part, the ending. This has to be one of the worst endings I have ever seen. Did the film makers run out of money? Or did they run out of ideas so that they said to themselves, \"eh, this is good enough let's just end it\"?? Whatever the reason is, by the time those end credits started rolling, I realized how much of an idiot I was for wasting my time. I won't give away the ending but, it ends right in the middle of the climax, who in their right mind would think that's a good idea. Were they trying to leave us with a cliffhanger? Do they know what a cliffhanger is? 83 minutes of my life wasted on this garbage, and that's with credits. People will still probably watch this due to sheer curiosity, but seriously, don't even bother. The ending is so abrupt and leaves so many things unresolved that it makes this whole movie just a complete waste of time. The best parts are in the trailer so just watch the trailer again instead of subjecting yourself to this and wasting 83 minutes of your life. Sometimes videos waiting to be found, should just be left alone.",

I didn't think this film would be too bad and I was wrong. The problem is that the film is boring and not very scary, at least to me. Now I'm one of those people who love the Paranormal Activity films but, for me, those films got it right because it created suspense even if it was false ones. You expect something to jump out at you and goshdarnit those films were fun to watch. This one, on the other hand, was just plain boring. It acts as a documentary on a fake story they created, and pretends as if the events was recorded on the spot. I usually like these kind of things but here, I just felt there was no real establishment of the characters. I never felt like I knew them enough to care about them. I guess there's that Angelina Jolie lookalike daughter but she just wasn't developed enough for me other than she had an abortion and she's the daughter of some devil mom.The worst offender was the ending. First off, there's a built momentum after the first hour and it piqued my interest but then, all of a sudden, it was over. Me and the rest of the audience was like, \"That can't be the ending. No way.\" And it was. My personal belief is that if you don't have a good ending, it could put a serious negative effect on your movie. This applies here.The Devil Within isn't the worst movie I've seen but it will contribute to a lot of people's distaste for the found footage films. If many people are sick of found footage films, this film may be at the top of their list as of why.But my friend liked the film.",

This is true in many genres but usually there's some sort of twist on plot or other angle you can take, however 'The Devil Inside' focuses purely on Exorcism and in my opinion just doesn't cut it for me.Found footage films are always up against it, as stated in other reviews they really are love or hate, the main problem being is what you are going to show in the actual footage has to be pretty damn powerful to hold any kind of weight and I just felt this let me down....Overall 'The Devil Inside' I cannot recommend. I've been lucky when it has come to horror at the cinema of late, \"Insidious\" and \"The Woman in Black\" being stand outs and I was hoping to carry on my run. I left the cinema fairly disappointed and wished that it could have been better. However the boring script and dialog coupled with the lack of scares really hindered the efforts of this film. If you're after a solid 'Exorcist' style film watch the daddy itself or \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\", they deliver something which this doesn't, quality.Read the full review at: beyondthegore",

            "content": "This movie was worse than expected. Of course my expectations for it weren't very high to begin with but the movie made some incredibly bad choices, which made the movie even worse to watch than anticipated.Of course the movie is not being very original. There are countless of exorcism movies out there already but quite frankly I don't mind that all that much. After all, when a movie is done good and original, the concept can still work out. But this movie wasn't even really trying all that hard, it seemed.Basically this movie is adding nothing new to the genre and it only tries to be somewhat original by taking a documentary like approach to its subject (even though this also already has been done a couple of times already). But problem with this approach is; it only works out if the entire movie is being a realistic one. And this movie never is. It never makes you even remotely think you are watching a real documentary here, simply because the acting is far too bad and also the way the camera is being handled or positioned makes this a far from convincing mockumentary. Thing that also annoyed me (besides the shaking cam) was that the movie kept switching back and forth between different camera-positions. Don't do this if you want to be taken serious as a 'real' documentary.Besides, there also isn't anything real good or interesting happening in this movie to hold your interest. This was obviously a very cheap movie to make, which also unfortunately meant they couldn't put anything really exciting in the movie and the film-makers themselves were lacking in true creativity to come up with something interesting and to let its low budget work for its own advantage.But seriously, I could had still handled the movie if it was entirely like this. However toward its end, it's starting to take a turn for the worst. Suddenly, for no real apparent reason, the crew members started to become characters in the movie and the movie starts to become more and more unlikely with all of its events. And the ending...well, I wouldn't even call it an ending. It's just a cheap and incredible lazy way to end your movie.The story isn't going anywhere, no tense or creepy horror atmosphere, horrible acting, a silly and cheap documentary approach that doesn't work out convincing, an horrible ending.

One of the more interesting elements here is the usual fare associated with these types of films in that the central premise is rather enjoyable. This main setup, about a woman who goes around looking for answers to a long-held question about an incident in her past, makes this one go off on a strong start featuring the girl going through the trip to the church where she runs into the priests for the remainder of the film. That manages to introduce all the fun in the second half where it goes nicely into the different effects of how they go about their routine within the church, as the viewpoint of them taking classes to learn more about the differences between the different states of being required for them to initiate an exorcism. This goes into them not only on their first exorcism trip with the crew to watch them conduct it that has a lot to like with their really enjoyable sequence inside the basement of the home where the sequence takes place and how that leads into starting in on her mothers' case at her insistence. That provides some of the best material in the film where their attempted exorcism of the mother is exceptionally chilling and has some solid action with the continuous missteps they take involving her getting the upper hand on the situation by throwing everyone around the room or providing overt supernatural action that's incredibly fun to watch. As the finale works in some rather impressive scenes here showing far more normal possession aspects especially at the hospital finale, there's quite a lot to like with this one. That said, there are still some big problems with this one. The biggest issue here is the film's insistence on filming this as a faux documentary when it didn't need to be. The idea of here following the two guys around and showing how the different treatments they provide work on their patients serves this well enough but the format of doing so as a found-footage/faux-documentary style devalues the impact of these scenes. That these scenes are done through multiple cameras anyway manages to make that factor even more prominent which is what makes for quite a disappointing feature with an underwhelming main aspect of the film. As well, with this being so heavily dependent on the exorcisms the film can feel exceptionally bland for long periods, really lowering this one significantly.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",

This was surely one of the most hyped underground flicks that also earned a lot of money, I thought it received 13 times the cost it was made. But still, the hype was in the States and I don't want to offend anybody but there are already a few flicks that are hyped over there that people in other countries found stupid or even laughable. The Blair Witch Project (1999) must have been one of those most hyped mockumentaries that have circled around. But that one surely had it's moments. If you want it gorier then you should watch Cannibal Holocaust (1980). But we are stuck here with The Devil Inside.Again, with such a title and concerning exorcism you have to fight against the atrocities from The Exorcist (1973). So far I haven't seen such a flick with such an impact. The Devil Inside won't be on that list.What is the problem is the acting. The priests just didn't look believable. The possessed ones were okay and I admit, if you haven't seen Splinter (2008) then you will get goosebumps by the way a possessed body (Rosa) could be deformed and still being alive. It do looks creepy the way Rosa (Bonnie Morgan)is laying on the table. Naturally with those kind of flicks the beginning is rather dull and it takes a while before things started (look at Paranormal Activity trilogy) but here it takes a bit too long. It never becomes really creepy or scary, we all have seen the swearing and dirty words involving sex and the white eyes. It's maybe towards the final that things go awry. The suicide will have it's effects to viewers with a weak stomach but for horror geeks it's a bit too late. And as so many said, the way it ended is rather a big mistake. You don't stop a flick with referring to a website. Fernanda Andrade who plays Isabella Rossi will be the only name for a few to remember and more towards her beauty than the flick itself. Stay Alive (2006) was the director William Brent Bell attempt to pick in on the torture porn style Saw. Here he tried to pick in on the success of Paranormal Activity. It do has it's moments only most of the thespians weren't possessed with good acting.

            "content": "Honestly, I'm a big fan of horror movies, particularly exorcism films, and saying that 1973's \"The Exorcist\" film was more believable and scary than a film developed (or in this case, just taped together) in the era of technology and special effects, well, like Dora the Explorer would say, no \"bueno.\" By mentioning the original \"The Exorcist\", I am not bashing it, it is one of the best horror films I've ever seen, but I am rather comparing the quality, originality, and production technique to that of a movie made in present-time society.Should I ramble on about how it lacked originality? Though I've already covered it, the extreme levels of unoriginality make me feel the need to make emphasis again - let's face it, exorcism and demonic forces seems to be a pretty hot topic in the 2000-2010 era (\"Paranormal Activity\" movies, \"The Last Exorcism\", \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\", you catch my drill). And I get it, some of those films actually turned out decent, but it was the fact of having a story behind it that made a difference. \"The Devil Inside\" equals no story. Sure sure, they make you think it's a story about uncovering whether Isabella's mom, Maria Rossi, is either suffering from mental illness (disocciative identity disorder) or an actual demonic possession, but OF COURSE, they can't leave the woman alone to the fact that she might just be mentally ill - there really is no story. There are names, there is a place, there is a time, but there's no story - no development, as pretty much all the characters die (...for some reason...), accordingly due to the \"demonic forces\", but really not providing evident proof or at least some downright logic. We don't really learn anything, it's all too blurry like the camera movement of a majority part of the film.So in the intellectual sense, Dora says \"nada\". This film was put together to earn a few bucks and give slight entertainment, if watching a movie going on about something that they don't know that was never figured out yet they pretend they did can be called entertainment. No strong action, no climax, some screams and scenes that made you jump a bit here and there, other than that, just another epic fail movie about exorcism. \"...And they lived happily ever after.\"",

The movies are always goofy, annoying, and could have been made by any 4th grader with their parent's video camera. They take no real skill to execute and I've yet to see a good one. Blair Witch, Paranormal Activity, etc. all bored me to tears and made me wish they'd discover a tripod instead of the cause of all that strange noise late at night.So, right here, you might want to stop reading if you love found footage movies. I know I would. Still, even for a subgenre I detest, The Devil Inside might easily take the cake as the worst one I've seen throughout this whole cycle (which should be due for a vacation any day now).The acting is abysmal, the scares non-existent, the camera-work is appalling, everything just adds up to a horrible experience at the movies. This is bottom of the barrel, Wal-Mart bargain bin material here. How it ever got a theatrical release is beyond me. I don't even think this could scare a 4 year old child. Some of the imagery, when isolated from the context of film, could be considered spooky. Hell, that's why the trailers have been generating buzz. It has more gore and naughty language than most of the other Exorcist rip-offs of recent years, but that doesn't add anything when the script is so dull and unscary to begin with.A waste of time, a waste of money!

            "content": "Whenever I go to see a horror film I do it with caution. It is a genre that I like, I confess, but it has so much garbage that its really difficult to find a movie that is worthwhile. And when the film is shot using the \"found footage\" technique, I fear the worst. In this specific case, all of my fears were well founded.The film, like many others before and after, focuses on Catholic exorcism and does so, like many other films, in a way that borders the absurd. Without wanting to pull out of gallons that I feel I neither possess nor deserve, let me clarify that I am a Catholic, I go to mass, I even know many priests, deacons and some bishops, so I have a good knowledge about the Church. So I can say that whoever has the minimum knowledge of Catholic rituals knows very well that everything this film shows is **** and worse, **** copied from the famous film \"The Exorcist\". Even some of the priests lines are identical! The difference is that \"The Exorcist\" pays off in other aspects, such as the quality and commitment of everyone involved, the intensity of the scenes, etc. It is a magnificent film and it gives us what this film cannot give: tension, suspense, fear.What is Catholic exorcism? The film takes the subject but does not develop it. Allow me to clarify: exorcism is a sacramental that has to be authorized by a bishop and done by a properly qualified priest, but that is only used as a last resort and when there is medical and psychiatric support, that is, when medicine and psychiatry feel that they can no longer help. You cannot do an exorcism without permission or without the presence of able people, including a doctor, and in fact there is no filming. The film mentions this, and does it well, but then it puts priests in blatant disobedience. I do not know if it would be the case for an excommunication, as one of the characters says, but I am sure that these priests would have been immediately suspended and could even be forbidden from practising priestly duties. Therefore, everything we see in this film is an excuse for a carnival that the film calls exorcism. The story itself and the construction of the characters is highly deficient.The cast doesn't help, but I don't blame the actors. The failure of the film comes, clearly, from a bad script and the bad material given to the cast. Suzan Crowley was the best actress here, with a convincing performance of madness that really works well. The Brazilian Fernanda Andrade can join the list of Brazilian actors who made the leap to the USA but was not particularly happy in this film. Simon Quarterman and Evan Helmuth were mediocre.At a technical level, the film is globally bad. The best was the performance of the stunts, generally anonymous, who brought to life the contortionism and the most violent scenes. It takes elasticity to achieve those, and people who did it here deserve applause. For the rest, we can point out the bad cinematography, in the worst \"found footage\" style, that do not even know how to take advantage of the beauty of the city of Rome. The sets and costumes are monotonous and the soundtrack is not even worth mentioning.",

Yes they're horror movies but to compare a contemporary slasher film (and there are many brilliant ones) such as Halloween to say The Exorcist it almost seems improper; they are both superb and they are both horror but The Exorcist delves deep down into the psyche. It sets up an almost impossible means of escape from evil. You're basically helpless against the supernatural. If given the right treatment an exorcism type film can be a vicious and riveting powerhouse. A legitimately terrifying experience. The Exorcism Of Emily Rose I thought was outstanding. Even the first Paranormal Activity delivered a sense of quiet and creepy chills. Then again if it's not properly treated the final impact can make you feel cheated.I just seen The Devil Inside last night. This film had the potential to be one heck of a ride. Unfortunately it isn't. I have nothing against \"real footage\" movies, a Director's vision of a film as far as I'm concerned is his or her own choice. I've seen plenty of this style of movie making and some truly blew me away, although I don't see why it is so difficult to hold the camera steady. The acting was just o.k. Every single character explaining their issues directly to the camera is plain silly. The main character in the film is the young girl's mother locked up in an asylum who, even though is clearly brutally violent, is allowed to be visited by her daughter in her room alone?! The young girl sits in on a real exorcism given to a different person who is kept locked in a basement in her house?! One of the priests attempts to kill a baby in a church because he is possessed and just walks out and goes home?! Acts of multiple possession ensues everyone. The ending is corny.This particular exorcism film will have you rolling your eyes.The girl in the basement looked like she was from a human pretzel circus act. The girl's mother yelling and throwing people was quite funny. The baby killing priest was in bad taste and him just walking out of the church....whatever. The ending obviously pointed towards the Director saying, \"What the hell......it's a wrap......everyone go home.\"To say it kindly, if you're a fan of this genre then do not put your faith in this one.",

            "content": "This US box office surprise has been advertised as \"the film the Vatican doesn't want you to see\", not because it unveils a scandal in the Catholic Church but because even they know it's a poor movie. It is saddening as the topic of exorcism is so interesting and has succeeded in earlier films, but The Devil Inside does not know what it's doing with its pace or characters or fearfulness or anything.Believe the negative comments you're hearing from the US. The story is of Isabella Rossi (Fernanda Andrade) and her cameraman/boyfriend Michael (Ionut Grama) who want to learn about exorcism in the Catholic Church and see if it can help Isabella's mother, who killed three people during an exorcism in 1989. Two fairly well-acted priests, Benjamin and David (Quarterman and Helmuth respectively), are willing to educate them about \"the combination of science and religion\", and allow them to film everything ever. Despite the running time of 95 minutes and the abrupt ending, it felt like it went on too long. About 40 minutes in my friend said to me, \"Nothing has happened yet.\" If the first 45 minutes were condensed into 20, there would be enough action.Perhaps this film will kill the fake-documentary, shaky-cam style that recently worked so well in Chronicle. Much of the 'found footage' was trivial shots that you wouldn't shoot and would have made sense if done professionally. Even worse were the shots that would be important enough to shoot, but the camera is unnecessarily mobile. Get a goddamn tripod! Stop zooming in! If this was meant to have suspension of disbelief, it didn't work. The shots that have no reason to be filmed included the fleeting moment involving the nun with pupil-less eyes. This image has been used on many posters, meaning a lot of the audience probably went to see it on the back of the poster. Understandable as it's a cool poster, but when the moment comes around it's forgettable and not a part of the story. Perhaps more irritating than shots that you would not shoot are the shots that are impossible to shoot. When Isabella meets the hilarious Maria in a mental hospital she appears to be seeing her alone. Yet, you see hand-held camera crap from at least three different angles. It's as if Michael is not only in the room, but he's in the room three times. Perhaps this is fussy, but I would say confidently that you don't need to be watching critically to notice this.This is not the new Paranormal Activity. Whilst I'm not mad about that series, they manage to sustain fear until the end, especially the first PA. The Devil Inside scares you in jolts and then shuts up for a while. It has to be said, I jumped every time I was supposed to and a few that I wasn't. The scene with the exorcism of Rosa - played by the brilliant contortionist Bonnie Morgan - genuinely scared me, but so did a dog that barked at Isabella in another scene. A minor problem with Rosa's scene was the creepy, grimy basement it took place in. If you're doing something frightening like an exorcism, do it in a well-lit, comfortable environment. Maybe all the scenes should be exciting or an important part of the narrative, instead of only being exciting on special occasions. Maybe all the nearly-good scenes shouldn't be juxtaposed with goings-on in the priests' house. Most of all, maybe Father Benjamin should throw out that lamp that hurt my eyes every time it was on-screen. The division into sections by telling us the date with white text on a blank screen became boring after about the sixth time too.Not much to critique about the soundtrack. Music was very minimal - a smart choice to match the found-footage idea and make things vaguely believable. The slightly exaggerated ambiance was useful too. In the opening where a couple of investigators are looking around the bloodied basement there's some silly, eerie, music that we could do without.The main issue I was hearing on the IMDb forums was that the ending is awful, lazy, doesn't make sense etc., but considering it made $33 million in its opening weekend, I speculated that it was being shown in multiplexes to audiences mainly used to a tight Hollywood ending. Not the case. It doesn't leave you asking yourself the question that Isabella asked early on: \"I want to find out what happened.\" Instead you ask, not for the first time: why on earth did that happen? It is a rushed, not emotive, disappointing ending. Usually when you see a scene that you don't like, you can accept that there are differing tastes or specific audiences that will 'get it'. I was left asking, why did anyone think this was good? All that said, it did provoke a reaction from me. It provoked me to shout \"f*** off!\" at the screen.

This film follows Isabella Rossi (Fernanda Andrade) as she investigates how to help her mother Maria (Suzan Crowley), who had been locked in a mental institution in Italy after she killed three religious personnel who were apparently in the process of exorcising her. The first 30 minutes or so were spent as a rather pedantic discussion about exorcism. When the investigator goes with a young exorcist Fr. Ben (Simon Quarterman) to an actual exorcism, that is when the film becomes interesting. The team encounters Maria only by the first hour already. The last 15 minutes were an unexpectedly bizarre turn of events which unfortunately end as soon as they were built up. I don't know how to rate this film. Maybe there is only so much that can be done about exorcism in film, and there had certainly been so many already, almost every year. \"The Devil Inside\" at least tries to be different with a serious documentary approach to the events.

            "content": "Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole Ashland Who is William Brent Bell? Could he be the director of the new low budget exorcism movie \"The Devil Inside\"? Could he be the man to single handedly spell the end for these faux-documentary \"horror\" movies? Could he also be the director of the first bad movie of the year? In the end, WHO CARES who William Brent Bell is! Because whatever far too negative thoughts which come to mind when the term \"director\" and William Brent Bell are used in the same sentence, will soon become as irrelevant as his career is after directing \"The Devil Inside\".Though the trailers promises audiences an entertaining horror movie full of scares and terrifying images, due to a grocery list of outstanding flaws \"The Devil Inside\" is doomed to snatch the title of worst film of 2012 so far (and it's only the second week!). The faults are as follows: Via an awful script, this film attempts to become far deeper than simply a B movie horror flick, by inserting psychological dialogues having to do with mental health disorders as the modern Catholic Church's alternative to possession, which does nothing but slow the film down to a crawl (at times). The script (partially written by Bell himself) also does its part to take away from any scary moments the film would have had. Any time there was a genuine build up to a scare, one of the characters would say something utterly outlandish or begin singing \"The Itsy Bitsy Spider\" and create a state of unintentional goofiness that worked to negate any and all scares. The acting also hinders this movie greatly. The phrase \"can't act his/her way out of a paper bag\" cannot be used enough in this case, but that is to be expected out of a low-budget film of this nature. Furthermore, if there were any dust particles of entertainment value floating aimlessly throughout this film, they were overshadowed by some inexcusably shaky camera-work which was so bad that while watching the film I realized (beyond a shadow of a doubt) that \"The Devil Inside\" stood alone as the worst visual experience I have ever had watching a hand held faux-documentary. The phrase \"Can't direct his way out of a paper bag\" can also be thrown around quite liberally here, as the director of this amateurish endeavor shows his lack of skills early and often. There are some scenes were the camera (mid-sentence) cuts to inconceivable shots of the side of a forehead and others (when cameras are installed in a car) that look as if everybody's mouths and body movements were inexplicably sped up post-production. There is also a directorial ploy used where (from time to time throughout the film) the cameraman pulls priests and other characters of note into \"confessionals\" of sorts where they spout off emotionally driven asides of how they are really scared or how they don't like the other people in the house. Yes, these scenes are all too stupidly reminiscent of similarly shot sequences in MTV shows such as \"The Real World\" or \"Jersey Shore\". But all the bad acting, lazy camera-work, sloppy dialogue and the fact that the first hour of this \"horror film\" contains a debilitatingly slow build up, with little to no actual scares in it, can all be forgiven and considered side effects of hokey B movie productions. BUT, what cannot be forgiven is the slap in the face ending, which consists of a half-way descent climax culminating in basically (SPOILER ALERT) an abrupt ending. And as the groans from the audience commenced as the screen suddenly goes black (an ending that is all too egregiously overused in films like these), a message flashes on the screen ballsy enough to incite a riot. It reads: For more information about this case, go to www.mariarossi.com (or something to that effect). To me this is the equivalent to watching a Discovery Channel show and being told \"for more information on tigers consult your local library\". In short, while it works for said Discovery Channel show, what did I just pay for?! Did I really just pay 10.50 to see a movie that contains, not an actual ending, but a climax which results in a website where I am to continue to seek out an ending that the director refused to show in theaters?! Another way to see this ending could be as Bell letting the audiences know (in so many words) how he already has their money, therefore he can throw any old ending up there and nobody could stop him. To quote the Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons, \"Worst ending ever!\" Final Thought: I am not going to lie. For about fifteen minutes of this 87 minute film (beginning around minute 60) there is a semblance of suspense that, no matter how predictable, was somewhat engaging. BUT the fact that it took so long to get to this point in conjunction with the sad fact of how it ended (my God, don't get me started again on that ending) negates almost any recollection of entertainment value \"The Devil Inside\" had. So obviously my consensus is to skip \"The Devil Inside\", unless you are a fan of sitting through movies where you can barely see anything that is happening on screen; or crappy endings.Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

When people told me this movie would involve exorcisms and Catholic church, I thought they wouldn't be so lazy and would make a new story for this genre-- how naive I am. The first part of the movie is basically the same as \"The Rite\"; a school of priests in Rome and one of the students not believing anything he's been taught. Other than that, the film is a completely rip off of some mainstream movies, such as \"The Exorcist\", \"Paranormal Activity\", \"Exorcism of Emily Rose\", among others. I have to admit some scenes are a little frightening, specially with that woman screaming all of a sudden and making me jump out of the cinema's seat. Also, I can't deny Suzan Crowley is good; that first scene when her daughter went to visit her proves that-- even thought I indeed LAUGHED in that scene because I find crazy people really funny. But the hugest complaint of mine is the disappointing ending, which I believe NOBODY will enjoy! Avoid this film and stuck with the old versions of this saturated subject.",

Am sure it would be more enjoyable if I had never seen an exorcism movie before or had never seen the demon switch bodies format of Fallen etc. The acting however is okay and the only reason I have given it a 4 rather than less. The idea itself is sound although would have been better if it had not been so obvious. The fact that the plot is centred on the fact that the Vatican was able to take an American woman who had committed multiple murder to Italy and commit her there was laughable. Am sure she would be locked up in an American high security mental unit far less able to leave the country. In addition, there is nowhere near enough actual exorcism footage. The protagonists are very easily convinced at the existence of the devil etc. Also the lack of consistency of the characterisation of the practising priest who is doing undercover exorcisms but doesn't let it bother him until this one is ridiculous. And the ending views like a teenage horror story: the writer has no idea how to end it so kills everyone. One step away from 'it was all a dream'. A film for the inexperienced watchers am afraid.",

            "content": "I can't believe this is the movie starting off my new year. Geez, I hope it's not a bad omen of the films to come. Than again it is the craptastic month of January one of the two months of the year(the other being September) where they release their throwaway films. Made for less than a million dollars by a company named Insurge films that I've never heard of \"The Devil Inside\" is a boring, generic rehash of horror clich\u00e9s with a lot of imagination but left effectless by bad performances, confused direction and well tiresome horror clich\u00e9s. The film tells the tale of a young woman who comes to Rome to visit her mother in a mental hospital. After not having seen her the better portion of her life. Because she was committed there after she murdered three people while they were performing an exorcism on her. Of course the daughter arrives with a cameraman to document the experience and she discovers her mother is indeed possessed. With the help of two priests who conduct unapproved exorcisms she is invited to attend exorcisms so that she may better understand her mothers situation. The big problem with this film above all others even though it has many, Is that it's not believable in the least. Their are such huge gaps in the logic of the film that leave you feeling confused. Such as the fact that we are supposed to believe that they would commit her to a mental institution in Rome despite the fact that she lives in America or that anyone would think it would be a good idea for someone to tag along for exorcisms or that any of the characters in this film could gain any type of authority to visit any of these places or conduct any of the situations that appear on film. Most notably the exorcism of her mother in a different hospital room than in which the one she stays, and there are many many more. None of the performances are very effective, the characters are not well drawn, the film making feels shorted, the spfx look cheesy and there are really no scares. All of which is sad because the film has moments where you can see the potential it has of becoming a much better film. Had they further developed the characters and story lines which in tail would have heightened the films suspense level and made the film more effective overall they could have really hit something great with this concept. Instead what we are left with is a mishmash of sordid horror clich\u00e9s and stolen scenes from much better films that would have served better had they been re-released in their original counterparts. That being said I'm a big fan of the found footage film and it's very rare that I don't enjoy them. I find the whole execution to be very immersive and engaging but a bad movie is a bad movie and despite some promise \"The Devil Inside\" is just that. *.5/5",

            "content": "The opening snippet was from 30oct1989 detailing a 911 call. The caller, Maria Rossi, claims to have killed three people.We jump the shark immediately thereafter. The next part of the film is 'found footage' or whatever nice phrase one uses to describe Blair Witch style worse-than-useless camera work. Someone follows the cops around the crime scene.Priest in the kitchen with the monkey wrench to the head. Nun bludgeoned in the basement with something. Priest hung in the basement with the rope. Signs that a chair was used to restrain a subject.The daughter, Isabella Rossi does a film (oi, film within a film) to help Isabella understand what went on with her mother. This film is not very good either. It's sort of better than the police mess, but not by that much.The interleaved television station news footage also sucked rocks. The main part of the narrative (outside experts who are not in Isabella's film) is recorded in a fourth style, which looks quite competent. The many cuts among these styles makes the film look like a hodge-podge of nonsense circling the bowl after flushing.After being found not guilty by reason of insanity, Maria was committed to the South Hartford State Asylum. A bit later, Maria is transferred to the Centrino Mental Hospital for the Criminally Insane in Rome, Italy. This is curious. One hopes for future exposition of motivation. Some facts came to Isabella in May of 2009 from her father. Maria was the restrained subject in the room; the two priests and the nun were performing an exorcism on Maria. The father died three days later.Eight minutes in. I hate this movie. Isabella's film is so badly made it hurts to watch it.Isabella contacts the exorcism school, and they allow her to conduct interviews and to film classes and the like. Nice of them; of course, they have been doing who knows what to Maria for 20 years.The video of the possessed patients that is shown in the school is of a fifth style, which is the worst of them all: gray on gray, low contrast, small images, iffy sound.The admission to Centrino was described to Isabella's father by the Church as an act of forgiveness. Perhaps the Church was asking for forgiveness from him for what they did to his wife.Isabella's film traces her route into Centrino, then her discussion with the chief medic, then the first visit with Maria. Maria is largely non-responsive. Maria keeps saying connect the cuts for a while. She does not recognize Isabella or the likelihood of her being her daughter. She tells Isabella that she should not have killed her child, then goes off the deep end.She meets with two of the exorcists, Ben Rawlings and David Keane, and shows them the interviews. Isabella and the exorcists delve into what's legal and not regarding exorcisms post 1999, when the Church changed the rules on the subject. They convince Isabella and crew to witness one of their off-the-books exorcisms.That involved quite a performance by Bonnie Morgan.Isabella, Keane, and Rawlings discuss what, if anything, they can do for Isabella's mother Maria.They finagle getting into Centrino and seeing Maria semi-privately with Maria in a highly medicated state. Maria goes to sleep on them, which is a sign that they are barking up the wrong tree. The Maria goes off on them, screaming with eyes widely dilated, and then proceeding to say all sorts of nasty things, in German and English.The hospital staff intervene. No surprise there.They consider options; they could approach the Church with the new video, or they could use Doctor Costa's recommendation might get a transfer back to the States.Things start to fall apart toward the end. The camera man, the exorcists, and Isabella are all upset and on edge. The Church is investigating the incident at Centrino, for one thing, and Michael is feeling massively unappreciated. David nearly drowns a baby that he was baptizing. Things get worse after that.-----Scores------Cinematography: 0/10 Uses many styles, most of which are terrible to look at.Sound: 6/10 Uneven.Acting: 8/10 The actors are fairly good at faking documentary style. The contortionist Bonnie Morgan was impressive as Rosa Sorlini.Screenplay: 8/10 Reasonably good for clear narrative and exposition of motivations. I would have rated this four stars if the camera work had been competent.",

Shot in documentary style like The Blair Witch Project, it contains some of the freakiest moments I've witnessed in this genre of late, and the excellent direction maximises the impact of every shake of the lens and bang in the background. The possessed humans are seriously creepy with their guttural voices and eerie gurning, not to mention the wall-climbing and contortion. The participants FEEL real too, and as we invest in their fate the tension is ratcheted up to almost unbearable levels.IMDb (My favourite movie site) has calculated an average rating of 4.1 for this from over 12'000 users who have voted, which I think is just ludicrous. What's the matter, because there's a bit of SUBTLETY employed here and not some guy in a hockey mask running about hacking up campers, it somehow devalues it? RUBBISH.

Made me wonder just what the Vatican really keeps hidden. The portrayals of the demon possessed actors was by far the best I have seen to date. I felt as if I was in the room with them.

Crosses. Exorcisms so boring they make The Tree Of Life look like a fast paced action epic. Various cameras which have broken zooms. Annoying possessed women doing gymnastics. Darkened areas. Cursing. A hospital. An asylum. A church. A school. Random demonic possessions. Exposition. Whining. Scares which consist of people screeching and contorting and...that's it. A stupid finale which makes no sense. A car crash which represents the movie perfectly. A web link. These are the elements that make up The Devil Inside, a lame, laughably awful and utterly worthless mess. After many awful found footage movies, we finally come to the perfect piece of evidence for opposers of the genre. This is surely, undeniably one of the worst movies in a genre full of god-awful films ever.There isn't one scary moment in The Devil Inside. All it is are cameras zooming around as possessed people screech, curse, do gymnastics and fly around. That's literally it, with intermissions of boring characters sitting around and explaining the plot. TDI may have made over a hundred times its budget at the box office but unfortunately it is less scary than a kiddy coaster at a LEGOLAND theme park. TDI is one of the most insultingly lazy films ever and absolutely no-one was trying. Every single person involved was about as good at their job as a tortoise is at winning a 100m sprint. It is a series of horror conventions, stripped to their minimum and devoid of any character or depth, pasted together. There is no kind of purpose for the Devil Inside to exist, as it fails in every single department. Even the most loyal horror fan will be unimpressed by this tedious mess and it just isn't scary at all. Likely the worst film of 2012, this is only 80 minutes but feels like 180. The worst found footage ever. And I've seen Paranormal Activity 4.0/10",

This movie is a waste of your time and money. Although I found myself continually thinking during the movie \"The Blair Witch Exorcism.\" Honestly it felt like the film was 6 parts Blair witch, 3 parts rosemary's baby and one part exorcist--that one part only because exorcism is the core theme behind the story.Like many poorly made films, this one places a preponderance of scenes inside in dark rooms and basements. This allows inept directors and writers to hide their inadequacies behind an ill deserved claim of artistic license. This film is neither artistic, nor scary. The best that it manages to deliver is a \"creepy\" feeling throughout--with a few really loud screams and a couple of noteworthy contortions. If you want a good scare, check out some classic Hitchcock--obviously the creators of this film have never seen the kind of real scare Hitchcock could deliver on film.If you absolutely loved the Blair witch project, you'll like this film--maybe. The faux Documentary worked for Blair exclusively because it hadn't been done before. Well, this film doesn't have that advantage. The shaky camera work detracts from what could have been a good storyline--can't these directors figure out that too much of one thing isn't good? The same persistent camera work detracted from cloverfield much in the same way that the long shot detracted from Children of Men. either of these types of shots can work well in small doses, perhaps even in moderation, but don't do it through the whole film.There were a few scenes in this film that DIDN'T use the archival type footage, probably because they couldn't figure out how to do internal auto scenes with it. This of course disrupts whatever suspension of disbelief the audience has managed to maintain because the camera work in these few shots is so dissimilar to the rest of the footage that it's painfully obvious that the shots are non-archival.Overweighed by the horrible cinematography, it's difficult to discern the actors and actresses performance. I imagine they, more than the theatre audiences will be horrified at this movie. They may live in fear for years for what this film will do to their careers.",

            "content": "The Devil Inside 1.5 out of 4 StarsWhat I expected from The Devil Inside and what actually appeared on screen were two entirely different things. This may sound good considering I wasn't expecting much for an early January movie by William Bell. That wasn't the case. The Devil Inside is a horribly written rehashing of all exorcism movies that came before it. It continues with the same idea of demonic possession that other movies\u2014 such as The Exorcism of Emily Rose and The Exorcist\u2014have driven into the ground. The Devil Inside offers only one small stylistic change by doing the movie like a documentary. It doesn't work.Even if this movie wasn't a rehashing of old Hollywood trash, it still would be a terrible movie. When it comes to any type of writing, there is a very simply rule that MUST be followed: It is better to show rather than tell. This means that you should show a person's personality or background rather than having it spelled out. The screenwriters\u2014William Bell and Matthew Peterman\u2014are completely unaware of this concept. The only character development is given when the actor looks directly into the camera and tells their story. You will not care what happens to these characters. In fact, the pain they suffer is rather humorous\u0085even though it obviously shouldn't be.I cringed several times at the dialog. Considering this movie was made to look like a documentary, it is essential that the dialog feels natural. It almost never does. There's even a point when the \"filmmaker\" is left speechless and simply mutters \"I don't know\u0085I don't know\u0085I don't know\" to himself. To add to this, the footage is meant to come across as raw and uncut. This is supposed to make it feel more realistic. Instead, it comes across as lazy filmmaking. Poor editing. Poor Dialogue. Poor acting. Why, then, did I not give it a lower rating? The two key exorcism scenes and the ending sequence were enjoyable despite its obvious shortcomings. The exorcism scenes are long. This is where the uncut footage actually works for the movie. These long scenes pull you in and actually add tension (something that is missing through the rest of the movie). It's an upside to the movie. Actually, it's the only upside to the movie.I can't, in good faith, recommend this movie for anyone. Don't see it. Just don't. I spent a good deal of effort at the beginning of the movie trying not to get seasick from the unstable camera (another documentary aspect that makes the movie worse). The Devil Inside is a bad excuse of a horror movie. If you want a real exorcism movie, just go rent the movie where it all began\u2014The Exorcist.",

            "content": "For starters let me say I get all the comments about films about exorcism having done all this before, repetition of previous attempts, the hand held cameras, and so on. But this film did not strike me as a attempt to invoke horror in the watching audience so much as trying to suggest that exorcism is not about good versus evil - it is the two sides of the same coin. It was as if the opening scenes were about ignorance about what good and evil are. Indeed the film hinges of a very simple phrase used very early in the film - \"you need to witness an exorcism for yourself\" - amongst an audience simply watching a recording of an exorcism. For me that was suggesting that no amount of exposure to cinema stuff is going to change your minds about anything.And so the film rather demolished its own reason for being made in one simple piece of dialogue, and yet the plot was a little more complex than that. And so the unraveling of the horror scenes and \"how did they do that\" (see credits) was a little pointless unless the film was trying hard to say something else and failed because so many people have marked it down.Personally I'd like to see the story done again with a little more time spent on the characters who do give us a clear idea of what the writer was trying to say but it just gets lost in all the horror scenes. Even some belt-line dialogue seems to fall out of place because the scene was not being carried correctly. And the unpleasantness (or the real seat of terror as words and actions rather than just actions) is lost because it is just another shock layered upon shock.And so it is overdone and ends up being less of a dish because of it. And yet the acting is at least up to cinema standards and better in some scenes. It is just a great pity the people behind it didn't make better use of promising material.",

            "content": "The Devil Inside is a quasi-good exorcism movie in the \"found footage\" sub-genre of horror. The camera work is good and the reason for the taping of the incidents in the film is also explained pretty well. Visually, this film trumps many other exorcism films in the mixture of subtle horror and shrieking terror. You notice little things that point toward demonic possession, and then you are confronted with clear signs. This makes for a nice mix; the viewer with the critical mind will get more, I think out of this film than the viewer who is less critically minded when it comes to dissecting the meaning in films.All of this is not to say, however, that this film is without flaws, because it's absolutely not. The main problems to my mind are how unexplained many of the film's phenomenon are early on and the lack of early characterization that would be of infinite value towards the end of the movie...after the \"lights go out\" scene in the mental hospital. For the post-\"light go out\" events to really have impact, we need to better know and understand our characters and who they are BEFORE this scene and the dynamic change in the film. Also, the explanations and resolution that comes toward the end are very poor. We are left with thin explanations and frail resolution. We know what happens to the demons, but if we were told more, the film could have been much better. It simply ends too chaotically and suddenly.The film seemed quite short to me; about 30 more minutes might have granted the time necessary to fix some of these problems.Also, there are some unrealistic bits... When los policia and the hospital staff get to chasing you, and you still manage to just walk right out of the hospital dragging an unconscious, demon-possessed murderer with you?? Nah... not too believable.Overall, I give this one a 4; not the worst in the world, but not really worth paying for, either. The Exorcist and The Last Exorcism are much better films if you want to watch some truly captivating demonic shenanigans.",

So yes, the ending was bad from a movie point of view, but from a logical point of view, it was real, and that is what I think they were going for. The movie itself was good, mostly surprise things, and the one exorcism was mainly for shock value. I give the movie 8/10, for minor flaws, but overall a good movie.

There was an attempt to build up the characters, but the movie was too short to do so effectively. Most importantly, it wasn't scary. The only time the audience jumped was when they dubbed in a loud audio distortion during the exorcisms - a traditional but very cheap trick to startle the audience when fear is not in the cards. There are lots of great movies playing now. This isn't one of them. Go see something else.",

            "content": "This movie is raw, unadulterated trash. What's funny is that most of its mercifully short runtime is taken up by an average found footage film that does little to distinguish itself from any other. It's a found footage film about a young woman who tries to discover the truth behind her mother's supposed demonic possession. As a possession movie and a found footage film, there's nothing you've never seen before. It could've just been an average horror movie left in the depths of obscurity. However, there is one thing that makes this movie go from being average at best to one of the worst movies ever in mere seconds: the ending. This is without a doubt the worst movie ending in the history of cinema, and that's saying something. The laziness, the greed, and the ways it plays with the audience are simply inexcusable. This goes beyond just being lazy; it tries to connect to the world outside of the film at the expense of the film itself. If you look at The Blair Witch Project when that came out back in '99, its marketing campaign incorporated real-world things like missing posters. It was excellent marketing for the movie. This, on the other hand, is a movie that is marketing. I get that it's supposed to add a sense of reality to the movie, but the way it does it is the worst possible way to do so. To go further into detail is to tread in spoiler territory. In a weird way, I kind of recommend this movie. Not because it's anything resembling good, but rather because the ending is so shockingly awful that it needs to be seen to be believed. Not only is this the worst horror movie I've ever seen, but this is also a possible candidate for being in the top 5 worst movies I've ever seen.",

The film draws on so many other sources that it has trouble establishing its own identity.Another film attempting to cash in on the recent handy-cam craze, it is a faux-documentary that follows a woman trying to discover what went wrong in her mother's exorcism 20 years prior, which resulted in the deaths of three people and a life-long spell for her mother in an insane asylum.A fairly unoriginal, but decent enough premise. The film does actually make some interesting commentary on the bureaucracy of the Catholic Church, and contains one or two well-timed scares. But the film is let down by clich\u00e9d jump-out-of-your-seat moments that you can see coming from a mile away, like the unexplained orchestral booming noise that occurs whenever the camera looks at something scary, and a ridiculously abrupt ending that stops the film dead in its tracks.If you're gonna go with the whole \"found-footage\" thing, you have to keep it discreet. It's dangerous to show too much, whereas the likes of Blair Witch and Paranormal Activity did mostly suggestion work. Heck, even Cloverfield didn't let you see too much of the monster.

Despite damning reviews therefore I saw it, and it was better than expected and certainly better than other movies I've seen. The premise of the story actually wasn't bad, take away the bigger production and indomitable presence of Anthony Hopkins in The Rite, I think this story had more potential. It was clich\u00e9, but there were some creepy moments and some of the supporting cast turned in quite compelling performances, there were also under currents to each supporting cast's character that in my opinion outshone the main lead.Which brings me to a problem with the movie, the lead character played by Andrade was flat as a pancake, lacked any screen presence and generated absolutely no sympathy from the audience, beside which the two priests played by Quarterman and Helmuth absolutely shone in comparison for me. The movie's possession scenes I found well done and although some people thought the frenetic ending strange I found it quite good and so much better than so many films that limp into the end. This film could have been much better, throw in a strong lead actress tweak some directorial and style issues and address how the documentary camera work doesn't quite get itself right, throw a bit of style and Constantine and more screen time the Priest's way and we'd have a winner. Alas we do not, but not bad. If you've put in the time for Paranormal activity you may as well for this one, don't expect much and you may be surprised.",

It follows Isabella on her mission to find her mother, Rosa, who is now in a mental hospital in Rome, Italy. It's a typical \"Paranormal Activity\" performance from the actors, who constantly pay attention to the camera, and are aware of its presence. Yes, if it was real, obviously they would be aware during the exorcism scenes, but the characters/actors are constantly referring to the camera as if it's an actual character. Now, as far as horror, building the tension is the only area in which this film succeeds. We know something is going to happen, and for the a few moments, disturbing. Yet, it plays on it way too much, and is used excessively. Personally, this only worked for the scene where we witness the first exorcism the Priests perform. After, it becomes slightly irritating being dragged on through the moment. As with most possession films, we have the typical \"noting is wrong with her\" characters, and soon, we find yet again, the body-hopping-demon that was witnessed not too long ago (a certain flop called \"Drag Me To Hell\" ring any bells?) makes a silver screen appearance. It's almost sad how many times we see this used, and audiences know, and can/will predict the outcomes of the film. If you're a movie goer regardless of what people say, and want to see if you'll enjoy it, I say go ahead. I'm that type as well. I like to form my own opinions. But, if you've seen the trailer...well, you've seen the disturbing parts....that's all the film is, slightly disturbing. Not scary in the least.

And now, let's talk about all bad things, so 3/4 of the movie.I watched \"The Rite\" and it was so-so, \"The Last Exorcism\" was also so-so. \"Devil Inside\" mix these two movies and it's very bad. The movie takes place in Vatican like in \"The Rite\" and it starts with \"The Vatican doesn't endorse this movie\". Seriously what was the point about it? The audience laughed when it appeared. The story isn't original because there is a scene in this movie which has been remake and remake again, it's when someone is possessed by a demon, and insult the priest who tries to exorcise her. That's always been fun and doesn't make this film scary, the audience also laughed.This movie use the \"Horror Reality\" process like \"Paranormal Activity\", \"REC\" and \"Blair Witch Project\". The only difference, the process of Horror-Reality is mixed with Documentary, which is pretty different from what I have seen before.

Why the hell are so many people rushing to see this steaming pile of cellu-poop???

I hear every person's reaction to the movie and EVERY SINGLE PERSON who has seen this movie at my theater has HATED it. They boo at the end, they bitch and moan, and I'm like \"Well what made you think it'd be any good anyhow???\" Also- In my theater, we only refund your money in the first 30 minutes of a movie. We give you half an hour to decide if it's crap. After that, sorry tough luck, we don't make the movies we just show 'em. Can't please everyone. Do your research before you decide what to see.

Perhaps I just can't tolerate these types of movies anymore. I feel like the movie is supposed to feel like a reality TV show in order to draw the audience in with the sense of realism. I happen to despise reality TV and all the mindless drones that watch it, which could be why I disliked the movie so much. If you think Paranormal Activity is a quality movie, you might enjoy this.

They stressed that we should mention it was a free screening. Thank God it was. If I'd paid for it I'd be darned upset. Fernanda Andrade plays Isabella Rossi, a woman who is investigating the hospitalization of her mother, Maria Rossi, played by Suzan Crowley, following three murders committed by her mother in 1989. The three murders were of two priests and a nun during an unauthorized exorcism. After her trial, Maria was found not guilty by reason of insanity and hauled off to an Italian psych hospital by the Vatican. Now Isabella wants to know more about mom, partly in fear of what might be waiting for her. The movie is told in documentary style as in the Blair Witch Project. We are introduced to Inout Grama as Michael the documentarian, and Simon Quarterman and Evan Helmuth as priests Ben and David, respectively. Ben and David believe that the Church has it all wrong. That they, as young priests and exorcists can do it better. Can you see where this is going? The movie starts out slow and stays slow for quite a while. Several people left after the first 30 min or so. Crowley gives an admirable performance as a madwoman, and as I said to Betsy afterward part of the movie was just about like being back on the the wards with some of my most acute patients. But it was all predictable, none of it scary. I wanted to give everyone a round of IM Geodon or Valium during the in-hospital exorcism, depending on whether they were psychotic or just way over neurotic. There were plot holes and an abrupt ending after 80 min. that left you going \"Huh?\" While in line we were given a small box of incense sticks. Why? I don't have a clue. Incense plays no role in the movie. I also got a down-loadable album, again not sure why. And though I didn't win in a radio promotion prize wheel game, I got a set of chemical hand warmers as a consolation. So all in all I came out slightly ahead, I guess.",

Generally for this to work, the actors have to look and act like real people and the visuals have to be presented as if they are really happening, no matter how bizarre what is being portrayed appears.It hits problems early on \u2013 Fernanda Andrade is way too good looking for us to buy her role and the actors are far too actorly, it's obvious that they are delivering dialogue and not just speaking candidly. This is at its worst early on both with the \"to camera\" monologues, the discussion at the school for exorcism and the round table chat in the pub. These are the scenes that are supposed to establish that what we're seeing is real, if we buy that it will make the later scenes more shocking. The lines are delivered as if it were a high school stage play when improvised dialogue around a theme would have worked much better.In addition, the constant switching of POVs from camera to camera wouldn't be necessary if the footage was real \u2013 if you have real footage of an exorcism, why would you cut into it? What's likely to be more visually interesting than someone possessed by a supernatural force? A real documentary filmmaker would present the sequence uncut, warts and all and let it speak for itself.Because the early scenes don't work and the filmmakers reveal a lack of confidence in their shock footage, it pushes the audience away when we're supposed to be drawn in and ultimately the film has flubbed its trump card. If you can't suspend disbelief that what you are seeing is a documentary then the film as a whole just doesn't work.Despite the bad press the flick has got, there are a couple of well executed sequences \u2013 the main camera view of the first exorcism includes some bizarre imagery and the sequences where we are introduced to the idea of demonic transference by the priest attempting to drown a baby in the baptism font and the same priests suicide are both well realised and presented matter-of-factly.Unfortunately, by this point we aren't buying the fake doc pretense, these are nothing but nice ripples on a lake of dissatisfaction and overall, despite a very brief running time, the film is actually quite boring.",

With this style of movie being so well trodden now; it is no surprise that 'The Devil Inside' does contain some familiar themes, but what's different here, is how the horror elements, have been adjusted and re-combined to render them just that little bit darker. Once you spot this is going on, it even starts to become a 'thing of itself' within the movie, which is fairly novel and bizarre. You begin to recognize familiar horror elements, and track how they have been re-moulded. In itself, this re-hashing of pre-existing ideas is nothing new, and not a problem at all. It actually becomes quite fascinting to observe how effective this approach is, as the scenes play through. There appear to be shades of influence (among others), from The Exorcist, Constantine, The Ring, The Blair Witch Project, and As Above - So Below. Despite the pros and cons of this approach, Director, William Brent Bell still manages to cunjure a coherent vision by sharing in both the writing and editing credits, which has certainly paid off. Some movies never let you forget they were made on a limited production budget. Perhaps it's something to do with the quality of the acting, direction, lighting, set composition, or all of the above. The Devil Inside, phases in and out of this phenomenon, so in one moment it's definately low-budget fare, and then in the next, it has suddenly become something else; something outsisde of that limitation. Though it stands on the shoulders of some better movies, if you can forgive it's shortcomings; 'The Devil Inside' punches well above it's weight, and delivers some edge-of-seat creepiness.

Further more, nothing irritates me more than stupid jump scares, they don't do anything else than ruin any tension there was in a scene before hand, it doesn't add to the film scare factor in anyway, and this film has a fair few of them that are plain and simply stupid. Even about 20 mins into the film I really didn't care about what was going on, what was going to happen with the characters or the story, it did nothing to get me interested, and everything after that just got worse. Which brings me to the ending, I think I can easily say it is dumbest ending of a film ever, it made absolutely no sense it truly felt like the writers couldn't think how to wrap up the film, it was just so stupid!

I feel no shame in listing this review as 'Non-spoiler', because there is nothing to spoil. This is among the most predictable and generic horror films I have ever seen. Nothing of originality, nothing to offer a veteran horror fan, and even less for a newcomer to the genre. When I rate a film 1 star, I mean to say that not only does the film have no value, it has anti-value. It causes nothing but harm to its peers and embarrasses an entire community of films by association.The film's acting is a joke. Delivered with the passion of an Ikea lamp, and with the originality of bad haircut. The 'main characters' are unlikable assholes, portrayed as much through the dialogue as the acting. The film's 'script' is a dirty, sodden dishcloth, every jump-scare is a stain upon it. This horrendously trite slice of nothingness failed to even achieve an 85 min runtime, likely because they avoided inconveniences such as character or plot. The film cares so little for its audience that it even insults the .01% of said audience who enjoyed it. It does this by failing to end. The film has NO ENDING. The last frame of the film is a link to a now defunct web domain (the studio was so cheap it only paid for 6 months on the website, a website referenced in every version of the film!).This crap surpasses Frankenstein (1994) as the worst horror film I have ever reviewed.

Believe me, I've seen some sucky movies in my life (i.e Epic Movie, Date Movie, etc...) but this one wins the prize as the worst movie ever. For one, the ludicrous plot, possessed woman who is a US citizen offs three American priests and gets extradited to Italy to serve her years in at the Centrino Hospital for the Criminally Insane which for your information doesn't exist. Why would a US Citizen be extradited to Italy to serve in an insane asylum. Well because she killed priests. This means she has to serve time in an insane asylum run by the Vatican. There is no such city or town near Rome or in Italy named Centrino that has a Hospital for the Criminally Insane especially one that is run by the Vatican. The word \"Centrino is a denomination of the word Cientro which is the Italian word for Center. In other words \"Centrino Hospital for the Criminally Insane\" is actually \"Center or Central Hospital for the Criminally Insane\", very creative. I further support the fact the hospital was made up because of the fact that the guard for the hospital speaks very crappy Italian with an American accent. Talking about accents, most of the characters that are supposed to be Italian are not Italian as they all speak crappy Italian with very bad American accents. I wouldn't hire these people to work as spies in Italy because their crappy American accents would give them away, these people would probably blend in better if they just stuck to English. In fact, during the video showing a girl possessed by a demon the demon who is possessing her speaks Italian with an American accent. This tells me that Demons hold either American or British nationalities. I was born in Italy and I am very good at detecting non-native Italian Speakers especially the ones who have American accents. To be honest I don't think this film was filmed in Italy because why would American actors be hired to portray Italians. Wouldn't it be cheaper to hire Italian actors to play Italians while you are in Italy filming a movie? The next point, while Italy is a very educated country, the odds of finding ordinary Italians (such as the possessed girls mother) speaking English even broken English are very low. In other countries like Germany or Austria your odds of finding someone speaking English is much higher. In the tourist centers such as Rome you will find people who speak English but not in the country side. Out of my entire Italian family only my mom speaks English and that is because she was married to my father who was in the US Army. English is not always used in every day Italian life. The bottom line, this movie sucked big. I don't think you should characterize this as a horror movie because I laughed at most of it. I found it funny that you can get possessed by being burped on. There are so many questions that will never be answered such as what is so scary about a blind person. Yes, I'm talking about the blind nun that is all over the marketing for this film. She is just a passerby in the street and doesn't play any part what so ever in this film. I think even the producers of this piece of garbage felt that their movie sucked so they decided to end it abruptly with that god awful ending. Don't attempt to go to the website at the end of the movie to find answers. You won't get any. The www.therossifiles.com is just a website filled with scenes from the movie. It looks like the producers ran out of ideas and just wanted to make a quick buck which they did. All in all, the only thing scary about this movie is this piece of crap managed to lure me in like a dummy and steal 75 minutes of my life I'll never get back and also my $10 for the ticket. I think I'm just going to out, film some blind people who speak Italian with bad American accents and make my own scary movie and become a millionaire.",

As I mention before, The Devil Inside offers nothing new to the story for the exception of a couple of scenes that will make you jump out of your seats. Unfortunately, this is not enough to mend the damaged inflicted by this fictitious tale. The inconsistencies within the film are far too many to ignore. The movie is supposed to play as a documentary but you will notice that this is not always the case. At times it feels as if you were watching a really low budget horror movie with very bad acting. Yes, as if the bad story wasn't bad enough, the acting in this film was pretty bad but it was the best thing this movie had to offer.Now, put all this mishaps together and add one of the worst ending in film history, what you'll get is The Devil Inside. The overall execution was mediocre at best. This might be scary for a 10 year old kid but not to your general moviegoer and especially not to a avid horror fan. If you want to see (essentially) the same movie with better acting, watch \"The Rite\" with Anthony Hopkins. It's already on DVD and it wont cost you an arm and a leg. If you are in the mood for some devilish movies, stick to the originals: The Exorcist, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, The Amityville Horror, etc...By Raymond Melendez www.MovieFloss.com",

I rented this tonight and wow, I was just utterly disappointed at this movie. It's not scary, it made me jump at like 2 scenes but mainly because the sound was really loud not because it was scary. The acting in this movie isn't that great, and the story is missing tons and tons of important plot points. Don't even get me started on the ending, that was the worst ending I have ever seen in my life!! If you're looking for a scary movie I recommend \"The Exorcist\", THE BEST EXORCISM MOVIE EVER!!! However, if the idea of exorcisms interests you and you want to learn and get a better idea about them, then watch \"The Last Exorcism\" or \"The Rite\" instead, I really like both of those movies and they provide good insight on exorcisms. Stay away from this movie though, it's not even worth your time even if you are bored out of your mind one day and want to watch a scary flick. Skip this one!!!!!!",

No real script, no music, bouncy cameras that made you nauseas and a pool of mis-information. It was clear that the audience was primed to see a good, scary movie. There was even the sense that the audience wanted to roll with the action, and then, bang! The movie just ends out of nowhere. You're left with \"oh, I actually put up with that\"?!",

I'm not saying it won't scare anyone, but it was just boring and predictable to me. I kept on watching because I was curious if there was going to be a great ending or scene. Unfortunately, no. When Isabella finally showed the signs of possession in the hospital, I thought: \"Here we go, now the movie will make a turn for the better\". But again, I was disappointed. The car ride just was a big mess, creating questions you get no answers to. And then the ending... please! Especially when the words appear on screen about the Rossi files and to check the website. What is this? What are they trying to accomplish here? Do they want you to think this is all actual footage? It got a little \"Blair witch project\" there. I checked the site and really, that was just as bad as the movie in my opinion.I'm just glad I didn't pay any money to see this movie and if you ask me: \"Should I see this movie?\" I would answer you this: It's up to you, but I thought it was not worth it.

When I saw the credits rolling I was sitting there thinking that had to be a joke, that couldn't be the end of the movie, you can't just end a movie like that, I hate movies that end like that, where they just stop in the middle of everything. If a movie has that kind of ending I can't help but think it's total crap. I also didn't like the fact that it was made like a documentary; while that gave it a scary aspect I would have enjoyed it much more, and still have been scared, if it had been in a normal movie type format.

            "content": "Set inside the famous Vatican, The Devil Inside tells of a chilling yet not so suspenseful story. Embarking on an adventure to find out what happened to her mom, an Italian woman goes through a series of exorcisms to find out all the answers she needs. Combined with theory, suspense, religion, and found footage, The Devil Inside presents an interesting take on a thriller movie. With found footage present in the film, there is an interesting way to look at how the film was made. Using the shaky camera technique makes the film interesting and keeps the viewer on their toes a little bit more. The film could also be conveyed a lot scarier as well. Due to the way the movie was shot, more people through the movie were based upon a real life story, which was originally intended by the director. Watching The Devil Inside allows the viewer to observe through a critical lens. It goes slightly into the Roman Catholicism religion and uses the Vatican as a base for its exorcisms. Oddly enough, at the beginning of the film, a notice reads that the Vatican had no part to do with the filming of this movie. Throughout this movie, the dialogue becomes very suspenseful. Scenes of the scary mom and her outrageous tantrums occur throughout the movie, which makes it difficult to put together at times. To sum everything up, I truly believe the film could have been made a little better. In this film, the character of the woman is the main focus. She is set out to find answers and clear things up. However, I felt that the role she played was very subtle and not great. The acting I felt could have been better. I also see this film in a point of view perspective where everything that happens is the way the daughter sees it. She knows there is some kind of spirit possessing her mom and knows she needs to get rid of it. Moreover, the film The Devil Inside offers viewers a way to look what is going on by the atmosphere. The woman is constantly dealing with voices and spirits in addition to being inside the Catholic Church. Having the Vatican in the background allows for a good movie setting for this. In conclusion, looking at the visceral way of thinking, I felt that I did not get anything out of it. The movie is not scary and attempts to make use of the exorcism idea to bring that out.",

If that sounds bonkers, what I mean is that the actors for the most part pulled off a rare achievement: appearing NOT to be actors, but seeming to be real people. I can only assume that those reviewers who rated the acting as awful spend too much of their time in movieworld and have forgotten how real people sound, i.e. unprepared, off-the-cuff and uncertain rather than speaking as if they obviously know their lines. In this respect, this film was remarkably realistic. On the whole 'exorcism' issue, this film also contained one of the most intelligent debates on the 'Possession versus mental illness' arguments that I've seen. So in conclusion, if you want a formulaic, shock-horror fright-fest, don't watch this. If, however, you want an intelligent film with 'real life' dialogue instead of smoothie-polished Hollywood glitz, and a different take on the 'religion versus science' question of exorcism then watch this with an open mind and enjoy a non-mainstream film.",

I didn't go into this thinking I was seeing the Exorcist.The main problem people have with the movie, is the ending. I understand what the filmmakers were trying to do and it was ballsy in a way, to just abruptly end it the way they did. Too many times in movies, endings are predictable and to satisfy the masses, edits are done - and with some moviegoers, they need a more simple explanation and some sort of movie closure. It's not hard to understand the final result of the movie, but they probably should have polished off the ending and left this version as an alternate on the DVD. I never saw this in the movies, but on DVD - so I can understand the boos this movie got by someone paying $10+ a ticket (plus extras) and winding up with this result.Still though, this wasn't bad at all and worth watching at least once if you're a fan of the genre.",

I tend to have reasonably low standards for the kind of acting that will still allow me to feel engaged and invested in a movie. And even so, I was constantly brought out of the movie with thoughts of how forced the tension was being rendered by the actors. The scenes in between the \"scary\" moments were disjointed and awkward. The \"scary\" moments left the audience with a general feeling of \"what??\".I am not the only one that felt this way. When the ending - such as it was - happened and the credits rolled, the entire audience started laughing and heckling the screen. It has been a long time since I felt like I wanted to walk out on a movie, but in this case I wish I had trusted my gut. At least my afternoon could have been salvaged.In short, even with a rich history and mythology to work from, this movie failed to hit the mark of even a mediocre film. The special effects were minimal and tastefully subtle, which is fine. But the acting and the writing were absolutely terrible. The ending looked as though they were about as tired of making the film as I was of watching it. This film is a rental at best.

I watched it last night after reading all the reviews and hearing about the \"horrible ending\" and such. I also am admittedly not a fan of \"found footage\" movies as a whole, but I'll give anything a try before casting stones. With that said, many people have proclaimed this to be \"the worst movie ever made\" and other undeserved things. In reality, there are far worse films out there. Thousands of them. In fact, I have more respect for what these folks did with a minimal budget than I do most \"blockbuster\" offerings from Hollywood and other cinematic hubs around the world. However, the film does fall short as the story unravels. The movie starts off very promising. There is some respectable character development going into the film. The multiple cameras used and editing are good too. I felt a genuine sense of compassion for both Isabella and her mother, as well as for the priests. Where the film fell short with me was in how it breaks apart towards the end of the second act. I won't offer details, but what people have said about the story crumbling and the ending leaving people let down is mostly valid. However, there is much to be appreciated in the efforts behind this movie. It certainly isn't a total waste. In fact, I felt it was better executed than \"The Last Exorcism\" and other genre pieces. I do wish that they had offered us a real ending, and that they had kept the focus on the Rossi family and not dived into so many subplots and such. So, for those who are worried that this movie is a total waste - it isn't. There are some great moments in it for sure. A noble effort. At the same time, the rumors about the crumbling storyline and the \"disappointing\" ending are unfortunately rooted in something. That said, while I won't be adding a purchased copy to my video collection, I can't say that is wasn't worth at least one viewing.",

            "content": "This is not a review. This is a warning. Don't go to see this film. Just don't. It's so poor it's not even good in a 'laugh at a bad movie' way. I recently went to see this at the cinema and I'm glad someone else paid for my ticket because if I'd spent my own money seeing this abomination I'd probably be in tears by now.For a kick off it's filmed in a 'mockumentary' style, with a bouncing, swaying, often far to zoomed in camera angle. Now you may argue this style has been picked by the director to make the exorcisms more intense and frightening. Except all the exorcism scenes are filmed with fixed viewpoints. The only time the camera flails around is when the characters are talking to outline the story. Utterly pointless. And annoying. Secondly the acting is mostly dire. The main character, Isabella, isn't terribly portrayed although I never got the impression she really cared about her mother or was interested in exorcisms. Other characters were just pathetic, notably Father Ben and especially Michael the cameraman, who is utterly two-dimensional. Admittedly the acting isn't all bad, with a solid performance from Evan Helmuth (Father David) and a rather good sinister portrayal of a possession victim by Suzan Crowley (Maria Rossi), who was hampered only by the appalling lines she was given, which we will get to now.Finally, and worst of all, is the storyline. Words may not be able to describe this empty, pointless void of a script, filled with plot holes, laughable dialogue and embarrassing attempts at horror. Despite this, I will try.The concept of the film is that Isabella must travel to Italy to discover the facts behind the murder's her mother committed years before. She the meets renegade priests Ben and David (who smoke and swear throughout the film, I'm no expert but that seemed wrong), who are preforming exorcisms behind the Vatican's back. Then pointless filler is endured for around 40 minutes before they go to check if Isabella's mother is possessed (why not do this first, it's the point of the entire film?). The spirit then jack-knifes between characters with no real reason other than to prolong the film until you reach what will be, unless you are especially unfortunate, the worst event of your life. The ending of The Devil Inside. I won't ruin the horrific beauty of it here, but suffice to say, I laughed out loud. People in my cinema booed. And 10 seconds before the end I literally turned to the person next to me and said \"If this film ends now it will be the worst movie I've ever seen\". The credits then Rolled. In my humble opinion the writer of this cesspool of cinematographic vomit (William Brent Bell) should receive a lifetime ban from pen and paper, word processing software and anything sharp that he could use to carve words into things, for the good of the species as a whole. Please William for the sake of us all, never write anything again. Ever. Please .",

It's just not surprising or scary anymore. It also has many goofs and loose ends. (But hey, it's found footage, you can't expect found footage to give you all the answers...) Average performances and the typical plot. So, I guess I enjoyed it because my expectations weren't high considering how predictable this kind of movie has become lately. What makes me sad is that most of the keyboard critics rate it the lowest possible because of the ending. Why? Is the movie so predictable that you all need it to end the same way? Would it be better if the daughter freed her mother, maybe dying in the process, leaving at least one character to have a happy ending? the priest sacrificing his life to save the rest? the cameraman, as dumb as he looks, being butchered by a horde of \"transparenting\" demons? I think the ending is one of the things that may differentiate this movie from others. It's abrupt, inconclusive, violent. Not that I believe this could happen for real, but isn't it a very likely outcome if we imagine a situation like that happening in real life? If you don't agree then you must be clear that you want realistic, found footage movies to have Hollywood style, highly predictable endings.",

I am not an exorcist.I don't understand why all these exorcism \"experts\" who've seen a million exorcism movies have an issue with this movie. They keep saying its clich\u00e9 and not original. How original can you really make the idea of possession without making it something completely new? Demon possession has been made entertainment for DECADES even before movies were made about it. In verbal stories possession has been immortalized before now. Human possessed, talking crap, contorting. That's what its about, if you don't want to see that or feel that's not good enough, then why are you watching yet another exorcism movie? Something that is what it is, is what it is... For instance, if I made a movie about my dog licking his own privates, wouldn't that be the same movie as your dogs? Sure the angle might be different but licking is basically licking.SOOOOOOOO in defense of this movie, I have seen a few exorcism movies and this one was different to me. Very different. It got so interesting to see the others go through their changes after being possessed and I thought it said something about the mothers possession as well. That gradual change would have been interesting to see before she murdered everyone, but that was left out. The characters changed slowly, some faster than others, but it was shocking to me sometimes to see how they were behaving. My mouth was open at times without my prior knowledge, and in shock.I did not like how fast the movie ended after they were possessed though. I wanted to see more and I was curious about the priest who did not seem possessed, because there were four demons in the mother. Either one stuck with the mother or, this particular priest was possessed and just evolving more slowly than the others.And as far as the ending goes... It seems to me like these exorcism \"experts\" are just mad because they didn't get a definite happy (possession free) (or sad (everyone dies) for that matter) ending. You were left wondering and in some cases that pisses me off, but this was almost perfect. To me it shows how truly mysterious demonic possession is! It shines a light on \"weird incidents\". Like have you ever seen a news story and wonder, \"Why weren't they...\" or \"how could they...\" I'm sure when the authorities showed up to that accident scene they were confused as heck, just like we are sometimes in life. Confused about peoples behavior.All and all, I would recommend this movie. It's not a jump out of your seat kind of movie but I found it very interesting and it caused me to think and reflect a lot! There was not a dull moment for me.And as a side note, reviewers, stop trying to put things in a box while also expecting them to be creative. You say this was clich\u00e9 by comparing it to other movies and neglect to see the things about it that are truly unique.",

            "content": "I love horror movies, especially supernatural thrillers. I also love found footage movies (the good ones, at least), so when I heard about this movie, I was intrigued; the trailers alone were enough to keep me up at night. Finally on opening weekend, I sat down in a crowded theater hoping to be treated to a memorable, horrifying experience. Sadly, when I left the theater, I felt robbed of the 7 or so dollars I paid to see this, which is a shame because it actually was a good movie, up until the ending which ruined all of it. Let's start from the beginning, shall we? The movie opens with police footage of a multiple-murder scene, which leads to them discovering the culprit: a woman who appears to be almost feral and saying odd things. This is Maria Rossi, the vessel the supposed demons have possessed. Fast forward a little bit and her daughter, Isabella, travels to Maria's mental asylum in Italy to prove that her mother's actions were the act of demons and not insanity, which is the authorities' belief. To do this, she enlists the help of a trio of unconventional exorcists and together they learn that the force they're up against may be more than any of them can handle. What I like about this movie is that its possessions are very realistic in that they don't rely on levitation, projectile vomiting, or any other of the usual exorcism movie parlor-tricks, thereby allowing you to question whether the individuals are really possessed or simply insane. The movie also has a hyper-realistic feel in that it is shot not only in found-footage, but almost exactly like a documentary, adding to the chills. To be able to illicit such scares with so little actually shown definitely takes talent.Sadly, such talent is wasted due to a few problems. One is the obvious glaring plot hole of why an American mental patient who's committed murder is being sent to a mental asylum all the way in Italy, but I suppose you could suspend your disbelief of that long enough to get through the movie. The second problem is not so forgivable: the ending. Oh man, the ending completely destroys all the good things this movie had going for it. Now, I understand that most found-footage movies do tend to lose their way towards the end, but \"The Devil Inside\" really did it. Without giving too much away, I'll just say that the ending was abrupt and anticlimactic. It was almost like the movie was building up to a climax, but then just...bam, the end. Right at the end of the second act. I felt ripped off, the friends I went with felt ripped off, the whole theater started calling out \"that's it?\" and \"seriously?\". I only hope that there is a \"Devil Inside 2\", if nothing else to finish this story properly! It was actually good starting out, but that ending just destroyed the entire movie and left it feeling incomplete. Such a shame.",

Not only do we have a home footage style movie that gives you the usual nauseous feelings but the whole concept of exorcism has been done 10 times over.

Over acted to the point where you wonder if they're even going off a script. In trying to make it genuine real footage, discovered by the cops blah blah blah you just start to get annoyed because you know fine well it's all bullsh*t.My advice, stick on the Exorcist again or even the original Nightmare on Elm Street if you want a couple of cheap, silly scares!!!",

I wanted to all refer to a movie movie plot not give reports and stuff about people being possessed. what makes it scary is that anyone can be prey for the devil to take control of. their are evil spirits of all kinds. a spirit can movie from one to the other like that simple. I felt pretty creeped at points and it is a bit scary because this is real in real life and it relates to people who been in these situations. the ending sucked and creeped me out a lot cause the evil spirits caused their death to all innocent souls. and this shows what an evil spirit of Satan is.

But what made it so un-satisfying I can't quite put my finger on. It started off 'real' or at least felt it, but maybe some of it was forced, the guy who played the director in the movie, kept on taking me out of the movie, he was the worst. The heavy set priest wasn't bad, but he did lose me once during the movie, like he was pushing a little, definitely missed one or two of his moments, but overall he wasn't bad, not an easy role, and the skinnier priest, main girl and mother did their jobs, in the end I felt the director character was painful to watch and everyone else good to really good. Was that guy the director of the movie and he put himself in the movie? Just the same, what was the problem, why was everyone in the theater so let down when the end credits popped up? Why the so many \"That's it?\" rumbles. Is it that the third act just became poop and ended without proper resolve, or really any at all.

I understand the affect the directors are trying to make getting you to live the story more closely. My biggest problem when watching this POV style is, I always find myself asking who is watching the video in order for us to be watching it now. Starting off with the murders supposedly committed by the mother, shown in Police Video files, to the daughter's documentary style investigating her mothers possession, I kept wondering at times, when was this filmed and who found it. And if this is a documentary by the daughter why was she doing it? Was she a film maker, art student, internet blogger, I could not remember why she was filming it. Why at this point of her life did she feel was the right time to investigate it? Just too many questions for me to totally be engrossed in the movie. If you want to engage the audience the back story needs to be clear, such as the Blair Witch movie.Overall it did have some scares and the special effects kept me interested in watching.

I did find it kind of slow to get going but once it did I enjoyed it and didn't get bored. For me it really was easy to feel with the characters and fall into the realism. Of course there are parts that are clearly fake and ridiculous like in any horror movie. Putting that aside I felt the fear, tension, and uncomfortable moments. While its not the best out there, to me personally, its a good one and worth a try if you are a fan of these types of movies.",

Some parts of the movie could have been expanded and helped to create a terrifying horror film. The main problem that I have is with the way that it was filmed. I do realize that it was in the form of a documentary therefore the third person camera view. However that doesn't mean that the camera should be constantly out of focus and bouncing around. (was the cameraman supposed to be very bad at his job? ). I found trying to watch this movie in the theatre very difficult due to the camera work. I don't know if anyone involved with the movie might read this, but if you are please stop with the constant camera shaking. In well timed situations to get the mood, no problem. But not the entire movie, it's just nauseating. Other than that as I said in the beginning it was a pretty good film. I'd give it 7/10. If I could have looked at the screen the whole time but will drop it to 5/10 because of the camera shake. (cloverfield reminiscent).",

With all the hype, I thought it could have been better, like demons lurking or EVP from the tapes. It was still unclear for the fate of those exorcised, or anyone.It was hard seeing this as a documentary/movie due to the actors looking coached or to rehearsed.

This film is terrible, it's far from the worst film I've ever watched, as despite all its problems, it was quite enjoyable.There were many inconsistencies and quite a few flaws in both acting and dialogue. The swearing from the possessed was incredibly comical and the way one of the characters crawled up the walls simply made this film like a rip-off of The Exorcist. It seemed more like a horror film by Friedberg & Seltzer turned serious, along with the cinematography of the Blair Witch Project. Also, for a movie supposedly designed to be as if it actually happened - the script seemed very rehearsed especially at parts during exorcism scenes. The ending was probably the worst part, you could see what the director was trying to achieve: confusion in the audience as to what will happen next, a seriously poor cliffhanger. In todays society, you can't simply just finish movies like that, it was uneventful (like most of the film). If they are making a sequel, I most certainly will not be seeing it.Yet despite my overall dislike of the film, I didn't walk out. I suppose I didn't want to feel like I wasted money on a ticket.",

Wait until it comes on television, and even then, if you have something important to do with your life, don't pass it up for this hour and a half of mess.There was a great sense that there was no true writing in this film. They started shooting it, and then said to one another, \"Oh yea, let's do that next, and then we can do this!\" And then it seemed they ran out of ideas, so let's throw everyone upside down, and leave a cliffhanger. This left the audience confused and frustrated. I could hear the \"huh?\" in everyone's voices, mixed with a clap or two. I wasn't really sure how to feel until I walked out and really thought about it. And I also really wondered if I would ever sit through a sequel to hopefully give me a sense of closure. There were even some scenes that had no point in the film whatsoever. \"Girl storms out of insane asylum and can't find her keys.\" Why? What was the point? Did Demon Mommie Dearest steal them to let herself into her apartment halfway around the world? We will never know!!! Why did the cameras black out for a moment?? Why even point it out? No answers, to which I would assume that the whole reason for the blackout was a demon passing or something of that nature, not even sure. There were far too many details that created setup after setup for a situation without any resolution, and during what would have seemed to be the rising to an actual climactic moment (in my head I was thinking, finally(!), this is getting good), it all just ends, very poorly. If this had been Die Hard, Bruce Willis would have stood up from the wreckage and cleaned the floors with the villains faces for another hour, but in this case, I guess that's all they had, so we are left with what felt like half a film. The only plus, is that I do appreciate the way that the exorcisms were portrayed, and if I'm going to see an exorcism movie, I want to see an exorcism!! I gave this film 3 stars for dumb luck; in my opinion the actual exorcism scenes were better than The Last Exorcism, The Rite, Paranormal Activity 2 (only because, we couldn't see it, only heard it), and The Exorcism of Emily Rose (because she really just screamed a lot).

Whereas I stay in my room and watch horror movies all night and never contribute to society or interact with another human being in person unless I absolutely have to, people in their hundreds come together to supply my need for adrenal exertion so that I can go online and post reviews about what they spent eight months making and I spent eighty minutes watching.That said, I'm trying to be nice with this move.

Back then, I thought it was possibly the scariest movie ever!I was also still living in fear of The Blair Witch Project's VHS dust slip. All things considered I have to give this movie some points for effort-- I haven't seen too much of science and religion in horror movies, at least not on the exorcism front. Though, this movie is just riddled with tropes and the ending is absolutely terrible from all angles. Story architecture is supposed to work like a hill-- you work up to the main conflict and afterwards everything starts to calm down. However, in this story, we work up to the main conflict and instead of being able to step off the escalator it keeps going, and now you're looking down at your family and friends who have watched normal movies with normal story arcs who are on the way back down the hill and you're frantic and panicking because you're supposed to be down there-- This is not how stories work!

A possessed woman, Maria Rossi (played by Suzan Crowley) flips out during her exorcism, allegedly murders all those participating, is found not guilty by reason of insanity during the trial, is then locked away inside a hospital and eventually shipped off to another one in Rome. (All of which we learn in basically the first 3 minutes of the movie) Cut to sometime latter, when the now adult daughter of this woman, Isabella (Fernanda Andrade), decides to make a documentary about her mother and travels to Italy, to interview her and visit an exorcism school, where she meets two priests who engage in extra curricular activities that may or may not involve unauthorized exorcisms, since at this school, they apparently frown on that sort of thing, surprisingly.As expected with this type of movie, creepy stuff is caught on film. What is ultimately important about this type of movie to us, is whether or not that creepy stuff works. Does it work? For the most part, yes it actually does. Quite well at times.PROSA pretty ballsy, if somewhat expected ending.Effective opening scene walk through of the aftermath of Maria's failed exorcism. Looks and feels like you are going through a real crime scene.Contortionists rule!While I've never had a problem with shaky cam, ever, I don't think those who do will have a problem with this movie.CONSThat ballsy ending is definitely not for everyone and has turned off a great deal of viewers.FINAL SCOREI think we can all agree that the \"Found Footage\" sub-genre has pretty much worn out it's welcome in 2013, but for all we know, after the dust settles 10-15 years from now, maybe we might be inclined to give this style of cinema a second chance. And I think in that time, when looking back, The Devil Inside (2012) might be considered one of the better found footage movies. As long as they don't make a bunch of sequels ruining the original. Don't get me wrong, The Devil Inside is not great a movie, but if you don't mind watching another found footage movie (I don't blame anyone who does), I do think The Devil Inside is a good movie.6/10 stars",

First: I live in Italy, and more or less all the spoken Italian in the movie is awful, it sucks and this that makes the movie really fake to me, considering it's supposed to be filmed in Italy. I think this detail is a big mistake for a movie that claims to be a documentary-like movie. I know it probably doesn't make any difference to someone who doesn't understand a word of this language, but I couldn't feel involved for a single minute in the movie because of this. Other than that, the plot is really predictable, especially the end (but it makes sense, a predictable end for a predictable movie). If you saw \"The Blair Witch Project\" you can find so many similarities that you could think it's an exorcism-adaptation of that movie. Too many cheap/trash ideas (multiple possession, bible's pages, reversed crosses, great imagination!). The only reasons I would watch this movie is just for some nice exorcism scenes. But nothing more. I give a 4. A movie to watch if you have really nothing else to do.",

The movie starts out well enough, but gets sidetracked and feels rushed towards the end. What made The Exorcist so scary was the build-up and the atmosphere. Every scene in this movie - particularly the exorcism scenes - feels rushed. It starts to get interesting with the others becoming possessed, but they end that quickly too with the stupid ending. It's almost as if they ran out of funds and decided to end it there. I forget what the term was, but where demons jump into other peoples' bodies - this should have been explored further. They could have made it interesting with each of them becoming possessed, but nothing. It ends suddenly in a car crash. Also, why not explore the one priest's problems? The demon was taunting him about his uncle I'm assuming and how he wanted him to die, but they never explored this. I don't know. It was OK I suppose, but it really could have been a good movie had they taken their time with the story and some scenes.",

And lastly, a lot isn't explained too clearly, but I suppose that's a given with movies using this \"found footage\" gimmick.

We formed a small mob and marched to the manager, where thankfully we got vouchers to see a real movie. Sorry, but micro-budget films have their limitations and a good trailer and marketing can make anything look good. Even this sad excuse for a film.Where do we start? The story. Well this had some potential and the set-up led me to believe that the movie could get good. Unfortunately, the film maker became victim to his own story telling conventions and the documentary style shaky camera began to hinder the story. He became trapped in trying to keep realism and the camera work, lighting and set-ups were so bad, they gave me a headache. The story got weighed down in docu-drama dialogue, and trying to make the documentary realism, lost all the traits of good writing. Gone were the subtext, character development and purpose to scenes which build momentum in a great story. The direction was focused on creating a pseudo-realism that kept the film flat and unemotional. The funny thing was, that in the edit, they used shots that were not from the documentary camera and no explanation of an added cameras in that scene was given. This is funny later in the film, they make blatant mention of additional cameras. The on screen title information with dates and times of the footage was distracting and not necessary for every shot in some sequences. This whole story had holes the size of boulders and unfortunately there was so much promise lost in bad filmmaking.Was it scary? Ask my wife? She gets scared at the stupidest things and can't take scary movies too well. She was terrified of the trailer and reluctant to go. But she said she would, because I wanted to see it. COORS LIGHT COLD HARD FACT: She was never scared and mostly disinterested. Only one scene made her remotely uncomfortable and her overall impression was the rest of the movie sucked so bad that one good scene wouldn't do it.The acting. Maybe this was some of the saving grace. Solid performances for a no name cast. Nothing terrible, but nothing incredible. The production value. This was the worst offender. The so called documentary film maker who was a character in this film looked like a normal competent human being. His so called camera work was so horrible that you would have thought this was an epileptic toddler holding the camera. They made no use of the beautiful visuals Rome had to offer and if this so called documentary filmmaker was real, any idiot gets b-roll and some establishing shots.The editing was clunky and unfortunately the director/editor fell victim to his own story- telling device and his attempt at pseudo-realism offered little choices in the use of sound design or score. The minimalist effects only added to a micro-budget feel that felt like a bad student film.THE WINNER!! Insurge/ Paramount bought this kiddie project for a cool mil, so you know it cost a lot less and turned it into a bread winner with a trailer and minimal marketing. WOW.. Marketing wins again.. I AM SO GLAD MY $30 WAS NOT PART OF THE PROFIT. I GOT MY MONEY BACK.. YES YES YES.",

I'll try to explain why:Most of the parts that would be considered scary (but weren't at all really) are in the trailers. You can get the full experience (minus the disappointment of wasting your money) from the trailers, in my opinion.The only bit that had anyone scared in the cinema was a cheap jump scare when you're not expecting it - and guess what - it comes from a dog who's bark has been amplified to a volume level that would make anyone jump. This is lame and cheap to the point it's not even funny.It's flawed, if it follows demon lore that many other films follow. One of the demons, at one point, walks into a church dressed with robes and crosses, puts his hand in holy water and doesn't flinch. Now, there's multiple things wrong with this - first off demons are said not to be able to walk on holy ground (a church). He's dressed with a cross on, which supposedly repels the demons (and they're used as a weapon in the film - so what the hell was going on there I don't know), and demons are also repelled by holy water, which again is used as a weapon in this film.The ending. Dear god the ending. This film quite possibly has the worst and most abrupt ending I've seen in a movie. When things get interesting it cuts off, bringing up the credits and leaving you feeling massively ripped off.Please, if you consider yourself as a movie lover and respect yourself, do not go see this movie as you'll want to be in a shower for the next month to clean off the crap this film is.",

However, this whole picture, turned upside down in the blink of an eye, when suddenly the movie ends in the middle of the climax of the plot. I will be completely sincere now, I raged. But I wasn't the only one, as the whole crowd of people made their own comments and noises of dissatisfaction. If you ask me, why this movie was a complete waste of time, is because of the ending. That movie, deserved a better ending, and it had all the likes of going into a better ending. Whomever feels this movie is great, I tolerate their opinion. I was expecting a good horror movie and got just that until the end, and even though many of you will disagree for me the ending can and in this case, did destroy the whole movie.

I jumped out a cupboard once and scared my girlfriend worse than she was scared at this but I would never dream of charging about \u00a38 for people to witness that.The ending was as if whoever made this film felt the same way as I did watching it and just said F*@* it, I give up, about an hour and a half later than they should have.

Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed, and found myself laughing from humor, rather than jumping from fright.I'll give it that it is a very VISUAL movie, featuring contorted bodies, bloody corpses, and a guy shooting himself in the face flat out on camera in front of God and everybody (pun intended...)were enough to make me wince.The film starts out incredibly slow. Literally, NOTHING happens for at least 3/4 of this film. Once events did begin to occur, everything was predictable. I'd also like to add that I honestly believe if this WASN'T set up as a \"found footage\" documentary-style film, it may have done better. I got dizzy several times during the film and had to avert my eyes off the screen until I could balance myself again -- and at one point, I did miss a \"scary\" part because I wasn't looking at the screen.According to my Catholic movie-buddy, this movie is \"creepy as ****\" from a Catholic standing, which I can understand. Otherwise, it's quite a bit of a disappointment, and everyone involved with the movie could have done a MUCH better job...",

It's redeeming factor was that you simply wanted to know the demon's name, and even that never came to fruition. Sad, sad hour and a half that I won't be getting back.",

The scary blind nun plays no role in the movie, she is only a passer by on the street once. The crazy cuts and scary scenes you see in the commercial are basically the movie. There is nothing new in this film that hasn't been done multiple times. It's also only an hour and 20 minutes long. I don't know why they cut it short since it's lacking an ending and only sparks more confusion. The mother only has about 3 small cameos as well which is disappointing since she was the only true highlight to the movie. It has it's required shock/gore scenes but is lacking on story. It doesn't have the chill effect of Paranormal or a strong story/character development like The Others or Constantine. Knowing it's fake makes it seem like a badly told ghost story. No one in Dayton, Ohio at the 9 showing seemed to like it, we all left the theater talking about how it was a complete waste. I do not recommend this movie, wait for it to come to Red Box and rent it as a last resort.",

Where you know the demon takes over Katies body and shes no longer alive, kills Mica, looks at the camera w the creepy smile then goes at the camera....or end it in PA 2, where you know she takes the baby Hunter.

Seeing it alone I felt as though I was making a bad decision, that I would end up wishing that I would have brought a friend. But, with the couple horizontal in front of me as a side note, the movie didn't really scare me as I had thought it would have. Yes, it is completed with scenes that surely have the ability to make you jump, the movie really isn't scary as it's more interesting than horrifying. Exorcisms are a dirty, difficult act as proved by this movie. The equipment, number of people, and the location are all things that all need to be considered in depth. Especially for a person who knows nothing about the work, as in Isabella Rossi whose mother killed three people while an exorcism was being performed on her. Her mother Maria is kept in an institution in Italy to keep her under control from what is suspected of her. As the hospital workers think it is merely insanity, the truth is, Maria is somehow possessed by a demon, and has been for years before. As she explains in the beginning, Isabella has always known something was seriously wrong with her troubled mother but she never exactly understood it until she found out her mother and the three murders, especially becoming concerned after learning that an exorcism was being performed upon her. Any regular person would freak at finding something out about their mother such as this, but Isabella treats it as though it's cancer her mothers going through, not insanity from possession by a demon. Demons in the world is an ongoing topic in the world, yet those who actually do believe in them merely think of them as harmless, not at all raging, killing machines. But aside from all this, the movie (in documentary form) goes on to tell the story of trying to help the mother escape the grasp of this so called demon. Experiencing an exorcism is first up for Maria to prepare to begin helping her mother. Crazy yet on-spot, the first exorcism goes on and on, not really having an outcome of any kind. But not long after this event, as it seems in the movie anyhow, they go to the hospital to try and perform an actual exorcism on Maria. But being against the law for the exorcists to perform such an exorcism, the stakes are high and the two exorcists don't really know what to expect after they finish it. Finding out the true death of the three victims in the first attempt to perform the exorcism is when things really begin to get risky as they find out that they died by the demon within Maria, but not physically. In the end, the violent end that is, it becomes hard to decide whether it was actually a good movie at all, but after a couple days of seeing the movie I've decided that the movie is fairly good, but again, more interesting than scary or even entertaining.",

(more like a recommendation) I recommend leaving as soon as her back bends/breaks in the hospital and then just imagine a scary ending as you're leaving the theater. Then the movie would be fantastic. The ending just ruined everything in my opinion.SPOILER! I didn't like when the priest killed himself, I thought it was extremely disturbing, and I live and breath horror films, it just looked too real, which is the point but it rubbed me the wrong way. Could have been a fantastic movie, the ending just ruined it all.",

A female acquaintance of mine wished to see this so badly that we skipped \"Red Tails,\" at the City Walk AMC in Orlando Florida's (ultra comfortable) Universal Studio's Theme Park Theater.First off, most of what you see in the trailers and on the posters aren't really storyline characters but people and places viewed briefly in passing. (You will see what I mean, particularly one MAJOR let down here) ***If you enjoy the fictitious documentary-styled thrillers like the \"Blair Witch Project,\" or \"Paranormal Activity,\" then this is the kind of movie for you.*** If you prefer well researched story plots; like a film where priests say things that real priests would say to create a form of semi-real feeling (a la \"The Rite\" or \"the Exorcist\"), and not completely speak non-existent Bible verses/indoctrinations and such, then this is NOT the film for you.If you have feelings of expected excitement from previews, lower your expectations some before going in the door (or buy something worth the $10 and skip the door altogether, *my suggestion*).It is an okay film; I promise no awards here, and if you make it past the first 30 minutes, you'll probably stay through to the end (for whatever that is worth). Most of the special effects are pretty good, some lack of attention was obvious by those editing the film (see how many screw-ups you can pick out! That will add to the entertainment factor). There were decent cuts and this whole \"reality t.v.\" feel to the movie (a la \"Real World,\" or \"Jersey Shore\" with between scene personal commentaries on developing scenarios).All in all the film feels incomplete and will most likely leave you with a ton of questions at the end. I can't see paying to watch a sequel, if that is what they were setting up for. It also seems that there is the potential possibility that the entire film is nothing more than the shameless promotion of a website, which is given just before closing credits, which for the life of me, I didn't bring any office supplies to the theater, so I couldn't write it down (Bring a pen and pad of paper!). (Not that I would have visited the website anyway... well maybe if I was was bored to tears I suppose).Final words: Not THE WORST movie EVER, but not really a GOOD movie either. B.W.P. and P.A. fans will love it, and if you must see every exorcism film ever, you may like it (Do NOT expect \"Omen,\" \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose,\" or \"the Rite\"), otherwise, it will probably let you down. I didn't enjoy it, but it didn't have me pushing jagged objects through my eyelids, lets put it that way. 2*/5* PS: Don't skip Red Tails!",

The movie is like a mix of the Blair witch, Paranormal Activity and The Exorcist all rolled in to one. More time should of went in to making this movie and with a few changes the movie could of been the best movies since the Exorcist to come out about demon possession!

This film treats the exorcism like a fairground ride, in fact it loves them so much we have at least 3 that I counted including one in a car (JAZZ HANDS!).

I was thinking to myself about what bad film I should rent and watch, while renting other films that I have seen, but haven't reviewed. So I was about to get this and The Apparation, but I rented too much films, and so I got rid of the later one. So with my mindset going on the fact that I wanted to be hilariously bad, I can say that I didn't hate it as much as I did the first time I watched The Devil Inside, but I still thought it's a piece of crap. The good things about the film are that the premise could've been interesting as it's different than what you typically see from an exorcism film, and the acting is decent at best, with some actors being creepy, and some being dull and meh. There are some points that I get why it's being filmed, and that's all I can think of. So let's get this started. Most of the time, I had no idea why it's being filmed, and when you start to realize why later on, you wouldn't care about it because the story that they have in this is uninteresting. The characters are two-dimensional as you see what the characters' role is, and what their motivations are. Other then that, there's no character that you really would root for. The scares in this are not effective, and they don't progress much through the story. There are some silly moments that are suppose to be scary, but come off as unintentionally funny and silly. Now let's talk about the ending, cause that's what the film is well known for. When things finally start to happen in the climax, the movie decided to end so abruptly, and it gives off a link afterwards that supposedly tells us more information, even though it doesn't work since this movie is years old. So I agree that the ending is probably one of the worst that I've seen, but at least it spawn a hilarious reaction video on YouTube. The Devil Inside is a terrible movie that I couldn't say is one of the worst horror films that I've seen after rewatching this, but it was kind of close there.",

            "content": "The Devil Inside is one of those rare horror films (mainly found-footage) that brings absolute nothings new to the table. It relies on the cheap found-footage gimmicks that gets old real fast.\n\nIn 1989, emergency responders received a 9-1-1 call from Maria Rossi (Suzan Crowley) condessing that she had brutally killed three people. Twenty years later, Isabella (Fernanda Andrade), who is her daughter, seeks to understand the truth about what happened that night (um...why?) She travels to the Centrino Hospital for the Criminally Insane in Italy where her mother has been locked away to determine if her mother is mentally ill or possessed by the Devil. When Isabella recuits two young exorcists (Simon Quarterman and Evan Helmuth) to cure her mother using unconventional methods combining both science and religion, they come face-to-face with pure evil in the form of four powerful demons possessing Maria.\n\nThe Devil Inside is one of the most cynical projects in recent memory. It devoids any kind of creativity, originality, and scares. Speaking of scares, it is not remotely scary. It relies of cheap jump-scares with horror film relies nowadays. And that is sad because back then horror films did not relies on them. And yes, it borrows from other horror films such as The Exorcist and Paranormal Activity (which are better films by the way).\n\nAnd no, I really didn't care about any of the characters. They have motivations that are beyond me (in other words stupid). Okay it leaves me some questions: 1) if the methods they are using are illegal, why the exorcists are performing the exorcism(s)? and 2) why the people involve in this agree to do a documentary (if you want to call it that)?\n\nThe most important thing I want to talk is the ending. It is one of the worst endings in recent years. It is an ending so bad that anyone could have come up a better ending than the director, writer, or anyone else in this movie. And adding insult to injury, the credits has to be the slowest credits ever. No wonder it has a \"F\" on CinemaScore.\n\nWhat to say about The Devil Inside? It is one of the worst horror flicks in recent years. It is total waste of time. The Devil Inside was bad that I prefer to be possessed by the Devil for eighty-three straight minutes. I pretty sure that will be more fun than watching this movie.\n\nStay far away from The Devil Inside! Like I said before, it is a total waste of time. I highly recommend you watch the films that this film borrows from: The Exorcist (which is one of the best horror films ever) and Paranormal Activity (although I am not a fan).",

The issue with the acting is the line delivery, enthusiasm is sapped out and almost every serious line is delivered in slow monotone which really does slow the pace down, The Devil Inside feels remarkably long winded despite it running in at only 90 minutes. This film didn't deserve the critical bashing it received, it has some worthy moments and they are the exorcism scenes. Bones crack, blood seeps, eyes invert and strange markings appear on the bodies of the victims, the camerawork here hides behind character shoulders as if it's too scared to go near the possessed and the tightly packed close ups genuinely stir an atmosphere. The performances do actually liven up here at the most critical point, and I thought the scene where Isabella Rossi meets her Mum was pretty tense, I had no clue what she would do, and the \"connect the cuts\" line is weird.

When her daughter gets old enough, she heads to Italy with a camera to see her mother and some priests she hopes can save her mother.  The priests take her on some exorcisms to ensure she understands exactly what she is asking for.  Can the girl handle seeing the exorcisms?\n\n\"Three people are dead.\"\n\nWilliam Brent Bell, director of Sparkle and Charm, Stay Alive, and Wer, delivers The Devil Inside.  The storyline for this picture is fairly straightforward for the exorcism genre with a nice twist of using the paranormal activity filming style.  The exorcism scenes were very well done and the acting is fairly good.  The cast includes Fernanda Andrade, Simon Quarterman, Evan Helmuth, Suzan Crowley, and Bonnie Morgan.\n\n\"He said to say thank you.\"\n\nWe watched the Devil Inside off Neflix the other night when we were in the mood for a horror movie.  We had heard fairly good things about this and decided to give it a shot.  I can say this was fairly interesting and fun to follow but it was average overall and just another horror picture.  Overall, this is worth watching once if you're a fan of the exorcism genre but I wouldn't add it to my DVD collection.\n\n\"Have you ever witnessed a real exorcism Father?\"\n\"Yeah! Right after he saw the Easter Bunny!\"\n\nGrade: C",

            "content": "So lets talk about trends really fast. When something is popular, people imitate it with new execution, and when those things become good, we have a trend. Movies seem to have all sorts of trends whether it be zombie movies, parody movies, the current comic book movie blowout, or whatever. And trends usually happen until people get sick of them, and whatever is the new opposite and contrast to those trends will feel like a breathe of fresh air, and become the new trend. Two of these trends in movies are the possession movies, where a girl gets possessed, and there's exorcisms. (It's always a girl for some reason, they just have to imitate the Exorcist I guess) And there is also the shaky cam cheap budget first person trend, started by Paranormal Activity. And I don't mind trends, or hate movies that follow them, if I did I'd hate a lot of movies. I actually love the first person thing when it's done right. But the Devil Inside combines both of them. It's about a girl's mother who went bat shit crazy and killed a bunch of people really long ago, and the daughter recently found out it was because of an exorcism and is apparently getting so far into it she decides to make a documentary about it. (I think) And that's my first point, the first person thing is so unneeded. The camera guy is hardly ever shown, they make little reference to him being there, and wanting to film this is a complete coincidence. It was a huge excuse that felt unnatural. And he's shaking it at some of the worst times. Not saying the camera was bad all the time, but at least movies like Chronicle and Paranormal Activity make it fun. And to be honest, the first time I watched this I was miserable. Let's just say it was an uncomfortable experience where I had to watch it with a religious person, and I couldn't turn the volume down, and it was awkward. This time, not nearly as bad, I could turn the volume down when the girl tried sucking the priest's dick... yeah, that probably sounded weird if you didn't see the movie. Anyway,  let's talk about all the exorcisms scenes. They were very over the top, but not as much as I thought the first time. Power of volume ladies and gentlemen. They're creepy shit, they give you that little chill up your spine. But yeah, other than a couple of moments like that, this movie has nothing really going for it at all. The characters are the most wooden I've seen in awhile, and even the main chick who feels interesting, her every emotion is random. And it's a horror flick, the characters aren't suppose to hold the movie, but what is holding this movie up? The exorcism scenes. I might have gotten a little edge on my seat, but nothing past that. And at parts the movie gets pretty stupid. The story isn't very good, and the ending is complete shit. Like one of the worst endings I've seen in awhile. And to be honest the first time I watched it I was actually so happy, because it just ended. And the movie had no real substance, and when there's high entertainment value, that's not a problem. But this isn't really entertaining. It's hardly worth a first watch, let alone two. It really just feels like a cheap cash grab, and honestly, that's probably all it is. The actors I don't feel were bad, the dialogue wasn't bad, just the pacing and execution. And to be honest, this movie had some hype, a lot of people were probably disappointed. I mean, the movie is almost treating itself like it's smarter than other possession movies. At one point it's like, \"Science can only go so far, religion at points are the only way.\" But yeah, it was like trying to scare people who were atheists I think with their found footage bullshit, and they completely failed. That or they were trying to stir some religion vs. science commentary that they forgot to follow up on. It's not a good movie by any stretch, but not exactly bad either. I could see somebody going in liking it, but you'd really have to fall for it's bullshit. And nobody is with these movies anymore, another reason why the trend is pretty much dead. In the end, just not a good movie.",

So the mother had the four demons removed from her.... and then what? What happened to her? Then one of the priests have this ongoing fear of being excommunicated, but hadn't they said their work was condemned by the church as it was? Four demons right, so where's the last one?

            "content": "One sentence summary:  The Exorcist descends into a Blair Witch style pseudo-documentary.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n    The opening snippet was from 30oct1989 detailing a 911 call.  The caller, Maria Rossi, claims to have killed three people.\n    We jump the shark immediately thereafter.  The next part of the film is 'found footage' or whatever nice phrase one uses to describe Blair Witch style worse-than-useless camera work.  Someone follows the cops around the crime scene.\n    Priest in the kitchen with the monkey wrench to the head.  Nun bludgeoned in the basement with something.  Priest hung in the basement with the rope.  Signs that a chair was used to restrain a subject.\n    The daughter, Isabella Rossi does a film (oi, film within a film) to help Isabella understand what went on with her mother.  This film is not very good either.  It's sort of better than the police mess, but not by that much.\n    The interleaved television station news footage also sucked rocks.  The main part of the narrative (outside experts who are not in Isabella's film) is recorded in a fourth style, which looks quite competent.  The many cuts among these styles makes the film look like a hodge-podge of nonsense circling the bowl after flushing.\n    After being found not guilty by reason of insanity, Maria was committed to the South Hartford State Asylum.  A bit later, Maria is transferred to the Centrino Mental Hospital for the Criminally Insane in Rome, Italy.  This is curious.  One hopes for future exposition of motivation.  Some facts came to Isabella in May of 2009 from her father.  Maria was the restrained subject in the room; the two priests and the nun were performing an exorcism on Maria.  The father died three days later.\n    Eight minutes in.  I hate this movie.  Isabella's film is so badly made it hurts to watch it.\n    Isabella contacts the exorcism school, and they allow her to conduct interviews and to film classes and the like.  Nice of them; of course, they have been doing who knows what to Maria for 20 years.\n    The video of the possessed patients that is shown in the school is of a fifth style, which is the worst of them all: grey on grey, low contrast, small images, iffy sound.\n    The admission to Centrino was described to Isabella's father by the Church as an act of forgiveness.  Perhaps the Church was asking for forgiveness from him for what they did to his wife.\n    Isabella's film traces her route into Centrino, then her discussion with the chief medic, then the first visit with Maria.  Maria is largely non-responsive.  Maria keeps saying connect the cuts for a while.  She does not recognize Isabella or the likelihood of her being her daughter.  She tells Isabella that she should not have killed her child, then goes off the deep end.\n    She meets with two of the exorcists, Ben Rawlings and David Keane, and shows them the interviews.  Isabella and the exorcists delve into what's legal and not regarding exorcisms post 1999, when the Church changed the rules on the subject.  They convince Isabella and crew to witness one of their off-the-books exorcisms.\n    That involved quite a performance by Bonnie Morgan.\n    Isabella, Keane, and Rawlings discuss what, if anything, they can do for Isabella's mother Maria.\n    They finagle getting into Centrino and seeing Maria semi-privately with Maria in a highly medicated state.  Maria goes to sleep on them, which is a sign that they are barking up the wrong tree.  The Maria goes off on them, screaming with eyes widely dilated, and then proceeding to say all sorts of nasty things, in German and English.\n    The hospital staff intervene.  No surprise there.\n    They consider options; they could approach the Church with the new video, or they could use Doctor Costa's recommendation might get a transfer back to the States.\n    Things start to fall apart toward the end.  The camera man, the exorcists, and Isabella are all upset and on edge.  The Church is investigating the incident at Centrino, for one thing, and Michael is feeling massively unappreciated.  David nearly drowns a baby that he was baptizing.  Things get worse after that.\n\n---------Scores---------\n\n\n    Cinematography: 0/10  Uses many styles, most of which are terrible to look at.\n\n    Sound: 6/10 Uneven.\n\n    Acting: 8/10 The actors are fairly good at faking documentary style. The contortionist Bonnie Morgan was impressive as Rosa Sorlini.\n\n    Screenplay: 8/10 Reasonably good for clear narrative and exposition of motivations. I would have rated this four stars if the camera work had been competent.",

However, the trailer of 'The Devil Inside' was definitely creepy so I was hoping for an entire movie of scares while setting aside the predicted corniness and thin story line. With this movie, though, if you've seen the trailer then you've seen the only exciting and scary parts in the whole thing. Seriously. Because of its documentary-style format there was a lot of downtime between exorcist scenes and so the viewer hopes for some scares after watching people you don't like doing Jersey Shore style confessionals that are ultimately cheesy and, frankly, hilarious. I'm a huge movie buff in general so I don't mind downtime in movies and I don't have to be entertained the entire time to keep my attention. But 'The Devil Inside' rarely kept my attention as I found myself mouthing the words I had heard over and over in the trailers. Then there's the ending. I understand their reasoning for having it end abruptly because it's an attempt to convince the viewers that they never got to finish the \"documentary\" because other circumstances got in the way. That being said, it was too abrupt as I was expecting some big finale that they seemed to be working up to that might've saved it a little more. But nothing really came in and saved the movie. Not even the turn of events that happen to the main four characters towards the end could save it. The reason that I gave it a four as opposed to a one or two was because had I not seen the trailers then I would've found it scary. So my advice would be to skip the theatre and wait to rent it when it comes out on DVD. Watch it with someone unfamiliar with the movie and see their reactions - cause thanks to the extended advertising the movie ends up being a waste of time.",

For the first half an hour it did not happen anything (and for a short film that is serious), then when it began the second half with the possessed did not do anything to fear. And then when the actors were very woody, especially in fake documentaries, must be good and make you partaker of their emotions. The only actress that I think you save is one that has played Maria Rossi. Then the ending was the worst blow of all! I never expected such a thing. This meant that they had more ideas towards the end and this thing has angered me and many of those who were in the room.

Unfortunately, this movie was just BAD. \"The Devil Inside\" was nothing short of a boring, fake documentary about demonic possession with little to no thrills or scares. It's pretty sad when the scariest part of a \"horror\" movie is a dog barking (literally the only time I jumped during the whole film). This piece of plagiarized garbage attempts to cloak itself as a documentary, but really falls short and delivers its audience less of a supernatural thriller and more of \"priests\" and \"professionals\" vaguely speaking about the topic. The first possession scene doesn't even happen until more than halfway through the movie, and it is lackluster at best. Complete with contortionist-like movements, absurd cursing, and speaking in demonic tongues, this movie's possession scenes aren't anything we haven't seen countless times before. The film ends abruptly and with no real conclusion, leaving the viewer puzzled and more than a little disappointed.",

The movie even opens so questions that you expect to be answered, only to be disappointed that they are barely covered before the end. Oh and the ending, it was too predictable. Fancy in its own way, but pretty much the same crap from recent horror films. The people in the room were pissed, and so was I that I spent hard earned money on a spin-off of Paranormal Activity.

With the classic The Exorcists being the golden bar of devil movies, I have seen most every other exorcist related movies.  I would put this movie (Devil Inside) at number 2 behind \"the Exorcist.\"  It is better than the Last Exorcism, much better than are the sequels  (Prequels) to the Exorcist, better than Exorcisim of Emily Rose, and most recently The Rite.  The movie stars slow and feeds the viewer in morsels until the awesome climax toward the end.  The characters are likable with the exception of the camera guy.  Good acting performance from all.  There were several scenes that made me squirm in my seat.  Many disturbing scenes.  This is the type of movie where you will be glad to live with someone you trust and not alone.  It is one of those movies that will stay with you.  My guess is the negative reviews are from some people who are anti-Judeo Christian or anti-Catholicism.

I'll admit my curiosity got the better of me and I must say, I should have listened. This movie is a serious waste of time and if you too are curious to see what all the fuss is about, don't. Do not waste your time with this movie, watch another movie or go outside. Hell, watching paint dry would be a better use of your time than to subject yourself to this. I don't even know where to begin. This is pretty much a combination between The Exorcist and Paranormal activity as well as a few other titles in that mix. There is nothing new that you haven't seen before which makes the movie seem even more pointless and an even bigger waste of your time. Not only that, but it's just downright boring(and that's the least of the problems). There's only really one or two creepy moments and they're in the condensed 2 minute trailer which to me, is a better and more enjoyable experience. Characterization is pretty much non existent so I didn't really care at all what happened to these people. The plot and story are paper thin. The whole story is just Isabella (Fernanda Andrade) going to Rome to see her mother and then convinces these two priests to perform an exorcism on her. That's it, and I don't care(nor do I entirely believe) that this was based on a true story. I'm sure what happened was probably horrible but that doesn't mean that it'll make a great movie, case point: The Devil Inside. The acting is just okay. It's not bad but, none of it is really effective or memorable. The pacing of the movie is off, it starts off slow then picks up when they perform an exorcist on this girl, then it slows down only to pick up again. However, none of these are the biggest problem. The biggest problem and sin was the ending. It's as if the writers didn't know what to do so they probably decided that, \"eh this is good enough lets just end it.\" It's so abrupt and leaves so many things unresolved, it truly is one of the worst endings in history. However, thank god this movie is mercifully short(clocking in at only 75 minutes) because if I had to endure another 10 or 15 minutes of this **** I would have begged for one of those demons to transfer to me. It would have been a less painful experience to be possessed than sitting through anymore of this abomination. Overall, even though there are one or two creepy moments they're in the trailer, which you're much better off watching. This is a rip-off of pretty much every Poisson movie ever made. There's barely any characterization, story, and plot. The acting is so-so and the ending is horrendously awful, just truly the worst. Somehow this manage to make $100 million worldwide on a budget of only $1 million, so because of this expect to see many more of these types of movies, thanks world. Editions like these into the found footage genre are better left UN-found.",

It is a complete waste of time and money. For those of you who have, I'm sorry you had to sit through that piece of garbage.If any of you spent money and saw \"The House of the Dead\", you'll know what I mean. Literally, I cannot get back that 1 hour and 20 minutes and the money I spent on admission and concession. The movie is a 'found' docu-drama which is movie medium too prolific for its own good. It movie tries to be \"The Blair Witch Project\" and epically fails to live up to that standard. The blatant plagarism of a scene from \"Paranormal Activity\" should have been a big warning sign this wasn't going to be good. You figure out the end-plot 5 minutes in at 'Exorcism School' which is transference of multiple possession; the big scare is a dog jumping at a fence at the characters going to their first exorcism; the shocking part is the baby drowing scene by a priest; the gross-out scene is a woman having her 'period' during an exorcisim; and the people who end up possessed or dead you really don't care for - they are either dumb (Michael), egotistical (Ben), forgettable (Isabella), or just plain sad (David). Oh yeah, SPOILER ALERT, but WHO CARES it is in the title! It ends with the demon claiming to be the Devil himself and then the movie ends in a car crash.

WhatIsabella travels to Italy along with a documentary filmmaker hoping that together they can unravel the mystery behind her mother's failed exorcism, which resulted in the deaths of three clergymen in the basement of her childhood home. What they discover will be more shocking than anything they could have imagined as they enlist the help of two newly-ordained exorcists to help free her mother from demonic possession. THE DEVIL INSIDE exacerbates an already unlikely scenario using the popular \"found footage\" technique, which works as a disadvantage just as much as it aids in the realism on screen. It is difficult to accept that the governing bodies in the hospitals and churches would allow a cameraman to enter, let alone the fact that he would jeopardize his well-being for the sake of the film. The style does produce some truly unnerving moments, however, particularly in the disturbing basement exorcism in which contortionist Pixie Le Knot performs several gut-wrenching maneuvers. The story quickly loses focus and asks way too much of its audience as we near the final third of the film, at which point it becomes entirely unbelievable. The filmmakers then have the audacity to hock the film's website for updates on the case, as if anyone would visit after being left with such a jumbled and inconclusive ending. Momentary shocks are not enough to win over modern audiences, who crave convincing characters and storytelling with their scares.",

Isabella seeks to understand the truth behind the horrific events and to find out if her mother really is possessed.  Attempts to cure Maria using unconventional, Vatican-prohibited exorcism methods go awry, and they discover that Maria is possessed by more than one demon, which will not go quietly.This ever-popular genre of cinema adds to its encyclopedic index a forgettable, lacklustre entry; a clich\u00c3\u00a9 lost amongst the listings of its scarier, more effective supernatural found-footage counterparts, such as The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity.The sheer lameness of The Devil Inside is difficult to overstate.  It is nothing more than a cheap, uneventful production made worse by robotic, unconvincing acting and a blatant lack of effort in creating thrills and chills.Despite some genuinely disturbing scenes where innocent characters become possessed contortionists and an unnerving scene with Maria Rossi (Suzan Crowley) in her room at the Centrino Hospital for the Criminally Insane, The Devil Inside is, quite frankly, boring.Amateur in all its constituent elements \u00e2",

Then, you have to generate a genuine sense of tension and fear for the fate of these characters. None of this happens in 'The Devil Inside'. There are no characters. There is no fear. There is only 80-so-minutes (It felt eternal) of blatantly blasting on the church, exorcism scenes that reek of plagiarism from 'The Exorcist' (what's with all these horny demons?), and flat out unintentionally funny moments.

The film itself is 95% build-up and 5% filler. This film could have been okay at best given it's premise and overused style of filming, but instead it turned out to be a sham. The film seems to be getting a plot point or perhaps a twist, but it just never gets there. The movie just abruptly ends. This infuriated me, as I attempted to understand the plot on so many levels, yet there didn't seem any plot evident. There were no questions answered or any conclusions. The cast are instantly forgettable (if only the movie was). The film just feels like it was made by college students (I should know... I am one) purely to look scary, perhaps it would have benefit from just staying as a mildly interesting trailer. That way, people wouldn't have the misfortune of wasting and hour and a half of their life watching it. Easily one of the worst films I have ever seen.",

Oh god was i wrong. With the most generic and typical plot ever with absolutelt no surprises to be found. With most jumpscares actually being predictable and the acting being pretty boring really, no real effort made by actors to make it same scary. There is also no suspense and worst of all the practically is no ending. The ending is literally one of the most frustrating things you could ever see if that isn't the whole film in the first place. Utterly terrible. Pretty sure this was just another one of these found footage cash grabs baring in mind horror is typically the cheapest genre of films to make and the easiest to get a lot of people to see.",

The film draws on so many other sources that it has trouble establishing its own identity.Another film attempting to cash in on the recent handy-cam craze, it is a faux-documentary that follows a woman trying to discover what went wrong in her mother's exorcism 20 years prior, which resulted in the deaths of three people and a life-long spell for her mother in an insane asylum.A fairly unoriginal, but decent enough premise. The film does actually make some interesting commentary on the bureaucracy of the Catholic Church, and contains one or two well-timed scares. But the film is let down by clich\u00e9d jump-out-of-your-seat moments that you can see coming from a mile away, like the unexplained orchestral booming noise that occurs whenever the camera looks at something scary, and a ridiculously abrupt ending that stops the film dead in its tracks.If you're gonna go with the whole \"found-footage\" thing, you have to keep it discreet. It's dangerous to show too much, whereas the likes of Blair Witch and Paranormal Activity did mostly suggestion work. Hell, even Cloverfield didn't let you see too much of the monster. The Devil Inside just keeps throwing too much in your face, and it becomes predictable.",

Despite a plot that's prettyI read on the very trusted source of Wikipedia that this movie is considered one of the worst horror movies ever made. While it wasn't necessarily good, The Devil Inside wasn't the huge failure I was expecting. Despite a plot that's pretty difficult to follow, this movie does have some creepy moments. It never actually becomes anything particularly scary, but there are a couple of scenes that can get under your skin. There are two exorcism scenes that are pretty entertaining to watch. The cast works decently well together even if their characters aren't completely fleshed out, but that obviously because of its criminally short running time. I'm not kidding; this movie clocks in at 75 minutes. Another reason for its appalling length is because, strangely enough, the movie ends before the climax. There's no big \"twist\" that seems to pop up in every movie nowadays, there's no payoff for any of the conflicts presented in the film, and it ends in such an abrupt fashion that I swear, the editor must have accidentally taken the last 20 minutes off of this movie. The sudden and unimaginably anticlimactic ending has garnered so much hate on the internet that it's regarded as one of the worst endings in film history, and to be honest, I can't find a more unsatisfying ending in any movie I've seen. Other than the atrocious ending, there are a lot of conflicts that are dropped partway through the movie without any resolution, which is what makes the plot so difficult to follow. Even the primary conflict is dropped without any closure right after a vaguely interesting and creepy exorcism scene. Even with its poor plot and shockingly bad ending, it's still not the biggest offender of this movie. The Devil Inside is, in one word, boring. Other than those few unsettling scenes, the movie is filled with ramblings of the main characters about demons, exorcisms, and the Catholic church. I know I'm making this sound like The Devil Inside lives up to its title of one of the worst horror movies of all time, but you could do a lot worse than this.",

And when the film is shot using the \"found footage\"Whenever I go to see a horror film I do it with caution. It is a genre that I like, I confess, but it has so much garbage that its really difficult to find a movie that is worthwhile. And when the film is shot using the \"found footage\" technique, I fear the worst. In this specific case, all of my fears were well founded.The film, like many others before and after, focuses on Catholic exorcism and does so, like many other films, in a way that borders the absurd. Without wanting to pull out of gallons that I feel I neither possess nor deserve, let me clarify that I am a Catholic, I go to mass, I even know many priests, deacons and some bishops, so I have a good knowledge about the Church. So I can say that whoever has the minimum knowledge of Catholic rituals knows very well that everything this film shows is **** and worse, **** copied from the famous film \"The Exorcist\". Even some of the priests lines are identical! The difference is that \"The Exorcist\" pays off in other aspects, such as the quality and commitment of everyone involved, the intensity of the scenes, etc. It is a magnificent film and it gives us what this film cannot give: tension, suspense, fear.What is Catholic exorcism? The film takes the subject but does not develop it. Allow me to clarify: exorcism is a sacramental that has to be authorized by a bishop and done by a properly qualified priest, but that is only used as a last resort and when there is medical and psychiatric support, that is, when medicine and psychiatry feel that they can no longer help. You cannot do an exorcism without permission or without the presence of able people, including a doctor, and in fact there is no filming. The film mentions this, and does it well, but then it puts priests in blatant disobedience. I do not know if it would be the case for an excommunication, as one of the characters says, but I am sure that these priests would have been immediately suspended and could even be forbidden from practising priestly duties. Therefore, everything we see in this film is an excuse for a carnival that the film calls exorcism. The story itself and the construction of the characters is highly deficient.The cast doesn't help, but I don't blame the actors. The failure of the film comes, clearly, from a bad script and the bad material given to the cast. Suzan Crowley was the best actress here, with a convincing performance of madness that really works well. The Brazilian Fernanda Andrade can join the list of Brazilian actors who made the leap to the USA but was not particularly happy in this film. Simon Quarterman and Evan Helmuth were mediocre.At a technical level, the film is globally bad. The best was the performance of the stunts, generally anonymous, who brought to life the contortionism and the most violent scenes. It takes elasticity to achieve those, and people who did it here deserve applause. For the rest, we can point out the bad cinematography, in the worst \"found footage\" style, that do not even know how to take advantage of the beauty of the city of Rome. The sets and costumes are monotonous and the soundtrack is not even worth mentioning.",
