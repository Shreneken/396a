            "content": "True to its title, 'The Apparition' arrives almost too quietly in cinemas this week \u2013 though rather than being a marketing gimmick like how the first 'Paranormal Activity' built its cult status, there is a much more straightforward reason why this low-budget B-grade horror flick has come without any fanfare. It is flat out bad, no less than bottom of the barrel stuff, even if you approach it with the kind of lowered standards you typically take to such fly-by-night productions from Joel Silver's Dark Castle Entertainment or Sam Raimi's Ghost House Pictures. Indeed, it is from the former that this first-time feature by writer/director Todd Lincoln hails from, and suffice to say that despite being bestowed the rare honour of shouldering dual responsibilities on this film, it is unlikely that Lincoln will find himself with similar luck soon. His 'Apparition' shows none of the ingenuity or even coherence of Oren Peli's 'Paranormal Activity', one of the few horror classics that he tries to emulate in the course of a muddled and practically nonexistent plot. After setting the scene with a 1970s s\u00e9ance experiment where a group of researchers used their minds to conjure the spirit of a lost colleague back into this world, the film opens with a similar procedure carried out by three amateur parapsychology students - Patrick (Tom Felton), Ben (Sebastian Stan), and Lydia (Julianna Guill). Successful they may have been, their efforts have opened a portal for a spirit to grab Lydia back into the netherworld. Fast forward four years later, and the story picks up with Ben moving into a new house with his current girlfriend Kelly (Ashley Greene). Playing like a teen friendly version of 'Paranormal Activity', strange occurrences start happening around their home, including the obligatory flickering lights, shadows in the dark and moving furniture. Then Lincoln remembers a certain horror movie he watched called 'Dark Water', and the said apparition begins appearing as a black mouldy patch on the ceilings and below the linoleum floors. Further on, Lincoln recalls 'Ju- On' and the apparition turns into a black-skinned long-haired girl moving on all fours. But more frustrating than its derivativeness is how lethargic the whole affair is. Never once do you feel that the threat to Kelly or Ben is real, nor in fact do you care for their predicament. That's partly because Lincoln doesn't know how to build tension even with a brief 75 minutes running time (sans the protracted end credits), and partly because the actors involved look plain uninvolved. And really how do you identify with characters who spout lines as inane as \u2013 \"Our house is too new to be haunted. It has no history.\" \u2013 or the utter obvious like \u2013 \"Your house isn't haunted. You are.\"? It is also too daft to realise its own stupidity, pretending to be much smarter than it really is by reintroducing science into the mix about half an hour before the picture's end with a lot of mambo-jumbo about electromagnetic waves and reversing polarity. In truth, the science in the movie is bullshit, and the more it tries to act intelligent about it, the sillier it comes off. Finally, when it has one of its characters Patrick urgently say that the apparition is some entity even older and more sinister than demons, you know that it is just grabbing at straws to try to reinstate its credibility. The only consolation you get is that its ending is as terrible as you expect it to \u2013 since the rest of movie is already that atrocious, no climax however bad can be considered a copout. No wonder then that 'The Apparition' has emerged like a ghost into theatres, without publicity and without any press previews. It has but one aim \u2013 to lure unsuspecting moviegoers hoping to have a ghost of a scare before 'Paranormal Activity 4' swings around for Halloween - and the only scare it will offer is how shockingly inept it is. Yes, you won't find much of a movie here, just an apparition of several much more superior classics that have come before it.",

            "content": "The Apparition (2012) * (out of 4) The horror film Warner tried to sneak into theaters and hope no one noticed it. Sadly, I noticed it but thankfully it was only a $5 show (which was still a rip). Couple Kelly (Ashley Greene) and Ben (Sebastian Stan) arrive in a new home only to discover strange things happening. Kelly is all confused but apparently Ben recognizes this \"haunting\" due to an experiment he did in college where one of his best friends mysteriously vanished. While watching THE APPARITION my mind started to go back to the mid 90's before SCREAM came along and the horror genre was just delivering some pretty awful movies. This here reminded me of one of them because there's really nothing going right in this picture, which starts with an incredibly boring and unscary pre-credits sequence and sadly things just get worse from here. I'm sure in the writing stages people get an idea, look over it, make changes, take away the bad and add some good. They re-work the process until they come up with a story that they can work with. It really does seem that this film just took the first bad idea and filmed it so that they could get anything in a theater before Halloween. The entire story here is just simply bad, laughable and there were times where I just wanted to walk out on it. The entire situation is something I'll avoid spoiling for those who do decide to see the film but it all adds up to a half-baked idea that never works and the ending is just downright stupid. I'd say the studio should be thankful that no one is watching this or else it would probably be getting some heat. The performances aren't anything to write home about but I enjoyed Greene for the most part. THE APPARITION is obviously trying to follow in the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY foot steps but there's not a single scare to be had here.",

            "review_title": "Entertaining but very generic and unoriginal",
            "content": "A rare horror movie I have ever watched in cinema. The premise and Ashley Greene are the ones that actually attracted me. I thought the tag line of 'You believe, you die' could have become something interesting but unfortunately, it is only touch and go. Ashley Greene is no doubt hot and her acting is not bad. Unfortunately, the movie is somewhat disappointing thanks to its so generic story and short runtime.The good: Ashley sizzles up the screen. The music is surprisingly okay for a horror movie. I like how it does not resort to shocking the audience with cheap jump scenes unlike other movies that are eager to make the audience jump often. Sadly, those are what I like about the movie.The bad: Lots of things for a horror movie. The story is nothing original which is a disappointment. It is very straight-forward with no twist. Just some ghostly events string up together. The runtime is one of the biggest crime. It is only 1 hour and 22 minutes and take away the credit's runtime and you get...nothing much. The story just zip to the ghostly events. Nothing much about the ghostly stuff is said. The climax, I must say, is one of the worst climax I have seen in a horror movie. It is almost anti-climax but I won't spoil anything. It just has no resolution. It is also not that scary nor intense. Acting is okay but fans of Tom Felton and Julianna Guill will be disappointed.Overall: It is barely worth a watch in cinema. I am sure it could be viewed as better when it is released on DVD/Blu-ray. The Apparition is a disappointingly generic low-budget horror movie which is a pity. The cast and the premise should have more potential to be interesting.",

            "review_title": "A Movie the Ads Haven't Been Promising",
            "content": "The ads for \"The Apparition\" tell us it's about how believing in supernatural events can make them real. The finished film, on the other hand, never once says anything about belief or non-belief. There's only a lot of generic talk about summoning some dark, evil force from \"the other side.\" Already, we have a huge problem, namely that people will pay to see a film founded on a premise conjured up by a studio marketing department rather than by the filmmakers. Did they know their movie was being so grossly misrepresented, that the prominent tagline, \"Once you believe, you die,\" does not factor into the storyline as they conceived it? This is the most infuriating display of bait-and-switch advertizing since \"Case 39,\" the long-delayed supernatural thriller about a demonic little girl in the care of Ren\u00e9e Zellweger.But suppose \"The Apparition\" hadn't relied on a deceptive ad campaign, that its actual premise had been used to entice audiences. What then? Not much, I'm afraid. Here is a horror movie so narratively tepid, so stylistically derivative, and so conceptually vague that one wonders if it began with anything resembling a screenplay. It has plenty in the way of atmosphere but virtually nothing in the way of plot, character development, theme, or insight. The thrills, while technically competent, are mediocre at best, all drawn from the likes of other, more original, and in most cases more successful horror films. This means that, nine times out of ten, we can see a scare coming long before it finally arrives. Unfortunately, this level of predictability doesn't extend to the overall story, which doesn't even try to be understandable.We open with Super 8 footage of a paranormal experiment conducted in the 1970s, when a group of people sitting around a table somehow summoned an entity from \"the other side.\" This manifestation, known as The Charles Experiment, was successfully recreated decades later by a group of college students, who had an arsenal of high tech equipment at their disposal. We see their efforts courtesy of their own home video footage; rest assured, the Queasy Cam is utilized, and there's a lot of screaming in the darkness. Flash forward to what I assume is the present day. We meet a young couple, veterinarian-in-training Kelly (Ashley Greene) and tech-company service rep Ben (Sebastian Stan). They begin noticing strange things happening in their new house, such as doors open by themselves without tripping the burglar alarm, lights flickering, mysterious thuds, and large patches of mold growing spontaneously in odd places.And so continue these \"Paranormal Activity\"-inspired events until Kelly discovers Ben's connection to the recreated college experiment, which resulted in the disappearance of one of the participants. It's obvious that some kind of supernatural entity is haunting Kelly and Ben. But what is it exactly? Here enters a British parapsychology student named Patrick (Tom Felton), a geeky typecast whose role is to provide the lead characters \u2013 and vicariously, the audience \u2013 with technobabble explanations of a wild, paranormal nature. The more he explains, the less sense the situation makes; this entity, whatever it is, operates under rules so random and confusing that no potential audience is likely to make heads or tails of it. We know that a doorway to the other side was opened, that it wants to exist in our world, that it lives off of our fears, that it wants to kill people, and that, at least in one instance, it can take the form of the missing participant. But why? What does any of this mean?Yet again, I turn my attention back to \"Paranormal Activity,\" which worked so well because nothing was explained. How is it possible that \"The Apparition\" fails for the exact same reason? The answer is simple: Unlike \"Paranormal Activity,\" which was much more psychologically driven, \"The Apparition\" is completely story driven, and therefore is required to be clear in its intentions. One cannot make a movie on merely an idea. It must first be honed into something comprehensible, something an audience can actually navigate through. Watching this movie is not at all unlike playing a game without knowing what the rules are; as you struggle to make sense of your surroundings, you're open to attacks from the opposing team.The final act, while visually engaging, is a maddening collection of twists and revelations that clarify absolutely nothing. The last scene in particular seems intentionally constructed to make as little sense as possible \u2013 and you should know that the trailer spoils it for you regardless. How could this have become such a mess? What movie did anyone involved believe they were making? It might have helped if the filmmakers had used the plot the ads falsely allude to. \"Paranormal events are a product of the human mind,\" says a small section on the homepage of the film's website, \"and ghosts only exist because we believe in them.\" This is an intriguing idea, and it certainly would have been worth exploring. Apart from not being the film it was advertized to be, \"The Apparition\" is boring, unoriginal, and nonsensical.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",

            "content": "This is a good simple ghost story that the teens can watch. The film starts out with a seance in 1973. It then abruptly switches to the present where a \"scientific seance experiment\" is going to be performed. The crew wires up their heads in order to intensify the energy field for the entity to pass through. Things don't go that well for Patrick (Tom Felton, Draco from \"Harry Potter\") and his crew as something has happened.The film jumps again to Ben (Sebastian Stan) who was part of the experiment and Kelly (Ashley Greene, Alice from \"Twilight\" ) one of the world's worse house sitters. Their house number is \"2812\" which flashes for a moment. It adds up to 13, although we really don't need a premonition of things to come. Like a good ghost story the odd events in the home build up slow until they reach a boiling point at which time my cat jumps on me.I enjoyed the build up. I also liked the way they integrated the \"found footage\" into the film and didn't rely strictly on it. Thank you Todd Lincoln. Ashley Kelly, who was allowed to act in \"Twilight\" gives us a good performance in this one in spite of Sebastian Stan being unconvincing in his part. As the lead actor in this film, his character was written rather shallow, which was the downfall of the film. I didn't like the repeated narration near the end of the film and the ending needed to be tweaked.Makes for a decent film for the sleepover, especially if they are sleeping outside in a tent.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Ashley Greene in bra, panties and a shoulder up shower scene. Minor swearing.",

            "content": "If you are true horror fan you have most likely come to terms with the fact that a \"Great\" horror film is fairly rare nowadays. For the most part in the horror world all we get is remakes, reboots, and sequels. When we finally do get a stand alone movie it is easy to say that it will most likely just be an average movie (especially with ghost movies).I for one am far past expecting horror films to scare me, so I was not very disappointed when I realized \"The Apparition\" was not going to be scary. There isn't really much scary stuff out there that hasn't already been done in some other film, so it is incredibly hard to surprise audiences with good scares. Nothing in this movie is going to really catch you of guard or makes you shiver with fear, but you will most likely be entertained through out.The story is interesting enough, I never really found myself bored or wanting the film to end. It is also very short, which is actually a good thing in this case, since if it would have gone on for much longer I probably would have started to get fairly bored.I see people saying this film is terrible, boring, horrible, etc. I wouldn't really call it any of those things. Its very average, and as long as you go into this expecting that you will not be letdown. It won't be a film you will rush out and suggest to your friends, but it is still entertaining nonetheless and if you find yourself bored on a Friday night this will do a good job of occupying a little over an hour of your time.5/10",

The cinematography is good - and that's about it.What should be a straight-forward plot is jumbled by unnecessary elements and images that seem to be included simply because someone thought they'd 'look cool'.

Apparently, producers haven't cottoned on yet that the general viewing public are sick and tired of these clich\u00e9d, poorly written products, so they keep on churning them out. This one's the work of Dark Castle Entertainment, who first came to light with the remakes of HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL and THIRTEEN GHOSTS at the turn of the century, but whose horror fare has steadily deteriorated ever since.The plotting of THE APPARITION is entirely boring for the most part. It involves an unlikable and self-centred couple who discover their home is haunted by the traditional CGI spook. Cue lots of CGI-augmented scare scenes and not much sense. Ashley Greene and Sebastian Stan make for the most boring, vapid leading characters I've seen for a while in a film, and I was hoping they'd be bumped off by the vengeful spook early on in the proceedings. No such luck.Where THE APPARITION has promise is in its filmed back story, taking place during the 1970s, where a team of university researchers manage to conjure up the spook. Tom Felton (13HRS) is on hand and as a whole this is very interesting stuff, based on documented records. If the whole film had been set in the 1970s and stayed with these characters (a la THE CONJURING) then it might have been more interesting, instead of the usual generic mess.",

I started to not care about what was going on, the characters were a bit annoying and I didn't really care about them one way or another.The film is not scary, it has its thrilling moments but all in all it's just a typical horror film for the new generation which really means its pathetic.I think the film would have been awesome if it had followed the group doing the experiment on getting a ghost to appear, in fact that's what I was thinking I was getting into but instead got a cheap shot at a horror film that left me feeling like I had completely wasted my time.It had some good moments but all in all it's not really worth watching.",

            "content": "The Apparition is an abomination of the horror genre. It tried so hard, but fell smack flat with lacklustre delivery, with a non existent plot and absolutely zero scares. Worst, the studios seem to know of the problems with the film, and put just about every fine moment that the film has onto its trailer, committing the cardinal sin of telling the entire story, and showing the exact ending. All these just to ramp up interest in its premise, before the sham got exposed a few minutes into its short runtime of 82 minutes.Written and directed by first timer Todd Lincoln, it felt as if the filmmaker was totally clueless in knowing how to tell a story, rooting from a single great idea of a premise for the genre, but having undoubtedly little inspiration and creativity in the development of a story from the idea. It teased with the introductory inter-title about an experiment from the 70s, before proceeding to show a film purportedly capturing some glimpses of the said experiment. Fast forward to today, some college students get involved in trying to replicate that 70s experiment, involving the invocation of a spirit, and all goes awry.Before you know it, that narrative thread is left hanging in the hopes that it will create suspense and mystery, and the film went on for the most parts to tell the story of lovebirds Ben (Sebastian Stan) and Kelly (Ashley Greene), in showing just how awesome their lives are, and having to co-habitate in the holiday home of Kelly's parents, in a designer neighbourhood with all but one neighbour. Perfect set up for things that go bump in the night, and before long, we follow the duo trying to make sense of shadows, open doors, moving furniture and the likes, before finally freaking out and looking for answers in the form of Ben's friend Patrick (Tom Felton), who was his buddy in that same college experiment seen earlier in the film.As mentioned, there is absolutely nothing here that will raise your adrenaline level, or make you cower from behind semi-closed eyes. A toddler will probably laugh at the meek attempts to create an atmosphere to scare, and perhaps find Ashley Greene prancing around in her underwear a lot more appealing for those peek-a-boo moments. Pacing is totally off, not helped by Todd Lincoln having no story to tell. Everyone seemed to be sleepwalking in their roles, making it horrendous to sit through with scenes being fairly stand-alone with little links to one another, and the premise right at the beginning, well, was just that, not being exploited fully to keep everything under one coherent narrative.You can sense that Lincoln had probably wanted to tell of a more cerebral story than the usual run of the mill horror flicks, but surely this is way out of his league, and I'm sure many in the audience will appreciate a more direct approach in dishing out the scares. He's got to realize that he's no Kiyoshi Kurosawa as the story tries so hard to become a spiritual peer to the Japanese director's acclaimed film Kairo (which was remade by Hollywood into Pulse), and that one shouldn't bite off more than one can chew.The Apparition makes watching paint dry seem like a roller coaster ride. Avoid it at all costs, unless you want to learn how not to make a film. You have been warned as this stinker sinks right to the bottom of the pile of worst films of the year.",

            "content": "Last night was one of those \"free promo code at Redbox\" nights & so I went to peruse & rent some movie I have never heard of or that I wouldn't be able to watch with anyone else. I love creepy movies but not necessarily \"horror\" movies. I am disappointed in the scary movie genre 98% of the time. The Apparition's opening scenes had me rolling my eyes as usual. The \"raw footage\" was so obviously not raw - top grade film made to look old & grungy and camera angles that would never be taken on a home camcorder. I hate the whole idea that they are applying science to ghosts...like machines & computers could really measure the supernatural and I hate that there's the one guy, Patrick, that knows so much about all of it (How does he know all this stuff?). Then in the introduction of the characters, the music and filming style become so upbeat, slick & polished, the characters so good looking that it feels like a car commercial or something. It's not until the freaky things start happening in the couple's house that the movie becomes unexpectedly good. Even the score becomes original, twisted and melded with the strange things that are happening. The writers get an A+ for coming up with new ways freak you out. I'm so tired of every movie copying all others in timing, the \"boo factor\", score, etc. The use of this strange mold appearing in the house, the variety (& not overuse) of the subtle mysterious happenings (all the doors suddenly being wide open), the weird weird way that *something* knotted Kelly's clothes up and impossibly twisted all of her hangers... I love that there is no real \"bad guy\", no person in a rubber mask playing some stupid monster, but it's this subtle strange, faceless, darkness that is happening. The setting, unusual for a horror movie, is in a modern clean suburban neighborhood. This, on the one hand, loses all the creepiness of an old dilapidated house or terror of a fall wood, but brings the story right into your own plush home. When the couple goes to a hotel and they are followed by the haunting it serves to widen the horror to their whole world. Also what happens in the hotel room was so terrifying to me that tears were coming out of my eyes because of a real life situation I was in (as well as some true stories from friends). The movie is not without its silly Hollywood gimmicks or plot problems,(also having a main character that is so hot that I can't help staring at *her* instead of what's happening, damn you writers/casting people) but this is a good freaky movie if you're in the mood for the adrenaline that comes from being terrified.",

Soon weird things start to happen, things which can only be described as a haunting. Seems like the boyfreind was part of an experiment that went awry. They tried to contact an entity from the other side and succeeded with catastrophic consequences. One of the team was sucked in to the other side. Anyways, now the apparition is out to get the rest of the team, which unfortenatly includes the girlfriend. (I mean what the heck? Why say no to an extra snack) As far as the movie goes its pretty standard haunted house business. But its pretty well done. Jumpscares galore, sure but it does it pretty well. The acting is OK to, fun to see Tom felton again. The effects are sparse but executed well, including spooky shadows and otherwordly noises. SPOILERS! The end reminded me of Kairo, other spirits uses the rift the team created and seem to bring on the end of days! So, I know this movie has taken a lot of crap, but really, how whiny can you get! Its a fun horror flick, no more no less, and i sure recommends it to fans of haunted house movies.",

            "content": "The film starts with supposedly true footage of contact with the paranormal and than moves on to a set piece involving a group of people trying to contact the same entity and the results are disastrous of course. Some years later a generic couple find their themselves and their new house being haunted. At first with noises, and than things moving, lights flickering and than a strange mold finally becoming more aggressive. The setup sounds pretty generic and I'd be lying if I didn't say that it's a muddled piece of genre work at best. The continuity is all over the place to the point of confusion. I wasn't even sure either member of the lead couple were even involved in the experiment for most of the films running time. And speaking of running time it clocks in about 75 mins. without the credits. This normally would lead to believe that things move quickly but it's quite the opposite the film feels a lot longer than it actually is. It plods along systematically with scenes involving a surprising amount of lead up that goes nowhere sadly. The film does manage a few creepy moments and the performances are all fine for the most part but sadly they are limited to a bad script and even less competent direction. Even the visuals seem a bit forced and the most annoying thing about all of this. Is the writers blatant intent to write characters that don't feel the least bit real committing such mind baffling acts as staying in a tent in the backyard after being attacked in the house , running into the woods, staying in this damn house instead of going outside on so many occasions and crawling into a tent during the films somewhat interesting climax amongst others. Also there is a fare amount of ridiculous closeups on Ashley Greene in the shower and one in which she walks around the house lingerie oiled up for no discernible reason. And to add insult to injury lets through in a scene of a dog basically dying of natural causes and falling lightly over to his death on the laundry room floor, que the unintentional laughter. The sad thing is there are some talented people here Ashley Greenes performance is limited due to the script but it's solid, Sebastian Stan has some decent moments as well as Harry Potter's Tom Felton there are some inspired moments in the films creative direction leading me to believe that maybe he should assist someone before moving onto his next project. And most of all there is an idea here buried under all the clich\u00e9d muck that's really kinda cool. And one that a genre film hasn't approached before about releasing an inhuman entity via purgatory and having it breach and infect our reality. Sadly the end execution is a huge failure and we are just left with tidbits of potential surrounded by a sordid cinematic inability to connect the dots. **/5",

They were all so bad that one was left with little hope for the main attraction. My low expectations were spot on.I could go on at length about what is bad in this movie, but it would be too hard to resist simply saying \"everything\". Instead, I will touch on the good points. (1) The lighting was, overall, pretty good and (2) the image was quite clear and sharp; Good camera work. I gave it one star for each, thus 2 out of 10.Nothing in the film seemed believable. From beginning to end, this movie is a waste. The worst part? That time is lost forever, and it could have been better spent doing something more entertaining - like cutting my toenails.",

It's just a montage of scenes from other horror films. A disgusting excuse for a production company to release such an atrocious piece of cinema. A young couple move into a new house, which I have no idea how they could afford, where they start experiencing 'Paranomal Activity'. A 'Ghost' that has a more 'Insidious' agenda compared to the likes of 'Casper'. Rather predictably, it is revealed to have a 'Grudge' against the boyfriend who took part in an experiment to communicate with the afterlife. Turns out the supernatural are no longer 'The Quiet Ones'. Honestly, and I mean this with full sincerity...the only redeeming factor was the occasional scene that gave me 'Goosebumps'. Everything else was an atrocity. Stan (bless him...it's not his fault, much) and Greene had no chemistry whatsoever, no idea why this 'Sinister' 'Poltergeist' wanted to waste their time 'Haunting' this incredibly dull couple. The first act details their daily lives as they shop adventurously in CostCo, to which they debate on purchasing a tent. A tent! A God damn tent!? Should've bought a 'Ouija' board, am I right? The scares are non-existent and most certainly will not make you 'Scream' with fright. The demonic entity seems to bathe in 'The Darkness' to which the scariest action it performs is turning the 'Lights Out', or messing up a girl's wardrobe. Also seems to like growing mould around the house...such an inconvenience, 'Dark Water' would've been more effective. The narrative consists of repeating a chore (taking out the rubbish or installing security cameras), then a \"scare\" and then pretending it's not a ghost even though they know it is...literally loops this structure like it's a 'Ring'. The dialogue is lifeless like a bunch of 'Flatliners' and convincingly has no 'Pulse'. An unforgivable excuse of a horror film that made me both angry and sleepy.",

This movie has virtually no suspense with some lame boo scares that would probably not even scare a child. The culprit's aren't even scary, and it's derivative of others. Think The Grudge, only without the eeriness or the punch. I also hated the lazy set-up, and the lack of background. Why should I care about these two leads? They certainly didn't make me care about them. Ashley Greene is gorgeous, but she seems bored half the time, or unsure on how to portray the role. I quite like Ashley, but she wasn't very good in this one. Sebastian Stan fares a bit better as the love interest, but not by much. He is also fairly boring, and lacks chemistry with Greene. Tom Felton is known as Harry Potter's nemesis, but he sucked donkey balls in this movie. This film also pours on the clich\u00e9s like no tomorrow. I'm so sick of the women throwing her love interest out of the house after a shocking discovery she isn't fond of, even when she's gonna be left ALL ALONE! You're scared to be left alone, why throw him out of the house? Its stuff like that, which irritates me to no end. Overall, if you like teeny bopper horror films with no scares what so ever, very little suspense, stupid plot holes, and annoying characters, you may enjoy this movie.

            "content": "The problem with this movie, I think, is lack of energy or urgency. I never truly felt that the characters were in any sort of danger. The director seemed like he wanted to make some sort of splash within the genre, but due to the writing and poor acting it just sunk. The writing is where the movie really failed. I had absolutely zero idea what was going on. I don't want to write any spoiler, but it seemed that the writers conversations went like this:Writer 1: Hey, I have a great idea for a jump scare. How about ________________________________? Writer 2: That's a great idea! But how does it relate to the central theme or story line? Writer 1: Um...Adding to that, there was really no \"bad guy\" in the movie. Yes, there are ghosts, but there is no 1 central main bad character that the audience can truly root against. I really don't need to go into any detail about the acting, specifically Stan, but I will say that it is without a doubt in my Top 10 worst performances of all time. I could definitely tell that the directors heart was in it and he certainly had a creative idea that he was going for, but unfortunately, \"The Apparition\" will remain a could of/should of/would of.GRADE: D",

The flick itself is categorised under horror and in fact it is a horror but one for the new generation. You know, low on horror itself even as it has a few good moments. It also involved a shower scene with Ashley but being made for youth, nothing is shown. It's all about a ghost appearing at the house were Kelly lives. When it enters her live it do works and the ghost delivers some scary moments (for youth) but overall it's a low ride for the real buffs. Although it never had any boring moments it lacks of real horror. But I can guess that youth will love this. It do has some shots that will remind you of the Paranormal Activity franchise. the acting itself was above mediocre and the score did it's work too. Nicely shot and edited. The best moment is between the 50 minute and a hour, there we have a mixture between Paranormal Activity and the Japanese ghost flicks. Towards the end Tom Felton (Patrick) of Harry Potter fame comes in, do I need to say more, a new school horror. And for the Goth geeks, watch the T-shirts and the posters on the wall.

It's a horror film that doesn't particularly scare or thrill you. Instead it confuses you into staying with it until the end.Sebastian Stan and Ashley Greene are the hero and heroine. They're young and good-looking and do an adequate job at looking scared and good-looking at the same time. Greene is beautiful and from a guy perspective certainly kept me watching. Stan and Tom Felton (of Harry Potter fame) are basically the only other two characters.One star stands on its own for tomandandy's wonderful soundtrack, running throughout the film with a series of bizarre twangs and chords that fit with the peculiar plot of the film.It's a mediocre, vaguely interesting, badly put-together small-scale horror flick.

Kelly (Ashley Greene) and Ben (Sebastian Stan) move into her parent's future retirement home to maintain it and soon start to experience strange occurrences. Before long it is clear there is a malevolent entity in the home and an experiment Ben was involved in may be why. Director Todd Lincoln directs this very familiar tale pretty much by the numbers although, he does achieve some effective scenes early on before the story starts to get more involved and thus sillier and more convoluted. It would have been better off if it stuck with being a routine haunting flick but, once Ben's friend, Patrick (Tom Felton), the author of the experiment, shows up and tries to play ghost-buster, things just fall part with all the Star Trek meets Ghost Hunters mumbo jumbo about rifts and predatory entities from other dimensions. Fortunately the film is barely over 80 minutes so it moves quickly toward it's stale climax and at least leading lady Greene is charming enough to get us to like her character even when she isn't parading around wearing only half her clothes. Now only if she had a much better movie built around her scantily clad heroine, it might have been more of an enjoyable guilty pleasure.",

It takes every single horror clich\u00e9 imaginable and throws it into one of the shortest running theatrical releases in years, because that is all it took for them to cram their un-original and incoherent ideas into this huge marketing ploy. If you've seen the trailer, you saw the entire film without having to give the disgusting greedy studios who released this film your hard earned money. Literally, the entire movie. You see the experiment in the beginning, you see a girl walking around in skimpy clothes which takes up 90% of the movie, then you see the worst ending in cinematic history, which is a girl sitting in a tent getting hands wrapped around her, then just ending. This entirely shows that the studios who were involved in releasing the trailer and the film do not give the slightest bit of crap about their audience. They don't care if the ending is spoiled or if you see the entire film, as long as you came and gave them your money. Do not fall into this disgusting marketing ploy, especially when even the studios don't care about the movie. Further proving how much of a scheme this is is the tag line of the movie, once you believe you die. Yeah, thats not mentioned once the entire film. All it was is a hook to try to drag the audience into the film. They tried to have some sort of premise that a stupid group of teenagers can buy into and go and give them their money. Build up a horrible cast and spit out an underdeveloped script and bam, we have a cash grab, or as I would like to call a horrible cinematic disgrace such as The Apparition.Grade: F-",

Especially because I love horror flicks and you can't enjoy them without knowing you're going to see a lot of same old when it comes to horror. So I don't think my expectations were high going into this film. I was just looking for some mindless fun. Parts of it were decent, they sparingly used the 'actual footage' feel which we all know has just been done and done into utter oblivion. Fortunately we don't get a lot of that. The story starts out okay but it just seems to become such a mess. I think that the creator got over ambitious and too excited to be making a 'real' movie and just let things slip into the realm of stupidity. The two main characters are charismatic enough and yet at the same time you just don't ever relate to them whatsoever. For every positive in the film there is unfortunately two negatives. I don't regret having seen it but it still left me very unsatisfied.Twilight darling Ashley Greene is a very beautiful woman. She is the perfect front woman or scream queen for a horror flick and they use her accordingly. The silhouetted shower scene, the skimpy lingerie, the obligatory cleavage shots...the problem is her character literally looks like a front page model in every shot. Sure she gets some smudges on her face but her make up is always perfect and thick, her hair is always perfectly done and you can't relate to someone who is a doll through the whole thing. Sebastian Stan plays her devoted boyfriend. He is decent and gloomy and brooding and if his character had been given more depth he could have carried the film. The best thing about the movie is that the chemistry between Greene and Stan is actually really good. The two of them have heat which is good! Supporting cast is barely existent, just a few small scenes to set up the plot.I could have called writer and director Todd Lincoln from a mile away. As I was watching this movie I thought to myself both director and writer were very amateur, no experience and for the most part this is the case for Lincoln. This is really his first big screen film and I feel like he rushed every aspect of the movie. They could have even took their time and turned this into a potential series but Lincoln killed any hope with that with one of the worst endings I have ever seen. It wasn't disappointing, stupid, the wrong direction or anything like that...it just ended. He ran out of an idea and needed to end it quick and just wrote a line and it was over. I guess I believe that this isn't a hard genre to entertain its fans and this one was a huge misstep. While it wasn't a colossal disaster, it won't be anything I watch again on purpose. 6/10",

You play with bad forces and they might start to play with you. The story is small and compact, the movie does not explain a lot until the very end (and the explanation is very vague anyway).The setting is actually pretty amazing: Then new residential area lost somewhere almost in the desert is depressing almost as these highways and power grid lines. You feel lost in such neighborhood. Not even cactus can live here. Everything just slowly rots and decays. Something is really bad here in this brand new residential area! The main motives here are the loneliness, depression and isolation. Yes, the movie is very Japanese in this way.I really see no reason why this movie is so hated whereas The Paranormal Activity is admired. In a way these movies are quite similar. There is less shouting here but it actually fits the mood of the monstrous and mostly empty residential project. It is almost similar to the first Poltergeist but where the first Poltergeist has changed the tone from family movie to hysterical scarestorm, this movie keeps to be dark and depressing.I consider this movie to be deeply misunderstood.

But this time it's high tech with all sorts of cameras, equipment and brain wave amplifying headgear. Again, they make contact, hear noises, stuff starts moving and the girl who takes part is sucked into the upper corner of the wall.In the present we meet a young couple, Kelly and Ben, moving into her parents house in Palmdale. She works at a vet's and aspires to become a vet, he installs AV equipment and is one of the guys who took part in the experiment in intro II.The first night there strange things happen. At night suddenly all the doors are opened. They next day the neighbor's dog walks into the house and dies. Kelly discovers that on the spot where the dog died, the floor is rotting. Ben goes into the crawlspace and discovers a whole lot of rot.The next night, suddenly everything in the closet is turned into knots, including the wood hangers. They decide to sleep in a tent outside, but weird stuff keeps happening. All the installed cameras are uninstalled and broken.She kicks him out of the house, but he comes to her rescue when she finds herself locked in a room. They go to a hotel but the strange stuff follows them there too.In the meantime Ben is being contacted by Patrick, another participant in the earlier experiment who warns Ben that he's in danger. They call him and he visits them and tells them that they unleashed some force during their experiment. Since he's the brains of the operation he has a British accent and suggests they perform another experiment to reverse the effects of the first. They do and for a while it seems that the force is contained, or is it? The Apparition is a mellow, short supernatural thriller. Our couple also acts mighty relaxed despite the madness going on around them. There isn't a whole lot of screaming even when they are in serious danger. In fact these two don't have a whole lot to say to each other, but that is normal for Hollywood these days. All action and no talk, or alternatively, a whole lot of screaming and no action- no middle ground. The story itself while nothing original is good and well told. The effects are pretty neat. The force specializes in defying physics and it looks good. But when things get exciting, they should feel exciting, but in this movie they don't. The couple is likable enough, these are kids trying to make it in Palmdale during the crisis, not some obnoxious 1%ers in some rich town during winter. Ashley Greene is gorgeous but her character can be pretty mean to the guy, but that too is standard in movies these days. A bit disappointing was the ending. Odd that the movie poster actually portrays something that happens in the movie. A good effort that could have used a longer script and a more enthusiastic direction.",

However, Martin crucially fails to generate any tension and likewise fumbles the ball when it comes to developing the necessary spooky atmosphere essential to kicking this movie into shuddery first gear. Worst yet, the so-called scary stuff sizes up as pretty generic and ineffectual: Hazy found video footage, bumps in the night, doors opening by themselves, even the by now hopelessly clich\u00e9 pasty-faced lank-haired creepy ghost girl. Ashley Greene and Sebastian Stan make for personable enough leads, but are unable to surmount the trite script and uninspired execution. While both Daniel Pearl's glossy widescreen cinematography and the moody pulsating score by tomandandy are up to par, one knows a horror feature just isn't doing its job properly when more care and thought appears to have been put into the ending credits sequence than the rest of the film.

This one has its share of uneasiness, it just seems a bit too unfocused (the story this time not the camera) in its composition to maintain a sense of adhesive continuity.

One area for which the film is quite hard-pressed to get away from, as has been mentioned, is the extreme brevity to this as it lasts barely an hour long and features a lengthy intro sequence so there's a lot of time spent on an admittedly-important plot-point, but it's a lot of time to use up on something that could've gone towards more terrifying matters here. The rating is another issue since it really takes a lot of the intended threats away where it could've been all the more terrifying if it really would've attacked the couple everywhere or actually did something beyond just appearing behind them menacingly or dragging victims off-screen. With no true on-screen kills yet still boasting some kind of body-count, there's very little threat taken from the main creature and it makes for a pretty light entity. As well, the lone chilling sequence of it attacking one of them in bed and utilizing the sheets on-top to form the impression of what's happening beneath would've had more impact with a bigger rating giving it a more disturbing outcome. Still, there's plenty of attacks throughout that work well, the backstory to the ghost is imposing and it's quick enough to not get boring, so it's good enough but really could've used a lot more to get by.Rated PG-13: Language, Mild Violence and a blocked attempted rape.",

They move into a new house and are looking forward to a life together when unexpectedly, strange things begin to happen. Is it the house that's haunted or is it them? The main flaw this film had was the running time. Clocking in at a little under and hour and twenty minutes \"The Apparition\" felt almost like a flash. The film starts out with footage from a 1970 s\u00e9ance. Then abruptly moves along to the present where a group of college students attempt to connect to the same spirit. The whole opening scene was about 3 minutes. What it seems to me is the film went through a couple rewrites and edits. It seemed like the writer had a main idea but couldn't get the rising and falling action to fall into place. While \"The Apparition\" brought almost nothing new to the table of scares what it does succeed in is its atmosphere and eeriness. A couple scenes were very effective and creepy. The other high point of the film was our \"Final Girl\" Ashley Greene. She heats up the screen with her beautiful looks and acting. Now this wasn't the performance of a lifetime but she does succeed and makes the best out of a weak script.\"The Apparition\" does break through the horror clich\u00e9 barrier and tries to be \"Different\" and succeeds for about 1 scene. The scene in particular was when the couple leaves the house. Most \"Haunted House\" films the people keep saying \"oh its fine its just the weather and blah blah\". \"The Apparition\" breaks that barrier and the couple leaves and goes to hotel (Finally!). There one of the best scenes of the film (In My Opinion) happens. I give \"The Apparition\" a 5 out of 10. While it seems the cons overpower the pros if you just sit back and relax and don't think about the \"technical\" side of it, the film really surprises.",

This is a great horror movie -- straightforward plot, eerie setting, realistic acting, creeping dread, originality, and some genuine scares. The setting itself has been described, by those who bothered, as a new housing development, which, while technically accurate, misses the main point that it is deserted because of the real estate bust, thus would likely remain empty for some years. The long drives past similar developments with power lines not yet fired up, made this for me a freaky setting.Dialog others report as tame and obvious, \"Your house isn't haunted; you are\", I found jarring. Real people are often in denial and I'd be denying the bejeebies out of THIS! The quickly escalating series of e-mail messages from Patrick was effective. And, while the thing in the laundry room was clearly inspired by the Korean Grudge series, it nonetheless got me to stop breathing for a time.A few negatives -- how does Patrick know so much? The science babble was too much. Clearly they did something that unleashed this thing, but they just as clearly had little understanding of what it was they had done. And the death of a pet almost always does me wrong. Just made me feel bad, not scared.At the end, a frightened, near catatonic Kelly meets her end -- unpleasantly.... and where will she go by the way? -- in a sporting goods store! I found this movie scary, appropriately (read: well) acted, with awesome settings that exist still in various parts of the country. I've happily watched it multiple times and will again.

And when it was released to theaters, it was released in about half the number of screens that would qualify it for a \"wide release\" status. Reportedly, this shabby treatment was because the distributor (Warner Brothers) had terminated its association with the independent production company (Dark Castle) that actually made the movie, but I suspect a large part of it was because W.B. had little confidence in the movie. I wouldn't call this movie terrible - it has acceptable production values for a movie that isn't big budget, the acting is okay, and there is a little mood in the background throughout. Unfortunately, most of the movie stays at that little mood feeling instead of trying more often to really spook or scare the audience. After the opening \"shock\" sequence, more than half the movie goes by with nothing really terrifying happening! After that halfway point has passed, there are a few so-so jolts, but nothing really memorable. In fact, the movie has a real deja-vu feeling to it, making you think that you've seen all this before even if you can't remember exactly where you saw it in the first place. Ultimately, the movie is forgettable. It passes the time, but that's about all it does.(P.S. - If you remove the end credits, the movie lasts less than 75 minutes long, further showing that there isn't a lot here.)",

I wish I could start this review out on a positive note, but I simply can't. The Apparition is not a good movie. Other horror movie stinkers this year, such as Chernobyl Diaries and The Possession, at least had an interesting concept. Unfortunately, The Apparition does nothing new or interesting. It's a movie that has been made so many times before and almost every other attempt is superior. With a set up this generic, it has to be very well to be a good movie. The Apparition combines a been-there-done-that plot with cheap scares, cardboard characters, and a climax so anticlimactic, that the average viewer is bound to be more shaken by the fact that they wasted money on such an inept attempt at a chiller.The Apparition takes a jab at the haunted house sub-genre of horror movies and if you couldn't tell by my introduction, it does so clumsily. The story revolves around Ben and Kelly, a generic couple who progressively notice strange happenings in the house they move into. These strange happenings are probably supposed to shock and surprise the viewer, but I'm going to predict they will leave the viewer groaning instead. These poor attempts at scares aren't just unoriginal; they're also down right monotonous. Instead of hiding my eyes in terror, I was fighting to keep them open. I kept crossing my fingers, hoping that something surprising would happen, but deep down, I knew it was a waste to hope for such a silly thing. The Apparition was doomed from the start.The Apparition could have benefited slightly from a skilled director, but instead, we're introduced to first time director Todd Lincoln. Lincoln decides to take the safe route by following his horror movie manual. A movie likes this needs someone who can make something out of the snoretastic premise. Based on the film I sat through, it's obvious that Lincoln is not the man for the job. Boring ideas can be made into good movies. Take The Woman in Black for example. The movie sounds like every ghost story ever made, but thanks to strong direction and absolutely thrilling scares, it kept me entertained despite its very basic premise. If only The Apparition was given the same treatment. The clumsily shot horror dud struggles to stay on its feet throughout its brief 82 minute run time.The pseudo-climactic ending did the film no favors. While I will say it was better than The Devil Inside (which isn't saying much), it was still sloppy and utterly predictable. The ending wasn't scary, and it did nothing to wrap up the nearly nonexistent plot. A plot this shallow shouldn't have this many plot holes, but somehow, The Apparition managed not only to be dull and unoriginal, but also kind of incomplete thanks to a few loose strings. Then again, answering those questions would probably require a longer running time, and 82 minutes is plenty. Even the most devout fans of the genre will have a hard time finding something to like. The Apparition is a sloppily made movie that offers absolutely no surprises. In a year with hits like The Cabin in the Woods and Sinister, there's no reason to waste your money on this. Unless you have a strong desire to waste a portion of your afternoon, keep away from this messy movie.",

Honestly, I thought I would get some type of explanation of apparitions. You know like why and how my missing grandmother could show up our house and just \"be there\". She didn't say anything. She was there, we were frozen staring at her waiting, for what I don't know...we just stared and she gazed back, no emotion on her face but I could \"feel\" she was angry at my mother, really angry. Anyway, she was there, just like she was for real but then she disappeared. She wasn't there, she was there staring, then she wasn't there anymore. The end.It wasn't a dream or a hallucination, we all saw her. Remember, she was missing? Well, her body was eventually found and after some questions we found out that at the time she appeared at our house she was dead or very near to it. Additionally, my grandmother was evil or mad or both....if that makes a difference....Anyway, with the title of this film, I thought I could revisit this experience in my life and at least someone else's vision of what it looks like and perhaps what it means.Well, no - this movie is a lot of special effects...things that I don't even associate with apparitions, poltergeists maybe...The only thing I found intriguing is the concept of energy, electrical or emotional...in it's desire to alter our physical world.

Was the story good?It is alright...the scientific experiments should have been showcased more. However, the concept that the entity is taking people is ridiculous based on the data in the movie itself...maybe the full premise ended up on the cutting room floor...Oh well...view as complete and utter fiction. The actors are NOT appealing so casting sucked. \"Malfoy\" narrating is no Vincent Price.Looking at the movie I thought: What is happening to the descendants of those who killed the Native Americans, the buffalo, and enslaved the Africans not to mention what they did to members of their own families. Have all these souls just gone away? Would they not be some very powerful poltergeists...I would think so. What are they doing now? Now that's a movie/story I would like to see. I would title it \"Pay Back\". I know it's not a paranormal title. I'll have to think about it more...anyway...Watch \"Apparition\" but don't expect to be blown away by this story as it is.",

It co-stars Sebastian Stan (of 'CAPTAIN America' fame) and tells the story of a group of college students experimenting with the supernatural that bring something from the afterlife into our world. The film was made for $17 million (which is a decent sized budget for a movie like this) but abandoned by it's studio (Warner Bros.) in it's marketing. It bombed of course but it's really no less impressive than the usual B ghost films we've been getting like this.The story revolves around a parapsychological experiment supposedly conducted in 1973 called 'The Charles Experiment' in which six people tried to bring the spirit of a deceased man (named Charles Reamer) back into the world through concentration. Several years later four college students attempt to imitate the experiment and use technology to enhance their concentration. They succeed and end up bringing a spirit into the room with them, which snatches one of them, Lydia (Jullianna Guill), and pulls her into the wall. The other three students watch in horror, including Lydia's boyfriend Ben (Stan). The movie flashes forward again when Ben has tried to put the events of the experiment behind him and is now living with a new girlfriend named Kelly (Greene). Soon they begin being haunted by spirits as well, along with the other classmates involved in the experiment, lead by Patrick (Felton).There's absolutely nothing new this film has to offer, in the slightest, but the visuals are cool and the young stars are decent. I like Tom Felton and think it's good to see him doing other things besides playing Draco Malfoy in the 'HARRY POTTER' films. Greene is beautiful and isn't just another pretty face (she does seem to have some acting abilities). Other than the stars and effects to look at the movie doesn't really have anything else going for it. It's not really scary despite it's many attempts to build suspense.

If you believe it is real, it can kill you. It was an interesting theory that really pulled me in for the ride. But it was all a ploy to get my money I guess, because these things just happened to these people whether they believed in it or not. It's similar to so many other horror films we've seen before: someone plays with a ghost/spirit and it latches onto them haunting everyone around them and spreading. We've seen it done before, and we've seen it done better.It's unfortunate that the likes of Ashley Greene, whom I find to be a fine and somewhat underrated actress, Sebastian Stan, and Tom Felton wasted on this snooze fest of a movie.

            "content": "The Apparition opens with a group of six friends performing a little thing called \"The Charles Experiment,\" where they all stare at a picture of a deceased man hoping to revive his spirits if they all stare potently at the image. It was originally attempted in 1973, so these friends decide to be cool or whatever they'd revive the experiment. Cut to present day, with Ashley Greene's Kelly living in a small home with her boyfriend Ben (Sebastian Stan), where paranormal activity begins to occur in the small, secluded little home and strange things such as burn marks on the countertop, an unknown substance on the walls, and very obscure little ghostly things begin to become more and more apparent to the young couple as they realize they may have something haunting them. Could it be the apparition? As I watched The Apparition, in complete boredom and bewilderment, my mind couldn't help but drift into thinking why we can not get more independent filmmakers with more ingenious ideas rather than bottom-of-the-barrel studio flicks that fail to deliver on their promises. Here we are given two attractive actors, whose characters are empty and beyond the degree of uninteresting, and spooky activity that isn't at all spooky. Perhaps if we hadn't seen the Paranormal Activity series before watching The Apparition, maybe we would've enjoyed it more, or would we have been wiser to look past something like this? The $9 million this was lucky to make at the box office must have been out of consumer curiosity or simple desperation. It's rare for the public to see horror films in theaters today, much less good ones, so those who sought this out with optimism should've been greatly rewarded with something other than thoughtless drivel. As the film plays out, we feel it's reading from a book titled something like \"How to Make Your Friends Jump.\" Every primary scare is concocted using a high-chord and a sudden jolt in the pacing.But quite possibly the most annoying thing about the film is its appalling lack of ambition or effort. It is methodical, robotic, and redundant, tacking on scares in a late, forgetful fashion like it was so consumed with dry pacing that it forgot what it was building up to. The two leads here do nothing to spark chemistry or likability, so what we are left with are cardboard caricatures wandering aimlessly through the screenplay of clich\u00e9s and loud, abrupt noises. Lastly, even the atmosphere in The Apparition can not hedge it to the level of being passable; it's cheap, wooden, and has an anemic effect on the viewer. This is one of the several horror efforts in the last few years that seems consumed by the banality of its ideas (or lack thereof) that it gives up a third of the way through.NOTE: It's also pretty apparent that Warner Bros. made almost no marketing campaign for The Apparition, and shoved it into theaters at the end of August (like January, which is where the usually mediocre, unassuming films come out) where it was met with pitiful profits and a critical/social backlash. To put that in the perspective of someone who isn't as \"cinema savvy,\" that would be like Apple releasing the iPad 3, promoting nothing, and repackaging the iPad 2 in shinier, glossier box.Starring: Ashley Greene and Sebastian Stan.

It's a PG-13 \"horror\" movie, with not enough to offer and so much left to be desiredConsidering the plot is nearly missing, I'll just start off by telling you not to go into this movie expecting to have the scares explained. This pretty much no real reason for what's going on. I'm assuming the \"ghost\" is seeking revenge on the people that summoned it in the beginning.The visuals look oddly washed even in high def, including dreary colors and excessively repetitive location choices. I could barely tell who's house was which.Ashley Greene shows a lot of potential in as Alice in the Twilight series. But, in this movie, her emotional range is beyond dismal and very forced from the get go. Can't help but think she was even more confused for being in the movie, than I was by watching it. The redeeming factor in the movie, acted out by Tom Felton, as lead paranormal investigator Patrick. But even he was bogged down by a frustratingly spare and corny script.All in all, the movie is nearly unwatchable, due to weak acting and an absent minded story. I would not suggest checking it out at all. 3/10, the three going to Tom Felton for soldiering on through this murky mess.",

Would you really want to watch a terrible movie that is so bad, it has the same rating as the film fifty shades of Grey? No? Then please stop considering, because if you do watch it, you will barely get any scares, let alone entertainment. Although I am usually a bit more positive on low rated movies, this one is not in any way good, and their is no way it is underrated, either. The bad reviews are deserved in this terrible movie, and they should stand strong, because this movie sucks. Here is why.First of all, I would like to point out that looking at a painting is not scary. Even if it is to summon your spirit. I have been trying to summon my dead uncle, and he whacked me across the head and told me he was sleeping. The poor painting in the movie was probably sleeping too. Sad.Also, can I point out that also at the start of the movie, the movie is set when the film The Exorcist w made? 1973? Seems a bit peculiar.I will not spoil anything else now except for what the story is about.Some people in the 70's were having a disco party when suddenly they decided to wake up a ghost, even though he was tired as hell. So, he got furious, and now, in the nowadays, it is haunting others. That sounds original! Round of applause for The Apparition's plot!Oh. Guys. I did not mean it, it's called...you know. Sarcasm. A bit of a joke. You weren't supposed to clap...you were supposed to continue reading my short review.If you are still going to go see it, maybe consider other movies like it. Have a search around in them, and tell me if they look good. If they don't, then my review is a success. You will not go and watch this movie. That is final!

For the second time today, a film with a decent premise which starts out interestingly enough fails to reach it's heights and peters out with a whimper.We start off with some old footage of an experiment where six college fools try to summon a spirit. Well seems (as we find out) they succeeded. Fast-forward to present day in a ridiculous Harry-Potter moment and we witness Patrick (a wasted Felton) and side-kick rushing to a secret basement to....yup...perform the exact same experiment with more fools. Cue ghostly shenanigans and disappearances and the scene is set for the rest of the movie.Only, it isn't really, as we then waste time getting to know Kelly (Greene) and useless hero Ben (Stan) living their mundane lives. Pretty soon weird things start happening around the house and Ben comes to the conclusion that perhaps something is amiss. Does he do the honourable thing and tell his girlfriend? Of course he doesn't! Secretly checking his emails and phone, it seems that Malfoy, I mean Patrick continued with the experiment and unleashed the gates of hell onto our world, our more specifically, just the fools who were involved at any time.And I'll leave the rest for you good folks. Ben is completely unlikable, Kelly just whines, though when Greene's acting is perhaps the best, that says something. Malfoy...I mean Felton is completely wasted and is barely in the film. Surely he can get better gigs than rubbish like this? If you're bored on a rainy Sunday afternoon then check it out, but there are much better films in the genre around.\nThe Sage's Rating: 5/10",

Us review writers can try to be as objective as possible, and still all we can do is give you our own perspective. In order to have your own - you need to watch the film.I have to be honest and say that I did not like this film very much. The story, while pretty good, lacks any bit of originality and is very short on creativity. Its attempt to appear realistic by using references to \"The Charles Experiment\" of 1973, but a quick search reveals that no such experiment ever took place. That, in my book, makes this attempt at \"reality TV\" worst than \"live footage\" films like REC and the original \"Blair Witch\" (and I'm not a fan of this \"live footage\" way of shooting). The screenplay tries to make the audience believe that \"the supernatural\" and \"ghosts\" (or \"apparitions\") can be explained, experienced and even quantified by science. It might work for you, for me it didn't.The way the \"apparition\" manifests itself in the film was quite good I must say. Instead of using makeup and CGI effects to create a scary humanoid figure, Director-Screenwriter Todd Lincoln showed us the ghost's \"footprints\" around the house, and their effect on the living. That was the best part of the film, if you ask me (along with the worthy soundtrack).The worst part for me was Ashley Greene's character. Talk about a spoiled daddy's princess who's so full of herself she thinks she can boss everyone around and call all the shots. Annoying.This film might have been better, but it isn't. The story lacks, and it simply isn't all that scary. It's not objectively \"bad\", simply isn't so good. There are other, far better Ghost Stories that you could spend time on.",

During the experiment, an entity attacks the students and Lydia is gone. Sometime later, Ben has severed contact with the others who took part in the experiment and lives with his girlfriend Kelly (Ashley Greene). Eventually the two start experiencing strange occurrences around their home, and Ben realizes while he's done with the entity, it's not done with him.Released in 2012, The Apparition began development in 2009 as the writing/directing debut of Todd Lincoln. Produced by Joel Silver's Dark Castle Entertainment, The Apparition is very familiar territory for the company that gave us the polished remakes of 13 Ghosts and House on Haunted Hill, as well as original Ips like Gothika and Orphan. When The Apparition was released in the late August dumping ground of 2012, distributor Warner Bros. Gave the film a rather small scale release of only 800 theaters (well below the usual minimum of 2,500 for a new release from a major studio) and flopped both critically and commercially. The Apparition is easily one of the most wrongheaded and ineptly made ghost stories I've ever seen.The problems begin right off the bat with the movie throwing a barrage of information at you. The movie throws the establishment of the Charles Experiment, then as quickly as that's brought up we're introduced to some students trying to replicate the experiment with no establishment of character, situation, or motivation and we're given these overdone effects right out of the gate rather than attempts to establish mood and atmosphere so instead we're treated to jump scares. The \"scientific\" approach to ghosts was a major selling point for the movie's marketing with Tom Felton's character Patrick given prominence in the marketing, but the trailer is a massive lie as Felton and the science stuff is barely even in the movie only coming in at the beginning and the end. The rest of the movie is very tired haunted house tropes that are given the absolute bare minimum in terms of presentation with the shift from the experiment to Ben and Kelley feeling rather disjointed and almost like we're missing transitional scenes. The movie barely clocks in at 70 minutes not counting the 10 minutes of credits and that's a telltale sign the movie probably has major chunks missing from it. The climax is also absolute nonsense with actions happening that contradict established rules and failing to create tension because the filmmakers decided to slap over Tom Felton's narration over the climax undercuts what little tension there is by distracting us with exposition. And even more baffling, the reveal of the entity bears a striking resemblance to the ghosts from mid 2000s J-horror remakes The Grudge and The Ring, hopefully the filmmakers at least blew the cobwebs off.The Apparition is an assembly line ghost story that doesn't even get the bare basics right, there's little effort given to establishment in the opening, the pacing is too fast to establish mood, atmosphere, or horror, and the script and production values are a regurgitated mess. It's just a waste of time for all concerned.",

One thing I always wondered about these types of movies is, why do the characters always have nice homes, do people with not so nice of homes get haunted, I would like to know. Then we move on to the pointless shower scene, every horror movie has to have them, then we see that the ghost was in the shower with her, kinda like the grudge, thats not all this film took from that movie, we'll get to that in a moment. Then she walks around in her under-ware for a couple of minutes. Even though the boyfriend was involved with the experiment, he is completely oblivious. And how he didn't hear that camera fall behind him is unacceptable, thats the scene were the demon picks it up, literally two feet behind him.Man I still have half a page to talk about, but I'm going to cut it down a little. This film pretty much steals things from other paranormal films, there's one scene where the boyfriend is looking down at himself sleeping, they stole that right out of The Unborn. My favourite part is when Kayako makes an appearance, jeessh, what were they thinking. The coolest part of this film was Lydia going into the wall, that is not a spoiler because we know she dies in the opening scene and it doesn't serve any point to the plot, except making the girlfriend mad, but I'm not getting into that. This film had a feeling of hopelessness, kind of like my feeling about this film being worth the 5 dollars I spent. The ending sucks, I wish they would have expanded upon it, very anti-climatic, especially that they show the ending in the trailer, who marketed this film, you don't show the ending in the trailer for crying out-loud.Don't bother with this film, it's generic, not scary, nor is it thrilling or even suspenseful. It tanked at the box office for a reason, it's a joke.",

Yet here I am venting my disappointments at such a lack-luster of a wasted 90 minutes. This really looks like it was directed by a 10 year old fan boy who saw a few movies, scribbled a couple notes of what ''scares'' an audience and did an epic fail of releasing it to an educated public.Every step of the way I could think out-loud exactly what would happen in each scenario. Where's the suspense? The gut-wrenching terror as advertised? Nothing sufficiently adds up as a convincing step towards a darker plot. Am I expected to be scared of mold & grout around the house? Really? ? ? Ashley Greene's character can only be described as MISS ESTROGEN for lack of better words. Without any back and forth character development I was routing for the couple to get butchered before the credits rolled! If anything that would make things slightly forgivable. Just an idiotic piece of cinema to be honest.As for an ending? A total slap in the face, no climax...I've seen adult parody's with better storytelling.",

            "content": "\"The Apparition\" tales the story of a young couple playing house only to find out the terrors hidden in the home as well as their relationship. The film is directed by Todd Lincoln and stars Ashley Greene, Sebastian Stan and Tom Felton. The film actually focuses on the exploration of urban legend and the paranormal as well accenting the freshness of a life anew with relationship and promise. Kelly and Ben are a young couple starting life together just as horrors set upon them. Ben is a collegiate who explores the realms of paranormal experimentation only to have to deal with the nightmare ramifications that ensue. Soon Ben and Kelly battle ghastly forces from beyond the realm of the dead as an entity invades their lives and halts the beginnings of their happy home.For me the film has some serious potential for scares but unfortunately it is as if the director pulled back on most of the scary moments instead of going for broke. Moments when the scenes begin to build to thrilling climaxes the actual luster fades and we are almost pre-warned or backed down from a true terrifying moment. With that said there are some scary moments that make you jump but there could have been so many more. The surreal and ominous atmosphere that is created in this more subdued supernatural horror film is intense and foreboding which give to the story's dark nature. The casual and serious approach to the story casts an almost monotone of mournfulness even when the scene doesn't call for such emotion which sometimes creates a somewhat sleeper moment to the film. The story around the paranormal entity however is intense, dark and sinister which hold most of this movie tightly together and give us our actual active scary moments. \"The Apparition\" didn't completely leave me disappointed but it did slightly frustrate me because I found myself forcing complete interest in the movie as it went along and never felt quite convinced it was a horror movie. It is a film that one could take or leave and never be the lesser for doing so.",

            "content": "One of the most unoriginal and predictable movies of all time, The Apparition should take the form of a Direct-to-Video film. With a very few shocks, predictable events, illogical scenarios and trashy script, The Apparition will make the audience ask for their money back. Though, it had a really good concept, it's just that, the filmmakers wasted the concept on a draft-looking movie. The Apparition might even attract more audiences if it had more familiar faces, mind-bending twist, appropriate location and chilling score.One of the main problems of the film is the failure to scare the audience in an unforgettable way and the illogical manifestation of the apparition in the characters' home in which it look like molds and stains. Also, one of the reasons why audiences can't connect or relate to the story is because of some unexplained events, audiences may ask \"What happened?,\" \"Why did it happen?,\" \"How is that possible.\" Also, the unseen entity which is the title The Apparition, doesn't give audiences the shock factor or the on-the-edge-of-the-sit scenarios for the main reason that it cannot be seen. You see, for an audience to really believe you that a usual thing is scary, you have to provide them something that they can see or an evidence so that they can really judge if a certain thing is scary or frightening, The Apparition didn't deliver that. The whole movie is a question unanswered.",

            "content": "In his college days, Ben, along with his friend Patrick and two other colleagues, took part in a parapsychology experiment called The Charles Experiment where participating members all stared at a figurine/picture/drawing of a deceased man, Charles Reamer, to see if they could make contact. The experiment didn't go so well, however, and a member of the group is killed. A good deal of time passes and Ben is now living with his girlfriend Kelly, but when strange incidents start happening, Ben gets in touch with Patrick, who in turn has been trying to contact Ben warning him that he is in danger. Patrick explains that a malevolent spirit had been released and the young couple, along with Patrick, now have to try and find a way to banish the spirit before it's too late.The Apparition is a movie where if you've seen the trailers then you've pretty much seen the entire film because not much else happens outwith what the trailers show. There's no real character development nor any sort of decent story depth and it just feels rushed. In saying that, however, it would be more painful if it were any longer than the 75+ minutes it already is.To be honest, the film did start off quite well and the story itself isn't all that bad...it's just a pity it's very poorly executed. There's no build up for anything as things start going to pot pretty much from the off and it's basically \"incident...pause...repeat\" all the way through. I've seen good/excellent films that dive right in, BUT the story still allows for depth. You don't get that here.You don't feel any real sympathy for any of the characters either...especially Kelly who is just a royal pain in the backside pretty much all the way through. The reason I gave this film a 3 rating instead of lower was purely due to some of the effects, a couple of somewhat decent creepy moments, and some nice atmosphere.So needless to say this film is not really worth watching, but you never know....you may like it.",

            "content": "It should go without saying, but for anyone who may be prone to pre- judging a movie based on the reviews of so-called experts - please do not pay any attention to them whatsoever.This movie is not without what I could consider to be minor flaws, but as a viewing experience it was exactly what I wanted.The plot was tried and true (and this should not be used as a stick to beat the film with) but with a twist. Without giving anything away, if you're looking for an easy-to-watch, traditional horror movie and prefer a younger cast this will be perfect.The acting, bar one exception, is very good and the two main characters have great chemistry together. The only issue I had with the acting was Tom Felton's performance, which was not very convincing, although it wasn't awful by any means.The progression of how they learn that the house is haunted was done very nicely and at a good pace, and I felt they waited an acceptable amount of time before proclaiming \"it's haunted\". If I was being picky I would have liked for them to hold out a little bit longer and for one of the two to be more skeptical, but it wasn't a big deal as the waited a fair amount of time anyway. My only other complaint with regards to the plot was the decision that the couple take to camp out in their garden for the night. It would have made more sense for them to get a hotel, as they eventually do, or at least call the police.The camera work and overall presentation is good and makes the movie easy to watch. It was shot in a nice location which made for some surprisingly nice scenery. However, the way that they presented the \"found footage\" of the earlier experiments (the more recent two) was quite poor and didn't come across as found footage or naturally pieced together at all. They should have avoided what looked to be unnecessary effects in filming.All in all I enjoyed the movie and would not be averse to seeing it again, which is basically the measuring stick I use to determine whether it was good or not. I chose to give it a 7/10 which outlines the viewing experience and that I considered it more than just decent, but in fact \"good\". To summarize, if you like horrors and aren't a snob when it comes to traditional, tried and tested haunted house story lines then this is a movie that is worth your time and money.",

I haven't seen every movie in 2012 but, out of all the ones I have seen, this certainly ranks as one of the worst. First and foremost, I thought this was supposed to be a horror movie? I've seen high school video projects scarier than this. Heck, I've seen scarier in my toilet. There is nothing, nothing! That's scary about this movie. The only thing that was scary was how something like this was green-lit, especially since it was sitting on the shelf for two years. It should have moved from the shelf to the garbage. It would have saved everyone money and time, including my time. Eighty-three minutes of my life wasted on this horrible film and that's Eighty-Three minutes with credits so this movie is really only 71 minutes. Felt like 171 minutes. So yeah, like I said, this movie wasn't scary at all, and that's only one of its many problems. The next is the acting. The only word to describe the acting is pathetic, the only good performance is by a dog. Yes, a dog gave a better performance than the whole cast. Sadly, he's only in the movie for a few scenes because he dies. After that, this movie goes from just barely watchable to UN-watchable. Everyone else is so wooden, I almost confused them for wooden planks. The only person I recognized in the cast was Tom Felton. Why he agreed to this is beyond me but, I've lost most of my respect for him. Like almost every horror movie, the characters do stupid things that a normal person wouldn't do. Sure they can't move because wherever they move the ghost thing follows them but, I'm pretty sure carrying a bat isn't going to do you any good. The characters are cardboard and one- dimensional. The only good character worth giving a dam is yet again, the dog but like I said, he dies. Lastly, the ending is just as bad as The Devil Inside. The movie just ends because I guess the filmmakers couldn't think of anything else. Who can blame them with this kind of material that's the same as every other paranormal movie. The ending is actually in the trailer, it's the last scene. So really just watch the trailer, you can pretty much predict everything that happens in the movie since it shows all the character's being \"taken\" by the ghost anyways and the ending to the movie itself, rather than subjecting yourself to this movie. Overall, don't even waste your time. This movie would barely pass as a Direct-To-DVD movie, it should have just gone directly in the trash bin where it belongs. The acting is wooden, the story is derivative of almost every other paranormal movie, the dialogue is laughable, and the characters are clich\u00e9d, dumb, and unlikable. The one bright spot is the dog, I hope he has a very successful life ahead of him, as for the rest of the cast, no. Just no.",

The concept is a little on the unusual side (in a good sense) and is played out well. The acting is fine and so is the pacing. It uses some halfway credible sci-fi notions with horror factored in; it's not just some dumb scares. It has a modern neighborhood/Poltergeist vibe to it but that's no sin. Ashley Green carries the lead with no problem. This isn't just some low budget movie with unknown actors; those are the kind of movies that deserve less than a 3 rating. The CGI is not mind blowing but it's serviceable. This movie has a lot going for it and deserves at least a 4 or 5 rating. I like Tom Felton and Ashley Green so I give the movie a few extra points over that. If you like a nice creepy sci-fi horror movie then this will meet your needs. Just don't put your faith in a Faraday cage.",

I have seen some bad horror movies in my time, but about this one i have 10 lines to write about. First of bad plot, i realized they were haunting the couple because the dude participated in the \"second\" s\u00e9ance, but why didn't they backed up the first s\u00e9ance in the movie a bit more. All we know is that they \"opened\" some portal. for the good first half of the movie i thought it was a Tesla ghost haunting the couple. So to sum it up. -hot girls 2 points -special effects 3 points. They did that well -story line 1 point. they could have gone deeper.This movie isn't as horrible as i have seen before, but it is bad.. Don't buy it for the full price for it, rather wait and buy it for $5 at the local movie shack along with 6 other horrors. Slender man has a better story-line with a lower budget.But hey, this horrorflic made me write about it. So that's an A-okay",

Even when her boyfriend was being harmed, she was like, \"meh\". I love a good ghost story, and apart from one or two slightly creepy moments, there was nothing at all scary about it. I'd even started browsing the net on my phone it was so boring. I understand the need for suspense but it can often take too long to build up, and all these two seemed to do was wander around their house in ultra slow motion.

It's bland, like over-chewed gum that's long since lost its flavor.  It's uninspired, incoherent, and overall inept.    The story can't make up its mind who the ghost is, how many ghosts there are, or whether they're ghosts or something else.  There's so much babble standing in for dialog about psychic bomb shelters and spectral beacons that confuses the story rather than clarifying it.  Greene's performance ranges from swimsuit to naughty nightie.    Nothing works in The Apparition.  The actors struggle with their roles, the parts are underwritten, the story is underpopulated, scenes go nowhere, the score is synthetic and intrusive, the editing is too busy, and The Apparition has nothing to say.  The Apparition does not deserve a theatrical release, but should haunt the $5 bins at Wal-Mart for all eternity.",

This movie is sold boldly advertising the movie's very final frame, which was even at the end of the trailer, thus ruining any shock or surprise value their last and biggest card could have possibly held. Outside of that, I'm surprised to see such low ratings here - it's really nowhere near that bad a film. Yeah, it's pretty unsurprising - but on the other hand, the characters aren't written as laughable cardboard cutouts who can't hope to pull off a believable person. The characters here are likeable and genuine, and even though the ending wasn't what I was looking for, the rest of the movie to a lesser degree was sort of what I wanted to see. It doesn't rely on cheap scares or gore to pretend to frighten us - it relies on PG-13, if not cliched, images and suspense tactics that are decent, if not \"seen before\".
