            "content": "Love needs expressions not language, it requires feelings no boundaries, it's beyond oceans beyond limits- Free and Beautiful but only few know how to live it. Barfi as its name is sweet, full of aroma, delicious and tasty. This in true sense expresses love without any language, caste, creed or color \u2013Selfless with heart; an impeccable cinema worth watching with your beloved, friends and family.Barfi ! Essentially is a chapter of life which has numerable good moments to recall, laugh and to love with. Every character is well placed without being dramatic with excellent music, performances, direction and screenplay.Anurag Basu- the director has done extraordinary work in terms of narrating the story. Like 'Inception' his narrative style takes you in flashback and a flashback within a flashback to narrate a simple story in its most impactful form without creating confusions to audience. Every story has been woven perfectly till climax. Despite the destiny of characters what audience recalls some beautiful moments, cheer, laughs, true love and sacrifice. Each and every prank on screen gives you a bucketful humor and feel good factor whether it's Barfi-cop chase or Barfi's effort to impress Jhilmil and Shruti throughout the movie.Ranbir Kapoor- Well this guy has redefined himself, and the only commercial cinema star of recent time who knows how to act dances and laugh with perfection. Whether it was 'wake up sid', 'Raajneeti'or 'Rockstar' with every movie he has successfully set benchmark for himself but with this movie he has set benchmark even for so called Khans and Roshans. The beauty of his character is despite being deaf and dump in the movie not a single moment you will realize that he even require to speak. His expressions are heartwarming and simply outstanding. Priyanka Chopra \u2013 Luckily we have a pool of talented actress these days and Priyanka Chopra with this movie will give a tough challenge to her peers. Her expressions as an autism child are natural and clean. Her feelings for Ranbir as a lady could be easily readable and this is undoubtedly one of the best performances of her career.Ileana D'Cruz \u2013 She is one of the best debut of this year. Extremely good looking and charming, she never gives the feeling of a debutant. She does her job perfectly as a narrator and as an actor.Barfi is a way of life, it has potential to make you laugh without getting dirty, it has power to make you cry without getting dramatic and it has energy to teach you love for all without being a documentary. Barfi is perfect in all sense. And for those who could ask why I have written an inch away from Masterpiece ,well being a critique we always expect more than what we got but as soon as the wedding bells rings in the end it was obvious that Barfi has crossed that inch of perfection\u0085 It's a Masterpiece of Indian Cinema.Thanks & Regards Yours AVA For Complete Review Please VISIT www.thecritiquelab.com Your Views are heartily welcome",

            "content": "India's official entry to the Oscars - Barfi! might as well have been an acronym for: Breathtaking (cinematography), Astounding (acting), Ruthless (breaking of stereotypes about the disabled), Fantastic (music), and Invigorating (feeling in your heart as you leave the theater).This is essentially a love triangle between Barfi (played endearingly by Ranbir Kapoor), a hearing and speech impaired son of a poor chauffeur, Jhilmil (played brilliantly by Priyanka Chopra), an autistic girl almost abandoned by her rich parents, and Shruti the narrator of the tale of love (played convincingly by debutante Illeana De Cruz), the soon to be married tourist visiting Darjeeling along with her parents.The writer and director - Anurag Basu uses non linear storytelling to traverse between 1972, 1978, and 2012 Darjeeling, Calcutta, and little known places of Bengal as they three protagonists try and grapple with Love and its various heart rendering implications to their lives. For a film with hardly any dialogs, 'Barfi!' amazingly manages to say a lot, using a combination of sign language, facial expressions, first person narration, and sometimes simply stunning silences to convey a gamut of emotions.Several sequences stand out for their sheer brilliance, be it Barfi's reaction at Shruti's choice of her fianc\u00e9 (Jishu Sengupta in a small but significant role), Shruti and her mother's (played beautifully by the veteran Roopa Ganguly) exchanges on certain choices in Love, Barfi and Jhilmil's night in the forest illuminated by fireflies, Barfi's cutting off of the lamp posts to test the loyalty of his friends, Jhilmil's fantasy about getting married as she watches a 'Chau Dance' in a village, Daju's (Haradhan in a superb supporting role) tear stricken face as he finally accepts Jhilmil's fate and let's her go, the unfolding of the photograph's at Shruti's house to finally reveal the truth about her entire life, and lastly, the finale. All these, and many more, are sure to be etched as a memory, not in your mind, but rather in your heart.This film shows how one can find happiness in the small things in life, and how disabilities, be in financial, mental, or physical can never really appear as a handicap to an otherwise soaring spirit that does not know how to give up on life. This film reminds us that falling in Love is natural, while staying in Love a decision that must be taken with the heart, rather than the mind. And finally, this is a film that tries, without trying too hard, to help you understand that the language of Love does not necessarily require the wisdom of words.One might argue that certain portions of the film are 'inspired' from other films. For example, certain dialogs between Shruti and her mother might remind you of the Notebook, certain mannerisms of Barfi as he tries his best to escape the bungling cop (played aptly by Saurabh Shukla) cause you to recollect sequences from the films of Charlie Chaplin, while the way Barfi tries to entertain Jhilmil & Shruti remind you of Singing in The Rain and Mr Bean. Yet, Barfi manages to stand on its own for the way it interprets these classic scenes and the logicality of their inclusion in the proceedings.The Hair and Makeup department, however, especially when it tries to show the same actors playing aged characters, is the only one that takes a slight dent. Yet almost everything else manages to come together in unison to more than compensate for this slight glitch. And it does so, at numerous places managing to make you think, smile, cry, and sigh, sometimes all at the same time, and in quick succession.Watch it for the performances (especially that of Ranbir and Priyanka), the vision of the director Anurag Basu and cinematographer Ravi Varman, the terrific score of the music director Pritam Chakravarty, and last but not the least for the innumerable ways in which Love has been expressed between the characters. Trust me - this is the perfect example of art that can forever stay in your heart.",

            "review_title": "Barfi : A visual poetry",
            "content": "I was not actually very keen to watch Barfi. The trailers intrigued me enough to go for it but till the last time I was unsure if it would be any good. And then on a boring Friday I found myself waiting in queue for a 3.05PM show. And I do not regret my decision.Story/Theme: I'm not sure how to tell the story without giving anything. Let me then take the help of IMDb here.Three young people learn that love can neither be defined nor contained by society's norms of normal and abnormal Actually, giving any more would spoil the movie for you.Character Development:Once in a while there comes a movie which consists of characters not stars. But, it takes a master to make his puppets grow in the short span of 2hrs and 33mins and make people feel the change. Barfi is such a movie where you could observe the characters changing with time, maturing, being tolerant to each other with passing time. Though Barfi is the central character of the movie still, Jhilmil, Shruti and Inspector are well crafted and given ample scope to go through changes. Anurag basu gets full marks from me here.Direction: Day by day directors are understanding the value of freedom and Anurag Basu once again proved that. Even though having powerful stars and big banner for his last movie Kites various restrictions took away the artistic freedom from him and we got a flop movie. This time he showed what a master director he is. Look at the character of Barfi. How beautifully its crafted. His mannerisms, gestures, postures all are shot with utmost care. Then take Jhilmil's character. An autistic girl. Who gets tangled in the Barfi's life. They fall in love and discover love in their own way. It had the risk of being a \"Koshish\" anyday. A lucrative trap for making a tearjerker, emotional serious drama but Anurag Basu took the risk of walking on rope here. He subtly showed the pain of the characters through comedy. And there he wins hands down. Then there is Shruti and confused normal person. Who gets lost in the world of few 'abnormal' persons and never survived fully. And, hats off for choosing Saurav Shukla as Inspector. He's a revelation in this movie. Other supporting casts are also good but coming out of theater I bet you would remember only these. And, the subtle touch of live background score...an intelligent touch :)Screenplay: The movie narration does not go in linear motion. We get jump cuts, flashback within flashbacks and stories from different key characters. I don't know if many would appreciate such story telling. Screenplay is neat, dialogs are few and far between. Silence plays a bigger role in this movie. Acting: I'm speechless here. Every actor seemed to be acted in this movie considering this is their last chance to prove themselves. Ranbir proved his level in Rockstar already...but Priyanaka just took reinvented herself. A very strong but sidelined character she played here. The focus was never on her but whenever she got scope she just marveled it. Kudos to her and Kudos to Anurag Basu to show us what Priyanka could do. Barfi for Priyanka is going to be what \"Jab we Met\" is to Kareena. Then, the next gem of the movie is Saurabh Shukla. Another brilliant performance. Ileana as Shruti also did well.Cinematography: The movie is a visual poetry. Every frame is such beautiful that reminded me \"Raavan\" by Santosh Shivan. After a few searches I found out the man behind this poetry and he is Mr. Ravi Varman. Just remember this name. Because if you watch the movie you are obvious to search who was the man behind camera.Songs and background score: Songs are good, specially \"Main Kaya Karoon\". And, nice melodic background score. Best thing is the story does not stop when the songs happen. The songs just help enrich the moment on-screen.Editing: In theater few were complaining about the length of the movie. I on the other hand think its the way it was meant to be. Such movies are best told in slowly, like a poetry. Such that every scene, every dialog leaves mark in your mind. Verdict: Reading this far it might seem its nothing but a romance between two invalids and Anurag Basu emotionally blackmailed you in the movie to love it. But what I've not told you is how much laugh riot it is, how this is even a thriller or how beautiful this movie is. All in all, a movie that gives the pleasure of listening a complete story. A movie to watch with your family. A movie where if you take your girlfriend does not stop saying \"how cute!\"Go, watch Barfi!. Watch the best movie of 2012.",

A simple, heartwarming, emotional & feel-good film, that also offers outstanding performances, brilliant music & fabulous cinematography. Its A Big Winner!'Barfi!' Synopsis: Three young people learn that love can neither be defined nor contained by society's norms of normal and abnormal.The Adventures of 'Barfi!' are extremely enjoyable & heartfelt. Basu's Screenplay is a terrific mix of romance, slap-stick comedy & suspense. Basu's Screenplay never falters & appeals all through. Basu's Direction, on the other-hand, is proficient. Cinematography is outstanding. Editing is sharp. Music by Pritam is brilliant. Amongst the musician's best soundtracks to date. Art Design is proper.Performance-Wise: Ranbir Kapoor is a fearless actor & he presents Barfi superbly. The versatile actor lives the utterly lovable protagonist to the fullest. Amongst Ranbir's Best Performances! Priyanka Chopra is another topper. She plays the easy to love autistic character matchlessly. Ileana D'Cruz does a decent job. Saurabh Shukla is mesmerizing in a strong supporting role. Shukla hasn't been this good in a long, long time! Ashish Vidyarthi does well. Others lend perfect support.On the whole, 'Barfi!' is a Must See.",

            "review_title": "Thoroughly enjoyable fable, light & bubbly...",
            "content": "This is a fable, a beautifully shot, light, airy, bubbly fable. It will make you laugh. A lot. And cry, or mist up, a little. If you're still not a fan of Ranbir, you will walk away as one. And the background songs just don't stop playing in your head. There are some deeper layers, as well. Why is it in India that we cannot take care of our disabled children ? Why do we get threatened by them, so scared of social approbation that we are willing to abandon our own flesh and blood, despite having the means to look after them ? Why is it that playing safe seems to be ingrained in our blood ? In love, 9 times out of 10, we will choose the guy who is rich and doesn't make us cry to the guy who is poor but makes us laugh ? Ranbir, a deaf, mute, has never let this inhibit him. He is always happy and always upto something, not all if it legal, much to the chagrin of the local cop, Saurabh Shukla, who blames him singlehandedly for reducing his waist size from a respectable 52 to a mundane 42. He falls in love with the elite, gorgeous girl, visiting Darjeeling, Ileana. She is engaged to be married to Jishu, a prize catch, the dream of every girl in college. But she has never encountered anyone as free spirited as Ranbir.Ranbir, though, is the son of a lowly driver. Who works for another elite, powerful family. Who have an autistic daughter, Priyanka. Who has been left in an old age home, Muskaan, run by the gentle, ageing, Haradhan Bandhopadhyay. When Priyanka's nana, the man who runs the house with an iron fist, but has a soft corner for his grand daughter, decides to bring her back due to his ill health, the lives of all the characters get affected and change\u0085The photography and the music is so good that I'm out of superlatives here. Am sure tourist traffic to Darjeeling is going to increase and the music of this film will be played many years from now, a rarity in todays world, where songs struggle for a shelf life beyond three months. Am not so sure about the editing. The flashbacks, the talking heads. Not sure they were needed in a story which was reasonably fast paced and as entertaining as this. Its almost become a fad now, to not tell a story linearly\u0085 Ranbir is amazing. Gets every expression just right. Whether his happy face, the ridiculous expressions he uses to make others laugh, his angry 'speech', or his bewildered look when things go wrong, as they have a tendency to do with him. Ileana is stunning in western dresses, early on in the film. She is nice as the adarsh Bengali nari later on, but didn't think much of her older avatar. Undeniably a great actress. Priyanka proves her acting chops once again, conveying her battles with her inner demons appropriatelySpecial praise for Saurabh Shukla. The film would've been flat without his Hardy to Ranbir's Laurel. Or Bhola Raja Sapkota, Ranbir's comrade in arms and translator in chief. Or Rupa Ganguly, Ilena's mother, who understands her daughter's predicament and does what she thinks is best for her. Amongst the moments of the film are the opening credits (set to the song 'Film shuru), the comic chase sequences between Saurabh and Ranbir. The Darjeeling scenes between Ranbir and Ileana \u2013 on the train, or cycle or even the horse. And the scene when Haradhan bawls his eyes out, when the apple of his eye, Priyanka leaves the ashram, is just touching beyond belief.After a long time, a film which doesn't just show perfect, rich, urban people. But people who, despite their imperfections, seem determined to be happy. There is a lesson in there for all of us. More at ww.apurvbollywood.blogspot.com",

            "content": "Barfi is that gem which has the capacity of making blood in your heart rush just like children rush through the school gates at the ring of bell. All you have to do is to open yourself and let it do the magic.It offers everything that is there to take from a pure cinematic experience: real characters, genuine relationships, a simple yet poignant story and a soulful score. It offers much more th an this if you can indulge yourself into it a little more. It has acting that connects you straight with the characters and makes you feel for/with them; each frame is a lyrical composition not only by the presence of colors but through their absence as well, the screenplay is such that it either allows the emotions to be overwhelming or would take you out of the scene (completely depends on the viewer).I can only wish to visit the Darjeeling of 70's as portrayed in the movie and I am sure Basu would not have had any problems filming the Kolkata part of the movie as it is the only city which has majority of its elements from that period still intact (No pun intended). Basu has always been good at using earthly elements in his scenes and he reinforces that here too. The manner in which rain, texture of clouds, stones, bright sun have been used to complement various moods in scenes is just exemplary.What makes this movie a winner is the unending list of scenes which will make you laugh, cry and sometimes do both at the same time. Dialogue through expression and enactment has been integrated so beautifully in the movie that you sometimes forget that you are watching a movie where two of the protagonists are incapable of communicating conventionally. It's a movie which celebrates one of the most prized feelings of each human being: the joy of being loved, through a story of people who could have easily decided not to embrace it. Priyanka is at her uninhibited best and Ileana plays her bit to the tee. Needless to say that no other present day actor could have done justice to the role of Barf!Visit http://imnotafilmcritic.blogspot.in/ for more filmy experiences!",

            "review_title": "Sorry, for me its more a Priyanka's masterpiece than a Ranbir's triumph.",
            "content": "There were two main reasons why I wished to see BARFI after watching his promotional trailers. One it was the Raj Kapoor kind of a silent Chaplin act perfectly done by his talented grandson Ranbir Kapoor and two, the gorgeous Ileana D'Cruz making her debut in a Hindi film posing as a Bengali girl. Hence I entered the theater with these limited expectation of mine and then came out largely satisfied with a pleasant surprise which was not at all expected, quite honestly.The delightful surprise was that contrary to all the praises being showered upon Ranbir Kapoor in so many high star reviews in the media, for me the film was more a milestone achievement of Priyanka Chopra than the over-publicized classy triumph of Ranbir. Undoubtedly Ranbir is there with one of his career best performances as the dumb and deaf boy who falls in love with an autistic girl. But truly speaking, I found the depth missing in his written character throughout the film which resurfaces and touches you deep inside only in the last 20 minutes and not before that.Now basic reason behind this perception of mine is that first of all BARFI has a confusing and less focused script which keeps wandering between comedy and sympathy in an imbalanced manner. Plus the story has many more avoidable angles of greed, murder and mystery which take the focus out of its main theme and you feel distracted. In other words, both before and after intermission it is more like a collage of different comic scenes which get the complete support from its actors, cinematography and background score. So you do enjoy them till they last on the screen but still don't get a collective major impact of the movie in the end as always seen in such ventures having a lovingly emotional conclusion.The soundtrack of the film has been widely appreciated both by the reviewers and listeners. But here too I found the lyrical beauty of the songs much ahead than their melody part, which could have taken them to a different height altogether. So for that matter, it isn't a METRO and I personally feel that one might enjoy the lyrics as mere poetry much more than the songs recorded for some special situations. However I did enjoy the title track and the ghazal on the screen as it made a better impact together in the script.Taking up the most talked about feature of this movie i.e. its performances; I strongly feel that it is a wrongly publicized project giving all the emphasis to only its one lead character, taking the limelight away from all the other deserved candidates in the film. May be its a strategy planned by the makers to sell it as a Ranbir Kapoor movie (which is sure going to get them sure shot buyers and viewers), but for me BARFI is arguably a Priyanka movie much more than a Ranbir Kapoor film. In fact Priyanka surprised me as a shock since I was never expecting such an authentic and touching portrayal of an autistically challenged girl by the lady who has come a long way from an International beauty contest winner model turning into an actress. Her performance in BARFI is undoubtedly her career best till date and I would even like to rate it a step above than Ranbir too because of a basic reason.Ranbir Kapoor in BARFI, as revealed in its promos is simply exceptional and there is no second opinion about that. The boy reminds you of two great masters of their art, Raj Kapoor and Charlie Chaplin with his single act. But his outstanding performance is mainly dependent upon all the comic sequences with which he regularly provides the much needed laughter in the film based on such challenging characters. The viewers enjoy watching him mostly because he is more or less entertaining them with his novel face making techniques, innocent gestures and Chaplin- like sequences. But Priyanka doesn't get that kind of comfort zone in her character and that's what gives her an edge over the more likable act of Ranbir posing as Barfi. Completing the triangle there is another extremely talented girl from the South, Ileana D'Cruz, who straight away announces that she is much ahead than many reputed Hindi film actresses both in the terms of beauty and talent. Supporting the three, there is Saurabh Shukla in his famous form, Rupa Ganguly with her sensitive approach to life and other actors who add their own sparkles to the film with their small but notable acts.Director Anurag Basu once again shows his regained abilities which were simply not there in his KITES. With BARFI he has bounced back strongly hitting a big score but still it cannot be called a clear century from the veteran in my opinion. Continuing with his trademark musicians visible in several scenes, the director has extracted some milestones performances from his lead actors and has made a largely satisfying project which is sure to get appreciation from all corners. However personally I found Anurag at his best only when Ranbir, Priyanka and Illeana get together in the film till its final sequence, which actually is the most impactful part of the movie as I felt.To conclude, BARFI is indisputably one of those few films which do have some exceptional, career best performances given under a fine direction. But it still somehow fails to generate a collective impact on the viewer in the end, missing the target with only a small margin.Yet, there is one message which I always take back home after watching movies made on such differently abled characters\u0085\u0085\u0085and that's giving \"A BIG THANKS\" to the Almighty above, for blessing us with a sound mind existing in a sound complete body. So do watch it and remember to give your own thanks to the One Above as the end credits start rolling.",

This is an unlikely combination, which Doesn't seems like to work in Indian Cinema but things have been changed and great success of Barfi proves that even if the hero and heroine are not stereotypical a good story can lead to utmost success. Barfi is not a perfect movie, it was too long and becomes complicated as we travel back and forth between 1976, 1979 and 2012.

Anyways I know it's a movie and i should not go onto that much dept. So, kudos to Anurag Basu for making and attempting a brave subject matter. Ranbir Kapoor is great as always, though his performance is almost the same as in a movie \"Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani\" with Katrina Kaif \"where he tries to get her affection\". This time he was only mute. Priyanka Chopra did a fine job and looked the part. Ileana D'Cruz is a fresh faced beautiful girl. Standing next to too famous young actors and still getting noticed is a huge achievement. In the end, Barfi maybe long but it's fresh, beautiful and heartening.",

            "content": "Barfi , well its a movie which I had been waiting for long. I perceive Barfi as an academy award winner as it brings out the cinematic excellence and emanates the highest attributes of human creativity. It speaks though its silent. Barfi is effortless , it flows smoothly from overture to crescendo. The comedy is so subtle and full of sweet subterfuges. Its an epitome of innocence. I will not reveal anything about the plot but the plot is superb with very miniature flaws that I would not like to notice in the purview of such momentous acting, editing, background scores and mellifluous songs. The narration in the movie is intriguing and funny as well in a sense that keeps the viewer hooked. Songs are well in place, situational comedy is more than appropriate , nothing seems imposed , every scene seems to have taken its own natural course. The movie is set in Darjeeling way back 1970. Ranbir has exuded his panache with excellent acting. Priyanka actually has evolved with this movie and she is all set to move to next level. The screenplay of the movie is amazing, the events are well woven , the movie flip-flops between past and present and the narration makes it very clear, there is no place where events confuse the viewer. Well as a final verdict I would say that I felt cathartic after watching the movie , I expunged all maturity and I found solace in craziness, the movie exposed me to simplicity of life and helped me to appreciate who I am. Must Watch.",

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Barfi!",
            "content": "Ranbir Kapoor's career is about 5 years old, but he has in recent years been extremely selective about his roles. And this meticulousness perhaps stemmed from his modest Saawariya debut which didn't garner as much acclaim as, say the rest of Bollywood's stars in his generation such as Deepika Padukone, Anushka Sharma, and Ranvir SinghXXX. So while his career may not have started off with a bang, his roles to date have always been roles that make you sit up and take notice. Other than Anjaana Anjaani which also co-starred Priyanka Chopra, his scheming politician in Raajneeti, his bearded salesman in Rocket Singh, and of course, his Rockstar turn, have all been powerhouses, and goes to show he's tops amongst his peers in the industry in constantly reinventing himself and breathing life to the characters he plays.In Barfi!, he challenges himself with the role of a deaf mute, as the titular character whom his parents named after the Murphy Radio set, but for his condition, he only managed something like the title when asked of his name. But he endears himself to the townsfolk with his antics, which has shades of being Tati-esque and Chaplin-ish, and Ranbir does what would be his best impressions and homage to those two great comic greats with his role. But in true Bollywood fashion, writer-director Anurag Basu, like his previous film Kites, are never just steeped in one genre, and Barfi! actually contained two extraordinary romances, with all round great performances undoubtedly with Ranbir stepping up his act. The physical comedy gets balanced with rich emotions, and similar to Rockstar in certain shades, Barfi starts off in very sprightly fashion, before darker emotions come into play. And without the use of his voice, Ranbir has to very much exercise his facial muscles and physical presence, to bring the character to life.And also stepping up is Priyanka Chopra, who is a much better actress than most people would give her credit for. She had shown her versatility in 2 films, playing 12 characters in What's Your Rashee, and up to 7 more challenging ones in 7 Khoon Maaf, but nothing she had done had ever prepare her for this role as Jhilmil, the autistic child in a rich landowning family in Darjeeling. Dropping her usual glamorous self, she tones it really down to play a woman- child afflicted of the condition, and yet making it endearing and very much her own, without going overboard in her portrayal. It's as vividly true as can be, and becomes the fulcrum in which the story revolves around. The role called for some wide-eyed innocence, vulnerability and some fearlessness rolled into one, and she conquered this role quite effortlessly. Her initial pairing with Ranbir Kapoor in Anjaana Anjaani didn't produce the necessary sparks given that both were playing very tired modern roles, but here, both showed why they are currently at the top of their game.And added to the fray as narrator, Barfi's first love and third cog in the Barfi-Jhimil relationship is Bollywood newcomer Ileana D'cruz as Shruti. The first half of the film centered upon Barfi's love for this beauty who had just arrived in town, but lo and behold, in this 70s era, she's already betrothed to someone else, and in Darjeeling to enter into marriage. For what it's worth, societal norms had dictated she see through an arranged marriage rather than to accept Barfi's advances, but bookending this film, is how Fate decided to constantly put them in each other's paths, with fairly different outcomes. But Ileana is not flower vase here, and as if challenged by the other two leads, also had to up the ante in her delivery, making it quite a memorable debut Anurag Basu's story took on more complex proportions to tell a simple tale of romance, and the narrative at points also became like a docu-drama, where key characters in Barfi's life gets interviewed, and forms the narrative when it flashes back to key incidents, told in non- linear style. This works very well, especially when wrapped within, there's a crime mystery that centers around a kidnapping, with three ransoms, and a cliffhanger of sorts that would leave you guessing. It allowed all characters to have screen time to show what they can do, and most would been tickled pink with Barfi's delivery of amusement and fun for the girl of his dreams, before events start to really go south for the titular character. The quality in the production values show, especially with the 70s era that blended CG and production sets quite seamlessly.This heartwarming tale is set to move and touch, because it deals with the notion of choices in life, and how sometimes these choices would have varying repercussions that we will not know their impact, until much later. I can't harp enough on all the actor's delivery, because they are what made Barfi! very much what it was - cute, touching and romantic, all at the same time, with tinges of sadness that depicts what's life. I guarantee the final few scenes in the film will make one's heart ache, because it bordered on selfishness and magnanimity, and surely you wouldn't want to be in anyone's shoes when faced with such a decision. Anurag Basu has a winner in his hands, and that's without resorting to sex or violence, but a healthy dose of charm instead. And Barfi! will charm your socks off. A definite contender amongst the best this year has to offer!",

            "content": "Thanks to multiple rave reviews in this space, elsewhere I finally caught up with \"Barfi\" today.Straight off, the film is an hour too long (yes that's right 60 minutes extra in the era of Attention deficiencies), way too convoluted and seems like a by product of a scatter brain Director/Story writer. And lo and behold in this case the Director and the Writer is one and the same - Anurag Basu.This Basu chap has a none too impressive track record consisting of eminently forgettable stuff like \"Kites\", \"Gangster\", \"Tumsa nahin dekha\", \"Saaya\", \"Kucch to hai\" etc. In \"Barfi\" he lives up to his disastrous track record. Also Anurag Basu is no Chris Nolan to narrate a non linear story spanning multiple time frames with flash backs and flash forwards. He just ends up creating a non elegant maze.Many reviewers have already pointed out the shameless copying Basu has done from movies such as \"The Note Book\", \"Singing in the rain\", \"Cops\", \"Kikujiro\" and of course many Charlie Chaplin movies (most notably \"The Adventurer\" and \"City Lights\"). With so much of mish mash the end result is that an hour and half into the film you feel like you are sitting in a boring and meaningless lecture in your college and clock hands on your watch are refusing to move forward. So when the movie ends you shoot out of the movie theater like a bat out of hell all the while making a mental note to never ever watch any more of Basu's offerings.A word about the acting performances. Ranbir Kapoor puts in a competent performance for sure. Going by the current dismal acting standards of Bollywood, his performance seems award winning (atleast the Filmfare variety). Kapoor's character is set in 70's in small town Darjeeling but his mannerisms and body language are all reminiscent of 90's Bollywood films. Ranbir Kapoor should have borrowed a leaf or two from his grand uncle Shashi Kapoor's 1965 film \"Jab Jab Phool Khile\" where Shashi played the role of a poor boat man in Kashmir who falls for a rich tourist girl, Nanda. Ranbir does not get even 50% of his grand uncle's charisma, innocence and authenticity. Ileana D' Cruz has a stock of 3-4 expressions which she puts on depending upon the severity of the situation. Priyanka Chopra in the role of an autist thinks that performances are all about make up, costume and hair pieces. There is no depth and little subtlety in her performance (spare us the repeated slow blink of eyes please). Chopra is no Sean Penn (\"I am Sam\") or Dustin Hoffman (\"Rainman\"). Neither is Ranbir Kapoor, Tom Hanks (\"Forrest Gump\") or even Sanjeev Kumar (Koshish).Anurag Basu has cast some acclaimed actors such as Akash Khurana, Ashish Vidyarthi and Roopa Ganguly in supporting roles but their roles are so minuscule and uni- dimensional that they fail to add any heft to the finished product.I am going with 1.5 stars out of 5 for Barfi. And these 1.5 stars are for: not having shot the movie in any exotic overseas location, not featuring any rich NRI characters, not having any item number, no offensive toilet humor, no 6 pack abs flaunting hero, no noise masquerading as music. In fact, to be sure there are a couple of songs which stay with you for an hour or two after you are done and dusted with \"Barfi\".All in all, this \"Barfi\" is a stale, rotten sweet from a dubious Halwai which has gone horribly rancid. Take a bite only if you are craving food poisoning.",

But, at the same time it's a lesson in the long-lost art of simple filmmaking without being pretentious. The effort is so genuinely heartwarming that it comes out through the characters in the film. I've been extremely critical of Ranbir Kapoor in the past. Maybe he is dumb, but he can surely act! In Junior Kapoor, we do see glimpses of his grandfather. His goofiness is so bloody infectious. He does not play the sympathy-card, he just lets the film carry him along instead of trying what Bollywood heroes desperately try to do - to carry the film on their shoulders. The character is central, not the hero. One of the very few Hindi films I've seen where the audience connects with the character, and not the hero. Ileana is effortlessly sweet and quite unexpectedly brilliant. Saurabh Shukla delivers a standout and stellar performance. The strength of the film lies in the characterisation - so under-toned, and pitch-perfect to counter-balance the trappings of melodrama. The cinematography is breathtaking and so is the music. The visual imagery adds to the emotional quotient of the film. The earnestness of Anurag Basu does suffer a blow because of the predictability of the plot since the temptation of repetitiveness unwittingly underwhelms the magic created in the first half, and, of course, the disappointing performance of Priyanka Chopra. Instead of under-emoting, she overdoes it. Somehow she goes retard trying to portray an autistic girl. Don't judge this film through the prism of cerebral dissection and critical analysis. For once, listen to your heart, not the critics.",

I was eager to watch it seeing its promos and thought it would be somewhat like Kamal Hassan's \"Sadma\" which is considered an undeserved flop at the box office. Well, in this film too the heroine is portrayed mentally retard, suffering from autism and the hero has hearing and speaking impairment. The story is much complex and emotional, and once the mood sets the film becomes gripping and sweet.The film is commendable for its portrayal of physically disabled people as a part of our society, who can feel and fall in love. Well, the film does borrow much from Charlie Chaplin or a background music from Amelie; but the story-wise the film somewhat works. At the beginning, the narrative is a bit confusing and slow at times. Perhaps after the intermission, the story gets interesting with layers of comical situations, emotions, and laughter. The collage of colors, music, and background set in Darjeeling gives beauty to the film. Ranbir Kapoor as Barfi appears in the screen for most of the time and captivates your attention. But I felt Priyanka's performance as Jhilmil steals the show. If you can forgive its length or a clumsy narrative at times, there is much to enjoy in this film.Rating: 3 stars out of 4",

I couldn't figure out whether it's a love story of three people, a murder mystery or a comic movie. What's more confusing is the way the movie proceeds. It often slips into flashbacks. A razor-sharp editing would've enhanced the film much more. Barfi is a feel-good film but I don't see any reason why it should make its way to the list of Oscar best foreign-language films. The fact that Barfi's copied from various films makes it a pure contender for academic awards. The performances were the icing on the cake. Ranbir Kapoor, obviously takes the cake for a career-defining performance as a deaf-mute-sweet boy. Priyanka Chopra is gradually making it to the top league of actresses. But unlike Rani Mukherjee in Black, she fails to infuse life into her character. For a role with minimal dialogue,Chopra struggles to come up with apt facial expressions and to emote with her eyes. Ileana D'Cruz is strictly okay. Her performance didn't really stand out. She does show great confidence as a debutante and she could go a long way in the future. However, D'Cruz fails to leave an impact as a narrator. Overall, Barfi is a mediocre film. Sanjay Leela Bhansali did a much better job with Black.

Hats off to Anurag Basu for coming up with a very thoughtful story and putting it up in the form of a fantastic movie. The story narration has been the best I have seen in the Indian cinema. Even while the movie goes back and forth in time, there was a great sense of clarity in the story flow and the movie doesn't lose the attention or the interest of the viewer even for a second. The climax does the perfect justice to the entire movie and makes it complete. The music and lyrics fits well to the situations and make it a musical treat. Priyanka Chopra impresses the most with pure acting (she hardly had two or three different dialogs to say), very accurate expressions which showed she had done her homework well (understanding her role of an Autism affected person). She steals the show from Ranbir even with less screen time. The movie constantly added new dimensions to her role from a portrayal of a mentally challenged girl who can also be a loving girl friend and then a jealous wife \u2013 Priyanka does all that so very seamlessly. Ranbir impresses as always. This film goes into his all-time-best movies which also includes Wake Up Sid and Rocket Singh. As an actor, this is the first time he has taken up a challenging role and proves that he is here for some serious business. While a lot of acting is already there in the blood, this kind of role required an extra effort which he does. Illena does good in her first Bollywood movie. She does make a mark within the limited scope that she was provided with.

Positioning of the movie in the director's mind is not very clear. Whether he wanted it to be a good blend of comedy and drama , he has failed to do that.2. As a viewer, \"Barfi\" failed to grab my consistent attention during the whole 2.5 hours. There were several missed opportunities during the movie by the director. This could've been a good blend of comedy and emotions but the emotion part was missed out on several occasions. For example, the character of Jhilmil had lots of potential and so has Priyanka however director failed to provide opportunities to both.3. The background music is monotone throughout the movie irrespective of the demand of the scene. As a result there is quite a cheerful music even on sad occasions.4. The character of Barfi was partially inspired by the great Charlie Chaplin. some of the \"creative\" scenes in the movie are 100% copy from Charlie Chaplin movies.few good points of the movie are the character of \"Shruti\" played beautifully by Ileana in 3 different life stages and some creativity including the way Barfi used to throw his shoes for Jhilmil and shadow play on the wall by Jhilmil and Barfi.If you are planning to watch \"Barfi\" and expecting an extraordinary excellent direction, story, comedy and drama like \"Munna Bhai MBBS\" you will be disappointed.

The simplicity of the story of some not so simple characters is what makes Barfi extraordinary. Barfi says that despite being considered abnormal by society; even the disabled have the normal issues of normal people. They're feelings are normal, they love, they hate and yes, they do laugh.It's present day and the deaf-mute Murphy aka Barfi is breathing his last breaths. There are a few people to see him off including his first love, his current love and a crazy cop who was always after him. Why is this man so important? How did he manage to change lives? That's the story of Barfi.Anurag Basu's film mesmerizes you into Barfi's world from the word go. The initial reels have you glued mainly due to Barfi's entertaining tactics. Not to forget that the screenplay starts on a unique note.There are a number of well executed sequences in the movie. Barfi's intro, the scene's between Barfi and Shruti and between Barfi and Jilmil. A brilliant scene being the scene with Barfi explaining to Shruti on how he realizes they cannot be together and why. A brilliantly directed and enacted sequence.There are minuses. The second half does drag in parts and not to forget the screenplay may confuse a few a bit. The whole murder mystery part also could have been better written.One does have to give it up to Pritam who comes up with a brilliant score. Main Kya Karoon, Aashayein, Phir Le Aaya Dil are soothing and addictive to listen to. Kudos to Anurag Basu for placing the songs so well into the screenplay.Anurag Basu's direction is first rate. He's made a couple of good films in my opinion - Gangster and Life..In a Metro. It was surprising to me that he would make a lighter film. Having said that, this is his best work yet.Priyanka Chopra is excellent here. It's a tough role and she gives an excellent performance. There was much scope for her to over-act but she keeps her act subtle yet effective. Illieana D'Cruz is brilliant. Her role is strong and requires strong talent. She surely leaves her presence felt. Surab Shukla is in form after a long time. The rest of the supporting cast is adequate.Barfi belongs to Ranbir Kapoor. Not a single word was uttered by his character yet you feel he said so much in the movie. Ranbir proves why he's the best actor of his generation and his contemporaries such as Shahid, John, Imran etc need to step their game up if they want to compete with this phenomenal talent. Terrific! Overall, it's a nice sweet film that one won't mind watching again. Highly Recommended!",

But actually so many films have been made saying the same thing..... The triumph of the director of this film lies in making the idea heartrendingly and eyeswettingly believable.....As for those who let practical matters take precedence over matters of emotion---its loneliness for them.....as Ileana D'Cruz finds out.....She is the one who loves the deaf and dumb guy ( played by Ranbir Kapoor ) first , but loses him as she listens to her mother who wants her to marry a rich and normal guy . .......And Ranbir is everything but that....He is the son of a chauffeur who is forever in motion.....forever running and jumping and falling and making faces and dancing---as if all this hyperactivity would make up for his defects....But he has no money or future---and Ileana goes out of his world.... .....only to return years later as she finds out that the call of the heart was stronger than the pull of reality.....But now Ranbir is involved in a complicated case of the kidnapping of an autistic girl ( played by priyanka chopra ) who is now no more....or is she ??Now Ranbir and Ileana have the chance to live life again by getting together . But do their hearts beat together again just like they did 6 years ago ?? Or will somebody play spoiler ?? Go and find out by seeing the movie....The acting honours go to both Ranbir and Priyanka Chopra---it was difficult pulling off the role of a deaf and dumb guy and autistic girl but both pull it off with aplomb.....Priyanka especially is in top form.....The scenery of Darjeeling is well picturised as the story unfolds in convoluted flashbacks ; but the director does manage to tie up the lose ends together as the climax approaches.....the songs too are hummable.....but what remains etched in the mind is the moviemaker's call to follow your heart.....As I walked out of the cinema hall I thought '' All this is stuff of dreams and fantasy . The real world is all about being practical ''......but the dreams wouldn't go--of finding true love ; of living without a care in the world in the arms of your beloved.....Well , I told you these movie makers are dream merchants aren't they....and the director is the master of them all.....Verdict---What a beautiful movie",

The music is dull. The photography is excellent. The best thing about Barfi! is all the actors esp. Ranbir and Saurabh Shukla , but they are not given anything to work with. Anurag, who wrote it as well, appears to have fallen in love with his own story. Roopali Ganguly is impressive in a small role. Watch Nana Patekar in Yugpurush and compare it to Priyanka.",

Suddenly Shruti starts to fall for Barfi but story has a beautiful twist when Jhilmil came in their life. Jhilmil suffered from autism and she belongs to Rich life.

This is certainly better than Sanjay Leela Bhansali's cheap creation 'Black', but this is also more or less on the same lines. I went to see the movie after reading misleading reviews.

            "content": "Anurag Basu's 'Barfi' turns out to be quite the pleasant surprise...in parts. Beautifully filmed in Darjeeling (thank goodness this is not another Bollywood flick set in New York or London), 'Barfi' captures the sheer beauty of the landscape. The sets look wonderful, realistic but at the same time there's a fairy tale quality to it. 'Barfi' also succeeds in depicting that words aren't necessary at all to convey love.Most of the songs could have easily been left out, especially the ones visualized on Barfi. Mainly because they tend to spoonfeed the viewer and perhaps just an instrumental track in those sequences would have been more effective. The instrumental tracks were taken from 'Amelie'. What was the point of the silhouetted street musicians? In addition, a few of the 'comic scenes' (e.g. butt pinching) fall flat while Basu uses plot-twists that have been overused in numerous comedies (for example, the whole kidnap with no malicious intention (which was been witnessed in films like 'Khiladi', 'Andaz Apna Apna', 'Hera Pheri', 'Waqt Hamara Hai' etc) subplot felt out of place). Now Basu, seems to have some potential as a director but he always finds a way to 'ruin' his film from being better than what they are. He does it mainly by ripping off Hollywood flicks. Here he takes various scenes from Charlie Chaplin flicks (executed with poor special effects) and one scene is a line by line copy of a scene from 'The Notebook'. I fail to understand why Basu keeps doing this when it's easily avoidable.There's also another issue regarding a scene with a wedding ceremony. Jhilmil is shown to be a mentally challenged girl (to put it in layman's term, someone who has the mind of a child) and throughout the film she's shown that way while her husband is shown to be a typical adult. So what does marriage mean to Jhilmil? Has she entirely grasped that concept, given that she's still a 'child'.Ranbir Kapoor does a decent job. He carries the role well even though he does tend to overact a couple of times. Debutant Illeana makes a confident entry to films. However, I was particularly surprised by Priyanka Chopra. I used to think of her as an average actress at best but now that has changed as she proves that she can far exceed the level of what she's done before 'Barfi'.It's not a masterpiece but 'Barfi' is entertaining and nice to look at. It's charming to an extent and has that 'feel-good' effect. Basu does deserve credit to an extent but again, he's also the reason why his film hasn't reached its 'full potential'.",

            "content": "Except for Ranbir Kapoor, whose acting is mediocre-as expected of him and his generation of borderline talent-the movie is overrated as expected, menacing and annoyingly boring beyond belief. Any movie with a sentimentality (handicap or a misfortune) however stupid appeals to a certain segment of the audience and gender. But that does not mean the movie is good or Oscar material. In fact, the movie will never make it to the Oscars. The Indian directors and the selection committee, are very naive as to what is an Oscar worthy movie, since they are in their little pond and belief that the industry is big enough to know what they are doing. They just have to watch the Oscar nominations or winners from the past-as simple as that. \"Laggan\" the last movie, touted by the same people and the Media, as one of the greatest Indian movie ever, was a piece of trash, that was sentimental (handicap) theme with 13 demented cretins led by an idiot (an idiot even as a leader of the gang is still a cretin) trying to win a cricket match with a last minute miracle of shoulder disability. The movie itself being demeaning to Indians and the brave servicemen who defend the country. Then again this movie was made by a producer whose IQ is in the range of a cretin and he is a unpatriotic illegal traitor who disguises as film maker.If you compare this movie to \"Ek Tha Tiger/Water Buffalo\" any movie is Oscar worthy! In fact the hero of \"Ek Tha Water buffalo\" would have been perfect to portray the deaf and mute since this maderchod scum is a real life a dumb cretin (heavy lisp, khoja hair transplant, six-pack ab,and dialog delivery that sounds like mating call of sea urchins)The acting? of Priyanka Chopra, is pathetic and unbearable to watch and her mannerisms are irritating (this has no bearing on the real autistic children.) We were told that she is autistic, but where in the terminology? does it say she can't wear makeup and have to bat her eyelids like a chipmunk! The Ileana D'Cruz girl can't act..period. She should take some other vocation (teach autistic children?) and save the industry from disgrace.Few Scenes are funny till the Chopda girl trotters on and then we don't know to whether to cry, cringe or laugh at her heavily googled interpretation of an autistic girl/woman. Here is a good actress-probably the best actress-but not everything she touches is gold or autistic.The cinematography is good as in any Hindi movie and Ranbir's (touted by the same producer to portray Kishore Kumar! in his new movie..this must be another low point in the casting by Basu) flair for trite imitating his grandfather Raj Kapoor, has manifested on more than one occasion and more than one movie. The gene has not skipped a generation-but has stopped at his father Rishi Kapoor. He is one of the most overrated actors..mostly by the virtue of his famous name and he is not even good looking like his grand father or his famous uncles.If this movie is Oscar material, then God Bless the Indian Cinema. God only can save the industry from the likes of Ranbir Kapoor, Ek Tha Tigers and Buffalos and the 3 leading idiots...the Kongs of Bollywood.",

            "content": "His parents named him Murphy, but he always pronounced his name Barfi! (Ranbir Kapoor) and everyone went with it. He was the talk of the town. Even though neither he could speak nor listen. His bitter-sweet relationship two beautiful ladies, Shruti (Ileana D' Cruz) and Jhilmil Chatterjee (Priyanka Chopra) completely changes his life through a set of undesirable events. Shortly, BARFI! is a tale of selfless love that teaches about appreciating life no matter how unpredictable it may be.Still he missed abolishing some flaws in the script which are not much destructive but it feels sad to think of their existence. Barfi's sudden falling for Jhilmil seemed a bit odd, Shruti being so quickly convinced by her mother's (Rupa Ganguly) clich\u00e9d reasoning, too much despair of Barfi after Jhilmil's leaving even though he himself was the main reason for it and many other facts which were a bit hard to digest. But at the end of the day, the flaws can be ignored for the sake of too many bright sides and the presence of feel-good factors in high quantity in the whole.I would like to specially mention the tremendous editing by Akiv Ali. This one's his best work till date as an editor. The back-and-forth narrative is the best thing in the whole movie (Besides Ranbir's act) that catches eye. Ravi Varman's magnificent cinematography is the perfect icing on it.Barfi! is one of the most astonishing works by Pritam as a soundtrack composer. Not a single track is hardly bad and the songs fit perfectly in many situations. \"Phir Le Aaya Dil (Reprise)\", \"Main Kya Karoon\" are the bests of all. Also an awesome background score is composed and perfectly placed in the movie by Pritam. The background scores sounded like they were adopted from some Chaplin masterpieces but still they worked exceptionally perfect.Now comes the best part to be criticized and which I was waiting very eagerly for doing is discussing Ranbir's contribution to Barfi! Previously we have seen a movie called Rockstar which was no doubt good but the fact which is undeniable that Ranbir's more-than-brilliant performance along with Rahman's wondrous compositions saved that movie from being an out-and-out disaster. As I said earlier, the character of Barfi! was the most tough and strong role in the movie but the way Ranbir enacted it, it seemed like a piece of cake to him. Ranbir is blessed with immense talent and versatility and Barfi! is just another example of it. I'm strongly sure that no one at this moment could've carried out this role so brilliantly and flawlessly. Ranbir's expression, communication methods as a deaf and mute boy, body language, charm, simplicity - everything worked in favor for him and he looked absolutely perfect in every shade of his character. I can assure that just like last year, Ranbir will yet again snatch the 'Best Actor' awards from not only critics section but also mainstream section. Everyone with a tough and versatile script desires Ranbir Kapoor nowadays and I can clearly see why. He is the best! Priyanka Chopra is also a great example of versatility. Fashion's Meghna, Aitraaz's Sonia, 7 Khoon Maaf's Susaana - all of them were very challenging and she carried out with excellence in every bit of them. But Jhilmil Chatterjee was the most challenging role for her till date which she carried out excellently. Even this role was previously experimented in My Name Is Khan, but Jhilmil somehow looked much convincing than Rizwan. She went to the core of her role and came out with the same sensitivity. Her raucous voice added a special feature to her role while her genius expressions and body language were doing perfectly fine. To me, this was her best performance in a motion picture till date.I can't call up since when I had seen such a wonderful debut of a heroine. Ileana D'Cruz does a outstandingly mesmerizing job as a first-timer in Hindi movies. Her character had simplicity over the top and too many shades which she was very capable to carry out brilliantly. Her performance when she was shown in her old age was magnificent. Her expressions at that time seemed like she was a very conversant actor and not a d\u00e9butante. It was hard to believe that this was her movie, performance-wise. This girl can work wonders if she is given right scripts like these.Saurabh Shukla was outstanding. More or less, he was also a very close character to Barfi. Aakash Khurana as Barfi's dad was magnificent. Aashish Vidyarthi was tremendous. Rupa Ganguly was also damn good. Jishu Sengupta rocked in such a short role. Haradhon Bandopadhyay did tremendous as he always does.Finally, Films like Barfi! make arrival raising humongous expectations in people's heart and efficiently doesn't let down even a single bit. It's no doubt magical but some flaws dug very deep creates a harmful impression at times. Still, please go and watch it. Good movies like Barfi! appear very often and missing them is utter foolishness.",

Scenes lifted from so many films like Notebook,lovers concerto,etc,etc. Music, treatment copied from Amelie,etc. In fact every scene and direction is lifted from so many films(the list is too long). Greatest rip off of the century and worst part is they are sending it to the Oscars.Now coming to the review of this cheap remake. Seriously the screenplay s so bad..., the only saving grace is the cinematography. amazing lighting, framing and excellent photography. probably shooting with his camera thinking he is shooting for an original piece. The rest all r copied- so no need of reviewing them. So one star for cinematography. Rating-1/10. So there it is- 'shameless cheap rip off with a very bad screenplay'.What i suggest is- Go watch the original Korean classic (part of the superb THE VENGEANCE TRILOGY).",

            "content": "Actions speak louder than words, and Barfi manages to pull it off rather well. At the very beginning of the movie we are introduced to Barfi (originally named Murphy, but pronounced Barfi by the protagonist) a deaf and mute individual who lives his life filled with mischief and mayhem despite his physical disabilities. But Barfi is not a story about the tragic life of a physically disabled individual, but more of a love story that delves so deep into the characters that they become devoid of their disabilities.The movie revolves around Barfi falling in love with the beautiful Shruti (played wonderfully by IlleanaD'Cruz) who also happens to love Barfi in spite of already being engaged to a wealthy man. After a few outings and romantic moments, Shruti decides to carry on and wed her wealthy fianc\u00e9, leaving Barfi a heart-broken wreck.Enter Jhilmil, a young autistic girl belonging to a wealthy family, but is completely ignored by her parents as well as society. In the time Barfi is getting over his heartbreak, his father suffers an attack and Barfi has to desperately raise the capital for the operation. He decides to kidnap Jhilmil and ask her father for ransom to pay for the operation. But in a bizarre turn of events Barfi and Jhilmil realize that they are perfect for each other and learn their physical disabilities are no longer nuisances.Barfi brings to memory the magnificent escapades of Charlie Chaplin portrayed brilliantly by the talented Ranbir Kapoor. His entire body language and behavior of the character was simply a delight to watch. From his numerous escapes from the law to the comical situations he unintentionally gets himself into, it was entirely a treat for the eyes.Priyanka Chopra as well has done a fantastic job of getting into the character of the autistic young girl named Jhilmil. But the scenes of her portrayal that shouted brilliance and proved rather heart wrenching were those of her riveting cries for Barfi every time he left her side. Her performance was outstanding and can easily be compared to that of the autistic Sean Penn in I Am Sam. That role won Sean Penn a Best Actor award and the same could surely be said for Priyanka.Anurag Basu has managed to capture the beautiful scenery of Darjeeling and Kolkata with finesse and add to that the wonderful music and background score makes the viewing of Barfi a breath of fresh air. All in all Barfi hits the right notes with story, performance, screenplay, sound and direction being above excellence. The movie is proof that a film about the physically challenged doesn't have to be the conventional pitiful and sorrowful experience, but instead it can be a joyful and charming piece of cinema that will leave you speechless.",

About the copied scenes and storyline.Its true that many scenes are copied from many different films, especially Korean movies. Seems director Anurag Basu is a fan of Korean movies,(just like me!).But keeping that fact aside, the presentation of the movie is quite good. A simple story is narrated in flashbacks in a suspense kind of way which makes it quite interesting and gripping.As far as acting is concerned everyone did well, though i wished to see more of Jhilmil. And Ileana too for her charming presence!There are many things which i would like to say, but i suggest u better watch Barfi and feel the emotions yourself.Overall, a nice feel good type of movie.

Barfi falls for soon to be married Shruti played by southern superstar Ileana D Cruz. Ileana looks pretty throughout and impresses you especially in her Bengali avatar. The first half is all about Barfi while second half belongs to autistic Jhilmil played by Priyanka Chopra. Priyanka Chopra makes her character unbelievably believable and in fact she almost steals the limelight from Ranbir Kapoor when the movie is over. Her performance will be remembered as we remember Rani Mukerjee for Black. But actually, behind all these stellar performances lies the sheer brilliance and imagination of writer-director Anurag Basu who keeps the movie evenly paced and mixes the funny and emotional moments with ease. Although Anurag Basu let the movie go a bit lengthy by introducing an unnecessary suspense sub-plot but fortunately it's over before it spoils your fun. This is a movie which asks you to watch it again and again so that you can live those countless beautiful moments. You will find yourself running out of adjectives when appreciating the performances delivered.",

            "content": "Anurag Basu after a long gap comes back and that too with a bang. The film makes you speechless literally However I doubt all will like it or understand it, as it's not the typical entertainer It does remind you of Charlie Chaplin type films, and does borrow from English, Hindi and Silent films perhaps but overall it's a completely different experience at least for Indian cinema. The film follows the non-linear pattern, moving from 2012 to 1978 to 1972 Something Anurag had shown expertise with GANGSTER and here too it is well used. The going-ons do get repetitve but the story is superb though some portions may not be sensible but let's put it, It's a fairytale type film with it's heart at the right place. The film keeps you involved mostly albeit at times the pace does get slow common with such films Several scenes stay in your mind till the show ends like Ranbhir's breakdown when he sees Illeana and her fianc\u00e9, Priyanka's outburst after her song and many more Direction by Anurag Basu is simply superb Music by Pritam is superb, Ashiya, Main Kya Karoon, Barfi and all songs are fab Camera-work is superb, the locales of Darjeeling, Kolkata are well shown though not sure how authentic there are(1972,1978 portions)Ranbhir Kapoor lives the role of Murphy, He is flawless conveying so much through gestures, expressions The actor proves yet again he is amongst the best actors Priyanka Chopra after a long time gives a brilliant performance Saying it's her career best so far is an understatement. Both performances are awardworthy Ileena Dcruz a Mumbai based South Heroine who stayed few years in Goa makes her debut and does a brilliant job, Amongst rest Saurabh Shukla is perfect and entertains, Akash Khurana is superb, Ashish Vidhyarthi is superb again, rest are good too",

            "content": "\"Barfi!,\" from directing to cinematography to editing, is well put together, especially for an Indian movie. I really enjoy how the film tends to focus on the positive as opposed to all the melodrama. Yes, it does get melodramatic, but not for too long. We get some beautiful shots of the scenery, but what would a technically sound film be without a script? This film has top notch writing with interesting characters and a sweet story that will melt the coldest of hearts. The story is pretty simple, but it is done in a unique way. There is minimal dialogue and most of it is conveyed through action, sort of like classic movies of the past. It's cute and adds to the overall charm of the film. However, the story is over complicated by some contrived plot points. One in particular happens towards the end of the film, but for the most part it doesn't take away much from the film. Another issue would be with how the story is told, at times it gets confusing because it jumps from brief moments of three different time periods. Even with some of these issues the film manages to come through with a sweet, touching, and charming story.Acting is top tier for the most part. Ranbir Kapoor proves yet again that he is the new leading man in Indian cinema. His performance of Barfi is touching yet subtle. He has a sense of charm and charisma that bleeds onto the screen. No matter what the character is doing, you can't help, but love him. Priyanka Chopra gives a career transforming performance. She's usually known as the beauty queen, but here she shows a lot of depth and understanding for her autistic character. I couldn't believe that this is the same person. The rest of the cast is good, but the one to look out for is Ileana D'Cruz, who made her Bollywood debut. Her character is emotionally disturbed and indecisive. She's likable and we can root for her.The score and songs for this film are great as well. The score has a upbeat style to it that at the same time feels whimsical. It brings you back to an era of your own youth. The songs are equally as good. They are fun and super catchy. They drive their respective scene along and it helps glide over some of the melodramatic moments.Overall \"Barfi!\" is a fun and entertaining flick with a lot of heart. The story is well told and fairly original. The cast of characters are colorful and their respective actors do justice to their complex roles. Music is a driving force for this film and aids in each scene. While the movie can get confusing and the third act feels a bit contrived, the film's charm and sweetness more than makes up for it. I give it 4/5, There's enough entertainment and lovable moments to overlook any missteps.",

Plot line is also somewhat unbelievable at few places. For example, how could this deaf and mute hero of this movie have taken care of himself & his ward during their travels. He didn't have money for medical expenses of his father. Where did he get money to survive for 5-6 months? Overall, it was a disappointment. This movie could have been much better.",

            "content": "The moment you take your seat,you are greeted with a background voice & music much before the movie actually starts transferring the whole audience to the innocent world of Barfi,much before the actual movie commences. At the surface level it's a simple story about a deaf and mute poor boy.He was named after the famous Murphy radio company but within the limitations of his speaking disability he used to utter his name in such a way it sounded \"Barfi\".Thus innocent journey of jolly Barfi begins who is loved by all,bringing smile to all.He falls for the beautiful Shruti who reciprocates but then being uncertain about the future of the relationship couldn't hold onto it.Meanwhile Barfi falls for autistic Jhilmil,his childhood friend and thus follows an cute journey of love,friendship,hope by which the 3 lives gets intertwined and changed forever. Basu deserves a running ovation for his treatment.Starting with present day Darjeeling we see an aged Barfi going steadily towards a camera with the frame shifting to aged Shruti who starts narrating her experience with Barfi.From there the film goes back to 1978 Kolkata from where it shifts to 1970 Darjeeling.The usage of back and forth narrative has been executed with utter precision. It is difficult to handle three time-frames in a film but Basu's treatment made it look effortless.I could never have expected such a narrative style in mainstream Bollywood and that also for a romantic film.The film about two disabled characters is like walking on the edge.A slight exaggeration would have led to melodrama and that never happened.The audience could empathize with Barfi and thus becomes a part of his journey of love,innocence and above all the quest for Happiness.The film tells you to hold on to your loved ones. Barfi knows his shortcomings and has his share of insecurities.He is afraid of losing his best friend or lady love and to test his relationship he used to cut a lamppost and stand at a distance from it holding his friend's hand.He would keep a bottle in front of them and every time the post would fall just in front of them breaking that bottle.In this way he used to test the strength of his relationship.The sequence has been used subtly to capture the relationship of Barfi with Shruti and Jhilmil.Most of the film is silent yet there are layers of language within it which is left to the viewers for interpretation.The little dialogues in the film are itself gems.One such is said by Shruti about her relationship with her present husband that even though they could speak the burden of words had only literary meaning but no feeling while Barfi's silent gestures could emote more than that. The Chou dance sequence in some village of West Bengal tighten the dream and reality of Barfi-Jhilmil's life;a sequence where both loosens themselves while they dance insanely to the beats.The scene is a slap to man-made sophistication that bounds an individual to live against his own will. Technically the film is flawless.Poddar's production design deserves award for recreating 70s Kolkata & Darjeeling without flaw.The detailing being taken care of for the continuity of shot needs to be appreciated.Verman's camera is another hero of the film.Barfi's world is like a canvas which had been captured with apt use of various colours which reflects Barfi's ampleness of Life.Basu's visual imagery reflects his creative depth which get's captured by Verman's lens.Even while dealing with the characters the camera angles are rigorously thought of.Whenever we see anything through the eyes of Barfi the surroundings gets blurred as Barfi concentrates on one person and read them.The editing is top-notch.With a film with non-linear narrative one has to be perfect with editing.Music is superb.With an orchestra like setting the background music elevated the silent scenes.Pritam's music really helps in pushing the narrative with apt lyrics.This is probably the best album of the year with Wasseypur. Ranbir Kapoor sealed the fact that he is in competition with only himself.His choice of film shows his thirst for excellence.He brings Barfi to life with his infectious smile and expressive eyes.He has the charm and innocence which he uses to his favour.Ileana makes a promising debut with her portrayal of Shruti.With saree clad she looked the perfect Bengali housewife,the epitome of love and purity.With her expressive eyes she nosedives into heart of audience.Her strive against impression and gestures with her mother shows typical human insecurity to chose between love and social security.Towards the climax one could feel the vacuum in her heart.Priyanka Chopra has showed her capabilities with 7 Khoon Maaf and goes one step ahead with Jhilmil Chatterjee,the sweet autistic girl who is unwanted in her family and is raised at Muskan\u2013a home for child with disabilities.While SRK was stiff in My Name is Khan here we see a performance that brings out the nuances of the disability more naturally.Though at few scenes she kind of reacted as if she is a retard but the next moment her following dialogue complimented her action thus looking satisfactory.Saurabh Shukla is one of the greatest albeit under-used actors and as Inspector Dutta he shows several emotions running over different time span.His Chaplin-esque sequences with Barfi bring in pure laughter which is sadly missing nowadays.Akash khurana as Barfi's father is effective.Roopa Ganguly is sophisticatedly restrained as Shruti's mother and the mother-daughter relationship is too real.Haradhan Banerjee as Dadu is brilliant.He is one of the finest actors of Indian cinema who was discovered by legendary Ray.Recently he has been insufficiently used by Bengali film industry.Ashish Vidyarthi is fine as always.The person who played Jang Bahadur is good.Jishu Sengupta in a small role fits in.The whole off-beat casting went in favour of the film. Overall Barfi is a visual treat with captivating performance that brings smile.Surely Chaplin,Buster Keaton would have praised Basu's effort of creating a silent world which is so expressive.It will be benchmark for Indian love stories.There is lot to learn from Barfi..lot to follow.Listen to your heart.And Don't worry; be Barfi..Always.",

            "content": "BARFI! is about following your heart, a crime caper and, most importantly, a love story between two handicapped people.The final part is something that's hardly shown in movies, and the fact that it is depicted realistically, with all the couple's problems, make it even more endearing. So, full credit goes to writer-director Anurag Basu for developing this sweet and humorous flick.Ranbir Kapoor plays the titular character who is deaf and mute, but gets along with people and shines in every scene with his Chaplin-like antics and honesty.Set in the Unesco World Heritage Site of Darjeeling, famous for its tea industry and Himalayan Railway, the movie shows how Barfi meets Shruti (dazzling newcomer Ileana D'cruz), who initially is resistant to his charms and his wary of his handicap, but his persistence and charm wear her down and they eventually hit it off.However, Shruti's mother isn't too keen on her going out with a handicapped person, so she takes her to watch a woodcutter from a distance. The mum says she once loved that man, but now thinks of what would have happened to her had she taken a different path.Shruti, of course, has been promised to a rich guy with all his physical senses intact, so it seems like a no-brainer for her.But, as I said before, Barfi is, if not, terribly persistent. Even after accepting Shruti's mum's gentle rebuff of him, he explodes at Shruti, not in words, but through his flailing arms and cold eyes, accusing her of sacrificing love for wealth. His hurt and despair are there for all to see.The movie may confuse viewers through its use of non-linear narrative structure. It starts in the present day but then moves between 1972, 1978 and the 1980s with fluidity. I can assure viewers, however, that their patience is well rewarded.At the start, we see Barfi running away from a cop from the rooftop of a house. We're not told why, but we're sucked into the movie as Barfi evades the cop using a rickety ladder to balance himself on a wall, and even employs the use of a mirror in an ingenuous way to outwit the latter.This, dear readers, is the chase scene that should have replaced that in Salman Khan's Ek Tha Tiger.Priyanka Chopra is not known for her gravitas, but she puts in a performance that is subtle and shimmering. Her autistic character, Jhimil Singh, can be said to resemble that of Dustin Hoffman's character in Rain Man.That is true, but Prinyanka's gestures and eye movement are a delight to observe. Watch what her Jhimil thinks of the threat of Shruti, and becomes possessive of Barfi, after the two are reconciled after being apart for a long time.In the meantime, Shruti is now married to the rich guy but there's a spark missing between them.She mulls over the fact that she and her husband are 'perfect' but yet imperfect in their love, but for Barfi and Jhimil, while they may be imperfect, their love transcends everything else. She admires that, and is even jealous of it.Later on, she finally takes the road not taken to be with Barfi, but our dear hero's heart and mind are with Jhimil.The songs in the movie are another delight, too. There are no subtitles for them but that in no way hinders our enjoyment of them.www.jeffleemovies.com (FB and Twitter)",

Ranbir Kapoor plays Barfi, a deaf, mute and clumsy individual, who nonetheless is highly expressive, articulate and creative by means of gestures and actions. He struggles to win the affection of the lady of his dreams, though his advances are rebuffed, and soon he finds his life inexorably tangled with that of an autistic girl named Jhilmil(Priyanka Chopra). This is the first Priyanka Chopra movie that I have seen, and I instantly fell in love with her. You do not see an ounce of the glamor, sex appeal and charisma associated with a beauty queen, just a plain, mentally challenged, autistic individual who is limited in her ability to emote and express, and yet touches your heart so profoundly that you will have tears in your eyes by the end. How these two unusual characters come together and hit it off is the stuff this movie is made off. Very entertaining, touching and poignant movie! I can relate completely to it since I am a teacher, and deal with many children/adults who are extremely intelligent and creative, yet suffer from relationship and social problems because they are wired differently and express their emotions in unusual ways.

            "content": "It's a time in bollywood where we can see some 'heavy' commercial cinema being made such as 'Bol Bachhan', 'Ek Tha Tiger' where everyone are just talking about those 100 or 200 crore barriers. It's now a money grabbing fight for those hundered of crores. So why does 'Anurag Basu comes up with a movie like 'BARFI' where his lead actor or actress does not get to have any dialogues or lines to speak where they can get those hooting and the whistles from the public (like the usual 'one liners' which are religiously followed in Bollywood). Well, to tell you, it does not matter one bit because 'BARFI' beautifully manages to hold you despite being more of a 'Silent Cinema'. BARFI is the story of a deaf and mute boy played by Ranbir Kapoor, through which Anurag Basu tries to gives us a message that, we all are surrounded with happinness all around us, it's just that we are strangled up so much in our daily life of artificial complexities that we don't recognize the little any tiny things that are capable of giving us immense happinness, peace and comfort. Priyanka Chopra's character too is one which is suffering from a disease known as 'Autism'. It's a disorder of one's neural system. Priyanka plays the character of the disabled girl with absolute brilliance where we can really feel for her. She easily manages to hold the audiences at their perfect nerve.BARFI is mostly a 'Silent film, where almost the entire movie is in narrative, but, this really does not even slightly affects it in any bad way and therefore hats off to Anurag, Ranbir, Priyanka and Pritam (Music Director) for that. The movie has got arguably the most soulful music of 2012. A movie in which you don't have any verbal connection among the lead actors, the music does that part in a very justified manner. The bond of Ranbir and Priyanka gets strengthenend inside the minds of the audiences mainly because of the soulful music which sounds abolutely soothing to the ear.Barfi may be a movie not for everyone. The movie has its certain drawbacks. There are quite a few moments in the film which tends to bore the audience at more than one instances. That said, it is certainly not a movie to miss out. There are a number of sequences where you will laugh your hearts out.Talking about Ranbir Kapoor, his acting skills has polished up so vividly that its so much fascinating to see. Ever since 'Rocket Singh' his skill as an actor has improved a lot. Ranbir who was just awesome in 'Rockstar' , plays this deaf and mute character surprisingly with so much ease and charm. This is among the best performances given by both Ranbir as well as Priyanka recently. As far as Illeana D'Cruz, I really did'nt find her connecting with the plot of the film at any stage. Although, the screen presence of Illeana may be more than that of Priyanka but Priyanka easily takes you away with her innocence. There are times when you want to see more of Ranbir and Priyanka moments rather than with Illeana.Barfi really could have been a great film but what kills it is its runtime. Its too long, which adds up the boredom and enables the audiences to yawn a bit too.Well , Otherwise Barfi is certainly a must watch. You will not hate it ,though its not guaranteed that you will really love it. Decide for yourself, I liked it. Its a sincere effort from Anurag Basu and his team to present to the public one of the most pure and innocent film for 2012. Watch it for Ranbir and Priyanka.",

            "content": "What will you remember the year 2012 for? I shall ever remember it for some of the greatest movies our quality deprived Indian Cinema produced. Seems like all the film-makers have suddenly realized that all good work requires nothing but self-revelation. And they are working on it - producing results which the human race would have never expected of. They have suddenly realized that experience can let you experiment and that if it turns out to be successful, can lead you to a perfect evolution. Time's evolving. Yes the process has been little slow, but look what its fetching you. For those who used to believe in the power of cinema must be feeling very relieved, so am I.It would be very derogatory for me to talk anything about Barfi. If I start talking about it, may be I run out of words, because doing so is simply a gargantuan task. Someone once said - \"There are two types of films: those that employ the resources of the theater (actors, direction, etc...) and use the camera in order to reproduce; those that employ the resources of cinematography and use the camera to create\". I say there exits a third category which involves the both in an appropriate proportion and produces something miraculous, something beyond imagination. Barfi is a combined effort of an immaculate direction, a great script and some never seen before acting. Gone are those days when it used to take a cheapo to cry in a direction-less movie and get applauds from the lost souls. You now need to have a proper substance and then only you can leave an indelible imprint on the million minds. When it comes to portray disability on the celluloid, it takes something more than humanitarian efforts for the entire crew. The characters have to speak with their eyes, their movements must speak. The direction has to be impeccable. Not a single emotion should escape the mind of the audience - immersive - so should be the power of expression. An autistic person's role has to be the most difficult and needs a sorcerer's touch. I am simply reminded of Dustin Hoffman's role in Rain Man and Priyanka Chopra played it no less exceptional - one of the most touching performances I have ever seen. Ranbir Kapoor has properly fit himself in any kind of role he has ever been assigned. He is mute yet so expressive, funny yet so touching. And the love-story of these two disables has been so wonderfully and subtly knitted that once you are entangled you have no escape. Burfi opens to you doors to an ethereal world created through a poetic imagination. With all these excellence the team might have fetched themselves numerous awards already and yet again set examples for all the aspiring actors and directors. All it takes for them to align to the same trend. Its the time we can see cinema riding the path of Resurrection. We were never out of talent but the ideas were just lacking. Movies like Kahaani, Paan Singh Tomar, Barfi and others have shown to the world how much potential we carry. With a sudden out-pour of fresh new ideas for last few months, the faith in cinema has certainly been restored. We can expect more and more stunners in coming times to blow and boggle our minds.",

            "content": "Drawing inspiration from Charlie Chaplin, 'The Notebook' and a few others, the director of movies such as 'Gangster' and 'Life in a Metro', Anurag Basu has also drawn much slack. However, if you choose to look beyond those few scenes, Barfi has a real, heart-warming story to tell and Basu was quite capable of portraying it with the talents of Ranbir Kapoor and surprisingly, Priyanka Chopra. Unlike his past works, Basu turns poetic in his manner of story telling and therefore, the going is slower. Yet, the result is more artful and pleasing as one can better relate to each character and like them. The film teaches us a simple lesson about love that it is unbiased, selfless and inspiring. With a talented cast, outstanding cinematography, sweet melodies by Pritam and equal amounts of every emotion, Barfi is among the best entertainers of recent times and in the age when we are looking down south for remakes, it is all the more cherishable. In the tranquil hills of Darjeeling, the loudest noise and ruckus is created by one who is mute and deaf. Such is Barfi's mischievous charm that irks the local Police and his father but tempts the friendship and love of Shruti (Ileana). Theirs is such a petulant relationship of old school flirting and romance which is based on Barfi's good heart rather than his flaws and other virtues. Then there is Jhilmil (Priyanka Chopra), Barfi's childhood friend whose autism is no barrier for Barfi's kindness. Societal pressure, its norms and orthodox values takes the definitive course of this triangle which only brings Jhilmil and Barfi closer. Ranbir Kapoor's performance is simply exemplary. His versatility is proved yet again and with a challenging role like this, he easily becomes the character and sketches himself in our memory. As long as he continues to go against the norm, pursuing scripts with strong characters, he is on his way to being the best of our generation. Ileana looks beautiful in every scene and although her role wasn't a challenge, her expressions were suited to every scene. Saurabh Shukla was hilarious and very natural as the cop who is always chasing Barfi. But the real surprise is Priyanka Chopra as Jhilmil. One cannot imagine that she was also capable of pulling this off. She lets go of her glamorous self completely and adorns this autistic girl's role with good understanding. One can sit back in disbelief that this is the actress who hams her way through several movies while being pretentious in the others. Director Anurag Basu has kept things simple and used Pritam's music to suit Barfi's nature and Darjeeling's serene beauty that is captured in such a spectacular manner by S. Ravi Verman. The background score is extremely important when your lead actors do not speak at all and there too, the film impresses. Mohit Chauhan's Aala Barfi once again proves that he's the best around while Nikhil Paul George in Main Kya Karoon and Aashiyan is brilliant. Then of course you have Papon's magic in Kyon which makes this soundtrack a melody you can sing along and smile to.Basu's story telling is immersive and he manages to keep you entertained with frequent comic scenes involving Barfi, Jhilmil and the Police. Even after an emotionally strong scene, Barfi will manage to make you smile because he moves on to embrace life in every moment rather than sulking in one. Barfi is uncomplicated, unpretentious and just like his heart, is pure at the core. He might occasionally step into Chaplin's shoes but when you look beyond that, it is Ranbir Kapoor showcasing a talent that is worthy of a loud applause. 9.09 on a scale of 1-10.",

It takes a brave actress to play a character like this, and Priankya continues on the path she set out on in 7 Khoon Maaf. Ranbir was what held the thing together. Without his humour (hard if the only word you say in the movie is \"Barfi\") it would have come apart. Ileana was excellent as well. And the fat policeman could have been over the top, but the actor who played him was restrained enough to make it both humorous and relatively realistic. And if you haven't heard Priyanka sing \"In My City,\" do it now. She's amazing. I wish she would make a movie every month!",

            "content": "Firstly the expectations were too very high, mainly after the hyped & stupendous reviews and secondly they were all shoddily devastated at the end of full-time. Mr. Anurag Basu (gave him second chance after KITES) always had common Indian people in his mind, who engage themselves watching 'saas-bahu soaps', neatly wasting their time and thought was gifting them a MASTERPIECE by making Barfi, almost forgetting that there are still few people who have seen 'City Lights' and 'Notebook'. The worst part was, it did resemble (badly) to both of those but not at all as good as seeing any part as they did. A ditto Hindi copy of either would have been better. The acting of none of the characters was up to par. Even veteran in the business, Haradhan Bannerjee failed to make a mark and so did Saurabh Shukla. A lot very was expected from these two, when they could have been used very adequately by director. The acting throughout was so very going against nature and abnormal. Although autism and spastics was a good excuse, but (for dear critics, giving the film 4.5/5) do really spastics really behave so, as Priyanka and Ranbir did. Do we ever see a mute and deaf holding window pane of a bus and riding a cycle, heroin sitting inside the bus and singing and dancing all of a sudden in public, we don't, and here was made to sit and tolerate these vistas. Too bad to again realize that it was again a mainstream, commercial movie. Ileana d'cruz, isn't the one to be blamed since the direction itself was poor.Storyline was again same, a greedy dad, few kind maids, a cruel mom and a love triangle and the time to time narration was surely an added perk and thus came into existence another typical 'Hindi Film', which we have been seeing since our childhood. Mr. Basu even tried to forcibly pierce a bit of thrill, which didn't worked and was again a glitch. Equally the climax was tackily made again was unnatural while few were exact photo-copy of 'Notebook's' climax (when will Bollywood stop making lame duplicates). Also did seemed like Mr. Basu thought that just graying the hairs and making them trembling their fingers would make someone look old, a big gaffe again. Kolkata was portrayed good, still much better could have been done and same was for Darjeeling. Editing sometimes was nice. Few scenes were very nicely crafted. Music was the best part. In short, again a Bollywood movie, with a twist and a scene from here and there, not at all a thriller, indeed just another comedy. Moderately Recommendable. No loss if it goes unwatched.",

Ranbir \"rises\" with such simple-yet-splendid on-screen persona. He was an absolute treat to the eyes. It won't be an exaggeration that he may have surpassed his performance in ROCKSTAR with this one. Priyanka Chopra, as always, was quite convincing and neat in playing an autistic girl and was able to emote quite subtly. However, the real surprise of the film was Ileana D'Cruz, a well-known name in the South Indian films though, a d\u00e9butante in Hindi films. Undoubtedly, she was very gorgeous on-screen playing her Bengali dame character with a mellowed heart. The supporting cast of Saurabh Shukla and Rupa Ganguly were very neat as being veterans. And as quoted in THE DIRTY PICTURE...\"Har film ka ek hi Hero hota hain...Director\". Indeed, Anurag Basu was able to outshine his previous works with this film, that he wrote and directed. Indeed, an impressive job done. By in large, the film is a must-watch for the lovers of rom-coms and of artistic cinema alike. Regarding the question that will this film give it's value for money I'd rather say that one will be in \"sure and sheer profit!\"",

            "content": "In midst of urban city life where everyone is tied to theirs jobs, family ,responsibilities etc. one always tends to forget living their life to the fullest. Barfi, a message-oriented film, inspires to enjoy every second of your life as you will never get another chance to live. It is a feel-good film that sends out a signal \u2013 \"Don't Worry, everything is going to be alright\" Barfi is a character played by Ranbir Kapoor, a feel-free young clad who can neither speak nor listen , but always is ready with prank up to his shoulder. He is the talk of town and quite mischievous as well. His life turns upside down when he meets two beautiful ladies in his life, Shruti Ghosh (played by Illeana D' Cruz) and Jhilmill Chatterjee (played by Priyanka Chopra).Anurag Basu ( Murder , Life in a Metro , Kites) has surely been inspired from Charlie Chaplin's antic to put in more fun-loving character of Barfi. But more than that, Basu has created a different scenario in the Indian Cinema by capturing the nature's beauty at its best. He is not only a proficient story-teller but also has good sense of photography as well. The film also dwells on childhood fantasy like creating reflection of light on the wall with glass, sailing paper boat on the water during rainy season, playing with firefly in the night. It will take you a world of fantasy and imagination and create an aura of its own. Hats off to Anurag Basu to make a film on differently-abled people, who has live more glorious and eventful than us. The screenplay is tight holding viewer's attention to the core. Art direction is gorgeous. Camera-work by Ravi Varman needs special mention here. He has truly captured the beautiful locales of Bengal in his camera which audiences will definitely love it. Since both Ranbir and Priyanka do not have many dialogues , it is background score which emblems with the scenes here. Music by Pritam is soulful. Few minutes of trimming in the second half would have helped little more. Coming to the performances, it is Ranbir's show all the way. He is a gifted actor like his parent and takes his family name to one level next. The versatile actor emotes so accurately through his facial expression that is difficult to imagine anyone else in this character. He is funny, witty, and impressive with perfect timing of his body language. I am sure he is going to win an award for his brave performance. Priyanka Chopra was a complete surprise portraying the role of mentally challenged girl with ease. She gets into the character completely and gives an electrifying performance. Illeana does a fantastic job as new-comer. She gives a full-fledged support to the movie and will be loved by audience for her supporting role. Barfi is film which inspires and teaches you to appreciate and celebrate life. We always crib about everything in life we don't have but we never enjoy the things that is always there for us. Go and indulge yourself in BARFI to respect and enjoy the moments in LIFE. Strongly recommended",

The art of plagiarism is so deeply embedded in the movie that it over- shadows the director's effort to tell a sensible, feel-good and meaningful love story. To a certain extent it can be accepted that AB's story had some new to offer for typical Indian audience. But for movie-lovers, who have seen the famous Tramp's movies, it is hardly surprising to notice that AB had put very little effort and time to create something new.And it is not only limited to humour, it is the story plot, camera angles, music (almost all key elements) has just been sucked out from 'n' number of movies and pasted together. My point of writing on IMDb is to express my feeling of dissatisfaction and to a certain extent a feeling of humiliation for the matter of fact that Barfi has been India's best film nomination to Oscars. Now imagine those guys on panel laughing their heart out when they review this film. If AB had gone for Oxford style reference system and applied that for every clip/frame/soundtrack/camera angle that he had used to make this film, I bet he would've needed two A4 size pages to list the references, and that is not a good report.",

            "content": "I watched Barfi relatively late, after its nomination as the Indian entry for the Oscars has been declared. Now accusations are being levied on this movie for having a good dose of plagiarism, lifting the original idea from Benny & Joon (1993) and several scenes and pieces from various Hollywood movies.After watching this brilliant movie which generates both laughs and tears, I can say that the accusers are forgetting the real inspiration for Anurag Basu, the director and Ranbir Kapoor, the actor. And that real inspiration is Raj Kapoor. Interestingly, the first part of Raj Kapoor's full name is Ranbir only (complete name is Ranbir Raj Kapoor) and his son, Rishi Kapoor christened his son after the name of his legendary father only. This way Ranbir Kapoor got his name. While watching it in the theatre, the complete movie seemed to me like a tribute to the on-screen personality and several movies of Raj Kapoor, especially Mera Naam Joker (1970). Raj Kapoor himself was inspired by Charlie Chaplin, hence no wonder, this movie as well as Ranbir's character is Chaplinisque. He is a natural actor and the shoes of his legendary grandfather, the greatest showman of Bollywood, seem to be fitting him perfectly in this movie. Kisi Ki Mustarahaton Pe Ho Nisaar, Kisi Ka Dard Mil Sake To Le Udhaar, Kisi Ke Vaaste Ho Tere Dil Mein Pyaar, Jeena Isi Ka Naam Hai. Remember Raj Kapoor ? Find the same message being conveyed by deaf and mute Barfi in this movie.Barfi is the love-triangle of a deaf-mute boy, an autistic girl and a normal Bengali girl who pass through different tests of life to discover that love is something to feel. It can't be defined or tested on the norms of the society who strive to clip its wings. The thing I feel that the abnormal characters of this movie knew it beforehand and the discovery was only for the normal girl who sacrificed the most and gained proportionately very less. But the thing is that getting the love of the person you love is not that easy because it depends upon that person or the other external factors but loving someone from your side is always easy because it is in your hands and nobody can stop you from that or imprison your sentiments. However, it emerges naturally in your heart and you cannot deliberately love some particular person to suit the practical situation of life (like marriage). That Shruti (Ileana D' Cruz) learns by loving Barfi (Ranbir Kapoor) who does not love her but an autistic girl, Jhilmil (Priyanka Chopra). Frankly speaking, the base of this story is Barfi, the male but the character which puts all the threads of this story together is Shruti, the losing girl who is satisfied by loving only, letting go the desire to get the love of the man she loves.The personality of Ranbir (and also many incidents taking place with him) reminded me of Mera Naam Joker, the zenith as well as the Waterloo of Raj Kapoor. However the love-triangle has conspicuous resemblance with a very old classic movie - Goonj Uthi Shehnaai (1959). In Goonj Uthi Shehnaai also, there is the character of Raamkali (akin to that of Shruti in Barfi)who selflessly loves the hero, Kishan (Rajendra Kumar), making a lot of sacrifices for him but without expecting any reciprocation or return. She knows that Kishan actually loves Gopi (Ameeta) but she becomes their accomplice and tries to help them in getting united. The way, Jhilmil is autistic in this movie, the same way, Gopi becomes insentient in that black and white classic movie. And the death comes for both the lovers simultaneously in both the movies with the third angle remaining alive to narrate the story to the world. Well, these similarities (intentional or unintentional) appear to be intriguing. But the thing that I liked in Goonj Uthi Shehnaai is that though Kishan does not love Raamkali (because he loves Gopi), he acknowledges the love of Raamkali for him and feels grateful to her for the sacrifices made by her for his sake. In Barfi, the protagonist is selfish from this angle that he is never shown to feel the abundant love and the great sacrifices of Shruti, leave aside acknowledging them. Shruti's love is great from this viewpoint and scores over the love of Barfi for Jhilmil.Ranbir Kapoor seems to have been born with acting in his genes. I have never seen him acting bad. In this movie, despite showing shadows of his late grandfather, he has demonstrated a peculiar originality at the same time. Priyanka Chopra has done marvellously in the difficult role and nobody seems to have noticed the less footage given to her role in the movie. However, the surprise package of this movie is debutante Ileana D' Cruz. Fresh ! Charming ! Impressive. Her role renders expansion to the roles of the other protagonists and she is simply superb in her performance. All others also fit their bill without any deficiency on anybody's part.Preetam's music and Swanand Kirkire's lyrics both are highly admirable. Preetam has kept the melody intact which is a great feat for a Hindi film composer of today.The art director has brought both Darjeeling and Kolkata alive on the screen. The cinematographer has also done so excellently that several scenes of this movie appear to be like beautiful paintings. It's a visual treat and hence can be enjoyed better on the big screen.Dialogs of the movie are very impressive and touching. The editor has used his scissors with such finesse that the movie moves quite fast in the first half and at a relatively slow pace in the second half which is completely in sync with the mood of the screenplay in both the halves.Barfi is imperfect, yet excellent. Will be considered a classic in the times to come.",

            "review_title": "I both loved and hated this movie",
            "content": "I have some pertinent questions to ask the director regarding this movie. They are the following: 1) Why has the movie been named 'Barfi!' when Jhilmil's character is of equal importance? The movie should have been named 'Barfi aur Jhilmil' (like Bunty aur Babli), or given any name other than just 'Barfi!' It's like ignoring the female character in the movie who has a major role to play in Barfi's life.2) Where is the chemistry between Barfi and Jhilmil? The film lacks scenes of closeness and intimacy that we usually associate with romantic love. Throughout the film, Barfi seems to TAKE CARE of Jhilmil more than love her, and Jhilmil looks absent-minded and lost in her own world. It seems Jhilmil looks upon Barfi more as a good friend than a lover. Agreed that Jhilmil is not in a state to understand what heterosexual love is, Yet a little intimacy on screen would've helped the audience to feel that Barfi and Jhilmil do have some feelings for each other that we usually associate with romantic love. But sadly, there's no romance or warmth between the lead pair.3) Non-linear narrative is fine, but too much of it confuses the audience. 'Barfi!' shows events taking place back and forth to the point that the audience gets confused about what's happening on screen. It's difficult for the audience to understand what's happening and feel for the characters at the same time. It's just plain human psychology. Understanding and feeling can't go together.4) Barfi is supposed to be a cute guy. In males, we define cuteness by certain standards. Ranbir Kapoor meets almost all the standards except one, and that is: HEIGHT. One might disagree with me, but it's a general rule that guys with short height (the so-called 'shortys') are considered cuter by women than tall guys. That's the reason why actors like Aamir Khan is still considered oh-so-cute by girls despite the fact that he's approaching 50. I believe Imraan Khan would have been the best actor to play the role of Barfi. Short height DOES make a guy look cuter. I don't know why but that's how it is.5) During 1972 and 1978, the Darjeeling toy train looked different. The bogies had smaller windows. It was much later (somewhere around 1996) that larger windows were added to give passengers a better view of the landscape outside. Yet we see the train with larger windows even in '72 and '78 in the film.6) The local cop Mr. Dutta at one time slaps Barfi at the police station. Surprisingly, we hear the sound of the slap first and see the slap falling later. Why?? 7) The message 'Cigarette smoking is injurious to health' comes on screen every time Barfi smokes a cigarette. Flashing the message once or twice was enough. Too much of it is paranoid.8) 'Kyaa tum phir Jhilmil ko wapas ley jaaoge?' The elderly Daju asks this to Mr. Chatterjee (Jhilmil's father) towards the end of the movie. But a little lipreading shows that Daju is saying something else during the '...ley jaaoge?' part of the question. Why this dubbing glitch? 9) India in 1972 never had Sintex-type water reservoirs atop buildings. Such reservoirs came much later, during the mid-eighties. Yet we see six such tanks in 1972 Darjeeling atop Keventer's Restaurant where Shruti walks in with her friend. Why this glitch? In this age of computer graphics, those reservoirs could have been erased easily from the scene, had the director been a little mindful of the fact that he was mistakenly capturing modern-day water tanks in one of his shots.",

            "content": "One of my all time favorites I can watch over and over again. I love this story and it is so well told. Both Ranbir (as Barfi) and Priyanka (as Jhilmil) show off their best performances yet and do so without hardly uttering a single word. Upcoming Illena D'Cruz plays her part very well and is destined for a great future. Every detail of this movie is very well done from the lighting (including glare from the sunlight in certain scenes) to each and every expression on the actors/actresses faces. Pay close attention to each and every move because just about anything that seems random at the time will be important later. The music score is outstanding and really lends itself well to the scenes which is applied. The filming locations are beautiful.A few folks accuse of blatant ripoffs of other movies and it does seem to borrow a lot of elements of other movies, but not enough from any that the whole movie seems a remake of another. It stands well on it's own and pays tribute to the best parts of other movies. Many scenes involve tribute scenes to silent film stars like Charlie Chaplain and Buster Keaton which I feel is great since Barfi cannot speak and it adds a comical sense to his character. It lends a new take to a group of new movie goers of the magic of silent films of past. Others seem to say that Priyanka does not represent someone with autism well. It would be hard for anyone to play that part and I didn't feel that was the case. Her actions are believable to get the point across. I applaud her for taking this tough role and doing so beautifully. It was also refreshing to see her in a role that didn't play on her beauty for once.My only gripe is the movie jumps around eras a bit too much and too soon. Make sure to catch the dates shown so you keep up with the details. It all pans out in the end. I found the second time I watched it, this was no longer an issue.I highly recommend you watch this movie again and again and soak yourself in the beauty of it. I also recommend this for anyone wanting to get into watching foreign films with subtitles as it is a little easier to get into since Barfi and Jhilmil do not need as many subtitles for their parts. Just enjoy their acting prowess.",

            "content": "With no dialogs but with a story, such is 'Barfi'. A film with 'zero' dialogs for the main protagonists, has a narrative that entirely revolves around 'Conversations'. Just a minute, did I just use the word 'film'? I better correct myself, films were all that I had watched before so far, this isn't one. It isn't a film. It is Barfi.Ranbir Kapoor was 'Rockstar', he still is. With Barfi he hasn't set any standards at all, he has simply set the sky open. Now there exists no upper bar for perfection, talent and devotion. Doing away the great Charlie Chaplin's act and being compared to him, he never seemed to budge. He was him. One of the sequence duplicated from Charlie Chaplin's 'City Lights' seemed a perfect tribute to the Universal star by our very own star who is set to go not just in books but in hearts with this performance. The glimpse of Charlie Chaplin's poster in the 'Statue' sequence is pacifying sight to see the acknowledgment. Through the mute and deaf Barfi (a name changed from Murphy to Burfi)', Ranbir has made a loud statement and it is a reaffirmation of his stature.As 'Rockstar' was Imtiaaz Ali's and Ranbin Kapoor's; 'Barfi' could well have belonged to Anurag (Basu) and Ranbir (Kapoor) entirely, had it not been for the 'Jhilmil' bite from Priyanka Chopra. Priyanka, who plays an 'autist' in Barfi is unbelievable. Any actress would have looked awful in the role she played only to be awesome. From the way she requests her 'Nanu'(Grandfather) with a 'please' to the way she yells 'Barfi', she has just made her character stand out of the league of the ordinary and she herself in the process has followed Ranbir's steps to scale the un- scalable.The little love-story of Shruti and Barfi and the not so little, but larger than life, sacrifice made by Shruti was a beautiful portrayal of love in itself. The story or the love, though incomplete, was complete in its own meaning. And this would have been not possible, hadn't it been for Ileana's 'under the skin' portrayal of Shruti. Her mother, played by Rupa Ganguly, too had her moments in the narrative when the director so perfectly conveyed the pain of 'lost love'. Saurabh Shukla, I wonder why I don't see much of him so often? Rather I question why doesn't the audience long to see more from him? So much he has in him to deliver; so much that he is the 'comic' and 'emotional' Policeman turned Homeopath who creates tickles with Barfi.Barfi has its moments scattered through the entire story that they seem to be divinely designed by the writer/director and put in its perfect place, like stars in the sky. Whether you talk of the comedy between Ranbir and Saurabh or the 'heart melting' expression and reaction by Ranbir when his love (Shruti) ditches him, the soul continues to be the same. It remains same in the helplessness of Jhilmil and her freedom, alike. Be it Barfi's father's love or of Jhilmil's Grandfather's trust when he witnesses Ranbir's love for Jhilmil; the soul continues in both. And through everything; through the entire biography of Barfi and Jhilmil, and with all the unjust justice to Shruti's love and sacrifice, it culminates for me in two scenes. First, when Jhilmil calls out for the 'deaf' Burfi from her window while he is walking away from 'Muskaan' with Shruti, who fighting her inner turmoils, turns and makes her choice, the choice to sacrifice yet again her love for his love. Second scene for me was the depiction of how Barfi understood his love; how well he understood Jhilmil was evident when he creates her dream of getting married to him into a reality and that too in a manner which she had experienced and dreamt of. Jhilmil's only love Barfi stayed his to all the extents she wanted to. Her (Jhilmil's) possessiveness for her love when she reclaimed it and attempted to hide it away from the girl (Shruti) who loved him did not end with Barfi's life, it continued with the little 'knot' of their little fingers to their afterlives.Anurag Basu's vision was so very well captured by the cinematographer Ravi Raman, that it is the first thing you notice about Barfi before you move on to Ranbir, to Shruti, to Jhilmil, to Music and eventually to the story. Barfi spoke like no one has spoken ever before. It is a silently presented work of art that, to me, was the most communicative- through the characters, the camera(cinematography), the background(beautiful landscapes of Darjeeling with its Tram), the time (1970s), the music but the dialogs. Anurag had fought Cancer in the past and won life. He seems to have a brought back a divinity from Him that he's busy spreading and sharing through his creation.\"I sincerely believe that I do not qualify to write a review of something that I feel is the best piece of cinema that I have had the opportunity to watch in my lifetime, from my lifetime.\" I do understand now; the passion, the devotion, the sincerity, the talent and the heart that was involved when Gurudutt or Satyajit Ray used to make movies. I can feel as an audience to Barfi, what their audience would have felt.I could say that if you don't watch it, you'll regret or you'll never forget the film and all the usual. Rather I'd make a plain statement that if you miss this you'll have something missing in your life all your life, and unfortunately you'll never feel it as you wouldn't have watched Barfi but you'll still know it. I urge you to go for it with a 'Please'.The ratings are for films not for Barfi!!~Vaibhav Shrivastava",

I'd say the best among the young lot, this guy manages to do something extra-ordinary in his every movie. A difficult role to pull off, he has managed it with ease. Effortless expressions, top notch acting. Illeana D'Cruz - Debut film and a pretty confident start. Looks pretty on the big screen. And then finally Priyanka Chopra - Whoaa!! what a performance simply fabulous. The best among the lot. One of her best performance till date. Coming to the technical part, with Mr. Basu taking part of story, screenplay and direction it has been done to perfection. Darjeeling has been captured beautifully. And even though the music has similarities to Amelie(2001) it has been pretty good. Music has a very important role in this movie since its more of a silent movie and Pritam has done a decent job. If you're into out of box stuff, go for Barfi ASAP.",

The film revolves around a deaf and dumb Guy named \u2013 \"Barfi\". His nature, way of tackling things and thoughts are what forms the major part of the story. The good thing is that the film presents the world of disabled and autistic people beautifully. You will not cry in the end because you are watching their disability but because of the emotions that develop gradually till the end.PROS:It is right to say that the film has copied scenes in many instances but you should not keep that in mind and watch the film, or you will not see and understand the true purpose of the film. The film is important in today's times. It invokes laughter and at the same time teaches you things which are very important in life. Now if we use some of the things from previous artists, just to make the film more interesting, then where is the problem? The important thing is that films should do what they are required to do. Among its many purposes it invokes people (though for a little time) to think rationally before doing anything and most of all tells that it is good to follow your heart and take risks. Priyanka Chopra too has done a wonderful job. Good thing is that the characters are not much and there is plenty of time to develop them. The music too was good (again somewhat copied.\uf04a).CONS:The only thing I didn't like was the length of the film. At some point of time, I was fed up with the idiosyncrasies of barfi. They started showing it way too many times and way too much. The ending of the film wasn't that charming.MESSAGE: \"The only risk in life is not to take risks.\"VERDICT: \"A recommended watch.\"",

The movie is so smartly made that one does not feel that the void of its main protagonist being a mute. The movie is shot beautifully in Darjeeling and Kolkata. A visual treat. The acting by Ranbir is outstanding. Talking with his expressions throughout the movie. Priyanka's role as an autistic girl is a revelation. she deserves rich praise as well. Ileana is a surprise package, looking so stunningly beautiful in Bengali attire with bright cotton saris. Pritam's music in the movie is also very fresh and apt for the script. Songs are simple but effective. The only drawback, if you nitpick, might be the fact that Anurag Basu tried too hard to make it into a suspense thriller, with story moving back and forth in time.

            "content": "Barfi is fresh for Bollywood. It is a great celebration of Life and at no point does it linger on the disabilities of the key characters. There is lightness about the movie, and the slapstick comedy enhances the experience, all credit to Ranbir's charm. The premise of the movie is a bit forced, but Anurag Basu somehow infuses credibility into the most unlikeliest of Love triangles, and makes it work. The slightly poor script is held together by wonderful acting by Ranbir Kapoor. He clearly is one of the very few authentic acting talents in Bollywood, and anything this guy touches turns to gold. Anurag Basu's mastercraft is visible throughout the movie with many moving touches. The whole backdrop of Darjeeling gives it a fresh feel and has been used really well. And the music is nice, and helps build the mood of the movie.But will it get the Oscars (It is India's official entry to Oscars)? I don't think so. It misses on a number of accounts, but the fatal flaw is that it is too long. Anurag Basu just did not have the heart to cut up this labour of love, and has left too much into the movie that distracts from building the story. The movie goes round in circles, the motives of characters are all suspect (and not in a good way). There are some nice moments, but the story starts lingering around too many of them, without adding anything new to the story. Props get overused \u2013 too many train scene, too many shots of Howrah bridge, too many paper birds, too many kidnappings of the same person. And the use of that band in the background \u2013 fresh for Bollywood, but this is a trick lifted from somewhere. Flashback is poorly used and does nothing to enhance the impact of the story. At some point you know how the movie will end, and the film does not disappoint.Other than Ranbir, all others actors are fairly clueless about what is going on \u2013 except for maybe the Saurabh Shula (The inspector). Priyanka Chopra (Jhilmil Chatterjee) has over interpreted an autistic person (and what is with that false fake looking gums?) and is uncomfortable in the role. Ileana D'Cruz (Shruti Sengupta) brings no special touch to the movie. The makeup is amateurish\u0085 and I think does serious damage to the credibility of the entire movie.With a 30 min cut, most flaws would have disappeared. Flashback should not have been used atall. That marriage song right at the end could have been used in the main story itself somewhere and replaced some of the other weaker segments, it is powerfully done but comes too late in the movie and is a wasted opportunity to build a stronger connect with the audience.Overall, I would rate it at 7/10 and would recommend you do watch it, but I am not betting on it winning the Oscars\u0085 (from my blog at http://www.rahulbalyan.com/ )",

            "content": "Woof! Where did that come from? That was my initial reaction upon watching this movie. Its a welcome reprieve from the typical bollywood movie overflowing with bemusing action scenes and a distorted bedtime story for a storyline. It is not quite as rebellious as many other offbeat movies which seem to be as critical of the society as they are of the film industry. This movie however follows a milder, more artistic approach if you like in portraying its satire. From what I could observe, it seems to have taken inspirations from a lot of sources, some pretty famous ones as well; Charlie Chaplin's movies, mute movies and old Hindi cinema to name a few, but instead of aping them like tonnes of Indian movies have over the years, this movie builds its own story using them, and does quite a commendable job of it, which is fine by me for it maintains its originality while doing so. I've seen some of Charlie Chaplin's works and Amelie as well, and I don't think its blatant copying or plagiarism. Its a story essentially of love that knows no limitations, something that everybody fascinates of and also regret of failing to draw the courage to take the all important life changing decision, something we are all familiar of. Therefore most people can readily identify with the story and be encouraged in their endeavours by the way the central character Barfi stays unflinchingly upbeat despite all odds and hardships at hand and struggles through them to make a right fist of his life. Backdrop, screenplay and acting, everything fits the bill. Though some might argue there are a lot of extraordinary situations for a movie that intends to stay practical, the overall story is still conceivable in my opinion. The humour is subtle and clever and considering the subject of the movie, most of it goes around in gestures, so the viewers might need to apply themselves a little bit more than your normal rom-com thing to pick up all of the jokes, which if you don't might end up spoiling your experience a tad, hence the complaints from few quarters of the movie being stretched or boring. Overall, if you don't go in there expecting melodramatic romance or vile humour you won't be disappointed by the touching, refreshing and immensely entertaining treat on show.",

Basu takes us to a world inhabited by innocence, care, love, smiles and tears with situations and scenes that tug one's heart along the way!And while feeling kind of nice and touched, Basu lingers (at the back of the mind) with one hoping that this one should be original (leave alone the inspired Chaplinisque slapstick - executed with ones own style and with desired results). As to why the looming Basu? Because whoever knows about his past record: gangster, metro, kites etc they were not original as such! In fact metro which he wrote had Billy Wilder's The Apartment taking up a chunk with the menon and ranaut clandestine meets! Or Kites which he must have easily directed as it was nothing short of dime a dozen C grade backstreet Hollywood fare - straight to video!So, while watching Barfi where one appreciates Basu's sincerity and depth from within the thought is: is it a copy of any film from any corner of the globe? As it is so rampant in Bollywood, where the makers are sheer lethargic in coming up with an original theme to be picked up by say France and Italy or even Iran!But despite all that one cant' help getting impressed! The sheer hard work along with the narrative is mesmerizing! And Barfi is a kind one just can't help recommending once you reach the intermission and text to friends, or back home with the effect to tell the world about it!To say it out loud that Ranbir is huggably excellent! And Priyanka is commendable in to- heck-with-the-world-i-will-do-this role, and good she did! Petite Ileana with expressive eyes and contained is just right!

And if you have bought this film it is by no means a bad purchase.The film centers on a deaf-mute whose mother died shortly after his birth by an accidental electrocution while switching on a radio. Actually his mother named him after the very radio that took her life. Very ironic indeed! Barfi is also a sweet confectionery from the Indian subcontinent. This parallels with the central character of the film who is sweet and child-like innocent at heart. Barfi's(Ranbir Kapoor) life revolves in getting into one scrape after another with the local police officer Sudhanshu Dutta (Saurabh Shukla).One day he spies the ravishing Shruti Ghosh (Ileana D'Cruz), who has just arrived in Darjeeling. He immediately and boldly professes his love to her. She explains that she is engaged to Ranjit Sengupta (Jisshu Sengupta), and is due to get married in three months.Shruti also falls in love with Barfi but her mother dissuades her from pursuing him because he could not take care of her with his disabilities and lack of money. Shruti takes her mother's advice, gets married, and moves to Kolkata, breaking all contact with Barfi.Will Barfi ever see Shruti again? It is for you to watch and find out.Verdict: this film is a mixture of some Charlie Chaplin comedy and seriousness. The character in this film is of a compulsive nature and actually never gave up on anything in his life - except for Shruti. After Shruti's marriage Barfi's life will be forever changed. The songs in the film are good as well as the photography and overall direction. I just felt that the movie suffered in the fact that a totally useless character - that of Jhilmil(Priyanka Chopra) was added to the film which lets the whole film down.

Barfi! will leave you spellbound; stunning visuals, fantastic sets, mellifluous music and perhaps most of all, innocence of Barfi and Jhilmil. All this unites to give you some magical moments to cherish. Director/writer Anurag Basu has to be mentioned specifically. It is rarely seen in Bollywood that a film is made with such care and passion. It was as if he thought out each and every shot before filming it and the execution was top notch, resulting in a magnificently polished film. Ya, the plot may not have been the most novel but Basu showed that inspired works can stand out on their own. You might not shine at the Oscars Basu but you definitely opened a new path for the Box-office hungry Bollywood.The cast was amazing; Ileana's performance was superb as the Bengali Bou (wife) and looked stunning too ;). Supporting casts like the sub- inspector brought much life to the film. There's not much too say about Ranbir and Priyanka but Awesome!On the whole, if you're looking for a Salman or Ajay no-brainer, then you might end up sleeping half way through Barfi!. But if you went to the hall or put in the DVD or turn your TV on for some majestic experience, Barfi will have something up his sleeve to keep you entertained for many days to come.",

Or as itself declared in the movie \"ek bakwaas jasoosi novel!\" Doesn't Move, doesn't Engage, doesn't Entertain! Frankly it does nothing in its never-ending running time.Why do they make such films? Who story-boards them? Who and why mounts them, sanction them? Why do production houses back it? Why do actors get super-excited about these futile exercises to exhibit their acting skills? It's a woeful waste of great resources \u2013 the cast and crew included- in such self-indulgent exercises. Just pencilling in a couple of physically disabled characters doesn't really qualify for great cinema. Barfi! for most part of it comes across as a contrived and manipulative effort, trying too hard to be too cute.Dear Ranbir Kapoor, we have seen enough of your range as a powerhouse performer. Wake Up Sid, Rajneeti, Rocket Singh, Rockstar, Barfi!...phew! Yes, my friend, you are an actor par excellence, the new kid on the block, the most promising newcomer\u0085and all that jazz! But it's time we move beyond this audition show-reel of yours and get into some real movies. It's time you emerge from the 'most-promising' category and actually deliver on those promises. Some real seeti-maar and in your Rockstar-lingo, some real palang-tod entertainment! The larger than life Khan-Akki-Devgn stuff. Or if that's too much to ask for, at least some frothy breezy romance of the Saif variety.OK, fair enough. Even if we take off the entertainment bit and start looking at Barfi! as an artistic-beautiful work, it doesn't really cut much ice (much Barf in this case). The direction is too flawed, and fails miserably in trying to be too intellectual, too layered. The director Anurag Basu continues to suffer from the 'Kites' hangover and assumes a back-and-forth narrative to be a great technique for great movies. It didn't work for Kites. And it most definitely won't for Barfi! either.The thriller bit doesn't work. The physical disability of the lead couple appears to be too force-fitted. And finally, the end-product is a confused exercise that seems to be based out of a neverland. It goes from nowhere to nowhere. All the characters and situations come across as cardboard cut-outs, caricaturish. As if everyone out there was trying to impress (look I can act, look I can direct) rather than express.Sorry, I can't be a pseudo-intellectual and praise this so-called masterpiece, when I was dozing off throughout this yawn-inducing Barfi! Three thumbs down for this torture \u2013 for the movie, for the director and for myself for listening to fake glowing reviews! The only redeeming feature \u2013 a superb 'Picchar shuru!' song at the start of the movie.",

It could easily have lapsed into a tear-jerking melodrama but has managed to remain a refreshing story of living life to the hilt. I think the similarity lies in the absolute positivity in their outlook and the lack of needless drama. The story revolves around three characters, two of whom are differently abled. And the beauty of the film lies entirely in the fact that it is NOT about the sadness in their lives. It is about acceptance, love, friendship and that there are no boundaries and no challenges when we connect with a person. Not preachy, not \"holier-than-thou\", it makes you realise that relationships don't always need words. And it is humorous. Ranbir Kapoor emotes effortlessly without words yet touches everyone. An adorable prankster, it is impossible not to fall in love with him. Definitely a huge chunk (not just a chip) of the various old blocks in his lineage. Ileana is beautiful and has managed to hold her own. Priyanka is exceptional as Jhilmil \u2013especially when she portrays her possessiveness for Barfi.The film is special for its joie-de-vivre and poignancy.",

Some great acting by all the three characters, Ranbir Ileana and Priyanka. Anurag basu did one hell of a job of making a complex story being told with such ease. It's the kinda movie that makes you believe in yourself and regardless of how people and society perceives you, very inspirational indeed. The standout scene was the sad proposal cum heartbreak of Barfi at Shruti's home. 5 minutes of pure brilliance both acting and screenplay wise. Reminded me of the outstanding performance by Nana Patekar in Khamoshi, the musical. Now that's some benchmark to match and Ranbir Kapoor did do it in that particular scene. 9.5/10.

            "content": "Barfi!, directed by Anurag Basu is undoubtedly one of the best and intelligent films to be churned out in a long time. Accepting oneself with all shortcomings, loving each other and smiling your way all the way up to the finish line - this is how one can describe Barfi! It's a sweet, charming, but complex tale told simply and smartly. It's a story coming straight from the heart and goes straight to the heart.Rising to the challenge are the three lead players, Ranbir Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra and Ileana D'Cruz.With Barfi! Ranbir elevates himself to the status of a seasoned actor slipping effortlessly into the skin of the character and giving a performance that simply leaves one stunned. Without a single dialogue (if you don't count 'Barfi!' as a dialogue), Ranbir masterfully smiles through his pain, gives cops a chase through town and frets over his lovers.Priyanka Chopra as Jhilmil needs a standing ovation too! In a short span, Priyanka has proved her mettle as an actress. She moves one step further this time with her convulsive, erratic body language and a highly expressive face.Ileana D'Cruz has already proved her acting abilities in the South. In Barfi!, Ileana looks beautiful,confident and comfortable in her own space. She enacts her part with utmost conviction. She portrays a girl who can't follow her heart, and when she learns to, it's too late.Saurabh Shukla as police sub-inspector with his witty dialogues, Ashish Vidyarthi as Jhilmil's father, Rupa Ganguly as Shruti's mother and Jishu Sengupta are also very good.As for Basu, in his earlier films 'Gangster - A Love Story' and 'Life... In A Metro', he proved himself a maestro of the inner life. 'Barfi!' too is shot on location within the hearts of the characters. It's difficult to have two disabled characters and not portray their stereotype or make the audience feel pity for them. But Anurag Basu does it skillfully with the script and story. He builds the characters so finely that you come to love each and every one of them by the end of the movie. Filled with positivity, Barfi hails the 'never-say-die' spirit of human beings and show us the ray of hope through the dark clouds. Barfi! takes to a non linear story-telling oscillating between the past and present, unfurling through series of evocative flashbacks. The major strength of the film comes with its narrative. It doesn't give away the entire plot in one go and unfurls the story little by little keeping you glued to the proceedings. It does take you a few initial minutes to get used to the poetic pace of the story and once you get settled you are taken on a magical ride. It's a movie which celebrates one of the most prized feelings of each human being: the joy of being loved, through a story of people who could have easily decided not to embrace it. This movie will remain a gem etched in the history of Indian Cinema. Music by Pritam is brilliant and so is the cinematography by Ravi Varman. The scenic beauty of Darjeeling is captured beautifully and you become a part of their world.To sum it up, Barfi is an emotionally stirring yet joyous ride that will make you fall in love with love and life. It is a cinematic tour-de-force one shouldn't miss, as Barfi! celebrates life. A must watch for one and all!",

            "review_title": "Barfi is rare to come by",
            "content": "Sometime around 2 months back when I first caught glimpse of Ranbir Kapoor starrer Barfi, I was captivated and overwhelmed by the colours and feel that 3 minute video exuded. Albeit harbouring obvious cautious about the movie, I was convinced of it's uniqueness and message. I never considered Anurag basu a ordinary director, hoping onto any big budget movies with high on the payroll scale star cast. Even when Kites made it to the theatres I was pleasantly pleased by it's outcome. For me his movies put forth the more distinct human relationship to the fore. Barfi involves 3 primary lead characters namely Barfi \u2013 a mute chap going about life like there's no tomorrow, Shruti \u2013 as a Bengali girl who falls in love with Barfi but her relevance on her mother weighs over her aptness in making decision related to heart, Jhillmil \u2013 autistic, insecure girl and compatriot to Barfi for most part of the movie. One can sense the ubiquitous vividness when any two of these makes their presence together on screen. At first it all seems surreal with the mannerisms and the look of it, but then the charm of Barfi starts to evolve with the Chaplin-sque ways, with the smiles and with the heartbreaks. The humour in the movie is intelligent although not original. The scene where Barfi first sees Shruti, the proposal letter to Shruti's parents scene, robbery scene, lamp post cutting etc are some of the scenes where one is left overwhelmed. The intermittent flashbacks and flash forwards are very well incorporated and ones gets the feeling of travelling through an era. Although the movie is complete package of fun, drama and superb acting, it overplays some aspects of movie-making. Like the music which I enjoyed swooning too, gets played every second scene making it repetitive and monotonous. Also the length of the movie is quite a worry for director who had squeezed a movie like Life in a Metro in under 2 hours. Frankly speaking I prayed the movie stopped after 2h20m because it was stretching too far. Sometimes the pranks and the antics of Barfi seem overplayed evidently contributing to length factor.The setting of the movie in Darjeeling and Kolkata helps amply in getting the correct feel of the plot and what the makers had to convey. Not to mention the toy train seeing after a long time (Parineeta I guess).Ranbir Kapoor seem to cross every string of imagination every time he takes a movie project. Most of his films start from the same pole, a quirky guy who's chasing girls, blowing kisses in air, he drinks and then the characters start to develop taking their own paths. It's in this movies that he excels in doing what he does best, not be a stereotype like others. Ranbir instils such life and charm into the character that it is difficult to imagine any other actor doing it. Being an admirer of Ileana D'cruz for talents other than acting, I have been quite satisfied with the way she played Shruti. She carried the role with grace and without stealing from the books of Hema Malini or Sharmila Tagore. Priyanka Chopra playing Jhillmil is the icing on the cake, her well played mannerisms of autistic girl and far more convincing, and her rapport with RK is truly a plus for the movie. She has the most impressive list of female oriented movies in recent years and that I the prime reason she played the part more proficiently. Saurabh Shukla playing the grouchy yet funny Police officer is a treat to enjoy.Such movie are very rare to come by and even if they do you wouldn't get to admire the skills and humour with which it is handled. It's a must catch from me.",

In due course, he falls in love with a young woman who in turn is engaged to be married soon. Complications get compounded with the arrival of a differently-abled woman into the scheme of things. Heartbreaks, emotional roller-coasters and chases follow.Ranbir Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra play their parts with great competency and control. Ileana D'Cruz, Rupa Ganguly, Saurabh Shukla do justice to their characters as well. The soundtrack brings out the joyous spirit of Barfi to the tee.Since its release, stories began pouring in about how sequences and patterns were inspired (and much stronger verbs) from sources known and unknown, famous and less famous. What hurt me personally was the fact that not just content-wise but also style-wise, the film seemed to be drawing inspirations from elsewhere. However, the beautiful compilation of these themes and threads required original work and the wonderful composition of sights (and some sounds) and this was impressively done.The second major criticism leveled against Barfi was its seemingly 'extra sweetness' \u2013 that here was a tale sugar coated so extravagantly that it glossed over the harsh realities of the lives of individuals differently-abled for an easy viewing experience of the multiplex audiences. Well, as for me, I can say this: I enjoyed Barfi immensely, I enjoyed the performances, the music and yes, I bought the melodrama. Yes, there was melodrama. And when I heard and read this point being harped later, I realized there may have been that extra sugar cube slipped in. But does it really matter? A piece of art's value lies in the emotions it is able to stir up in us. Barfi never promised to deliver a message for free or invoke strong 'calls to action'. Yes, there was an unsaid bond \u2013 that it would entertain. I think it lived up to that. The protagonists portrayed here may be rare outside the reel world, but it leaves one wondering that this spirit exists somewhere at least in the real world, a spirit that cares little for physical limitations. And this was Barfi's single biggest achievement: that its collage made of borrowed pieces had an identity of its whole that was more than the sum of its parts.So: Well done Team Barfi!",

It had Chaplinesque chase sequences, but melodrama in places. But just a few minutes later, I realized that yes, it was a mix of extremes - it was a no holds barred slapstick, but it dealt with serious issues like death and murder, but it worked surprisingly well. It talks about the adventures/ mishaps surrounding the life of Barfi, a happy-go- lucky guy who lives in Darjeeling, trying to live a pleasant and cheerful life despite being handicapped from birth (he is a deaf mute); how he faces love, financial problems, and being chased around by bungling cops for an assortment of crimes.Clear inspirations from Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton (with some sequences directly taken from the classic oldies). I also recognized some work from Jackie Chan, but since Jackie himself was always inspired by the early Hollywood comedies, I guess overall, the tribute was to the black and white movie era.They have also used the recurring gag of actual musicians in key scenes playing the movie's background score from 'There's something about Mary'.It was a silent era movie set in the modern times, like Kamal Hassan's old 'Pushpak'. While 'Pushpak' offered no reason for the silence it projected, 'Barfi!' stays largely silent because the central character is a deaf mute, which is integral to the plot and most of the comedy sequences.Priyanka Chopra stars as the autistic girl from a rich family who gets tangled in Barfi's life. The first few minutes of her appearance, I felt she was trying out a bad imitation of Dustin Hoffman's 'Rain Man'. Unsuccessfully. (Of course, unsuccessfully. Rain Man remains untouchable) But later on, her sequences were better, and felt more natural.The key to the movie's success is Ranbir Kapoor. I always pegged him for a decent actor, but with this movie, he has proved himself to be among the best. The way he handled conversations in the movie was truly astounding. He didn't use the standard deaf mute sign language, but preferred to communicate via gestures that anybody could understand. And he did it in such a way that I don't think there's a single sentence or sentiment that could have been missed by the audience throughout the movie. Also, his unspoken dialogs were done in the right pace; conversations did not seem belabored, stretched, delayed or out of place. He even managed to bring in the right tone of the dialogs throughout the movie. It was masterfully done.All things considered, I would give the movie 9 out of 10 stars.",

            "content": "BARFI (3.5 stars): Brilliant performances and great content with respect to script,screenplay and cinematography, makes BARFI sweet. A movie which critics will overrate and masses will underrate :-). Though for each MOVIE lover its pure good cinema!A Barfi which will definitely give you sweet-mushy feeling and will melt with full aroma as soon as (IF) it enters your heart!Ranbir Kapoor just rises few more steps up, WOW, what a amazing body of work he has in a very short time. The comical-Charlie style scenes were stellar in every way. He is a complete actor PERIOD. Priyanka deserves a SALUTE for this performance, surely a growth and showcase of her ability to groom acting talent. Also Illeana made a very impressive debut in Hindi cinema, she delivers completely what the character required, commendable. Without doubt, Extra sweetness was provided by veteran and class apart actor \u2013 Sourabh Shukla. Much like Anu Kapoor in Vicky donor, after a long time seen Mr Shukla in a great role!!!! The half star is just for the tinkling nuances provided by Sourabh-Ranveer comic scene.Anurag Basu is the master of the ship and great to have him up in the list of amazing directors, like Anurag Kashyap, Imtiaz Ali, Dibankar etc....In essence it is a story of love's free-flowing nature and its true spirit \u2013 non-judgmental compassion, woven greatly in two well intermingled love stories garnished with a strong thrilling Tadka. The statement of the movie for me was - \"People with different abilities should be seen as normal people, lets not stereotype\" as well as - \"Love is a beautiful place to be in and it can only remain magical till the time both have pure compassion without question.\" - \"Love is kept never controlled.\"Must praise the way disabilities are marginalized. Only other movie i could recollect was \"Koshish\" which had amazing performances by Sanjeev Kumar and Jaya Bahaduri. (It really annoy me at times when the moment leads characters are noticed with disabilities, people start generalizing. I heard, OH this is no where near BLACK, come on, 1st of all, no two movie are comparable. and in this case the entire dimension and zone of movie was different.) It's not about TRIUMPH over ones disability but just sheer portrayal of phenomena - LOVE.Something which deserves mention is that, how maturely, magically and in unabashed way, today's directors are bringing such freshness and newness to AGELESS zone of LOVE STORIES.Personally, I reiterated the question to self, Does this love exist and if yes, Kahin Dikta Kyun Nahin.Best line and kind of extract of the movie could be \"Usne Pyar Karne Se Pehle Bhi Nahin Socha AUR Pyar Hone Ke Badd Bhi.\" (something like this.)Yes the movie has some shortcoming, one very noticeable is the pace and extra length especially in the 2nd half. Still, nothing criminal against cinema :-).",

Music compliments the camera work equally, though, slight influence of 'Amelie' in it can't be denied. Through some of the scenes, director seem to be paying homage to some great works of cinema, e.g., 'City Lights'.Ileana couldn't have wished for a better launch pad in Bollywood (I believe it is her first). Priyanka Chopra's research/effort for portraying the character of an autistic is quite evident in her body language. And, best of them all is indeed Ranbir Kapoor with his Chaplinesque antics! First half is fantastic imparting loads of vitality and energy, but second half seemed a bit dragging with slight overdose of music and abstract shots. The length of the film and little too much melodrama, for my liking, will keep me from a re-watch. All in all, a must watch experience.7.5/10",

            "content": "'Barfi' is a very rare Bollywood film. It needed a very passionate director and an extremely committed cast and scored on both fronts. The script is outstanding and it would be criminal to not say so. The humor and the dialogues are so well fitting and prepares you for the joyride.'Barfi' is the name of a deaf mute boy living in Darjeeling and also the story of his 'sunny side up' view of life. It chose to primarily treat differently abled people as regular people and weave a beautiful tale with some outstanding moments. Their 'disability' is NOT the story but the story will make you forget their vulnerability and appreciate the characters they are. Its treads very far from the clich\u00e9d view of differently abled people.Ranbir's Charlie Chaplin influenced 'Barfi' is the core of film. He's tugging at the foot of destiny with such a performance that will remind you of Raj Kapoor. The Kapoor clan can be proud. Priyanka Chopra left me bewildered and I still am gripping to terms with her performance. I dare not say its bad, it was way good but maybe it was so different from the PC that we all know and if that's the case, then its full points to her as an actor. Ileana was refreshing and just right; what a debut to have? The cast was outstanding. Each performing just right and Anurag Basu deserves some beautiful bouquets just for that. I'd specially mention the effortless performance of Saurabh Shukhla as the policeman.When you have your lead being a deaf mute, you tend to heavily rely on music to showcase the story and Pritam has beaten himself to give life to this movie. What really works for 'Barfi' is the excellent background score. I wished it were a tone lighter but it has held the weave and tugs at your heart strings.Ravi Varman's visuals were very fresh and crisp. You get to see beautiful and stunning views of Darjeeling and also Kolkata. The sets were equally impressive. There's something about 'Barfi' which leaves you speechless and that seems a small problem when you happened to write a review. Anurag Basu, take a bow!",

Loads of emotions at the same time. If you are crying, in another moment you are laughing and you can't control it. Many heart touching moments.I don't know when I started crying along with them.

But as the movie goes on you are gripped in the plot and bang!!!! there comes a suspense (wont reveal anything more). As the story progresses you will be gripped. Direction (10/10) - People might say that some scenes are taken from Notebook, background score from Amelie, in different points of the movie there are 3 musicians appearing in the movie which resembles 3 owls of Rango :) (that's the first thing came into my mind) But you like the direction when it is effective.. and yes Anurag has made many scenes memorable. Simple scenes.. pauses... transitions(moving story to different time and coming back to the scene shown before and continue in other time) are used perfectly. For example there is a scene where all 3 characters are shown in a tram.. pretty normal.. but anurag keeps the frame..still.. and after 30 secs in the same scene you realize what all of them are feeling. Screenplay (9/10) - The transitions as I mentioned before are awesome. It would not have been effective if the story was shown in a progressive time frame. The benefit you get is.. the audience never gets bored. Though there was scope of improvement.Cinematography (11/10) - Kolkata and Darjeeling shown so beautifully that you will get mesmerized. The USP of direction was transitions and USP here is lights. Lights are used so very effectively that it reminded me of Titanic. As a cinematographer or photographer if you want to know how lights can effect the scene go ahead and learn from this movieActing (10/10) - I am speechless.... all characters are equally important and share adequate screen space. Ranbir has reached a new height which is very difficult for others to reach. Ileana is a bolloywood debutant but an experienced actor down south and she doesnot disappoint. Without Saurabh Shukla this story would have been incomplete, he is very experienced and gave one of his best performances. And here is one person which stands out... Priyanka... you will not believe that this girl was Miss World.... it was the best performance I have seen after Tom Hanks in Forrest gump (yes you need to see it to believe it)Music (11/10) - One of the finest music tracks... all songs are apt to the situation and so melodious that you will feel the song to continue forever. Pritam at his very best.Overall (10/10) - This is the only movie for which I gave 10/10 because it deserves it. Love is the most abstract thing in the world, it knows no boundary, no rules and that's what this movie is all about. Kudos Anurag!!! to keep alive an hope.. an hope that stories do exist in bolloywood :)Don't miss this",

            "content": "'Barfi'- not only a story of a deaf and dumb guy ,rather a story of a deaf and dumb guy who is smart and handsome like Ranbeer Kapoor.I seriously wish to appreciate this movie but few script and direction points don't let me find a cynosure.The movie seemed to struggled for a particular genre in yet every point.The basic underlying theme which the movie appeals from its initial hype i.e 'silence ,a language of Love' is one of the elements which has been totally expurgated and portrayed hastily.If you notice in the beginning scenes where 'Shruti' rewinds the days when she met Barfi, one moment he is shown cycling alone and the next scene he was with the girl in his vehicle, yes of course along with the background delivery of her non-impelling allocution about him. Now I'm just wondering one thing,if some director wants to express a theme or lets say a unique love story which has become a scuttlebutt pre-release, is not highlighted or exaggerated then what kind of a direction/screenplay is it? Since the time my ears striked this mute love concept in Bollywood, I was just expecting to witness the gradual sweet progress which would have ended in a sweet dalliance between a mute guy and a normal girl.But this ethereal attempt to showcast the punchline of the story has left the striker of hope petrified.Anyways taking the current lineup of the movie ,in which girl undoubtedly falls in love with a mute boy (by the 'taken as granted' obvious understanding of the audience) ,the serendipity goes with a fine labyrinth of flashbacks.Sometimes the twist of present and past is so instant that one wonders if its the ineffable emotions which needs to be focused or the director's trial to overshine!! And once you have accepted and settled in the flow of the movie, the contrived epiphany at last turns out to be more than expected.Apart from some police station dialgues or a guy or lady reciting flashback , the basic movie carry forwarders are a sequence of burlesque events catalyzed by a pertinent melody played in the background.The chaplinisque scenes are sometimes hilarious if the basic storyline is ignored. Now if I want to appreciate this movie I need to agree with some of director's policies: ONE, as mentioned earlier girl will anyhow fall in love with the mute guy.TWO, story of girl's mother's past will also turn out out to be quite similar so as to provide an example.Three, girl withholds her LOVE for 6 years , waiting for the hero to return back which revives her love again meeting the handsome guy.Seriously I'd have really appreciated had this movie been made with newcomers or unknown artists. Four, girl will agree to leave her husband after SIX years of marriage (mind it, 6 years not 6 months) and goes with the mute guy (of course cause' its TRUE love). Five, finally(and obviously) guy will find her missing second love in the end.And if one could hold on till the end, only thing which keeps on striking is, what's the director's exact fleck of appeal ,a mute love story ,or a hide seek tale or as self declared in the movie 'ghatiya jasoosi novel'?",

Everyday, as I listen to the songs from this amazingly beautiful movie, on the translucent screen of rain drops, I can see the whole movie in front of me and am in love again! Despite the fact that 80% of the movie is exclusive of dialogs, you will never for a moment feel you are missing something. The music, the screenplay and the expressions by the actors, especially Ranbhir, are enough to keep you engaged for the whole 3 hours. You will find yourself laughing at his silly-sweet antics, smiling at Priyanka's innocence and silently admiring the sheer beauty of the director's caliber of story-telling. And don't be surprised to find a tear trickle down your cheeks every now and then.And though there could have other better movies to send for the Oscar, this one's definitely worth a watch, maybe even two! :)",

Last but not the least, Priyanka was a treat to watch. She stands tall with Ranbeer, which was very rare with ranbeer's co-actresses before. For the Director, Anurag Basu, Its not his best. Gangster and Metro are his finest works till the date. He Lacked that story telling in Barfi. Though it is a remarkable milestone for him. Overall Barfi is was deliciously Awesome.",

Ranbir Kapoor (who plays a deaf & mute character) proves again, he is the best \"new\" actor by miles, and Priyanka Chopra is very believable as an autistic girl. The movie proves that you do not need constant blabbering to make a statement, sometimes silence is what is all required. The movie is inspired by Chaplinesque cinematography, and is better executed then any other Bollywood movie till date. What I really loved was the cinematography, the beautiful locales, and simplicity in the story.Its one those refreshingly \"feel good\" movie, which moves at leisurely pace. However, I do think that another 15 minutes of edition, would make it far more crisper. Oh and I feel Ranbir Kapoor in this movie is the closest match you can get with Kamal Hassan of Sadma, though Sadma was better Barfi is hauntingly close. A must watch movie.",

It came to notice that people who liked movie also criticized it for the only reason that some scenes were copied from other Hollywood movies. In my opinion this was wrong. As mentioned the decision to send Barfi to Oscars was wrong, but the negativity which came along was too much wrong. I myself totally support the idea of getting inspired and providing audience with something fresh, and by Fresh I mean fresh to particular audience is also fine.

            "content": "Barfi,a movie that touches your heart from the first reel and stays there long after the last reel have ended.A rare piece of cinema that brings tears and smile in our face and makes us feel how beautiful life is.After Life In A Metro was expected from the Bengali director but his Kites was a big disappointment.But here comes Anurag Basu with an offering no one can decline.He gave us a movie that can be cherished for a long time and the character Barfi will always be special.So here is Murphy(a.k.a Barfi),a deaf and dumb guy from the hills of Darjeeling who lives each day of his life to the fullest.He tries to bring happiness to everyone's life around him.With his charm and cuteness he easily woos Shruti(Illeana D'Cruz) who is new to the town and is already engaged to a rich guy in Kolkata.Then there is Jhilmil(Priyanka Chopra) an autistic girl who is not loved by her parents and is a childhood friend of Barfi.The moments Ranbir share with Jhilmil and Shruti makes the movie beautiful.Love is pure and the feeling can take birth within any person irrespective of who they are.That is why the special bond between Barfi and Jhilmil speaks of so much about the fact that you don't need to speak in order to feel love.The kissing scene between Ranbir and Shruti is one of my favourite moments in the movie.Without speaking much the three characters express so much about friendship,trust,love and care that you wonder why are dialogs even necessary in movies.Some scenes also reminds you of the legend of silent movies like Charlie Chaplin and the more recent Mr.Bean.Ranbir Kapoor as Barfi gives the performance of a lifetime and says so much without saying like in the scene where he expresses his pain after being rejected by Shruti.He is terrific and effortlessly good in every scene.Priyanka Chopra is brilliant as the autistic girl and should be appreciated for playing a role so different and difficult.Her scenes with Barfi are a treat to watch.Illeana gives able support to the other two and looks beautiful in cotton Sarees and Shankha Pola.In her scenes with Ranbir her eyes speaks so much you barely need to talk.The supporting cast is perfect and Saurabh Shukla stands out among them as the local cop who chased Barfi all his life.But the movie belongs as much to its stars as its belong to its Director.Anurag Basu made the film from his heart and it shows in every scene of the movie.He did not want anybody to sympathize for his characters but learn something from them.He has also used the music brilliantly and much like Life In A Metro three musicians are seen playing violin in many scenes in different locations of Darjeeling.The music and cinematography makes Barfi more delicious.The 70's of Kolkata is captured perfectly and the the Director paid quite attention to detailing.The landscapes of Darjeeling contribute in its own way to the beauty of the movie.You might wonder why I have mixed up the real and reel names of the stars while mentioning them.Cause the magical world of Barfi merges with the real world so outstandingly that you don't care about who is who.Happiness can be found in the smallest things and thats what Barfi tells us about.This movie will stay with you long after you leave the theatre.Go and grab a bite of this Barfi as soon as you can.",

What the director wants to tell the viewers nobody knows. After 20 or 30 minutes only it is got to understand about the speaking and hearing impairedness of the male lead.All actions of the male and female leads are nowhere related to any story, rather some story is framed to show the acting talent of the male and female leads.If the director or producer really believes that both the male and female leads are very talented actors(I am not saying that they are not talented actors, but in this movie there is no story which requires talent) it may be proved with a good story. But an attempt to show that they are very talented actors doesn't make a good story.I don't believe that this movie has any thing to be nominated for Oscar, and if it is sent, it is gunshot sure it will remain in the last of all entries.The reason for nominatin such movie could be a regional partiality for the director or others.",

With beautiful songs also.. It's a great achievement for a Hindi film about deaf, mute, and autistic characters to not wallow in sympathy or self-pity, let alone pipe a grandiose 'triumph of the human spirit' kinda message down our throats. Barfi...Ranbir Kapoor ad Barfi is the heart and soul of the movie. He is silly, vulnerable, likable and well-meaning rascal all rolled into one. Unapologetic about his handicap, his character is one of those rare ones in Hindi cinema which do not manipulate your emotions with over the top melodrama. His outburst at Ileana rejecting his proposal is one scene where the actor shows his class, clearly placing him miles ahead of the current crop of actors.Matching him scene to scene is Priyanka Chopra as Jhilmil, the autistic girl who finds love in Barfi. It is nothing less than a shock to see a mainstream glamorous actress get into a role like this with such sincerity. If Saat Khhon Maaf left one wanting a lot more from the actress, as Jhilmil, raises herself in stature and respect putting her in the list of the greats of Hindi cinema. Priyanka is awkward, slow in responses, possessive and innocent without being silly and making her handicap into a stereotype. Watching her is a simple delight, something one last experienced watching Rani in Black a while ago. The scene where she dreams of her wedding with Barfi is lyrical, visual poetry and asserts the growth in the actress craft. Both she and Ranbir complement each other in their scenes together,Ileana makes a confident debut putting in a spirited performance. It is to her credit that she chose a non-conventional path to a Hindi debut unlike her other southern contemporaries and she comes out with flying colors. Her biggest achievement is the fact that one remembers and registers her character despite two power packed performances by Ranbir and Priyanka.",

Very rarely, do you see a movie, which ends with an applause, a round of cheer by almost everyone present (Not the, Sunny Deol or Salman Khan types). Barfi!, for one, is a part of that privileged genre. Yes, he is deaf and dumb, she is autistic, but the equation they share is unparalleled. Already enough has been said and written about the classic roles essayed by versatile Ranbir, gutsy Priyanka and beautiful Ileana (I loved her Bong Bahu look!), and of course the vision of craft master Anurag Basu (Yes, the same guy who made Kites), but I can't help writing even more. There are moments which leave you smiling, which leaves your eyes moist, but in the end this movie makes you happy!How a person riddled with so many troubles manages to stay happy and give away his signature smile even in the worst of circumstances, makes you forget your miseries. I know, it might sound a bit cheesy, but yes, that's the effect it has! They deserve all the accolades and the appreciation they are getting, and the audience are loving it. What I hope is, this movie goes on to be a mega hit, just like the Singhams' and Ek Tha Tigers' and the BodyGuards',(in fact it deserves to be much bigger than those), but as I write this I know this is not going to be. If it does, it will certainly motivate the directors, and more importantly the producers to invest in such scripts, the 'hatke' one's, not the so called mainstream cinema. Although there has been a lot of such films making waves (along with money) in the recent past, the likes of Kahaani, Vicky Donor, Wasseypur topping the list. Succinctly I would say this is impeccable cinema, completely Hollywood material. (May be I am overrating it, but then that's what I feel!)Barfi might give away some traces of Charlie Chaplin, Mr. Beans, or Raj Kapoor but then what matters is, it's simplicity and silence subtly manages to tickle you and touch 'that' corner in your heart! P.S: Darjeeling is my favorite hill station, and the Chhau Dance sequence was terrific. And yes, I hoped to see the 'Fatafati' number in the end, but alas!",

            "content": "Lot of rave reviews on the movie, but I found it at best \" OK/good\".. not awesome or very good... One reason is - the inspirations or copying are little blatant. Like lead character mimicking scenes and body language of Charlie Chaplin and movies. Number of plots are straight lifts from \"Sympathy to Mr. Vengeanace\" the Korean movie.. One scene from \"Notebook\" and with this trend, I am sure few more \"inspirations\" will be evident - albeit have to look through few more world movies... But should give credit to the director for making these ideas woven well into a linear story.. The point is if you see these \"inspirations\" while watching, along with little predictable story-line, then you can't watch it with the interest, emotion and intrigue that are normally attached with awesome movie \"watching\". So for me, it made a OK watch with few smiles on some funny scenes and few smiles on the copied ideas - but strictly no other emotion evoking experience.Some more inspirations as read in various articles - benny & joon, Korean film oasis, mr. Beans holiday, project A, cops, Mr. Nobody, black cat white cat, Swedish news paper advert, the goonies, fried green tomatoes... Phew..",

I'm just out of my adjectives!!! Ranbir was absolutely brilliant too. Until Priyanka came to the scene, he was blowing it up. And then Priyanka made it Grand! And together, they created one of the Best movies on the earth. Ileana is beautiful and she performed nice too. As Priyanka and Ranbir will take away all the credits, she will not be mentioned that much. But she was also mesmerizing. Anurag Basu, the director, showd some guts to draw his dream picture and let it not go away to be a lush bollywoody flick. Kudos to him. More to mention, I was also amazed how beautifully Ranbir imitated Charlie Chaplin's trademark shots! In total, Barfi! is outrageously beautiful! A full 5.00 out of 5.00 for this piece of art!!",

Ileana D'\u00e7ruz made a mark with her Hindi debut and will go places!!!Another reason to watch Barfi is its fabulous cinematography and mesmerizing music!! Two thumbs-up for that!!Storyline was however a weakling over here with unnecessary addition of \"murder mystery\" plot to it which is not as interesting as meant to be.(-1 there)Nonetheless Do watch this movie which will touch your heart and will make you fall in love with life and change your perspective about it!!!Ranbir and Ileana excellent but barfi is priyanka's film all the way!!",

Every movement seems like a glide over ice, the visual so calm and fresh, the music so breezy and trans like more like in french films. The accordion is used so breathtakingly well. Pritam has shown what he is actually capable of, he should stick to doing so rather than make cast-copies from other languages.Cinematography is just stunning, frames with such love and crispness. I have been wanting to go to Bengal for sometime, and now moreso after seeing the beautiful canvas shown in the movie.The Acting by Ranbir is nothing short of brilliant. So is Priyanka's who plays an autistic child, with such conviction that you would wonder was she actually a fashion queen before? All other characters involved in the movie have been played very well to the character's requirements. It may have its cartoon type moments, but the characters involved are such that it is entitled to be so.Not often are you lucky enough to have seen such movies in your lifetime, so if you get a chance to watch it, please go and do so.Director: Anurag BasuMusic: PritamCinematographer: S Ravi VarmanTrailer:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZxrao3zou4",

Originality: Many of the scenes are copied from various movies. So, the great sequences are not original \u2013 rather they are picked and stitched in the movie (very well stitched though). Scenes copied from:i. Charlie Chaplin - The Adventurerii. Charlie Chaplin - City Lightsiii. The Notebookiv. Singin' in the Rainv. Buster Keaton's CopsMusic is also inspired from Amelie.2. Perfection: There are many technical issues as well in the movie which should have been avoided. For example, the age proportions of different characters were different in different times. If you take the police officer \u2013 he was not so old in last age but Barfi was too old. The makeup of Shruti in old age was not that good. There are many other technical faults as well.",

Although, he is no \"khan\" but that's a boon for him. I entered the Theater with a trauma of \"Ek Tha Tiger\", thinking that this movie might lead the expectations. Hall is jam-packed, people whispering their own reviews, girls starving for Ranbir, boys hooting for Ileana and between this hustle and bustle, movie begins. And it takes you away from the very first appearance of that song \"Picture Shuru\". The story never leaves you. Although you keep on guessing what will happen next, but you're proved wrong in the end. People compared Ranbir's performance with Chaplin and his Grand father, Raj Kapoor, but let me clear out, Ranbir is a part of their clan now. Kudos! The songs leaves you with smiley tears, Ranbir-Ileana-Priyanka's performances leaves you speechless, stunned, numb. The bitter-sweet relationships of these three beautiful young characters, Murphi aka Barfi (Ranbir Kapoor), Shruti (Ileana D'cruz) and Jhilmil (Priyanka Chopra) will not bore you out. You won't ask for an Intermission too. It will force you to say \"What a brilliantly fantabulous piece of work\". A movie for all.

Despite its fresh looks it lacks originality. it's heavily inspired from Charlie Chaplin movies and many of the scenes are directly copied from his movies. But I could not have a laugh at it although kids might find them comic. Movie is shot at descent locations in Indian hills in matching weather conditions. But the plot has many incidents which try to add humor quotient but fail miserably. With same story, one could have made a dramatic masterpiece with lot of emotions but writer and director chose otherwise. Coming to performances, Ranbir Kapoor has done justice to his character with descent performance, but at times it has too much caricature. Ileana looks pretty and acts well. the best performance however comes from Priyanka Chopra, she plays mentally challenged dumb girl. Her expressions are perfect for such a character and she has made it look unbelievably simple. I could not stop myself comparing her performance to Rani Mukherji's in Black, although Rani is one of my all time favorite, I have to say, Priyanka beats her hands down here. Overall Barfi is one time watch with boring first half which shapes up in second half. you can definitely watch it for Priyanka.",

In the divine settings of Darjeeling, in its narrow streets and alleyways, the ubiquitous rail lines circuiting all over the beautiful hill station and in the hearts of the simple minded residents (lucky them!), this movie had a feel good quality that leaves our heart warm and mellow. Plus, I must say, what use is a beauty if not properly captured on a photographic film? Great job done by the cinematographers!! But hadn't it been due to the stellar performances of Ranbir Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra, this movie, inspite of the picturesque settings, might have been bland and lackluster. A poignant portrayal of an autistic girl by Priyanka Chopra, I must say kudos to her acting acumen because no other actress worthy of her salt might have succeeded in doing what she had achieved. Ranbir (\"Barfi!\") Kapoor a.k.a. Raj Kapoor, a.k.a. Mr. Bean, achieves through his silence what the gun toting, expletive spewing and loudly guffawing protagonists (be it Salman Kan or Akshay Kumar) of Southern Replicas could not achieve - merit in their performance. Even the newbie Ileana D' Cruz fits in the shoes of Shruti Sengupta quite naturally. She is here to stay in Bollywood. But everything hinges on the shoulders of the puppeteer to see through the successful execution of the act, and to use the banal phrase, Anurag Basu (Director/Writer) is a dab hand at it! Revolving around three different timelines, Anurag Basu has succeeded in making this story seamless, which if not handled properly might have seen troubles sprouting out from every nook and cranny. Well, I won't reveal the storyline. I even hope that you won't open Wikipedia to check out the story. Because as Alfred Hitchcock said, \"There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it.\" Of course, he meant it for spine chillers, but the message remains validated. Though slowing down a wee bit in the second half, this movie is indeed a success, as according to me it has succeeded what it has endeavored to portray, that 'Love is unadulterated, 100% pure.'",

And Jhilmil, my favorite character is played very well by Priyanka Chopra Jonas. Jhilmil is an autistic girl residing in cottage like hostel Muskaan and his Bengali father wants her to be with him in order to con out money from his family through her. Arijit Singh has played a tuneful song Phir Le Aya Dil in which three of the characters has been shown together enjoying their life. Happily. A perfect song of successful love triangle.

            "content": "Being a strong critic of Bollywood Cinema, Barfi! strikes me like a wave of refreshment. A very positive attitude, while crafting this kind of cinematic experience, is required, and the team of Barfi did it in its own unique flair. Aside from the effortless performances by all the actors, Anurag Basu has shown his true qualities: the notion of freedom in creating cinematic art. He, at this time perhaps, didn't aim at commercialization and produced a movie of this status. I believe when you go inside the theater expecting some art, all other crass movies but Burfi disappoint you. It is therefore, the success of Barfi lies in redefining the true meaning of Cinema and the experience associated with it. I grew up listening to people surrounding me that the old-age cinema used to be better than we happen to see today. I think I got the reason behind the saying earlier, and now Burfi marked its stamp on this legitimate reasoning. At that period of time, filmmakers believed in Cinema, not in money. They drew passion, motivation from the art itself. After all, art should be preserved in its true form, and with the likes of Barfi Anurag Basu, in my opinion, pays due homage to Cinematic art. There are references to the vintage movies of the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Italian Cinema which is light hearted in its core. Moreover, the movie didn't lake Bollywood taste, yet it tried to be indifferent towards the same--perhaps a positive aspect for it.Every scene in this movie craved for perfection; the team of barfi tried their best to keep it near perfect. Well, there is also scope of improvement in every thing, hence the case goes with Burfi too. It's length might be one area: if it had been shorter by 10-15 minutes, the movie would have been better than the present form. On the other hand, music was superb. Pritam shined and filled the movie with 70's aura.Overall, one should watch it for the love of cinematic art. Ranbir Kapoor seemed to have an eclectic taste and surely he reminds us of The Showman, Mr. Raj Kapoor. Priyanka Chopra did her part without having her noticed in this movie. You see only the characters in the movie. Illiana was truly amazing in her portrayal of Bengali housewife. Rest of the cast delivered what was required: neither more nor less.",

            "content": "Barfi- When someone makes a movie with lot of love, it shows. In Barfi, it shines and mesmerizes. I think few weeks ago I mentioned on this forum that long time Bollywood created a movie that makes your heart go mushy and achy. The ones that make you ask where has that kind of love gone? And With Barfi, I think the prayer was answered. As we have already read multiple reviews about it Barfi, lot of good and couple of average, hence I would be just brief about my thoughts here. 1. Many lump-in-throat moments. Not detailing where all to not to spoil for others who have not yet seen . But I was feeling so good every time a tear came in my eyes or my throat formed a lump. Long time since I got moved with a scene from Bollywood. 2. Ranbir can easily be crowned the typical romantic hero of these times who can deliver the innocence of selfless lover to the T (APKGK, Rockstar, Barfi) and you can't but help comparing this ordinary boyish charm with his ancestors Raj Kapoor and Shammi Kapur. And boy, he looks dishy in many scenes when he falls in love with EDC. 3. Priyanka lived her character of a \"Pure as a Dew Drop Jhilmil\" to perfection. Her eyes, gestures, whole personality oozed of innocence and uncorrupted waif. Hats off and serious competition to VB at Awards nights! 4. Ileana couldn't choose a better movie to debut in Bollywood and hopefully goes on to make it big. Coming to few things that I read in reviews and my thoughts on that: \u0095 Length of movie- Many ppl said it shud have been short by 30-40 mints or 1 hour, but I am not complaining. If people can sit through the likes of Joker, Ready, Body Guard, Jism 2 etc no one shall complain about a good movie being long which is nothing short of fresh air. I can understand director's dilemma here, when the movie is made with too much love and is about small slice of life moments, it's very difficult to cut any part of it without regrets. Even Life is Beautiful and Forrest Gump were 2+ hours instead of usual 1.5 hours of Hollywood standards and no complaints. \u0095 Songs and Cinematography \u2013 The look and sound of music took me back to the era of 1942-a Love Story and Kareeb. The same magical scenic surroundings and music that just swept you away on a long ride to dreamy romance and beauty of normal innocence of life. Full Marks to both. \u0095 Make up- While the 70s make up was great, the present day Elderly characters' get up left lot to be desired. Wish more effort could be put on that department. I would have no complaints if some other Senior Citizen actors would have played elderly Barfi/Jhilmil/Shruti. But this drawback is forgotten and forgiven quickly keeping in mind what good stuff you observed just now.",

            "content": "The movie begins with a leg-pulling jingle advising audience to settle down properly. Then begins a flashback story, there are two flashbacks actually. One by Shruti (Ileana D'cruz) and other by inspector (Saurabh Shukla). Story is set in Locales of Darjeeling and Kolkatta.The unconventional story of Barfi (Ranbir Kapoor) is told with a conventional panache. The tellers spell out his characteristic of enjoying every moment of life and living it to the maximum, despite of his shortcomings of not being able to speak or hear. The name \"Barfi\" was originally christened as \"Murphy\" after the radio-sets (carrying image of a cute baby) people used to have in 70s. But as Barfi himself could not speak his name, it sounded more like Barfi, the sweet.Jhilmil Singh (Priyanka Chopra) enters little late in the movie as a girl growing up with Autism and facing backlash from society.Story revolves around three youngsters who realise that love as a feeling cant be ignored or modified. No matter how they try to avoid Love, it comes back to them. How story steps out of ordinary is the harsh reality of the much touted 'second chance' people get in life. Story supports the second chance concept, however also emphasizes on the 'time' when you take/get it.There is a point towards the end when Shruti spells out her illusive dream of a love story where she ( epitomising her grandmother) will find Mr. Right and grow old with him. She compares her stand about Mr. Barfi with Jhilmil who unlike her did not put brain while getting involved with Barfi and continues to do so for the rest of her life.Ranbir and Priyanka have given their best performances ever. They seem to sink into the characters so well, especially Priyanka when she makes audiences forget what model actress she is. The supporting cast by Saurabh Shukla and Ashish Vidyarthi are stupendous. We wonder why Priyanka is virtually missing out in publicity posters, its definitely an Oscar performance by her as well as Ranbir. Ileana works her way out with the stills pretty well. All in all a very fulfilling experience. Full bang for the buck.",

After the movie, you do not remember story or scenes, only characters emotions. Every character is a portrayal of emotions, from Barfi to policeman. You do not realize the disability of lead pair, you only feel love for each other. For sure you will watch climax again and again.Though movie stands as a respectable film, some scenes were lifted from famous Charlie Chaplin comedies (Police door sliding scene, see-saw with ladder on wall, Barfi wakes up on inaugural statue scene).

It is touching to see that even invalids can have a life. They can fall in love and maintain it too! I liked the idea of couples \"dying\" together. It's very classic and the love story is not like the modern day definition of \"love\".One small drawback that I found is that the movie is very sluggish and slow. It is not a problem as enjoying the movie is more important! Very good movie! If you can't watch it in a theater, watch it on your computer at least! ;)",

I really don't get the hype and the 10/10 ratings by users. Have they ever seen a good movie? A movie is not good because of its effects . Its not good because the director includes too many random funny scenes which don't really advance the story. And its certainly not good when the few good scenes are actually copied(please don't even try to argue by saying \"inspired\") from several films.Its good because of the acting and an actual plot. Whatever \"plot\" was there it was so weak and felt like Anuruag just added it as an extra. I thought this movie would be emotional and about how handicapped people are treated and their struggles. Initially it felt like a comedy,then an adventure story, then a love story and towards the end a mystery. At times I even wondered if this film was aimed at children. I believe the director himself had no clear idea what his film was supposed to be about. Now to the acting. Illeana and Ranbir were great.Priyanka's acting however seemed as if she was trying too hard and was not very comfortable in her role. Her constant blinking and eye twitching were just annoying,and it did not seem at all natural.I never felt emotional at any of the scenes nor connected with any of the characters. The movie as a whole was extremely boring and annoying. Forget about saving your money on movie tickets, don't even watch it on DVD or online for free.",

His acting keeps us laughing and also picks our emotional chord in some scenes. * Priyanka too acts really well, with her expressions and her body language conveys a thousand words when shown as a person with autism. We are very lucky to have an actress who can act among all the other actresses who can only strip. * Ileana was also good in her debut movie and her expressions added more flavor to the movie.* Saurabh shukla is too good.Overall message in the movie - Love only needs expression and you can be happy only with your true loveRating - 10/10",

The best part of the movie is the characters which have been played brilliantly. Ranbir Kapoor has once again showed how great actor he is in modern era. Whenever he said \"Burfii\"(the only word he can say), something tickled from inside. The one thing with \"Burfii\" the character is that, he never cries, never regrets and he holds positive attitude about life. I also liked the way he tests person faith in him. But, Priyanka Chopra with her fragility takes all the sympathy and love. It doesn't seem that you are actually seeing the glamorous Priyanka Chopra. Instead, you are completely involved with \"jhilmil\", the innocent girl. And something tickled again when she said \"Burfiiii\".The newcomer Illeana has done fabulous job as she portrays a character of confused beautiful woman in love. It would be unfair to Saurabh Shukla if I don't mention his name. He has played the character superbly and showed his class.But all the credit goes to Anurag Basu for creating and making such a beautiful story. The story telling is class and you can say this by seeing the first scene itself where an old man lifts himself, clicks his photograph and fell, simply beautiful.Must watch for cinema lovers who watch movies for acting and story telling.

            "content": "Somebody once quoted - \"Life through a child's eyes is the most precious way to live.\" This life is what Anurag Basu has visualized for us in Barfi, a film which teaches us to make the biggest decisions of life through heart and not through brain.Barfi is truly a director's movie. Though I cannot think of any actor other than Ranbir to play the subtle character of Barfi, I still claim that the movie belongs to Anurag Basu, the Bengali director who ignited our senses with the sensuous Murder. This movie reflects the rising graph of Basu who scintillated the Indian viewers with Murder and Gangster where emotions and personal vendetta played the lead roles. Post Gangster, he entered the world of parody where he showcased the hollow emotions of the fast paced metro dwellers in Life In Metro. His next venture was Kites which was a romantic thriller, a less experimented genre in Bollywood, was surrounded by more hype than substance. His latest move,Barfi, turns out to be the best out of his kitty which establishes himself as one of the most promising directors in Bollywood. The movie portrays Basu's spiritual and philosophical thought process which might have been a consequence of the life threatening leukemia in his life. His graduation is very evident in his movies.From loud emotions like anger and revenge, he moves to social sarcasm from where he tries out romance of the hearts to finally land up in a movie which explores personal philosophies. Now it would be very interesting to see what is Basu up to in his next movie.To talk about the movie - I know that lots and lots had been talked, praised and ridiculed about the movie. The movie got into the limelight by its heartwarming story-line, the non-linear-but-candid screenplay, wonderful music from Pritham and exceptional performances by its lead actors - Ranbir, Priyanka and Ileana. It also received some blunt criticism because of the allegations of copying scenes from foreign movies including those of Chaplin. However as far as I am concerned the movie fulfilled its purpose.The movie is all about three characters - Barfi (a deaf and mute guy who sees life through a child's eye), Shruti (the Bengali bubbly girl who strikes Brafi with her beautiful smile, played by Ileana) and Jhilmil (the autistic girl who loved and trusted Barfi beyond doubts, played by Priyanka). The whole story revolves around the emotional tangles which each character sets for the other and how they breaks it. The movie might have been inspired from some other theme and may not be labeled original. Nonetheless, the film succeeds to converse directly to the viewer's heart. There are some lovely scenes in the movie which make you fall in love with the characters. I would want to quote one sequence here - Barfi, after befriending with people, takes them to a place where there is a lamppost. The lamppost is built out of wood and is very fragile. Barfi will cut the lamppost at a particular angle and he clearly knows where it will fall. He then clasps his friends' hands and stand in front of the lamppost. His friends will get concerned and they will move away from Barfi fearing that the post may fall upon them. But Barfi remains still as he clearly knows at what length and angle the post will fall and it will not touch him. This is an exercise he does with all of his friends. It can be touted as a funny act from Barfi or one which tests his friends' trust in him. He chooses to leave Shruti and live with Jhilmil performing this simple act. When Shruti moves away from him after he cuts the post, Jhilmil allows him to clasp her hand and hold her firm. She believes in him and trusts him. She doesn't try to judge him while others do. Barfi tries to establish that love cannot be defined within the conventions of society. It shows that love is the language of hearts and transcends norms and customs to a world where purity and innocence dwells. There is no place for ego or prejudice in this world.To me, a movie succeeds if it remains in my mind at least for a day after watching it. Measuring Barfi in terms of that, I can easily say that this movie is more than a mere success. It is here to stay. (I regret of not watching Barfi in the cinemas. If I would have, then this review would have happened one year back.)",

            "content": "Rather than the thoughtless degraded comedy that Bollywood comes up with nowadays, 'Barfi!' is a slapstick story of small town 'mute and deaf' boy who comes of age and his innocence with which he views his world and the people around with a (kind of Woody Allen genre but not so perfect) blend of mystery. Barfi will not only steal your heart away but keep you wanting more by which time its starts drawing out in the latter half. The movie gets off as characters surrounding Barfi narrates his time line unfolding in an otherwise sleepy, misty town in Darjeeling. Barfi's antics invigorates the town and its people even if its not entirely in favor of protagonist.Ranbir Kapoor excels the dumb and deaf, cute, Barfi to perfection, and it would have hardly mattered to the audience that the whole movie was cut into pieces and shuffled together (director was trying to be innovative?Yikes!), as the audience goes into raptures of heartfelt laughter. Ranbir's youthful energy is infused into the story realm. Without Barfi's playful antics instilling the town with a soul of its own, she would be overwhelmed by the greed its people would go to any lengths for. Adding to the coziness of the viewer, the town ages into the present world along with Barfi. The audience is witnessed to the hippie, playfully shy town represented in the 1970's 'Murphy' radio billboard adverts giving way to present day underwear advertisements in shamelessly larger view of arriving city tourists. Almost equally well played, Priyanka Chopra leaves behind her flashy 'Fashion' wardrobe untouched this time as she plays a mentally retarded (by credits I realize she was playing an autistic kid), Jhilmil, who yearns for care and love after she's plucked from her institutional home to fulfill her Grandpa's last dying wish. After grandpa's death Jhilmil finds it hard to fit in her home and finds solace and unconditional love in an unassuming Barfi.The moments between Priyanka and Ranbir will melt the hearts of lady folk but don't quite stick by the end of the movie.Forget that you are reminded of Charlie Chaplin's antics (it should be taken as tribute rather.. to the King of Comedy) or you would do well not watch the copies from which Barfi is allegedly and ruthlessly taken from - Not seen for a long time in Bollywood, Barfi! will fill you with a heart-full of warmth and happiness and leave you smiling all the way home.Go watch 'Barfi!'...Be Barfi for a while.",

Priyanka Chopra is another surprise, who essays the role of a girl who suffers from psychiatric disabilities(autism), is another noteworthy performance.Illeana also impresses with her performance, but easily overshadowed by Priyanka and Ranbir.Supporting cast also don their roles with ease and help carry the storyline forward.Bottomline: A must watch movie and can be easily understood by people who cannot understand Hindi.

            "content": "I have not, in recent memory, seen a more beautiful, intelligent and original piece of work in Hindi cinema, save for 3 Idiots in 2009. When you walk into a cinema, you are looking to be entertained and that's what Barfi does surprisingly though you can walk in with all your good senses in tact (for a Bollywood movie yes!) as Barfi invites you to explore life , learn it's lessons, feel the pain and then know how to move on. You are shown how to laugh or to express love or sorrow or hurt in the face of cold indifference. The performances are brilliant, the cinematography is masterful and the directing lies at the heart of it all.No character is bigger than the movie and that's where Anurag Basu shines through. His craft ensures that the audience grasps the sheer irony of life which is expressed through performances yes, but also through depiction of sheer poverty, helplessness, losses and survival. No where in the movie do you realize that the movie is tethering you towards it's own conclusions. You don't realize that it's speaking to your subconscious mind and bringing to you beauty lost with images,sights,sounds,speech,experiences, which you take for granted may be a million times in a day. As the story unfolds, you indulge in a lost world of expressions and fearlessness and start to appreciate the many joys you choose to ignore on an everyday basis.I know I could find one tiny loose-end in one of the scenes but the movie is so hauntingly beautiful that it'd be a crime to even linger on \"finding flaws\". I do not think Barfi! could be outclassed in a few years to come. It stands chest-to-chest with some of the cinematic giants from the 80's and before, It is from the league of Aamir Khan and all those who'd be compared with Barfi! would deem it the highest privilege.Please watch it.",

After the movie ended you won't feel u missed the speech of Ranbir,a gem of an actor and best among the current lot in Bolywood.This boy emotes from his face so brilliant that you are in for a surprise for sure. In the end I would recommend this one film to everyone especially if you want to feel good about yourself,want to smile like when we were children..and I bet u will!!

Talk about Ranbeer Kapoor, he has grown so much within past few year that no can say that this boy has his debut in 2008, watching him doing comedy is like watching a motion pictures of Charlie Chaplin, he has performed so well that every performance is impossible to carry without his. other character who left a mark are Saurabh Shukla(Inspector) & Priyanka Chopra(Jhilmil) These two character never went under the cloud of Ranbeer, This movie had few mistakes and there are few scenes taken exactly from some movies, like the whole character of mother is taken from The Notebook, Her every scene is a part of that movie and is been played in same way no modifications had been done. The death scene in the end was also from the Notebook. few comic scenes are taken from Chaplin's earlier movies like Modern Times. thus have to give it 9 stars out of ten, but this movie is worth watching.",

The story keeps to guessing on what going to happen next - there are plenty of twist and turns to keep you entertained till the end.The characters played by Ranbir, Priyanka, Ileana and the Muskaan's caretaker Haradhan Bannerjee are full of life and will move you with their innocence.Parts of the screenplay takes inspiration from classics like Singing in the rain and Charlie Chaplin. Some of the comic scenes are so unpredictable that you will be in for a pleasant surprise! Years from now we are gonna look back and say that Barfi! was a real MASTERPIECE of our generation.

There is a saying that nothing can be perfect, but in this movie, I think everything was perfect. A beautiful love story, which has everything like happiness, emotions, sentiments. It will show us how to love, irrespective of being dumb, deaf, or abnormal. After wake up Sid, Rockstar etc, we know that Ranbir is a good actor. But, after seeing this, I feel that he is the Best. I was surprised by the performance of Priyanka chopra. My God, it was extra ordinary, I felt like she is really abnormal. It would be very bad if she didn't get a national award for this performance.

            "content": "Sometimes, when you least expect it, something comes along and touches you in a special way. Barfi is exactly that bolt out of the blue. Walking in, not sure what to expect, a comedy or an overdone dose of tear jerking tactics based on physical limitations - I came out happy to be proved wrong. While as a usual Virgo perfectionist, I could choose to pick holes in the story - I really think this movie went beyond the usual 5 point scale of greatness. Somehow reminds me of how sometimes we try and grade movies with the head rather than the heart. And like Robin Williams in Dead Poets Society - for today, lets rip out the page which grades poetry/movies on an x/y scale. Our hearts live on emotions and feelings and graphs don't really do those well. For me- Anurag Basu has created his masterpiece and shared it with us. He had me in tears at so many moments (and I can feel them coming back now as I think of some of them). The performances of Ranbir, Illeana and most of all Priyanka created an afternoon of magic for me which the ticket price will never justify! The tossing of the shoes in the air, Priyanka's calls of \"Brrfii\" and Illeana's always being there at Ranbir's weakest moments are just some of those. I loved the poignancy created by watching Ranbir getting Priyanka to say \"Namaste\" to Illeana, or Illeana's stopping when she heard Priyanka call out to Ranbir - even though she knew she was giving away all she wanted for his happiness, Priyanka's lying down near Ranbir at the end, Priyanka's passing Ranbir's loyalty test of the street lamp - all these were just moments which I couldn't help being touched by (even when I think of them as I write this now).The great strength of this movie was the fact that Basu chose to ignore the beaten track of using the character's limitations to build sympathy, but rather made them into characters who live a normal life and face the same challenges just as anyone else in the world. The narrative is lucid and takes us through the intermingling trail of their lives and decisions and leaves us asking of ourselves questions which perhaps we may more often choose to ignore rather than answer. The performances were spectacular by way of simplicity. Ranbir and Priyanka both ran the risk of overdoing the focus on their limitations, however they both emerge as characters who may well overshadow their other performances. Illeana was elegant and simple and brought the demands of society and actions under the same to the forth. Her performance was brilliant and an excellent support foil for Ranbir and Priyanka. To my mind, Priyanka was mind blowing. The usually glamorous girl in most roles has shown depth in her performance and I for one fell in love with \"Jhilmil\". Her role as an autistic was brilliantly done, the specialists may choose to find flaws with some aspects but I'm not one of them. Her wonder-struck looks and expressions of happiness throughout the movie had me completely spellbound. Ranbir again shows he has come of age and I look forward to him in many more roles off the usual commercial formula pieces. I am very sure his rendition of the smile creation with his hand will catch on in the next few days but more than that I do hope his approach to life and endless endeavors to create magical and happy moments is remembered. The support cast did just what was needed - to me it was perfectly orchestrated and for that Basu needs the entire credit. The packaging was excellent and made for brilliant cinematic viewing. All in all - if you are thinking about watching it, stop thinking and watch it - it could well be some of the best viewing moments of your life. It was for me. Barfi touched me in a very special manner, I hope it does the same for you.",

Although some scene seems to be copied from notebook, mr bean and charlie Chaplin but this movie is the first of it's kind in Bollywood and it's lot's better than that BS rowdy type movie.

The plot was awesome music was splendid. And the movie has the two side funny and sad. At the end people will hate irrespective of how good movie is if they are jealous of ranvir :).The conclusion is that the movie is about a man who spreads love and happiness.Ranvir and priyanka did a very stunning acting.

Hats off to Director Basu for giving this Gem Of A Movie :)Until I watched this movie, I really thought that Telugu Movie Eega will go through Oscar's screening, but now I feel this is undoubtedly best film to be selected due to its universal appeal.Director of Eega (Rajamouli and other nominated films) should be very proud that their film has competed and lost against such a brilliant movie.Ranbir : Wow!! Excellent performance. Tell me any other actor who could pull this off? His antics with his charismatic persona has perfectly suited this character. Lots of shades of his Grand Father(Raj Kapoor)Priyanka : Standing ovation :) Now I need to watch 'What's your Rashi' and '7 Khoon Maaf'.Ileana : Never saw her so beautiful.(No not even in Telugu Movies Pokiri and Kick) Yes, her eyes speaks more than her. Perfectly used by Basu. Thankgod, she used her own voice at least in this movie.Pritam : Superb Background score.Basu : Mind-blowing Screenplay. If you carefully observe, the entire story can be narrated in a linear fashion. But he cleverly used spaced, flashback(within flashback) style to generate interest in the audience. We saw this kind of screenplay in his 'Life In a Metro'Special Scenes for me: 1) Entire scenes in first half where Ranbir tries to impress Ileana. 2) Ranbir showing anger on Ileana for encouraging him to advance in their relationship even after engaged to other person 3) Entire journey between Ranbir and Priyanka 4) Introducing Priyanka to Ileana 5) Ileana accepting their true love 6) Ileana leaving her boundaries and traveling with Ranbir 7) Ranbir's anguish and finding Priyanka again 8) Ranbir's acting after knowing(from Ileana) that she is in Muskaan 9) Priyanka showing her possessiveness towards Ranbir to IleanaSpecial Mention : Cinematography by Ravi Varma",

What makes this movie a masterpiece is the high level of cinematography, the background music, the acting of Ranbir Kapoor and Priyanka. Priyanka had a glamorous image but she proved herself and Ranbir Kapoor did an excellent job. It becomes so difficult to maintain the typical Little Tramp image throughout the movie but Ranbir made it.The story of movie is also good. It is not focused on item songs for business interests only. In the end it is worth watching for people who have loved or are compassionate.",

The movie follows the adventures of Barfi ( Ranbir Kapoor) through his ups and downs in life filled with moments of laughter and sadness and more importantly ,love and romance.The movie is filled with such depth that each and every scene has a story to tell of itself and the movie altogether felt like many movies sewn together with its numerous flashbacks. The movie gives a wonderful message that love doesn't need to fit in the society's views of whats normal and whats abnormal. The locations are wonderful, the songs heart touching and the acting is fantabulous.Ranbir Kapoor plays the role of Barfi with finesse, He is surely the future of bollywood. His antics similar to the legendary Charlie Chaplin is sure to amuse the audience.Priyanka Chopra who appears sans making is just amazing to watch.She plays her role as the autistic Jhilmil with flawless perfection and kudos to Illeana D'cruz who is a telugu actress who played the role of Shruthi very well. Barfi is a modern masterpiece and should not be missed at all.Its a movie Bollywood should be proud of. A movie which tries something out of the tried and tested Bollywood formula. This one feels you leaving happy and warm.. why its almost like enjoying your home made barfi.",

OK, I read the existing reviews of this movie, and thought what the hell, I'll give it a try. That was a BIG mistake as this film is truly terrible. Bad direction, camera work, lighting, sound, acting and script. Sometimes you really have to wonder how these things get made when there are so many talented people trying to make it in the industry. This movie is an insult to from start to finish, and you have to question whether some of the other reviewers are involved with the movie in some way. Don't get me wrong, I love a low budget movie as much as the next guy, but it has to be good and this definitely is not. With so many other movies out there I'd give this a wide berth.

I truly believe, and I think everyone should respect each other opinions, that Barfi is one of the best movies I've ever seen, not only from India but from around the world. I'm not Indian, not even close to it, but I always had curiosity about movies from this beautiful country and since I watched the first one, I wasn't able to stop anymore. Now I even prefer to see a common bollywood movie than one the never ending repeatable, rarely original, Hollywood movies. At least you can count on great music or choreographies, even if the story is not that great. Ranbir Kapoor, no doubt, he his one of the great actors of this generation. I've never seen a film in which he didn't acted majestically and on which I didn't forgot by moments that I was seeing fiction. Technically, in my opinion, is supreme. The photography is magnificent. I just have two things to point to the movie. First is that, till the part Jhilmil went missing and Barfi got sad, I never thought that his feelings for her were more that a kind of brotherly love and never got a hint otherwise, honestly. The second thing is, I'm not criticizing Priyanka Chopras talent, because I didn't saw many of her movies, but I think her portrayal of the character was a fiasco... Her exaggerated \"tics\" were not even close to resembling to an autistic person, I saw more resemblances with Down syndrome or cerebral palsy, that caused a break on the verisimilitude of the story and made the love story look awkward. To be clear, I'm not questioning the kind of disability but how she portrayed that disability. Has I said before I don't know much about her acting, but if she is, like I've read recently, one of the best Indian actresses and one the best paid too, she has to do a better research on her characters first. In conclusion, I give 9 stars to the majority of the categories of the movie, except to Ms. Chopras performance that I give a 6.",

It's also the only film to have gotten a STANDING OVATION at the theater, and i saw all of them at the theater.The film is a gem of all types be it the the unique intro, or the first frame whose tenderness sets you up for the ride. A love story at its core, the movie is unique in that it showcases each person's love story on its own strength, separately yet intertwined and does so fantastically. It also holds out the promise of finding new love after losing while conceding that some memories will always be looked back upon with regret.Ranbir is brilliant, his performance the most heart moving since that of Aamir Khan and Darsheel in Taare Zameen Par. The extent to which he embodies Barfi, is a lifetime performance. Be it the spurned love,goofball and slapstick genius, or a man limited by his disability in two especially heart-wrenching scenes. His performances is truly worthy of being called a tribute to Charlie Chaplin and is really well supported by the music of this film which is pitch perfect in capturing the essence of this film. Ileana D'Cruz is the embodiment of what any Indian man would want his wife to look like, yet the way her character ends leaves you with a knot in your throat.And Priyanka. She absolutely steals the show all the way here. Each and every frame of hers is brilliant that it leaves you wondering why she's not mentioned along with Vidya Balan and Kareena more often in the list of female leads who can act and outperform anyone. To say anything else is to do injustice .Finally to Anurag Basu, you surely deserve an Oscar nomination for this work and for coming the way you did after Kites. Thank you for giving us a film which we kept returning to long after leaving the theater...so if you're feeling down or depressed or even if you aren't go for this. Or else you might just be left regretting.Go Barfi!",

This in true sense expresses love without any language, caste, creed or color \u2013Selfless with heart; an impeccable cinema worth watching with your beloved, friends and family. Performance-Wise: Ranbir Kapoor is a fearless actor & he presents Barfi superbly. The versatile actor lives the utterly lovable protagonist to the fullest. Amongst Ranbir's Best Performances! Priyanka Chopra is another topper. She plays the easy to love autistic character matchlessly. Ileana D'Cruz does a decent job. Saurabh Shukla is mesmerizing in a strong supporting role.

It's remarkably devoid of vanity.The film also dwells on childhood fantasies like creating a reflection of light on the wall with glass, sailing paper boat on the water during rainy season, playing with fireflies at night.

            "content": "This is a movie you CANNOT hate. A movie where the protagonists are handicapped comes with a risk of unnecessary melodrama. Barfi! steers clear of this path and Basu manages to entertain the audience with really engaging scenes.The story is more or less a look back on the life of Barfi (Ranbir Kapoor) by Shruti (Illeana D'Cruz) and a Sub-Inspector (Saurabh Shukla). Barfi's relationship with Shruti and Jhilmil (Priyanka Chopra) is looked into and it also has an crime investigation flavor to it (which makes it a wee bit more interesting). How Barfi goes through his life from 1972 to 1978 (Darjeeling - Kolkata) is pretty much the movie. It has twists which are quite subtle.Anurag Basu has been very true to the movie. He has put a lot of heart to each of the scenes. Sometimes he has been really over-indulgent which drags the movie, especially in the first half. The movie is at least 20 minutes too long. Some cruelty with the scissors would have made the movie crisper and more enjoyable.The biggest positive to me was the utterly stunning camera-work (S. Ravi Varman). The landscape shots and the clever use of focus was fabulous. Really loved the feel of the small town and the countryside. The background score was fantastic as well - never intrusive yet always adding to the situation. Must give credit to Pritam (assuming it is not lifted) Ranbir Kapoor has put in an excellent performance. There are some solo acts within the movie where he really proves his mettle. You cannot help but feel what he is trying to make the character in the movie feel. Priyanka Chopra is also very good in her role; you do pity her character. This is a seriously courageous performance from both. Very few leading actors would embarrass themselves for their characters. Respect!Ileana D'Cruz and Saurabh Shukla play regular people but do put up very competent performances. Illeana showcases a range of emotions in the movie very well, but it will surely be overshadowed by Ranbir and Priyanka purely because of the nature of their characters. The rest of the cast do their job quite well.All in all, it is a thoroughly enjoyable movie. It doesn't make much of a point, though I doubt if that was the intention anyway. I suggest you watch this movie when you are in a fairly relaxed and patient mood. Bollywood producing cinema of this quality is rare.EDIT: Since the review, I have learnt that fair number of scenes were copied and so was the background score. I have cut a point for that. That however should not make the movie any less watchable.",

Quite big, get bored at times, but nevertheless.... Very well acted by Priyanka and Illeana. After Kites which was not up to the mark, Anurag Basu hats off.. don't miss Barfi !Another smashing hit by Ranbir Kapoor.. Till now in 2012 he deserves to be the best actor for 2012. After a long time some one from Kapoor family has rock the bollywood. Barfi is a film you can watch and enjoy with family and friends. To sum it up, Barfi is an emotionally stirring yet joyous ride that will make you fall in love with love and life. A must watch for one and all!",

Ranbir Kapoor's talents are endless as this movie required the ability to communicate so much using his facial expressions and physical agility to capture the viewer throughout. The directing, writing and editing are at the highest level achievable. I have not seen an American film in the last 19 years that can even come close to this film. It goes to show that a story can be told without filling it with \"lack of confidence\" fillers such as violence and sex, but that the sheer talent of the director to tell a story can produce a work of art that would be hard to equal.This movie is the creation of an astute cast of actors, a clever and talented director and superb editors; it is exceptional in every way.",

I liked the movie but i felt little boring in few points, but overall its a good movie.The best thing in the movie is acting of Ranbir Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra ,they are really so awesome.There were some loose points in the movie too but they are fine as they are not on important scenes.Location for the movies in Dargaling and Kolkata were best in the movie. Ranbir Kapoor really impressed all by his great acting and his cool comedy.I loved many scene in the movie which were heart touching and many other romantic scenes.This movie deserve to be go for Oscars from India.I saw good drama,comedy and romance after Guzarish of Arithik Roshan and Ashwarya.

U have our best WishesNot only the way the story has been told is brilliant ,but the performances of each and every actor in this movie is above excellence. Ranbir has given a performance of such magnitude that is rarely seen in Bollywood now a days.Priyanka has again showed that she is a strong force to reckon with when it comes to performing challenging roles. But for me the actor who took the cake was Iileana D'Cruz. For a person who is doing her first Hindi movie and that too opposite two brilliant actors of this generation she just took the limelight from them whenever she was in a scene with them.",

The beauty of life is presented at every aspect of the movie. It strongly and deeply speaks that life is a festival... for each and every one.. no matter what is going on in his/her life.. difficulties are to come for sure... different difficulties in different forms for different people.. but all these (so called) troubles cannot stop one from enjoying life.. OR may be enjoying those troubles as well.. The hero of movie, Murphy (or Barfi) truly dances with life.. throughout his life..Love and marriage generally seen in the present society (which may be for good or bad??) is beautifully projected. And the best projection of a TRUE LOVE where only heart matters and mind in the long run only servers the heart to manage all other life needs. Thank you Anurag Basu..",

I was too drown in the original story of the movie, which is beautiful beyond all words, to notice or fuss about 'copied' scenes... I gave the movie a ten, only because there was no higher. It was a perfect combination of humour, romance and drama. It's the kind of movie that gets to you. It teaches us that some feelings need not be about perfection in others, it is their imperfections that we should embrace and cherish. If we keep looking for 'a perfect' other, if we give up what we have for what we might have, we may end alone; that's what happened to Shruti. As for Barfi and Jhilmil, you just cannot escape the 'beauty' of how it all came to be. Barfi went from the person who hits his head against the wall for being stuck with Jhilmil, to the one who would do anything to have her back. She was as disabled as he was, as imperfect as he was, yet it never stopped from sharing what she has with him; she taught him how to write his name, he taught her to spit melon seeds on the window and they had such much fun doing it. It was Jhilmil, not the beautiful Shruti, not his best friend, who was still standing there by his side when he gave his 'fidelity test'... It hit him that moment, as it hit us too: This is all that matters!People just need to learn how to enjoy things, and see the perfection that lies beyond the imperfections!",

            "content": "Barfi, Barfi, Barfi...There is so much I want to say about this film. I am not a native of India, but I love this film. This film is universal. At a time when we have shows like American Horror Story, Make It or Break It, and the Secret Life of American Teenager that feature characters with Down Syndrome or a physical disability, it's high time we have more films from all cultures that feature people from ALL walks of life in mainstream media. The timing couldn't be greater; more young people are being exposed to stories like this that reaffirms that we all may be different in some ways, but we seek love and acceptance all the same. I've always been a fan of Bollywood films...this one in particular made me laugh and cry and encourage me to further my studies in Sign Language. I personally want to educate myself in the multiple ways we can communicate with one another...and this film showcases how the spoken language is not the only form we can communicate love, desire, understanding, and compassion. It also does a good job of showing how we can preserver from all kinds of obstacles and still find life full of joy and adventure.The cinematography is breathtaking. It is beautifully styled and edited. And not enough could be said about the musical score that pairs so well with the art direction of the film. The actors who played their respective roles do so with a lot of heart that can be easily be seen and appreciated. When I did my research to see what others have said on the film, I was surprised by what the naysayers had to say. They nit-picked on the most obscure points...Yes, the director stated that this film is inspired by Keaton & Chaplin and other...how is that a negative?? So many films out there are inspired by others...and so many films are UNINSPIRED, poorly acted, edited, and so on...Whatever his inspirations were, this film is original to me...So lastly I want to say, do give this film a viewing. Like the rest of us, you'll surely be touched by this precious film. I enjoyed viewing it alone, but I think this film is best viewed with friends and family.",

            "content": "Barfi shows clear signs that Bollywood is diversifying and maturing as a film industry. It is nice to see new ideas explored, rather than dance routines and over-the top drama. The tired Bollywood formulae is becoming an absolute bore to watch, as I have seen it plenty of times. Barfi is a fresh breath of air. It is a charming and delighful piece of film-makingThe storyline takes us on the journey to the 1970s India. The costumes, background and fashion are in line with the 70s decade. The director has done a great job in direction and cinemagraphy. I like the peaceful settings. As suggested by the title, Barfi is the main character. He is a young man who cannot speak or hear. I found the character engaging. He is always in trouble with the law, as he is up to some mischief. The comedy elements between the police and Barfi features as few of the scenes throughout the film. There is a bit of the old slapstick comedy in those moments. Barfi is a cheerful person and likes to have a good laugh. There is always pressure and high expectation to live up to the name and reputation of a legendary actor (Rishi Kapoor). He is a well established actor in the industry. Acting is in genes of the Kapoor family, as Ranbir displays a wonderful performance. He has really got into the mindset of the character. I admire Ranbir modesty about his success and he deserves an award for an excellent performance as Barfi. Priyanka Chopra's character as Jhilmil is well sketched, as an autistic childhood friend of Barfi. Priyanka is a much improved actress since earlier films I have watched featuring the star. There is romance blossoming between the two. It is really sweet to admire. Bollywood newcomer IIeana plasy her part beautifully as Barfi's first love on sight.I think the characters steal the show. There is a sweet tale in the story. The films convey an important message about life. I thoroughly enjoyed Barfi. I cannot fault the film at all. I did not want the film to end at any point. It is absorbing, engaging and filled with joy. Bollywood needs to keep it up in delivering quality films like this.",

Perfect on Story, Emotion, Drama and Acting.Anurag Basu is at his best. A movie like this was a great risk after Anurag's last movie 'Kites'. But hey, it has actually paid off. This is the kind of movie people wants to see, a PERFECT STORY..! Anurag has written and directed this movie so brilliantly, you hardly find any flaws. The moment the movie starts, there is a smile on your face. That's a job done by a song which is funny, humorous and brilliant. Now that's creativity, that's the first impression that directors should give the audience. The whole movie is so well balanced with emotions, everything is well placed.Ranbir kapoor is back with an amazing performance after Rockstar. He is so convincing in his character. In his last movie all that he did was scream his lung out, in this he doesn't say a word an yet he says a lot. He has always had to face lots of problems.A Deaf and Dumb person from birth, his mother dies after his birth and his dad a driver dies later in the movie because of Kidney failure, the girl whom he loved gets married to a guy from her college. The funniest part is how he test his friendship, that's something I would like to try with my friends. You instantly get attached to the character, his sadness and happiness is your. I am not an emotional person, but yeah that's how I felt towards the character. There is so much to learn from him.Priyanka chopra playing the character who's is suffering from Autism. I had no idea that Priyanka can act so well, she is very good in what she does in this movie. You will forget the glamorous and sexy girl that she is. She is sent to a center where people like her is taken care of. She knows Barfi from her childhood, they share a beautiful relationship. It's a relationship that nobody can explain. Brilliant performance by her.Illeana is spectacular in her first bollywood movie. She has done very well in South Indian movies, now it's time for to shine in Bollywood. She is the girl that Barfi falls in love with. He approaches her is a very impressive way. She slowly falls for him, but it's too late by the time she realizes that. She gets married to the guy from her college. After 6years of her marriage she meets Barfi again, and with a new hope to get him back in her life.Music is by Pritam. His music is always great, I like his music very much. So had lots of expectations from him, and yeah he din't disappoint. He made song that improves the movie in every way possible. Every song in the movie is amazing, melodious, it tells so much about the movie and the characters. My personal favorite song is 'Aashiyaan'.On the whole, the movie is very brilliant, realistic and inspiring. It's a kind of movie i want to watch again and again. If you are in love this is the movie u want to watch with your partner.",

All the credit goes to Lead Actors Ranbir Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra and Director Anurag Basu for making this film a 100-crore blockbuster. This film will definitely make you laugh, cry, feel free and much more. Moreover, this is a type of movie which you can watch with family, friends and anyone. Since this is a romantic movie so couples can also enjoy watching it. Believe me, if you watch this movie only once, you will definitely watch it 3-4 times more and each time you will laugh and cry and believe that this movie is really the best movie. I have also watched it 10-11 times and I am not going to get bored of this. Barfi did also get official entry in the Oscar Awards 2013, so it is quite obvious that this movie can't get even 8/10 but much more than it. So go for it.",

I'm just out of my adjectives!!! Ranbir was absolutely brilliant too. Until Priyanka came to the scene, he was blowing it up. And then Priyanka made it Grand! And together, they created one of the Best movies on the earth. Ileana is beautiful and she performed nice too. As Priyanka and Ranbir will take away all the credits, she will not be mentioned that much. But she was also mesmerizing. Anurag Basu, the director, showd some guts to draw his dream picture and let it not go away to be a lush bollywoody flick. Kudos to him. More to mention, I was also amazed how beautifully Ranbir imitated Charlie Chaplin's trademark shots! In total, Barfi! is outrageously beautiful! A full 5.00 out of 5.00 for this piece of art!!",

The actors do a terrific job and carry this story without it drifting into a plain tearjerker or empty comedy. I am new to Bollywood cinema but I was familiar with Priyanka Chopra (Miss India and World 2000). Her performance really caught me by surprise.

            "content": "\"Barfi!,\" from directing to cinematography to editing, is well put together, especially for an Indian movie. I really enjoy how the film tends to focus on the positive as opposed to all the melodrama. Yes, it does get melodramatic, but not for too long. We get some beautiful shots of the scenery, but what would a technically sound film be without a script? This film has top notch writing with interesting characters and a sweet story that will melt the coldest of hearts. The story is pretty simple, but it is done in a unique way. There is minimal dialogue and most of it is conveyed through action, sort of like classic movies of the past. It's cute and adds to the overall charm of the film. However, the story is over complicated by some contrived plot points. One in particular happens towards the end of the film, but for the most part it doesn't take away much from the film. Another issue would be with how the story is told, at times it gets confusing because it jumps from brief moments of three different time periods. Even with some of these issues the film manages to come through with a sweet, touching, and charming story.\n\nActing is top tier for the most part. Ranbir Kapoor proves yet again that he is the new leading man in Indian cinema. His performance of Barfi is touching yet subtle. He has a sense of charm and charisma that bleeds onto the screen. No matter what the character is doing, you can't help, but love him. Priyanka Chopra gives a career transforming performance. She's usually known as the beauty queen, but here she shows a lot of depth and understanding for her autistic character. I couldn't believe that this is the same person. The rest of the cast is good, but the one to look out for is Ileana D'Cruz, who made her Bollywood debut. Her character is emotionally disturbed and indecisive. She's likable and we can root for her.\n\nThe score and songs for this film are great as well. The score has a upbeat style to it that at the same time feels whimsical. It brings you back to an era of your own youth. The songs are equally as good. They are fun and super catchy. They drive their respective scene along and it helps glide over some of the melodramatic moments.\n\nOverall \"Barfi!\" is a fun and entertaining flick with a lot of heart. The story is well told and fairly original. The cast of characters are colorful and their respective actors do justice to their complex roles. Music is a driving force for this film and aids in each scene.  While the movie can get confusing and the third act feels a bit contrived, the film's charm and sweetness more than makes up for it. I give it 4/5, There's enough entertainment and lovable moments to overlook any missteps.",

I, personally, love the way Ranbir says \"BARFI (murphy)\". The scene where Ranbir Kapoor explains to Illeana as to why she rejected him is just top class acting. Oh! His mute acting is just so brilliant, so amazing.\n\nIlleana D'Cruz, yes, you are really cute. But Priyanka, without any glamour, steals the show. Ranbir and Priyanka overpower everything. Priyanka proves yet again how versatile she is.\n\nThe music gives a good feeling within. Yes, the background score was a rip-off or intelligently used or whatever but it was apt.\n\nI don't understand the critics though. They say \"the director's not content with a simple story\", \"he complicates the narration with confusing timelines\", \"there's a needless-who-dunnit subplot\" What is your problem? It's really easy to talk when compared to stepping out there and directing a movie! So I personally think sometimes you guys should shut the...\n\nThe movie has a good mix of acting, comedy, drama, love, background score, songs, little twists and turns and above all excellent direction! Anurag Basu is the real hero. Thank you for such a nice and a different movie.

Although, sound doesn't look like genuine India's sound, but reminded to me music themes from latina's telenoveles and some Japanese movie, also that mysterious trio playing here and there reminded to me something from La Rue K\u00e9tanou. And of course there is still enough of overacting and a bit of nonsense not to get to the top but to stay at 8/10. And a time... 2 hours and 30 min it's a way too much!!!

And though this kind of love, between Jhilmil and Barfi, may be quite whimsical, it's the kind of love that really makes you believe in love.

This is an unlikely combination, which Doesn't seems like to work in Indian Cinema but things have been changed and great success of Barfi proves that even if the hero and heroine are not stereotypical a good story can lead to utmost success.  Barfi is not a perfect movie, it was too long and becomes complicated as we travel back and forth between 1976, 1979 and 2012. Besides that life being so easy and cheerful for a mute boy and autism girl is hard to accept, there is a time they live alone for 6 months in big Calcutta city, he can't talk and she doesn't understand but apparently they are happier than ever, how they communicate with world is not explained. Anyways I know it's a movie and i should not go onto that much dept. So, kudos to Anurag Basu for making and attempting a brave subject matter. Ranbir Kapoor is great as always, though his performance is almost the same as in a movie \"Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani\" with Katrina Kaif \"where he tries to get her affection\". This time he was only mute. Priyanka Chopra did a fine job and looked the part. Ileana D'Cruz is a fresh faced beautiful girl. Standing next to too famous young actors and still getting noticed is a huge achievement. In the end, Barfi maybe long but it's fresh, beautiful and heartening.",

So this is about a young man, who is both deaf and mute, on his search for love, only it may not turn out how you think.  While I am still looking for a Bollywood movie that I am head over heels for, this is definitely one of the better ones I have seen.  I watched this in two different parts, as there is an intermission, and I think that helped to improve my opinion of it; ultimately, it is a sweet story, and it's difficult not to be won over by it.  What I did like about it was the lead, as played by Ranbir Kapoor.  He brings a lot of charisma to the table without talking, and they pull off a lot of stunts that are akin to those of the silent era of film, and they really work.  It would have helped in a number of spots if I had any familiarity with sign language; you can get the gist of what is being communicated when they are utilizing it, but it is just like watching a foreign movie without subtitles.  Where Barfi constantly lost me is that it has these wacky, goofy scenes all played for laughs right next to these serious scenes about autism, and they don't really fit together.  It even reaches the point where the silly seeps into the serious, like our main character walking into a door after some stuff just went down, and it did get in the way of my enjoyment of the film.  It is also the type of movie where if you changed the music for any given scene, it would completely change the context of the entire story.  Still, it did finish off on a note that I genuinely loved, and I walked away feeling much more positive than negative.",
