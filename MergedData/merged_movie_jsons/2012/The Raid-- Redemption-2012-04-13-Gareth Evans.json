The fight scenes are probably from the best ones I have ever seen and the understated performances of the protagonists fit perfectly here. I m wondering how did I miss this 10 years ago...probably because it's Indonesian! Written and directed by a Welsh guy -who discovered the Indonesian lead Iko- together with a tight editing and insane fight scenes (mostly Indonesian and some mixed martial arts) makes this a must to watch for fans of the martial arts genre and not only. If you want to stay bolted at your seat while watching an action film -and you don't mind of course the violence- then check this out. From the top 10 contemporary martial arts flicks out there, 9/10.",

            "content": "The Raid, a new non-stop cornucopia action film, comes from the most unlikely of sources \u2013 Indonesia. But don't let the country of origin fool you. The Raid is jam packed with some of the best action sequences we've seen in years and audiences are sure to walk away with an adrenaline rush punch to the gut that far exceeds their forked (over) entertainment dollar.Starring a bunch of actors we can guarantee you have never heard of and written and directed by Gareth Evans (another name you are surely not to recognize), The Raid offers big time action sequences chalked full of gunfights, knife fights and enough hand-to-hand combat to rival any movie in recent memory.The idea behind The Raid is remedial. A group of well armed police officers enter a 15-story apartment complex overflowing with a group of better armed drug dealers and bad guys intent on holding their ground. The police are lead by an over anxious Lieutenant who leads his squad of mostly rookies into the apartment complex where they are quickly over matched and out gunned. Their objective is to find the drug lord who resides on the 15th floor and bring him to justice. Easier said than done.Bodies on both sides of battle fall to the ground like rounds from a Gatling gun in an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. The police \u2013 those that survived the opening shootout \u2013 are split into two groups with Jaka (Joe Taslim) fighting alongside the Lieutenant and a rookie officer, and Rama (Iko Uwais) who tries to protect an injured officer while battling the hordes of oncoming baddies.What ensues over the course of the next 80-minutes is a rip-roarin' blast of gratuitous bloodletting. The gun battles are more intense than the bank robbery scene in Michael Mann's Heat, the apartment hallway battles make the scene in Oldboy look like a Pixar film and the cops are as overmatched as U.S. Army Rangers were against an entire Somalian town Black Hawk Down.Director Gareth Evans clearly wants you to leave your brains at the door and celebrate in violent beatings and fight sequences that were stylishly choreographed and continue with such relentless regularity that you almost want to pause the projector to catch your breath before the next group of bare-fisted bruisers hit the screen. Our two main leads take more body blows than John McClane did in all four Die Hard films and their resilience and ability to be beaten to a pulp and yet have the ability and the strength to continue fighting is beyond this reviewer's comprehension.If there was but one small issue we had with the film it was that everyone who lived in the apartment complex had the fighting skills of an UFC righter or karate expert. Young, small, big or tall, they hall knew how to deliver a multiple high-kicks or at least take one and get right back up for more.There is a small twist in the film that is clearly evident a reel before the actual reveal on screen, but it hardly takes away from the fun filled excitement leading up to the plot turn.The sum of all its parts makes The Raid a must-see for anyone appreciative of non-stop battles where machetes are luxury and where a broken fluorescent tube can send a packed theatre into jubilant applause. It may lack the sophistication of The Departed, but it catered to an audience that couldn't get enough by the half-way mark and then was left gasping for air like a prized fighter in the 12th round towards its conclusion.www.killerreviews.com",

            "review_title": "Minimal plot, intense action",
            "content": "OK, let me start by praising Iko Uwais. Of all the actors, this guy fits the character flawlessly and is a highly likable actor. I thought I'd root for Joe Taslim (Jaka) better because of his better looks and taller figure but Iko is perfect.The movie in terms of story: interesting. The premise is very simple, a bunch of cops trapped in a hellish building filled with the devil's men who knows silat and dead set on killing the cops. However, I can't really tell whats going to happen next, and there's enough twists that actually works, even if they were rather clich\u00e9 (the rookie, the corrupt officers, the help from a friendly neighbor, the .. i should stop.. or i'd spoil the movie). There's nothing new in terms of plot, but that's not really a big problem. I sure do hope Gareth can find better writers to write the story next time.What I do like is the pacing. It goes boom boom boom boom! and then it rests a bit before going into suspense mode, scary mode, and then boom some more.Line delivery? Not very good. Some lines were obviously translated from English (it's written by Gareth himself) and some sounds quite cheesy (overused in other movies), like A: \"Why us? why now?\" B: \"Why not?\" Or \"I need to get in, my wife is sick\" And a bunch of others..Secondly, some of them are not professional actors and as an Indonesian watching an Indonesian movie without subtitles, I couldn't catch most of the things they said! I wished there were subtitles!! I wished there were Indonesian or English subtitles so that the foreigners in indo can enjoy the movie as well! (although there's one guy with a manado accent who talks funny, obviously a joke which will not be noticed by foreigners) They either talked really quickly, or had poor articulation/enunciation that I couldn't hear what they said and had to ask my sister, who also didn't catch what they said, and had to ask her boyfriend. The only one actor whom I can hear clearly even when talking fast is the gang boss (Ray Sahetapi).. A veteran actor, obviously trained for acting.By the end of the movie we also concluded that the Indonesian vocabulary in terms of curse words is so very limited. The word \"anjing!\" (means \"dog\") is used over and over, by everybody.. And the word \"bangsat\" (a bedbug) a few times.. \"Babi\" (pig) once, \"kampret\" (a small bat) once... They all basically means the same thing \"Bastard\"... So, this either means we are a really polite culture.. Or that they're trying to avoid censor.. Or that the translator for gareth's script has not enough vocabulary list... or maybe I really didn't get the badness of those animal curse words..I mean I can think of many English curse words that is not too dirty.. Like.. Scum, filth, bastard, jerk, son-of-a...., prick, damn, what the heck, slime.. OK I don't really know how to translate those words into spoken Indonesian either so...The fights were great. I can't comment on the choreography because I'm not a professional, but it puts you on the edge of your seat, so I think that speaks for itself. They hit hard, they fall hard, they kill hard, they die hard. I thought that some fights could be sped up a bit, as some moves looks like it lags a bit in terms of syncing, but only by a bit. If not, it adds a real touch to the physicality of the movie.Most of the girls shrieked and made wriggling sounds during fight sequences (yes, one really shrieked out loud), and many sighed a relief, almost awkward laugh, when those fight sequences end. Which, in my opinion, means that the fights were a great success.As an animator I felt the CG was a bit...hmmm... CG blood is slightly overused, but still acceptable, but one shot stuck out like a sore finger to me, the one where one guy falls over and lands on a balcony ledge. I really wanted to fix that animation.. Hahahaa... But again, that's because I'm a trained animator, as other people in the cinema gasped in their seats thinking that was real etc.All I know is, it lived up to my expectations (a minimal story fight movie). I look forward to Iko, Yayan, and Gareth's next collaboration, which is this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0hYVksfyrQ Again, if you're an action movie fans, you'd probably like it.",

Both films showcase the traditional Indonesian martial art Pencak Silat, with fight choreography by Uwais and Yayan Ruhian, who also worked on Merantau. After watching merantau, i was waiting anxiously for the raid redemption. Didn't had the hope that it might release in India. There was no endorsements or trailers on Indian channels. No marketing, but just a small ad in Bombay Times newspaper. I was rejoiced after i came 2 know that its releasing in theater. I had hope in Gareth n Uwais, but many ppl here was not aware of 'em. If you like martial arts movies, this one will blow you away! The choreography on the fight scenes is insane. This movie is a bone-shattering symphony of brutal fight sequences, awesome gun play and heart-thumping tension. The Raid's main lead played by the impressive Iko Uwais and the film's fiercest villain Yayan Ruhian are both incredibly skilled, life-long practitioners of the lesser known Indonesian martial art Pencak Silat. Awesome direction n writing by Gareth Evan. Really hats off to him for giving us (action movie junkies ) a masterpiece like this. Awesome editing by Gareth Evan. U don't feel bore even for a single minute. Best choreography by iko uwais n yayan ruhian. Nice cinematography by Matt flannery.",

            "content": "NOTE: Early, gushing reviews from TIFF Midnight Madness presentations should not generally be trusted, as many fest-goers are unable to separate the film from the experience, and formal critical consensus often sends most Midnight films into obscurity. Thankfully, THE RAID earns its stripes and deserves its praise, and stands firmly above the typically overeager reactions heaped on many other films screened in the Midnight program this year and in years past.- - - - - - - - - - - - - In the future, when someone tells you a movie is wall-to-wall martial arts and gunplay, you should have no choice but to ask them how it rates against this picture, which has so much gunfire and brutal martial arts action -- all of it meticulously choreographed in ways more refreshing than I'd ever have thought possible in this world of peak-performance Donnie Yens and Tony Jaas -- that I very nearly lost the hearing in my right ear, in no small part thanks to the tendency of TIFF sluggos to mistake volume for quality when adjusting their sound levels in an aged, less-than--acoustically-ideal theatre. Star Iko Uwais is the real deal: wiry, lightning-fast and evidently the leader of a team of experts that truly takes martial arts choreography into new territory with this film (and, to a lesser extent, MERENTAU before it). If there's a downside to his inevitable celebrity because of this film, it's that Indonesian cinema in general will fare no better than Thai cinema has in the wake of Tony Jaa. Like Jaa, anything Uwais makes from this film on -- especially if he keeps teaming with writer-director Gareth Evans, as he should for at least a couple more pictures -- will gain instant and welcome interest from the west, while the rest of Indonesian cinema (such as it is!) will remain the domain of low-brow entertainment that caters largely to the locals, with the exception of the occasional horror movie that can be scooped up for exploitation by \"Asian Extreme\" DVD labels and streams in the U.S. and Europe. What really separates this picture from the hordes of martial arts films from the region is its heavy use of Silat, the native martial art of Indonesia. I've seen a billion martial arts pictures over the years, and a million \"styles\" to go with them, but I'll admit my knowledge of Silat was absolute zero, and this movie turned out to be a wonderful wakeup call. The key thing about Silat is that it involves knives, lots of 'em, and the film's heroes and villains deploy them with extreme prejudice for almost the entire duration. One stab won't do, but ten capped off by a throat slashing is a good way to gauge whether you've won the battle. By way of example, picture the exemplary alley-fight-with-sharp-weapons between Donnie Yen and Jackie Wu Jing in SPL (a personal favourite sequence). Now, double the speed (!), and make the ultimate goal to stab, slice or otherwise eviscerate your opponent into oblivion, and you've got most of the hand-to-hand combat in THE RAID. Hero cop Uwais has this neat little trick where he stabs a long blade deep into your upper thigh, then yanks it clean down to your kneecap. Ouch! This thing is bloody with a capital B, but it's so exceptionally well choreographed, photographed and edited that you never lose sight of the geography surrounding the combatants or feel like you've missed a single blow or puncture as each new pair (or group!) of fighters grinds each other down. Evans' editing in particular is a standout, and rather refreshingly, it isn't used to hide little bits of phony business or make the fight participants look more skilled than they really are, such as it often is in so many action pictures these days (both in western, and, sadly, many Asian cinemas; Legend of the Fist, I'm looking at you). Evans' performers know their stuff, and his editing does more showing than telling. As to the picture as a whole, if you thought the final 40 minutes of John Woo's HARD BOILED were collectively one of the greatest pieces of action cinema from anywhere ever, imagine that cinematic Nirvana expanded to feature length, and with virtually no fat. The movie starts with a team of elite cops attempting to covertly secure a maze-like high-rise slum apartment building run by a merciless drug lord (when we first meet him, he's executing five bound and gagged men in his office, but he runs out of bullets for the fifth guy, which causes him to casually grab a hammer out of his desk drawer . . . ). Within minutes, though, his goons -- who populate every floor of the building like cockroaches, fight like rabid dogs and spontaneously appear around every corner and out of every doorway -- turn the tables and wipe out most of the fleet in a monster battle of guns, fists, feet and the ubiquitous knives, trapping just a precious few of our heroes on the sixth and seventh floors with little hope of escape. Aside from a couple of quiet moments where allegiances on both sides of the field shift, not unexpectedly, that's pretty much it in terms of plot, and it obvious the filmmakers would have it no other way. This is a showcase, for Silat, for Indonesia and for Iko Uwais, who is very much the \"next Tony Jaa\" (as I'm sure he'll be labeled far and wide), for better and, somewhat regrettably, for worse in terms of his country's film industry, for he may very well come to single-handedly represent it around the globe. Not that I'm complaining after having been winded by such an audacious effort as THE RAID.Barry Prima who?",

            "content": "Let's put this bluntly: THE RAID kicks ass. If you're a fan of martial arts movies where two skilled men beat the hell out of each other for an eternity, then this is the film for you. However, if you value dense and complex plotting, method actors working through depths of emotion with subtlety and skill and a sublime and intellectual subject matter, then you'd better bypass this one. THE RAID is all about action, action, and more action.The first thing that becomes apparent is this film's low budget. Ostensibly set in a tower block, in reality the whole of the film takes place in just a few corridors and rooms within that place. There isn't a huge cast, either, so the tagline '30 floors of chaos' is a bit of a cheat, as 27 or so of those floors are entirely superfluous (besides, when they show the tower block at the beginning it looks to be about 15 stories high rather than 30). Nevertheless, Welsh director Gareth Evans knows just the way to get the most of out his sets and budgets, utilising props, set dressing and imaginative segues from one scene to the next in order to convince you otherwise.The storyline is very slim indeed, and barely worth scribbling on the back of a beer mat. Character motivations are slim and even the hero barely gets a look in in terms of back story and drive. Tony Jaa's WARRIOR KING looks like a masterpiece of complicated storytelling and nuanced acting in comparison to this. But I haven't mentioned the action yet, and that's where the film really excels.The fight scenes are exhaustive, exhilarating and completely fascinating. Evans makes use of hyper-kinetic camera-work to weave in and around his opponents with just the right level of speed and sophistication to allow his audiences to feel every kick and punch. The actors are exceptionally skilled; Uwais has the chance to become an action superstar in his own right if he keeps up with what he achieves here, although the real star of the movie is Yayan Ruhian as the villainous henchman, Mad Dog. Ruhian is a beast, a tiny top fighter who seems virtually unbeatable as the film progresses. Lashings of violent death, some explosive shoot-outs and ingenious methods of destruction and one great CGI set-piece involving a stairwell later, plus an extended fight scene at the climax which just gets better and better.This is a draining experience, up there with the best that the martial arts genre has to offer. It's even better on repeat viewing, and it might, just might, serve as the launching point for at least three new careers in action cinema (Evans, Uwais and Ruhian). If, like me, you've seen so many action flicks that you're getting slightly bored with them, check this out and be left reeling by a real powerhouse punch to the gut.",

If your seeing this movie, it's because you want to see action and The Raid hit every mark. The action is a mix of shootouts, hand to hand weapons, and mostly good ol' fashioned fists.The Raid proves again how far behind American action films are. I've seen other great foreign action films like Ong-Bak, The Protector, and Ip man but The Raid surpasses them by highlighting a martial art style not shown in any recent films. Its brutal and never lets up. It's not your typical ultra clean fighting that has been done to death but something that looks real and desperate at times as people try to survive outnumbered.Story wise it isn't anything great but at the same time it's better than most martial arts films due to interesting twists and being incredibly well paced to before you know it its over and you want more.If your a fan of action films, there isn't any better out there now or any even close in decades past.",

So when I heard about the excitement caused by an Indonesian martial arts thriller called The Raid, I felt I needed to check it out.It's no secret that Hollywood action films have been stuck in a recent rut. They have relied on the same ageing bunch of actors making increasingly inferior films with tired scripts.The Raid owes a debt to Die Hard as the action takes place in a tower block. A SWAT team are out to capture a crime lord and two of his most trusted man, the brutal Mad Dog and Andi located on the 15th floor.The SWAT team includes a rookie, Rama (Iko Uwais) a devout Muslim with a young wife, heavily pregnant. The team is led by Sergeant Jaka and supervised by a shifty Lieutenant.However the team are soon trapped as the raid is discovered and the hordes of bad guys start to pick off the SWAT team members until there are only a few left. Its Rama with his fighting skills that helps the others to survive but it seems he is getting help from an unlikely source and the remaining SWAT team members without help need to break out from the block to escape.The version I watched is subtitled, the storyline is basic and functional. What is important is the unrelenting action and breathtaking choreography which is obviously inspired by Hong Kong martial arts cinema.The film was directed by a Welshman, Gareth Huw Evans who is certainly a talent worth following.

            "content": "I think other reviewers have explained the film quite detail so I only write about the experience I get over this film.The background story is about a SWAT team trying to bring a ruthless and untouchable crime lord to justice. However this film is only focusing on a specific event in that story : THE RAID part - that turns into a brutal, and bloody survival game. It's become a final match or showdown between good vs bad guys. And you should see it that way if you want to really enjoy it.We don't watch a final sport's match, any soccer, football, MMA fight etc looking for the plot, do we? We come because we want a great show, excellent executions and brutal take down, and any other things that could rush our adrenalin to the max. So forget about the plot!We enter the building along with the good guys. We scream, yell, jump etc every time they score, though some bad guys are so nasty that they also caught our attention. We are scared, worried, angry when their luck runs out. Our heart is pounding when we know exactly or we think they're entering a deadly situations. We hold our breath on some very tense moments (and this film has quite a lot of it), even feel their pain. In the end we go home feel that we're just attending a good. exciting and satisfying game - which we want to see it again and again if we can, and the good thing is, we certainly can.The combination of the cinematography, choreography, shot's angles, the original score (I'm curious how Mike Shinoda will outperform an already good score), effects and the editing are so perfect as if you're there. And if you think the trailer is cool, it's just a tip on the ocean's surface from an enormous iceberg below. The film itself is super-super cool!100 mins flies so fast and when the credit rolls, I still sit there, thinking if I could catch the next show - which sadly impossible because the ticket has sold out in minutes, several days before.Of course, The Raid is not without flaws. The acting, the dialogs, the CGI, the twist - you know - those usual unconvincing stuff which you can find even in some blockbuster martial arts/action movies, can be improved. But overall it is a superb action movie so I understand the high-praised comments from those film festivals.Now, you may wonder why I compare it to Star Wars. Back then, when I first saw Star Wars, I was very amazed not by the story, plots or the acting, but by the cinematography, special effects, the laser saber duel, the sound effects, the robots, all those hi-tech stuff which are so an eye opener that we have no choice to compare the next sci-fi movies with it.The Raid does the same thing for action genre. And I will be waiting eagerly for the sequels or even the prequels just like Star Wars.This film is best seen with your group of friends who enjoy hardcore and bloody fights, so you can cheer, scream, yell, sigh together and talk about it (and probably count how many ways to die/kill people in this film) on the way home. Go to toilet before the shows so you don't miss any scenes. Snacks and drinks could be considered as 'nice to have' items. I was seating on the edge of my seat and my eyes were glued to the screen almost all the time that I only sip my drink once in the first 10 minutes and haven't touch my snack until the credit rolls.9.5 out of 10!

            "review_title": "\"The Raid: Redemption\" - 30 Stories of Sheer, Bloody Adventure!",
            "content": "In writer-director Gareth Evans's 2011 Indonesian action flick \"The Raid: Redemption,\" only about 10 minutes of the entire picture is spent developing the film's plot before it's all-out, literally non-stop wall-to-wall action sequences. There's a little something early in the beginning about a Jakarta SWAT team being sent to a 30-story apartment building to fish out a sadistic drug lord named Tama Riyadi (Ray Sahetapy), who rules this crime-ridden tenement with an iron fist.As could be expected, although things start out well as the team slowly but assuredly takes over the building floor by floor, all hell breaks loose once they reach the sixth floor - it must be their (un)lucky number.\"The Raid: Redemption\" is an astonishing martial arts-action thriller with plenty of sequences of hard-hitting, bone-crunching, bone-breaking action to keep your mouth watery; like most martial arts movies coming out of Southeast Asia these days, the actors look and sound like they're really going at it in full-contact, and it really looks and sounds like they're really getting hurt, too. Using elaborate martial arts choreography featuring the Indonesian fighting art Silat (plus borrowing a page or two from the Tony Jaa school of hard-knock fighting) and combining some of the most valuable elements from American action movies such as \"Die Hard\" (1988), \"Assault on Precinct 13\" (1976), \"The Rock\" (1996) and \"The Warriors\" (1979) plus Takashi Miike's samurai bloodbath \"13 Assassins\" (2010), \"The Raid: Redemption\" tells an exotic, self-contained story of fighting men fighting for survival.It's another pristine example of Asian action cinema done right that may have something in it for those primarily accustomed to Hollywood action flicks (if they look hard enough). While the movie does contain your usual intensely bloody shootouts and foot-chases down darkened apartment building corridors, the main focus is on the unarmed, closed-quarters combat fighting sequences, which there are way more of than gratuitous gun battles and are shot with such energized, bloody gusto that you honestly can't help but feel every single blow delivered - whether it be a good guy or a bad guy. Yes, once they lose their weapons, they have to punch, kick, and claw their way out of the 30th circle of Hell. After almost all the SWAT team members are nearly wiped out by Tama's thugs, it's up to a young SWAT officer named Rama (Iko Uwais, from Evans's earlier cult film \"Merantau,\" which I haven't seen) to get his remaining teammates out alive and to safety.Pretty much in all of Rama's many, many hand-to-hand combat confrontations with both armed and unarmed thugs, anything and everything goes. Additionally, anything and everything available (and within reach) becomes a weapon - hammers, garrotes, machetes, axes, propane tanks, police batons, knives, broken fluorescent tubing, and the occasional splintered door. It's all really stunning stuff to witness on the screen, and Iko Uwais - also the film's co-fight choreographer - is more than capable of holding his own against a legion of bloodthirsty criminals, while also taking punishment of his own from all sides from his attackers. That's really the key to any action hero, in my opinion - to have a hero who can indeed kick a lot of a**, but also be able to take a few licks of his own and keep on ticking. It also helps that Rama has a pregnant wife back at home, so it makes him a bit more human and vulnerable and gives him an extra incentive to want to survive - and it also gives us an extra incentive to want to see him live through this ordeal.It's all amazingly bloody stuff to witness when you see the horrible things that humans are capable of doing to one another with just their bare hands. There are also several quieter, suspense-filled scenes as well, the most nerve-wracking of which being a scene where Rama and a severely wounded colleague hide behind a fake wall while an assailant repeatedly thrusts his machete through it, the blade barely missing Rama and his comrade. And also there's a wonderful electronic score on the American version of the film by Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda and Joe Trapanese to further fuel the adrenalin-laced plot and action sequences.\"The Raid: Redemption\" is a richly served-up action flick from one of the last places to appear on the world action movie market - Indonesia (even though Gareth Evans is Welsh). Throw out everything you thought you knew about well-made action movies (from anywhere, really), and witness first-hand \"The Raid: Redemption.\"10/10",

            "content": "My number one list action movie is The Matrix because it balanced the depth of the story with the action. Somewhere among the top list, there was also The Dark Knight for the same reason. However, when speaking only 'action', I used to choose a Hongkong movie, Flashpoint, starred by Donnie Yen. Before Flashpoint, I'll choose a Thailand movie, Ong Bak which launched Tony Jaa career internationally. Now, when I speak an action movie that speak for the action, I will choose an Indonesia movie, 'THE RAID', choreographed by Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhiyan and starred by them.The problem with Donnie Yen's Flashpoint was you need to wait about one hour and fifteen minutes to get the action really start but when it started, it was really worth to wait. The fight between Donnie Yen and Collin Chou, inspired by MMA especially BJJ was so well choreographed and made audience hold their breath and asking \"are this sh*t a real thing?\". In Evans' latest, THE RAID, you won't need those one hour and fifteen minutes because he already made the audience gasps in the first fifteen minutes.I wouldn't say a thing about Ong Bak because in my opinion, Merantau was more superior than Ong Bak. The problem with Merantau was Gareth was trying to bring audience to understand the culture of Silat first because showing the full action.You can said, Merantau was like Yamakasi doing for parkour while The Raid was the B-13 of silat.It is useless to review this movie from the plot because there wasn't any significant plot. The plot was made only to bridge between one action scene to other action scene. But d*mn! Even with the weak dialog and clich\u00e9 plot, Gareth executed it well so we, the audience, didn't have time to analyze this or that. What we know, we were flooded by f*cking awesome action movies from infiltration scene, massacre scene, and of course, martial art scenes when the characters have run out of bullets.I remember when one of Merantau review said Merantau was Ong Bak when handled professionally. The same can be said with THE RAID. The Raid was Flashpoint with larger actions and handled professionally from the music, cinematography, and even the visual effect.The music composed by Aria Prayogi and Fajar Yuskemal was like a combination between Hans Zimmer's Joker theme and Rage Against The Machine. It brought the audience immediately to the brutal tone of the movie. In some scenes, those music suddenly disappeared, leaving uneasiness to the audience. I wonder how Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park will interpret the scene to his score because Prayogi and Yuskemal score was perfect for the tone of this movie and it was really different with any Linkin Park score.The sound effect, oh my, I hardly believe this is Indonesian movie. Even Hongkong movies are rarely have this good sound effect, You can differentiate between the bullet shot next to you to the bullet shot from the next room, The sound of knife slashing was so beautiful to listen and combined by the beautiful art of Silat, the scene was a masterpiece of a brutal dance of angel of death.THE RAID has little visual effect but when they did, it was done amazingly and effectively. Frankly, prior to watch this movie, I was a little bit disappointed when I heard there will be slow-motion scene in the movie. However, Gareth proved me wrong. He was not Zack Snyder. The slow-motion was done only in one scene and perfectly executed which I hardly imagined how it should be done in other way.Matt Flanery and Dimas Subhono as DOP played camera creatively and yet it captured all the motion perfectly. In fact, some scenes was like a scene taken from art movie due to their creative angle but it didn't reduce the brutal tone of the movie, didn't make the impact of every punch and kick weaker, in fact, in some scenes, it enhanced the \"BAM!\" factor.The choreography was the factor which made this movie popular. I have said previously that even the fight scene between Donnie Yen and Collin Chou in Flashpoint had been surpassed by almost every fight scene in the movie. In Merantau, Gareth didn't want to show the brutal image of silat due to the main character of that movie was a naive and kind young man from village. In this movie, the characters are cops and bad guy, so either be killed or kill. Both Iko and Yayan have choreographed it so well so even one reviewer said \"I didn't know there was so many ways to kill people until I saw this movie\" and he was right. Jeff Imada (Bourne Identity) and Yuen Woo Ping will recognize these people from Indonesia and you'll probably hear about them in coming years among the top list of fight choreographer.After watching this movie, I found myself lost my appetite to other action movies. For me, other action movies was a snack before I can watch the next Gareth Evans project, BERANDAL.Kunderemp -",

            "content": "Increasingly now, foreign filmmakers are making better Hollywood action movies than Hollywood is. In this case an English director who evidently now works in Indonesia seems to have mastered all the action story tenets despite this being only his 3rd feature film. Even more, the number of layers to this story parallels the number of floors in the apartment building that is at the centre of this film. All I could think of is how Hollywood will eventually commandeer this film and make a lifeless by-the-numbers knock-off that will only stain the original. And of course, the budget of the original is about the same as a Hollywood B-list movie actor's salary.This film is a disciple of the Asian extreme action genre, with over-the-top karate and acrobatics mixed with guns and violence. Betrayal isn't just a plot twist in these films, it's the first act. At least 5 or 6 betrayals are expected in these type of films where thieves betray other thieves, cops betray other cops, and honest guys get betrayed by best friends. What makes this film a standout is the unflinching action and well choreographed fight sequences by leads Yayan Ruhian and Iko Uwais. Early Jackie Chan movies got this kind of notice overseas because of their energy and gifted action instincts. Here, Gareth Evans is a one man powerhouse writer, director, and editor, masterminding this intricate chess match of good guys trapped on the sixth floor, with angry thugs coming up from the fifth floor and determined killers descending from the seventh floor. You feel our heroes feel trapped and vulnerable. Evans finds sources of tension from many places. The apartment building has tenants with unknown loyalties. The man heading the raid has unknown motives. Each character is well established with a minimum amount of screen time, keeping the action going.I was urged by a movie reviewer to see this film, describing it as one of the best action movies ever made. And you have to agree, this film, after providing a few minutes of backstory, takes off straight into the police raid of the apartment building filled with bad guys and a gang lord. Cinematography takes lessons from \"Saving Private Ryan\", using hand-held documentary style footage during firefights, and blasting the soundtrack with dozens of loud guns firing at once. The pulsing synthesiser score also hits with the punchy music stabs that propel the momentum as the police troops make their way up to the big bad guy on the top floor.Action sequences are creative and provide new angles and fight tactics that keep the hand-to-hand combat kinetic. Fans of the Bourne movies are encouraged to seek this out. (Not a coincidence that a Bourne Legacy trailer played before this showing). Many human moments also ground this film. An innocent man caught in the crossfire, gets asked to risk his life. A police squad leader who gets frustrated when the man conducting the raid puts his troops at risk. A child hired as lookout for the gang lord must die in order to prevent him from sounding the alarm.There is an intensity to this film that resembles scenes from \"Black Hawk Down\", with very intelligent setups for conflict, and innovative approaches to getting from point A to point B. This fresh drive, propelled by good guy Iko Uwais makes this 1 hour 40 minute film zip along with no time out to catch your breath. The fact this film is subtitled will prevent it from being a widespread hit, although it will no doubt have a long life on DVD. Instead, I expect director Gareth Evans to be directing movies with 150 times the budget of this small gem within a very short time.",

            "content": "Released amongst a flurry of post-Expendables 80's action homages, The Raid arrived to be met with almost universal acclaim from audiences and critics alike. So while Stallone and his crew have wetted audiences appetites for big guns and corny dialogue again - that coincidentally coincided with the return of the original oiled-up arse-groper, Arnold Schwarzenegger - The Raid took action back to the hand-to-hand delights of Asian action cinema and created what is undoubtedly the finest collection of fisticuffs that has ever been committed to film. Made with little budget, an inexperienced cast, and a director from Wales (the movie itself is Indonesian), the result is simply mystifying, blowing away all pretenders.The plot is simple. Expectant father Rama (Iko Uwais) and a 20-man police squad led by Sergeant Jaka (Joe Taslim) and Lieutenant Wahyu (Pierre Gruno) are sent to an apartment block run by crime lord Tama (Ray Sahetapy). Made up mainly by rookies, the team intend to sneak in undetected, taking Tama and his two henchmen Andi (Donny Alamsyah) and Mad Dog (Yayan Ruhian) alive. Things don't go to plan when they are seen by a spotter and are quickly confronted by a small army of the apartment block's residents. With the squad separated and quickly getting smaller, and Lieutenant Wahyu's intentions becoming increasingly unclear, Tama announces that any man that kills a policeman will be allowed to live there free of charge, causing even more cronies to descend on them.While the plot sounds distinctly similar to that of Die Hard (1988) (and one copied by Dredd a year later), the set-up is a simple platform to allow director Gareth Evans to unleash a near-endless orgy of fists, feet, knives and, well, more fists. Had the action been anything less than spectacular, The Raid would be a massive bore, but thankfully, it is jaw-dropping. Every fight is a lightning-fast array punches and kicks with spatters of black humour and squirm-inducing deaths. Yet there are no bone-snapping close-ups or time-altering impact accentuations that plague action movies with lesser scope and respect for it's audience - this is fast, brutal, almost real. Sure, the characters simply defy the limits of the human pain threshold, but it's the realism of the punches and stabbings that give the fights their impact.You will need to leave your brain at the door however, as beyond the action scenes, there is very little going on in terms of story and believability, which makes the film somewhat shallow in terms of what it could have been given a little more thought. Every resident in the apartment complex is a master of some martial art or other. But that I can easily forgive, as it just offers the chance to make every single fight memorable. If you loved the famous fight scene in They Live, then you're in for a treat towards the end, where we get a truly nasty extended three-way face-off, that displays some fine martial artistry that will surely put pencak silat on the movie map. The Raid is destined to be the film that all action movies are compared with, and undoubtedly silenced by. Sadly, with the absence of any real plot developments, The Raid will always be a great action movie to me, rather than a great movie.",

            "content": "High Rating and Awards? People may be tricked for the first time because this movie comes from a very unusual country, Indonesia. It's not often we see action movie comes from this country. Furthermore, the casts also aren't well-known at all in the world but guess what, they're really giving a great show in this movie. Gareth Evans, a Welsh born writer/director/editor repeat his success creating action movie after several years ago releasing another action movie also made in Indonesia.For me, the real superstar in this movie is Rama (Iko Uwais), who was introduced as a newbie special force in the team. Fantastic martial art movements, which is traditional martial art called Pencak Silat from Indonesia truly filled this movie with wowing watcher's experience. Fast moves, intense close combat and his knife play in combat successfully increased my adrenalin. The best part of Iko was when He's about to face several people alone in a hallway. That was obviously cool. I think Iko plays the part like Jason Statham (fighting) and Steven Seagal (with his knife) but only better. The Raid was rained with bloodbath. So it's wise to avoid bringing children to watch this movie. The other character that stole my attention was this man called Mad Dog (Yayan Ruhian). In my opinion, it'll be difficult to find this kind of man in this world. His expression and fighting style was stunning.When I watch movies, I always intensely wait for the twists. The Raid doesn't give so many twists but it still has enough twist that improve the story. Still this is a nicely written story. Simple idea but creatively developed.At first, I thought it'll be a one man show where Rama played the whole part of fighting till the end. But I was wrong. The Raid gives fair proportion to fighters in this movie. Rama isn't the only one that showed a great fight against the enemy in this movie. There're the sarge, Andi, the last cop in control room. The only thing that disturbed me a little bit is the original dialog which is Indonesian. I don't know but it's kinda awkward for me to hear the conversation in Indonesian although it's my native language. As I imagine, it may sounds better in English. Never mind, it's just me.With only 1.1 million spent on this action movie, surprisingly give me such a great experience in cinema. Great movie. Great job!9/10",

This time it's Iko Uwais with a Indonesian martial arts pencak silat which is indeed a entertaining martial arts style to watch. It has other martial arts style in the movie but the main focus is silat. This movie is so cool that I am sure the makers for the movie \"Dredd\" got a lot of ideas from this flick. This movie is almost a non-stop martial arts action with some shootouts. And the execution of it all is just superb. Like what it says on the DVD cover it's 30 floors of fighting chaos. I just about enjoyed every minute of this movie and looking forward to more works from Gareth Evans who directed this movie. And is a avid fan of martial arts movies. Gareth Evans is one of those directors that claim they only make movies they want to see on screen. And don't put much thought on what other mainstream audiences are into. I for one enjoyed just about every aspect of this movie. Although this flick doesn't have a big budget going for it, they really did a great job with what they had.

If your goal is to walk into this movie and be psychologically challenged or expect great dialogue you will be disappointed. There are some movies that you need to walk into and know little of what will unfold to get the full cinematic experience. I always check the ratings of movies on IMDb before considering watching them and after reading some of the other user reviews on 'high octane' intensity and non stop fight scenes i in the least expected some good action in this movie. Even with that though i thought an entire movie could not be based on fighting scenes and score above an 8 on IMDb (boy was i wrong).This movie is earning glowing reviews because of the action sequences filmed in the movie that place you in a cinematic experience where you actually feel like you are watching real men fight for their lives. It's nothing poetic with backflips and flexible positions but simply man vs man often equipping anything in the room to disarm/disable and kill their opponent. It places you in the hot seat viewing the closest things to actual killings - Now this isn't to say the movie slows down on blood spurts or zooms in when someone is getting their throat sliced - it simply shows it how it is, it's fast, real and intense.In some of the other reviews you hear fans praising the knife fighting scenes. This movie was incredible with it's knife fights and how effective and swift they are in close quarters. The finish was always swiftly at the throat but that wasn't before 2 to 3 lightning touches to the chest/quads or arms to disable an opponent or render them shocked in pain.Heres the bottom line: This movie was made on the smallest budget i've ever seen for any movie to hit international screens. The director and all actors are no names that you have never heard however i guarantee that you will never watch another action film again because the raid is groundbreaking in it's reality/intensity and quality of choreography.Every movie that scores high ratings appeals to a certain group of audiences. This is a very specific movie but is well deserving of the praise it is receiving from our users at IMDb. It is my hope to see more of this action from the director and actors cause i honestly don't think i can ever watch a fighting movie again. MUST WATCH 10/10 Excellent.",

It feels like a violent ballet because the stuntmen are real life fighters and the fight scenes are choreographed very realistically. Even after 5 times watching it I am still amazed by the beauty of the fighting scenes and shocked by the cruelties committed.\"The Raid\" is unlike any other action movie I have ever witnessed in decades. This must be watched only by adults. Really NOT suited for the faint hearted, becasue the violence is so real and gruesome. \"The Raid\" is 90 minutes of a rollercoaster ride filled with blood and death. But despite all the violence there is still a good story to be found amongst the piles of dead bodies. It is not just a brainless fight movie. It really has got a heart in its story. And the acting is very convincing and real life like too. I will never forget those faces full of fear and hate of these actors. Brilliantly casted and performed. After 5 times rewatching this movie over the years, some fighting scenes stretched a bit too long for my taste: how much contineous violence can one absorb without getting numb? But that's my only small criticism. Would have rated it a 10 otherwise. Now I think this is the almost perfect action movie. 9 stars.

Recently, with the hype out-of-the-way, I decided to give it another shot with a clear head. I'm glad I did! This is an insane action movies that has almost everything an action fan could want. What I liked about it is the pacing. The first half is paced perfectly. It builds up the story very well, giving you a chance to get to know the main characters. Character development was pretty decent in this one, which I appreciated. Let's not fool ourselves, though! The main selling point is the action, and chances are, that's what you've come to see. The effects are relatively cheap, but a big budget wasn't needed. The tenement makes a wonderful setting, and even adds to the atmosphere. It feels rightly tattered. You won't be disappointed by the fight scenes! There are many fights that stand out, but the 2 on 1 fight between Iko Uwais & Joe Tasim against a ridiculously skilled (Ruhian) is the highlight. Those that like slow motion shootouts ( I don't) should enjoy as well. I predicted the twists, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the ride. Iko Uwais is definitely one of the most exciting new action stars. He reminds me of Tony Jaa, albeit less flashy. He's so fast, the camera couldn't keep up with him at times. This guy is certainly someone people should keep an eye on! Joe Tasim had instant chemistry with Uwais, and their conflict was not only endearing, but believable. Yayan Ruhian is a monster that you have to see to believe. He scared the crap out of me! Hopefully Hollywood notices the talent this guy has. The violence is pretty extreme, though not as violent as the sequel, which I have yet to see. This is an awesome action movie! Nothing more, nothing less.

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: The Raid",
            "content": "Written, directed and edited by Welshman Gareth Huw Evans, who together with leading man Iko Uwais and most of the core group who had worked together in their first feature film collaboration Merantau, The Raid picked up from the good groundwork established from that film, and translated big time into this, with bigger stunts and bigger action choreography. The action, oh the action, for the first time in an extremely long while, left me holding my breath, literally, before gasping for air when the dust settled. Never before had an action movie grab me by the scruff of my neck in attention like The Raid has, with eyes kept wide open for the fear of having to blink means losing out a single frame of a finishing blow. Merantau, if compared to this, was a tease of what the entire team can do, and under the martial arts choreography by Iko and Yayan Ruhian, who plays Mad Dog in the movie, the battle - tooth and nail, fight for survival type - sequences are a sight to behold.Evans handled The Raid with a deftness, building up suspense, anticipation and excitement like an old hand, despite this being only his third narrative feature film production. The level of complexity got increased here even if the scale of the film got reduced into from the sprawling city in Merantau, into a claustrophobic apartment block. There's CG enhanced firing of rifle rounds, before gun battles between opponents cook up a flurry of emptying magazines after magazines of automatic weapon rounds. When ranged weapons are no longer an option, in comes close quartered combat weapons like knives and batons against machetes and pipes, before the lowest common denominator of relying on bare knuckles, kicks, throws and the occasional head butt.To describe the action in the film would be a disservice in revealing too much, when it is best that you experience it for yourself. It's bloody, it's violent and it's no holds barred, bringing out panic, tension, and a great adrenaline rush as if putting you into the thick of the action like an embedded war journalist having to weave through attacks from all directions. In each carefully choreographed action milestone in the film, you're bound to discover many amazingly delivered fight sequence that you'll probably never seen before, keeping things really fresh even for the jaded action / martial arts film junkie, where you're bound to find a certain moment within each sequence that will serve as a talking point when the end credits roll, and providing you with rationale to just about watch the movie immediately again.Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhian just about found the perfect holistic ingredients that go about making hard hitting action films, with a competent stunt team and martial arts crew to deliver action just as the two of them conjured, making everything feel real when the going gets rough, with an eye for detail and attention, keeping fights credible with an element of real danger put into them. You'll be catching yourself more than once wondering, how the heck did these guys do that? But they did, and it's all up on film for everyone to witness. It's testament of their talent and their brand of martial arts being worked for cinema, and with this they had shown that they've come a long way from Merantau some 3 years back, despite being their second action film with Gareth Evans.Action films from South East Asia are raking up a storm, with Thailand leading the charge, Malaysia following suit recently, but Indonesia really cranking and setting the bar really high for everyone else to follow. The cinematography here is silky smooth, with none of the bullshit that Hollywood tries to force as a standard - what with its shaky cam and up too close camera angles - THIS is something that Hollywood should wake up to, where the camera flows and moves around the action, keeping things steady to capture the absolute beauty of martial arts being executed by professional practitioners, and allowing the audience to see who's hitting what/who, with edits and cutaways being kept to a minimum and logically done, rather than to cover up the lack of real skills by the stunt team, or try to pass off the non-trained actor as a modern day superman.Chances are I will want to watch it again in Singapore when it premieres next month, with slight differences of course. The soundtrack for the local release will follow the US', meaning we'll get to listen to Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park and Joseph Trapanese's version compared to the Indonesian one, which in itself is already rocking and suited the look, feel and mood that The Raid will bring to action cinema. For those, like me, who can't wait, you can either do the same crossing overseas, or pick up the Merantau DVD available if you have not seen that film yet. It will introduce you to a different aspect of Silat, one primed for action cinema, and provide you a sneak peek into what to expect from The Raid from just about almost the same main cast and crew who had progressed leaps and bounds from there.The best action movie of the decade some say, and I'll verify and concur to that with a resounding Yes. Definitely highly recommended, where action junkies will find a new film to pay homage to, as it powers its way to my shortlist of one of the best this year has to offer.",

If nothing else, director Gareth Evans uses \"The Raid: Redemption\" to bring pencak silat to audiences all over the world in this manner, but he also manages to create an action movie that satisfyingly merges B-movie violence with a true physical art form.The story of \"The Raid\" is neatly packed and delivered in a way that puts the emphasis on the characters and the action. A SWAT team is ordered to take out a crime/drug lord (Ray Sahetapy) in his 15-plus story building filled with dangerous and skilled men who are fiercely loyal to him. When they become trapped on the seventh floor, it becomes a fight for survival. One rookie cop in particular (Iko Uwais) must try to escape to return home to his wife and unborn child.Some twists reveal themselves along the way, but because of the contained nature of this story, they're pleasant surprises rather than forced and obvious. Boiled down, \"The Raid\" is a glorified arcade game premise. The finished product turns out to be bloody mayhem on screen.Evans somehow manages to strike a balance between fearful realism and over-the-top video- game violence. Larger action sequences take the shape of the latter, but the film takes numerous occasions to slow down and work the suspense so that the bigger, ultra- choreographed action feels like a culmination or climax. A scene where our hero, Rama, hides with his injured comrade in an apartment wall is of particular note on the more suspenseful side of things. The script recognizes that too much of one kind of action will kill the effectiveness of the entire product.The fight scenes are more creative toward the front of the film and sort of unravel into pure pencak silat choreography toward the end, namely because all the weapons have run out of ammo and all the knives buried into peoples' chests, necks, knees, etc. Perpetuating the video game analogy, much of the fights feel like stages/missions as well as mini-bosses, etc. If you enjoy that structure in gaming, \"The Raid\" will hit that same spot in a satisfying way.But what really makes \"The Raid\" work, or at least go beyond a lifeless and gory demonstration of Indonesian martial arts, is how the script works in subplots. Some characters are given moral ambiguity, some pure motivation ... basically, effort was taken with the writing to up the stakes of the mayhem. It might not be great writing or even that original, but it will motivate most people to root for Rama and against a myriad of thugs and other characters.It might be tough for Evans to replicate the success of the film with future outings now that pencak silat has more exposure and will consequently feel less novel, but \"The Raid\" offers a pleasant martial arts throwback mixed with a more contemporary violent action style that will work for anyone who identifies as an old-school action purist.~Steven CThanks for reading!

            "content": "In Jakarta, Indonesia, Lieutenant Wahyu (Pierre Gruno) organizes the invasion of an apartment building that is the safe house of the powerful and cruel drug lord Tama (Ray Sahetapy) and his gang. The SWAT team breaks in the building but one lookout sees and warns the gangsters and the police force is trapped on the seventh floor. They learn that Lt. Wahyu has not informed his superiors about the operation. Now the police officers have to fight with limited ammunition against the armed and dangerous gangsters. \"Serbuan Maut\" is a violent and full of action movie unfortunately without story. Actually it seems to be a video game, with police officers and gangster using different weapons and fight. I found it overrated in IMDb. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): \"Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Invas\u00e3o\" (\"Operation Invasion\")",

            "content": "One of the things I've always loved about the action genre is that like with the suspense thriller genre it's sometimes about the what ifs. Whether it being framed and forced to run, some evil organization trying to kill you, or surrounded by enemies, the joy of the action genre is on the possibility of overcoming and surviving the worst case scenario.The plot is great because it's simple and it feels plausible, whose to say no crime lord or organization ever had this ambush operation in the back of their mind. And once again it utilizes the few or one against the world scenario, I always love those types of battles because it's just always fun to think you can beat incalculable odds and survive.There real isn't much in characterization or characters, their all pretty much the typical archetypes. This film were purely in it for the action and theirs nothing wrong with that. I love the fact this film is action action it doesn't bother with any stupid boring melodrama or even complexity and twists that come out of the blue; it's simply no nonsense and straight to the point, which is what most of my favorite films are.The production value is great, it was done on a low or modest budget but it was used well and right. I really like the use of the building location, the fact it was dingy, dirty, gritty, and dark really helped give the film the element of suspense. The pacing is great almost like a video game, there is just constant action and suspense that you almost can't afford to take a breath. I really love the music score by Mike Shinoda, some parts of it were just exiting and really got your adrenaline pumping, but in the suspenseful sequences it was really suspenseful it almost felt a little reminiscent of the music I would hear in a John Carpenter film which is awesome since he's my favorite movie director.The suspense is great I really like how you do feel a sense of isolation and dread at times where the next turn in the hallway, corner, or floor could have a group of scumbags walking down ready to kill. Or even any of the doors a scumbag could pop out for a surprise attack. Let alone the fact this is all taking place in the interiors of an apartment building so there really aren't many places or space to really run or hide.But of course the best thing about the film is the action. There are a lot of memorable action sequences all superb choreographed and executed. Iko Uwais as Rama I think is a talented martial artist, I really love it when he executes some Mui Tai punching elbow combos he has some of the fastest hands and arms I've seen. I even like the gore effects in some places their practical and there are plenty of creative kills, my favorite is when Rama smashes the head of one scumbag on a wall about six times. And of course the battles themselves like one which is in some hallway and there are scumbags just popping out left and right charging toward Rama he just makes really quick work out of them with his knife and baton, just seeing him use the weapons and the techniques and combos he executes is awesome. But of course my favorite is the the two on one battle which is one of my favorite fights ever.The Raid has plenty of room for excitement.Rating: 4 stars",

That's it, nothing else.All the story is, is that there is a bunch of cops, and every level they go up in the block, gets a little bit more difficult and they become fewer, with a little bit of corruption thrown in for good measure.The film starts off very tensely, and as soon as Tama calls Lock Down, the film never lets up until the final frame.If you take Die Hard, and add a little Game of Death, you have The Raid.The fighting in this, is beyond awesome, it's awe inspiring, and if you think you will get bored of fight after fight, the little dramatic scenes, pack just as much of a punch, that you really care for these people.The writer/Director of this film clearly knows his action movies, as he has referenced nearly all the prolific action movie makers in one sense or another.I thought before seeing this, it was way over-hyped, and i was wrong, it deserves it's reputation. Like a musical, the fighting is wonderful to look at as well as hear.Easily the best action movie in the last fifteen years.",

            "content": "This movie takes Hollywood action movies and slams them to the floor leaving them out for the count, and it even picks up Chinese action movies and does the same to those. This movie is nothing short of spectacular. It is pure and raw action from start to end.The story in \"The Raid: Redemption\" is about a group of Indonesian SWAT members infiltrating a building to take down a drug ring and the boss. But things are just a bit too easy and not every police man in the Indonesian force is working with a clean conscience.The story, despite it being quite simple, was so amazingly captivating that there wasn't a single boring moment throughout the entire movie. It was so amazingly well put together and planned that it just worked on a great level. The movie just kept on rolling at a great pace, wrecking havoc and destruction in its wake. Sure, the story was predictable, but it was really great entertainment from start to end.As for the action sequences, which is the prime motor of this movie, well then it just knocks the air right out of you. It is spectacular, and similar to Thai action movies, where there is no wires, no staged action, it is all raw, physical, hard-hitting action. And when the punches and kicks connects, you can see that it is hard and must be painful. And that really makes this (as well as Iko Uwais previous movie, \"Merantau\") work so well.I enjoyed \"Merantau\" a lot, and it put Indonesia on the Asian movie market for me, and especially Iko Uwais impressed me. Then come this movie and totally unset the balance. It is without a doubt the most intense and best action movie - both in and out of Asia - that I have ever seen. Forget about Jet Li, Jackie Chan, Chow Yun Fat, Bruce Lee or Johnny Nguyen, Iko Uwais is a fast-rising star in the martial arts movies. If you like the Thai action star Tony Jaa, then you will also like Iko Uwais.It should also be said that Yayan Ruhian (playing Mad Dog) really is showing off impressive fighting in this movie as well. It is not all done by Iko Uwais. And it was nice to see Uwais and Ruhian bumping heads and fighting one another again (as they also bumped heads in \"Merantau\").\"The Raid: Redemption\" (though personally, I think the 'Redemption' part of the English title is unnecessary) is a movie that you have to watch if you enjoy Asian action movies (or action movies in general), because it is an adrenaline-filled, action-packed movie unlike anything else. And not only that, then it is also the most graphically and visually brutal action movies that I have seen. There are so many fight scenes where you just go \"oooh\" or \"ouch\" as Iko Uwais plows through bad guys with a knife. And the gunfight scenes are really impressive as well.It took me a while to get around to actually sit down and watch this movie, which was a huge mistake on my part, because this movie is explosive. Watch it! Trust me, you will not be disappointed! I love Asian cinema and have seen countless of Chinese, Hong Kong, Thai, Korean and Japanese action movies, but \"The Raid: Redemption\" totally wiped the slate clean and went straight to the top. This movie is impressive in every way; Indonesian martial arts movies throw a mean punch!",

Scenes which include the lead hero taking on over 20 recruits at a time and confidently killing them all, or where the lead takes one recruit and dives out the window satisfyingly killing him.

            "content": "This movie comes fresh and straight from Indonesia and pleases or displeases the viewers with many brutal killing scenes, some rough but technically well performed fights and a couple of breathtaking stunts at a full speed pace. This movie is surely nothing for soft-heartened people as there is a lot of blood in the film that one isn't used to from the Western cinema industry. It's also thanks to its radical execution that the movie surprisingly rose to international fame. People aren't looking for beautiful male actors, cool dialogues and romantic side stories anymore in action movies. This movie simply goes back to the simplistic basis with a rough kind of energy.The only modern touches this movie kept were two twists. Any movie of any genre seems to have the need to include at least one twist towards the end. I don't know why this trend degenerated but I think this tendency gets more and more overused. This movie contains one extremely predictable twist and another less predictable but still not impressive one. They desperately want the movie to get more depth and character development but the effect is the opposite.The movie itself takes no prisoners. We see the main actor praying and training for the first two minutes of the movie. The next three minutes are dedicated to a short introduction that explains what will happen during the next one hour and a half. A well trained but mostly unexperienced special unit police squad gets the suicidal task to infiltrate the fifteen floors of a dingy skyscraper in a rundown suburb of Jakarta's slums. The building has become a safe house for the city's most dangerous crooks. It's controlled by a very influential gangster boss and his two acolytes that represent the brain and the force to save, execute and extend their master's will. The squad tries to arrest as many villains as possible with the final goal being to arrest the big boss dead or alive on the final floor. The next circa ninety minutes show in dynamic camera angles with fast paced modern music a couple of tension filled hide and seek moments, a few more intriguing dialogues and mostly non-stop violence that portrays the tragic fate of twenty courageous good guys against hundreds of enemies. Not one second is wasted. This film will leave you out of breath. You may lose track of who people are, where people are and what they are exactly doing but it won't harm your (dis)pleasure about this movie.Now, what is so fascinating about a ninety minute long slaughter fest? What has made this movie's reputation? Is there more in this except of a pervertedly shocking violence? Yes, there is. First of all, there are the aesthetics. Every actor who played a member of the SWAT had to run through a hard training program to study the techniques used in the force including details such as hand signals. You can see this precise preparation in each second of the movie. The choreographic aspects are perfectly arranged, no matter if we see realistic martial arts sequences, fast stabbings or tension filled shooting passages from close and far.Second, many important characters have all something unique that makes the viewers feel against or with them. These trademarks can be seen in the moral or philosophical attitudes of the characters. You have the brutal fighter that refuses to simply shoot people as he prefers to fight his enemies from face to face and kill them with his bare hands. You have the peaceful outsider who risks his life to help some strangers because he has gone through hard times on is own before. You have a villain that has to make a tough decision between radical obedience, a smart putsch or a treason because of personal issues of his past. All these well developed characters will keep you on the edges of your seat until the end if you're not disgusted by the movie's brutality. As this movie is quite grounded without any big special effects makes the whole thing even more addicting, honest and real.Third, the movie has a lot of tension filled moments in between many breathtaking fight scenes. Suddenly, a killer slowly approaches the victims that are hiding behind the next or corner or behind a thin wall. Out of the blue, the lights shut down and the main villain starts to communicate with both his enemies and the building's ruthless residents. At another moment, the squad is all surrounded by villains and needs to find a fast, risky and smart solution to get out of this hell. There is always something happening in between fights and important dialogues.Normally, this movie would only get eight points from me because of its relative simplicity, its unnecessary twisted parts and the shallow ending. On the other side, this flick truly gave me a huge load of adrenaline and time passed by so fast that I deeply wanted to continue watching this. That's why I give it a little bonus point that I would rarely give. It doesn't happen quite often but this time I agree with critics and fans. This is by far the best action movie made in the last years. Any genre fan that doesn't mind some brutal stuff should call this his or her new bible.Hollywood should get inspired by this. Skip useless side stories, forced twists and billion dollar special effects. Don't dishonour this exotic effort by doing a shallow remake. People are tired of these things and would like to see some innovation from Hollywood again after many bad years with sequels and remakes. People don't want to see a remake with Jason Statham as tough cop and Johnny Depp as the weird villain. If you want to pay some tribute, go and ask actors like Iko Uwais or Yayan Ruhian to join \"The Expandables III\". Encourage the originals and the talented Asian cinema.",

Yes, The Raid from Merantau Films and XYZ Films has become global most-awaited action movie after won Midnight Madness Award on 2011 Toronto International Film Festival. Afterwards, Sony Pictures called for a Hollywood remake after got the rights for international release first including U.S. market on March 23, 2012 - same date for hometown release. An elite group of SWAT police officers receive a very difficult task, invade an apartment building that has been taken over by large network of dangerous criminals led by Tama. The chief Jaka with two of his reliable members, Rama and Andi moves one level to another, only to see their best plans being sidelined. Yet character revelations start bubbling to surface which should be done by a series of immense fights using guns, knives or even bare fists. Who will be the last man standing with less victims on his side? Director Gareth Evans continue his success from Merantau (2009) by upping the intensity in such bigger way. The location itself creates some unintentional claustrophobic atmosphere to make sure those cat and mouse fights have really nowhere to hide. Shaky-cam and quick cuts are used perfectly to maximize viewers' involvement into dynamic sense of rhythm. So, you feel like capture those moments with your own taste before transform 'em all into some certain reactions like grasp, goosebumps etc.Jakarta born, Iko Uwais clearly made the most gigantic impact with his extraordinary fighting skills on display which known as Pencak Silat, our very own traditional martial-art. Yeah, you might compare him with Thai's Tony Jaa from Ong Bak. Combined with cold-blooded Donny Alamsyah, the duo are serious combo to beat. High-experienced actor, Ray Sahetapy also nailed his role as a super villain Tama with slick face expressions and dreadful voice tones. Another name who stole the show is Yayan Ruhian whose crazy act as Mad Dog might be remembered by the fans of the movie for a long time.Violence is definitely an issue here, so it couldn't avoid to be rated R. Bath blood between one-on-one or group combatants are everywhere in the building. Sometimes you just don't see it clearly in front of your eyes because flashy editing from Evans are smart enough to present what should be seen or not without losing any meaning of it. \"Hardcore\" music scoring from Aria Prayogi and Fajar Yuskemal successfully brought the audience into silent mode for most of 101 minutes intriguing action with less predictable twists along the way.Even though the budget is fair low, approximately $1,1 million, it is effectively spent into every department of the movie. Basic storyline, however, outplayed by convincing choreography from the casts. The Raid is a non-stop action from start to finish, let the final battle alone is near flawless. Absolutely impressive to keep audiences on the edge of their seats, even still breathless when the credit titles rolling. A must-see in the cinema to feel some rare \"vibrant\" experiences. Respectful Evans has deliberately sent the message towards international viewers that lesser-known Indonesian movie industry is about to change in the next few years.http://databasefilm.blogspot.com",

The Raid: Redemption follows the story of Lieutenant Wahyu who leads a S.W.A.T team of commandos on a no-holds-bar mission to raid a twenty-story apartment building in search of a vicious drug kingpin named Tama. Fighting through an army of gangsters. The team find themselves faced with overwhelming odds as they left fighting with limited ammunition and use of incredible Martial arts skills. This intense film features the cast of Iko Uwais, Joe Taslim, Donny Alamsyah, Ray Sahatapy, Yayan Ruhian, and many others.Action has been among one of my favorites genres in Hollywood. The action genre has come a long way with films like Die Hard, The Rock, Face/Off, The Matrix, The Bourne Identity, and the recent Mad Max: Fury Road. This foreign films is a rare action thriller that shows a textbook example of how action flicks should be done. The action sequences consisting of intense and bloody gun shootouts and electrifying martial arts fights are incredible and exciting to sit through. Baring some resemblance to the fight scenes in 'The Matrix', these scenes display some outstanding choreography, and the camera-work done by hand-held camera is quite striking as it captures the pure intensity of the scenes instead of bloating the action with ridiculous shaky cam that many action films suffer from. The final fight scene during the last fifteen minutes can easily be held as one of the greatest fight scenes ever put on screen. The plot also works pretty well and remains intriguing for most of (if not the whole) thanks to its powerful pacing. The character on the other hand, could use some improvement. Iko Uwais's character is decent and solidly written as well as Ray Sahatapy's character Tama, the drug lord who the SWAT team pursues after. The rest of the characters lack depth and little to nothing to known about them other them being elite SWAT members. The Raid: Redemption is one of the best action films I have seen in a long time, and a film every action fan must see. It is very fun and pulse-pounding to watch, and there is never a dull moment. However, the film is definitely not for the squeamish as it gets extremely violent and bloody from start to finish.

The stunts are completely insane in scale. The film is violent, and very gore bloody full action movie!!!! I haven't seen that kind of action martial arts film in any cinema. The most martial arts Hong Kong action films are from the 80's and barely 90's, but in 2011 there was this astonish Indonesian perfect martial arts action film. The violence the blood, the gory and action everything is perfect.The movie starts fast paced, entertaining with a plot story, you can go in to the story without hesitation and you are hooked up on the seat.A SWAT team takes it upon themselves to bring down a highly crime lord; the team enters a 30 floor apartment building in the middle of the ghetto where the crime lord is known to operate from. Once the SWAT team makes it to the fifth or sixth floor, the crime lord learns of their infiltration. The lights go out. The exits are blocked. Only then do we realize that the inhabitants of the apartment building are lethal gangsters, hit men, crazies and cop-killers. The crime lord speaks briefly into the building's intercom: kill these unwelcome visitors- be sure to have fun doing so- and be rewarded. Then all hell breaks loose! The fighting sequences are expertly choreographed and insanely realistic. You can actually feel the pain of the people getting their bones snapped like twigs. And the pacing and editing of the movie is simply phenomenal. Think of it as Tarantino bloody violent action film! An elite swat team has to fight their way through an apartment complex-turned-safe house full of Indonesia's most dangerous killers and gangsters in order to take down the notorious drug lord that runs it. From start to finish, I was on the edge of my seat, awestruck by the brutality and bloodshed that emanated from every scene. In the end, you're not going to walk away talking about how memorable the characters were or how well-developed the plot was. No, you're going to walk away feeling entirely breathless, almost as if you just got smacked upside the head with a shot of pure adrenaline. This is the kind of movie that doesn't pull any punches. It goes right for the gore and only gets more deliriously wild and intense from there. If you're a huge fan of action flicks like me, I urge you to watch \"The Raid: Redemption\". Yes, it's a foreign film with English subtitles, but believe me, it's well worth seeing. It's a slick, deranged, no-holds-barred astonish action seat movie, that'll knock your socks off and leave you speechless.This movie kicks ass! Iko Uwais as Rama police officer member of the SWAT team kicks ass and the fight scenes of no hold barred are astonish and very fast paced realistic.The only problem with the film I do have and why I gave it a 8 is because: there was a less shootout scenes, I was excepting more shout outs and used more automatic gun plays and hand guns. I was excepting the movie would be more mixed martial arts action film in a John Woo's---Style Hard Boiled, I was excepting more explosions not just one. Mostly I wanted that only one member of the SWAT team survives and not three, that would be perfect just like in Die Hard. I wish Rama would not had any help by fighting Mad Dog (Yayan Ruhian) with his brother Andi (Donny Alamsyah) if those scenes would be cut the movie would have been much better and I would gave it a perfect 10. That Rama would have killed single handily drug lord leader Tama (Ray Sahetapy). I was also excepting that Tama would fight more with Rama not that he would be shot in the head by Wahyu (Pierre Gruno). At least that is my problem with the film that is why I prefer the sequel The Raid 2: Berandal (2014) over The Raid: Redemption (2011) because it had everything in it, that I was excepting in this film, it was in the next sequel film.The positive things about this film is that he saved Bowo (Tegar Satrya) and he arrested Wahyu (Pierre Gruno) and he did not killed them, he saved two people including his brother.Anyway this movie is what it is, a perfect 8, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry and martial arts choreographer.The Raid: Redemption (Indonesian: Serbuan Maut, meaning The Deadly Raid; also known as just The Raid) is a 2011 Indonesian martial arts action film written and directed by Welsh filmmaker Gareth Evans and starring Iko Uwais.8/10 Grade: B+ Studio: PT.

It is one of those movies that I always suggest to people that are into action, but they would like to watch something different than the usual blockbuster. Gareth Evans here achieved greatness in terms of choreographies and fighting scenes and remains in my humble opinion one of the greatest movies of its genre in recent years. There are interesting and unusual camera angles, lots of experimentation and absolutely beautiful fighting scenes that simply you can hardly beat. This film is very gruesome, it is not scared to show raw visuals, as it should be. Practical effects are amazing and the sound design is always on point. There was a lot of creativity and passion involved in this project. For sure this film left his mark and even after 10 years, it is still an extremely valid and unique production that sets a really high bar.",

The choreography is beautiful, cinematography over the top (so creative and still always on point), the editing is astounding. I've watched a lot of martial arts movies but this one made me feel the pain more than any other movie I've ever seen. You know the feeling when your body twitches with the action?

            "content": "Marketing is a strange beast; the goal is to get everyone talking about your product, getting excited about it and making the effort to see it. As a viewer though this can be counterproductive because sometimes the hype can overwhelm expectations and produce disappointment when the film turns out to be only \"good\" and not the most amazing thing ever made. With The Raid I think I may have got caught up in the hype because I did make the effort to see it whenever I got the chance and was very aware of the many gushing reviews and claims of being greatest action movie for decades etc \u2013 in fairness it is hard not to be disappointed when this is rattling round in your head and sadly I was a little disappointed.I'll start with the negative aspects. Firstly, although the plot makes for a very punchy and simple one line pitch, it does still manage to be unnecessarily messy and has aspects that it throws in with surprisingly clumsy touches. Rama having a personal interest in the mission is just announced without much in the way of explanation is one example but so are other narrative devices; OK this is a film where plotting isn't perhaps the most important aspect, but this should have made the job easier and make these clunky aspects all the more annoying. As writer Evans owes a debt to other films for the structure and concept but unfortunately he hasn't managed to capture an atmosphere that makes his film stronger. Films like Die Hard and others have used closed environments to really elevate the tension outside of the action sequences, but here I don't think Evans really manages to do it. Early in the film perhaps, but it is not sustained and as the action really kicks off it does lose a certain feeling of urgency.Although these weaknesses exist, fortunately the film does really deliver when it comes to excessively violent and brutal fight sequences. Evans sits back off the majority of the action and doesn't resort to rapid editing to make it seem fast and furious \u2013 in this case it really does feel intense and impacting without using this device. The martial arts is impressive but it is all the better for being brutal, furious and full of pain for everyone involved; while there are moments of individual violence that made me winch and look away, generally the level is about right because it constantly reminds us that this is an intense fight for survival and helps us forget it is just a film while we are watching. The cast impress in this regard and in particular I like the sequences with Ruhian, Uwais and Taslim in action. As actors perhaps they do not quite come up to standard but still they command the screen when it comes to the physical action.Overall, The Raid is an enjoyable martial arts film with plenty of brutally violent and engaging fight sequences that cover for the weaknesses in storytelling and atmosphere. If you go in full of hype these weaknesses may seem more important than they are (as they did with me) but ultimately it is the action that you came for and, as much as I would have liked to have more of an atmosphere through the film, it is here where the film generally delivers.",

            "content": "'THE RAID: REDEMPTION': Four Stars (Out of Five) Indonesian action/horror film teaming director and writer Gareth Evans with star Iko Uwais (the two also teamed on the 2009 Martial Arts action film 'MERANTAU'). Like their first collaboration this film is filled with fight scenes featuring the Indonesian Martial Art pencak silat, choreographed by stars Uwais and Yayan Ruhian (who plays the villain of the film). It tells the story of a rookie SWAT team tasked with bringing down a viscous mobster residing in a fortress like apartment building, protected by drug dealers and killers. The movie is extremely violent and dark but it's also one hell of a thrill ride. Action and Martial Arts fans are sure to be delighted.The majority of the film is set in an apartment building in Jakarta's slums. It houses some of the most vicious and ruthless criminals and killers in the area and their lead by mobster Tama Riyadi (Ray Sahetapy). A rooki SWAT team is assigned to enter the building (that even the cops are afraid to step foot in) and bring Tama to justice. What they don't know is that the mission has been put together solely by the corrupt Lieutenant Wahyu (Pierre Gruno), with his own agenda, and no reinforcements will be sent in to assist them if needed. Tama knows this and surrounds the building with his thugs trapping the police inside to be killed one by one. A battle ensues as the film focuses on one strong willed Muslim cop named Rama (Uwais) as he struggles to survive the onslaught of death and carnage.Like I said the film is graphically violent and gruesome and the tone of the film very much leans towards the horror genre. It also plays out very much like a violent video game with attackers continuously piling out of apartment rooms as characters move through various floors (levels). It's a little too dark for my taste but it is a fun ride nonetheless. The fight scenes are brilliantly choreographed and the action is spectacular. Of course none of it is the tad bit realistic but movies like this aren't supposed to be. It's a visceral ride, a very violent one at that. The director and stars are sure to move on to bigger and better things and the film is already set for an American remake and two sequels!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh674mS5vTo",

This movie relies and is driven only on action and action only.The movie works because of many reasons. one.. it is pure commercial modern action flick which doesn't give room for any drama or lazy moments where we don't look at screen and stare at the person sitting to our left or right..it simply captures you from the very beginning and till end. Second..The story works in favor of the movie and a damn good screenplay keeps the audience in its grip. I think Hollywood production companies can take some serious money management lessons on how to make decent and entertaining movies without spending too much. As far as i know this movie has been shot in a very small budget not because of the unknown cast but because of the sensible direction and treating the script accordingly and not experimenting with the basic rules of action cinema i.e. you deliver or go make drama...!! The camera-work is great and fighting sequences has been shot beautifully and you don't feel that you have missed anything at all in those fight scenes. Also actors have done a superb job and you will see that the movie overall is better then you contemporary Hollywood action flick...!! Many action scenes will drop your jaw. Though the highlight of the movie is the final clash between Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhian who stole the show with their stunt choreography but other actors and stunt men have also done a superb job. Mike Shinoda has done a great job with the background score and it add sparks to the whole action sequences.Gareth Evans has done a good job in Direction as well as in Editing also.There is a lots of scope in Asian cinema..and people who will see this movie they will realize how much more Asian cinema can offer them they just need the right people willing to invest in their projects..it is not just about HK or chines or Japanese cinema there is much more to be explored yet.What Tony Jaa flicks like tom yum goom and ong bak did to Thai Movie Industry..The Raid will do to Indonesian Movie Industry.I think this is the best action movie i have seen in this year so far and i hope i will see the sequel very soon!! Though there will always be better movies but despite its limitations it delivers So this is a very entertaining movie and a treat for action fans.my rating 10/10..A Must Watch.",

            "content": "Well, there are actually some quite helpful Youtube channels when it comes to movies in that they actually make recommendations for films that tend to slip under the radar. This is one of those films, and the fact that it came out of Indonesia is certainly one of the reasons that I wouldn't have heard of it, nor would I have thought of actually watching it. Another thing is that it appeared on the SBS streaming service in Australia, which meant that when it came around to watching an SBS film, I pretty much took this one straight away.So, there is this building in the middle of Jakarta which happens to be controlled by this gang and it is basically impenetrable. However, the cops decide they want to take it down, though there are suggestions that things aren't quite above board, especially when the boss suggests that cops can be bought where as rival gangs need to be dealt with. Well, when I say that it is impenitrable is certainly is because the cops get taken out pretty quickly, though a handful survive, and they realise that they need to get out.The entire action pretty much takes place in the building (though there are a couple of scenes outside), so you could say that this film follows the unity of time, place, and action. Well, there is an awful lot of action in the film, and I certainly wonder how they managed to make this film without half of the actors actually getting injured. In fact, I suspect that there were an awful lot of injuries in this film - it certainly is nowhere near as tame as some of the American films that you tend to get.The other thing is the martial arts. At first I thought that this film was simply going to be a lot of machine guns going off, but the thing is that the cops that do manage to survive end up without any weapons, so they need to resort of their fists. In fact, I never expected an Indonesian film to have such hard core martial arts in it, and this movie certainly doesn't let you down in that regards, especially as you get closer to the end.Yeah, this film is pretty cool, especially if you really like your action, and have been yearning for some of that old school Hong Kong action which certainly seems to have gone by the wayside of late. I can't necessarily say that Indonesia has picked it up, but with this being the first Indonesian film that I've seen, I have to admit that I really like what has come out. It also reminds me that sometimes some of these movie recommendation channels on Youtube are worth checking out, especially if you want something slightly different to the norm.",

How wrong I was and I have my brother to thank for ensuring I saw this groundbreaking piece of cinematic history. This movie has hands down the most brutal, violent and bone- crunchingly realistic fight scenes I've ever witnessed (and I've seen them all!). But what is a great fight scene if the story is weak and/or we do not care about the characters? Gareth Evans manages to tell us what we need to know without meandering or time-wasting and gets on with the business of making a great action movie. The characters are all easily recognisable after a short period of time and you find yourself routing for them (people cheered in my cinema!) when they are involved in combat. The villains are fantastic and are beautifully crafted as the monsters you want them to be. Interestingly they are more than a match for our heroes, which makes for very exciting viewing as you never quite know who is going to come off best from an encounter. This movie is very special indeed, it has shown that in a cinematic world of big names and big budgets sometimes all that is needed is a little talent. No doubt Hollywood will be all over this and will make a remake staring Tom Cruise or Sam Worthington. My advice to you is to watch this first and see a truly groundbreaking, original and damn exciting movie - the likes of which I can assure you you've never seen before!",

It reminded me of the start of Saving Private Ryan in the apprehension it evokes. It is exceptionally well acted and the suspense is unbearable. I challenge any one to watch it all the way through without once having to turn away. I like the lead actor very much. Uko Uwais is a fine actor and athlete. Mad Dog is very charismatic and also played very well by Yayan Ruhian. These Indonesian actors are great at what they do and amazingly physically fit. The screenplay is very tight and the cinematography is often breathtaking despite the appalling violence. Gareth Evans is a very fine movie maker. Some of the techniques used simply demand your respect. The pulsing sound indicating impending evil is far more effective than scary music too. The way Evans keeps you in suspense through such horrific scenes is awe-inspiring. Martial arts and the fetishistic violence is definitely not my thing but good cinematography is my thing and I would like to see Gareth make some other kind of movies. The suspense is riveting. The look of fear on the hero's face puts tingles up the spine. You flinch at every blow and the sinister ambiance is brilliantly evoked with such lines as \"I'll go call the neighbours. You have visitors. You know what to do\" (spoken by the boss villain). The timing is superb. Hollywood despite its frequent gratuitous violence tends to sanitise things; much in the same way as Americans say they are going to the bathroom when they mean they are going to perform a bodily function. Bathroom? Really? We non Americans have a shower in the bathroom. That sanitising tendency extends to movies where the shot people lie conveniently and un-confrontingly dead or more typically miraculously absent from the scene. In these Raid movies they moan and scream and wriggle around on the floor afterwards. It lends an air of realism, even in these fantastical scenes of epic violence. For example when a dead body is dragged into the lift it leaves a trail of non-blood moisture on the floor. Touches like this although nauseating are at least honest in their unflinching gruesomeness. There is also a lot of black humour in lines like \"You don't shoot cops. You pay them.\" This is an excellent movie. Although I could hardly wait for it to end I could not tear my eyes away. Its brilliant but appalling.

            "content": "Exhilarating action film, with martial arts fight sequences that take your breath away (I was exhausted just watching them!), featuring a police raid into a massive apartment complex ran by a paranoid drug lord with an army of dope fiends, gunmen, and fighters ready to attack. Iko Uwais is the featured star, as Rama, a rookie cop with a pregnant wife and a brother (Donny Alamsyah) who is actually working for the drug-lord (Ray Sahetapy). The drug-lord has been expecting a raid sooner or later due to his connections with members of the corrupt police department (he has evidence of these connections, damning to those in the dept who need this information kept secret). Pierre Gruno is a cop responsible for the raid, secretly plotting to secure the drug-lord for his own devious purposes (briefly; it doesn't take long before his sergeant (Joe Taslim) realizes how dirty he is), with eyes on moving up the ladder in his police department, sitting at the same corrupt table as his superiors. Equipped with an army of dirtbags, Sahetapy remains bunkered in his security room at the top of the tower-like run-down apartment complex, using the intercom to talk to his men and the police who aren't killed towards the beginning (when picked off unexpectedly). Included in the mix is Yayan Ruhian, a rather small fellow but a ruthless, extremely fast, and tireless assassin with fighting skills that have no equal (at least not in a fair fight). Yayan's fight with Joe is really amazing to watch and isn't quite a long as it feels\u0085this is an example of just how vicious and unrelenting a fighter Yayan is. Yayan being able to withstand (for the majority) of a lopsided fight with not only the hero of the film, Iko, but Donny also just further proves how freakish he is. He seems to have countless energy and stamina, a force of nature, this Yayan. Seeing Iko combat fighter after fighter, down countless halls, through rooms, out windows, doors exploding, tables breaking or working as weapons, bodies just twisting and turning, flipping and flying, hands and legs moving so quickly you can barely see them, The Raid: Redemption gets the pulse a raising and adrenaline rising. The apartment complex is like this dilapidated fortress where men seem to be hiding in every room, up the stairs, down the stairs, ready to surface at any moment, with Iko always having to stay alert or else. The brothers reuniting is a nice little subplot, especially considering how one is a cop and the other a criminal. There's a really nifty suspense sequence where Iko and his partner Tegar Satrya are hidden behind the wall of a tenant's apartment as a group of the drug-lord's killers look for them (the use of a machete stuck in the wall, across Iko's face, is milked for all its worth). The ways some of the fight scenes seem to go as one uninterrupted take are phenomenal. The fighters and stunt personnel responsible for these action sequences (when people are thrown into objects, against walls, and to the floor, they look unforgiving, impactful, believable, and painful), along with the choreography and staging of them deserve a round of applause and countless accolades. The setting is a character unto itself, a very dangerous locale for any man of the badge to enter uninvited. What's really cool is that Iko is actually a decent actor, so he isn't just a hire in the film for his magnificent fighting skills but has acting chops as well! When you see a villain lifted off his feet, swung across the room, his body smashing into a wall, with rotted paint chips and dust shaken away, with the final thud to the floor, it is to be celebrated for just how willing some are to sacrifice themselves for our entertainment. What a movie!",

The operation will be anything but simple though; just about everybody in the building is loyal to the criminals or too afraid to defy them. To make matters worse it soon becomes apparent that the lieutenant who ordered the raid didn't get authorisation so there will be no chance of back up if things go wrong\u0085 and they soon go very wrong! Most of the police are soon dead and those who aren't are out of ammunition; if they are to make it out alive they will have to rely on their wits and their martial arts skills.Most action films spend time introducing characters then have prolonged stops for exposition along the way; not 'The Raid' though. After a brief introduction to protagonist Officer Rama and a very quick explanation of who the bad guys were the raid began and once it had started the action hardly ever stopped! This wasn't CGI special effects and exploding helicopters; it was physical action that will leave you wondering just how many stunt men got injured making the film! Writer/director Gareth Evans did a great job bringing the story to the screen; the action is perfectly choreographed and the actors do a fine job.

And these are fight scenes that must be seen to be believed. Incredible camera work places you directly in the fight, giving the viewer the authentic feel of being in the room while two (sometimes three) men engage in a visceral exchange of body blows from lightning-fast limbs. Each fight scene strains (often snaps) credibility, as no human being would be able to stand after one of these punishing sessions. Yet there's the main character (you'll know the hero when you see him), moving from one off-the-wall fight to the next, maiming bad guys in groups.But that's what makes \"The Raid\" so incredibly watchable. It doesn't take long to go from raid movie to superhero film, as the numbers of the SWAT team drastically dwindle, and we're left with the main guy to do all of the ass-kicking. And he does it with a tremendous sense of heroism; we desperately want this guy to succeed and make it out of that building. So the unrelenting violence and brutality are easier to digest when the audience is overwhelmed with the fist-pumping satisfaction of seeing the superhero clean out the scumbags standing in his way. Unrealistic? Yes, times a thousand. But son of a bitch if it didn't make for one hell of a ride.8/10",

The fighting choreography in this is unlike anything I have ever seen. Now I might screw up some of the characters and their names here, but that's only because they are relatively unknown. Iko Uwais is the main actor in this and according to his bio on IMDb, he is a Taiwanese Silat champion and has been studying it since 10. It shows. His skill is eye popping, truly incredible. And then there's the main villain in the film, who I think is Mad Dog. He's played by some dude named Yahan Ruhian. He is just as impressive, if not more than Uwais. Another martial artist named Doni Alamsyah makes up a trifecta of gifted martial artists. The last battle is a three way as Uwais and Alamsyah team up to fight Ruhian. It truly left me breathless and I clapped in the empty theatre when it was done. I don't know how they did it, but if you think you have seen incredible martial arts battles before, this one will put it to shame.The story? Who cares. Crimelords in Jakarta trap a bunch of SWAT team members in a building and all freakin hell breaks loose.

As soon as the ferocious action begins I am that, yes, I realised this was what the film was about (a clue is in the title) but can this hold my attention for forty minutes? Actually, although the trick here is not to cut to other activity or pause for a romantic interlude but instead to vary the instruments of war. So, from the automatic weapons of the opening we go all the way to extreme hand to hand and foot to foot martial arts and there is little time to stop to think. We even switch heroes to ring the changes and develop the story a little.

Early on we learn that there may be some other motives behind the orders given by the lieutenant. Things go well as they make it up to floor 6. Then they are discovered. What follows is a good half an hour of exhilarating shoot-out/fistfight scenes in which the inexperience will cost the team dearly. Bodies fly all over the place like sacks of potatoes and there are plenty of mean ways of killing.As we get to know some of the characters involved- some good-natured cops, one of whom is related to one of the mobster's captains- suddenly the movie becomes a wild and remarkable martial arts movie as hordes of goons attack the few surviving cops. The movie loses steam at some point but manages to pick it up again as the meanest of the captains is also almost unbeatable in his martial arts skill. The movie doesn't shy away from unfair fights. The mean captain is a tiny tiny guy but he isn't afraid to take on two guys at the same time.The Raid is an outstanding action movie. It is polished and exceptionally well directed. But when it comes to the action, it sticks to proved basics. There isn't lighting trickery, booming sound effects, supernatural wire-work- just lightning fast punches and kicks, and millions of bullets. And these punches hurt, this aren't the gentle ones found in the Matrix trilogy. One just has to see the long list of health care professionals listed in the credits. The story is rather thin and the production doesn't make enough use of it. I think more could have been done with the story. I found the police action shootouts superior to the martial arts action. You do become exhausted of the martial arts fights eventually. The Raid is to Indonesia what Ong-Bak was to Thailand, it could put Indonesia on the map for action movies. Hopefully they'll take advantage of it. Kudos to the entire cast and the director who turned what could have been an average movie into something unforgettable.",

Martial artist Iko Uwais plays a police officer who, along with a small task force, attempts to conduct a police raid on an apartment complex teeming with gangsters and drug lords. Our heroes sweep and clear each level of the complex, until a final showdown with an evil boss and his deranged henchman.The film's by-the-numbers plot unfolds like levels of a video game, but Evan's direction and action choreography help elevate things somewhat. He knows when to slow things down and build suspense, and the film's choreography is often impressive. Unfortunately the film's better qualities quickly get bulldozed by pornographic levels of gore and violence, characters existing solely as ragdolls to be headshotted, decapitated, gratuitously stabbed or bathed in computer generated blood and/or exit wounds. To mitigate the film's baseness, Evans then adds some hilariously sentimental flashback sequences, in which our macho men think about their wives and newborn babies. Two decades ago, John Woo habitually did the same, cutting back and forth between massacres and kids or churches. Woo was a Christian. Evans is a docile family man. Both felt the need to up the ante in contemporary movie violence.4/10 \u2013 Nirvana for a certain type of action fan, \"The Raid\" was shot on a small budget and with a small crew of amateur actors.

You just can't have one without the other, usually we get the first one, but rarely the second. This applies equally to a regular action movie or, in this case, one of the martial arts type. When you end up watching a good action movie you will remember these two things: the action sequences and the characters.In the case of the Raid, you might remember several of the fight sequences, all of these very well made, from the stunt men to the direction and editing. Now here comes the problem, you are not going to remember a single character, and if you do, do you remember their motivations? See, in an action movie, both the good guys and the bad guys need motivations to fuel what they do. You could say this applies to any other movie as well. For the sake of keeping things simple, an action movie doesn't need complex motivations, but at least it needs the most basic ones in order to make us care about what is going on.The Raid lacks characters with motivations, so all we are left with are extended action sequences that go on and on. The movie suffers from this mantra of \"more is better\" and it throws away proper pacing in exchange for non-stop senseless and aimless action sequences. Is not enough to have people shooting and fighting and stuff exploding, you need something behind the mayhem. The Raid gives us nothing, no character to care about. Every single character is interchangeable.It has become a clich\u00e9 to say that a movie sometimes looks like a video game, and it's ironic considering how hard many games these days try to look like a movie. The Raid truly feels like a game, one in the vein of those arcade beat em ups like Final Fight, Double Dragon, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, Streets of Rage and so on. We get a brief intro, usually a girl being kidnapped, we get a hero to choose and there you go, beat everyone on your path. Also, while you can forgive many things in the plot of an action movie, the movie just gets dumb for the sake of it. The bad guy has cameras everywhere, yet he can't pin a single guy, and he sends just a small group of people, none of them with guns. Some have machetes, but why would they want to use that when they could just gun down the few remaining good guys? Oh right, there wouldn't be any fight sequences left. Is like if in Die Hard Hans decided to tell his goons to look for Mclaine with knifes because that's more \"honorable\" or something like that.If you are an action aficionado you will dig this, no question about it, but i don't think you will remember much of it. Again, the fights are very well done, far better than in Merantau, but the emptiness of the story and the characters will just make you feel that way, empty. It's like a very tasty fast-food snack that just won't satisfy your hunger. Good for a while, but in the longer term, you want something that has more meat to eat.",

There is no character who just seems innately bad-ass and unstoppable(though Mad Dog comes close), you feel a certain genuine struggle to survive in the fights and the characters really do seem to be fighting for their lives.The initial plot seems simple enough, RAID a place and kill some guy. Yet the plot feels unpredictable, at times it seems like an unknown who will survive and what the goal of the whole mission really is, there's odd betrayals here and there that keep it unpredictable.I have not read anything about this movie, but it seems like a very low budget film, with only one mini-explosion taking place and not in a very clich\u00e9 manner but in one where the characters truly feel overwhelmed and it seems like a last resort. There is no restraint when it comes to gore either, with clear showing of bloody scenes which I tend to prefer.The focus of the camera work is probably my favourite thing in this whole movie, the fistfights in this movie feel raw because of it, there is no endless cutting, jumping of the camera with every kick and punch like we've come to expect.Only reason why this isn't a perfect movie for what its trying to be is the convenient sequential manner with which enemies seem to pop(instead of all at once) and perhaps some odd decisions by characters to not pick up weapons on the floor and later complain that they are unarmed. With the exception of Mad Dog whose character stipulates this attitude.Overall, Fantastic action movie, highly recommended, though its a true action movie, with fistfights taking up a good portion of it, so perhaps people who are looking for more implied action than direct might not like this very much.",

My point is that this film have a high level of enjoyment in it, each scene keeps you suspended and entertained. The Raid is about a elite squad that's tasked to infiltrate a high-rise building that's run by a ruthless drug lord, we follow Rama who is the rookie but really the best as he's capable with firearms and his deadliest weapon, martial arts. It's a very basic story but Gareth Evans succeeds in every way and made an amazing action movie, also great directing on his part!The handheld camera technique works well here, the crew and ensemble cast made the film work. It's one of my personal favorite action movies as it truly have everything an action film should have. The crew have really done a good job at making the action feel real if it's the guns or the hand to hand combat, each fight is suspenseful and powerful. The musical score helps with that aswell, making it flow well with the fights and choreography that the stunt coordinator did a magnificent job with.I wonder how they pulled off some things in this movie, like that fridge scene. There's also a fight sequence, a long one with Rama and Andi against Mad Dog. It's totally unrealistic but so good, like bloody great. Superb! I could watch that for hours because of the fight choreography that they had to learn.Iko Uwais is Rama. What a great martial artist and action star, just wow.

Admittedly he only wanted to remember how the appropriate directing of half a dozen extras could appear like an army on screen.The Raid starts well with the sense that the building is the main character. As the SWAT team advances thru the first few floors, the movie is a tense thriller. Then the storyline forks, you no longer really care what floor you're on and fight scenes just happen along the way. The choreography is brilliant, the editing is great - save for the final fight which ridiculously last for minutes - but it's not the Assault thriller of the premise, it's only a Martial Arts tournament setting (Hello Bruce Lee).Another big flaw is to show the Big villain and his sidekicks. He is a nice actor but gets too much exposure whereas he should be melted with the building. His evil sense is as ludicrous as that of the Nicholson character in The Departed.

            "content": "Just became one of my favorite films.I don't know what to say other than, wow! This movie has some of the best action I have seen in a long time. Maybe ever. You can tell this movie was made by real martial artists who knew what they were doing and not only did they choreograph some absolutely spectacular scenes, but the way they filmed it was almost perfect. There is no overuse of shaky cam and there are no jump cuts and there are some really great long takes. The action is well framed, clear, and in the shot so we can see these fighters go to work. The camera work and cinematography definitely was impressive.The main character is set up in the beginning and the film wastes no time and tells us what we need to know so it can get to the point. The main character is badass and ballsy. You understand his motivations and who he is as a person and you can see that he knows he is in danger. Which is what makes this movie so good because it's like we are watching this guy genuinely fight for his life. Although he is the only character that you're really gonna give a shit about. There's not much depth or character development given to many of the characters.But, the action is able to tell the story. In fact, the storytelling within the action is some of the best I have seen. It is absolute carnage and mayhem at its best. The bad guys are given a few establishing scenes to show us they are bad. It's the cliche crime overlord villain. But the way the action plays out really does tell a story. It's extremely hard hitting and fun to watch. I was laughing and enjoying every second of it. There were so many times where I was like \"Damn!\" or \"Holy Shit!\" and just loving it all.Overall, The Raid is a really good movie and I recommend watching it. If you like action movies at all then you will love this movie. There are so many awesome fights that I went back the next day after I finished the movie and rewatched a bunch of them. This makes me really want to start getting into some Kung Fu movies. The plot of the movie is simple but the execution is what makes it really good. If you like action movies there is no way you won't find this film enjoyable.The scene where he is hiding in the wall was so well filmed. I was on the edge of my seat.There is a 2v1 fight that very well might be the best action scene I have ever watched.",

            "content": "The Raid: Redemption (2011) *** (out of 4) This Indonesian martial arts picture certainly isn't going to be for everyone but if you enjoy non-stop action, violence and blood then there aren't too many better films out there. The plot is pretty simple as a crime lord has an entire apartment to himself and he rents out rooms to the scum of the city. Even the police won't go into this area but that changes when a SWAT team is ordered to go in and take out the big guy. As soon as the police enter the building they're greatly outnumbered and have to battle dozens of thugs to try and reach the top. THE RAID: REDEMPTION is without question one of the best and most memorable martial art movies in a very long time. The film doesn't try to make you cry, make you think about life or change your life. Instead it just wants to keep you entertained and I can't think of a recent action film that had you so glued to what's going on than this one. We go through this non-stop maze of violence with a rookie cop (Iko Uwais) who is about to be a father in a few months so he really has a reason to want to get out of the building. Director Garth Evans does a wonderful job at keeping the film moving at a great pace but the style he brings to the film is something very special. You just get lost during all of the fighting scenes because they're so well shot that you're often wondering how long it took them to get them onto film. A lot of this stuff really does feel as if it would be impossible to get on film so that just draws you in even more. The performances by all are great, the visuals are terrific and the score is perfect. Everything on the technical side is done greatly but the real stuff is the violence. The movie has just about every kind of death scene you can think of as bodies are shot to pieces, cut to shreds and blood flows just like water would in a river. There are some pretty graphic shots here so of course some aren't going to be able to handle it but the craftsmanship is just so strong that even if you don't normally enjoy a picture like this you can still be won over by it.",

It is expertly made, and superior to most Hollywood fare. The first hour is a no non-sense, serious action, not about pretty boys ab-offs.

It switches between combat to story progression pretty well, slowly unraveling more to the story and its characters than what the viewers initally thought there was. The scenes don't beat around the bush and we're told only what we need to know of the world surrounding the Raid. Action scenes also vary from simply pumping to very intense. A very impressing display of skill and choreography, seeing this on the big screen would only add to its thrill and intensity.The only criticisim I would have for this is as members of a special force / elite cops, and the fact that they were considering this raid to be a big issue, the comrades of Rama (Iko Uwais) seem to lack the skill and preparation that elite cops must have, even if they were rookies. They were doomed from the start when there were moments of hestitation that could've resulted to less of the squad members being killed. Though it's not much of an error enough to change the film's quality. Perhaps the directors really attributed it to how inexprienced the squad was that led the raid to be doomed from the start.Having seen bits of this film years ago when it was still new, the story and action sequences are still as fresh as it was. Probably the only regret I have was not seeing this on the big screen.",

With that hype behind it there was a risk it could have disappointed, but it did not. The Raid is a very entertaining action film that will please fans of Tony Jaa, Bruce Lee and martial arts films in general. Like The Avengers it made of impressive action scenes followed by impressive scenes, the highlight being the hallway fight with Iko Uwais stabbing his way through the badguys. Uwais is a great martial artist but he is not made out to be superhero, people can hit him, he can feel paid and Yayan Ruhian too is also a very talented fighter. The action is bloody and brutal, but director Gareth Edwards not linger or enjoy pain: he gets the right balance to satisfy our blood lush. Edwards uses an instant hand-held style that lets you feel the frenzy of the fights and action, but the fights themselves well shot, well edited and you can tell what is happening in the film. There is no need for shaky cam. At times the film plays like a survival horror with the criminals coming at the police like zombies, stabbing through walls like a slasher villain or jumping out apartments like in the Resident Evil games. The Raid also plays like the Warriors as gangs hunt our heroes for a main guy. The Raid is an entertaining film.",

The Indonesian film about a S.W.A.T. team who gets trapped during a raid. The style of the film is different than modern action films. I say that because the fight scenes are not interrupted by anything. No funny one liners, no cut to Megan Fox, nor brilliant scenes of dystopic clutter. Where as an American director might want to emulate their inner Scorsese or Spielberg, Gareth Evans tries interesting mixes of shaky cam close ups, eagle eye, and wide steady cam. The stunt and prop team was phenomenal for this film. People genuinely seem like they are stabbed, beat, and shot. Speaking of guns, the film has plenty of them but as soon as people run out of bullets the film turns martial arts and showcases what Jakarta has to offer in terms of entertainment.The film suffers heavily in only one department, writing. The character development is at the third act. I was glad that there was the first scene to at least make me care about the main character who should feel like a one man army after all that he's done.The antagonist feels like a run of the mill bad guy. The writers make you hate him for the amount of carnage he ensues but he's lacking the complexity any human would have.The sound effects are awesome, each punch is highlighted in a loud thud that isn't cartoon-y like previous generations martial arts films. The music is thematic and adds to every scene. I can't emphasize the music enough to increase the feeling for every scene. The lack of music before a fight builds anticipation and showcases Gareth Evans' understanding of building suspense, Hitchcock style.Verdict: This movie deserves to be seen by those who can appreciate good martial arts. I watched the subtitled version of the movie. I cannot recommend watching the dubbed version, unless you're unable to watched subtitled films.",

            "content": "\u00a8Pulling a trigger is like ordering a takeout.\u00a8The Raid Redemption has gotten so many great reviews that I decided to check it out despite never having heard anything about it. I had never seen an Indonesian film before, heard of director Gareth Evans, nor star actor Iko Uwais, but I was tempted to see it after hearing it won the People's Choice Award at the Toronto Film Festival. At first I really thought this movie was just another Battle Los Angeles where we had nonstop action with over the top gunfights. I'm not really a fan of these movies which only focus on the action and have little plot, but I was really in for a surprise with The Raid. Once the gunfights stopped, the combat became more ferocious involving a lot of knives, machetes, and even hand to hand combat. I've seen a lot of martial art movies before, but this film really set the bar with all those choreographed fights. They were truly amazing and I really enjoyed the last hour of the movie. The Raid is an extremely violent film so it isn't for everyone, but if you enjoy martial arts then you will love this film. Iko Uwais makes any other martial artist look silly as he is really impressive on screen, but so was the rest of the cast. The martial art used in this film is the traditional Indonesian one called Pencak Silat and it's intense. Iko Uwais choreographed the fights himself along with another actor who had some great fighting scenes, Yayan Ruhian. Together they make the film worth watching even though it has very little dialogue or story. There's no time for talking, it's one fist fight after another.Rama (Iko Uwais) is a rookie SWAT officer who seems happily married along with his pregnant wife. We only see them together in the opening scene where Rama kisses them goodbye before going to work. He gets on the SWAT car along with twenty other elite officers led by Sergeant Jaka (Joe Taslim) and are given instructions: They have to infiltrate and raid an apartment building in the middle of an Indonesian slum full of gangsters and drug dealers. Their mission is to capture the crime lord Tama (Ray Sahetapy), but it won't be an easy task because the building is full of loyal free renters who will protect him at all cost. That is why the police force has never attempted to go near that building, but somehow Lieutenant Wahyu (Pierre Gruno) has ordered the raid and is waiting for them near the entrance of the building. Once the SWAT team breaks in, some local spotters warn Tama that the police have entered the building. Tama observes everything through cameras in the top floor and announces to the entire building that whoever kills these officers will be given special treatment. He even sends his two personal bodyguards, Mad Dog (Yayan Ruhian) and Andi (Donny Alamsyah), after them. The SWAT team find themselves ambushed between the sixth and seventh floor with nowhere to run. That is where the action begins and doesn't stop as all these renters keep on showing up while the officers fight for their lives.The plot is really simple, but believe me the choreographed action scenes are really not. That is what truly makes the movie for me: the hand on hand fighting scenes, especially those involving Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhian. They are a true spectacle. I had never seen a martial art film like this before with so much intensity and carried out for such a long time. The final hour is practically nonstop action. I would never in a million years expect to have enjoyed a film like this, but the fighting scenes were so incredible that I was willing to forgive the poor plot and just enjoy the choreographed martial art scenes. I hear a sequel is in the making, and I am sure I will be watching it to see what else Iko Uwais has in store for us. This isn't a movie I would recommend to everyone, but if you like a good choreographed action movie then this is the film you will want to see because it truly does raise the bar for martial art films everywhere.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",

            "content": "Recycling (for the most part) the same actors as Merantau, Gareth Evans second major martial arts flick was a brutal punch to the face when it came out, cementing itself as one of the darkest, most cringe-worthy martial arts films of all time. While I think this movie is good, low budget fun, it's also got a couple problems that overall hinder the otherwise entertaining experience.A large group of cops, including our hero Rama, are embarking on a sting operation. They enter a sixteen story tenement building owned by a crime lord who rents every room to criminals of all sorts. Everything is going fine for a few moments, but soon enough the cops are dropping like flies and Rama is fighting for his life to escape the building's lockdown.The movie is another example of starting slow but building up steam to get to that awesome climax. There are a couple really excellent fight scenes sprinkled throughout from the knife-wielding hallway fight, to Rama fighting three guys with machetes, to the final battle in a small cell against a guy whose erratic martial arts are perfect for a bad guy. It's brutal, it's entertaining, and it keeps you breathless.Here are my gripes, and they really aren't even that big a problem. The shaky camera is noticeable in certain areas of the film, and really annoying. That said, the action still retains its brutality and you don't miss a single blow. I know that shaky cam is a turn-off for a lot of people though, so I figure I should mention it. The other problem is the music. It's got a rock soundtrack that isn't exactly fitting. The Blu-Ray comes with two options, the original soundtrack or a musical makeover by Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park. Even the original music has unfitting rock music for moments that don't need it. When two snipers position themselves, we're assaulted by completely out of place drums and guitar.Despite this, the film is visceral, violent, and one of the most violent martial arts movies you'll ever see.",

And I grew up on a steady diet of Jean Claude van Damme movies and all the copy cats, so my former education in this genre ought to be sufficient I guess.I am not going into the plot,basically there is none and what there is is just a letterhead to get people into confined spaces where they can beat or shoot or mame the crap out of each other. When watching this movie my thoughts drifted away to another movie which had the same sort of rave reviews ( Laid to rest 2) which I also found a bit of a letdown. A completely different type of movie and genre ( this movie is far better made then laid to rest 2 will ever hope to be), but the same type of reviews promising - in that case- wall to wall gore. The problem I see with these type of movies is that there is no plot to speak of, just stages like in a video game where either a masked killer with a big knife ( laid to rest 2) or a guy who is REALLY good in kicking people asses gets into situations where he can do just that..again, and again, and again.Its in a sense like a porn movie compilation, you leave all the not needed tidbits out and go right to the money shot, and put as much of those as you possible can into the running time.Its a tiring experience to watch, and yes the main character - and basically all those involved- show an athletic skill that is off the chart but it gets repetitive..there just so many ways you can hurt someone with your bare hands, gun or knife. there is a parallel to the porn movie example I made somewhere here but I wont go into that.And what I sensed after an hour or so is that I just didn't give a crap anymore who was beating who to pulp and I completely lost interest by the time the two good guys were beating up one bad guy who didn't get down even after getting a healthy portion of a light bulb stuck in his neck; talking about dedication. there was a feeling that the director also lost track of the proceedings because before I knew it they entered the liar of the main bad guy without to much resistance and the movie was basically done( rather literally because it was announced that every bad guy could go home because the show was over??) I read in another review that this was comparable to John Woo's hard boiled and that is in a way correct, although Yun Fat Chow has a lot more charisma then this main character and the character development was on a level you actually gave a crap what happened. And that is saying something because John Woo is no thespian in the plot department.Of all the external reviews I found the one from Mr Ebert the most of my liking in the way that his experience was the same as mine.So is this a bad movie, not really, just get the right mindset and go with the brainless, plot less flow..and be amazed what people can do when trained in martial arts with their bodies and with other peoples bodies.",

The elite group of cops quickly (and silently) begin to raid the crime lord's apartment building, but they are soon discovered and one exciting, extended action sequence unfolds before our eyes.For starters, the film is captured perfectly by some impressive camera work, which always helps to keep us in the midst of the action. The background music also adds to the tension and is never distracting. The editing is also top-notch as well, which is unlike many of today's action films. All too often, the editing in these films will slack and the action scenes will become an incomprehensible mess. Thankfully, that is not the case in \"The Raid.\"The film's only weak spot, however, is its plot, which is a bit half-baked. As a result, there is minimal character development. Despite this, the cast still does well with their roles. However, the story isn't what made us watch \"The Raid\" in the first place. It's the fight scenes that caught our attention, and boy, do they deliver. Throughout the majority of the film, we witness gunfights, martial arts showdowns, and brutal takedowns. Expertly choreographed, the action scenes are viscerally intense and highly entertaining. Our hero Rama (Iko Uwais, operational driver turned actor), is the star here and he delivers throughout, dispatching thug after thug using the Malaysian martial arts technique \"pencak silat\".All in all, \"The Raid\" is one of the best action films ever released. Despite a mediocre plot, it succeeds at delivering thrills with its impressive camera work, mesmerizing choreography, and brutal and relentless action scenes. It might not appeal to everyone due to its intensity and carnage, but for action aficionados, this is sure to be a treat.9/10",

It is THE best, hands down.It's just extremely well done. There are so many amazing, tense sequences in here. I can't even begin to list them all. But the action is nonstop and feels very realistic. There is also some very good camerawork. The acting is good and the story is good, but it's really all about the action here. And even if you don't like subtitles, don't worry. There isn't all that much talking for most of the movie and you won't even notice it's subtitled after five minutes. Highly recommend.",

            "content": "We really need great big fat action-flicks like this one, at least once every couple of years, to remind us that the genre is still very much alive and still has plenty of originality and potential to it as well, as this small budget, Indonesian movie clearly demonstrates.It's really being a very simplistic movie, with both its settings and story but none of this really matters, since basically everything else is done so well.It's a very straightforward action-flick that features plenty of graphic violence in it as well. It's not only an action movie with lots of gunfights and explosions in it, it's also being a true old school material arts flick. And a really good one as well! All of the fights are very well choreographed and filmed and even features some moves that I had never seen before. It's also pretty extreme all, so expect lots of blood flying around and limbs getting crushed. This movie just doesn't ever hold back with any of its violence and it's basically being like a non-stop action spectacle.Perhaps the most surprising thing about this movie remains that it's an Indonesian production. A country that isn't exactly known for its cinema but this movie absolutely looks and feels like a big, multi-million dollar production, with lots of talent and experienced involved, both in front and behind the cameras. Nothing about this movie indicates that it got made with a fairly small budget and with not that many experienced people involved, while in fact this all was actually being the case. A true accomplishment from that perspective but also otherwise, this would had been a great movie to watch, with any sort of budget and language involved.And by saying that his movie does not have a whole lot of story in it, is perhaps not enough credit for this movie. They obviously at least attempted to give the movie some story, even while the entire movie is taking place in the same building. They even managed to give the movie some depth, also with its characters. It's true that its main storyline is a very simple and straightforward one but there is still plenty happening around it with its story and characters. It's really such a professional looking movie, with some great cinematography, editing and just overall style to it. It's brutal and graphic but not in an exploratory kind of way. In a way this movie is being more like a video game than a conventional action-flick perhaps.A great straightforward action-flick, that is a must-see for every lover of the genre, all over the world.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Cops go in to get a crimelord, they end up trapped, lots of fighting and shooting. The film puts fights and choreography before everything else and it is to its credit. Iko Uwais is an action sensation and also knows how to emote using his facial expressions. The fights flow lyrically and Evans always knows where to place the camera. No shaky camera business here. At times the fights did feel too controlled. I kept thinking to my self that I could have a few of these guys in a fight as I would have no qualms with punching their nuts. I know it's a silly nitpick, but the amount of exposed crotches would have lead to shorter fights. Not that I wanted this, but there are no rules when fighting for your life. The violence is well handled and it truly adds to the desperation of the situation, it doesn't try to gross you out but it does want you to feel the shots, stabbings, and punches. Evans also knows to give us a bit of a breather so we can appreciate those action scenes more. There are also a few \"how did they do that\" moments, which are getting rarer and rarer these days. Yes I wish I had felt more connected to these characters, but for the adrenaline rush it is, it's wonderful.",

            "content": "Sometimes, when you want a good solid action movie, you need to steer clear of Hollywood (and their current trend of PG-13, sugar-coated, spastically edited clones) and direct your attention to the other side of the world. In this case, Indonesia. From rising Welsh filmmaker Gareth Evans, THE RAID is a non-stop bloody explosion of martial arts awesomeness. This movie makes no apologies for what it is: a hardcore action film with a massive body count and cringe-inducing kills, with a bit of plot thrown in for flavor. THE RAID is less a movie and more a showcase for talented stuntmen and martial artists and brought together by a man with a passion for the genre. The premise for the movie is simple: Tama is a drug baron is holed up on the fifteenth floor of an apartment building where he oversees his empire, filling the building with junkies and thugs loyal to the cause. He's considered near untouchable, hidden in his fortress with aid from his adviser Andi and a vicious psychopath (referred to as Mad Dog\u0085for a reason). A SWAT unit finds themselves in the precarious position when assigned to bring Tama to justice. We follow rookie officer Rama, one of 20 officers assigned to the mission, as the building is raided and everything turns disastrous when a spotter sounds the alarm. With every thug in the building on the attack and his thoughts returning to his pregnant wife at home, Rama and his surviving fellow officers must survive the assault when they're trapped in the chaos without reinforcements.While, normally, I'd condemn the average mindless Hollywood action schlock, THE RAID gets a special pass for getting right what most American action films get wrong. There is an established plot in the film; it's thin, but it's there. A handful of cops are trapped in an apartment building surrounded by murderous lowlifes and must survive. Once the context is established, THE RAID is all about the action. From about 25 minutes into the film until the very end, this movie is non-stop action, with one sequence transitioning to another with a handful of exposition moments tossed in the middle to keep the story moving. Evans is a longtime fan of the martial arts genre and proves he has a talent for putting action on film. He keeps the camera angles wider so we can witness a lot more of the action, whereas a lot of American action films keep the camera in tight, with fast-moving cuts that often keep the action confusing and disorienting. Evans wants none of that and he shows us every punch, kick, stabbing, etc. The fights are fast and brutal and, more importantly, bloody. None of this bloodless violence we're becoming more and more accustomed to in American action. When people are hit with bullets, knives, machetes, whatever\u0085we see the damage and we feel the impact. It's intense and it makes for some of the coolest fight sequences I've seen in recent years. It's not chockfull of special effects (and those that are utilized are not blatant) and glossed over; it's a handful of talented martial artists and some great choreography.You have to be a bit more open-minded to enjoy THE RAID. The movie is in Indonesian, so I hope you don't mind subtitles or voice dubbing. Another \"detriment\" to general audiences is a complete lack of recognizable faces in the roles. Evans cast the film with Indonesian martial artists, some of which have never even been in a movie before. Iko Uwais (Rama, the main character) is a Silat specialist (Silat = an Indonesian form of martial arts) who has currently only ever been in two films\u0085THE RAID and Evan's smaller first film MERENTAU. You'd never know that he's not a trained actor as he nails his performance in the movie, regardless of his fighting skills. He's sympathetic in his role as Rama with his sense of honor in his job and his unwavering confidence. The same with Yayan Ruhian as Mad Dog, a stuntman and fight choreographer that Evans enlisted as the insane henchman with an insatiable bloodlust. Mad Dog is the coolest character in the movie (despite being\u0085you know\u0085evil) with a cold- blooded nature and a hint of humor in Ruhian's performance. Overall, THE RAID is a killer action movie that's big on bloody violence and, while short on plot or exposition, accomplishes it's mission of thrilling it's audience with an mind-blowing display of martial arts talent thanks to a passionate director behind the scenes.",

            "content": "The Raid: Redemption is the most violent, ridiculously over the top action movie I have ever seen. It could be titled Violence: The Movie with complete accuracy. I don't think I've ever seen so many punches, kicks, and bullets before. And I know I've never seen so many furniture based attacks or men swung around by their legs. This is the kind of film that dares to ask if you can make a movie entirely out of shootouts, explosions, and martial arts, and it answers that question with a resounding yes. You can make that movie, and it will be awesome.Let me start with a little background. I first heard of this movie in a Robert Brockway column entitled \"The Most Baffling Subtitles in Foreign Action Movie History\" which detailed his experiences watching a poorly translated bootleg of the film. Reading his article, I knew that this movie was the kind of thing I had to see, even without lines like \"You must be rest because of both\" and \"After you see it I sat in s****y pants.\" I mean where else can you see a guy doing Kung Fu with a florescent tube sticking out of his neck?The brief excuse for a plot involves an elite squad of police launching a raid on a rundown high rise run by one of Jakarta's most notorious crime lords. As they approach the building we get an expository speech about the villain and his chief henchmen, who are made to sound powerful and dangerous beyond all belief. Then we see them; three guys in T-shirts, the leader eating a bowl of ramen. It would seem that his reputation is undeserved. Next we see him finish eating and casually execute half a dozen men, and that impression is immediately dispelled. Then the cops enter the building, and from there it's nonstop action and brutal violence.And I mean brutal. People are stabbed, shot, garroted, strangled, thrown through windows, crushed under filing cabinets and more. At one point a man is hoisted into the air by an axe embedded in his shoulder, slammed to the ground, then axed again. I lost track of the body count less than a minute after the first shot was fired. And there are many, many shots fired. Nor does the Raid stick to that old trope where hundreds of bullets are fired but the heroes don't get hit. Lots of heroes get hit, and most of them die. And the exploding fridge gambit was one of the most original maneuvers used in an action film. John McLane would be proud.If the shootouts and explosions are excellent, the fight scenes are unbelievable. Beyond the standard punch and kick, you have men somersaulting out of arm locks, swinging enemies across the room by their ankles, and delivering spinning kicks to the back of heads. Heroes easily hold off three or more adversaries at a time, turning their attacks against them and impaling them on their allies weapons. This movie doesn't have time for the one at a time attack rule. The blows and parries come incredibly fast, and are only made more impressive by the fact that the moves are real. The low effects budget left no money for wire-fighting techniques, so the actors trained with Indonesian Special Forces instead.If you are at all squeamish or under seventeen, stay away. If you are looking for highbrow fare with any kind of message or moral, keep looking. But if you want nonstop heart pounding action, this is your movie. I can hardly wait for the announced sequel, or the English language remake.",

This is Pencak Silat, a unique and brutal knife fighting technique developed in the island regions from which they hail. I must admit I had never heard of it before I saw this movie, and most of my martial arts film collection focuses mainly on Japanese and Chinese cinema with a few Thai films here or there, but this one blew me away.The story is about a SWAT team entering a small and dilapidated apartment complex run by one of Jakarta's most brutal drug lords. Every resident is a victim, dealer, or criminal, and every room is rented. They are here under the command of their Lieutenant, in a 20 person unit headed to the top floor to bring down the leader of this loose organization and bring him to justice, or so they think. You are introduced to Rama at the beginning, a man who trains hard, has a wife, a police officer and SWAT unit member with some experience. He has heart, and you get that right from the start, but there is something about him that he hasn't told anyone is his unit, and it's a secret he must keep. The leader of the unit is head strong and sure fire, but things don't go as planned and what follows is a non-stop battle of knives, guns and fists throughout.This movie is a absolute must for actions fans. Even if you don't like foreign cinema, this movie has a lot to teach Hollywood in terms of how you don't need a huge budget to create a fantastic film. Interestingly enough, the movie 'Dredd' (2012) with Karl Urban, came out about a year later. Some critics noticed the similarity in plot between the two films, with 'The Raid-Redemption'(2011) only coming out only a year before. The plot devices are so similar, that the movies could have been interchangeable if not for the characters, time-line, and budget. If you watch those films back to back (I did), you might be surprised at just how these two movies match up in terms of story, events, and theme. Both have cops raiding and apartment, both have drug lords ordering the residents to go after the cops, both films have their character's allegiances tested in similar ways, and both have a floor by floor filming style as they ascend their way to the top level.Although not known for it's movie production and cinematic influence (outside of a few notable documentaries), Indonesia has a lot to be proud of with this film. This one proudly stands right up there at the top. I would certainly love to see more of these actors and their unique style of fighting come out of their homeland. 7/10",

They soon become trapped and pursued by an army of criminals. I will not hesitate in saying that this is one of the most action packed movies I have ever seen! Within the first ten minutes, they are in the building and the carnage begins and does not stop until the end.The fight scenes are palpable and graphic; you can clearly see what is happening and everything is right in your face (I mean this in the best possible way). This is a breath of fresh air for action-fans such as myself because many action movies now a days use shaky and quick-cut camera-work so they do not actually have to show what is happening. Others use excessive amounts of CGI so everything seems fake. This movie on the other hand makes everything that happens easy to see; you actually see people punching, kicking, shooting, stabbing, slicing, and killing each other. Nothing is left to the imagination. The movie is also very suspenseful, especially in the first act when the SWAT team first gets ambushed and are running around doing everything they can to survive and save every last man. Everything from that point on is, as Rotten Tomatoes puts it, all thrills and no frills. The whole movie feels almost like a video-game, just action, fighting, shooting, survival, suspense, and lots and LOTS of action! The movie does a great job of being creative with the fight scenes and being as brutal and intense as possible. I found myself cringing and going \"OOOHH!! That's gotta hurt!\" at so many times throughout the movie. I suppose the main problem I have with The Raid: Redemption is the lack of character development. You know very little about any of the characters and it makes it extremely difficult to have any sympathy for them. For a movie as action-packed as this, it would not have killed anyone if they added 5-10 minutes of character development in the beginning. In conclusion, The Raid: Redemption is an amazing action movie with some of the best fight scenes ever put to film. If you are looking for interesting characters and a deeper meaning, you will not find it here, but you will find a great amount of entertainment much better then 90% of the action movies in recent years.",

It doesn't have any noteworthy plot or acting, but it is remarkable for its action and the tense and at-times unpredictable and creative scenes. I think The Raid is one of the best action films ever made.The choreography and cinematography of the fight scenes are amazing. Often, many action films have some errors/flaws or the fights seem fake but I didn't notice any major flaws with the scenes here. The director and the stunt coordinator, along with the actors, have done a very good job making everything seem so real.If you are into martial arts films, or if you have never seen a really good one, you should check out this film.You don't know what wall-to-wall action is until you see this film!",

            "content": "Tension. Tension. Shootout. Tension. Shootout. More Tension. Fight. Fight. Fight. Fight. This is The Raid in a nutshell. This film is a rock em' sock em' absolutely brutal beatdown of an action film that takes no prisoners, pulls no punches, and is not afraid of making you cringe. Plot be damned, because it's all about the video game-like action that sprinkles itself in the 90+ minutes of pure Indonesian mayhem.For those that still want to know what it's about, The Raid starts off with our male lead leaving his pregnant wife to do a mission. The mission is simple: raid a creepy abandoned building and arrest the guy responsible for running all the illegal nonsense. What follows are plot twists, plot turns, a few surprises, plenty of clich\u00e9s, and enough action to cover two summer seasons. Not kidding in the least bit, action junkies will get their fix and some with this flick.The Raid's biggest strengths can be contributed to the direction and cinematography. This film lacks lighting; it lacks a polished look, and avoids the wide shot like the dickens--giving it a very gritty feel. Close-ups are abundant when building tension, when the stakes are raised, and especially when the fights are delivered. Containing some of the best-directed martial arts since Jackie Chan himself, the fights are extremely well-choreographed, tightly edited, and are so intense that during my viewing, half the audience walked out. This is no PG-13 fight flick, you'll see nasty body blow after blow, and see more knives than a butcher, and more fatalities than every Mortal Kombat game combined. The death and dismembered count is nice and high.For the nitpicky, the plot is definitely clich\u00e9d and definitely predictable. For the nitpicky, the acting is honestly not the best, and neither is the writing. But nobody is walking into this movie to focus on any type of story. You are entering this movie with three things in mind: action, carnage, and martial arts.And you will have plenty of all three.And perhaps way more than you can handle.",

I think the only two other movies that have come out this year that have been more hyped up are \"The Hunger Games,\" and \"The Cabin in the Woods.\" I really had no idea what this film was about going into it, I basically read a one sentence sympnosis of it. So, was the movie as good as everyone is making it out to be? Kinda.OK, I will say that for the most part, I really enjoyed this movie. The acting is great, I of course saw this with subtitles, so I got the actual actors and not someone dubbing over it. The fight scenes are very, very well choreographed. That's the main fun of the movie is the fighting and the violence. There is a lot of violence in this movie, and there are sometimes where it got hard to watch. I cringed several times. The villains are great, I just clenched my fists, waiting for them to die. And the plot was, really well done, I had a little trouble trying to keep up at times.But that is also one of the movies main problems, there were times where I just went \"huh.\" That might not be a bad thing, but it hurt my enjoyment of the film. Also I wasn't a big fan of the characters, they aren't bad, but there are just too many of them and I really only gave a crap about two of them. And some characters do the stupidest things. There was a point when one of the villains has someone tied up. Aother good guy comes in, and he lets the other guy go so he can fight them both. And it's not like he has a weapon, he just decides to go 2 on 1.Other than that, I didn't have many problems with this film. It isn't too long, so it's worth seeing unless you aren't a fan of violent films.7.5/10",

Basically a derelict apartment building, fifteen stories high, in the heart of the slums, serves as a safe house for some of the most dangerous criminals in Jakarta, it is considered impregnable and untouchable by rivals of the crime lord Tama Riyadi (Ray Sahetapy) and even the police, but an elite SWAT team have been tasked with storming the block and taking the mobster down. Expectant father and rookie cop Rama (Iko Uwais) is part of the twenty man team raiding the building, with Sergeant Jaka (Joe Taslim) leading and Lieutenant Wahyu (Pierre Gruno) guiding them, and to get inside they have one of the local residents, who is returning with medicine for his sick wife, help them out, and other residents along the way are silenced and tied up to stop detection. It is when the team reach the sixth floor however that a young lookout spots them and raises the alarm to the criminals that the police are inside, before he is shot and killed, and Tama calls for reinforcements, while two snipers take the two officers outside on the ground floor trapping the team inside, and slowly of the SWAT team members are killed in the growing chaos. Tama shuts down the power inside the building so that they cannot go any further than the sixth floor, and he alerts all other residents and criminals inside that will be rewarded becoming permanent residents if they kill the intruders. Sergeant Jaka learns that the mission was not authorised by the department, so there is no one that knows they are raiding the building or that will be coming to help them, and eventually after lengthy battle and lots of gunfire only six members of the team remain. Sergeant Jaka, Lieutenant Wahyu, Bowo (Tegar Satrya), Dagu (It Eka 'Piranha' Rahmadia) and Rama have survived the ambush, but are low on ammunition and being hunted by the various criminals, there is a point when Rama and Bowo manage to get some help from the man with his sick wife hiding in a secret passage behind a wall, they are lucky to survive gang heavies searching for them. Rama gets kidnapped by Tama's right hand man Andi (Donny Alamsyah), while the group with Jaka are caught by Tama's ruthless henchman Mad Dog (Yayan Ruhian), Wahyu manages to escape, and Dagu is ordered to follow him. Mad Dog and Jaka go against each other, but they decide to drop their weapons and fight with their martial arts skills, Jaka is defeated and killed, while in Andi's apartment he reveals that Tama is his alienated brother, and he returns to Tama with Mad Dog dragging the body of Jaka, but the lead criminal saw Andi's betrayal with Rama on CCTV and stabs him in the hand. Tama is located on the fifteenth floor in a narcotics lab setting, and Rama, Wahyu and Dagu regroup to go and stop Mad Dog from beating up Andi, Rama and Andi kill Mad Dog, while Wahyu and Dagu go to get Tama. Eventually after the fighting and going up the stairs the police team members catch up to Tama, after Dagu was shot dead by Wahyu, but he goes against his original instinct and kills Tama with a shot in the head, but he cannot kill himself as well when he runs out of ammo, and in the end Rama, Bowo walk out of the apartment building with Andi and the captured Wahyu, but Andi returns to the building as the officers walk away. Also starring Verdi Solaiman as Budi, Ananda George as Ari and Iang Darmawan as Gofar. Most of the cast members make their characters memorable enough, especially the criminal mastermind protected by all his thugs inside the building, I will admit I did get a little confused with the plot towards the middle, but overall the story is enough to get, a raid in a building full of criminals armed to the teeth, obviously it is made the most exciting by the rapid gunfire, some small explosions, the martial arts fight sequences and the high violence content, it is indeed an exciting and inventive action crime thriller film.

The police force, specifically the higher ups are obviously in many ways corrupt, and the featured SWAT team are essentially lambs to the slaughter... Enter Rama (Iko Uwais). Iko and other cast members get to show off their mad Martial Arts skills, which sets this apart from many other standard action flicks. Most likely the Hollywood introduction of the Indonesian Martial Art 'Pencak Silat', which has become prevalent in modern action movies such as the 'John Wick' series, and most recently 'Extraction'.I found it somewhat amusing that when the SWAT team either lost their guns or ran out of ammo, conveniently the bad guys did too. From thereon they all resorted to only machetes or hand to hand. And man, these guys can take incredible non stop beatings, and still look pretty good afterwards.In any case, quality effects and stunts make this very entertaining for any action junkie.",

Iko Uwais, (Rama) a S.W.A.T. member of twenty men who are brought in to take down a brutal mobster king pin Tama (Ray Sahetapy). Through their routine of infiltration a young boy they stumble upon was the catalyst to starting the most intense fighting using weapons or guns at their disposal. Now both Rama and his partners must find a way out before becoming the next casualty. Yet in the hideout with Tama, is a rogue wolf brother of Rama's who becomes the next one hunted. Through the entire building each squad member must face an opponent, in small or large groups. I must confess, that although I do not like Mui Tai boxing, it does show a great deal of intricate moves which one could become dizzy with. It reminds me of Tony Jaa in Ong Bak. Fantastic fight scenes, between the brothers and Mad Dog (Yayan Ruhian). As for the story itself, it was slightly offbeat with the guess of who is in with the kingpin kind of thing. Most of the clues lead to their lieutenant who devised the raid in the first place. This told me it was the lieutenant in the first hour when Rama heard how no back up was coming to save them. However, moving around the building for the whole movie was a nice trick. You were never bored, action through out, but the characters needed to pick up a few more emotional sequences to make it more intense with the story. But -- to be fair, these days Indonesian films have become quite the trend now with new stories, new fights, and new ways to wow the crowd. Excellent acting from Iko Uwais. Much like Tony Jaa, they can fit any role.",

            "content": "One of the most incredible, exhilarating & heart-pounding action films to come out in a long time, The Raid (also known as The Raid: Redemption) is possibly the purest form of action extravaganza that has ever graced the film canvas which, apart from bringing a smile on every action film lover with its maddening depiction of blood, violence & insane fight sequences, also marks a significant breakthrough for the so-far-invisible Indonesian film industry to come into the attention of world cinema audience.Although by no means it is a perfect film, but when it comes to pure adrenaline rush, thrilling factor & entertainment value, action films don't get anymore exciting, inventive or satisfying than this high-octane, full-throttled & top-gear action spectacle. The plot concerns a raid operation taking place in a 15 storey apartment building which houses a ruthless crime lord and tells the story of a rookie officer amongst them. When their presence is known in the building, the cops are left with no choice but to do anything it takes to make out of the dreaded place in a single piece.To be honest, there isn't much to bother with the story of The Raid because it only serves as a reasonable justification to all the endless carnage that surrounds this film. Written, edited & directed by Gareth Evans, who surely knows what great action is all about, the film boasts some amazing fight sequences which are amazingly well captured. Cinematography presents a bleak picture that perfectly fits with the inhospitable look of the building while the entire story is explosively paced & tightly edited for maximum entertainment.Coming to the performances, there isn't anything to praise but the cast leaves nothing major to complain about too. Iko Uwais plays Rama; the rookie cop around whom the story revolves & does a neat enough job with his role. Yayan Ruhian impresses the most as Mad Dog & is a show- stealer in every single scene. Rest are good in their given roles too but it's Uwais & Ruhian who put up some of the most amazing action stunts ever filmed on camera. The soundtrack also contributes greatly in fuelling the intensity of the film with its adrenaline boosting tracks.Every cinema lover has few movies which they absolutely adore no matter how many noticeable flaws, loopholes or inconsistencies it may have for it's their unique cinematic experience which makes them exclusively special. The Raid fits into that category of films. It has a decent story & typical plot developments, but the sheer jaw-dropping experience it provides with its insane action is something that even many technically perfect films fail to emulate.On an overall scale, with its remarkable use of guns, machetes & martial arts during its fight sequences, The Raid takes action in cinema to a whole new level of awesomeness & amazement and is a violent ride of intense & insane action that guarantees a breathtaking experience for action film lovers. Therefore, in case you are one, then don't even dare to miss this action masterpiece because disappointment is certainly not an option here.",

            "content": "When I finished watching this movie... I was left speechless. Usually, I would probably dislike mindless action films... the only notable exceptions being Transformers and Ninja Assassin, both guilty pleasures in their own right.The Raid came off as the most insane movie I've ever seen. Gareth Evans really had the guts to pull it off: giving us a clich\u00e9d protagonist with a mediocre motivation and a weak, nonsensical plot, and instead, throws at us 99 solid minutes of mindless skull-bashing action and brain-numbing violence, inviting us to step into one adrenaline-maxed out scenario after another, the intensity of the fights escalating as the movie progresses, making all of the Hong Kong action films I grew up watching seem like child's play.The film does have its rare calm moments in between brawls, but they are all too short to make an impression. When it does cool down... you're biting your nails, wondering what vicious and imaginative way would the director execute another fight scene or kill more people off. And when it arrives, the sequences would leave any viewer attempting to catch their breath... but the film just leaves no room for that.Mindless action aside, the cinematography and editing were awesome, not what was I expecting from a movie that cost 1.1 million dollars to make, contributing to the intensity of the film. The gritty and dark photography cranks up the tension to the max, making it one of the best films that would get your heart racing by the second minute, a wondrous experience for action fanatics.Forget the solid acting, the unbelievable situations of the film (Where the hell in Jakarta can you find a flat populated entirely by ridiculously psychotic or mentally sick criminals who knows how to put up a good fight whenever confronted?), the terrible and recycled writing. Leave your brain at the doorstep and watch it, immense yourself. I highly recommend this to any action fan.",

            "content": "Just when the Asian martial-arts genre had lost one of its brightest young stars Tony Jaa to mysticism, along comes Indonesian actor Iko Uwais to give it a renewed kick of life- and boy let's just say that it is not simply a kick, but more accurately a lightning jolt. Fans of the genre shouldn't be all too surprised at the hype surrounding 'The Raid: Redemption', the second collaboration between Iko and Welsh-born director Gareth Evans- their first Merantau' already offered a peek at what the 31-year-old 'silat' practitioner was capable of.Learning from the lessons of their earlier film, Gareth has pared down the elements of plot, character, dialogue and perhaps most importantly culture specificity to deliver a quintessential action film that riffs on Hollywood classics like 'Die Hard' and 'Assault on Precinct 13'. So the premise is kept simple but yet efficient- an elite special forces team is ordered to raid a grimy tenement building that has long been the stronghold of a powerful drug kingpin Tama (Ray Sahetapy).Uwais' character Rama is one of the police officers sent into the suicide mission, introduced with a tersely told prologue that sees him kissing his pregnant wife goodbye and telling his father that he will 'bring home' his presumably lost brother. Gareth, who also wrote the screenplay, uses the former insofar as motivation for Rama to keep fighting and reserves the latter for a somewhat unexpected plot twist that gives the film more depth than you would expect.Otherwise, he keeps his focus on the setup for the action sequences which are unequivocally the purpose of the entire movie. Right from the start, we are left in anticipation for that climactic fight between Rama and Tama's two henchmen Andi (Doni Alamsyah) and Mad Dog (Yayan Ruhian), the latter of whom is described by the team leader (former Indonesian judo champion Joe Taslim) as 'a maniac of feet and fists that would tear down walls for his boss'. That doesn't mean however that Gareth, who co- choreographed the action with Yayan and Iko himself, takes it easy in the meantime.Rather, he unleashes all the bullets at his disposal within the first half-hour, as the team finds themselves up and against every lowlife tenant in the building, promised free rent by Tama if they can rid the building of its recent 'cockroach infestation'. What's worse, the building is rigged with cameras at every corner and on every floor which Tama views from the safety of his control room right up on the fifteenth storey- and suffice to say it isn't long before the whole team is whittled down to just Rama, his team leader and their corrupt boss Lt. Wahyu (Pierre Gruno).No matter really- simplicity is still ultimately the beauty of this no- holds-barred action movie so the faster we get to the good guys that matter the better. To up the ante, our heroes are clearly outnumbered as they are set upon floor by floor by thugs wielding knives, guns and machetes. Even though these earlier fights are just appetisers for the main showdown, it is evident that no lack of effort has been made to ensure that each is gripping to the bone.Amidst snapped necks, smashed skulls and slit throats, the singular thing that impresses is the thrilling efficiency by which Iko dispatches his opponents. There is nothing too elaborate that the killings appear contrived; rather, brutal as they may be, Iko keeps them realistic and most of all inventive, coming up with new ways each time round to ensure that the brawls are always never less than captivating. Kudos to Iko for both his choreography and execution, both of which combine to emphasise the artistic aspect in the martial-arts form on display.In contrast to Iko's Rama, there is something elementally frightening about Yahan's Mad Dog, who in an extended sequence sure to make the squeamish wince, uses his plain fisticuffs to beat one of the police officers to his death instead of ending it quickly with his pistol. \"This is what I do,\" he says, holding up his hands- so formidable is he that when Rama eventually takes him on, it becomes a two-against-one battle with the odds in the latter's favour.That finale, taking place inside the confines of an iron-walled room, is one of the most exhilarating and exhausting fight scenes ever captured on film, capped with a satisfyingly violent finish that had the audience at this reviewer's screening clapping their hands in glee. And the best part about it is that you get to see every move in the clarity it deserves, both lensers- Matt Flannery and Dimas Imam Subhono- constantly offering fresh new angles to the action and vehemently eschewing the kind of shaky-cam or quick editing Hollywood is too fond of employing nowadays.Complemented with a pulsating score by Joseph Trapanese and Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda, there is no doubt this exceptional film deserves all the positive buzz that has come its way since premiering to raves at the Toronto International Film Festival. It is relentlessly breathtaking every step of the way, building tension and excitement minute by minute until it unleashes its ultimate salvo guaranteed to leave you cheering. Under the assured hands of director Gareth Evans, who despite his young age has mastered a skillful grasp on the action genre, 'The Raid: Redemption' is also sure to be a star-making vehicle for Iko- and if you can't quite figure out why there is the word 'redemption' in its title, then take it simply for the fact that it has brought due recognition to the dazzling partnership between Iko and Gareth after the under- appreciated 'Merantau'.www.moviexclusive.com",

That being said they have actually managed to get a bit of a story thrown in, a relatively solid story at that.The premise is that a SWAT team, mostly full of rookies, is sent in to an apartment building to extract a crime lord. They have to deal with the fact that most of the tenants of the building are criminals, there are lookouts on every floor and a video surveillance system. It also becomes clear rather quickly that the lieutenant leading the assault isn't on the up and up.The first portion of the movie starts with the SWAT team doing what they do best. Methodically and quietly clearing the building as they move ever upward. Then things fall apart and they are in an extended gun battle.The action in the movie isn't limited to gun fights. There is a scene that reminded me of the hallway scene in Old Boy, but with knives, tonfa (police baton) and one cop marching through dozens of bad guys. There is also time for a couple of brutal hand-to-hand fights.The plot I alluded to earlier is hard to outline without spoiling the movie. It is clear that ulterior motives abound, most obviously in the lieutenant who arranges the raid. But as the movie unfolds, it becomes clear that there is more going on.

            "content": "The plot of the 2011 movie The Raid: Redemption is in a way, similar to the 2012 movie Dredd. In both cases, police officers are trapped in a residential high rise, having to battle through waves of cold blooded criminals who are eager to end the heroes' lives. But that is where the similarity ends. In The Raid, the criminals come in swarms. The actors are also quite adept at martial arts, so the jarring 1 second and half second cuts of action seen in some other action movies aren't used here. The fight coordinator also gets a chance to prove their talent, making the fights seem both overwhelming but also believable. Bad guys lining up one by one is not a trope used here.At the same time though, this is also a police drama. While all scenes take place within and outside of this one building after the first minutes, the movie introduces conflicts and questions about potential alliances and corruption coming from the department itself.Although I've seen the movie several times now in its original Taiwanese, I did watch a few minutes of a few scenes with the English dubbing, and it seemed to be well done also. The voice actors seemed like a good fit for the characters they were playing, and both the dialog and the timing seemed rather close to the English translation. I lack the ability to follow French, so the level of that audio track isn't something that I can judge.The only detail which fans of this type of movie might object to though, is the violence. While it is by no means gratuitous, and you don't see any of the excessive measures that some filmmakers sometimes go for, there are a few scenes which would be clearly cut if the movie were ever shown on network TV. One example would be one of the many people trying to kill a police officer, getting thrown out a window, and falling a few stories so that a railing bends their back unnaturally far backwards. The editing is rather clever so that you see this person from their attack straight through to their fall and their literal back-breaking landing. There are only a handful of scenes like this which would go beyond network prime time programming, but if such scenes would kill your day, you might want to avoid this movie. But again, what it shows isn't beyond what one might see under such circumstances, nor is it the point of the movie.In short, this is a good film for anybody who likes a great martial arts movie or a good police story. Although the main actors aren't quite as talented as Bruce Lee in his technique or as Jackie Chan in his death defying stunt work, the level of skill is beyond what you'd see from most of the main characters of a Marvel or DC movie. In short, this movie is worthy of Sony's \"Classics\" label.",

            "content": "In \"The Raid: Redemption\" the awesome fight scene has brothers Rama (Iko Uwais) and Andi (Donny Alamsyah) trading punches, kicks, and locks with Mad Dog (badass Yayan Ruhian). The fight literally lasts 10 minutes. Rama and Andi are attacking Mad Dog simultaneously\u2014none of this one at a time stuff. Director and writer Gareth Evans also shoots full body action sequences-- no quick cut edits of torso moves. Uwais is a master of Silat, Indonesian martial art, and really kicks some ass up to this point. But Mad Dog is unstoppable\u2014a master perhaps jacked up on meth. The fight scene is insane, one of the best in movies ever. \"The Raid\" is awesome. As my bud Robert, a film director, pointed out that the production values are weak, and the narrative is thin. However, he also said that you see \"The Raid\" for the amazing martial arts.Set in Jakarta, Uwais plays Rama, who is a SWAT member and expectant father. Uwais is good-looking, charismatic, and deathly calm. His SWAT team raids the tower safe house of drug lord Tama (over the top evil Ray Sahetapy), lead by Lt. Jaka (earnest Joe Taslim). Tama commands from the top floor of the tower, and has his henchmen wreak havoc on those below. Rama has another more personal mission: He must rescue the soul of his prodigal brother Andi (strong and smart Donny Alamsyah). The story has been done before\u2014reminiscent of Bruce Lee's \"Game of Death\". Once the automatic weapons play out, the movie goes wild\u2014in a good way. The sword fighting is also amazing.I was not familiar with the Indonesian martial art Silat. Silat is like Muay Thai, close in elbows and knees. Silat also uses kung fu round kicks and blows. Uwais and Ruhian throw nice boxing hooks. There are also cool locks, chokes, and throws. Silat is beautiful and brutal.See \"The Raid\" for the electrifying martial arts action. The acting is solid and the story is derivative. The showcase fight scene with the brothers taking on Mad Dog is spectacular. I wonder how many times Evans had to film the scene. It was definitely worth it.",

It's like your'e expecting a ride in a Boeing airline, from a Lamborghini.What kind of ride this film was, people will get shot in the head at point blank, people get stabbed not only once but multiple times, people get thrown of a balcony only to be a landing mat, etc. etc in ways you never have imagine before.So please, don't bring your kids to this movie, or your spouses who happens to enjoy Jennifer Aniston's movie.

Everybody that played GoldenEye 007 on N64 is well-aware of proximity mines, smoke grenades and the like.On the contrary, The Raid is fantastic.The fellow who owns the criminal complex being raid redeemed has an interrogation room with a chain restraining system. It's a chamber specifically suited towards information extraction via shackled prisoners.Speaking without hyperbole, Raid: Red contains the single greatest action sequence in cinematic history.Gareth Evans deserves a standing ovation for the fire axe scene.The tension is multi-layered as the characters realistically adapt to an evolving conflict. There are varied threats and the individual movement through the scenery (plus the interplay with props/weaponry) is magnificent.It's a delicate waltz, my Friends.A riveting score overlays elaborate choreography, creative stunts and sharp camera-work.The Raid is originally an Indonesian film and Sony Pictures tasked Mike Shinoda (of Linkin Park and Fort Minor) with creating a new score for the U.S. market. The Shinoda scored version made its U.S. debut at Sundance 2012.The fire axe is just one of many great scenes though. Rent it and see for yourself.The stakes are high. The plot is smart and dark.Neither slasher nor 'torture porn.'It's as good as action gets.Somebody at the festival must have noticed the issue with the subtitles, right?Whoever translated the closed captioning did very poor work. One of the main barriers between non-viewers is the necessary reading, so naturally a minimalist approach would seem appropriate.There were subtitles for grunts, music notes to indicate the swell of Shinoda's composition (which goes against the very nature of a film score), footsteps and other sound effects. This would make sense if America were a deaf culture.One subtitle in particular, \"Okay (English),\" appears toward the middle of the film. This is more than a distraction. It's especially problematic because it instigates needless confusion.Why the distributors haven't fixed the closed captions (especially now the sequel's been released) is beyond me.But behold; I let it go. You will too.If you're a lady who loved The Raid, please set me straight; your comments are welcome!Gentlemen \u2013 go nuts.",

            "content": "After hearing so much about The Raid, I knew I had to see it. I am a sucker for foreign action flicks, particularly Asian action, and The Raid is one of the best I've seen in a long, long time. My usual complaints about action films generally stem from a lack of action to satisfy and a lack of diversity in the action presented. Not here. The Raid is so filled with action and is creative enough with it, that any action buff will be satisfied with what is presented.The Raid is simple enough: a special forces team is sent into a derelict apartment housing filled with criminal dwellers. However, the mission goes wrong and it's a fight for survival as the remaining team fights through the floors to reach the top and take out their main target. There is little downtime in this film. With a few expositionary scenes, the majority of the film is dedicated to ass kicking. And ass kicking it does plenty of. Everything an action junkie could want is here. From gun fights to one on one combat to two on one combat, there is no shortage of adrenaline here. And the action is all brutal, with no wire-fu or special effects seen here. It's all bone-crunching, throat slicing, body beating realism.Thankfully the fights are not only varied, with few of them seeming repetitive or boring, and they are all shown with great precision. There is very little incoherence here or shaky cam, one of the many faults that seem to plague modern action films. The Raid is presented with great skill. It's in part due to the presentation and skill in filmmaking that this is such an accomplished action film. This includes the acting, which is adequate for the film. Our main hero, Rama, played by the very competent Iko Uwais, comes across as an every man, similar to Tony Jaa or Jackie Chan. We see that he is more a skilled man simply trying to stay alive than a super soldier or one man army. This increases the tension in many scenes, as we genuinely feel that these characters, each of the good guys, are in real danger. And there are enough tension filled scenes to put you on the edge of your seat.With bone crunching, brutal, and bloody combat, The Raid is the best action film in years. It's a damn shame this isn't in more theaters, because it really does deserve to be seen by anyone who likes action films. It's many awesome moments will have you salivating for more, and by the time the film is over, you'll be hungry for more.",

            "content": "Double bill time, Welsh filmmaker Gareth Evans has made a big splash with his action one-two punch which puts the Indonesian martial art \"Pencak Silat\" on a bigger map. Swimming against the tide of an inexorably digitized world, since the noughties, action movies have been experiencing a somewhat fundamentalistic revolution ushered in by ONG-BAK: THE THAI WARRIOR (2003), where a more tactile, point-blank and lethal combat style greatly relying on the performers' physical prowess sounding the death knell for a plethora of CGI-heavy schlock, and Gareth Evans takes the revolution further down that road, at any time of the day, it is more than welcomingBlanketed in its slate blue hue, THE RAID: REDEMPTION has a setting like a single-location entrapment horror flick, a catastrophic heavy blow incurs to a team of elite squad when they raid inside a tenement tower block owned by the crime lord Tama Riyado (Sahetapy) in Jakarta's slums, it turns out to be a set-up as a corollary of corruption among police top-brass. Assailed by not zombies but practically zombie-looking inhabitants (bedraggled drug addicts mostly) and a cohort of Tama's henchmen, they might find some painful irony (if they are still breathing) from recollecting the paradoxical pep talk of Sergeant Jaka (Taslim), who is leading the raid, paraphrasing here: it is a highly dangerous mission, but I don't want to see any of those seats empty when we return. The one who is bestowed with a protagonist nimbus is Rama (Uwais), a tyro in the forces and has an ax to grind in the game, when all the ammo is expended, his killer martial art skill starts to tip the scale in the bloodshed. Since its no-account story-line seldom fluctuates with plot development (barring a fraternal reunion), and although many tropes of suspense routinely deployed to the hilt, it is the action pieces taking our breath away, the go-for-the-jugular (joints, limbs, and other more cardinal parts) pragmatism and Evans' lenience on blood and guts, skewered together one set piece after another, our rapt attention becomes a given, and the brutal aesthetics reaches its crescendo in the close-range combat between Rama, his brother Andi (Alamsyah) and Tama's top muscle, a disheveled Mad Dog (Ruhian, who is a martial art virtuoso and the fight choreographer for both movies, also plays a completely different character in the sequel). After REDEMPTION successfully testing the water, THE RAID 2: BERANDAL (which means thug in Indonesian) is expectedly souped up by a significantly boosted budget and an ampler length (150 minutes, 50 minutes longer than the first installment). Mapping out an ambitious gangster turf war saga, Evans' script swiftly sends Rama to the joint to befriend Uco (Putra), the son of Bangun (Pakusadewo), one of the two kingpins of Jakarta's underworld, where a muddy m\u00eal\u00e8e during a downpour set alight the first frisson of excitement (it is a virtue Evans doesn't overuse the worn- out slo-mo shtick, after THE MATRIX 1999 and its countless emulators, enough is enough). In fact, the resultant story veers more towards Uco's ill-conceived subversion, and Putra, not quite a martial artist himself but commendably takes up the gauntlet as a pompous gilded youth, too thrusting and wanting both wits and patience to mellow into a rightful heir of his father's cosmic empire, particularly when there is nothing to imperil his standing, what is the fuss anyway? Maybe like in every patriarch's incubus, he is just a bad seed and driven at lengths to carry out a patricidal sin, Putra's performance is vehement, visceral and transforms Uco as the film's heart of matter, a grab bag of what is wrong with today's youngsters. In the action section, on the one hand, Evans continues choreographing striking fighting sequences of Pencak Silat, and playing up the possibility of orchestration within a two-by-four space (a prison bathroom, or inside a barreling car); on the other hand, in tandem with an enclosed fistfight, he also cuts his teeth into a sterling car chase set piece with an ace in his sleeve, and what an adrenaline rush it spurs! Although it would be remiss of me to not mention a congenital hiccup rather common in action fares, those conspicuous ready-to-take-the-hit poses or caesuras, mostly from foot soldiers during their meager screen-time, it immediately dispels the \"realness\" of all the onerously rehearsed teamwork. The most pyrotechnic eye-catcher is indubitably the final showdown between Rama and the karambit-knives-wielding killer, credited as the Assassin (Rahman), which makes Very Tri Yulisman's Baseball Bat Man and Julie Estelle's Hammer Girl quite bathetic in their gore-fest, not to mention the boss who prefers heavy weaponry but is inept enough to toss it to the wrong one when the crunch comes.Both movies are cracking genre pieces made with labor of love, devotion and dexterity, and Evans' directorial flair takes a crucial peg up under the sequel's grander scale, blissfully, one can see the potential in a filmmaker which can unbridle the genre parameters.",

Expecting a routine bust, they under-estimate how ruthless the criminal is prepared to be and how much of an effective army he has at hand, and find themselves trapped in a massive concrete jungle, where martial arts killers lurk at every corner and only one side will take more casualties. One cop (Ido Kuwais) must race against time to save the day.With the advent of CGI and wire fu, the novelty of genuine martial artists, such as Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van Damme, performing their on screen daring do in Hollywood has lost it's edge, with us now living in a day and age where anyone can be a martial artist. So thank Heavens we can still turn to Asian cinema, which still makes a big deal out of showcasing the real deal. While stars from the past, such as Jackie Chan and Jet Li, seem to have left more of a legacy behind them than more recent discoveries such as Ong-bak's Tony Jaa, there is a new hope in the shape of Ido Kuwais, the lead star of this new raved about action piece, and his exponing of the fighting art of Silat, which this film shows in it's fastest, most breath taking and thrilling style.Director Gareth Evans, whose previous two features appear to be even more unknown and off the beaten track than this one, generates a genuine air of suspense and claustrophobia as events unfold, with the viewer really feeling locked in with the cops as they learn just how fu*ked they are and how everyone isn't telling the truth. The fight choreography is extremely impressive, displaying a real skill for the art while not forgetting to make it as fast, brutal and thrilling as it can be. Kuwais doesn't especially stand out as an action hero, but portraying a fairly generic Asian action star performs his duties with aplomb. In general, the script, acting and dialogue aren't first rate, but the film delivers where it was supposed to, and that's what matters.God knows the lazy cookie cutting machine that is Hollywood is re0making enough things at the moment- I'm sure their placid interpretation of this will soon be in our eyes. ****",

Starting with Uwais's choreography and fighting skills through the amazing skills shown by the rest of the cast, the film is constantly exciting and moves quickly from one foe to another and one fight to the next. What is really strong about the fights is the progression of the violence in the film. Upon entering the complex, the SWAT team and enemies fire at each other with automatic machine guns and powerful long distance weapons. These fights are not hand to hand, but a distant battle that is equally as exhilarating.To read the rest of the review (IMDb form is too small) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/the-raid-redemption/",

            "content": "Who'd have thought that Indonisia would raise the bar when it came to action movies? 'The Raid' is hardly the most complicated film to review, but, if you're into your gunplay and marshal-arts then you can't go far wrong here. Oh, and you'll need to be okay with subtitles.Basically, the film is about a police raid on a towerblock containing some of the toughest (and deadly) criminals around. And \u2013 guess what \u2013 things don't go too well for our boys in blue. It isn't long before their bodies start piling up, leaving only our plucky new recruit (who just so happens to be damn good at kicking people) to survive and untangle the mess that's quickly building up.If you're wondering what makes this so much better than all the other action movies out there \u2013 it's the 'look' (well, for starters anyway). It has a very professional and gritty feel to it. The director (who, to my shame, I've never heard of) has obviously spent a lot of time framing each shot to give it quite a nice \u2013 almost 'arty' \u2013 feel. Then there are the fight scenes \u2013 they're meticulously choreographed and, despite being technically as unrealistic as the next marshal arts film, they are really good fun to watch.The actors are basically cast according to their looks. Bad people are ugly and good people have nice hair. However, at least everyone plays their part well and, even though all the talking is subtitled, it seems that everyone can actually act as well as is required for beating people to a pulp.There are a few twists and turns in the plot \u2013 some you may see coming, others are less obvious. But I won't go into them too much. All you need to know is that, if you're okay with subtitles and love marshal arts or action films, then you'll enjoy The Raid (and its sequel, if you're curious about that!).",

            "content": "NOTE: Certain elements of this review may be an inaccurate reflection of the content of the film due to the fact that I was asleep during large parts of it. Unusually for me I will start by summarising the plot. I've ticked the spoiler box even though I don't think it's possible to spoil this film for anyone. We're in Indonesia (I know that from reading other reviews). A bunch of 20 policemen lay siege to a building for reasons unknown and alternately wander around looking anxious or getting into fights. Just over 100 of these 20 men are killed in the first battle. Some of the people you think are on one side are actually on the other side but you won't care by the time you work this out. It might be worth mentioning the cop who is supposed to be the hero has a pregnant wife (that's the entire emotional setup of the film BTW). At one point he discovers one of the bad guys is either his brother or his long lost gay lover, I forget which. I am, not for the first time, mystified. This film is getting rave reviews all over the place, even in the so-called quality press. I have no idea why. Supposedly it's non-stop action all the way. In fact it's boring wondering about scene, fight, stop, wonder around a bit more, fight, repeat. The action is constantly interrupted and the film never gathers momentum. I think most of my sleeping took place in the first twenty minutes of the film whilst I was waiting for something to happen. The thing that might interest you as a fan of martial arts films is the occasional (and I mean occasional) time we get to see a form of Indonesian martial art that is largely unknown in the West before this film. It is indeed potentially exciting and would probably work well in a film with a plot. As it is, the scenes in this film are rather like the scenes from a British TV programme \"The Fast Show\" where two men fight each other endlessly in dockland, they never give up and they get up every time and we never know why they are fighting. The fight scenes here are additionally spoiled by a) shaky cam and b) characters often stop to exchange guns for fists to give the opponent a fighting chance or wait patiently in the wings for their turn. In one scene one fighter spends several minutes strangling another he's already beaten to a pulp whilst a third guy gets it together to stop him. Nobody expects realism in martial arts but this is ridiculous. Like Peter Bradshaw in the Guardian I will quote Bruce Lee from Enter the Dragon: \"We need emotional content..\" You won't get it in this deeply boring and repetitive film though I can recommend it if you suffer from insomnia. And just so you know, I am a massive fan of martial arts films and I could name at least a hundred better examples than this dreck off the top of my head. PS I'm never comfortable being this rude about a film that people have sweated over but given the adoration it's getting elsewhere, I feel justified in giving the other side of the story. PPS Women fighters don't exist in Indonesia, apparently, even though they are a staple of martial arts films from countries with a real tradition of making such films.",

And the dubbing isn't why the dialogue is bad, but the dubbing itself isn't good either. But other than that I got to say that this is one of the craziest martial arts action films I have seen, possibly ever. Outstanding fight choreography from beginning to end. There's a good deal of gun play and slicing and dicing in here but the hand-to-hand fighting is where this stands out for me. There are a few scenes where there isn't any chaos going on but those scenes don't make me feel as if the movie is being slowed down. IMDB says it's 101 minutes, and that seems about right. It's not overly long. And while I was expecting a twist, it ended up being from a character that I didn't expect it from. Another one didn't exactly surprise me too much, even though I didn't predict it. I only say that because as far as plots go in movies like this, this one is kind of basic apart from the setting that the movie takes place in. I gotta see the sequel, because I hear that one is even better. This was insane.",

The story, such as it is, involves an elite SWAT team in over their heads fighting through an apartment complex full of gang members with only their elite martial arts and an ever-changing mix of weapons to help them.That undersells the movie somewhat, as the style is very carefully developed, and making great action takes a hell of a lot of work. And if there's one thing you can count on The Raid for, it's great action, with the highlight of it all being an extended three-way fight scene that's simply a joy to behold. Watching The Raid, you go through stages: amazed at the action; then overwhelmed, disgusted, and vaguely bloated from the carnage; then back to enjoying the violence again.To be honest, I probably couldn't describe much of this movie's plot to you. The attempts at plot twists are kind of hard to understand, and don't really add up to much. But as a sheer visceral experience, The Raid excels.",

Every other sequence culminates into an action scene & the crescendo is different for each. That makes the movie very unpredictable.

Implications are high & that is one negative for this action classic. It successfully hooks you into the plot without boring you. Certain parameters (call them add-ons) which are faintly related to emotions add to the glory of movie- watching. The dubbing made me upset, but its okay!BOTTOM LINE: Very good action flick without cheap tactics.MESSAGE: If you help someone, they will help you back... sometime!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

            "content": "At last, we have it: The first ten star film of the year. I was worried it might never happen. Then came The Raid.I'm not a fan of kung fu-type films and, whilst I admire Jackie Chan and appreciate he's incredibly skillful at what he does (i.e. not the acting!) his work leaves me cold. I'm not a fan of the protracted fights and the overriding feeling of watching a pantomime fight scene. And so I'd probably have ignored The Raid had it not been for an article I stumbled upon some months ago about a Welshman making an Indonesian film with a non-actor. The journalist thought, from the scenes he'd watched shooting, that it just might rock. Big time.It does. And more than that! I was quite literally stunned, jaw almost on the floor at times, and I will heartily recommend to all who care to listen. However, please note two points: 1. It is subtitled and, inexplicably, that appears to be a huge obstacle for some people (plebs! \u263a) and 2. It is extremely violent. If those are issues, don't bother reading on and cross it off your list immediately.The Raid is a beautiful, nay, exquisite, bloody ballet. The choreography is mind-blowing in its intricacy and balance and the physical performances are mesmerizing. Blood spurts, bones snap, skulls implode, furniture explodes, gunfire hammers through walls, wood and flesh and the language, such as it is, has the deepest hue of blue. Be warned, it isn't an easy ride but the journey is a pleasure that must be repeated. A sequel is planned but why wait around when the original is begging to be watched again? The premise is simple: A decrepit tower block has become a haven for a crime lord, his violent minions, those who can ill-afford more desirable neighbourhoods and any number of petty thugs who chose safety within rather than without. A police chief launches a raid on the block with a team of raw(ish) recruits with the task of killing the kingpin and avoiding their own demise. Needless to say, all does not go according to plan. However, one of the cops, Rama (Iko Uwais) has no intention of dying and his own agenda to follow.The story goes that Welsh director Gareth Evans discovered martial arts champion Uwais while shooting a documentary in Indonesia and persuaded him to quit his job as a driver to star in a film written around his talent, namely The Raid. When you watch The Raid (there's no if about it, go and see it!) you'll understand why Evans went to such efforts. Understand before you go into the cinema that they shot in real time. There are no special effects to speed up the fighting. It's a blur because Uwais and his co-stars are that fast! It's almost a relief that it runs at only 101 minutes because I don't think my eyes could take much more.There are no complexities with the plot, dialogue is light and the subtitles do not in anyway hinder the viewing (for those plebs who ignored me and are still reading). It's a fast, loud, blistering assault on the senses where the music, whilst perfectly selected, plays second fiddle to the soundtrack of grunts, crashes and explosions. The foley artists earned their money on this one! I'm not going to wax lyrical about the editing, the cinematography, the casting, the physical effects, the set If I haven't persuaded you that The Raid is a 'must see' by now, nothing else I write will do so. And if I have, you'll find out for yourselves. One thing I will highlight is the end credit sequence. As a credits geek (it's a big no-no to talk through them or leave before they end and for me to do so is a protest at how awful a film is) they were a joy to read. There are no 'extras', no gimmicks or effects, just a list of character names and numbers the like of which I've never seen before.There are some who will condemn The Raid for it's content, subject matter and ability to delight with such extreme displays of armed and unarmed combat. If any of them are still reading, I'll leave you with a pr\u00e9cis of a conversation I had as I left the cinema.As the lights went up, Marieke drew my attention to two ladies, two septuagenarian ladies, who had watched through to the bitter end. I raced after the couple to engage them in conversation and, as I reached them, they were nonchalantly discussing chopping up food in order to make it easier to swallow.\"Excuse me. I'm sorry to disturb you but, without wising to be rude, you're not the demographic one would expect to see in The Raid and I wondered, um, what are you doing here?\" They smiled and took great pleasure in informing me, in broad Bristolian accents, that they'd read a glowing review in The Guardian and that The Watershed was screening it. \"If The Watershed is showing it, it must be good. It's just much cheaper here.\" We discussed the film for perhaps ten minutes and it was clear that they saw beyond the violence and the language and saw the extreme beauty of the craftsmanship that went into every aspect of The Raid. For them it was the most challenging film they'd seen so far this year and one of the most rewarding.And if I didn't respect them enough for their opinions of the film and their enjoyment of TV delights The Killing, Borgen and Spiral, they certainly rocketed in my estimation with the last word I shall give them here: \"We had a lot more fun tonight than we did last week in that awful film, what was it, oh yes, The Lucky One.\"Another film review from The Squiss.Like the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",

Pierre Gruno is well cast as the world-weary lieutenant in question who gradually comes to doubt his decision to go rogue with his team. He has some excellent moments towards the end as he has to contend with the verbal torments of the drug lord. There is also a young SWAT member who we soon find out has some personal baggage with the mission. For the most part though, the film is one unrelenting action scene after another and the endlessness has an unwelcome mind-numbing effect. Magnificently choreographed as all the action sequences are, they are not quite as powerful without quiet moments in between to space them out; the carnage also loses its squirm value with so much grisliness constantly filling up the screen. It seems quite telling that the film's best scene is one without a single fight as two SWAT members hide out in a hollow wall with the drug lord's minions within inches of spotting them. It is a sequence full of suspense, whereas the majority of the film works on account of simpler thrills and chills. If taken as a pure visceral experience though, the film is admittedly very well done. The set design, full of eerily dilapidated hallways and many dark crevasses is simply spectacular, and the at times pulsating music score is pitch perfect throughout, providing an air of unease to every single scene.",

            "content": "There is no genre mixing in The Raid: Redemption. Unlike films which are billed as both comedy and drama or mystery and suspense thriller, The Raid is strictly action and that's it. There are different types of action such as martial arts, assault rifles, and knives, but that is as varied as the genre becomes. If you have the desire to see pure action and violence with hardly any intervening scenes to slow it down and provide plot, then The Raid is probably what you've been looking for.On a very early morning in Indonesia, an elite police squad is on its way to clear out a drug and gang infested building, floor by floor. The sergeant leading the operation, Jaka (Joe Taslim), does not lie to his troops about what awaits them. The building is controlled by Tama (Ray Sahetapy) and his two trusted lieutenants, Mad Dog (Yayan Ruhian) and Andi (Doni Alamsyah). I leave it up to you to guess which of these guys is the muscle and which is the brains. They hold court on the 15th floor of the building which is used as a narcotics operation and as a boarding house for every violent thug imaginable.The rookie on the team is Rama (Iko Uwais) who, of course, has a very pregnant wife at home. Along with 20 other police officers, they are to sweep the building, arrest the bad guys, and bring in Tama and his two cohorts. Things obviously do not follow the plan; otherwise The Raid would not be rapidly gaining in cult status as it is. In a twist, Tama, who quickly figures out what is going on in the lower floors of his buildings, makes an announcement to the hundreds of bad guys that whoever helps kill the cops, will get to live in the building forever rent free.Out come the pistols, machetes, knives, and every other item imaginable as the building's residents suddenly surround the cops and shut down the exits. Wave upon wave of hopped up gangster reigns assault rifle and machete-wielding fury upon the quickly diminishing and out-gunned crime fighters. Rama emerges as a very capable man not only with a knife, but with his bare hands. The close-quartered fight scenes are not short nor are they quickly edited and jumpy. There are extended sequences of men just annihilating one another all over the room employing some extremely impressive martial arts.Do not go into this film looking for plot and character development. You will not find it because there is no room for it in between all of the mayhem and bodies being flung all over the place. Normally, I would shrug off a film which is so one-sided; however, The Raid is so accomplished in what it is offering to the audience that I applaud it. These fight scenes are so well done they must have taken forever to choreograph and film. Sure, the script is ludicrous but the goal of the filmmaker is not to tell a story, but to impress its intended audience with a level of screen violence and authenticity it probably has not seen before.The Raid: Redemption is not for everyone; there are audience members (namely females and anyone who does not enjoy flowing blood) who will be repulsed by it and I urge them to stay away. The majority of the audience I saw this film with was male and solo. However, there were enough audible \"Ouch!\" and \"Damn!\" exclamations in the theatre that you might as well have been seeing it with your best guy friends.",

            "content": "While I've ragged on video game violence in the past, I have to admit that I liked THE RAID: REDEMPTION. The non-stop, full-speed-ahead action makes for fun viewing- but, like casual sex with a stranger, it lacks a lasting impact. Why do I say this? Because I just recently saw it for the SECOND time and didn't realize until I was well into it that I'd ALREADY seen it. (This sometimes happens with martial arts movies, especially when they've been re-titled, but this one wasn't retitled.) Being a boxing and mixed martial arts fan (not to mention a martial arts movie fan), I can appreciate action (violence) for its own sake. (Just recently, for instance, I saw the Georges St. Pierre-Johnny Hendricks title fight and I was genuinely surprised: judging from the comments by the so-called \"experts,\" the fight had been a one-sided affair handily won by Hendricks. Not so. St. Pierre won four out of five rounds, at the very least. Sometimes, you just have to see it for yourself...) There's enough action in THE RAID: REDEMPTION to give the viewer a concussion. It's sometimes a cross between a martial arts movie and a professional wrestling match (a LOT of contact appears to have been made along the way and, although the intention of the players obviously wasn't intentional harm to one another, they often pushed the envelope- hard). If there's a drawback to it all, it's the total lack of story (the failing of all too many action movies these days); in that respect, it IS not unlike a video game.",

The \"owner\" of the house tries to hamper this situation by force of arms and plenty habitants. The movie has no deepness, no details and endless fight scenes. Well endless fight scenes are generally not bad, but in the \"Raid\" the fights are turining into unrealistic and tedious moments. I can't propose to watch this movie it takes just life time.",

Even the entire dialogue itself is so boring and unexciting that they may as well have made it an all out action and not even bother with telling a story that in the end didn't even make sense. All the time it's basically, rinse and repeat. There were some cool set ups (liked especially when the kids pass on the \"police\" message) and some decent choreography but all of it really is ruined by constant shaky cam.

The swat team attempts their invasion of the building but are caught in a dangerous situation when their cover is blown. They are now trapped within the building and are lead by Lieutenant Wahyu in a deadly and action packed fight to survive. There is no backup coming to save them. There is no escape as the swat team would be killed if caught outside without cover. Their only option is to fight their way through Tama's men and kill the drug lord. I really enjoyed watching this film. One of my favorite scenes in the movie was when Rama and Dagu create a makeshift bomb to survive one of the many battles. This to me showed the extensive military training these men had. Another part that I enjoyed was when Mad Dog challenged Jaka to a fair fight with hand to hand combat. This was really cool as I love the hand to hand combat fight scenes and the choreography that it requires to make it look realistic. I really enjoyed the ending as it seemed relatively happy which, although I was always hoping for, I wasn't sure it would actually happen because it is not always guaranteed in foreign films which is exciting.",

            "content": "The Raid is an Indonesian movie that had gained vast popularity since its debut at 2011 Toronto Festival. Yet I and fellow Indonesians must wait until January 2012 for its national theatrical release. Thanks to our local action, horror, and fantasy film festival (INAFFF 2011) who bring The Raid as its closing movie so hundreds lucky Jakarta movie fans can watch this movie two month ahead its official release.The story is as simple as its title. I knew some spoilers from some Toronto reviewers. So I attended the show for its martial arts and original score.The version we saw was the international version, in Indonesian language with English subtitles, and original score by two Indonesian music illustrators. I was worried I would see the Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda score version because i read its original score was great and suitable the movie's atmosphere and indeed, Aria Prayogi and Fajar Yuskemal did a great job! Now, the martial arts section... You will find many fight scenes that looks real and bloody, but if you're not new to martial arts movies genre you'll think they're great or spectacular because of its close, fast, realistic and unpredictable moves by both protagonist or antagonist side that makes viewers had some wow moments and gave applause to some fight scenes... Thanks to the superb action choreography by the two leading actors Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhian.There's no bombastic sling fights or overlong fights with the winner stay clean. The Director of Photography did a great job too, showing us not-so-shaky fight scenes. As an Indonesian i've never seen our original martial arts style (Pencak Silat) could be as deadly as i'd seen in this movie; i only know Silat for solely exhibition or championship purpose.I'd like to compare The Raid to some of my favorite of Hongkong 90's modern martial arts movies such as Donnie Yen's In The Line of Duty 4 or Tiger Cage 2, or Frankie Chan's Burning Ambition and still i think The Raid is above them. Writer/editor/director Gareth Huy Evans create an efficient story with clever ending. It also had some funny dialogs for us -the native viewers- though its English subtitles (a little bit) didn't match the original. But still The Raid is a great martial arts movie, not only compare to Indonesian or South Asia action movies but in general...Since The Raid got Sony and other international distributors' attention for its international release then there will be many martial arts movie fans worldwide are gonna watch this movie and i bet they'll like it too...",

They were filmed back to back but I wouldn't be surprised if the makers of Dredd weren't influenced by this film.Plot-wise the film is rather simplistic. A mob boss is holding down to a single location, the police special forces have to fight their way to him. Of course it's not quite that simple, but you get the gist of it.Where this film shines is in execution of its fight scenes. They squeeze every possible drop of entertainment out of this location and their stars, many of whom are accomplished practitioners of Pencak Silat, the Indonesian martial art.There are those that'll complain that this film is nothing more than one fight action scene after another. And to those people I say, this is not your film. This is a film for martial arts aficionados, who can appreciate a perfectly crafted fight scene, almost completely devout of shaky cam or jarring jump cuts. This film and its fight scenes are a thing of beauty that should be appreciated for their own merits.Pure in its simplicity yet all the more stronger for it.

You will be left slack-jawed. Every once in a while, a new filmmaker comes along and turns a genre upside down. Writer-director Gareth Evans has just opened a new floodgate for action films using the innovative Indonesian martial art Pencak Silat, which consists of controlled body movements and literally means \"to fight artfully\".Evans and Iko Uwais collaborate for a second time, combining 'Silat' in the most claustrophobic areas of a broken-down building with knifes, guns and pretty much any weapon that's likely to give you tetanus. Imagine you're at the dead end of a skinny hallway empty-handed, and a handful of goons are coming at you with dirty machetes -- your only choice is to use your surroundings and adopt or die. Kill or be killed.Uwais and his choreography team construct these fights in an unbelievably violent, raw and exciting manner; at the same time, Evans is using the camera like an invisible person, just there watching this mayhem as it happens. Every long take and shot is impressive, and Uwais, as the lead, has the heart and passion of a young Bruce Lee. He was born to be an action star.My only complaint about \"The Raid\" is that it ended.

This is head and shoulders above the typical Chopsocky movies we've become accustomed to. Iko Uwais is Rama, a member of a police SWAT team chosen to invade the fortress-like building that has become the home of a notorious drug lord, Tama Riyadi. It is a mission to redeem the image of the police whom the public regards as inept and corrupt. In the process the squad will have to get passed several allies of the drug kingpin who will fight to the death to keep them from reaching the 15th floor where Tama is headquartered. Uwais possesses the superb fighting skills the part requires as well as the ability to make us feel that he is a human being and not some robotic killing machine. This is the kind of mission his character's been training for but he can't help but wonder who has ordered the mission at this time and why. Yayan Ruhian is Tama's chillingly sadistic henchman appropriately called Mad Dog. Unlike Rama, Ruhian's character derives enjoyment from killing with his bare hands and he's so supremely good at it that meeting him is tantamount to a death sentence. Donny Alamsyah is Andi the dollars and cents guy. Together Tama, Andi and Mad Dog form the mob's inner circle. The fight scenes are beautifully choreographed and director Gareth Evans keeps us riveted from start to finish. In the 1972 Bruce Lee film \"The Game Of Death\" the legendary martial arts master was compelled to face several obstacles and ascend several floors of a mysterious pagoda to reach the top. Likewise \"The Raid:Redemption\" tests the limits of courage and perseverance in the face of overwhelming obstacles.",

Iko Uwais (\"Man of Tai Chi\" \"Beyond Skyline\") leads a group of South Korean cops on a drug raid at an apartment building only to find themselves trapped and under siege from the residents who are controlled by the kingpin living on the top floor. The cops must fight their way up to the top floor, facing wave after wave of increasingly difficult opponents. The story is little more than an excuse to go from one action set piece to the next, but that's not always a bad thing (i.e. Walter Hill's \"The Warriors\" is one long chase but is an unabashed classic).

The basic plot is very simple: a special police unit is sent into a multi-storey housing block to take out the criminal gang that controls it and much of local crime. The killing by guns, knives and martial arts (the Indonesian 'pencak silat') is on a prodigious scale but, in between all the murder and mayhem, there is a straight-line narrative told in almost real time with a number of satisfying twists.The hero is policeman Rama played by silat national champion Iko Uwais, while the most combative villain is a character called Mad Dog portrayed by professional silat instructor Yayan Ruhian.

A new hero is born and his name is Iko Uwais! Thiz super action movie is the second collaboration with Welsh-born Director Gareth Evans since \"Merantau\" (2009) another great Indonesian movie. A group of tactical team has a mission to infiltrate into the most feared building in town, where in that place live the most notorious criminals. Thiz movie is pure adrenaline-pumping action from the very first minute. It's flooded with brutal and jaw-dropping fight scenes. Iko Uwais has shown he can do both, dramatic expressions and electrifying moves all together. There are about 20 tactical team members, none of them leaves a special impression, except for Iko Uwais's character and Joe Taslim as his team leader. But it is the bad guys who make memorable performances, most of them are scene stealers, especially for the big boss's figure which is played very convincingly by Ray Sahetapy. Sahetapy successfully represents an eccentric and frightening character. Yayan Ruhian who played as Mad Dog also deserves a memorable mention. Ruhian is no less eccentric than his boss and sometimes comical. The other Cast members are Donny Alamsyah, Iang Darmawan and Pierre Gruno. The movie cleverly inserts some effective humor for interlude. The next thing is great cinematography and lighting, it's very rare you have a decent cinematography in an action movie. It's about 30 floors to go, each floor comprises unique bad guy's characters, it instantly reminds me of Bruce Lee's \"Game of Death\" (1978) only thiz time with \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998) style. At a glance, thiz movie also reminds me of Tony Jaa's movies like \"Ong-bak\" (2003) or \"The Protector\" (2005) but if you look more thoroughly you will realize that thiz movie also has its own originality. One of them is they have shown some Pencak Silat moves, the Indonesian martial arts discipline. In summary, the first half of the movie is filled with non-stop gun fighting and the other half is about martial arts showdown. If we talk about the ending, they obviously try to put a little twist in the ending but it doesn't seem to work quite well, it could have been better. I have to tell you, if you are one of the action fans and want to taste a different kind of atmosphere, then you've come to the right place to have fun. Let's experience thiz Indonesian movie!

            "review_title": "This movie has ruined Hollywood action movies for me",
            "content": "This is probably the most adrenaline filled movie I have ever seen. The movie is basically just one long action sequence where a group of SWAT team members attempt to storm a building, a building which is controlled by a drug-lord and contains all manner of scumbags living there. The action starts almost immediately, but it is not until about 20-30 minutes when the movie gets intense. From then and on it just keep going, the only pauses you have are when the main characters tend to their injuries, and that usually does not last very long. The action, and foremost the hand to hand fighting sequences, has to be the best that has ever been put to film. Considering it is an Asian martial arts movie, you would expect it to be well choreographed, but this is just insane. It is also extremely brutal, there are a lost of stabs, neck twistings and other sorts of nastiness.As my title states this movie ruined Hollywood action movies for me, in the sense that a Hollywood action movie never would get this intense. I tried watching the Expendables 3 a few days ago, and hated every minute of it, mostly due to the horribly lame action sequences compared to this movie. The characters are not that well developed and the dialogue is not exactly Academy Award material, but it does the job and moves the plot (or in this case the action) forward. The setting is very unique and smart, a tall 30 story building with lots of hiding places and even more enemies.I would rate this movie 9/10, probably my favourite Action movie ever.",

            "content": "Watching big budget movies is predictable at times- the mass media marketing campaigns, interviews, trailers, sort of take away all the suspense, reveals plots and sets expectations. Watching relatively unknown movies on the other hand can often be a serendipitous journey- you never know when you might unearth a hidden gem. And when you do so, no force in the world should stop you from spreading the word, so here is my homage to the best action movie in decades- The Raid: Redemption.The Raid: Redemption is an Indonesian film whose USP is a nonstop goulash of brilliantly choreographed fights, the language of which is the hitherto unknown Silat. Silat refers to an ancient marital art originating from the Indonesian and Malaysian archipelago, and while on the face of it looks similar to the popular Muay Thai (Thai kick-boxing)- it differs from the latter through its ability to be unconventional- using a variety of moves including strikes, joint manipulation, throws, bladed weaponry, cheat strikes or some combination thereof, unlike Muay Thai which is a never ending hand to hand full contact strike-fest. Cutting to the plot- there is thankfully precious little, and it is a simple cops vs robbers story. The film is set somewhere in Indonesia and has a video game-like feel about it- on the right corner, are 20 elite cops, while on the left corner sits one ruthless gang-lord, and between the right and corner stands 200 henchmen, and 30 floors of hell. No need for character development or background stories- crime lord Tama based out of a dilapidated building needs to be taken down, and the cops set out to do so with righteous earnest. Unfortunately, as they find out- they are hopelessly out-gunned, out-thought and outnumbered, as it is in the best interests of residents of the building to protect their crime lord, and they do so with gusto, with guns, with machetes, with pretty much anything they can lay hands on. In a matter of minutes, most of the cops are butchered, leaving a tattered few to complete the mission. The language of the movie, and i cant stress this more, is not Indonesian, but Silat. Everyone seems to have had attained proficiency in Silat in this movie- so battle after battle, there are punches, kicks, snapped necks, broken bones, crushed skulls, dismembered body parts, exploding heads and more- all that a hardcore action fan could wish for. To the credit of director Gareth Evans is that he makes all that look poetic as well as brutal at the same time. Of special mention is the editing which makes it all seamless- no shaky camera, slow motion shots here, just pure, unadulterated, close quarter action. The camera moves all along and through the floors, and bursting walls, to capture unexplored angles and visceral, heart pounding action. Which also showcases the physical prowess of the little known actors, who unlike their flashy Western counterparts, throw no punch lines after kills, they just go about it with utmost seriousness. Speaking of actors- the hero- Iko Uwais can send Tony Jaa crying home to mommy- he has the face of a kid, but give him a villain or dozen, and he transforms into a killing machine with devastating moves, and impeccable efficiency- and to top it, he does rather deliver his few lines rather well too. The final confrontation between him and chief henchman \"Mad Dog\"- is perhaps the most intensely choreographed fight i have ever seen- they set upon each other, pardon the pun, like rabid mad dogs, and they don't know when to stop- one of them keeps slugging even with a tube-light through his throat.Bottomline, The Raid: Redemption is a path breaking movie, because it does make you forget all other action movies. It knows its audience and exceeds their expectations- pacing, energy, beauty, blood. It does enough to revive interest in an endangered genre- that of unapologetic, high testosterone action, in addition to delivering a kick that will keep drifting you to its world for days. It seems there will be a sequel as well as a big budget Hollywood remake. But part of the appeal of the movie is its raw presentation, which the Hollywood remake is sure to miss out. I am among those few who see beauty in violence, and by that account, The Raid: Redemption is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. 10/10 for hardcore martial arts action buffs- Available in DVD right about now.",

Apparently featuring non-stop creative action like we've never seen before, I was intrigued, even if it really wasn't my type of film at all. Fortunately, I guess it isn't much like a video game as I expected but it's much more of a mess. There's some interesting set pieces and they do play with them well, but it's a very uninteresting seedy universe with its saturated faux-grit in the colour grading. I've never been a fan of martial arts movies and after the first half has tedious gunplay, it moves onto kung fu which I don't find particularly engaging. The little story it does have is what makes it interesting, they should have focused on it a little more as I was confused in the end as to what happened. It does have a few cathartic moments where it is creative but otherwise it looks like an average film to me. The dubstep soundtrack doesn't help.6/10",

(R)A Jakartan SWAT team infiltrates a dilapidated tenement ruled by a vicious druglord and his gang. That's about as far as \"plot\" goes, and character development arguably fares just as poorly; this movie is just a presentation of nearly non-stop violent action scenes. Suffers for its scant human interest--a couple of plot twists in the second half don't register at all since the affected characters have no dimension beyond \"good\" and \"bad\"--but there's no arguing that the movie does precisely what it intends to do: deliver a series of adrenaline jolts, make the audience squirm when the gore gets intense, and make them pump their fists when the bludgeons, bullets and blades hit their targets. Excellent fight choreography throughout, but the shaky-cam and occasionally choppy cuts do it no favors. Like \"Dredd\" (which was released later that year and uses a very similar set-up), it will be very appealing to action/martial arts fanatics, but the cumulative experience rings a bit hollow. Given the subtitle \"Redemption\" for its US release to avoid a rights violation.72/100",

            "content": "Don't get me wrong, I loved The Raid, but I thought that I'd be sitting here and giving it a raving 10/10 from the moment I saw the jaw-dropping trailer and read all of the really positive reviews which heavily praised its action. I read that the film was quite low on plot and character development and I thought that I'd be OK with that because it's a martial-arts film, but now I realise that I'm not entirely OK with that and I do need stronger narratives and characters in order to keep me interested. Thankfully, The Raid did actually have a narrative and good characters, as well as dialogue, but it's this that takes a back seat to put the action first, which is undoubtedly some of the greatest action sequences I've ever seen.The way some people were going on, it was as if The Raid was entirely action! The tagline is even '1 minute of romance, 99 minutes of action' (or something along the lines of that). But The Raid does actually have a story even if it's a simple one. I actually like a simple plot, because it means the film remains focused and you can get really involved in it and I did! I loved the evil owner, who had zero compassion which we saw from the minute we see him, shooting people in a line for reasons we don't know about. What The Raid lacked in its first 20 minutes or so is a hero! It wasn't clear who our protagonist was, and it's hard to feel attachments to 20-odd policeman who drop like flies (although it is fun to watch). Once our clear hero does emerge the film really hit its stride, and my worries were cleansed.Our hero is a very likable guy. He has more hair than John McClane and a less he-man attitude than John Rambo! Also, he's not called John! (But he probably will be in the remake) he's a really kick-ass man who knows his martial arts as well as Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. He is also not a total caricature as we see how his pregnant wife is on his mind, and we see a complex relationship with his brother. The Raid also features some surprising plot twists which I really liked! But mostly the story is all about survival. Our hero is basically left on his own, and he has to make his way up the building to the king-pin whilst shredding his way through some martial art-loving druggy minions. No, it's MORE entertaining than it sounds! Oh yes, the main show here in The Raid is the glorious action.Someone explained that The Expendables is the male equivalent of Sex in the City. He's wrong, The Raid is! Unless you know an action-loving girl then the majority of females are going to find this boring. My sister walked out after emerging from her sleep! The Raid also far surpasses The Expendables! What was wrong with The Expendables was what is wrong with the majority of action films today, and that is that the camera shakes around way too much, and the quick cuts are so quick that, with so many angles that it's impossible to tell what is going on. Well, The Raid puts a big fat stop to all of this. The action is shot and edited perfectly. There's a little shake but no turbulence, and there are very few edits so you know what's going on!I'd call The Raid more of a martial arts/kung fu film than an action film, as the guns fall out of play quite early on, leaving a lot of breath-taking fight scenes which may upset some old-school action fans e.g. My Mum, but I couldn't help but be in awe of the outstanding choreography. It felt almost like a dance film, with the lightening-fast, fluid movements being beautifully captured. My jaw dropped in some scenes, because they were just so intensely filmed that they made me feel out of breath! I really felt transported into the film and I felt every punch and kick, which is unusual is most action films. The Raid also isn't afraid about leaving little to the imagination wither, we see every gun shot, knife wound and back break. One of the most extraordinary sequences is when during a spectacular fight they jumped out a window, and the camera follows them as they fall out the window, still fighting! It's very cool.Michael Bay and other action directors could learn a lot from Welsh-man Gareth Evans (what's he doing in Indonesia?) It's some of the best action directing I've seen since Kill Bill. I could list a load of superlatives to describe its intensity, but you still need to just experience it for yourself. The Raid is one of the best action films I've seen. I'd even controversially say that it's better than Die Hard! The Raid might've not been as deep as I'd have liked it to have been, but hopefully the sequel can surpass that. The remake wouldn't be a patch on this, unless Gareth did it and a more accomplished writer came to the table. The Raid's action sequences blew me away! It's certainly a film I could watch again and again!",

I knew as soon as I saw the trailer I'd love this and I wasn't wrong. It's the basic story of a group of Elite cops on a mission to nail a brutal crimelord. They are sent in to his high rise building to catch him. But first they must get through the increasing number of vicious bodyguards. Simple, but more than effective. It's best described, as one critic put it, as a cross between 'District 13' & 'Ong-Bak', but just as good as both. For its budget it looks incredibly good. The score works perfectly, all actors perform well (especially the lead and the 'Mad Dog' character) and it's definitely one for the lads. But when it boils down to it most people are going to go to this for the action. And f*ck me does it deliver. Bodies explode, limbs fly, throats get cut, guns blasted, heads pummelled, all done in an intricate, breakneck (get it) pace. Amongst some of the best fight scenes I've ever seen. All so unbelievable it almost seems unreal. Pure murkage. Any action film this year is going to have to work really hard to beat this film. My girl loves chick flicks etc.. but she's always game for these films and she loved it. She even said it made her want to dropkick someone on the way home. Yeah, it's that good. ****/*****",

The Raid: Redemption is one such film that tries to test this out, unfortunately, it's doing so in all the wrong ways. One word flashed through my mind when this movie finished: OVERRATED! The thing that struck me about this movie is how Kill Bill it feels. The movie reminded me of something Quentin Tarantino might have made, only more indulgent in violence, and conversations meant to build tension aren't showcased nearly as much. However, what Tarantino would have excelled at, this movie flails and fails at. Characteristically flat and inconsistently paced, the whole thing gets very tiring, very quickly. The performances come across as flat, and any genuine thrills from the action sequences are short lived, especially in the movie's final battle, which just goes on and on and on... Between the overcooked action and the dull breaks in between, the tonal shifts become a headache.Saving graces still find their way through. The action scenes feature some slick - if superfluous - choreography, and some pretty creative violence now that I think about it, and the music by Mike Shinoda and Joe Trapanese is really good (FINALLY! An electronic score that actually WORKS!), but that's as close to complimentary as I'm willing to go. I know the movie was supposed to be over the top, but you have to draw the line somewhere.

            "review_title": "A Morass of Senseless Carnage",
            "content": "\"The Raid: Redemption\" is unwatchably bad \u2013 a film that has no ambition other than to be noisy, aggressive, and relentlessly violent. Watching it is a little like being trapped in an arcade game and having absolutely no control over it. The characters, developed solely on shallow and overused clich\u00e9s, are essentially targets in a shooting gallery, most of them serving no purpose apart from awaiting their cue to die in a savage attack. There are basically three types of weapons featured in this film: (1) Guns; (2) machetes; (3) human fists. The first two are used in scenes so brainless and bloody that they transcend goofy entertainment and achieve shameless exploitation status. The third, as you may have surmised, puts the film in the category of martial arts, a genre that has nothing to offer apart from pointless spectacle.Most of the action is captured on the Queasy Cam, so even if you do appreciate martial arts, the picture is usually so shaky that the choreography is virtually undetectable. The only time the camera holds still is when someone is stabbed, or shot, or sliced, or having their backs broken or throats slit. Writer/director Gareth Evans doesn't care about a genuine adrenaline rush, nor apparently about humanizing his characters. I'm not against cinematic violence, but it can't simply be glorified. It has to have some meaning, some sense that it belongs in the story. The only way such a thing is possible is if you take the time to develop your characters into people we can actually care about. Otherwise, we have little more than pieces of meat in a grocery store \u2013 neatly saran-wrapped but giving no indication that they were once a part of something living.The film does occasionally pause to take its breath, but that doesn't mean it delves into anything resembling a plot. Not by my understanding, at least. The few scraps of information I gathered were not only maddeningly conventional but also so poorly developed that it was next to impossible to determine who was doing what and why. Even if there is a plot, it's unlikely that any potential audience will hold the slightest interest in it. All we're made to focus on is the violence, perhaps in the misguided belief that what was being depicted was escapist fun. A masked superhero getting into hand-to-hand combat with his archenemy is escapist fun; men getting their brains blown out against filthy concrete walls, on the other hand, is unpleasant and needlessly excessive.The set up, so far as I can tell, involves a gang of madmen and murderers housed up in a derelict apartment building. No rival gang is able to penetrate its walls. Neither are the police. That's because it's overseen by a ruthless crime lord named Tama Riyadi (Ray Sahetapy), who has so many surveillance cameras hidden all throughout the building that it isn't possible to get anything past him. Sent in to take the crime lord down is a surprisingly small squad of a SWAT raid team led by Lieutenant Wahyu (Pierre Gruno), a senior police officer. Many recognize this mission as a fool's errand, and so it is, although decency prevents me from telling you why. The main character is a member of this rookie team. His name is Rama (Iko Uwais), and at the start of the film, he leaves behind a pregnant wife.Rama has reasons for taking part in this mission apart from the obvious. I will not say what they are, as I'm not allowed to spoil anything for you. What I will say is that it factors into a plot twist so manufactured that it might as well listed in a rulebook of clich\u00e9s. Rama and his team navigate the floors of the building one by one, repeatedly running into ambushes of men with machine guns and machetes. I'll spare you graphic descriptions of the many bullet wounds and hack jobs shown all throughout, although I feel it necessary to warn you that one of the people killed is a boy no older than twelve. As the rookie team is decimated one by one, Rama will take part in a completely unnecessary and unresolved subplot involving a frightened tenant and his ill wife, who needs her medication.As of the date this review was written, \"The Raid: Redemption\" has earned an 83% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Am I the only one baffled by this? Exactly what is it about senseless carnage that audiences and critics find so appealing? This is an appalling movie that mistakes brutality and bloodshed for entertaining action violence. That most of this shot with cameras that appear to be caught in an earthquake doesn't help matters much, nor does the fact that the color scheme is dim and muddy. Even the blood, which basically replaces paint for the walls and floors, is an ugly dark shade, looking more like the contents of a sewer pipe than like an organic fluid. If a movie like this qualifies as praiseworthy, a serious shift in thought will soon be our only salvation.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",

Looked like we had a decent, gritty, realistic cop-drama on our hands. Then it all fell apart.First the plot started developing holes. Things started to seem contrived and implausible, and I kept thinking \"But surely they should do (that)\" and \"How is that possible?\".Worst of all, it suddenly became a martial arts movie. You know, the silly, over-the-top, very unrealistic, impossible-moves, impeccably-choreographed stuff. It started with one cop vs about 10 bad guys (and the cop winning of course), and then seemed to happen every chance the director got. It got to be so excessive, I was laughing (hey, maybe it was meant to be a comedy...). Turns out that every tenant in an apartment block is a martial arts master...Not only were the fight scenes gratuitously plentiful, silly and contrived, each scene went on and on and on - they seemed interminable. I started fast forwarding through them after a while.By now the plot had left town, as the fight scenes were there to carry the movie, leaving the movie an empty shell.A movie with much promise, most of which is wasted.

            "content": "The Raid is an explosive, all out Indonesian war as a SWAT team storm the building of a wanted drug lord and his army of tenants!.Located in the slums of Jakarta, the apartment block, considered a no-go area by police in the past, is run by a ruthless nemesis by the name of Tama (Ray Sahetapy). With previous unsuccessful attempts to bring him in, a SWAT team is ready to infiltrate the building in the cleanest way possible.Rama (Iko Uais) is just another SWAT agent hoping to come out of the \"Raid\" alive, although something tells us his participation is not accidental. A mixed martial artist, ready to ruin his fists with the blood of the ruthless mercenaries.The tactical enforcements have little knowledge of the 30 floor apartment block other than it been occupied as a safe-house for the worst kind of wanted criminals.The Raid is mind-blowing with constant non-stop action from start to finish. Its concept is typical good versus bad, but with high octane tensity, fantastic fight scenes and numerous twists to this Indonesian master piece. The Raid gives Ong-Bak a run for its money. A six minute fight scene featuring two guys on one, is just a tease of what The Raid offers fight fans.In comparison to what we have seen this summer, The Raid offers so much more in terms of gunfights so terrifying, I was only short of ducking in the cinema! Lookout for Tama's right hand man, \"Mad Dog\". A guy the SWAT are informed about on rout to the apartment block \"He will tear down walls for Tama\". He is exactly what he is made out to be. A tiny, ruthless Little character, showing his finest skills in martial arts. The consequence for the SWAT team? Bloodshed! The Raid is a terrific movie that must be seen, over and over again! I will be surprised if another action movie beats this one any time soon.Did you enjoy my review? check out my previous and up to date reviews at my blog - http://gerrysreviewsforthosecurious.blogspot.com/",

The way the cast fights make it seem so realistic and nothing too wow as in means of \"showing off\" like many actions movies. It gives you a great essence of survival battle like it should with this theme and it's totally awesome. As for the plot, I personally loved it. It was a perfect survival \"game/arena\" theme and they nailed it in a way that it seemed so real and not overreacting. I wish more movies would get made like it. The action is breathtaking.",

It was so boring as the longest chase escene ever.This is a similar concept, with no story, no arc, no nothing besides the action set pieces. And YET, they knew what they were doing and put a lot of heart on those little scenes where people talk to each other.Other than those mere minutes of dialogue and \"story\", the movie is an impossibly good set piece of martial art after the other and not a PG-13 version of it, so you would feel and see the punches. This is a very good movie overall, with a perfect runtime (contrary to the waay too long Mad Max), that does experctly what they wanted to do, put just enough heart, and its not a perfect ten, only because the \"story\" was still lacking. Even if the movie \"doesn't need a story\" because its about the action, the reality is that, it could've used a better one.One last thing. The score and sound effects/mixing was PERFECT. Often in this movies the sounds are super ultra loud for no reason, but here it was all balanced and my ears appreciated that. Also, the score is perfect too, as was the cinematography. Like I said, the technical parts of this movie were just perfect.",

So you won't see any single-strike attack to bring your opponents down, except by a bullet.The fights look so real, so beautifully choreographed. And the main actor (Iko) do have charisma in him to be a good guy. Also, the supporting actors did their roles in very correct portions. There's one actor who played as the insanely tough fight-freak, Mad Dog (Yayan) skill and fight scenes will convince you that this guy is the last guy on earth you want to make a mess with!But there are still some flaws though, scenes that will seem doesn't make a sense to you, how actors acted to solve situation. And poor story, lack of backgrounds/times that's given to develop the intended plot, especially for a betrayal intrigue, pity just make the movie looks lil bit ridiculous to me instead.If you like FREAK ACTION MOVIE! you gotta see this on theater!7.8/10",

The story was a bit thin but I just didn't care, it's an adrenalin packed action movie that for me, was just the right length. It didn't need amazing special effects, even the explosion was so realistic. I hardly ever give a 10/10 but for its genre and level of entertainment, this movie is right up there with the best.

There's nothing quite like this as you really do feel every punch and kick. The scene in-which the team realise they have walked into a death trap is one of the all-time greats and the directer pulled of a miracle with the limited budget. My only minor complaint comes from the slightly overly oppressive setting and tone, but it does add to the feeling of going through hell and back just as the lead role, and although the violence can be strong it never feels like it has gone too far or is just trying to shock, this has too much going for it for that.

Once the action begins there will be no rest for the viewer; you can feel the tiredness of the protagonists after each fight. Director Gareth Evans is a Welsh man who found fame and fortune in Indonesia, directing two of the greatest action films of all time. He's the new John Woo, and I take my hat off with him.

Its about a S.W.A.T. team who get trapped in a building ran by a ruthless mobster and full of killers and thugs. At the start, they set the the film up brilliantly with a quick and furious prep talk in the truck on the way to the building. You soon follow Roma (Iko Uwais) who plays his part very well. The fight sequences EVERY SINGLE ONE was just incredible to watch it was amazing, that said if you don't like very graphic violence than you are not gonna like it as it has a LOT of it. Personally I don't mind it when its done well, this film puts it in when necessary which realistically means a lot. When you watched each of the fights the sound of each punch, kick, and head butt (and whatever else) that, with the screams of people involved and the soft but ever going music to top made for some of the best fight scene iv watched. You really felt immersed in the tight corridors knowing you have to do anything to survive. I felt the twists in the plot were done very well but sadly weren't as surprising as they would of wanted them to be. This film was directed brilliantly the script was realistic and didn't feel fake at all which is what you need in a gritty film like this. It also helps when you have actors like Joe Taslim (Jaka) , Yayan Ruhian (Mad Dog) and Donny Alamsyah (Andi) playing their parts exquisitely well. You really believe Yayan is cold hearted killer who has no mercy. Joe played his part very well I wish we got to understand him a bit more from his point of view but thats a very small complaint. Overall i really enjoyed this movie and thought it was enthralling to watch the story unfold.",

            "content": "The Raid has been called the greatest action movie ever made. Is this true? Well i'd easily say its one of the best i've ever seen.The Raid is about a group of 20 cops that infiltrate a drug lords apartment complex and are sent their to kill him and stop their operation. During the attack, the team is found out, and now the entire building's residence are out to kill them.While the plot isn't anything special, its more then serviceable for the incredible action scenes, cinematography and tight direction.As soon as the cops enter the apartment, you'll immediately notice how dirty and sometimes even scary the place is. It's a dump. People are doing cocaine without even caring that they have their own urine on them, there are bug and rats everywhere, and even bloodstains on the walls and floors. It's extremely immersive and downright freaky.The gun fights feel real. The cops and tenants are not hesitant to fire their weapons, and they do it in a way that is intelligent. Three round bursts and head shots. The cops start getting completely over run and now have no more ammo. This is where the movie shows off the talent of the cast. Rama, played by Iko Uwais, shows off his fighting style of Silat which has never been shown in movies before. Its a brutal fighting style with lots of quick jabs and kicks. After the first fight scene your jaw will have dropped.The movie started out with the cops in a truck on their way to the apartment complex. They are chatting about the mission and the captain talks about the three main leaders. Tama(the crime lord) and his two body guards Andi and Mad Dog. Mad Dog is explained as an absolute killing machine and would easily lay his life on the line for his boss. Little do we know as viewers, Mad Dog is actually the really skinny and short guy who doesn't have an once of fat on him. \"Pulling the trigger is like ordering takeout...this is what its all about. This is the thing. This is the pulse, This. Is what I do.\" Mad Dog clenching a fist and challenging The Captain as he unloads his pistol.His first fight is against the captain. Here you will notice how fast and talented these guys are. The sheer brutality of the fight will drop your jaw even further.During this last hour, you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. In different and equally creepy parts of the apartment complex, each fight still feels fresh and fun. All of these lead to and amazing two on one fight. Rama (and another unarmed person who i won't say because it would spoil it) fight Mad Dog. It is seriously one of the greatest fight scenes ever made.The fights feel very real and luckily never use any wires. The action is all done by the actors themselves. What also surprised my was how amazing the score was. All the music was done by Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park( which I'm not really a fan of). But to my surprise, his score was absolutely perfect. Equally tense, creepy and fitting.The Raid: Redemption is easily one of the best action movies ever made and by far the best martial arts movie out there. If you're looking for an adrenaline rush, look no further. The Raid will have you glued to the screen with your jaw dropped to the floor.5/5 The Blu RayThe Picture: The picture does look very crisp, however most of the movie takes place in fairly dark areas. It's not the best picture i've seen from a blu ray, but definitely worth the upgrade from DVD. 3.5/5The Audio: Very crisp sounding. Each punch comes in clear and the soundtrack by Mike Shinoda sounds incredible on Blu Ray. 4.5/5Decision: Buy",

            "content": "You know you're having a good time when there is audience participation in a film with shouts of 'Hot him up!'; 'Box him down!'; 'Bang him up!'; 'He's a bad man!' and breathless cries and winces of 'ooh'; 'aah'; 'wow' finished off with thunderous rounds of applause and whoops of delight. Well, this was the experience I had with 'The Raid' last night and good fun it was too. Like all the best ideas, the plot is simplicity itself: a SWAT team is ordered to take out a gangland boss who has holed himself up in a 15 floor tenement block along with the worst criminals in the city which they all call home, the plan goes wrong and all hell breaks loose in an orgy of carnage (some involving white goods), bone breaking and bloodletting that is perfect Friday night post pub and pre-curry entertainment.Iko Uwais is a star in the making and has an impact equal to Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and Tony Jaa when they made their breakout films in 'The Big Boss', 'Drunken Master' and 'Ong Bak' respectively. A real practitioner of the Indonesian martial art of Pencak Silat, Uwais is a deadly whirlwind of flying feet, hands and elbows. Three standout scenes showcase his skills, but the best of them is the first when he is cornered by four dangerous goons in a narrow corridor and takes them out in an exhilarating blur of hand and feet co-ordination made all the more exciting by the daggers that appear to be stuck permanently to his gloves as lethal appendages. You genuinely won't have seen anything like it before, yet it's a derivative martial arts/action movie, but one that feels as fresh and inventive as the country it comes from and guaranteed to set your pulse and blood racing.The man responsible for this wondrous hit is Gareth Evans, a once innocuous Welshman, whom you suspect will have Hollywood and more specifically ageing actions stars like Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Willis and Statham beating a path to his door to replicate the successful formula with this calling card of a film. Of course, the Hollywood rights have already been bought up and this will surely be re-set in downtown L.A. with a bigger budget, more bang for the buck and hi-tech gadgetry ranging from laser targeting scopes to night vision goggles to the latest gunporn. Whether it will have the same terrific touches of the original, however, remains to be seen unless Evans is asked to direct the Hollywood remake. The illuminated silhouettes of deadly criminals on an upper floor waiting to ambush the SWAT team in the dark against the flash of gunfire, and the breathless tension created by a machete slicing into the cheek of our hero hiding behind a partition wall from searching goons linger long in the mind.Evan's overnight success is so remarkable that it can only appear in a Hollywood script or be true. A post graduate in script writing at the University of Glamorgan Evans met and married an Indonesian woman who used her contacts to get her husband a directing gig in her native Indonesia and so they moved to Jakarta. The directing job turned out to be a documentary on Indonesian martial arts which is where Evan met Uwais, who was a student at the Silat school, and together they made their first martial arts film called Merantau (Warrior) in 2009 which has since gone on to popular and critical success. Evans is now preparing to direct the sequel to 'The Raid' called Berandal (Thug) with presumably a bigger budget and a wider international audience to satisfy. If it's half as good as the original, I for one, cannot wait. Bigger challenges lie in wait for Evans the Director; namely whether he can turn Uwais into a genuine long-term action star with crossover appeal in the West (note the disappearance of Tony Jaa and his straight to video sequel of Ong Bak 3), and whether he can widen his brief as an action director. For now, though, I welcome the arrival of genuine new talents in Evans and Uwais and applaud the dizzy excitement of 'The Raid'.",

            "content": "The tag line on the American poster describes this film to be \"The Best Action Film in Decades.\" I won't go as far as being THE BEST, but I will agree that the action scenes blew me away! The choreography during these fights were absolutely incredible to watch. Another thing that worked for me was the camera work and how visible each sequences were. The main problem with films lately is the usage of shaky camera movement that does cause me to loose interest in the action scenes. The action scenes captured every movement easily and followed each bone crunching punches and kicks and every kill to leave you jaw dropped. Each fight scenes were memorable, amazing and it is hard to lose interest as the fights go into full maximum drive.Despite the incredible choreography and the jaw dropping action sequences, there were certain gripes within the film that have caused me to drop the grade. My main concern within this movie is that the pacing goes to a complete halt during the segments of dialogue and the character developments. It really felt like driving a car at full maximum speed and coming to a complete stop because of a traffic light. I'm not fully saying that it's not relevant and was unnecessary, but because of the adrenaline paced action sequences, the moments of dialogue really caused the pacing to drop. Another flaw that I found was the lack of details toward the main character. You know that he has a pregnant wife, a rookie on the SWAT team, can kick some serious butt and has a brother who left home, but that is all you will ever know about the character. The film mentions for a brief moment about the family issues, but there is nothing much more that was mentioned throughout the film. Probably a possible sequel will explain about certain details that were left out in this film; however, this is the only gripe that I carry in the film.The story is sure simplistic and does lack character depth for you to care about the other characters in the film. However, despite that, the action scenes are very enjoyable and will enjoy the full ride from start to finish.",

Meanwhile, there seems to be something else happening that brought the team here in the first place. Holy moly, let's address the elephant in the room first, the action sequences. Wow. Just wow. The choreography is absolutely fantastic. Every fight is amazingly fluent, everything flows together perfectly, and it's just plain epic. Seriously, this some of the greatest action I've ever seen. If your going to see this movie for anything, you see it for how absolutely brutal, yet fantastically made, the action is. The story itself isn't heavily focused on, but it works. The way it's written makes it actually more realistic because not everything is just laid out for the audience and explained. The characters talk about the plot in a way where they aren't explaining everything to the audience, they're just talking like they both know everything about their conflict already. Unfortunately, the plot then ends up being a little unclear by the end, but at least the movie doesn't treat us like babies. Overall The Raid: Redemption is fantastic. The action is amazing and the story is well-written. As far as anything else goes, it's not great, but it doesn't need to be. It's not going for an amazing plot or anything, it's going for amazing action and by golly it delivers. It's an action movie through-and-through, and there's no real reason to judge it based on anything but that. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie.",

Some films trick you into thinking it will be as great as the trailer makes it out to be, if you thought the trailer was exciting, the film will have you saying holy Sh!t at least once. this film begins and ends with two words : No Bullsh!t. This movie is pure action and the plot is simple which is why I don't need to explain it but this is not your average action film. This film contains some of the most intense, wild and crazy action sequences I've ever seen!! and even contains a few plot twists make it more thrilling and exciting. Action Junkies will love this and is highly recommended if you fall into that category.Overall : 8/10",

It is very brutal and there is plenty of gore so it's definitely not one for the squeamish. All the performances were excellent, I watched it in its native Indonesian with subtitles so I could better judge and I felt nobody missed a beat. I loved the music, it kept the pace of the film very well and added to the excitement of the fight scenes where needed. The time really flew (which is always a good sign) and, although there were a couple of quiet moments, it's pretty much full on all the way! I did like the plot as well; there were references to police corruption and also a nice little twist with one of the drug lord's men. Over all, it's one of the best martial arts films I've seen for quite a while! A definite 'must see' for any fan of the genre.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDMy score: 9.4/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",

            "content": "Quite honestly some of the best martial arts I've EVER seen. That could the be the entire review as it was pretty much the whole film. This film was low on story (what there was was predictable), but exceedingly high on action and graphic gore. In terms of action, this film was ground-breaking; the violence was up close and visceral - you saw knives going in, bullets blowing faces off and things going through people. I don't know how they did some of those SFX. I had no idea what this film was about, had no preconceptions, and thought it was a heist film, and didn't even know it had subtitles, thankfully the subtitles didn't subtract from the film as there wasn't much plot and most of the story was visual. I was pleasantly surprised but it's not what you would call a \"pleasant\" film, not uplifting or happy. However, it's amazing.Hats off and most honourable mention to Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhian, the two actors, martial artists, stuntmen who carried this film... their fighting skill was mindblowing, original and unbelievably good. We had to rewind a few scenes as we just couldn't believe what we thought we'd just seen! I've never seen fight scenes like it. These two actors hopefully will become household names across the world not just in Indonesia... In a previous review I said that the film Warrior made Rambo and Predator look like a Disney film... this film made Warrior look like Finding Nemo. Well not quite, Warrior does have Tom Hardy! I would love to see a martial arts film with Ruhian, Uwais, Jackie Chan and Tiger Hu Chen as despite it being a very violent film, there was still some humour amongst the tense, nail-biting bits, but I missed the improvisation of Chan and the beautiful style and grace of Chen! Then by some miracle if you could get some Bruce and Brandon Lee... in there as well... you would have an EPIC. Whilst there was some bad language there wasn't anything in the film that was truly \"bad\" other than a high death toll, which doesn't really bother me, and the simple premise gave 100% focus to the fight scenes which were stunning.If you can bear the blood and gore, this is a cinematic treat.",

Iko Uwais who plays Rama is an amateur cop who has just started in the Jakarta SWAT team at first he sees his team mates being shot down but Rama gets very brave and shows his skill in the Indonesian Martial art Penciak Silat. In one scene there is ten minutes of pure awesomeness when Rama and his brother fight against one man Mad Dog (Yayan Ruhian) in the end though the protagonist will always win. In the en though the mob leader gets shot in the head and that soon ends the awesome film that is The Raid. 10/10 gory and wonderful. Really want to watch the second one.",

The cinematography, for the most part, is great and displays some really unique and experimental shots.\n7. Both Iko Uwais (Rama) and Yayan Ruhian (Mad Dog) give fantastic physical performances.\n8. The movie is very well-paced. It's quick which gives the film an appropriately high-octane feel, but it's not too fast so you can still be invested in the characters and the goings-on.Cons:\n1.

            "content": "Martial arts action movies have been wowing moviegoers since the '70s when a man named Bruce Lee dazzled us on screen with his amazing fighting abilities and physical prowess. Since then, we've seen many great films dedicated to giving us non-stop ass-kicking, but none can hold a candle to the testosterone-fueled carnage known as The Raid: Redemption.The concept is simple. There's a ruthless crime lord who operates out of a 30-story tenement that he owns. A small group of SWAT members are sent in to take him out. Sh*t goes bad; chaos ensues. There's a five-minute explanation of what's about to go down, and we're introduced to the main characters, both good and bad. After that, the action begins, and it doesn't let up until the brutal end. Sure, there are a few lulls in the violence, but that's mainly so we can catch our breath.While in most cases, a lack of a fully fleshed-out storyline would be a problem with a film, it's not an issue with The Raid. There's just enough story to give the characters some depth, and the action knows when to let up just before the point of pure exhaustion.Compelling plot aside, the real reason this film is so fantastic is the unbelievable action scenes. Director Gareth Evans was able to use the plot and location to his advantage, by having the characters deal with a bevy of gunplay at the beginning but then having to resort to knives and hand-to-hand combat as munitions run out. The dilapidated building itself plays a large part in the film and made up for some of the movie's most suspenseful moments.The fight choreography was also like nothing I've ever seen before. The Indonesian martial art of Pencak Silat was mind blowing and extraordinary to watch, and the complexity of some of the more intricate fights was simply jaw dropping.The camera-work, editing, and cinematography do their part to enhance an already visually pleasing film. While some movies go the route of shaky cameras and fast cuts, The Raid doesn't hide anything. The precise tracking shots and long takes are masterfully done, and it's almost as if the filmmakers are saying, \"This is how you film an action movie; suck it Tony Scott.\" A quote on the poster for The Raid is \"The best action movie in decades,\" a fairly strong statement. Fortunately, it's true; there really hasn't been anything like this film in decades. It doesn't just raise the bar, it stabs the bar in the throat and throws it out of a window. It will blow you away and leave you craving more. Thankfully, we have two sequels in the works, but I really can't imagine making a finer action film.Adam FilmPulse.net",

            "content": "Martial arts has always been a fascination to the world at least in the movies since Bruce Lee's foray into Hollywood. The same enthusiasm has been carried forward by Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Tony Jaa and the likes in their own style while adapting to changing times. Thus far, the primary combination has always been that of martial arts, modern technology and modern crime world along with a healthy dose of PG entertainment thrown in with occasional fantasy setups and animation. With 'The Raid: Redemption', it is taken to a whole new territory of gore, grit and overall graphic violence which marks a definitive shift in its target audience while putting the Indonesian movie industry in the global map of cinema along the way.Rama (Iko Uwais) is a rookie in the tactical police team which has been assigned to engage a crime syndicate operating from an apartment building. The team is led by Jaka (Joe Taslim) based on the intel procured from Wahyu (Pierre Gruno) and the operation was expected to be quick and silent. The mob boss Tama (Ray Sahetapy), his muscle Mad Dog (Yayan Ruhian) and brain Andi (Donny Alamsyah) along with a huge network of spotters (generally children), surveillance cameras and mercenaries was underestimated by the tactical team. The whole operation goes downhill as soon as it starts with body count rising and a never ending barrage of bad guys popping up in every corner. Rama and Wahyu have their own agenda amid all the chaos. Can they make it out alive?You get a similar scenario as that of 'Black Hawk Down' where a large and sophisticated military team go into Somalia for a quick and clean mission but end up losing many men and the rest scared and desperate to get back in one piece. 'The Raid' isn't about getting back in one piece but to pursue on relentlessly and at the same time playing for the masses every opportunity it gets. The graphic violence and the gore is on another level compared to movies of this genre. Even though there are a lot of gun battles, there are even more fist and knife fights which is where things get murkier. Skulls crushed, arms and legs broken, spines twisted, jaws cracked, torsos slashed and blood everywhere. Definitely not your average action movie. Considering the entire story is just the movie's namesake - a raid, even though the twists, revelations, human relationships etc. are all projected with the right intensity and strategically timed - it is the visual display of those martial arts combined with graphic violence that wins big for it. The action choreography is very innovative where the kicks and punches come in lightening pace and bodies are crushed in ways a normal viewer wouldn't have imagined. Complementing it is the excellent cinematography where each kick and punch is captured and projected with the maximum intensity for genre audience's pleasure. Generally the acting in Asian movies are a little overboard, but 'The Raid' makes sure the standard is very different from normal by maintaining the correct tone and the actors are to be commended for it. With a short runtime, crisp screenplay and enough twists in the script to keep the viewer engaged, the movie is a complete package for whoever can stomach the gore and violence.Not your average martial-art themed action flick, but every other can become a child's play after seeing this.",

He is next inside an armored truck with fellow heavily armed SWAT team members, on their way to a building controlled by a powerful mobster. Once they gain entry, all hell breaks loose.As the team advances floor by floor, they encounter residents with automatic rifles, and are killed off like fish in a bowl, except for the leader and two other cops, including Rama, who exhibits Bruce Lee style fighting skills, repeatedly in several well done battles. We know that it will lead up to a final confrontation with the best opponent at the end. The violence is over the top and the story fairly typical, with competent acting and good camera work.

In that way there would have been less victims among the cops.The action, fighting scenes, were awesome! Yayan Ruhian was gruesome. This fight he had against the two brothers in the small room was terrific. This guy went on and on, he was just a beast.

It sets this out and it duly delivers, the close shots of the team even as they just travel in latches onto this and we can see the narrow margins that bestow them. The film does very well on a small budget and takes a lot of practical effects and delivers them well. The start of the film consists of mostly shoot out between the team and the thugs. The sheer noise and intensity of the stand off made it more realistic. When watching big budget films usually put in larger setting I for one never really believe that they are firing but in this film I completely believed it and without trying to sound too clich\u00e9 about it I really believed I was in the room with them. It continues this way most of the film with the hand to hand combat scenes thankfully not shot in shaky cam. The dialogue is much to be expected and doesn't stand out as anything special but the acting is decent throughout and there aren't really any cheesy death scenes or over the top emotional moments. It works in a video game sense with many fights leading up to the final boss if you will. It is certainly not for the faint hearted and is just about as gritty as a martial arts film can get. There are no real scenes consisting of a beat down and the the recipient simply crawling off screen. You see the details in some graphic detail and this may put some people off straight away. All in all, do check out The Raid, it is a chilling film at times and the action is brilliantly done on such a small budget.",

And death. By a...door? (That may be a spoiler, however slight, so I forewarned). So give this movie a fighting chance, arm yourself with popcorn, and get ready to kick it. It feels fresh, realistic, and brings the viewer in somehow right in with the characters. I'd compare this phenomenon with Casino Royale, where it feels unscripted, yet you know it is. 8.5 outta 10 (I rounded up I guess, I couldn't decide between 8 & 9 so I went with 9). Enjoy. Oh, and definitely not for kids, it's kinda bloody and sweary (ya know, full of swear words).",

Thank God I DVR'd it, because I want to watch it a couple more times.I'm amazed at the critics on here who nitpick it for lack of character development, insufficiently literate dialogue (it's subtitled, for God's sake. And the characters are a SWAT team in Indonesia, not a bunch of college professors sitting around a table ruminating on the meaning of life), and the occasional errant CGI blood effect.Some pretentious twit from Australia wrote that \"Not everyone is as enthusiastic about violence as this sadistic and purposeless series\", in reference to the sequel (YES!!!!!!). All I can say to that is, \"Not everyone has to watch it\". I loved it.The best action movie I think I've ever seen, with the most fight scenes, gun play, and most of all (though I've never seen an actual killing), the most realistic-looking deaths in a long time.But if it sounds like this will be just another Hollywood-style blood-fest, with laughable action scenes and totally cheesy characters (think \"Commando\" or any Steven Seagal movie), you couldn't be further from the truth. The camera-work, the music, the whole atmosphere created kept me from looking away for an instant, and kept me on the edge of my seat, totally immersed. Rent it, buy it, DVR it, but watch it.",

            "content": "I had heard the film hailed as the greatest thing since Hard Boiled, perhaps even greater than John Woo's magnum opus. That was an exaggeration, but it was still very good. The Raid is a brutal and violent movie. Its plot involves an Indonesian SWAT team infiltrating a criminal stronghold... a 15-story building occupied almost exclusively by violent criminals protecting the criminal mastermind at the top. The SWAT team makes it about a third of the way up before an alarm is sounded. A slaughter of the police quickly ensues, leaving the few survivors trapped with men seeking to kill them above and below. Oh, and they either lose their guns or run out of ammo. What this sets up is about an hour and a half of near non-stop martial arts. The fighting is well choreographed, although editing occasionally broke the 180 degree rule. It's a pet peeve. Still, this is better than 99% of what Hollywood typically puts out. Fight sequences aren't butchered by quick cuts, and we can see that everyone here actually knows what they're doing. A bunch of stunt men clearly risked life and limb, and it shows.The Raid also boasts solid suspense. One highlight I'd like to share: two SWAT officers are hiding in a small hidden room behind a wall. A criminal with a machete suspects they're there and begins stabbing through the wall. The stabbing inches closer and closer until it slices the cheek of the protagonist. You see, his head is pinned between one end of the room and the machete, forcing him to stay there and suppress his instinct to scream while the criminal gets distracted and walks away for a while, leaving the machete behind. And when he comes back to pull it out, our hero puts his glove on the blade to wipe off the cheek blood. Hitchcock would be proud. Where The Raid falls short is in emotional investment. It's superior to the recent Navy SEAL movie Act of Valor, but where that movie succeeded was its emotional impact, particularly near the end. Both movies have a protagonist with a pregnant wife, but The Raid made that a fact rather than an emotional reality. So we're left with some very cool action and a respectable score by Mike Shinoda, but it's just not as satisfying as it might have been. Hard Boiled it is not. But not every movie can be. The Raid is nonetheless a solid entry from a country we haven't seen much from. 8/10",

The whole endeavor feels like the second coming of a young John Carpenter, complete with minimal synth soundtrack (by Mike Shinoda), ramping tension and close quarters environment. Fantastically directed, with almost every creative decision in service of the action. The martial arts (the style is Pencak Silat) work in this is astounding and incredibly fast. Lead Iko Uwais and villain Yayan Ruhian, who both choreographed all the fight sequences, are freaking unstoppable machines. Particularly Ruhian, who has got to be the most dangerous dude I've seen put on film in years. The action is inventive, fast, edgy as hell and totally driving.

The lead actor is hugely charismatic, and the subversion of the genre in the end, the fact that it is the good guys who double-up on the bad guy and and not the other way round, was gleefully transgressive.

Between the subtle, yet recognizable story and the gruesome (without being over-gory) non-stop action scenes, this movies finds itself in the top of my own personal arsenal of great Indonesian films. Not only is all of the music's soundtrack produced by Linkin Park's very own Mike Shinoda and Deftone's Chino Moreno, but the film also stars budding actor, Iko Uwais, an amazing Silat fighter from Indonesia (also stars in director Gareth Evan's Merantau).If you get the chance to see this movie prepare to be both horrified and unified by this film.

            "content": "When it comes to sheer, unrelenting action, 'The Raid (2011)' is hard to beat. Though the premise is simple, the plot doesn't just feel like an excuse for all its chaos. That's primarily because the storytelling is efficient, not basic. It portrays its narrative as something that's part of a wider world while still making it feel holistic, a fast-paced rollercoaster ride with a few twists and turns for good measure. The major characters aren't just cardboard cut-outs, either. They're archetypes, yes, but they have a decent amount of depth to them and are presented in a remarkably compelling light. The protagonist, Rama, is made instantly empathetic by a brief but important sequence showcasing his home-life and pregnant wife. While this isn't exactly unique, it's absolutely vital and it - along with a few other moments along the way - establishes our lead as someone you genuinely want to survive the eponymous raid-gone-wrong. After a suspenseful build-up, the piece explodes in a hail of bullets, bolo knives and brutal beatings. Make no mistake: this is a survival film. Its insurmountable odds truly feel insurmountable, as an endless parade of thugs mercilessly hunt down our trapped heroes. The picture achieves a brilliant balance between edge-of-your-seat tension and pulse-pounding action. Though it's the latter that typically gets the most attention, the former is equally as important in making the thing as gripping and exciting as it is. Having said that, the action is spectacular. Thanks to handheld camerawork, crunchy sound design and impactful gore, the fight sequences hit as hard as possible. They're fast, frenetic and brutal, choreographed to perfection. They're some of the best in the genre and are a treat to experience, always complimenting the wider narrative while telling their smaller tales. When it comes down to it, the action doesn't work as well on its own as it does in the context of the wider film, which proves that the flick is much more than just a compilation of set-pieces. It's atmospheric and enthralling throughout. 8/10",

Why would a specially trained commando unit go and cry on his dead friend to wake up and leave the suspect unguarded? Why would a spec ops leave his gun on the floor if he is surrounded by enemies ? And so many other questions came to my mind during watching this. It was like every scene had something badly done. In one scene enemies open a door on one floor while the whole building is filled with wooden walls , injured spec ops screams like little kid from pain , but heck the enemy is def and cannot hear him screaming so they start to search (while being few meters from the screaming guy).Few minutes after he screams painfully again but the movie shows that the whole floor hears it.Why are there so many unbelievable stupid moments in this movie ? I understand its an action movie , but it should have at least some real elements to be believable. To me this was like a \"commando from the playground\" . The plot is nonexistent and the whole movie is filled with fighting scenes so unnatural and unbelievable that I wonder what the other reviewers actually saw !? Some ppl might complain that Expendables is the same , yes in unbelievable action moments , true , but it has some kind of humor and the whole is more like a comedy .While this movies tries to be dead serious. The only thing laughable ,is the sea of clich\u00e9 and silly moments. The special effects are so unreal as well. If you shoot someone in the eye with a sniper rifle , the body will fly away and decimating the head.In this movie the victim just stands still , leans forward then drops on floor like he was shot with a freaking paint-ball gun.

The Raid gets the Most anticipated Indonesian movies ever since the Director made a blog about the upcoming project of his movie called the raid, then it goes to a local forum in Indonesia called Kaskus (which also happens to be the biggest forum in Indonesia), and before long, the attention come to this project until eventually this movie proved itself in a premiere in a local festival called INAFFF (Short for: Indonesia Internasional Fantastic Films Festival). The Raid gets a Massive praise from the early review, and went abroad to a foreign festival where it too get a critical acclaimed and won the Midnight Madness Award in TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival), and This, is the Beginning of the successful story of The Raid.. But enough with the wikipedia..The Raid tell us a story about a group of a local SWAT-look-alike Police Squad, consist of 18 man including a rookie member Rama (Iko Kuwais), trying to Raid a 15 floor height Apartment Block that shelter the most wanted bad ass criminal led by a Crime Lord called Tama Riyadi (Ray Sahetapy) and two of his most trusted man, the brutal Hit-man 'Mad Dog' (Yayan Ruhian) and Tama's right hand man 'Andi'. The SWAT Team, led by Sergeant Jaka (Joe Taslim) and supervised by Liutenant Wahyu (Pierre Bruno), then got trapped by the alarmed resident, and must fight for they survival. a very recycle bin plot. But sometimes, when the other part of the movies is so shining, the plot doesn't matter anymore.\"Please, enjoy yourself..\" said Tama the Crimelord while he instructing all the criminal to find and kill all of the SWAT Group with the intercom that broadcasts in the whole apartment. And soon, The massive Horde of criminal are raiding them back with guns and knife and machete and a martial art skill that they have. This movie promises us action and blood, and thats what it delivers, A gunfight scene and a martial art called 'Silat' with a fatal move featuring of bone crunching, blood spilling, neck breaking in about 3/4 duration of the movie. Its soo brutal and violent that the foley artist must be having a hard time finding correct sound to fill the brutally martial arts scene. Speaking of that, the results of that fighting sound effect is actually great, a mandarin martial art films great, and the fact that this movie is from Indonesia, i think the foley artist should get an award for his work in the local awarding festival.The fighting itself is absolutely mesmerizing. The beautiful 'Silat' Martial Art choreographed by Yayan Ruhian and Iko Kuwais, and with the mix use of quick cut, editing, and camera angle are creative enough to refresh the genre and entertain the viewers, the fatal move is so brutal and yet realistic that will keep you glued to your seat for the entire movie. You may know how the character is gonna be dead, but what you don't know is how. And with a great background music composed by Fajar Yuskemal and Ario Prayugi (in Indonesian Version), The Raid is really delivering the action with a guaranteed satisfaction.One thing that The Raid lack of is, the dialogue. it is so corny if you understand Indonesian. But, if you don't speak BAHASA, you might find it okay. The cast are okay, but not so good. the veteran Ray Sahetapy is just brilliant. His deep voice, his gesture, and his sometimes innocent words are the living breath of Tama the Crime Lord. While Iko Kuwais is not convincing enough for me as a SWAT team. But its only a minor flaws that are forgettable when you see this movie.This is a new level of Indonesian Cinema. It may look just awesome in Hollywood industry, but it means a lot for the Indonesian film Industry. its not just the action that made us, the indonesians, watch it and praise it, its the production value of the film. The value that we hope will be followed by all Indonesian movies afterwards.------------------sorry for the grammar.. i know its bad, but i think you know what i mean :)",

Me included.I always cite 'Die Hard' as the greatest action movie and while that still remains the case, there's no denying that 'The Raid' does a damn good job of coming close. It's a relentless thrill ride, with some truly pulse pounding action sequences and importantly... it's shot with competent camera-work, crisp editing and assured direction. THIS is how you make an action film.The setup is beautifully simple; a vicious drug lord controls a huge apartment block in Jakarta, where he rents out the rooms to dealers, murderers and any other scumbag who needs to lay low. The block is considered a no-go area for police, until one morning, when a squad of 20 or so SWAT members infiltrate it. The plan is to work up to the fifteenth floor where Tama is hiding, and extract him. Sounds simple enough, until the cops are spotted and Tama orders the residents to take them out.Our hero, Rama, is the rookie cop with a pregnant wife at home. Naturally he's also a martial arts master and capable of kicking serious a** while still showing a degree of vulnerability... he's John McClane meets Bruce Lee.What works so well with 'The Raid' is the way that the action develops from shootouts, to knife fights and finally to bare fists. There's also a wonderfully eerie vibe which takes over during the first hour, when the cops split up and try to hide from the army of machete-wielding thugs chasing them down. There are siege elements of 'Assault on Precinct 13' and other John Carpenter films, while the blood flies like a John Woo classic.The fisticuffs on display here are exhilarating and it's a wonder that the entire cast didn't end up in hospital after filming. The choreography is creative, smart, brutal and not since the arrival of Tony Jaa 10 years ago have I been so impressed by one man's athleticism. The final 3-way duel is undoubtedly the high point, although a hair-raising machete fight earlier on is particularly good.If you're here looking for a plot or deep characters, then you may be disappointed. Having said that, because the film is so efficient and well paced, what character and plot we DO get is done well enough to engage and fill in between the action. Once the action is finished, the climactic scenes don't quite have the same impact but really that's a minor quibble. The soundtrack is surprisingly good too, gradually building and adding layers, fitting the action beat for beat.I will definitely see this again before it ends it's run at the cinema. It's destined to be one of those films you can put on late at night when you've had a hard day and just need to be entertained. GO SEE IT!",

            "content": "It baffles me that a subtitle \"Redemption\" must be added to the name of the movie, which is already perfect as it is - \"The Raid\". Adding the subtitle to the movie merely adds nothing more but confusion, as the audience will be looking for a character looking for that trait. Roger Ebert in his review gave the movie 1 out of 4 stars and expressed his bewilderment over this issue. As if the subtitle will make the movie sound cooler than it already is.No matter. \"The Raid\" is quite essentially one of the most brutal and violent, and most relentless since John Woo's \"Hard-Boiled\", action thriller ever made. Think the 30-minute shootout in \"Hard-Boiled\" and fight sequences in \"Ong-Bak\" and \"Tom-Yum Goong\" combined and stretched into 90 minutes and you get \"The Raid\". It is a gung-ho exercise in style and choreography. To criticize the plot is in futility. It's killed or be killed. Simple but effective, like it's lead character Rama, the film aims straight for the jugular.Responsible for this rush are rapidly-rising Indonesian martial-arts star Iko Uwais and Welsh director Gareth Evans, the same team who brought us the impressive \"Merantau\" years ago. Like \"Merantau\", \"The Raid\" is chock-laden of adrenaline pumping action sequences and elaborately-choreographed Silat-infused fight sequences. Unlike the former, however, \"The Raid\" unleashes Silat at its brutal bone-breaking, head-busting, neck-snapping, gut-slashing, knife-stabbing, kneecap- crushing best. Uwais clearly establishes himself as a now-dominant force in the martial-arts movie industry, and can proudly rank himself up there with fellow modern martial-arts pain mongers Donnie Yen and Tony Jaa (whom he resembles apparently). He also manages to give out some acting chops, unlike most martial-arts stars today. Evans is also on the same path in terms of action-filmmaking, his frenetic and kinetic direction really rivets the film into a visceral viewing experience.Thanks to some gritty cinematography and production design, \"The Raid\" immerses the audience into the situation at hand, although (sadly I have watched the American release) the music score does not somehow do the job in some scenes. The ending, I feel, is a bit of a cop-out. Too often modern action movies end this way, and I really hoped it would be like how the 80's-90's action films ended - with a bang instead of a puff.Does the film glorify violence? There is certainly non-stop brutal and sadistic bloody violence that it could be called a game-changer for action films. I would have to say that - yes, the film does indeed glorify violence, but in that 80s-90s way in which the clearly- established-as-evil bad guys are mowed down relentlessly by the good guys as the audience cheers in support of the heroes. The same thing happened here. The audience I went with was small, but they were all whooping whenever a goon gets dispatched with style.\"The Raid\" could be a hit, if the marketing would improve. Is it one of the best action movies ever made - a game changer? Not really. But it is definitely one of the most brutal and relentless of recent times. Let's hope Hollywood doesn't come-a-calling so soon...Overall rating: 69/100",

            "content": "A group of elite policemen is to raid Indonesia's largest drug house. It starts pretty well, but then it takes a turn for the worse. Both the tenants and the drug lord's henchmen start chasing the police and it gets really brutal. They are stuck in a 30-story building with only one way out: fight.The score is great. The music helped create a very tense atmosphere. Not only is it phenomenal choreography but the beginning of the film when they are sneaking around with their rifles is very exciting. It's a bit worrying as enemies can come from all possible corners. Then it explodes and you are stunned by what you witness.Great choreography combined with exceptional photography. It makes up for it if you have the world's best martial artist in front of the camera lens if the photo sucks. The film contains perhaps the best action choreography of this century. Surprisingly brutal and impressive action. I grimaced and turned in my seat several times. It's very well done, but after a while, it becomes repetitive and almost boring.The movie is so ugly, disgusting, and almost too brutal. The film takes place in a large madhouse with people who inject everything possible into their bodies. There will be some poor variation in the environment so all the fight scenes will be almost too similar. Then some fight scenes go on for an awfully long time with a slightly unrealistic number of blows that could potentially kill. The last 20 minutes feel quite repetitive and boring, even though what actually happens on the screen is magical.But the environment is also one of the film's strong points. The corridors are narrow and the rooms are small; it gets a little claustrophobic and the fights get more intimate. The police have to solve many problems to get around the house without attracting attention. They don't want to be stuck in a room surrounded by 30 men. Perhaps the rooms should be designed a little differently for better variety, but at the same time, it is a little special that everything is so boring, ugly, and disgusting.The film consists of over 90 minutes of constant action. But there is also some interesting drama between the two brothers. It is similar to John Woo's \"A Better Tomorrow\". I honestly didn't understand the main story, but I don't care either. I think there were some twists and such but not sure. A bit limited with character development too perhaps.It's a very simple film, but everything is very well executed. It's a very dark and brutal film, but worth seeing. You won't find much more intense and mind-blowing action than this. Very good movie. 7.5/10.",

A concept little similar as well as the more recent and harsh \"Lone Survivor (2013)\". The movie is well done considering that takes place all within a building. It is fun despite very exaggerated, the fight scenes (martial arts) are excellent and bloody, the athletes are talented, but the main key players are not thorough, the acting isn't great and therefore the viewer could remains slightly detached and not too exciting as it could have been, to me. Also the script is a bit dull while the photography is pretty good.The sequel (The Raid 2) is well connected, and it offer more various \"dance of the death\" choreography and it is actually, despite obvious, almost better.If you are a martial arts fan, you should watch both for sure, if not, well, do not expect deep and meaning movies so that you could enjoy them at least for the fighting harsh bloody and violent scenes and the no-stop action.7/10",

Forget twists, plot turns, narrative devices, and give us balls-out, no holds barred action scenes.The choreography of the fight scenes is stunning, so much effort has been put in that you should watch it for that alone! There are some real scenes of tension to counteract the bone-crunching violence, and this just makes for a superb pacing throughout the movie. The acting is top-notch, and the fact that is was directed by a Welshie makes it even better!

            "content": "This may be the best pure action film in recent memory. The setup is sparse, a SWAT team is about to storm a gangland tenement. What they don't know is that the place is crawling with slumdogs armed to the teeth and desperate to please the mad dog kingpin who runs his drug business from there.The basic appeal here is that you get three movies rolled into one, and nimble , seamless transitions from one to the next - a warzone movie in the Black Hawk Down mode, bonkers exploitation in the middle, and devastating hand-to-hand combat after the first hour. It is as intense as you've heard.The Indonesians had a booming exploitation film industry up until the mid-90's, a bevy of escapist fare for the blue-collar worker coming back from his shift in the factory or American-owned oilrig. And they do have their own pretty dirty martial arts similar to the Thais and Filippinos, called silat. All the fights you see in the film are in this style.What both these things have in common is a strong background in magical tradition, in their b-movies this is reflected in the frequent trope of evil sorcerers, wizards and ancient curses. Lady Terminator, which I have seen, opens with an evil goddess having a snake exorcised out of her vagina by a sailor. In silat, as American practitioners will report now that it's picking up there, a shroud of mysticism and supernatural belief surrounds the art which in turn reflects its rainforest roots (Buddhist to an extent).The striking thing is that there's none of that here. The film is made for a global action-oriented market. But it's fun to note that they somehow seep in there. The filmmakers suck you in with realistic tension from the SWAT scenario and gritty slum setting, then bit by bit they begin to stitch into it the crazier elements, which make this what it is, the supple sweep of the viewer from the 'real' world into the whirlpool of movie fantasy.They have their cake and eat it too, smartly avoiding both your typical cop flick and the more overt Rodriguez cartoon.And they have learned from the Chinese. The silat in the film looks explosive and 'alive' but the dance choreography is every bit as elaborate as in Jet Li's wushu. Like Jet Li, it helps a great deal that the lead guy (and probably others) is an actual fighter and not a movie actor simply coached on the moves.What lets the film down is the formulaic human drama; a pregnant wife back home, a brother on the opposing side. Rehashed elements.",

The Raid: Redemption has it all and more.Rama (Iko Uwais) is part of a SWAT team that raids the building of a very powerful drug lord that most cops wouldn't even think about bringing down. He knew the risks when he signed up, but yet he still chose to leave his pregnant wife at home and head out into the bloody unknown. The Raid: Redemption proposes a fairly straight-forward plot, yet it still tries to squeeze in a few expected turns to keep your thinking and enjoyment levels on the same page.",

            "content": "The Raid: Redemption is being called the best action film in years and one of the finest martial arts flicks in many a moon. I can certainly see why. The film is relentless and brutal in its depiction of wild, merciless carnage, with one goon after another being punched, kicked, stabbed, shot, or killed. Back in the thirties, things like this were considered outlandish. There is now an entire genre devoted to the same acts that were frowned upon many decades ago.I'm not a huge fan of modern action films. I consider many of them lousy, indistinct, generic, underdeveloped and sometimes, degrading and blatantly insulting to a generation. The Raid won me over for the first forty minutes with its scummy atmosphere and stylized sequences, but I grew weary of it all, and by the end, I felt my journey through this world of brutality could've ended twenty-five minutes earlier.The film occupies a skeleton of a plot, revolving around Rama (Uwais), a rookie member of an elite SWAT team. Deep in the Jakarta (the film is shot in Indonesia) slums, there is a decrepit, disgusting tenant occupied by the ruthless drug-lord Tama Riyandi (Sahetapy) on the thirtieth floor. The remainder of the tenant houses Rivandi's gang members, killers, druggies, and murderers. The place is so scummy and unjust that the police dare not even bother with it.The SWAT team of twenty men arrive at the break of dawn to raid the building and apprehend and kill everyone inside. The course of the film follows the SWAT team as they go floor by floor shooting, punching, and kicking their enemies until a bodies crowd the floors. This is a violent and dehumanizing exercise, but according to them, it must be done. The film as a whole is rigid and remorseless, and sadly, no character, even out main protagonist, is never developed at all. They are action figures in SWAT uniforms. That's how far the film goes.The film has the plot of a Nintendo Entertainment System game, and the look and feel of a Call of Duty extravaganza on Xbox 360. As far as the action goes, it's very coherent and stylistic. Coherency is my biggest complaint when it comes to modern action films. Many action films, take Taken and Transformers for example, have potential to be well done and very intriguing pictures, but what winds up happening is character development is swapped for fighting and coherency traded for jumbled, fast-moving sequences. The Raid: Redemption's stunts are hard to document, but never once was I lost in the shuffle. Everything was there and it was all projected in a coherent and consistent state. Something I must laud.But here's the prime complaint; the film violates one of my rules of action films. This is one of the things I knocked Taken for as well. If you have a man who can beat up x-number of guys on screen at one time, where is the suspense? If a person can apparently survive all attempted punches and kicks, and somehow dodge ones forthcoming and know every move their enemy is going to make, where does the fear that \"he'll slip or get captured\" come in? The Raid: Redemption has all the pieces together, but it lacks credible suspense and tension in its sequences.The martial arts genre hasn't been explored by me enough, and The Raid is an interesting first step. If I went by reviews online, I'd think I had witnessed a game-changer or even a masterpiece. Now here's where my job breeds contempt; do I recommend the film? This is one of those films where if you read the plot, you don't need anyone to tell if you will like it or not. You should know by hearing the words \"SWAT team,\" \"fighting,\" \"brutality,\" \"relentless,\" and \"violence.\" People will pay to see the film, and it is already receiving enthusiastic praise online. But my job is not to review the film from an audience perspective. My job is to give my opinion and say if I recommend it. To action fans, it will do its job and to them, it will be a strong, worthy picture. For me, it was thin and lacking in substance.Starring: Iko Uwais, Joe Taslim, and Donny Alamsyah.

It is a dynamic, unrelenting, violent onslaught of almost continuous action and stunts with gunfire, knives, machetes, and casual objects in a seemingly endless, protracted plethora of martial arts combat set-pieces. That is what it sets out to be, that is what it succeeds in being.Those on the prowl for depth, characterisation, plot, higher engagement of the synapses, look elsewhere. It doesn't have any of that stuff and doesn't cater for the gentler soul. It doesn't pretend to, aspire to, or give any impression on any level that it requires thought or intellectual effort from an audience or viewer in any way, shape or form.Is it any good at what it does? Oh yes, it is. Bone-crunching, eye-watering, mind-numbing, gruesome and nihilistic in both philosophy and execution. Breathtakingly choreographed, lightning-fast paced, visually eye-melting and sonically ear-pounding. What you see is what you get, and what you get is a stylistic barrage of blood, death, mayhem and bruising brutality.In addition, to any thick-eared and illiterate yahoo who cannot muster the modicum of brainpower required to even consider the possibility of reading subtitles (that being the case you probably won't be reading this anyway, but, hey...) don't worry. They don't really mean anything in the context of this film and you can easily get the gist from just watching the frames sprint by. The visuals mostly inform on the limited storyline, which is meaningless and dispensable by and large, so no one is going to have to strain a cell or risk a cerebrovascular accident by having to try and read some words. Turn the subs off and the difference it makes to the film is microcosmic.This movie should not be criticised for being what it is or for being what it is not. It is unpretentious and unapologetic to a fault. It just...is as it is. A completely electrifying no-brainer of action and...action.Downsides - the colour scheme is predominantly a displeasing washed-out combo of blues and greys, lifeless and terminally drab to the point of visual ennui. Likewise, some of the martial arts combat scenes go on so long that the moves seem to be repeated and it's like watching a continuous loop of the same thing over and over on occasions. Finally the complete lack of characterisation results in blanket non-investment in caring about any of the characters or what happens to them. The actors are also thoroughly charmless and wooden to a man.This is what it gives you. Action. No more. No less. If you're happy with that, you'll love it and it will thrill you.

            "content": "Deep inside one of Jakarta's slums lays an apartment block that is the base of one of Indonesia's most wanted gangsters, Tama Riyadi (Donny Alamsyah). After being a no go area for the Police for years, they plan a raid to take the gangsters out. Early one morning a 20 man SWAT team descend on the building with the aim of clearing it out once and for all. Amongst the team is rookie cop Rama (Iko Uwais) who has left his heavily pregnant wife at home that morning, possibly for the last time. The SWAT team slowly make their way through the building, taking prisoners as they go before they get to the 6th floor where they are discovered. Soon an army of drug dealers, criminals and gangsters is on top of the small team of Police and what began as a mission to clear the building turns into a battle for survival and escape.Id' been looking forward to this film for months, having heard great things from the countries in which it has already been released. I'd heard rumours that it was the best Action film in a long time and having now seen it I have to agree that it probably is. The action is frenetic and features five or six scenes which are equal to the Oldboy corridor scene. That is enough on its own to make a great film but there is also a fairly engaging story of deceit, courage and duty. The story takes a back seat for a lot of the film but there are some nice twists in there. What this film is really about is hitting people, repeatedly and in ever differing ways. Director Gareth Evans cleverly balances the action with several short rest bites in which the audience can regain their breath before throwing another superb fight scene at them.I've never been interested in Martial Arts films and cannot think of a single one I've ever seen. There's often a bit in some of my favourite Korean thrillers but it's usually just a small part of the film. I think this is the first proper Martial Arts film that I've actually seen. I was blown away by the fantastic choreography of the fight scenes. They were truly incredible. It was almost like watching a ballet. Admittedly a very violent ballet and one that is more exciting than most. I can't begin to imagine how much time must have gone into the choreography but the result is very impressive. As well as the fights looking good, they are also incredibly violent and generally don't shy away from showing the audience the gory details. It only took about five minutes before my girlfriend was unable to look at the screen for the first time and she hid behind my shoulder several more times after that. I turned away myself once.As well as the great choreography the film is also shot in a beautiful and stylish way that keeps the audience at the heart of the action all the way through. Gareth Evans looks to be a very talented film maker. He uses some nice arty camera angles and has the camera follow the action everywhere, from wide open spaces, through floors and even behind walls. Another area in which the film excelled was its soundtrack. The film has a thumping electro-drum & bass soundtrack which works really well with the on screen action. I was tapping my feet along the whole way through. The US soundtrack was produced by Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park but I don't know if that's the version we got here in the UK. Either way, the version I heard was excellent and made me want to buy the OST, something I rarely do.As much as I enjoyed the film, after an hour or so of great action I did start to feel as though it was getting a bit samey. There were still excellent set pieces left for the final third including an epic three way fight but I'd become a little bit bored by it. Despite this, I still enjoyed the film as a whole much more than most films I've seen this year. I had to laugh a couple of times at the amount of punishment some of the characters were taking before getting back up as though they'd been hit by a wet marshmallow. It was a little unrealistic but no more so than any action film. As you'd expect with a successful Asian film, the rights have already been sold for an American remake. Considering the film has very little dialogue and employs some of the best Martial Arts in the world I can't see how a remake will improve anything. It's just another excuse for lazy Americans to watch something without having to read and make sure there are plenty of white people on screen so it doesn't seem too foreign. It's ridiculous.Overall The Raid slightly failed to live up to my very high expectations but it is still better than 95% of Action Films out there. The choreography is beautiful and with a body count in the hundreds it certainly packed plenty of action into its 101 minutes. It's opened my eyes to Martial Arts but not made me want to see another similar film. The plot is fine but incidental but the action and soundtrack alone make the film one of the best in recent months.www.attheback.blogspot.com",

It is 'almost identical' occurs when watching The Raid on the big screen, most of the audience-do mention (shouts) \"wuanjengggg!\" Haha! Once was willing titled as 'Serbuan Maut' for domestic distribution is indeed thrusting action scenes that make the audience swore and more swearing! I watched The Fighter and Warrior which present the tightened the audience to watch the live alike battle martial arts fight. However, The Raid able to make more glaring eyes witnessed the martial action almost without pause.In contrast to Gareth Evans who had served in Merantau (2009), a film premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival is concocting all kinds of battles and fights, as well as presenting a gun battle. It is still promoting martial arts fighting action, but this time free use of sharp weapons (indeed anything!) and far more brutal than ever shown in Merantau.Enthusiasts of the genre of action films must have been familiar with all the style of similar films from around the world ever. American action films off course have a different style from European action films. Asian action movies, particularly Hong Kong, usually the most prominent because of the strong element of self-defense and always looked real on the big screen. Well we'll find a mix of all styles in film action film The Raid; action of an armed attack is felt America / Europe be continued with Asian martial arts fighting action. This produces a combined massive action scenes are very-very horrible! A background of Gareth Evans who was born in Wales - England but with childhood joy watching action films of Hong Kong production may partly explain the action formula presented in The Raid. Choreographed action scenes and cinematography Gareth arranged with Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhiyan for six months before the official start shooting generate an excellent visualization of action scenes.Among the action scenes that can make the audience breathless, The Raid slightly poor in terms of story. The story was only explaining the relationship between the main characters and tuck the twist which not too surprising (although not easily predictable). The story is a formula that has been common in genre films like; humble hero, raid, trap, crime boss watch dog who is hard to beat, twist the story, the truth / goodness still wins. It's OK. And Gareth has chosen to sell the actions.Performance of the actors in The Raid may be divided into two categories: the character role and the action role. Action role presented so dogged by Iko Uwais (Rama) and Donny Alamsyah (Andi). Joe Taslim (Jaka) who appears as the commander can also look fierce with a lot of improvisation from Judo. But the top champion of action should be pinned to Yayan Ruhiyan who plays Mad Dog a cold, a bit silly, but super fierce. My advice, never close your eyes when watching the 'threesome' scene of Mad Dog with Andi and Rama! Henky Solaiman was always able to steal the show though here only appears briefly as a father who is concerned about the safety of his son. But the audience will be mesmerized by the appearance of Ray Sahetapy who plays Tama, a local Mafia boss character who is very relaxed, but cold and cruel. Shown eating instant noodles in short pants when facing the caught intruders, Ray is able to make my skin crawl because it looks so real and it may be a representation / characterization of real local criminal boss! Gareth Evans once again finished the film with the ending 'open'. Although without a convinced story, one thing that can be obtained from The Raid is that in this world no man is pure good or bad.",

Even, from time to time, a little John Woo.However, Gareth Evans' film The Raid suffers from too much swedgin' (is this actually possible?), too little character development, and on top of that a plot that would make Dario Argento cringe. The Raid, in amongst all the brutality, maintains absolutely zero comic relief (an ineluctable necessity in such bone-crunching and bullet-flying scenarios), together with a narrative that is so childlike and derivative that one wonders just how short that pitch was. How this film has managed to enter the cinematic stratosphere is an indictment not just on an increasingly brain-dead youth who think of nothing of sitting through 90 minutes of (an all-male cast) grunting and beating seven bells out of one another, but on aggressive marketing campaigns, and blinkered movie critics who are clearly biased to what they consider to be promising first-time directors. There is, granted, promise in a couple of well-executed scenes (look no further than the shotgun lighting up the hallway, and some of the fight choreography) but it just drags on\u0085 and on\u0085 and on\u0085.The elements and dynamics that made films like Ong Bak and Assault on Precinct 13 work were presented half-heartedly (if at all) in Evans' The Raid rendering it torpid and tedious towards the final act. There was not enough interest in either the storyline or the characters.In its one-dimensional nature, The Raid kinda reminded me of the old 80s video game Kung-Fu where the hero, Tomas (!), has to scale five floors in order to recover his kidnapped spouse. At least here, in this brain-insultingly simple video game, at the end of each floor, our hero Tomas has a different monster to overcome before he can progress to the next floor. The Raid however has no such simplistic curiosities. Instead, it completely circumvents the brain altogether, and gives us just another clich\u00e9d bad-guy who at the end of the day probably just needs to get out more, and save us all the discomfort of having to sit through 90 minutes of well-choreographed tosh.[3 months later... watched it again, this time with a little super lemon haze, and cannot believe how good this film is! Awesome....! I take it all back... Awe....suuuuuummmm. 9/10]",

The movie is about the army team that 'raids' a gangster building and the action starts. Although quite a lot of things remained unclear, it can be totally ignored.

It's like a long video game cut scene.I re-watched it recently, hoping to get what the fuss was about. I couldn't remember anything about it except that it was entirely set in a building with gangsters versus a SWAT team. I couldn't remember any characters or situations, and that wasn't my memory's fault: there are none to remember.The movie does have a few moments of invigorating martial arts, but when you consider the movie is 99% action, that's not a good ratio. I am not someone who believes things like plot and characters are unnecessary in an action movie. They can compliment each other, as they do in kung-fu classics like \"Come Drink With Me\" and \"The Prodigal Son\". \"The Raid\" is just a confusing mess of punching, kicking, stabbing, bashing, smashing, hacking, slashing, shooting, falling, and explosions. In this mural of violence, not one thing differentiates itself from anything else, or gives you any reason to care.",

Gareth Evans makes you watch this gritty and brutal action movie, making you feel arrested with the film's plot and its execution. There are several films which not only grabs your attention from the first scene but also make knots in your stomach by the time movie comes to an end. This sure does sound like an interesting combination and it actually is. The film is not only recommended for those who crave mindless action movies and would see anything in the name of action, THE RAID offers a different kind of action and would surely entertain those who thought that action genre has gone lukewarm in the recent years. One has to mention the action choreography when talking of THE RAID and the credit goes to the respective people. IKO UWAIS is a magnificent person to watch on screen, he's got the right presence and delivers an okay performance but magnificent action sequences choreographed by him. His character is very interestingly drafted and he makes it an engrossing character study. The visuals were spectacular and the cinematography was good together with the rock music score adding more to the adrenaline rush the film provides. The only thing missing was a strong screenplay which would have added some additional strength to the movie but it goes fine along without it. I don't actually know the science behind how Gareth Evans shot the film capturing each individual movement of the action sequences with detail and precision, what i know and care about is that it's a solid movie which offers thrills and action that was missing from the cinema for a very long time.",

Colleagues and friends had been raving about it since release but for some reason I'd never found the window of opportunity to sit down and watch it. The positive reviews and rave comments I'd heard made me more than a little wary but I am pleased to say the film really does live up to the hype I've had poured at me about it.The story is pretty straight forwards - a team of SWAT police officers raid a no-go tower block in an attempt to take down a drug lord. However, their attempts at a secret and silent entry into the building are blown apart when a look out manages to escape and notify the gang that they are under siege. Thereafter ensues mayhem, blood, violence and general chaos the like of which I've never seen grace a movie screen before.The fight scenes in The Raid are simply outstanding. In fact, to use such an adjective is really beneath what the film-makers, martial artists and choreographers have put together. Fast, furious and lethal the actors engage almost every conceivable item as a weapon - fists, knifes, guns, machetes, furniture, a door frame, even a fridge! Both the balls-to- the-wall intensity and originality of the action sequences is what makes this film stand out and make other martial arts action movies seem pretty generic fare.The director and DoP make effective use of steadi- and handy-cam to give the audience a sense that they are not sitting outside of the action but are there, in the room, watching these men fight to the often brutal and vicious deaths. And the fight scenes are never ended with a single crushing blow - a knife to the neck is rendered doubly effective with several additional stabs to the chest.The Raid is not a deep, meaningful study of violence; nor is it a wordy exposition about the darker side of human nature. It has a basic premise and some efficient and effective characterisation (two subplots about a corrupt member of the team and another who is on board to try and persuade his corrupted brother to return to the fold) and that really is all you need from an all out action movie of this nature.The Raid is a thoroughly enjoyable watch - and an exhausting one at that! - and I'd go so far as to say that it has set a new bar in terms of martial arts action movies.",

The rest of the film may be a cinematic masterpiece but I doubt it.There is a high-rise building occupied by ruthless gangsters. There is an isolated 20-man team of SWAT officers in Kevlar helmets who assault the high rise and must clean it out, floor by floor. There is treachery, incompetence, torture, and blood. The entire world is turned into a Boschian hellscape.Here's the structure of the film. The gangsters have outfitted the building like a fortress, with surveillance cameras, microphones, speakers, spies, and barricades. The cops assault, their attack is blunted on floor one. They talk. Then they assault again until their attack is blunted on floor two. They talk. They make it to a battered room on floor three but find they are surrounded and must chop their way through the floor to get back to floor two and their comrades. Then once more unto the breach, dear friends, while gore splatters all over the place and bullets zip in extra slow motion out of a gun barrel through a door, and through the neck of one of the skirmishers.This received some very good reviews, as it should have for those who miss the action movies of the 1980s and would like them back -- only moreso.Pfui.",

I have been waiting a long time to sit down and really enjoy this movie with no distractions and today was the day. Wow.So my take on it: John Carpenter meets Ong Bak with the dirty dulcet tones similar to the Dust Brothers. Some of the most visceral and ingenious fight sequences I've ever seen; great choreography. But at the same time, the fighting is realistic not overly 'Hollywood' like normal. Everyone taking hits, getting muscle fatigue and ending up just scrappy because of this. The stamina of those actors and stunt men!The camera work was gritty and fast but not indecipherable with some great angles being utilised. Editing was also tight, with nothing overused or clich\u00e9'd. Acting and story had integrity, direction was fantastic, I felt tension throughout the movie, at no point did i get to relax! Even now writing this review i still feel it. Dialogue really has let down some good movies, especially recently, but The Raid had a great script from start to finish. It would have been a perfect 10 for me but i struggled with the Indonesian also, although I'm not sure if English would have been the answer....Cracking job well done Mr. Evans and with a relatively small budget! You have set the bar for many filmmakers. Including myself. It just goes to show that throwing millions at a script does not make the movie.Sai",

It's not quite the level of Transformers Dark of the Moon, but it is pretty intense.The martial arts and fight choreography are pretty good and you never doubt that any of the people (except maybe the old white-haired guy) would be able to hold their own in an actual fight. In short, fairly believable.I say fairly because at times the action just goes on TOO long. As with so many Asian martial arts flicks this one occasionally suffers from the \"indestructible fighters\" syndrome. Fights drag on for ages in some cases, far beyond what any person, even ridiculously fit ones, would be capable of sustaining.The whole thing has the ring of a video game. I'm not sure if it was intentional, or not. As an example, in the final battle, two fighters take on the main bad guy's henchman. The minute the scene was set for the fight I was thinking... \"Ah! Final boss fight!\" and I wasn't wrong.That fight went on for several loooong minutes. It actually became rather boring to watch, with repetitive moves and the aforementioned indestructible characters getting up again and again.At the end, when they finally beat the bad guy, my mind mentally overlaid an XBox-style achievement award, \"Defeated the Boss's right-hand man - 50G\".And that is the biggest problem with The Raid. There is little substance to the film other than combat and battles. There is little character development. All the imagination went into the fight sequences and it shows.It was also rather odd to realise that there appeared to be only two female characters in the film, both of whom are relegated to lying in beds and doing nothing for the duration of their very limited screen time.Anyway, it is worth watching for the fighting, if you like that sort of thing. Just don't expect much in the way of a deep plot or characterisations.",

The second time around left my mouth hanging again, this time because of the absolutely insane action scenes. About 75 percent of the action scenes had been cut down when I saw it in the theater, a worthless money-grabber. Now on DVD, I'm able to watch the uncut version with the original language, and I fully enjoyed the film.I was shocked to see the full blast of brutal action for the first time, and I would definitely recommend this to action junkies like my father. The fight scenes were beautifully choreographed and the stunts were amazing. I know now how hard it is to make a martial art action film, it requires actors with such skills and an excellent choreography, and it's hard to perfectly handle a scene with a lot of movements, it was amazing to see how the characters do their stuff, it's like dancing, it's a different kind of art, it should be appreciated. It takes time to master that kind of art.The violence of this film leaves me breathless, I was a big fan of Jet Li and his movies when I was younger, 5 years ago I would've rated this with a perfect ten. But overall, the film is completely reliant on its action, the plot wasn't a bit of a challenge nor was it a particularly good one. The weakness comes in the plot, I know when we watch action movies we don't really care about it, but it's equally important as the action, but I know this film aims to entertain, and it did succeed. In the end, it's just another karate movie, but it's one bar higher than the usual. The Raid: Redemption is a great piece of entertainment, though not destined to be a great film.

            "content": "Let me say up front that part of me still thinks I am selling this movie short by rating it a 7. Some aspects of it are just that good.To start with the good: it is one of the best martial arts/action movies I have seen in a long time. The action is fast-paced, with a raw, naturalistic feel you don't often see. There are a number of extremely well choreographed fight sequences that get the adrenalin flowing, and whatever they paid the stunt performers; it was nowhere near enough.The plot is lean and largely there to facilitate the action, and as such does its job well without stretching credibility. Characters react realistically and at no point do you wonder 'why on earth they did that' (while truthfully knowing that the story needed them to). There are a few twists, but they are pretty predictable.So why not an comfortable 9? In terms of the action, I tend to cringe at the sheer amount of punishment the main characters seem to be able to shake off (but that is true of many similar films). Also, the low quality of the CGI betrays the film's limited budget.Where the film struggles is when you try to view it as anything more than pure spectacle. The core scenario is to take a group of characters and put them into Jeopardy. Unfortunately, the film makes no attempt to get you to like or even know the characters before throwing them off the deep end. The police characters are pretty much interchangeable, and the villains for the most part faceless goons.Once the film moves past the initial set pieces, you do begin to get to know a little about the surviving characters, but it really is not enough to draw you into their plight. What is telling, is in one of the major set pieces I suddenly realised that one of the main heroes was going to get killed. The thoughts that hit me were: first pleasant surprise that the writers would do it, followed by sadness that I just couldn't care less. The fact that there are shades of Grey between the two sides, just make it harder to have any kind of emotional connection.I can see why the filmmakers made the decisions they did: keep the film short and get straight to the action. For me it just makes me feel the whole thing is superficial; essentially Style over substance. That said, the style is pretty spectacular and if you have any interest whatsoever in action or martial arts, you really need to watch this.",

The plot centres around an A S.W.A.T. team who become trapped in a tenement run by a ruthless mobster and his army of killers and thugs. It could have been a good Martial Arts film but for my money there were way to many guns and the violence was totally over the top. Is it really necessary to show people's heads and limbs blown off just because you can? As for the Martial Arts, these were also a disappointment. Fight scenes way to long and drawn out and made unrealistic by the level of violence and injury that didn't seem to affect the main characters at all. As for that funny little guy who took on two others, sorry he wasn't in the least bit convincing. The main reason this didn't work though was the main character had zero personality. What made the early martial Arts films work, especially Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan was that the main character had personality and you found yourself routing for them. Quite frankly I lost interest in all the characters in this film after 5 minutes of them being on screen.",

            "content": "You know you're having a good time when there is audience participation in a film with shouts of 'Hot him up!'; 'Box him down!'; 'Bang him up!'; 'He's a bad man!' and breathless cries and winces of 'ooh'; 'aah'; 'wow' finished off with thunderous rounds of applause and whoops of delight. Well, this was the experience I had with 'The Raid' last night and good fun it was too. Like all the best ideas, the plot is simplicity itself: a SWAT team is ordered to take out a gangland boss who has holed himself up in a 15 floor tenement block along with the worst criminals in the city which they all call home, the plan goes wrong and all hell breaks loose in an orgy of carnage (some involving white goods), bone breaking and bloodletting that is perfect Friday night post pub and pre-curry entertainment.Iko Uwais is a star in the making and has an impact equal to Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and Tony Jaa when they made their breakout films in 'The Big Boss', 'Drunken Master' and 'Ong Bak' respectively. A real practitioner of the Indonesian martial art of Pencak Silat, Uwais is a deadly whirlwind of flying feet, hands and elbows. Three standout scenes showcase his skills, but the best of them is the first when he is cornered by four dangerous goons in a narrow corridor and takes them out in an exhilarating blur of hand and feet co-ordination made all the more exciting by the daggers that appear to be stuck permanently to his gloves as lethal appendages. You genuinely won't have seen anything like it before, yet it's a derivative martial arts/action movie, but one that feels as fresh and inventive as the country it comes from and guaranteed to set your pulse and blood racing. The man responsible for this wondrous hit is Gareth Evans, a once innocuous Welshman, whom you suspect will have Hollywood and more specifically ageing actions stars like Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Willis and Statham beating a path to his door to replicate the successful formula with this calling card of a film. Of course, the Hollywood rights have already been bought up and this will surely be re-set in downtown L.A. with a bigger budget, more bang for the buck and hi-tech gadgetry ranging from laser targeting scopes to night vision goggles to the latest gunporn. Whether it will have the same terrific touches of the original, however, remains to be seen unless Evans is asked to direct the Hollywood remake. The illuminated silhouettes of deadly criminals on an upper floor waiting to ambush the SWAT team in the dark against the flash of gunfire, and the breathless tension created by a machete slicing into the cheek of our hero hiding behind a partition wall from searching goons linger long in the mind. Evan's overnight success is so remarkable that it can only appear in a Hollywood script or be true. A post graduate in script writing at the University of Glamorgan Evans met and married an Indonesian woman who used her contacts to get her husband a directing gig in her native Indonesia and so they moved to Jakarta. The directing job turned out to be a documentary on Indonesian martial arts which is where Evan met Uwais, who was a student at the Silat school, and together they made their first martial arts film called Merantau (Warrior) in 2009 which has since gone on to popular and critical success. Evans is now preparing to direct the sequel to 'The Raid' called Berandal (Thug) with presumably a bigger budget and a wider international audience to satisfy. If it's half as good as the original, I for one, cannot wait. Bigger challenges lie in wait for Evans the Director; namely whether he can turn Uwais into a genuine long-term action star with crossover appeal in the West (note the disappearance of Tony Jaa and his straight to video sequel of Ong Bak 3), and whether he can widen his brief as an action director. For now, though, I welcome the arrival of genuine new talents in Evans and Uwais and applaud the dizzy excitement of 'The Raid'.",

            "content": "Viewing films with big sources is expected at times- the press marketing methods, actions, film movie trailer, kind of take away all the suspense, shows plots and places objectives. Viewing relatively uncommon films however can often be a serendipitous journey- you never know when you might find out a concealed gem. And when you do so, no energy on the globe should stop you from getting information out, so here is my respect to the best action film in decades- The Raid: Payoff. Yes, there are bad aspects about this film but they are very minor and the way this film was taken creates you look finish that. I'll start with the adverse aspects. First of all, although the tale creates for a very punchy and easy one wide range idea, it does still handle to be needlessly upsetting and has aspects that it contains in with amazingly unpleasant editions. Rama having an personal interest in the purpose is just announced without much in the way of information is one example but so are other tale gadgets. This is a film where preparing isn't perhaps the most important aspect, but this should have developed the job easier and make these complicated aspects all the more annoying. Films like Die Difficult and others have used near atmosphere to really improve the stress outside of the action series, but here I don't think Evans really controls to do it. The battling choreography was also like nothing I've ever seen before. The Indonesian design of Pencak Silat was amazing and amazing to look at, and the complexness of some of the more amazing fights was usually jaw dropping. Although these flaws there, the man responsible for this fantastic hit is Gareth Evans, a once easy Welshman, whom you believe will have Expert and more particularly ageing actions superstars like Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Willis and Statham beating a direction to his use of copy the efficient program with this company of a film. The illuminated silhouettes of risky criminals on an greater floor having out to delay the SWAT team in the dark against the show of gunfire, and the worn out stress developed by a machete reducing into the experience of our idol covering behind a partition surfaces from looking goons remain lengthy in the brain. Main idol, Rama, conducted by the very certified Iko Uwais, comes across as an everyman, just like Tony Jha or Jackie Chan. We see that he is more like a knowledgeable person generally trying to remain existing than a incredibly fanatic or one man army. This increases the stress in many minutes, as we truly think these numbers, each of the fantastic individuals, are in real danger. And there are enough stress packed minutes to put you on the benefits of your seat. The camera-work, modifying, and cinematography do their factor to improve an already imaginatively eye-catching film. While some films go the route of not efficient camcorders and quick reduces, The Raid doesn't secure up anything. It doesn't just improve the bar; it stabs the bar in the neck and contains it out of a show. It will hit you away and keep you looking for more. Luckily, we have two sequels in the features, but I really can't think about creating a better action film.",

            "content": "\"The Raid\" (that awful, curious US-imposed add-on \"Redemption\" tag not withstanding) wears its genre black belt extremely close to its mean little bullet-proof vest. The subtitled-line readings in the film's brief dialogue plot bursts reach to tip-off audiences that this might not be your standard Hollywood action-film by-product.Don't worry. It is. \"The Raid\" is Indonesian-style ersatz Hollywood punk-junk; a will-be cult film that wears a solemn, straight face as it blood lets over the course of a zippy 100 minutes. It's a modern-day version of those cheapy Roger Corman Philippine prison pictures minus Pam Grier and the rag-tag social commentary.\"The Raid\" wastes little time in establishing its own trademarked violent spirit and kinetic tone, which owes plenty to Howard Hawks' \"Rio Bravo\" as much as it does to latter-day auteur offerings like John Carpenter's \"Assault on Precinct 13\", Walter Hill's \"The Warriors\" and even the Robert Zemeckis/Bob Gale-screenplay for the forgotten 1992 thriller, \"Trespass\".Like any good genre picture, it judiciously picks at the bones of past story structures and well-hewn cinematic inspiration to make something that is both broadly derivative and narrowly it's own.The overall film is exceedingly well-shot and tightly edited, and manages to create a very tense plot escalation through several ingenious escape set-pieces in its early goings. If this frantic, economically-scripted, and low-budget action film can best be qualified, it is most certainly a bloody, aggressive calling card for \"The Raid's\" director. Hollywood, meet Gareth Evans.The plot, such as it is, forms a very simple skeleton for what is essentially a brutal haunted-house-meets-video-game story. An elite special-forces team is involved in a covert mission involving the extraction of a brutal crime lord from a rundown fifteen-story apartment block. But when their cover is blown (to bits), the Godfather offers lifelong sanctuary to every killer, rapist and thief in the building in exchange for the elimination of the police \"infestation\". As the police team snakes its way through every floor and every room to complete the mission, they face attack by fist, foot, firepower and double-crosses by the score.Though exciting for a good spell of the running time, after a smart set-up the film shifts into one long, punishing fight sequence punctured only by set changes. Once the feral hand-to-hand fight choreography kicks in during the mid-section of \"The Raid\", it's hard not to be dazzled by the vicious, over-the-top chop-socky of characters good and bad as they pummel, shoot, strangle, gouge, slice, stab and blow-up pretty much anyone who comes in their way.As brilliant and vital as every punch taken and received appears on-screen, its pulse-racing relentlessness pushes \"The Raid\" out of the frame of a muscular foreign b-movie update into what could generously be viewed as a series of endless levels in a particularly violent first-person-shooter Playstation game.Experiencing \"The Raid\" was akin to watching a gamer friend play through a violent Xbox title while you sit off to the side, looking on: engaging fun at first to see the sheer onslaught of challengers and challenges to take on, but empty thrills soon transcending into one long mind-numbing parlance for dizzy action.The film keeps piling on the fight scenes with villains for the heroes to cut down, one after another, that this viewer ultimately became thoroughly desensitized to the stylized, hyper-realistic violence on show. At several points, the movie plummets into plain, perhaps ironically intentional, overkill so punishing that the fancy of Evans' perpetual motion machine occasionally verges on oppressively tiring.Fault or no fault, the movie refuses to trade breathlessness for times where we as viewers might just need just a bit of a break from the killing and maiming. Just like that video game - as the movie soldiers on: \"The Raid\" segues to an aggressive, exhausting blur of blood and brutality, with interchangeable good and bad guys \u2013 but not one character that you truly care about. Sketches of stock traits and generic plot mechanics stand in for identifiable personas. Aside from a corker end of second-act turn, fleshed-out character development takes a backseat to seat-of-pants carnage. It's a stylistic choice that the director is doggedly consistent with throughout the film's running time.Having said that, the fisticuffs, kicks and gruesome carnage is so imaginative and balletic it sometimes reaches the level of intricate Gene Kelly-dance patterns crossed with John Woo-meets-Stephen Chow anarchic ultraviolence. There is energy to burn in the staging, and the film benefits highly from director Evans' assured construction technique.The film's one technical snafu is that the spare and intentionally-monotonous production design leaves the viewer scrambling to figure out the marked progression of our heroes' quest up through the building \u2013 leaving punch-drunk audiences to guess how close or how far the protagonists are from realizing their bruised and beaten finish line.This is not to say that this tense and scrappy film is not without its merits. The below the line aspects of this film are peerless. With a budget of just over a million dollars, \"The Raid\" is a miracle of low-fi genre filmmaking that shames bloated, multi-million dollar studio action pictures of this or any other year with its vital camera-work, casting and furious energy.Director/editor Evans has got a great eye and an impeccable sense of timing which keeps his film moving at a literal break-neck speed. His storytelling skills are selectively spare and in deference of \"The Raid's\" action and thrills trajectory as a B-movie time-filler should be. Surely Evans is now on every Studio Head's must-hire helmer list for bigger movie franchises in the not-to-distant future.\"The Raid\" is a standard man-on-a-mission action thriller wrapped into a primal, shamelessly gritty, comic book simple exercise in style over substance. Exceedingly well-mounted and gore-ously realized, the movie as a whole is both aggressively imposing and as pointedly vacant as the building its fictional warlords prevail.",

This movie gets about 1000x more badass once they put down the weapons and do some hardcore martial arts, and it's even better when they manage to fit in some swordfighting sequences. I'd watch way more action movies if they all featured sword fights. But I've gotten some stick in the past for not liking action movies, and the reason I don't is because most of the time they feature two dudes standing on each side of the room firing boring bits of metal at each other until one of them falls down. Hell, that was the main problem that I had with the Dredd movie last year. The Raid shows how to make an action movie that I actually like because the action is actually entertaining.And that's like, it by the way. The action is the sole reason to watch this movie. I mean the acting is great in the sense that people react to getting punched in the face pretty well, and the story is good in that it doesn't totally fall apart at any point. But let's face it, the action is what brings The Raid to people's attention, including mine, and the director knows that. Although, as I say, the movie gets way better once the characters put down the guns, it's still a lot of fun until that point, it's just not as much fun. Seriously though, I refuse to believe anyone can show me a better fight scene than the invasion of the meth lab about sixty minutes into this. Seriously, I actually dare you.So this movie's awesome. 100 minutes flies by and it gets even better on rewatch when you realise you really don't have to be paying attention to the plot outside of the basic premise. Although the occasional emotional moment is dampened slightly by not knowing the context, I honestly think no-one who watches this film will care. So yeah, everyone can keep their \"just a proper action movie\" films and next time I want to chill out with beer and pizza and watch people fight each other for some reason or another I'm gonna put on this slice of badassness.",

Before I watched this movie my fav action movie of all time was Die Hard, how could it not be right? Well this movie obliterates that one. What's weird is the story is somewhat similar, and I will admit Die Hard is much funnier, but that's all it has on the Raid.There was a tag line I seen about this movie that said '3 minute love story and 90 minutes of action' well that is super accurate. The movie does not stop. It has the best fight sequences I have ever seen, except for possibly the sequel, but I'll mention that in my Raid 2 review. The choreography is insane and once I found out who was apart of the choreography it all made sense, Rama and Mad Dog, 2 of the leads, worked on the fight sequences. Any fight scene in this film could easily be the best fight scene of all time, I can't even pick a favourite. It looks so realistic its crazy.The one thing some people may complain about it is there is no character building, which is technically true. Even though that's true mark my words you care if Rama survives. There's something about the actor that makes you care even though you don't know him all that well. You know he's kind, heroic and actually has a purpose being in that building. Subtitles is a none issue because there is not a whole lot of talking. If you like action or martial arts you need to watch this movie. I've seen it more times than any other movie in the last year. It's an easy watch and you will not want it to end. Relentless is the best word I can think of to describe this action masterpiece.",

I liked better Yayan Ruhian who's mad performance, both physical and emotional, make you - almost - forget he has a raving psychopath role. Enough praises, let's get to the critique! First, no SWAT team will simply swarm a 15 tall building without prior information about their target and defenses. Second, no human will ever suffer this type of punishment - see Iko and Yayan non stop fighting - and keep going through so many enemies or fights. Third, Silat look good, but is one energy consuming hog. To many fast moving hand and feet techniques in a situation you'll need to save every ounch of energy to escape. Fourth, why don't use the bad guy clothes, I mean there must be at least 100 hundred there, try to blend in. Fifth, you attack a mafia stronghold with machine guns and guns only!!? Really!All in all, is a good ''car'' for showing Silat, more effective that Hollywood did with MMA and on par with Muay Thai movies who are somewhat realistic, mostly ... Still, if you are really interested in taking Silat classes, complement them with grappling and avoid dangerous situations. Wounds in movie are fake, your real life injuries hurt a lot!",

            "content": "The Raid: Redemption has been touted as the \"best action film in years.\" This Indonesian flick has amassed quite a bit of buzz since being unveiled at the Toronto International Film Festival late last year. Due to its success, there has not only been an announcement of turning the film into the first part of a trilogy, but there will also be an American remake. With its gradual release into American theaters, we can now finally feast our eyes on The Raid: Redemption and determine whether it's a franchise worth investing in or just another throwaway foreign martial arts film.Gareth Evans' The Raid: Redemption revolves around a young cop named Rama who along with the rest of his police tactical unit are sent in to bring down a crime lord hiding away in his headquarters in the slums of Jakarta.The tagline on the American poster is \"1 Ruthless Crime Lord. 20 Elite Cops. 30 Floors of Chaos.\" This is greatly misleading. Sure, there is a \"ruthless crime lord,\" but it is said in the opening of the film that the tactical unit is full of inexperienced cops including the main character, Rama, who is referenced as a rookie. 30 floors of chaos? Taka, the crime lord, is stationed on the 15th floor and most of the action takes place within the first seven.Minor gripes about the tactics of marketing aside, martial arts films generally place storytelling in the backseat and place the action at front and center. Because of this, there is no reason for me to intensively judge the narrative of The Raid. It is just a means to get from fight scene A to fight scene B. Fortunately, the film gives just enough background in the first few minutes to make Rama into a man the audience can root for and Taka into a man the audience wants to see brought down. There are a few twists in the narrative but they are telegraphed from miles away. Though it has some substance, the story strives to be nothing more than the minimum.What The Raid lacks in story it more than makes up in action sequences. This is the draw of the film and it delivers. There is some gunplay in the early moments of the film, but as both sides gradually run out of ammo, the action goes to hand-to-hand combat and melee weapons. The fighting in the film is done through the Indonesian martial art of Pencak Silat. Honestly, being that I have little-to-no knowledge on various fight styles, Pencak Silat looks no different to me than any other martial art used in action films. It has a blistering pace and allows for Rama to take on multiple adversaries at once. Obviously, there are moments where it is required a suspension of disbelief such as when a character has their head repeatedly smashed into a concrete wall and still has the wherewithal to fight back. At the end of it all, we are watching \"superhuman\" action in a real world setting. It looks cool and that is all that really matters.The major problems I have with the film stem from the technical side of things. The hand-held cinematography works throughout most of The Raid as it helps to add to the tension of the siege. Where it falters is when Evans decides to follow the combat too closely and/or moves the camera too much during action sequences. This is a common problem that has existed in action films since the Bourne series and Batman Begins. Dizzyingly fast camera moves and edits during action sequences tend to disorient the audience and bring on near-nausea. The Raid is not the worst culprit of this, but it does add a level of annoyance, at least for me.The other area is in the use of CG. There aren't a great number of instances, but the few times the film uses CG it comes off looking cheap. I understand that the film is foreign and therefore probably had a lower production budget, but I can't help but think they could have used practical effects for sequences such as crashing through windows. As I said, the instances are few so it doesn't detract as much from the film as the cinematography does.The Raid: Redemption ultimately fails to live up to the hype that preceded it. Solid martial arts film? Yes. Best action film in decades? Not even close. The real question is whether I would invest more time into this series. I don't foresee myself lining up for a sequel, but if Gareth Evans can take what he learned from this film and add better storytelling then I might be in.For fans of martial arts and action flicks or people who are curious about Indonesian films, this one is definitely worth a watch. Otherwise, I don't know if I could give a whole-hearted endorsement. There are a few great action sequences but little else that I would consider memorable.Written by: Jordan Wade @ http://ultness.com/",

That's the main focus of the film: adrenaline everything up with bloody scenes. The story is simple: the police department got an order to raid a drugged community. But not just that. This building is a center of druggies, Kong-Fu fighters, and the raid has been trapped into a point of no turning back, literally.Let's say, this film pushed the envelope to the limit, physical limit I'd say. Not that much to talk about on the plot, just like those Crank or Saw alikes. The design of the fighting scenes are the most charming part. Try to imagine Jacky Chen style with real blood and crossing out those intentional funny plots (if those do make you laugh. I didn't). You get The Raid.This is not me saying the film is bad. It is exceptionally good. And Ikno Uwais is our new hero. You can't get enough of his majestic moves of Close Quarters Combat.If you look closer to the progression of the movie, you can see they did arrange the raid like the army invading an opposite camp. When the raid was trapped in the building, you have Resident Evil scene, or The Walking Dead if the former reference is old. Those residents motivated by Indonesian Al Capone are acting exactly like zombies. The bloody Jacky-Chen-goes-serious part is up next, which the fighting part is legendary. Led and designed by Ikno Uwais, he is the fight choreographer of the movie. The seamless fighting scenes may be a little bit bloody for the mainstream demography, but that is so essential to the movie itself.Beautifully and bloodily crafted.",

Intense.When you watch Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhian (Mad Dog) fight, you will realize how much more realistic and admirable their choreography is, as compared to the likes of Jackie Chan and Jet Li.If there's an area which I wished the movie had explored, it would be the character development. While the portrayal of Tama by Ray Sahetapy was adequate in showing his scarily-cool-but-sadistic appetite for brutality, the director failed or chose not to explore the depth of other characters such as Rama, Andi and Jaka. Iko Uwais, despite being new to the acting craft, has the potential to give more. During one of the twist in the movie, the director could have let him show more emotion as a man-in-conflict. The audience would have felt more for the characters -- thus giving the movie a more meaningful substance and an emotional experience for the audience.I heard that there might be a Hollywood remake... I dread this. Would rather it remain like cult- like movie than an over-commercialized one, bastardized with over-the-top ridiculous choreography of fight scenes.",

Cops are in a Swat van to RAID an apartment block that is being run by a gangster, small briefing explaining they need to take the boss down and seize control of the building.3. RAID begins cops get battered 4. The remaining cops have to try and escape the apartment block including our main character.5. Lots of fight scenes 6. Small character twist 7. Lots of fight scenes 8. Small bit of exposition on reasons for the RAID 9. Tough guy end fight 10. Final exposition on reason for RAID You could probably write the dialect and plot down on 3 pages.The good points are that the action and cinematography are truly top notch, it has a very gritty and real feel even though many of the fight scenes are highly unrealistic they are not cartoony.There are some very unique action scenes that really grab your attention but the best ones happen early on in the film. After that it just more of the same so gets repetitive.With little else within the plot to grab your attention the film then gets boring and your counting down the time till it ends.For pure action fans this could probably get an 8 or 9 but with little else to carry it the average movie goer will just get bored.I would probably have given it a 5 but I'll give it a 6 as there was a lot of very good bits to this film, if you took these good bits and put them in a better film they would really stand out as not only being great action scenes but also works of art.Action fans will love it, everyone else will find it OK",

Ever since then I've been meaning to get around to seeing it (and its sequel) and finally managed to tonight. I would say I was impressed, but not blown away. The film is absolutely non-stop action from the word go. There is zero let up from start to finish - but is that a good thing? I felt like the film never slowed down enough to allow itself to have a soul. What I mean by that is films with incredible pacing like 'The Dark Knight' (if you ever need 2 and a half hours to feel like 15 minutes, that's the film to go with) still manage to take the time to be thought-provoking. Now, 'The Raid: Redemption' is far from mindless and has some twists and turns along the way, but it never made me actually go into a deeper level of thinking on anything. This is what hinders it from being up there with the truly great films.There's a lot of of fun to had with this movie nonetheless. Some of the fight sequences are quite astonishing. I don't think the claustrophobic feel of the building was up to the same standard that 'Dredd' managed to create it to, though perhaps that was simply because this building had windows? There's certainly a lot to like here, and while it's far from perfect, I very much look forward to seeing what they managed to achieve with a bigger budget in the sequel.",

We follow a SWAT team who raid an apartment block in order to capture Pa-Pa, but the Pa-Pa clan aren't going to make it easy...(ok fine, no more Dredd references). One minute in and our main character is punching, elbowing and kicking a sand bag at 100mph. Bam! I was ready to sit back and watch a heck load of hand combat unfold. 40 minutes later, still no hand combat scenes...I was growing agitated. Thankfully though, the film turned around and our main character was battling his way through using only his body and knives. I'm talking full annihilation. Complete decimation. The residents did not stand a chance! Wham! Bam! Kapow! Swish! Slice! Followed by continuous noises as our characters fights to death. \"Ah! Ehh! Phwoarrr! Hai! Ohhh!\"...you get the gist. The action is pretty relentless, well executed and rapid. The choreography is insane. INSANE! There is one scene where two good guys are against one bad guy (apologies for the bland description) that goes on for six minutes. I have never seen so much flipping, kicks to the head, jump punches and head smashes to the floor...in my life. The bad guy in that scene is like the Indonesian Terminator, he just wouldn't die. The directing was good overall, not many quick cuts although the camera was particularly shaky during the first half. My problems with the film are with the plot conveniences and predictability. I don't really want to dive into it for spoiler reasons but if our main character is in a tricky situation, something would always happen to get him out. Any \"twists\" that were executed, were predictable and poorly constructed. Also some fight scenes in rooms have all the furniture right next to the walls, therefore leaving a massive open space for the fight. I would like to have seen them use the furniture to their advantage. Plus, I literally just watched it and don't know the main character's name. At all. Greatest action movie ever? No, but it's good!",

The story is pretty basic but there are a lot of Hollywood films out there with far less script detail.Overall, this is a great film enjoyed by critics and the public alike.

I sat down to watch it with my brother, expecting yet another of these boring foreign films with a lack of thrill and shoddy fight scenes and shoot outs - but oh boy I was wrong! Now if you were to watch this film, the first thing you may think is that they aren't speaking English.. this is correct, as the whole film in fact is in Indonesian, and subtitled with English. Now unless you speak fluent Indonesian, then you may find it a difficult task to criticise the quality of the acting just as me and my brother did. However, in a way I saw this as a good thing.. with a film SO action packed, it means you can spend less time focused on the acting and more time focused on the ambitious stunts and intricate fight scenes. Therefore, this moves me on to the next point, the stunt director did a seriously, seriously, seriously good job. It's so realistic! Fights aren't all just a '1-2' punch combo followed by being catapulted through a window, and slow motion explosions.. it genuinely seems like they are trying to kill each other! Now admittedly, action isn't the only criteria for a good film.. but The Raid is a GREAT film, it has the perfect balance of ups and downs, and a brilliant plot which makes the 2 hours of Indonesian speaking, breath taking, edge of your seat action worth not only the watch, but also the 4 awards it won.",

All I had heard about it was the awesome action.And that's what I got: a simple plot and awesome action.The story is of a group of police officers tasked with taking a high rise from a drug lord, and they have to fight their way up and then back down. Their plan to sneak up gets shot, and action takes over. Bullets quickly run out, and everyone rips out their martial arts skills (which are surprisingly uniform). It's thin, but fun, much like John Wick, which is also built on a simple premise and then delivers well-executed action for its relatively short running time.I enjoyed what I got, but it felt like the steps necessary to make the movie better would have been easy enough to take. There are a pair of brothers on both sides, one police officer and the other a lieutenant to the drug lord, but the mere existence of the relationship isn't revealed until about halfway through the movie and even then, the dialogue leaves the audience guessing for a good part of the conversation what is actually going on. There's also an information dump towards the end about the nefarious reasons that the police lieutenant took the officers in without telling anyone else about it. It's not that the reasons themselves are poor (they make a good bit of sense), it's that it all comes out in the last five minutes. We've known that the police lieutenant is bad news for a while, which is really all we need, so if the actual reasons are going to come out, don't end your pulse-pounding action movie with two people talking about it for several minutes at the end.I wrote more about my problems with the movie than what I liked, but that's because what I liked was really simple and most of the movie, and what I didn't just required a bit more explanation. The movie really is quite a bit of fun. It's grungy and rather brutal in its violence, and the chaos is very well managed from beginning to end. I just wish that the plot outside the main action (the lieutenant's nefarious reasons) had been handled more evenly and that the brothers stuff had been more central to the actual story and, again, handled more evenly.",

The fights are, generally, good enough to carry the picture single-handedly. They're intense and climactic, from the manic four-on-one rumble that kicks off the pandemonium to the nigh-invincible boss battle that concludes it. There's a jarring sense of harsh finality to The Raid, with a steady stream of weaponry in play and every duel culminating in a killing or crippling blow. There's no limping off, bruised ribs in-hand, to fight another day... these guys are visibly finished.In lieu of a deeper, less generic plot, it's that brutal efficiency which gives the film its identity. In six months' time, when I reflect on this film, that's what I'll remember.

(the protector in US and tom yung goong in Asia) i didn't like the story in warrior king, i found it boring and badly structured. the fighting on the other hand, was bloody fantastic. there is a lot more variety in this, more fun to be had, and warrior king did do some great camera work (the 4 and half minute one take of Jaa ascending the stairs while kicking heads was very well done) and to be honest, it felt more brutal that The Raid.There's a lot less blood of course, but there's more pain to be felt in Warrior King, cause when someone gets hurt, you really feel it. in The Raid, you feel the pain, but a lot less often.overall its not very good, over hyped and very repetitive. i wont talk about the characters because they're just cardboard cut outs that kick things. i really think this could have been a better film if they just put more time into making characters and a good story, and not a couple of ways of creatively killing someone. or just more variety, then i may become interested.",

I have walked out of 3 movies in my life. This is the 3rd.If you love non-stop action, little dialog and a plot that does not really matter, this movie is for you. If you need a plot to justify the violence, this is NOT a movie for you. I heard from my friends who stuck it out that I missed 2 pretty awesome martial arts sequences, and I was disappointed about that. But the constant (and I do mean constant - balls to the wall- one killing spree to the next with virtually no interlude) explicit and no holds barred violence was too much for this viewer.",

At one stage you see 2 main characters fighting mad dog. At a rough guess they should've broken his legs, arms and several other limbs around 20 times... each! But he kept getting back up. This was a little too much for me.I couldn't help but think they put a plot in after finding a lot of martial artists wanting to make a movie about beating each other several shades of blue.Overall very disappointed, don't waste your money unless you like movies such as the house of flying daggers.

When the raid does not go as planned, the surviving officers must fight to stay alive and try to escape from deep within enemy territory. Writer/Director Gareth Evans does a great job of providing us with numerous action scenes of ballistic intensity. Whether it's machine guns or knives or when things go hand to hand, we get treated to some crazy and kinetic action that's back to basics, balls to the wall, kick ass style. No John Woo glossiness here (Not that there's anything wrong with that. Love JohnWoo). It's just blood soaked and tooth and nail. It's like a Shaw Borthers movie on crack...and lots of it. The Indonesian fighting style adds a uniqueness to the fights and Evans' camera captures all the rapid fire moves of his martial arts savvy cast. And best of all, Evans also knows to back up his action with some good suspense, some strong drama and a few nice plot twists along the way. He also knows to let us catch our breath now and then so we are ready and waiting for the next life and death struggle. And we get plenty of those. Sure there are some flaws and it is vicious and brutally violent but, it also is an entertaining and exhilarating action crime thriller.",

            "content": "Isn't it great when a film can actually keep pace with the hype machine built around it? Welshman Garth Evans' The Raid is an almost impossibly efficient action film, a no-nonsense juggernaut of lightning-quick martial arts and extreme violence. Appealing so eagerly to our basic sense of gratification, this is very much the bounding, confident actioner that genre fans have been starved of.Entrenched in Jakarta's slum district is a desolate apartment complex, which has become a hideaway for the city's most repellent and dangerous criminals. At the top floor, crime lord Tama operates a drug lab, dutily protected by thirty floors of violent psychopaths. Early one morning, a 20-man SWAT team, including rookie Rama initiates a raid, sweeping from floor-to-floor, with the single aim of eliminating Tama and his crime empire once and for all.While opening action is characterised by relentless gunfire, the more exhilarating moments come once the ammo is expended, and Rama and his team resort to unbelievable hand-to-hand combat. Stunt choreography is elegantly brutal, such that one wonders how nobody suffered serious injuries as a result, and enough \"extras\" \u2013 ranging from fridges, to chairs, tables, broken door frames, and banisters \u2013 are employed such that the sparring never becomes repetitive or tiresome. Those trying to keep up with the body count, meanwhile, will probably lose track before act one is over.In terms of achieving their goals, few films succeed as unqualified and as efficiently as this. It might seem to aim low, but Evans directs traffic with such deftness that the film reconfigures itself as a bursting, even beautifully violent piece of super-charged entertainment. Possibly the best John Woo film that John Woo never made, The Raid is a skull-splintering slice of wish fulfillment.",

Every one of them has heavy guns except the ones that inscrutably bring machetes to a gun fight.Every bad guy is beaten to total pulp only to leap up again and continue fighting, the hero seems to think that every fight needs to be prolonged to the max, and he never EVER runs out of stamina. Falling 3 stories from a window and landing on his back is a mere inconvenience to him.I'm amazed that this trash was recommended by martial artist friends who thought I might enjoy it, and I'm insulted that the director put this utter crap out.EVERY single character behaves with pathetic illogic, at every opportunity making the choice that is least likely to accomplish their supposed goals.A pathetic movie.

The protagonist is Rama (Iko Uwais) a relatable rookie with a pregnant wife and is also looking for someone else in the tenement at the same time. If you are looking for a non stop action film, look no further because this film will make your jaw drop! The choreograph and the stunt work are so groundbreaking it makes Jackie Chan and Chuck Noris look like Care Bear stuff. Iko Uwais, Yayan Ruhian, Joe Taslim and Donny Alamsyah are like the new Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan. I know Iko Uwais name in the movie is Rama but I call him the lord he is so badass!! But with all seriousness its not just the phenomenal action in the film that makes it great its also the incredible Directing by Gareth Evans, the suspense and the look is so well done. The writing something that not a lot of people talk about, I know its subtitled cause its Indonesian but there are some many great lines in this, it kinda reminded me of Quentin Tarantino stuff actually its really that good. Also the acting is really, really well done the guys are not just great for kicking ass, they also give sold performances. Even if I can't understand it and need subtitles I can still notice how good it is.

It's a magnificent display of the art of stunt work and stunt performers, with some of the best hand to hand combat on screen I've seen.I usually dissect the plot of characters a little when reviewing a film, but with The Raid that's not really possible or necessary. Only one character gets any real 'development, which is rather flimsy and not particularly needed in all honesty. The plot is very simple, and exists purely to facilitate the outrageous and gritty action that runs through the film.The action is the selling point for this film, and it really is stellar. The initial gun focused action is quickly swapped for close quarters martial arts, producing some thoroughly violent encounters as you'd expect. The stunt team really do excel in this film, and the camera work does an excellent job of following the flailing fist and legs around the tight corridors of the apartment block, augmenting the sense of danger. My only criticism would be that by the final fight I was getting ever so slightly bored of the fighting. Overall I think the balance was good, but had the action continued for another fight or two I would have started to lose patience with it a tad.The Raid really is a marvellous display of martial arts and the craft of stunt work, and celebrates this work in triumphant fashion. It fails to garner a higher score simply because of the lack of plot or character development, but the action really is second to none and will most definitely entertain you for a couple of hours!",

It drags on and on. You have 3 people constantly giving each other blows that would probably knock them out in real life, only for them to just keep on fighting. Not to mention, by this point in the film, all three characters are badly beaten down and tired already. I would've given this movie an 8.5 if it weren't for this fight scene.Story-wise...it's actually kind of interesting and complex.

I heard that it had a fairly well developed story, relative to its genre.For the quality of martial arts techniques exhibited, I'd say it meets expectations.For story, it starts off strong. Unfortunately, it finishes a little out of breath.I really enjoy the lead actor in this movie. I've seen a few of his movies, but Merantau is still his best overall film. As a rule, with his movies, they do tend to have a bit more under the skin than most martial arts flicks.Where this movie succeeds is in the level of suspense and dread that it creates for the protagonists, early on. It accomplishes this in a very simple and direct manner. I wish the creator of this movie could have kept that momentum all the way to the end.Another area of success is within the display of skill in the fighting segments. There aren't a lot of quick sequence editing tricks. We get to see these techniques play out in somewhat long takes. There's a lot of skill shown here, and the care in presenting it.Where the movie fails is a hard drop in tension and realism. At some point, probably after the first ambush on the SWAT team, the tension leaves the movie and doesn't come back. The realism leaves shortly after. I can't speak much to why it loses tension. It just does. The realism is a lot easier to point out. One of the most common flaws in martial arts, or fighting films in general, is the characters seeming to be indestructible. This movie loses its spark from this flaw in a big way. Most of the fights are quick. Two guys face off. There's a few well choreographed exchanges. One dies. One moves on. The elongated fights, with the main antagonist fighter to be specific, are so long and unreal that they become boring. I know the creator wants to showcase the skill, but its at the cost of any sense of harm to either fighter. At one point, a character is hung from a chain and punched on as if he were a heavy bag. He gets released only to get up and begin fighting as if he were fresh and unharmed. In the same climatic scene, there's a two on one fight with the one being horribly outsized, yet he is able to overcome a size disadvantage and a numbers disadvantage. He even continues to fight at a high level after he has been stabbed in the throat. At some point, taking bodily abuse has to mean something for these fight sequences to carry weight. I wish martial arts movies would figure this out going forward. Some realism would go a long way.The Raid was certainly a fun watch, but its not the best martial arts film out there.",

Great sequences, but cringeworthy acting and a story so bad it almost seems on purpose. I was afraid this movie was going to turn out like that. Well, it didn't. The flimsy story serves to set up non-stop action and it does the job well. There's tension from start to finish and you actually start to feel for the characters involved. When they got angry or hurt, you believe it's true. And this really helps lift the movie to a higher level. Because even great fight sequences need a reason to exist and this movie has enough heart to give it the intensity it needs. You'll actually feel as drained as the actors look after finishing this. That's because every bullet, every kick, punch and slice of the knife hit home. And in rapid succession of one another. The fights are choreographed in a realistic, gritty but exciting way. No shaky cam or fancy cuts. The Raid doesn't shows it all, without indulging itself. The camera work is great, the music is good, the action is fantastic and the acting and story is good enough to make it all come together. If you want to see ass kicking at it's finest, see this.

In a genre full of niche subgenres it was hard for me to find that one movie that was impressive throughout. While some seventies historical martial arts films have good fight scenes, the majority were garbage movies. Jackie Chan has great fights in Wheels on Meals and Who Am I? but both movies aren't exactly great. Ong Bak was a great film but never reached the brutal levels I wanted to see in such a visceral combat style. Ip Man is a great franchise but is more for mainstream audiences as far as violence goes.Then The Raid Redemption came out and it was like a heavenly light shone upon it. A movie lacking much of a budget, much style, but chock full of some of the most brutal violence in a martial arts film. It seems a rather divisive movie to some, though has become a cult classic. Roger Ebert's review of it was dreadfully low and it seemed many agreed. One review said it was a stupid movie for millennials who haven't seen Die Hard and Hardboiled (both great films). But those movies are so different.As Mad Dog says: \"I never liked using guns. It's like ordering takeout.\" And I wholeheartedly agree and find that's my reason for loving ultra-violent martial arts films. The visceral impacts, the bodily harm, the five minute fights that get increasingly more brutal and desperate. That's why The Raid Redemption succeeds for me.A twenty man SWAT group goes into a decrepit apartment block to arrest the denizens as well as take down the man in charge. The building has been a no-go for police and a safe haven for crooks of all sorts. A screw-up leads to the entire building learning the cops are there and leading to a desperate fight to escape. Our hero, the rookie Rama, uses a form of martial arts called Silat to survive.The plot is paper-thin to allow maximum action without all the pesky dialogue. The characters are also just there with little explanation of who they are. We know Rama as a father-to-be whose brother lives in the apartments. He pretty much has every generic plot imaginable tossed onto him. But I don't think it matters given the context of the film. Because the context is: sit back, relax, and watch some awesome action.And that it is. Aside from some poor CG gunfights early in and the occasional CG blood, the battles are brutal. The final fight, a five minute two-on-one, is worth the price of admission alone.With all that said, I'll throw out some complaints just to sound like I'm not a huge fanboy. The budget constraints mean that the movie does look cheap as far as the sets go. I'm guessing they reused apartments and hallways and most of the action, being as it is set in a building, is not open enough to seem like it's not a set. So if you're looking for a visually interesting movie aside from the fights, you'll be unimpressed. Gareth Evans, the director, does what he can with what he has and I believe used all his assets well.Another minor nuisance comes from the editing. I complained about constant cuts in my previous review of Police Story Lockdown and I'll say the same here. The hits are hard and look brutal, but there is a lot of cutting during some fights. There are stretches where that doesn't happen, impressive to behold, but I don't want to knock the movie too much for cutting around the action. Because no matter the fact, it's still impressive.Watching The Raid last night for the fourth time was a rush that left me with a smile on my face throughout. The ninety minute runtime blew by. It's a film for action fans and especially martial arts fans. It's set up to be open for a second film and, spoiler alert, that second film is one of my favorite movies of all time.",

While still in production Sony pictures acquired the distribution rights of the film for the U.S. Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park and Joseph Trapanese created a nice feel for the film musically that really gets you involved in the scenes. The film premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival and premiered at Sundance. The plot for this film is centered around, Rama a member of a special forces team, that arrives at a rundown apartment block with a mission to remove its owner, a notorious drug lord the building has become a sanctuary for killers, gangs, rapist and thieves Rama and his team must fight their way through every floor and every room not to just complete their mission but survive their bloody ordeal. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, some of the slow motion shots and angles really draw you into some of the scenes and the fighting in this film is like Bruce lee on steroids I'm not going to lie after the film was over. I wanted to kick some butt, which is awesome when a director can create a story like this and get your blood pumping they have successfully done their jobs if you have some time to watch this movie I seriously advise it. I go to the movies to be entertained and inspired by other directors works of art to summon up a good film of my own this movie was simply amazing, The action is nonstop and the fights are choreographed mostly by two of the main actors, overall a really well done film another film that deserves 10 movie reels out of 10.

True, Leon is the more complete story, and the characters are very well fleshed out, but this film succeeds due to its pace. It is quite an achievement to have one's adrenalin levels rise, and be kept high for nearly 2 hours. This marks this film out as a unique concept. Most film directors raise you up, then bring you down, then raise you up again. Not here. For nearly the whole film, you are kept *up*. Its amazing. For fight action and sequences, it makes Ong-Bak look pedestrian. I saw it this weekend in London, and am going back to see it again tomorrow. It just has to be seen on the big screen. I think the Welsh director will soon be on to much bigger things. On a relatively low budget, he has outperformed all other action films so far this year.......and I say that being a huge comic (Avengers et al) fan. Fantastic.",

Even if you don't appreciate violence in film, this part is totally mesmerizing. In reality, I think many bones would be broken way before the halfway mark of this last third of the film preventing this fight among three men from continuing, but that logic does not take away from the intensity.

If I'm judging this by the action sequences alone, this is the rating I'd give it since I've seen better, particularly from Jackie Chan, John Woo, Corey Yuen Kwai, and Yuen Woo-Ping and many more whose consisted to show action choreography that are charismatically filmed with camera angles that can motivate viewers to watch them multiple times and on multiple levels. \"The Raid: Redemption\" is better than writer / director Gareth Evans previous effort 2009 film \"Merantao\" which is close to rendition carbon copy of Tony Jaa's \"Ong-Bak\", except that \"Ong-Bak\" consisted to have dangerous stunts and not just the hard hitting fighting. I liked this film very much but it's not better than Tony Jaa's intricate action movie of \"The Protector\" because the stunts overall are much harder to perform, and are also more creative. The pattern for action films is not just good fighting but also about how they're camera filmed as well, and they're many scenes which the fights looked extremely dangerous to perform but the impact isn't always felt the same way. One fight in particular which needed two SWAT men to defeat him whose kind of a henchman but is extremely tough even though his other two opponents are taller and heavier.",

Unfortunately I live in Italy. Anyway coming to the film definitely was a nice surprise. Action action and more action what I've always sought in an action movie. But all is not limited to the classic scenes of a classic film of this kind but you get to the level of brutality and in my opinion fantastic realism. Despite the frenzy the scenes run off very fluid. Obviously and unfortunately the weak point of this film as in many others of the genre is the plot, I understand that is not the central point of the film, and in fact there fly over because it was not what I was looking for and I knew what I was expecting but trying to create a story at least decent do not think is a request so exaggerated. Curious to see the second.Ultimately if you want a film of pure action and pure really mean that, this is the film for you.7/10",

Once inside the building, the cops realizes that they are trapped with no way out of the building, engaging in the raid almost immediately and finding themselves outnumbered and outgunned, stumble into the midst of a massacre. What follows is a grueling one and a half hour of struggle which involves everything from bursting cylinders to machetes, to blood curdling fist fights, alpha male warriors getting their heads smashed into walls, their kidneys punched a couple dozen times, and their necks snapped back, wild warriors keep going with a jagged segment of a broken fluorescent tube sticking out of their necks! Its 101-minute fusillade of punching,head-spinning, heart-pounding, , kicking, stabbing, slashing, cracking, crunching, grouting and spurting.The group of SWAT police , a full equipped force, decked out head to toe in black uniforms, heavy tactical boots, ballistic vests, and helmets. Those alpha macho imposing uniforms begin to degrade as they're shred piece by piece over the course of the film. Rama, a virile macho cop armed with a standard-issue police baton and combat knife. He had an assault rifle and hand gun, but has discarded both after running out of ammo. Also still wearing most of his riot gear: flak vest, elbow & knee pads, but no helmet. While others get slammed harshly into walls and door, Rama stuns some thug with a club to the chest then reaches around to stab him in the back of the thigh. He stabs another in the upper thigh and then pulls the still-inserted blade nearly down to his knee. He stabs another right in the knee and then twists the knife. Throats get not just sliced but also clubbed in a enraged fury violence! The Raid: Redemption is Rambo's wet dream. It's the motivation behind John Matrix's blood lust on Commando, saw blade attacks to the skull, limb penetrating machete karate chops, and axe-to-groin devastation in a orgasmic display of carnage and testosterone filled mayhem! Especially when Mad Dog has the gun on the cop's head, puts it away and challenges him to hand to hand combat. Wow!!! Like what I read in a movie review: \".

            "content": "I bumped into it while I was changing TV channels. It got me good when I saw all the violence being thrown at me from the screen, so I decided I should at least watch it till the end. When the film ended, I felt like I experienced all the fights myself - my breathe was fast as I ran a mile, and I even had sweat on my forehead, thinking to myself \"Now that was a ride!\". I liked it, but I wasn't ready to say something about it - it wouldn't be very objective, and there wasn't anything to say except \"OH MY GOSH IT WAS FREAKIN' INCREDIBLE\".And so, a week or two later I re-watched it and liked the film even more. I wasn't paying attention to details during my first watch, but this time I saw much more then just a huge fight.Firstly, I would like to mention that I have never seen such creative camera work in action-packed films. All these shaky camera moves, Dutch angles in moments they were needed and some really clever shots - all this was highly innovative and 2010s-fresh. Camera work really helped with creating the desperate atmosphere of SWAT team being on the edge of death and trying to survive.Secondly, the soundtrack. I haven't heard the original version, but the American one with Mike Shinoda was simply outstanding. These electronic vibes with a pinch of brostep make all the violent fights and shootings even more aesthetic and beautiful. Seeing Iko Uwais beating the crap out of gangsters gives a very satisfying feeling by itself, but with the Mike Shinoda's compositions the effect becomes two or three times better. I have to say that this film has one of a few soundtracks I really want to buy and listen to separately. I don't want to say that I don't like other films' music, but this one truly overdone the soundtrack format.And thirdly, the direction. Gareth Evans did an extremely amazing work making all the shootings, fights and sounds into one solid piece of art. Colours, decorations and the way actors played really amazed me. There wasn't much unexpected moments in the plot, but actually I don't think this really matters in action films. As long as the script doesn't have any plot holes, it works really fine. I personally liked the themes this film talks about, though it may occur as a bunch of clich\u00e9s to somebody. All the effects were great enough too, considering the budget the film used.To sum up, I'd love to say that this film feels like a roller- coaster (in a good way). There is not much plot twists, but it's not really necessary. You'll get that much adrenaline in your blood, you won't need any serious dialogues, which are pretty good, anyway. If you want to experience some action and excitement, this film is definitely your choice.",

            "review_title": "The Raid: Redemption : A relentless action film with high body count",
            "content": "Its simple premise does not seem to make sense much at the beginning. An Indonesian SWAT team is dispatched to one of the most dangerous places in the city. It is a shabby 30-story building somewhere in the slum area, and we are informed that this is the headquarter of a notorious drug lord named Tama(Ray Sahetapy), who lives on the 15th floor while filling the building with his violent gangs as the landlord. I do not know why he chooses the 15th floor, but I know the movie would be longer if he lived on the 30th floor.And I do not understand why there are not more policemen to surround or infiltrate into this building. If they know that the building is not an easy place to attack at all, then why are only around 20 members of SWAT team sent to this place with only one riot van? Can't they accomplish their mission in a far safer way with more supports? The movie later reveals a hidden motive behind this mission, but I am rather amazed that the people incidentally not shown in the movie cannot think of a quieter way of taking care of their private problem with a far less body count.But never mind, folks, because the movie is all about actions to be generated from this barebone premise, not the plausibility of the plot. Under the command of the team leader(Joe Taslim), the SWAT team members quickly go inside the building and move upward carefully while not being noticed. Everything seems to go smoothly at first, but the building has many eyes including the cameras in the hallways and little boys, so they are eventually exposed and all hells break loose upon them instantly. Tama shuts down the entire building along with the communication line(my god, doesn't any of SWAT team member have a cellular phone just in case?) and then announces the killing time for his guys in the building.Once the first shooting starts inside the building, the movie hurls the characters into the series of frantic actions with no mercy. Besides the guns, the characters in the movie also use big knives and other objects available around them, and there are lots, lots, and lots of fights and killings happening here and there in the building. Out of curiosity, I checked my wristwatch, and I found at least more than 20 guys were already killed or injured during the first 30 minutes. And that was just a tip of iceberg; there were a lot more violence awaiting for me and the audiences during the rest of the running time, and I already felt numb with this continuing savageness when I watched in disbelief one character who kept fighting with two dudes while a piece of broken fluorescent light bulb was stuck in his neck. Ugh.I was impressed by the rapid and ferocious energy pulsating inside the fight sequences in the film. Most of SWAT team members are quickly killed by thugs, and the rest of them, including the team leader and a rookie member named Rama(Iko Uwais), try to escape from the building by any means necessary. As our hero, Rama fights with the bad guys many times for saving himself and others, and, choreographed by the Indonesian martial art experts Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhian(he played Tama's fearsome top lieutenant in the movie), these fights sequences feel real, electrifying, and sometimes scary. We can see that the actors on the screen are really fighting while using their body parts in spite of frantic camera movement, and, when the end credit was rolled, I was rather relieved to know that the movie hired 14 doctors and paramedics during the production.Yes, I worried to some degrees about the actors rapidly going through these dangerous actions, but what about the characters played by them? Well, I have to say there is not much of characterization in the shallow plot which barely supports the actions in the movie. Rama is given some background at the start, but it is not so important to the plot except giving us the reason why we want him to survive through his plight. His wife is pregnant, so we do not want to see a baby without his killing machine dad in the photo, right?It goes without saying that the other characters besides Rama are more or less than cardboards to be shot or stabbed or slashed or smashed or slaughtered or whatever. There is some melodrama element from the hidden bond between two characters in the plot, but there is no surprise in that. The dialogues are mostly perfunctory amid or between the sound and fury in the soundtrack, and the most memorable line in the movie will be \"Ahhhhhhhhhhh!\" or \"Arrrrrrrrgh!\". I was particularly amused by the cast list, which mostly consists of the nameless characters like \"Special Force #16\", \"Carrying Bowo Fighter #18\", \"Drug's Lab Guard #21\", \"Hole Drop Attacker #8\", and so on. Suppose you appear in the movie \u2013 can you boast to your friends about appearing as, uh, \"AK-47 shooter #3\"?Should I evaluate the movie as a ruthless but exhilarating ballet of martial arts, or a well-made but pointless rampage of brutal action? My feeling remain ambivalent due to its inherent weak points, but the director/writer/editor Gareth Evans made a competent action movie, and Iko Uwais is fully functional and professional as its action hero. His character is thin, but at least we can see how he uses his brain as well as his body in the chaotic circumstances, and I liked his actions more than, say, \"Transformers 3\". However, I also remember what Roger Ebert wrote in his review for \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragoon\"(2000): \"The best martial arts movies have nothing to do with fighting and everything to do with personal excellence.\"",

However, after I saw the Raid I was taken aback as none of the things that I listed above was in this movie which was absolutely astounding. There's so much clarity among the fight scenes that it almost feels like you're there with the fighters. The film is beautifully directed, I can't see any other way for it to be so for the stupid remake. Not only has this changed the action genre in a significant way it also made me appreciate foreign films more. Yes, there are bad things about this movie but imo they are very minor and the way this movie was shot makes you look pass that. Watching all those kung fu flicks when Evans was a boy, paid off for him in this and his previous film, Merantau. Kudos to you sirPeople keep saying that this is the best action film since Ong Bak, in no way is it the best film since Ong Bak, its the best film in decades. Ong is quite cringe worthy because of the acting that is displayed on screen and also because of the overused slo mo effect the director used when Jaa did something 'cool'. There are parts within the Raid that has slo mo in them but Evans made sure it was used in the most necessary wayIgnore the review that Roger Elbert had given this movie (1/4 stars) as he clearly doesn't understand nor appreciate a well made film that proves that you don't need to have much depth in your characters or in your story. Though he does point out some NOT all good reasons as to why the film wasn't for him but some of these reasons are beyond ridiculous. This movie was beyond my expectations, it was beautifully directed and the fight scenes were very much believable, the guy who did the sound effects for the punches and the kicks should also be thanked for it to be believable as s/he didn't use those effects where you could obviously tell that those punches or kicks didn't land.Thank u Mr Evans for showing Hollywood that you don't need a billion dollar budget to make a good action flick and needing such a sophisticated storyline and character depth and that all you need is to be smart at what you do.OK the ones who say that there is shaky cam in the fight sequences are freakin retarded, I couldn't even see the camera shaking when the fight scenes were on, they were as clear as day. Also, people saying 'oh everyone in the building knows some type of martial arts, how typical' in their review or on the discussion board needs to watch this film again, NOT everyone knew how to fight it was only some. If you think that holding and shooting a gun, wielding a machete around or throwing a couple of punches is some form of martial arts then wow you must have an IQ of a room temperature.",

I have a special spot in my heart for Bruce Lee, of course, but he didn't make that many movies. Jackie Chan and Tom Cruise are probably my two favorite action actors of all time; not only do they do their own stunts, which are insane, by the way, but they nail their acting parts to the teeth as well.Anyways, while looking for good action films, this film was listed very high in dozens of lists and held in a very high standard as an instant action film classic. Did it live up to my expectations? Well holy crap, it did.Let's go with the positives first:The action. Oh my God, the action in this film. From a technical aspect, it's perfectly filmed, amazingly edited and beautifully choreographed, with a very raw, desperate, tense and urgent feeling to each confrontation. It's brutal. It doesn't hold back in any way, but it isn't gory or graphic in unnecessary ways, but rather in a more realistic manner. You feel every hit landing. Its as if one were there with the troopers. Its very clear that the actors do their own fighting, too. The action here is amazing.The acting: special kudos to Joe Taslim and some of the other soldiers. Taslim transmits perfectly the anguish, pain, rage, and stress that would come from being in a situation like this, and his fight scenes are amazing. Iko Uwais was amazing in the action front, but his acting is not nearly as solid as the aforementioned JT; that being said, he does quite a good job.The atmosphere: its tense. You feel the suspense. Anything could happen, and anyone could die at any moment. Its gritty and realistic.And now, lets go with the one issue this movie has, which is that the story is not as solid, and there are some subplots which I will not spoil that could be more effective if given a little more time and the acting were a little better.In conclusion, this is an amazing movie. A true must see for any action junkie or martial artist out there.",

Overall, I enjoyed the movie very much. The reason why I didn't give it a higher score was because the plot was not very deep and because some of the dialogue was a little cheesy.Other than that, this was a very fun movie to watch. It is brutally violent throughout with a lot of cool action scenes with some pretty sweet martial arts moves.Overall, if you are prepared for mindless violence, this is the movie for you. Enjoy.",

Star Wars was an amalgam of lots of thing such as Abbott and Costello, Metropolis, Gone with the Wind, Flash Gordon, Dogfight movies, and influences from Akira Kurosawa.And now with Raid Redemption, there is an amalgam as well, we can take Black Hawk Down as basis, then mixing with the ending of Game of Death, of course there is some Die Hard to it, some mentioned ''Kill Bill'', there is a hint of the Untouchables because the villain is very Al Capone-like, and some hint of Fists of Legends too. Of course the fight scenes are choreographed, but they seem so realistic at the same time.All to write, Raid Redemption is one intense action movie. It's not to be missed. The plot might be thinned, but it is so technically well done.This movie is my favourite action movie of all time.",

            "content": "The plot was minimalistic. Usually action movies are but this was almost non existent. Why did almost every single person in this movie know some form of martial arts. At first it felt like playing the first Resident Evil game or something along those lines but it was just one fast paced fight after another. Admittedly the gore was done quite well but there should have been some serious re-writes for this movie as it had some pacing issues. Yes we get it our hero knows how to fight but take a hostage like the chief of polices daughter, the heroes wife.. something! Instead of us just blindly going in like we're playing the nintendo game Kung Fu from 1984.Usually I don't check my emails or anything along those lines but watching a movie like this was an exception. It's to the point you just get bored of all the fighting. The snipers I felt weren't used enough. Sure there are buildings with more than 4 sides but what was stopping them from moving to another vantage point especially at a point of them movie where we forget that they are there. What did they have to go pick up their kids from school? Was it time for a nap? Did the sleazy looking boss only give them 4 rounds each. The ending was just lazy and that final fight scene with skinny greasy guy and the two went on wayyyy too long. You could use the washroom or make ramen noodles, boil the water and everything and the fight would still be going. II found that there were members of the gang that didn't look tough enough and the people under the boss didn't seem tall. Muscular or scary enough. At least the hero actually got injured in fights not like the worlds greatest actor of all time Steven Seagal. My favorite scene in this had to be the machete going through the wall but this was just bland. Unless you've only seen like 5 or 10 action movies it's so boring where the saving grace is the gore. Is it just me or is the poster wrong? They said 30 floors but there isn't.",

Well..that is until the fight stops near the end of the movie where the plot started to make my eyes and brain hurting again :pI gave 10 out of 10 only for the action part.

Their mission is simple, catch one of the number one criminal criminals who became the owner of the apartment and return safely.This is one of the best action films owned by Indonesia. One of the films that is starting to feel like a Hollywood action movie. The Raid has an exciting and challenging story premise. The premise of the story is carried with consistent conflict until the end of the film to keep the excitement of this film. I see this film as selling more on the action side of the action than a story conflict that looks simple. It deals with several scenes that have plot holes in explaining the story and the main conflicts in this film. The Raid presents each scene by providing a sense of tension, excitement, amazement from the action shown. The action of martial arts games that become an exciting and fun fighting force to watch, ranging from bare hands to using a machete. This film also presents martial arts action as a model of fighting. Stunning combat with brutal, sadistic and crazy elements can be felt perfectly.It is worth appreciating in the acting performance of this film, starting from Iko Uwais, Joe Taslim, Yayan Ruhiyan, Donny Alamsyah to Ray Sahetapy. Excellent acting from actors who have skills in martial arts, except for Ray and Donny. As the main enemy, Ray is able to bring a character that looks intimidating with his calm and decisive nature. Yayan acts as a Mad Dog who appears crazy with his good martial arts choreo. Also at the end of the epic and incredible fight becomes the finale of this film.",

What seems like a routine mission on paper is anything but as it becomes increasingly apparent that the real problem is surviving long enough to get back out again.The story may seem rudimentary, but it in its brief runtime it manages to input more than enough character development to keep things from becoming stale. But... this film hasn't been designed to tell a compelling story. It's a setup for some of the most exciting and creative action sequences ever put to film, all set to the throbbing pulse of its sound design.'The Raid' is a breathtaking display of martial arts choreography; a constant sensory assault of bloodthirsty mayhem, with each floor rigged to explode into frenetic action. And Gareth Evans is well aware how to expertly stage these sequences by letting the camera linger on the fight scenes. There's no obtrusive close-ups, no rapid edits, just plenty of extended shots to showcase the talent of the individuals and their fighting techniques on camera.The violent criminals think they have things covered, but what they don't count on is Rama (Iko Uwais) not only fighting back, but messing everyone up in style. Whether using his bare hands to batter his opponents, or using the environment to bone-crunching effect, he demonstrates a skillset few people have. He's a hero worth rooting for as he turns the tables on his attackers (sometimes literally) and forges a bloody path to the top of the high-rise.Unrelenting and unforgettable, writer/director/editor Gareth Evans has taken a simple premise, executed it with flair, and turned out a masterful, memorable action thriller.",

What I will say though is that this movie is the best action movie of all time. Of course that's my opinion but this coming from someone who's in the military, trains in martial arts and has seen many action movies. The fight scene choreography is amazing and is the most realistic I have ever seen. Some people may complain that; 1. The fights are too long 2. The fighters attack too often/too much 3. Real life fighting is like (insert MMA arena tournament here) and not this movie.I will post my response to those complaints later on. Now when you start watching 'The Raid' you have to realize it's 75% martial arts, 15% gun fights and 10% story. I mean that in a good way (especially if you like action). 10% story doesn't mean the story sucks, it just means there's not much of it. The movie has a rather dark and gritty tone to it the whole time. If you want a fun and happy action movie this is definitely not it.Story: There's a drug lord who owns an apartment building and a highly trained swat team is going in to take him down.Overall there's lots of very realistic fight scenes, a couple good shoot outs and one hell of a villain toward the end. They say you buy an action movie for the action, and this movie is insanely packed with intense nonstop action from start to finish.The whole movie is in Indonesian and I recommend leaving it in Indonesian (with subtitles of course) even though you won't understand them. Why? Because the yells and screams are much more intense and believable than the English dubbing. Not to mention the English voice actors suck. They sound very cheesy and ruin the whole movie with their version of the dialog.My response to the complaints; 1. Would you rather get more for your money or get a 5 second fight for your money? Also two trained fighters are not going to be out of a fight at the first hit. 2. Real life fighting is far more aggressive, You're trying to kill the other person after all. You're not trying to 'earn a point' or 'win the match'. You're constantly trying to break or damage any part of them you can. 3. Arenas and tournaments have rules, real life doesn't.That being said, I do respect the MMA world but it's more for entertainment as far as I'm concerned.",

It doesn't rely on a brilliant plot or Oscar-worthy acting, instead relying on violence, violence and more violence. That's not to say the entire film is just fighting. We are introduced to the plot, it goes wrong and the main characters become trapped. From here, the film goes from one amazing fight scene, to a break. In this break from the action, characters are developed. Then another big action scene followed by a break. This cycle occurs three or four times in the film.

The movie wastes no time and gets right to the point. That being, the action.The action scenes (which are not few and far between) are directed marvelously by Gareth Evans and his team. My only complaints being the amount of shaking camera in the first few action moments. Aside from that, the action is shot really well and choreographed brilliantly. We get the right balance between martial arts fights and shooting sequences. The action is realistic, despite there being a few moments which are hard for us to believe actually happened without lethal consequences for the characters involved.The acting is good for an action film and immerses the viewer into the gritty and brutal environment. My biggest mistake was that I watched the movie with English dubbing,which was horribly executed and I do not advise anyone to do so.The soundtrack was serviceable (not anything you would remember) and the pacing was good and balanced well between more intense scenes and slower, character developing ones.All in all, it was one of the best action movies I've watched in a long time and I'll surely watch it again some day.",

            "content": "The plot of \"The Raid: Redemption\" is beautifully simple. A SWAT team who have broken into a tower block controlled by a gang lord have become trapped inside and the few that remain must fight their way out. There are a few other subplots that drift into focus occasionally, but they are described so vaguely and have almost no relevance to the action, it's as though the filmmakers knew they were kidding themselves. All that matters here is the action.Usually I'd criticise a film for sticking to the basics and not risk being original, but it's had to care when one lone cop is taking on corridor after corridor full of opponents, using only his fists, feet and occasional knife for good measure. Audiences' queasy at the sight of blood should probably stay away; the brutality in this film cannot be exaggerated. I can't remember the last time (if ever) I have winced so loudly at what I was watching. Heads disappear into walls, knives into throats, bodies are pummelled so relentlessly it's amazing the characters don't crawl hands and knees into the next scene. Thankfully, the film is superbly directed by Brit director Gareth Evans so the action remains coherent and instead of feeling repetitive and tiresome we are left hanging for the next fight. Instead of resorting to the confused shaky cam of the generic Hollywood thriller, Evans knows when to step back and let the audience revel in the amazingly choreographed fights or other times follow the cops through holes in the floor or even as they fall three floors from a window onto a fire escape in mid-fight. (I learn that Hollywood is planning their inevitable remake which will be sure to correct this for brain dead audiences leaving Alex Cross.) We mostly stick with rookie cop Rama (Iko Uwais) as he tries to help his injured friend escape in between battering one charging tenant after another. Some people have likened this film to a video game and I don't disagree. As soon as one opponent is dispatched, another eagerly steps forward oblivious to the dark stain on the wall that seconds before was his predecessor. Even the climactic showdown with the gang leader's henchman feels much like a boss fight. Uwais deserves credit for giving Rama at least enough personality to root for him as he charges through the movie, assisted no doubt by the lazy clich\u00e9 of the Pregnant Wife Back At Home. He deserves even more for his astonishing martial art skills, which are easier to simply watch in awe than for me to describe.Some people will criticise this film for not bringing anything new to the table (other than the bloody heads of tenants) in the way of character development or an interesting plot and to some extent I agree. Had the director maybe taken the time before entering the building to establish Rama's character more and build on the reason for them being there I probably would have admired \"The Raid: Redemption\" even more. But there are times when I really couldn't care less whether a movie transcends its genre or provides me with an emotionally enriching experience. I just want to see s#!t beat up.As a side note, the \"Redemption\" in the title can't help but feel irrelevant, unless redemption involves killing a lot of people or it is just establishing the possibility of a \"Raid\" franchise. If the latter is true, count me in.",

After the team has arrived and got into this tenement, they become trapped inside the building and escaping the building seems to be harder than it was to get into\u0085This film was directed very well by Gareth Evans who created a good looking movie, well, good not necessarily good-looking color wise as they made the color grading look very dirty to capture the dark atmosphere. The framing though was really good. This is an action film as you could've guessed, so it's bound to have fighting sequences, and since this movie is praised specifically for that part, I was expecting quite a lot of this. And, did it surpass my expectations? Absolutely. They were amazing. This movie is worth watching just for the action scenes, something you don't hear a lot these days. The director obviously loved the martial arts used in the film and he translates that very well to the big screen. Gareth Evans, the director, was also keen on his use of edits as he at times didn't cut away from the action for a couple of seconds and created these amazing fighting sequences that had a fantastic flow to them. He was also able to keep these scenes easy to follow, also something not a lot of movies do right these days, by having the camera stay steady and don't cut every second. It's been a while since I've seen a movie where the stunt work was as good as it is in this one and The Raid deserves all the credit it's getting for having the best fight choreography. The whole film was practically one big action scene with some intermissions, so it would've been a shame if the action scenes were not as good as they are now. There were also these dumb moments (the fridge scene), but the film knows that those scenes are silly and they don't try to take themselves serious, which is always a good thing for a movie to do. The make-up and set design were all pretty good considering the low budget they had the work with. But those intermissions brought some problems to the table. The film has a pretty fast pace throughout the film, but stops abruptly every time there's an intermission in which they try to develop characters. I don't mind that they develop their characters, since I like to see a movie with well-rounded characters that feel like real people, but the problem is that the writing in those scenes just wasn't that good. They were mostly clich\u00e9d, like the opening sequence in which they want us to relate to the main character, but ultimately fail at doing that, because they use a technique that has been done a million times before, which is a real shame. Throughout the movie thought there are some actions he does whereby we get to know him for a bit, it's just those moments when the movie abruptly comes to a stop where the problem lays.The acting was pretty good though and they set up the villain nicely with the use of only one scene. His acting was really good and he came over really menacing. Iko Uwais, who played the protagonist, his acting was really good and because of this he made his character feel more real than the writing itself did. I did like that the characters each had their vulnerabilities to them and that they affected how they fought and not that they were able to shake it off.As you're able to see of that little description of the story it seems to be fairly simple. Not overly complicated, just straightforward and I liked that. A lot of B-movies reach for the over convoluted story to cover up the fact that theirs is simple or just dumb. In The Raid that's not the case. There's no complicated story needed and it's also not trying to cover up the fact that it's straightforward. The film knows what it is and it embraces that really hard. But that all doesn't mean that the story isn't clever. It's actually quite clever in the way the story is constructed. It's constructed like an old 80's or 90's video game, namely that you have to build your way up to the final boss-level while each level starts to get harder and harder. In the end this was an amazing action film, but just a decent film overall. The acting was good, but the characters were lacking, which obviously lays within the screenplay, which wasn't the greatest. The action scenes however were shot amazingly and the so was the fight choreography. That's why this film gets a 7.5/10.",

            "content": "The Raid An action movie that everyone is talking about and claimed that it was a breakthrough as both action and martial art genre which is the one and only The Raid:Redemption. this movie was praised by both critics and film goers which both agreed that it is a great action movie in recent years,yet even one critics claimed that this movie has made most of Hollywood action movie into a shame since The Bourne Ultimatum. Being a breakthrough in both action movie and martial art which i can't argue about it because the movie is some kind of a breakthrough in terms of action movie rules and concept when most people(even critics) says that this movie is perfect or flawless,it is certainly not. the films is all about violence with martial arts as the main tools to make it thrilling and exhilarating,filmmaker Gareth Evans managed to use it to create some kind of symphony of street fighting which makes up most of the movie.the fighting choreograph was flawless and convincing because it looks like they really passionate about the whole process. From start to finish,The raid filled with blood pumping combat from guns battle,deadly hand to hand combat,and vicious machete duel which fuel the movie with adrenaline and excitement.A group of S.W.A.T team led by lieutenant Jaka(Joe Taslim) has been given a command to capture notorious crime lord named Tama (Ray Sahetapy) who famous for his power and ruthless behavior toward his victim.but the group consist of rookie cop including Rama (Iko Uwais) who didn't know that his latest task will change his life forever. Although full of rookie,Leutant Jaka confident that his leadership will not effected the mission to infiltrate the infamous compound which was used by Tama to protect his empire from every police that want to take him down.after they reach the compound,they begin to infiltrate the compound with caution so they couldn't be detected and their infiltration goes well until they faced a young spotter who managed to alert other spotter,eventually their mission begin to crumble when Tama traps them in the 6th floor and switch off the electricity to assassinate them one by one.The story is light and simple without not much of a twist and rather predictable,but it is also the weakest part of the movie since the plot hasn't been structured from the beginning that makes the movie didn't have a story to tell and lost its meaning since the aspect of the story is really weak. beside story what the raid didn't manage to deliver is the dialog,even thought dialog is not much important for general movie audience,but it does matter for some viewers and it is certainly important for critic,because dialog also help to make the movie has more meaning but storytelling and meaning was certainly not the priority here. aside from action sequence,the raid has nothing to offer since it almost has no plot or dialog so the character also has nothing to do beside keep fighting enemies that being thrown off constantly by the crime boss Tama,fortunately most of the actor is an expert in martial arts so their ability save them from making the character completely bland.the rising martial artist Iko Uwais was the headline of the movie because his skill make the character worth to watch.beside him,actor and fighting choreograph Yayan Ruhian should have been given credit because without him and Uwais the movie would't have the exhilarating vicious combat.despite major flaw that the movie has,the raid is fun and exciting movie to watch,watching the raid is like playing a good game that lack of story which make us curious and sympathize about the character journey,unfortunately this is what the raid doesn't have so overall the raid has nothing to impress beside its fighting sequence which is becoming monotonous as the movie progress.if you want meaningful story and unforgettable character this movie is definitely not a recommendation.",

            "review_title": "A pointless ride of nonstop gang brutality and stylized death sequences, however one the best presentations of martial arts thus far in cinema. Is it a fair trade-off?",
            "content": "My main problem with the movie is that the plot can be written entirely on a cocktail napkin. This movie is nothing more than a ride. Although make no mistake about it, The Raid Redemption is one damn good ride. The martial arts are not only of the highest standard but also fresh, like nothing you've ever seen before. If your even mildly interested in action movies then this flick will leave a mark as one of the most outrageous products to come out of Asian cinema. Except outrageous doesn't equal enjoyable to all fans. So here's the summary of the plot in one line: A SWAT team goes on an operation to invade a gang- controlled building in conquest of eliminating the leader and his conspirators which are located atop the highest floor. There you go, shut your brain off from there and watch the uncompromising display of violence. As the audience we follow Iko Uwais with his role of Rama, but as hard as the movie tries to attach us to Rama's plight by convincing us he's an honorable family man, by the end this attempt falls through because the setup to his character is only mentioned in a few lines in order to sacrifice screen time for the action. Now generally most action movies barely setup their protagonists in the beginning, but the Raid Redemption doesn't even give us enough breathing room to become accustomed to Rama along the way. In that sense the movie is only a nonstop ride of baddies getting stabbed and shot. The \"twists\" are some of the most clich\u00e9d possible in the genre, and the conclusion doesn't clear much up other than \"F$#% yeah we're the best. Cue the slo- mo and epic music\". The movie's start shoves the audience into the action then at the end abruptly takes us out once more. I felt the conclusion to be awkward and leave me numbed in hopes of further closure. Hate me for this, but I believe an intriguing story is what compliments and satisfies watching intense action. I didn't feel for Rama or his team, plus his team isn't \"present enough\" for me to care about them anyway. The violence sure was genuine and fit the tone, but I can't look past the flaws in the story and character development. -6/10",

I love action movies so it's not as if this isn't my type. A swat team goes on an unofficial mission and starts killing everyone in a building.

            "content": "The Raid promises \"1 minute of romance, 99 minutes of carnage\", which for anyone hungry for non-stop violence bodes extremely well. With such a rousing tagline, one envisions a bloody ballet, complete with bullets, punches, explosions and most importantly, the kinetic spirit that makes the best action films the joyfully bombastic escapades they generally are. And, to a certain extent, The Raid delivers. The action scenes are long, brilliantly choreographed, and painted with a healthy coat of thick, crimson blood. Unlike American films, each punch has consequences, and the characters seem almost human in their pain tolerance, while delightfully inhuman in every character and supporting characters' apparent mastery of kung fu.But beyond the action sequences, The Raid simply is not a good film. The plot is easily understood, but awkwardly staged, staggering from outrageous scenario to outrageous scenario without providing the viewer with the required sense of progression. The ending is abrupt, peddling a strange theme instead of the triumph I expected (and would have greatly appreciated), rendering the film the cinematic equivalent of a half-squeezed lemon. Lovingly squeezed, but half- squeezed nonetheless.The Raid tells the story of a police raid on an apartment building gone horribly wrong. After his unit is massacred and he finds himself alone and targeted by scores of machete-wielding Indonesians, Rama, a young Indonesian police officer, is forced to fight for his life. If you've seen Dredd (2012), the story is very similar, a lone warrior facing off against an army out to kill him. These films work best when the lone warrior is actually alone, like in Die Hard. John may have had help outside, but inside the building, he was alone except for his wits and his skills. In The Raid, Rama isn't completely alone, which was a poor choice by the screenwriters. It would have been much funner if he was.But beyond that, the film has little progression. Rama runs around and beats people up, reunites briefly with his estranged brother (a particularly cringe-inducing sequence that seems to have no purpose other than to instill boredom), and coats himself in blood and sweat. Finally, when it seems like the screenwriters have run out of scenarios, they end the film. In that sense, it plays out like a Looney Tunes cartoon, with the villains trying different and disconnected strategies to finish Rama off, only to have Rama to counter with his fists. Once the shock factor wears off, the film becomes painfully repetitive. There is a subplot involving the Lieutenant, but it's trite and forgettable.Perhaps the best scene in the film, the only one that connects it to the viewer, is that one minute of romance, when Rama, disoriented and confused, stops for a moment and imagines his pregnant wife. That scene reflects the humanity that the rest of the film is so desperately in need of. We try to focus on Rama, but by the actions of the screenwriters and the non-stop action, he is less a character than he is a bloody plot device.The action scenes are well done, the acting is nothing to be ashamed of, but the film itself, despite almost fulfilling its promise of 99 minutes of carnage, is a colossal bore.",

It's sad that only one of the 20 policemen is able to \"use\" pencak silat while the others are just there to feed the story but need to die quickly so Iko Uwais can shine...that's actually very American and I don't like it.Seeing so many 8-10* reviews I expected much more.

There is a paper thin \"plot\", and the fight scenes are incredibly repetitive. If you enjoy watching Pro Wrestling, this is probably the film for you. The film contains a lot of highly scripted \"dance\" martial arts where the baddies run at the good guy one at a time, and get beaten to a bloody pulp with a serious of highly unrealistic martial arts moves that really fail to convince. There are lots of bits where the good guy gets knocked to the floor, and instead of getting beaten to a mangled mess as would happen in real life by a competent opponent, he does one of those kicks from his back to the leg of his opponent, that looks about effective as a flick to the ear, but miraculously this leads to the assailant being sent hurtling though the air, doing a few back flips, and then crashing to the floor unconscious/dead. Well, that's a slight exaggeration but you know what I mean I'm sure... Its all just over the top, hard to believe, nonsense. It is dance, not combat.However, maybe that's the point and perhaps this reviewer is a little jaded from over-exposure to real-life competitive combat in mixed martial arts, and thus the dance fighting in these types of films just doesn't work for me anymore. I accept this is a real possibility.Anyway I was thoroughly bored for most of this film, but in saying that, I did actually finish it, which is something at least. If you are interested in set-piece, unrealistic, fight scenes, where the hook is the talent of the choreographers and the performers (IE the type of stuff you get in Pro wrestling), then this film might impress you. However, if you want an engaging plot, story, realistic action and characters that you can buy into and believe, then just save yourself 90 minutes and give this one a miss.",

            "content": "I somewhat naively agreed to see this movie with my partner. He loves martial arts and action movies. I enjoy cinema generally, especially foreign films, and usually don't mind fun action movies that skimp a little on plot. The Raid, however, was 2+hrs of my life that i will sadly never get back. I found the incessant, meaningless violence (with complete lack of plot or character development) totally nauseating. The only reason I wasn't bored was because I felt physically ill and entirely bewildered by the lack of plot, horrific brutality and gore. I kept waiting for the scene to change and the intensity to fluctuate and the story to develop.....but instead, it was as if I had to watch the same scene on replay (albeit with a different talented stuntman and slightly changed-up weapon and bone-slicing, liver- piercing, brain-splattering moves...). I can appreciate the talented stunt-men and the impressive camera-work involved but the pros ended there for me and these were entirely cancelled by the mind-numbing brutality and lack of depth. I am aware that I'm probably one of the few females to review (and quite possibly see) this movie. Some might say I'm too 'sensitive' and 'delicate' to appreciate such an intense 'action' movie. In reply, I'd say I'm proud to be so. I am glad i still view extreme violence as ugly and degenerate (not something to admire or be excited by). I am a little concerned for those who enjoy such incessant brutality and gore. I am an ER nurse (so I care for car accident and stabbing victims in real life and see blood everyday). I watch fantasy/fictional films to be transported and elevated from my every day existence. The Raid, however, I found neither thought- provoking, exciting nor enriching. I was just left confused and thankful it had ended.",

            "content": "This film will raise the interest in Indonesian martial arts, called Silat. This is just a simple, yet awesome reason to watch this movie.The film start fast. After just a few minutes from start, it drops into an automatic rifle combat, witch will touch the hearts of old Counter Strike players. The second half of the movie, is almost purely about Indonesian martial arts show. Maybe this sounds negative to some of you, but you need to see this yourself. You will find a move complexity, that you've been waiting for, since The Matrix. Intesity of melee fighting scenes, is more brutal and detailed, than everything I've seen in similar movies. Unfortunately, there is a major problem with these scenes. This is also the reason why the movie gets only 8/10 from me. Most of the actors and stuntmen, are extremely professional fighters, witch is a good thing. Some scenes and execution moves are simply jaw-dropping. Make no mistake, each and every fight scene is phenomenal. The problem is that a human body, simply cannot take this amount of damage. In every scene, everyone takes massive attack. Even one simple kick of these guys, would take down an ordinary person. However, the movie operates with very long scenes, where the bad guys are really hard to beat. Sometimes it feels simply impossible, when actor X can still stand up, after taking such bone cracking hits. Fortunately, actors keep using the environment and surrounding objects, so the diversified combat will make you forget, that you should'nt believe what you see.As you may assume, focusing this hard on never ending action, takes away the storytelling. But thanks to the great cinematography, we don't really care why all this is happening. The reason for the whole raid, is absolutely irrelevant till the very end of the movie. Photograpy and audio composition is simply great. The camera changes to another at exactly the right time. Every fighting scene filmed from many different, cleverly used angles. Some non-fighting scenes are also close to artistic. Moderate lighting, mixed with a grey overall color tone, are also very useful to keep up the feeling of stress. As mentioned, the music is also a big plus. The soundtrack is a great mix of drum & bass, punk rock and electronic tracks.As an overall conclusion, The Raid is a must see for everyone who likes action films. In the huge crowd of nowadays, ultra-gigantic budgeted CGI movies, this is a refreshing, sometimes illogical but definitely entertaining movie.",

Having said that belief does need suspended as some of the people in this film really do seem indestructible. For me some of the fight scenes towards the end did start to drag for me.

The very first shoot-out in the stairway with the slow-mos was brilliant, from that point i didn't think it as a good movie, but rather an art. Fight scenes with Iko Uwais when he's against multiple bad-guys were unbelievable, the field of view it gave to the person watching was great, leaving no move unseen. Why not 10 if i loved it so dearly? Its only because few of the fights went little overboard with how long they lasted.I'd recommend to anyone who appreciates fine martial arts imported to a good action movie.",

What I can say, this kind of movie perhaps has its own specific audiences. If you are amongst of them, you should RATE The Raid with 9 AT THE LEAST!!To think again, Gareth Evans, the director probably wants us to leave our brain outside the cinema's door, don't analyze anything, don't ask what's behind the story, just enjoy the non-stop actions and The Raid will make you hold your breath for more than 60 minutes!!!I am, exactly, not amongst of those.

I was told that it was in Japanese or another foreign language, so I would have to get by understanding the story by reading the subtitles. Now I quote from the Hobbit : \"I have never been so wrong in all my life!\". The film was awesome! From the moment the group of soldiers were trapped inside the block and the order to kill them came over the loudspeakers, I was really anticipating what would happen next. I absolutely loved it! The action throughout, which would have made a normal Hollywood movie very boring, seemed to fit perfectly with the film, making it one of my favourite movies of the 21st century! The fight scenes were very realistic, and even had me and my friends flinching when something particularly nasty happened to somebody. It made me fell as though I was part of the movie, and I was really exhilarated when it ended.If there is one improvement I could suggest, it would be some of the twists in the storyline- the fact that the group were able to get into the building so easily (seeing as it had been run by mobsters) was unrealistic and also, why did the sharpshooters only take out the cameos when they were looking out of a window, and not the main character, when he was? However, the film was a great success (certainly better than some Hollywood movies I've seen) and I would highly recommend it to the older ages of today's generation.",

            "content": "A succession of admittedly well choreographed fight scenes, in an over-gritty, computer game like scenario. The opening scenes play out like nothing more than an elaborate, and well-filmed shoot-em-up, and the first twenty minutes or so are full of fairly standard gung-ho macho gun worship, and bang-bang action, of the sort that isn't remotely \"realistic\" - it focuses far more on over-elaborate squibs and gore effects than anything else. Once the guns are down, and Rama is taking on hordes of bad guys, then the film really takes off. However, we never quite leave behind the feeling of a slightly murky tightrope walk, between immorality, and just plain brutality. There's nothing heroic about \"The Raid\"'s fight scenes, and instead, there is little more than a grass roots heroism about the main character, which serves to justify the carnage that ensues.Fight scenes unfold with a rapidity and intensity that is dynamic, but often or not, they are built round rather complex, or unusual \"gags\", or set pieces, and have little internal rhythmn of their own, which is why the best fight scenes are generally the short ones - when Rama goes up against the machete gang, or the dozen or so thugs in the first hallway. The end fight is gruelling indeed, and its' finale is another piece of gritty bloodshed, which never quite feels right, coming form the hero.Traditional martial arts films - arguably, this film takes the \"Game of Death\" pagoda concept, and plonks it down in the middle of an urban, decayed environment - were about good people going up against scum, and handing them their butts. This feels more like a survival film, and the heroism is all but gone from the blandly idealistic Rama (well acted, but generally, rather conflicted in the scripting process), so instead, it's difficult to fully feel that we're on his side. It's a story which pares itself down to the absolute minimum, and its' attraction, its' selling point, is that it features realistic looking fight scenes, in an intense, and simplistic setting, without using the dreaded wirework, or CGi. It does this, indeed, but rather than over the top choreography, its' the intensity of its' wall to wall bloodshed that feels rather unrealistic. The movie's aesthetic is down and dirty, with both heroes and villains employing functional, but ugly fighting moves. It features impressive stuntwork definitely, however, and the fights are arguably as good looking as anything seen in films these days, but it's rather too unnecessarily bleak and bloody for its' own good - with a storyline of such comic-book simplicity, the over the top nature of the spaltter and dismemberment becomes rather wearing, and, far from feeling exciting, tends to be dwelt upon with a fetishistic zeal and attention, that makes you wonder just where the director's sympathies lie: with the idealistic, but brutal hero, or with the massacring psychopaths that he goes up against. Entertaining, it does what it sets out to do, but you could wish for a little more icing, and a little less grit, on your cake, than this.",

The camera work is not very good, it is mostly designed to try to thrill you. This means that you get way to much movement of the camera, and some action scenes have so many cuts they could give you a seizure. Even a scene in a room where characters are talking the camera moves annoyingly when you wish it would just stay still for a second.2. Let's get this out of the way quick, the plot is nothing to write home about. The premise set up in the ad campaign is misleading. It goes 1 Ruthless Crime Lord, 20 elite cops, 30 floors of hell. In reality the ruthless crime lord is some guy who rents apartments to criminals, but he is ruthless. The 20 cops are mostly new recruits and about 15 are instantly killed off so not really 20. And finally the movie covers 15 floors, but the first 7 are covered in a montage so there's that.3. Action. Well there is some good and bad here. There is some gore and brutality which can be intense but also feels as though they added it in solely for shock value at times. Too much CGI blood. There are fistfights, these are a mixed bag. Some fights are pretty awesome, while others seem uninspired, some people get kicked in the leg once and they go down and are out of the fight, same with some punches, it gets disappointing. In one fight the main guy is trying to hide from guys with machetes, the floor is littered with tons of weapons from guys who just tried to kill him and he has loads of time but this is an action movie so he obviously doesn't grab one. The action starts out cool but then you start to get mundane fights where he mostly just pushes people or doesn't really do anything spectacular at all, kinda hurts the film. Then the movie takes a hit when all realism goes out the window and you get fights that just don't matter anymore. There are 2 fights in the movie that just drag on forever. There is no meaning, people take massive hits that have no effect on them whatsoever multiple times and it drags on before finally ending. A guy gets his head smashed into a concrete floor very hard several times and keeps fighting. And this after he has been hung up and beaten in the guts for minutes on end. By the time it ends it feels as though you have watched the exact same moves 5 times already, especially the last fight where you see the same moves literally done the exact same way, same camera shot and everything multiple times, and some of these moves are pretty mundane. I felt as though I had watched 1 fight 6 times when it ended and was not impressed at all. That said there is indeed some cool stuff but by the end it feels like a mixed bag of very neat moments and long periods of uninspired mediocrity.4. Finally there is one guy in the movie who looks white and cannot fight at all and appears in a fight scene he just looks awful his only move is to throw a 1-2 punch and then push a shelf on people.",

So I have been looking into it for months and watching it, I can see why people say that, but the two films are quite different. I won't be going into these differences in this post, though I want to on another post.So I had some \"technical issues\" when I first put it in. The film starts off in Indonesian, for no reason. I guess authenticity, but if you're going to make a foreign film, don't call name it something English. Thankfully, you can opt for an English dub, but naturally the voices aren't synchronized if you do go for the dub. And even when I got the voices in English, I couldn't get the subtitles off for some reason. And the subtitles don't even correlate with the dub. Anyways, at least everything makes sense in English, even if it comes across as mildly barbaric.The first 30 or so minutes are pretty boring and monotonous, with action being \"two guys sitting behind cover while spraying bullets\", which isn't very fun to watch. There's a way to have gunfights in films feel fun and bombastic. Look at Kingsman, or Equilibrium, which have incredible gunfights. This film doesn't do anything like that with its gunfights, making them feel boring, if incredibly chaotic as the film has outright brutal deaths and has no quarrel with filling the screen with people. Around the 30 minute mark, the film starts turning into a martial arts film. The fights here are very well choreographed and acted, though the camera goes on acid during these fight scenes. These fights are pretty bombastic, if illogical, with one guy, no joking, continuing his fight with two other guys after getting impaled in the neck by a wooden stake like it was nothing.The plot is simplistic, like Dredd, but nowhere near as satisfying and a lot of the major plot points are nonsensical, like there's a cop in the film who kills one of his fellow cops towards the end for no reason leaving you in a dumbfounding moment. The characters are faceless if anything. It's pretty easy to confuse like five of the cops for each other as they all look and act the same. The villains are worse, with no character or development throughout that isn't completely predictable (nothing like Dredd by the way). The ending is uneventful, and acts as you would expect for the most part (except when it bases logic on nonsense).At the end of the day, this is no amazing film. It's derivative, if pretty decent after the 30 minute mark. It has its \"oohhaho!\" moments, but at the end of the day, it's just another eh action film. As always, I recommend Kingsman or Equilibrium instead because they do action better than most action films in recent memory. The Raid: Redemption gets a 6.5/10.",

In this simple but effective story there were enough characters I got invested in, with their intense interaction in the hostile atmosphere being convincingly performed. Apart from feeling that some fighting scenes dragged on for too long I also often experienced genuine excitement to see the perilous situations unfold.The downside of the movie were a few moments wherein the emotional became melo-dramatic, especially in the flashback scene from the protagonist where he regains his focus. I don't necessarily dislike clich\u00e9s but it being depicted through hazy 'dream images' just felt a bit corny compared to the streak of killing i had already witnessed. Like a piece of soap in a bath of blood. I still enjoyed the acting overall and to hear the (vulgar!) and rapid use of the Indonesian language. In an unforeseen way i came to compare the movie to Game Of Thrones, sharing it's brutal violence and high deathtoll. The crucial difference to me is that The Raid feels it has to answer movie dogma: the protagonist will live. He has to. It gives the movie an air of predictability that somewhat lessened the impact of the convincing acting, effective story and countless crunching kicks and punches.",

            "content": "I read many raving reviews of The Raid so I was quite excited when I heard it was going to be released in my country. At first only at 7 or 8 theaters but a couple of weeks later all through the country and even in my city. So I bought a couple of beers and went to the cinema with very high expectations. The reviews told me that the story was quite weak but the action was really in your face, violent and realistic. I've seen many Asian flicks that are considered classics even though they have a weak or simplistic story so I wasn't worried by that criticism.The theater had about 20 people in it, not much but who cares when you are going to see the best Indonesian action movie ever, right? Well how could I be more wrong.There are many descent action scenes, gun fights and some martial arts but they are all f*cked up because of the camera man. That guy is literally shaking it up and down, left to right in a way that every bit of raw and realistic action is downgraded to a messy and typically modern Hollywood action scene. He even knows to f*ck up a simple scene like two actors having a conversation by shaking the camera from left to right in such an annoying manner you really want to hurt the man with the camera. The violence and blood shedding is incredible but I wasn't impressed because you won't see a thing because of the way they filmed it.You cannot have any compassion with any of the actors because they are all dull guys trying to survive their task of killing all the bad guys. (maybe some of the bad guys are alright) and when they throw in some sentimental typical Hollywood clich\u00e9s like \"the wife that is pregnant\" or \"that bad guy is actually my brother\" you know you've seen it before. (and far better) Asia has proved that they can make movies that can be commercially successful in the USA and Europe. Ong Bak did it for Thailand, The Rebel for Vietnam even Hong Kong put itself on the map again when releasing IP Man but this stinker doesn't give any credit to Indonesia cinema.During the movie I was thinking of the great movies Asia has made over 5 decades really pushing action cinema to the limits and always a step ahead of the movies made in Hollywood. The stunts of Jackie Chan, the sets of the old Shaw Brothers movies, modern South Korean thrillers, the realistic and violent fights by Tony Jaa, the stylish Japanese samurai flicks, well this film has nothing to be remembered by.Don't believe the hype and watch some old Barry Prima flicks instead. 50/100",

What's wrong with the movie? well for one it creates a lot of questions when you watch the movie where you can't help to go \"hey wait a minute\" before the movie tries to make you forget about it by giving you a fighting scene. Because that's what 'The Raid' is; a cut up fighting scene stitched by what appears to be an attempt to create drama. It's a story about a SWAT team that goes to an apartment to capture the kingpin that lurks on the top floor while slowly removing the tenants that happened to be armed and dangerous. Now, it has very terrific fighting scene and it's very well choreographed; in fact too well choreographed that it loses a sense of realism and is more similar to an 80s kungfu movie. These exact fighting scenes that leaves small room for character development, but tragically is poorly used. My only praise goes to Ray Sahetapy who plays the bad guy for being able to be in character and being taken seriously instead of the lead player who somehow makes people smirk when he talks his line. I know I have to somehow accept that the lead actor is there because he has martial arts skill but I couldn't help the feeling that the whole movie is highly influenced to accommodate these 'great' fighting scene. Example; for the setting of an apartment that's full of drug addicts and thugs, the room sure is big (5x5m) Which really makes you wonder why on earth would they have room those big if not to accommodate the movie equipment to shoot all the fighting going on in that room. As an Indonesian I accept the coming of 'The Raid' as a breath of fresh air to the movie industry that is currently filled with half soft-porn half horror flick. BUT, I couldn't help feeling that most Indonesian are taking this movie waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyy out of proportion. My two cents is this; besides the language used in the movie, this movie has nothing to do with Indonesia. It's not based on reality in Indonesia, It doesn't feel like it's in Indonesia, It doesn't represent anything Indonesia! At least in Ong Bak you could feel that this is a Thailand cinematic work of art. If you want to watch the raid, you can expect a great fighting scene; some that's even medically impossible but to expect a movie per se, don't let the 8.4 fools you.",

Iko uwais who play as main actor in this film was brilliant act in martial art that bring silat ( indonesian martial art ). Also the acting of yayan ruhian as fillain or bad gay ( mad Dog ) make me scared . Also don't forget about joe taslim in this film ( he won a gold medal in indonesian competition of judo ) . OK now i will tell about the story , the story about this movie is about group of Indonesia SWAT team that will raiding one apartment in jakarta . The apartment was loan to the many bad guy that no one police can touch that building . The building have 30 floor. Their mission was to capture the lord of drag ( TAMA acted by Ray Sahetapy ) . Tama have two loyal body guard . One of them is Mad Dog ( Really really the bad guy in this movie ) . Don't forget to see the duel between Mad Dog and Iko Also Mad Dog and Joe Taslim .

To that end the police break down the doors and basically kill anyone who gets in their way.The plot is paper-thin, and fairly humorless considering how over-the-top it is, and the violence is a bit too stabby in parts, for my taste; but this was a movie that grabbed my attention straight from the beginning, and would not let it go. Also, many of the fight scenes were spectacular. So, yeah, it was pretty cool, just not the sort of thing you would ever want to have happen in real life.",

The Action: To begin, the fight choreography is spectacular, with most characters using the south-east Asian martial art form, known as silat, mixed in with a healthy dose of old school brawling and some rather creative destruction (of both people and the environment). Each strike has weight and impact, and it's just shy of being considered gore hound material, just barely above realism. Story: You might figure that a balls to the wall action movie needs no elaborate plot, and both I, and The Raid: Redemption, would agree with you; but The Raid still provides more story than I was expecting, and though nothing particularly original or ground breaking, it serves it's purpose, sets the stakes, and allows for some excellent tension. Tension, by the way, is something that other action movies should take a lesson in, and that this one delivers scene for scene. The actors even give a great performance, all of them fully realizing the deadly situation their in, and acting appropriately. Their expressions, body language, and manner of speech all contribute to the viewer feeling more invested in the action scenes, which is what this movie is about.!!!GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!",

Seems like another boring rake on corruption vs nationalism types or one man army backed Ramboistic American wine resold in Indonesian bottle ? Well, then only you're being too imaginative from beginning.The story takes another turn when the Special Tactics Officers are cornered by the pets of Tama and reduced to mere five in number. Their struggle towards survival is the main focus of the movie. I don't remember last when I had to witness so pathetic retreat process by Special Forces. But corruption can let everything happen.The movie offers breath-taking moments of martial arts in many fight sequences, and those are shot with pro efficiency. Especially Mad Dog's ones. The music is equally thumping. Camera is apt for such thematic movie, and few dialogues are very economical, like \"Just because you see what I do as wrong doesn't mean I can't be good at it\" by Andi, the brother to Rama. The movie may discourage the audience about the internal corruption inside the system, but it also mentions that there may exist people like Andi, who loves to work for good despite being heavily indulged into crime ; or the mention of officer Bunawar, who despite enjoying a higher rank, doesn't sell himself for money .",

Boom, the most stupid screenplay ever, boring scenes where good guys fight against bad ones.Poor imitation of Hollywood (which I don't like) and Bruce Lee (LOL) style.There is several nice fighting moves, but they repeat all the time, and is becoming painfully boring to watch it as movie goes along.Plot is really plain and very simple, other than fighting there is nothing happening here.Aldo I don't love Bruce Lee or Chuck Norris movies, I have to admit that they are far better than this one.Final mark: 2/10 - Only thing I don't understand about this film, is how come that it has so many positive reviews when there is absolutely NOTHING interesting in it.

When the good guys have guns, all the bad guys will show up with guns as well. And just when the antagonists run out of guns suddenly the protagonists seem to be short on guns as well.The action sequences are performed well, but seem to lack logic and therefore look unrealistic (3 machete weilding bad guys in a 4 feet wide blocked corridor; the chances of surviving even for Bruce Lee would be pretty slim). Not that there are any realistic action sequences even in highly acclaimed action movies but some are more annoying than others, and this one is pretty annoying.For me it's just a 3/10.",

I couldn't believe some of the stunts!Neither sensible or clever, but it never needs to be. The Raid Redemption is fast, cool, and brilliant in its stunts. One of the best action films ever made and one of the best flicks this year.This is not one of those films one watches for its impeccable narrative or picturesque scenarios. 'The Raid: Redemption' promises and delivers one thing: heart-pounding, fast-paced action scenes, with some virtual gore sprinkled-in by director-Evans for a maximal adrenalizing experience. If you are an avid fan of Pinkaew's 'Ong-bak', Chan-wook's 'Oldboy' or Tarantino's 'Django Unchained', rest assured that this film will undoubtedly tug at your heartstrings.",

Good guy, goatee guy, and grey haired guy go in a building to fight many, many bad guys and an end boss. A decade ago this may have been alright, but these days we can go onto YouTube and see fights like this for free.Since this movie is all action, I have to say that from a technical standpoint it is very good. There's no wires, no CGI, no shaky \"Can't tell what the hell is going on\" camera work, no quick cutting, and no speeding up of the action in post production. The action is sometimes inventive and the combatants are very good and very fast. There is a particularly exciting action scene early in the movie involving an axe.But the action is non-stop - meaning I wanted it to stop but it didn't. Everyone appears to practice the exact same style of martial arts - its not like Tony Jaa films where you can see the different art forms. The main characters survive dozens upon dozens of kicks and punches to the head, and afterwards it's like nothing happened to them. And the action is sometimes quite gruesome, which could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your taste.Overall I was disappointed with the movie, and I'm surprised the movie received such a high amount of praise.",

The fights are so well choreographed, all the strikes, be it with the, hands, legs or weapons seem like they actually have weight behind them and hurt. There are some pretty brutal scenes, so I do not recommend watching this with the average girlfriend/wife because mine didn't enjoy it at all due to the graphic, well shot, in your face violence. It's bloody as all hell and I will never look at a fluorescent tube the same way. The story is ricepaper thin, it's functional, just there to give the characters some motivation but it doesn't really need one. The story is almost exactly the same as Dredd, locked in a building full of gang members looking to kill the swat team that wanted to Raid them. The swat team gets almost completely wiped out in a short time making Rama (Iko Uwais) having to fight his way to the top of the building, to find the man they came for, a gang leader/slum lord and arrest him, in order to unlock the building allowing the few men left a chance to escape with their lives. That's it, a synopsis of the entire plot, there are some twists along the way but that's the gist of it. It's not very story driven, and that's fine. This is like very violent fast food, it'll satisfy your hunger, but anything consumed directly after it seems less tasty. It has some tense scenes that are pretty ingenious, like hiding behind a fake wall while some gang member is randomly ramming a machete in it looking for the few surviving swat members, or a pitch black stairwell where some heavily armed gang members are just a few feet away from the swat team, on different floors listening and watching for any sign of movement or sound to open up on them. This movie knows how to create tension and does it very well by keeping the pace pretty slow during these scenes, it ramps up dramatically during the hand to hand fights which are some of the best fights you'll see in a movie period! This movie did ruin the John Wick movies for me, the fist John Wick still holds up pretty well compared to this, but those sequels don't. Both of \"The Raid\" movies are just more visceral, dirty and raw than those. So if you like unflinching violence, actors that are real fighters and non stop action this is the movie for you, just don't make it the first action movie of the evening if you plan a movie night, because almost every action movie will seem kinda tame, or slow after this.",

            "content": "The Raid is one of the most engaging Action films ever made, featuring a very simple but very effective premise, excellent lighting and cinematography, absolutely amazing fight/shootout sequences and a strong dedication of Show-Don't-Tell storytelling.  What makes this film unique is that it's the only Action movie I can think of that plays out almost like a Horror film -- There have been Action/Horror films in the past, but all other examples I can think of are Horror films that play out with loads of Action, rather than an Action movie that often times plays out like a Horror film.  The Characters are in a situation more bleak than I can think of when compared to virtually any other Action film, and because of this, the Action sequences play out with an unparalleled vigor and desperation, and this makes them far more brutal than almost any other Action film I can think of.  The hero, played by the charismatic Iko Uwais, fights like a trapped animal doing things like slashing attackers' legs and arms open to take them out the equation as quickly as possible, as he is assaulted in all directions in a few sequences, so this works narratively as well as cathartically, and the fact that it's all executed by groups of people that perform it in such a complex manner with perfect timing makes it worth seeing if just because each fight, like classic Jackie Chan fights, are almost like multi-person Rube Goldberg machines.  And that is why I recommend this movie to everyone -- If you don't appreciate it for the intense atmosphere or the brutal and satisfying action, then you can at least appreciate the craftsmanship behind the film's execution, and the fact that this was made for $6M only makes it more impressive (for reference, Justice League, on average, cost $2.5M per minute of runtime..).  It's intense, it's fast-paced, it has some good twists and it leaves you incredibly satisfied, especially upon subsequent re-watchings.",

            "content": "The most brutal action film this decade.\n\nGareth Evans' Indonesian action crime thriller The Raid (2011) is an insane festival of carnage. Evans' direction is impeccable as he rivets you with creative ways to shoot essentially one long action sequence within one apartment complex. Evans' direction takes you on a police raid into a crime lord's hideout building, cutting between extended hand to hand combat and outrageous shootouts in equal violent splendor. The Raid is super entertaining and an intense watch. Gareth Evans' editing actually makes sure that The Raid does not waste a single minute of its solid 101 minutes with his slick barebones crime drama that leads to endless fights.\n\nI have to hand it to the entire stunt team for The Raid for pulling off the two against one fight in the meat locker that goes on and on with unbelievable athleticism and intensity. It's been years since I've seen action scenes as exciting, cool, and dangerous as The Raid. You'd have to watch the John Wick series or classic Jackie Chan Police Story films for such exhilarating action. You really need to see The Raid.\n\nIko Uwais is incredible as the fit, young police recruit who ends up single handedly taking on scores of bad guys in unreal knife and hand to hand combat sequences. His martial arts are very impressive, similar to Donnie Yen or Tony Jaa. Joe Taslim is great as the police commander Jaka with a crazy hand to hand choreographed sequence against the fearsome Yayan Ruhian's Mad Dog. Yayan is outstanding and the standout actor in The Raid. His villain Mad Dog is so fast, ferocious, and exhausting that you are amazed that he can pull off absurdly fast kicks and punches. He's jaw dropping in The Raid. Donny Alamsyah is equally impressive as the fierce Andi with brutal fights.\n\nMatt Flannery and Dimas Imam Subhono's cinematography is awesome as I don't know how they managed to film any of the fight sequences in The Raid. The close up hand held camera makes you feel like you are stuck in this hectic building with the cops, while the steady camera shots down hallways are very pretty and engaging. The fast wide shots during combat is stunning with excellent editing from Gareth Evans for the fights.\n\nI have to mention that it is extremely cool that Gareth Evans got Mike Shinoda from Linkin Park to compose the score for The Raid. His blend of hip hop, industrial, electronica, and classical work wonders for the suspense and intensity of The Raid's atmosphere.\n\nStop whatever you are doing and watch The Raid!",

The fights are, generally, good enough to carry the picture single-handedly.

There's a jarring sense of harsh finality to The Raid, with a steady stream of weaponry in play and every duel culminating in a killing or crippling blow. There's no limping off, bruised ribs in-hand, to fight another day... these guys are visibly finished.\n\nIn lieu of a deeper, less generic plot, it's that brutal efficiency which gives the film its identity.

            "content": "The Raid is a movie about a SWAT team that goes on a mission to infiltrate an apartment complex controlled by a drug dealer. This ultimately proves to be a dangerous, possibly suicidal mission for them all. It is very light on plot, because other than one kid who\u2019s new to the team and his connection with someone in the building, there isn\u2019t much to the story beyond what I described. However, the movie isn\u2019t all about story, it\u2019s all about action. The Raid moves at a break-neck pace, as we are bouncing from one brutal Kung Fu fight to the next. The fight choreography is stellar, and Iko Uwais is a force to be reckoned with. I appreciate that he was powerful in a fight, but it also felt like he was fallible and might not survive, so there was always a risk factor. The other actor who stood out was Yayan Ruhian who plays a ruthless killer nicknamed Mad Dog. His intensity was a sight to behold, and he almost sold me on the tired clich\u00e9 of a man who wants to kill with his bare hands even when he has someone dead to rights with a gun. It seems somewhat obvious that Alex Garland cribbed some things from this film when he wrote the screenplay for Dredd that came out the following year. Both have a similar setup, but I actually preferred what Dredd did slightly more. I thought that film utilized the setting and had better variety in the threats they faced. While the fights in The Raid are awesome, it is almost all a flurry of punches and kicks which can start to feel like you\u2019re watching a video game instead of a film with a story. It\u2019s a great game, though. My only other complaint with The Raid is the ending. I was hoping for a satisfying conclusion to wrap it all up, or a surprising reveal that changed the nature of the entire film. It didn\u2019t deliver on that, instead it was a fairly straightforward ending and a somewhat bland send-off for our heroes. But none of my problems with the film were significant because the movie accomplished what it was aiming to do. The Raid is a thrilling film that takes you on a brutal journey and leaves you practically out of breath at the end, as if you had been involved in some of the action too.",

One minute in and our main character is punching, elbowing and kicking a sand bag at 100mph. Bam! I was ready to sit back and watch a heck load of hand combat unfold. 40 minutes later, still no hand combat scenes...I was growing agitated. Thankfully though, the film turned around and our main character was battling his way through using only his body and knives. I'm talking full annihilation. Complete decimation. The residents did not stand a chance! Wham! Bam! Kapow! Swish! Slice! Followed by continuous noises as our characters fights to death. \"Ah! Ehh! Phwoarrr! Hai! Ohhh!\"...you get the gist. The action is pretty relentless, well executed and rapid. The choreography is insane. INSANE! There is one scene where two good guys are against one bad guy (apologies for the bland description) that goes on for six minutes. I have never seen so much flipping, kicks to the head, jump punches and head smashes to the floor...in my life. The bad guy in that scene is like the Indonesian Terminator, he just wouldn't die. The directing was good overall, not many quick cuts although the camera was particularly shaky during the first half. My problems with the film are with the plot conveniences and predictability. I don't really want to dive into it for spoiler reasons but if our main character is in a tricky situation, something would always happen to get him out. Any \"twists\" that were executed, were predictable and poorly constructed. Also some fight scenes in rooms have all the furniture right next to the walls, therefore leaving a massive open space for the fight. I would like to have seen them use the furniture to their advantage. Plus, I literally just watched it and don't know the main character's name. At all. Greatest action movie ever?

In fact, only hearing about it because of the hype that came after. You could easily been mistaken and think it's a martial art version of Pete Travis' Dredd in 2012 but no, The Raid was released some months before. In fact, the Dredd film was already in production before The Raid, by four months, but The Raid Director didn't get wind of their story until they were already in post-production. I still think of this as a recent release, like a couple of years old and yes, it kinda is but I actually find it hard to believe this came out before Dredd, and that was five years ago! \n\nIt's not the first to receive such after-hype success either. The Thai film Ong Bak and the French parkour film District 13 that both came out in 2003 both probably received greater admiration after their general releases, once the hype had got around. District 13 even getting a poor American remake as Brick Mansions. This film has some slight similarities to District 13 in terms of premise, and of you haven't seen it yet I suggest you add it to your watchlist if you're an action junkie. \n\nWhat is different from the above mentioned films, is the person behind the camera. Different being he's not native to the film's country of origin, that being Indonesia. Gareth Evans is a Welsh director, writer and screenwriter who graduated from the University of Glamorgan with a MA in scriptwriting for Film and Television who went on to receive high acclaim for his short film Footsteps which got awarded best film at the Swansea Bay Film Festival in 2006. His next project was a documentary about Pencak Silat, the recognised fighting style of Indonesia and this is where he met  the stars his next venture, his main feature in Indonesia, Merantau in 2009. And then, the Welshman brings us this. \n\nYou can tell Evans is a massive fan and great appreciator of the genre, his vision being perfect using clever and intense angles that increases the tension. The suspense is almost borderline horror when waiting to be discovered. I remember actually holding my breath during specific scenes. \n\nThe premise seems simple and done before, about a elite police task force carrying out a raid on a building block that is protected by the inhabitants of thugs and gangsters, and it's crime lord Tama, played by legendary Indo actor, Ray Sahetapy, who lives on the top floor. He's the target for their mission, but ends up as some crazy, brutal fight for survival. Our protagonist is Rama, of the elite police agents played superbly by Iko Uwais showing incredible skill that appears to rival other kung fu greats like Jet Li or Tony Jaa. Yes, we've seen it before with films like Die Hard or Under Siege and though Evans had more aspirations for the film, time and budget was a major factor. So, a single location was ideal. \n\nIt looks like a typical martial art, kung fu flick on the surface, but Evans' use of camera angles and the editing actually boast more of the western style of fighting films. There's no double takes like we see in Jackie Chan or Jet Li films which emphasises what's going on but instead it's more like the Bourne films where the fighting is furiously fast and violent. Editing in the traditional Hong Kong  style would have only ruined the overall effect. The camera work here is astonishing, creating seamlessly, fluid sequences which must have taken quite some planning and choreographing. There's running shots, rotation shots, close-ups, overhead and tracking shots all perfectly captured and cut together. There's some slow-mo, but again, it's used to create a different effect of looming death as oppose to exaggerating action.\n\nThe fighting is some of the best I've ever seen on screen, and I've seen a fair amount of decent fight scenes. And there's more than a few incredible sequences worth a mention. The initial corridor brawl, the coke factory fight and especially Mad Dog's fights. They're so fast but still perfectly lucid making each blow make it's impact, but this could be because the fighting is real, yes choreographed, but because of time and budget again being a factor, many fight sequences meant the stars actually going for it; mostly without protection. \n\nMad Dog is played by Yayan Ruhian who incidentally taught Pencak Silat, the Indonesian martial art, to both the Indonesian military police corps and the presidential security forces in his younger years, also helped choreographed this film along side Uwais and Evans. You can't doubt the man's talent and his character reminds me greatly of John Woo's Mad Dog in Hard Boiled. Possibly the most lethal and dangerous character, an antagonist, but has a code and a strong sense of honour about him. \n\nIko Uwais wasn't an actor when he met Evans whilst during them researching for the Silat documentary. He was a telephone salesman who happened to be one of the students practising. Evans and his wife was so impressed they approached him and the rest is history. Talk about being in the right place at the right time. \n\nThe rest of the cast are superb, with a mention of Joe Taslim who plays the police sarge. Some of you might recognise him from Fast 6 as one of Shaw's henchmen, the one that fights Roman and Han at the London train station. This is definitely a film that has got these people noticed, and rightly so. Uwais and Ruhian even got cameos in The Force Awakens as space pirates. \n\nThere's actually a little more to the film than just bloody violence. There's a working storyline offering a little more than the basic raid premise. Some sibling rivalry, some interesting characters and even a slight sting but seriously, it's all about the action that just doesn't let you catch your breath. \n\nAlso what really works here is the score, a collaboration between Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda and Joseph Trapanese. The music really gives the film a great essence of suspense and heightens as the violence increases to an eventual bloody climax. It's certainly one of the most noticeable scores for an action film of this calibre. \n\nIt's an immediate classic that deserves all the praise of gets. Plus, I see it as a great tribute to the Martial Art genre. \n\nRunning Time: 9\nThe Cast: 9\nPerformance: 9\nDirection: 9\nStory: 8\nScript: 7\nCreativity: 9\nSoundtrack: 9\nJob Description: 10\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 10 for being a total refreshing addition to the Martial Art genre. \n\n89% 9/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",

We follow an Indonesian SWAT team as they break into a fortress-like tenement building that is home to a notorious criminal/drug dealer.  Once the action starts, it never lets up - hundreds of baddies pour out of every doorway and stream down every hall.  The ultra-violence quotient is cranked up impossibly high - blood spurts and squirts everywhere and the martial arts fighting (Pencak Silat) is rough and brutal; this film is not for the squeamish.  However, you'll probably find yourself thinking more about the stunt coordinator and the mechanics of making the action look realistic than worrying about the real hurts involved.  Still, the ruthlessness is a downside for me, as I much prefer the Jacky Chan-style of fighting film with some comic relief thrown in for good measure.  Then I can enjoy the choreography without grimacing too much.  Here, the relentlessness can be rather grinding (and the thumping soundtrack heightens the effect); you also have to wonder (and worry?) whether there are people who get off on the violence of it all.  Nevertheless, if you are looking for a visceral rush and can look past the broken bones and machetes to the throat, this is a taut action film.",

            "content": "Martial arts has always been a fascination to the world at least in the movies since Bruce Lee's foray into Hollywood. The same enthusiasm has been carried forward by Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Tony Jaa and the likes in their own style while adapting to changing times. Thus far, the primary combination has always been that of martial arts, modern technology and modern crime world along with a healthy dose of PG entertainment thrown in with occassional fantasy setups and animation. With 'The Raid: Redemption', it is taken to a whole new territory of gore, grit and overall graphic violence which marks a definitive shift in its target audience while putting the Indonesian movie industry in the global map of cinema along the way.\n\nRama (Iko Uwais) is a rookie in the tactical police team which has been assigned to engage a crime syndicate operating from an apartment building. The team is led by Jaka (Joe Taslim) based on the intel procured from Wahyu (Pierre Gruno) and the operation was expected to be quick and silent. The mob boss Tama (Ray Sahetapy), his muscle Mad Dog (Yayan Ruhian) and brain Andi (Donny Alamsyah) along with a huge network of spotters (generally children), surveillance cameras and mercenaries was underestimated by the tactical team. The whole operation goes downhill as soon as it starts with body count rising and a never ending barrage of bad guys popping up in every corner. Rama and Wahyu have their own agenda amid all the chaos. Can they make it out alive?\n\nYou get a similar scenario as that of 'Black Hawk Down' where a large and sophisticated military team go into Somalia for a quick and clean mission but end up losing many men and the rest scared and desperate to get back in one piece. 'The Raid' isn't about getting back in one piece but to pursue on relentlessly and at the same time playing for the masses every opportunity it gets. The graphic violence and the gore is on another level compared to movies of this genre. Even though there are a lot of gun battles, there are even more fist and knife fights which is where things get murkier. Skulls crushed, arms and legs broken, spines twisted, jaws cracked, torsos slashed and blood everywhere. Definitely not your average action movie. \n\nConsidering the entire story is just the movie's namesake - a raid, even though the twists, revelations, human relationships etc. are all projected with the right intensity and strategically timed - it is the visual display of those martial arts combined with graphic violence that wins big for it. The action choreography is very innovative where the kicks and punches come in lightening pace and bodies are crushed in ways a normal viewer wouldn't have imagined. Complementing it is the excellent cinematography where each kick and punch is captured and projected with the maximum intensity for genre audience's pleasure. Generally the acting in Asian movies are a little overboard, but 'The Raid' makes sure the standard is very different from normal by maintaining the correct tone and the actors are to be commended for it. With a short runtime, crisp screenplay and enough twists in the script to keep the viewer engaged, the movie is a complete package for whoever can stomach the gore and violence.\n\nNot your average martial-art themed action flick, but every other can become a child's play after seeing this.",

The movie clocks in at 1 hour 40 minutes and has action for over an hour.

The overall story of the movie is a bit unoriginal and doesn't really keep you guessing, with the exception of a plot twist towards the end of the movie, but it's kinda what you would expect from a movie like this. I gave this movie four and a half stars because even though it has at best a decent story with a even better cast, it accomplishes it's goal to a tee by being a bad-ass movie.

Their orders, to take down crime lord Tama. It sounds simple enough but Tama offers a safe haven for any notorious and dangerous criminal who can pay along with the civillian residents.  So almost everyone in the building is ready to stop the incoming force.  When most of the team are eliminated it falls to Rama to find a way out back out of the building alive.  Rama also has a vested interest and is in no rush to escape.\nIt sounds mad to say that this is directed by a welsh man, Evans, and set in Indonesia but it works brilliantly.  As most of the reviews say it really is non stop action from start to finish.  it's jam packed with gun fights, knife attacks and some extremely dynamic martial arts sequences.  Yes some of the violence may seem over the top but it's totally at home here.  The movie only lulls briefly from the action to build tension into the next succession of action.\nSuperbly made with a decent but not over complicated plot The Raid rages across the screen and is fully entertaining.  The sequel will have a lot to do just to match the body count!",

            "content": "''The Raid: Redemption'' is an indonesian made martial arts/action thriller that is all about violence. All violence. Wall-to-wall violence. Against many of those walls, heads are pounded again and again into a pulpy mass. If I estimated the film has 15 minutes of dialogue, i think i would be generous. \nBut then again, what does my opinion matter, it is highly rated on every movie critic site on the planet and it is hailed as a breakthrough for martial arts.\nI dont mind violence at all, nor do i mind a movie that tells its story visually, but the director (Gareth Evans) doesnt take the effort to make it a well-made film, it's basically 100 minutes of non stop action, with no plot, no characters, barely any dialogue, and just constant hard-driving, butt-kicking, pulse-pounding, bone-crunching, skull-smashing, bloodcurdling and largely a hand-to-hand, fist-to-face, foot-to-groin battle, with a few machetes and guns tossed in for good measure. Which is a formula Evans clearly knows is a large audience for, hence the obviously high ratings, and movies like this just dont entertain me at all. It's basically you watching a well-made realistic martial arts mission-type video game.\n\nDetailed criticism: Why does the movie establishes that the ''lead role'' is a muslim in the beginning of the film? They do nothing at all with it after the opening scene. It seems pointless, except as a cheap, failed attempt in some sort of character development. But it is pointless to even attempt at something like that, no one in the film has a personality, they are all relentless fighters with no brain in their heads. \nAnother cheap plot point that was extremely predictable: one of the gangsters that is helping the drug lord that is camping out in this massive squat, is Rama's brother (The ''leading man''). Thus it is ofcourse inevitable that they eventually will hold each other's lives in their hands and resolve deep childhood feelings to their satisfaction at the end of the film, and that they obviously both survive and go their ways in the end...\nLike i said, ''The Raid: Redemption'' is basically a well-made video game: a ruthless fighter stands in a corridor and destroys an enemy. As the enemy falls, another jumps into position from around corner, ready to be destroyed in turn. Then another, and another. It's like they're being ejected by an automatic victim dispenser.\nAnother small detail: What the hell does \"Redemption\" mean in the title? Who, or what, is redeemed, and how? If you kill lots of people and are still alive, have you been redeemed? If you and your brother don't kill each other after almost everyone else does, is that redemption? Or is \"redemption\" just one of those title words like \"reloaded\" or \"destiny\" to help people tell movies apart? Seems a bit stupid in my humble opinion, but i think i read somewhere that Gareth Evans is making the third installment of the Raid trilogy (yay) and he said that the 3rd film will take place before the first ''Raid'', so probably something will happen in that film that needs redeeming..\n\nAnother thing, this movie is inconsistent and unrealistic as hell, not just because something ridiculous like this would NEVER happen, but also because most people they ''kill'' go down by just getting kicked in the stomach, or getting slammed into a wall, or getting dropped on a table, and then there is a final fight with ''Mad Dog'' where he continues to fight for at least 5 minutes whilst having a fluorecent tube stuck in his neck, and before that he's been kicked and punched to absolute pulp. But he just continues to fight. \nIt's inconsistent as hell\n\nThe only reason i gave it a 2/5 instead of giving it lower, is simply because, i can't deny that the stunts and fight choreography isnt fantastic, and the way they killed (some) people was quite creative.\n\nAll in all, movies like this simply dont entertain me, no depth, no story, no characters and just constant neck-breaking action, but that's what it's meant to be. Something like this just doesnt quite suit me.\nCan't dare expect the redemption from the sequel for what I found lacking here. Yet I guess I'll give it a go. (yay)\n\"The Raid: Redemption\" will be most successful for people with A.D.D. or just generally short attention spans, but then again, that's what it's aimed at.",

This is Pencak Silat, a unique and brutal knife fighting technique developed in the island regions from which they hail. I must admit I had never heard of it before I saw this movie, and most of my martial arts film collection focuses mainly on Japanese and Chinese cinema with a few Thai films here or there, but this one blew me away.\n\nThe story is about a SWAT team entering a small and dilapidated apartment complex run by one of Jakarta's most brutal drug lords. Every resident is a victim, dealer, or criminal, and every room is rented. They are here under the command of their Lieutenant, in a 20 person unit headed to the top floor to bring down the leader of this loose organization and bring him to justice, or so they think. You are introduced to Rama at the beginning, a man who trains hard, has a wife, a police officer and SWAT unit member with some experience. He has heart, and you get that right from the start, but there is something about him that he hasn't told anyone is his unit, and it's a secret he must keep. The leader of the unit is head strong and sure fire, but things don't go as planned and what follows is a non-stop battle of knives, guns and fists throughout.\n\nThis movie is a absolute must for actions fans. Even if you don't like foreign cinema, this movie has a lot to teach Hollywood in terms of how you don't need a huge budget to create a fantastic film. Interestingly enough, the movie 'Dredd' (2012) with Karl Urban, came out about a year later. Some critics noticed the similarity in plot between the two films, with 'The Raid-Redemption'(2011) only coming out only a year before. The plot devices are so similar, that the movies could have been interchangeable if not for the characters, time-line, and budget. If you watch those films back to back (I did), you might be surprised at just how these two movies match up in terms of story, events, and theme. Both have cops raiding and apartment, both have drug lords ordering the residents to go after the cops, both films have their character's allegiances tested in similar ways, and both have a floor by floor filming style as they ascend their way to the top level.\n\nAlthough not known for it's movie production and cinematic influence (outside of a few notable documentaries), Indonesia has a lot to be proud of with this film. This one proudly stands right up there at the top. I would certainly love to see more of these actors and their unique style of fighting come out of their homeland.\n\nNon-stop Action From Start to Finish.\n\n4/5",

Run by a ruthless drug kingpin, its not long before the halls are littered with with his army of killers and thugs. \n\nGareth Evan's noisy blood lusting crowd pleaser is a stylistic throwback to the grind house genre. It is expertly paced with ferocious tenacity. Evan's never runs out of inventive ways to kill somebody. \n\nA little late to the party with this one... let's not lie, we all have that list of movies that we know we should have seen, but haven't yet. Action is a tricky genre to hold my interest, most times I find it becomes repetitive and uninteresting. Fortunately, The Raid does not fall into that trap. The Raid is a true triumph of marital arts choreography, the camera work dances around the fight sequences in long wide combative takes. The scores pulsing synth does well to play embellish the playful use of set design allows the camera to impressively follow the action everywhere it goes - dropping through floors, circling around doorways and walls. \n\nThe plot is simple enough, get in, get out. It doesn't weigh down what the film is really about. A showcase of the impressive martial art of pencak silat. My only question for the film would be in the title itself. The Raid: Redemption? Who or what is redeemed? \n\nThe Raid: Redemption is brutal and bloody. So relentless in its action, it's a never ending visual spectacle.",

Sadly my enthusiasm for that film was eclipsed when I learned it basically stole everything from this, now famous, Indonesian action film. While the villain in this film is a bit underwhelming, the action is brutal and terse throughout. The setting is a giant apartment complex, full of impoverished tenants, tens of hit men, and a small army of police officers. Every action sequence includes intense bouts of kung Fu fighting, gunplay, and gruesome violence. What set this apart from other action films is its use of setting in the action, and the sadness of the characters' impotence in the face of this huge, immovable villain. He really is underwhelming, because the film starts with the raid itself, and gives very little background as to why he must be taken down. Still, watching the fighting by the main officers, and knowing the stakes for them to get out alive, really drove the action forward. A must watch for those who want to see where good action films are going in the next couple of years.",

The Story follows a young man named Rama, who is the newest edition to a SWAT team tasked with raiding a run down apartment complex in order to bust a powerful crime lord. Shit hits the fan, and soon the team finds themselves in an all out slaughter between themselves and the swarming army of thugs and killers. The story is incredibly fast paced, wasting no time introducing the characters, and throwing you straight into the action. One would think that this would sacrifice character development and emotion, but it honestly doesn't feel like it. Through the entire affair, you'll remember the character's faces, and root for them the entire way. The action sequences are completely mind-blowing. Not in their SFX, but just in the sheer grit and brutality they display. Everything is extremely well choreographed and shot, WITH NO SHAKY CAM! I didn't even know it was possible at this point to have a fight scene with smooth, beautiful cinematography, that actually allows you to see the action on screen. It's enough to move any action junky to tears.\nBottom line, if you're an action movie fan, then this is a must see. This little film puts most of its blockbuster HollyWood counterparts to shame.",

Bad guys in a building, on many floors, and their boss lives in the penthouse suite. Sure there's some extra intrigue involving corrupt police, and siblings working on both sides of the law, but at the end of the day, The Raid is mostly about the action!\n\nOn that front, this film is quite frankly amazing, and is clearly a movie made by an avid fan of the action and martial arts genres. Writer, director, film editor, fight choreographer and Everton* supporter! Gareth Evans has clearly taken a look around at the shoddy action offerings we've had to endure over the years and said, 'enough!' He's crafted a simple yet effective narrative that allows for all forms of mutilation and mayhem, then simply let his talented performers and stunt people do their thing.\n\nI loved how the hand-held camera work panned and snapped into place over the action, and how the fight sequences were intelligently edited to allow each martial artist time to demonstrate their skills. There was a great artistry to how each set piece developed too. First the quiet before the storm, as the players in the next battle assemble and take their positions. All this is beautifully lit too by the way, as we wait for the spark that will ignite the action. On one occasion, that spark was an ultra slow-motion blast from a shotgun, and the way it exposed a group of police officers as shadows against a wall, right before all bloody hell broke loose, was just amazing to watch.\n\nI would also be remiss not to mention the lead in this fantastic film, Iko Uwais. Amazing to watch in the film's many fight scenes, Iko also brings a great vulnerability to his role as the honest cop, in over his head. He's someone you can root for, which makes all his hard-fought victories, and this film, that much more satisfying.\n\n* Everton Football Club, England.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nIf you're an action and martial arts film fan, then I think you're going to really enjoy this film. For those that care less about this genre, expect rapid well filmed inventive action and brutal violence. This movie most certainly wears its R rated badge with pride!\n\nBest Format:\n\nThis is a great film to watch in the theater, but at home a HD viewing on a nice big TV is the way to go. It would be a great film to watch with friends too. Watching this on a laptop, tablet or phone is not advised.\n\nBest Moment:\n\nCertainly the close quarter action scenes are the main reason to see this film, and out of those, I really enjoyed the sequence in the drug lab. There's a great battle involving the character Mad Dog a little later on, but the lab sequence really used the space well, and provided plenty of walls and props to use as weapons!\n\n\nhttp://talkiegazette.com/the-raid-redemption-2012/\n\nhttp://facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\nhttp://twitter.com/talkiegazette",

Definitely the most bad ass Asian action flick of 2012.I mean it has the most intense and brutal close quarter combat in a film. A nail bitter, very gripping, bone crunching and \"on the edge of the seat\" moments that has an intense action scenes that you had never seen before. It's hard to watch sometimes. Like for instance, the chopping scenes where the knife daggers beneath thru others body parts. And you can still hear its sound. It's violent as hell. The only issues I can see throughout are those shaky cams, it would be better if they use steady cams instead. It's more of an action rather telling its story, yet the actors are good in acting in terms of dramatization. The action scenes are well choreograph with well made executions of martial arts moves. For action movie aficionados, this will feed your apatite 100%. 4.5/5.",

            "content": "\"The Raid: Redemption\", director Gareth Evans' sophomore effort, is a knockout. Featuring some intense, high-stakes action sequences, \"The Raid\" succeeds at delivering thrills. In turn, it establishes itself as one of the finest action films ever made.\n\nAs the film begins, we are quickly introduced to rookie cop Rama, whose wife is pregnant with their first child. We soon learn that his S.W.A.T team has been assigned to take down one of Jakarta's most ruthless crime lords. The elite group of cops quickly (and silently) begin to raid the crime lord's apartment building, but they are soon discovered and one exciting, extended action sequence unfolds before our eyes.\n\nFor starters, the film is captured perfectly by some impressive camera work, which always helps to keep us in the midst of the action. The background music also adds to the tension and is never distracting. The editing is also top-notch as well, which is unlike many of today's action films. All too often, the editing in these films will slack and the action scenes will become an incomprehensible mess. Thankfully, that is not the case in \"The Raid.\"\n\nThe film's only weak spot, however, is its plot, which is a bit half-baked. As a result, there is minimal character development. Despite this, the cast still does well with their roles. However, the story isn't what made us watch \"The Raid\" in the first place. It's the fight scenes that caught our attention, and boy, do they deliver. Throughout the majority of the film, we witness gunfights, martial arts showdowns, and brutal takedowns. Expertly choreographed, the action scenes are viscerally intense and highly entertaining. Our hero Rama (Iko Uwais, operational driver turned actor), is the star here and he delivers throughout, dispatching thug after thug using the Malaysian martial arts technique \"pencak silat.\"\n\nAll in all, \"The Raid\" is one of the best action films ever released. Despite a mediocre plot, it succeeds at delivering thrills with its impressive camera work, mesmerizing choreography, and brutal and relentless action scenes. It might not appeal to everyone due to its intensity and carnage, but for action aficionados, this is sure to be a treat.\n\n9/10",

The action is relentless and the film contains some amazing, close up fight choreography; some of the best I've seen quite a while. I also loved that the plot is not overly complicated, nor the characters overly cheesy and clich\u00e9. It doesn't try to be anything than what it is; a thoroughly entertaining, bare bones action film. I recently watched Dredd (2012) an while it was a similar concept, it was no where near as well executed as this.

Many parts of this film are full of cliches, and use them as character development. Though they can be tedious, it did really work. You can't go into this movie, expecting a great story like the Shawshank Redemption or Taxi Driver, it's almost a completely straight up action flick, with some elements of the thriller/horror genre, due to it's straight up brutal fight scenes. What I got with this action movie was a claustrophobic, intense, and glorifying experience. Though I've seen many of it's cliched story elements before, the uniqueness of this movie strives in it's action, which really makes up for it's faults and makes this one of the most enjoyable viewing that I have had the pleasure to see in a while.

The late great Roger Ebert was one of the few critics who gave this film a scathingly negative review, and that's because for him films didn't just need to work within their perspective genres; they needed to work as artistic and meaningful statements about the human experience.

            "content": "Classic kung fu action films of the 1970's were a brilliant mix of expertly crafted choreography and intense action. It is since become a lost art form due to the complications of filming such intense one on one combat between actors. While these satirical kung fu films had exhilarating fight, they largely lacked an emotional core or even a decent story not ridden with clich\u00e9s. Fortunately there are still action directors today who are up to the excruciating challenge of constructing these incredibly difficult to shoot kung fu films. Director Gareth Evans truly understands how to construct several minute long fight sequences between actors that are not only visually appealing but also undeniably compelling to watch. Often many kung fu films of old as well as some more recent films, have filmed there action scenes in one take, which is, as you can imagine, one of the most difficult things a director can shoot. Evans rarely keeps the camera on his actors for more than ten seconds due to the constant pace of the film which is always continuous; he instead opts for dangerously close framing of his scenes with his actors, as they relentlessly cover each other with bruises and cuts. Undoubtedly the stand out sequence of the film is the fight in which Rama, played by Iko Uwais, is backed up in a corner and must face down four men with machetes. Because the film never abandons all of its realism, the fight is truly an on the edge of your seat, nerve racking experience for its nearly five minute run time. This fight perfectly shows off the skill of the actors, the majesty of the choreography and the expertise of Evans blocking, lighting, framing and overall direction. Obviously because The Raid: Redemption is a foreign language film, there are two mass produced versions of the film, the English Dubbed version and the English subtitled version. Like many foreign language films that were dubbed in English, the dubbing for The Raid: Redemption is simply awful because of the overacted voice work that in no way matches the characters themselves or correctly syncing with the actors lips; the experience of viewing this film will be far better if it is viewed as it was originally intended. Surprisingly the film also comes with two different soundtracks, the original score and the American Lincoln Park produced soundtrack; again the original soundtrack is far superior because it fits the atmosphere and tone much better compared to Lincoln Parks upbeat techno remix which simply sounds out of place. Finally, this leaves the screenplay written by director Gareth Edwards... First the good, I appreciate how Edwards directly takes us into the action with no delay, leaving previous engagements with Rama up to interpretation; starting the film this quickly also helps enomorusly with the pacing. However, when the actual plot starts to form the clich\u00e9s starting popping up from left and right, \"I have to get back to my wife because she is having a baby\", \"Brother I have to get you out of this lifestyle\", etc. really eye rolling stuff; overall a lackluster script with excellent pacing. The Raid: Redemption is an excellent showcase of brilliant stunt work and choreography, yet a miserable attempt at story telling; overall a good film. Hopefully the sequel, The Raid 2 Berandal, is far superior to The Raid: Redemption.",

Sometimes I watch a certain kind of film, whether it's drama, romance or in this case, action/martial arts, and I'm completely spellbound. \n\nFor what this film lacks in story, it makes up in unbelievable eye-popping choreography. The fight scenes simply have to be seen to be believed. Moments of shouting at the screen happened frequently as I cheered on the elite police to take down the gangsters controlling the block. This was a sure sign I was way too involved with this film.\n\nBreaking down all the elements for a perfect action film, The Raid has everything. The Hero, the Villain, fights, guns, even a twist, which I never saw coming. Elements aside, what really makes The Raid so successful is its pacing. It knows when to calm after a fight scene and when to pick you back up and fight back again. \n\nWhat did I think? it's a visual, fast paced piece of cinema that refuses to be ignored. I loved it. Best action film of the last decade? Without a doubt. You'll be hearing about The Raid for a long time to come.",

We can see everything that is going on, and all the fights are performed and edited to stunning effect; it's like watching ballet.  Indeed, what 'The Raid' might lack in terms of storytelling, it fairly makes up for with beautifully staged, visceral action sequence that really deliver.  Whilst using mainly the art of silat for the fight scenes, with various members of this extremely fit cast mastering their own styles, no one sequence feels too repetitive, a seemingly conscious effort on the part of Evans.  The film is not subtle, but it packs a hell of a punch and puts on display physical performances which are tiring just to watch!

A SWAT team in Jakarta raids an apartment that is run by a drug lord.  We follow Rama, an officer whose brother happens to be one of the drug lord's henchmen. Unfortunately for the SWAT team, the drug lord knows they're coming and is ready for battle.  \nWriter, director, editor, and choreographer Garreth Evans could be the next best action film director.  He has surrounded himself with actors/stuntmen who know what they're doing.  He frames the action in many long takes so you can follow it and be blown away by the incredible martial arts on display.  \nMost films like this do not need a story to work if the action is good, but The Raid develops its characters enough so we care about their survival.  There are unexpected plot twists that keep the story from being too predictable. And last but not least, Mike Shinoda's music score could not have been better utilized. The Raid is a great action picture.",

            "content": "\"The Raid: Redemption\" is a thoroughly satisfying martial arts film with spectacular stunts and jaw-dropping action. The movie begins with a really ingenious premise: a group of police officers go into an isolated apartment complex to take down a top-of-the-food-chain criminal, only to find that when they get in, they're going to have a really hard time getting out. The officers start off with their weapons but as their numbers and ammunition dwindles, it becomes a struggle for survival and a quest to get some justice too.\n\nThis premise really works because it makes for logical escalations in the action; as the officers run out of ammunitions and resources, they're forced to rely on their wits and hand-to-hand combat skills. This escalation means that no two fights are the same and the movie becomes a real thrill ride to watch. It's constantly topping itself with new opponents, new stunts and will consistently have you groaning as you imagine the pain that the characters in the movie are feeling (not to mention the stunt men). It also helps that the characters in the movie are very intelligent, constantly outwitting each other and playing with your expectations. There's also some good twists and revelations throughout the movie, ensuring that what you see at first isn't what you get in the end and that there's a lot more to the movie than just people beating each other with their hands and feet. While the story is simple, the characters are well drawn and you get attached to them quickly or in the villains' case, they genuinely scare you. When the main villain of the film Tama Riyadi (Ray Sahetapy) is introduced, there's a quick shot where you see him choose the method of execution for a poor soul. In that split second where he hesitates between two weapons (one of which is much more horrible than the other) there's a lot of tension and it actually tears you up a bit. You want to see him taken down, but you also pray that the officers performing the raid are never going to get in contact with the man because he is truly despicable. Even if you are the kind of person that can't stand to read subtitles, the plot is pretty self explanatory and you'll be so impressed with the physical performances and the violence in the film that you will be able to set aside your prejudices. If you're a fan of martial arts or action films this is going to be a real treat and you'll be thrilled throughout. Iko Uwais as Rama, our main character is a real find here, performing some truly spectacular stunts and actually creating a character that you genuinely like. Once the movie is over, you'll want to watch it again and share it with your friends so you can see the looks on their faces while they see the bone-crushing action take place. It's terrific fun. (Original Indonesian with English subtitles, on Blu-ray, April 26, 2013)",

            "content": "Being a critically acclaimed action film with a powerful sequel, The Raid: Redemption was a film I needed to see as a reminder that action films were not dying everywhere.\n\nEssentially the first thing that audiences bear witness to in The Raid: Redemption are the incredible fighting skills of Iko Uwais. Waching him throw a mercilessly quick series of punches against a punching bag immediately reveals the extent of his fighting skills. From there, the film has nothing to do but improve and that is exactly what it does.\nUnilke every Hollywood action film today, The Raid: Redemption serves as a throwback to a time when action was revolutionary by reinventing the genre. It is not a perfect film, but that's because Gareth Evans' sole ambitions are to create a simple powerful action film and a showcase for the Indonesian martial art Pencak Silat. To do that, it creates a plot which is essentially an amalgamation of the story in Die Hard and the real life story of Marcus Luttrell as chronicled in Lone Survivor, with elements of The Warriors. I'm fairly certain these similarities would be coincidental because the simple plot in The Raid: Redemption ignores the over the top narrative devices of western cinema and relies simply on solid action and intense atmosphere to move the narrative along. I use the word solid very loosely because the quality of the action in The Raid: Redemption is something the West has not witnessed ever before. Since the mainstream acition in western society is build predominantly on PG-13 action dominated by excessively choppy editing, shaky camera work or an excess of reliance on visual effects. Instead, The Raid: Redemption relies solely on the amazing action choreography skills of Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhian as well as the powerful work of the cast they trained which is all captured with cinematography which relies on extensive shots of stable cinematography and minimal editing which does not censor the realistically brutal nature of pencak silat combat with all its blood and gore. It is not over the top, but the powerful quantity of blood is striking enough in its realism to force viewers to confront the real brutality of the story, effectively rendering The Raid: Redemption an experience with the power to shock audiences in the most entertaining way. As an excercise in the martial art of pencak silat, The Raid: Redemption is an inspiring film and a much needed change of pace for martial arts films which have laid dormant for far too long. \nTo put it simply, The Raid: Redemption is essentially this generation's Die Hard and Enter the Dragon rolled into one. In that sense it may not have the most original story and may be rather simplistic, but it more than makes up for it as a showcase for pencak silat which leaves viewers forever in a debt of gratitude to the existence of Gareth Evans as a film director. He is one of the few filmmakers living and working with the courage to show the true violent nature of a good fight scene with proper technical characteristics and not bury it beneath an excess of quick editing which continuously proves a challenge to get away with in modern society. But even though the technical aspects of The Raid: Redemption are a key factor in the action being succesful, it is the cast that pulls it off.\nIko Uwais is an absolute revelation in The Raid: Redemption. The Raid: Redemption is a clear sign that Iko Uwais is a born action hero and the next great martial arts star as his skills are beyond the achievements that any western star can reach on screen. Iko Uwais has the swift movements of a John Woo character and the creative versatility of Jet Li on a level which practically beyond belief. My jaw dropped at the sight of the skiolls Iko Uwais displayed in The Raid: Redemption. And yet, he is so much more than just an action hero. In The Raid: Redemption, Iko Uwais also captures the truly intense nature of a police officer under fire throughout every second of the story. He is always on edge as if death is a single step away, and you can see it in his eyes as he pummels his way down the hallways filled with gangs Iko Uwais is with the character every step of the way in The Raid: Redemption through the scenes which require him to act and the ones which demand his fighting skills, and he works to make it a perfect action vehicle for his talents.\nYayan Ruhian is also thoroughly impressive. With the natural look of a street rat, Yayan Ruhian immediately serves as a convincing villain for the story. And yet, he goes beyond his appearance with pencak silat skills which put a new meaning on the phrase \"don't judge a book by its cover\".Yayan Ruhian makes an amazing villain and a powerful challenge for Iko Uwais to face, primarily because his speed is unbelievable and his technique is almost poetic in how well it flows from his body. Yayan Ruhian essentially combines the flowing movements of a ballet performer with the relentless grit of a sadistic criminal which means he is both marvelous to look at and intimidating as hell. Yayan Ruhian is as much of a villain as Iko Uwais is a hero, and the fight scenes that he shares with the cast are an unbelievable amalgamation of talent which shows that he is as important in bringing attention to pencak silat as Iko Uwais is.\n\nSo The Raid: Redemption has a rather familiar and simplistic story, but with fight scenes so unbelievably well choreographed and filmed with precision, The Raid: Redemption is a brutal and exhilarating action film which is likely to leave viewers faithful that the action genre survives and wanting to learn the amazing martial art of pencak silat.",

Gareth Evans direction delivers the action, with some brilliantly choreographed fight scenes & even quieter but tense moments (the scene involving a machete & crawl space in a wall is a highlight).  Unfortunately, his writing is lacking and while he wisely avoids a too complicated plot, a little more character development would have helped, especially for the big twist in the middle of the film.  Plus, as great as the action is, it does get repetitive towards the end, and a conclusion that is rather anti-climatic.  Overall, still one of the best action/martial arts film made in recent years, though not quite a great one.",

The Raid is a masterpiece, no doubt about it. It's pure adrenaline. It's strong, brutal, violent, intense, entertaining. No Hollywood action movie can compare to this. There are massive shooting, fights with bare hands, with knives, with machetes, broken bones, falling bodies. The choreography of the fighting is just perfect. The amount of work that the director, Gareth Evans, puts into the making of this film is simply amazing: every scene was designed perfectly. He doesn't want to just filming some combat but he gives a sense to everything that happens, and the few connecting scenes are treated as good as the action scenes. The plot is indeed at minimum but coherent. The Indonesian stunts are incredible. It stars two of the most talented athletes and  martial arts fighter out there: Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhian. The soundtrack matchs perfectly with the action. This is new classical action movies. It's a watershed, there is a \"before The Raid\" and an \"after The Raid\". Since the release of the film, Hollywood has tried to adapt and has produced movie inspired by the cinematography and the style of The Raid with some good and some bad results, but there is nothing like this. Simply a masterpiece. 10/10.",

It's a frenetic, gritty, brutal, stylish action flick that grabs you from the first minute and doesn't let up till the final frame. Although the plot is about a SWAT team storming a slum apartment block to arrest a gangland boss, it's peppered with Indonesian silat martial art scenes that are breathtaking for their speed, style and creativity -- as well as their brutality. They're some of the most bruising and high-octane punch-ups ever filmed, performed with amazing flair by a host of Indonesian martial artists, including Iko Uwais, the telegenic lead and Yayan Ruhian, the oh-so-evil \"Mad Dog\", who at times exudes an almost demonic, monster-like quality. The camera is kept so close to the action that you feel you're in the thick of the action at all times and the film never lets you off the hook. It's very violent but I don't think it glamorizes violence in the same way as many films of this genre do. The heroes suffer. They would rather not be there. They don't make jokes after killing people -- killing is not fun but a necessary evil.The gangland boss, played Ray Sahetapy, is also worthy of a special mention. He's not your stereotypical baddy, but an aloof, menacing, strangely quiet villain who's devoid of empathy and capable of the most awful atrocity at any moment. Truly scary, and truly new in an Indonesian movie.This is a truly world-class movie and by far the best Indonesian action film I have ever seen. It truly deserves its high score on Metacritic, and is a must-see for all action buffs.",

This movie is also a perfect example of 'show don't tell'. We're not told much about these characters, but you know exactly who they are just by their actions and the way they react to things. The editing and fighting are amazing, as is the soundtrack. 'The Raid' is100% amazing action from start to finish. The best action movie since 'The Matrix'. GO SEE IT!!!",

Never before has human brutality looked so beautiful, presented in a way which would resemble an intricate dance if it weren't for the copious blood and bone-snapping. It's a joy to see a relatively unknown martial art being practiced on the big screen, and the Indonesian Pencak Silat allows for the choreographing of action unlike any you've ever seen before. The plot, which involves a SWAT team fighting their way through an apartment block controlled by a malicious drug lord flies along, and the film is tense, gritty and pulse-pounding throughout. Iko Uwais plays Rama, the film's primary protagonist, who is a young new addition to the SWAT team, and his almost supernatural skill with Silat is in unquestionable as Rama is forced to undertake the majority of the film's fights against hordes of drug cartel henchmen single-handedly. Uwais is far more than a blunt instrument however, and in the long tradition of strong silent types with a good heart throughout film history, it is established early on in the film that Rama is only committing the acts of brutality he does to provide a safe and financially secure life for his wife and soon-to-be-born child. The drug lord Tama (Ray Sahetapy) is also shown to be the most diabolical of evil-doers, a representation of everything wrong with contemporary Indonesia, and thoroughly deserving of everything that comes to him. Uwais, along with Yayan Ruhian, who plays the terrifying and volatile bodyguard Mad Dog choreographed the film and made the numerous action sequences so explosive and memorable. Though the film in a sense de-sensitises you to violence, such is the extent and frequency of it on screen, you are brought crashing back down to reality by Writer/Director Gareth Evans' human characters and subtextual comments on social problems prevalent in modern Indonesia (poverty, the break-down of family units and the dominance of the illegal drugs trade are all referenced within the film's narrative). Evans is not just incredibly talented as an action director, guiding cinematographer Matt Flannery's stylish camera work, and undertaking the striking, expert film editing himself, but he's also an effective and intelligent, though minimalistic screenwriter, and as a passionate promoter of Indonesian culture, which he clearly has a great love of. He's certainly a real talent to watch, and I am incredibly excited to see how else he can elevate the action genre, and perhaps other areas of cinema in the future.",

The movie focuses on an Indonesian special ops team's raid -- and presumed redemption -- of a crime lord's building. Countless criminals live in the rooms and roam the halls. Some pack knives, others carry guns, and one enjoys using his fists and feet. Who says you can't stay fit? Needless to say they're none too happy when spec ops invades, prompting one of the various shoot outs. These sequences are very well done from a technological standpoint, boasting simply stunning stunt work. However, not a single character comes to life as a human being. In this movie people exist primarily to be beaten, shot, and/or stabbed. In fact, many rush forward to do so. One fight scene features around twenty criminals rushing the protagonist, who easily disables or kills each and every one of them. This -- other than his pregnant wife -- is how you can tell he is the protagonist. At no point do any of the criminals look around and say, \"Hey, guys, this isn't working like we planned. Do you think maybe we should try something else?\" What little plot there is seems to have been lifted from bits and scenes of better action flicks with less impressive action sequences. Still the stunts and technology deserve praise.

The story is that of Rama, a rookie police officer who with another 20 or so police officers is taking part in a Raid (to my complete shock) of an apartment building being run by a notorious drug lord.

The film, to almost every male viewers joy, is almost wall to wall violence. It's manic, its fast paced, its incredibly inventive and it takes up almost all of the film. The few moments were there is actual talking it is to progress to the next fight, the next set piece meaning there is little place for emotion of character in the film. It might make me sound greedy but a little more story and dialogue was needed as by the end of the movie I was visually impressed but emotionally anaesthetised. There is no doubt the director is talented and put a considerable amount of passion into the way he presented the movie as the direction is unexpected and at times shocking (but in a good way). He made the film he wanted to make and with very little to spend on it and that is commendable, especially considering the levels of destruction the film brings, but all in all its an action film with no soul, no one to root for as its just two groups of people massacring each other in an old building.",

In a time of CG, 3D and artificial action sequences, The Raid stands tall as one of the greatest action movies in years, the only things that have the intensity and pure raw violence are Ong Bak and Chocolate from Thailand. The story certainly could've been more polished, but it's undeniably relentlessly gripping from the first thrown punch.The Raid is about a police squad that storm into an apartment, which doubles as a nest of criminals / martial artists, in order to apprehend a drug lord. They'll soon find that these thugs are very well trained despite their cryptic outfits. The hoodlums come down pouring in dozens, launching punches, kicks and bullets their way, generally making their lives harder. In a short moment, the raid turns into a struggle for survival. Iko Uwais plays Rama, one of a rookie cop who's trapped in the building, deliver the best visceral combat scenes I've ever seen in Indonesian cinema.Highly fast paced and devastating, it's not your usual near-miss exaggerated camera angle shots a la your average action movies, neither it's flying stylish acrobatic wire fu of Hong Kong, The Raid is a beast on its own right. The director, Gareth Evans, cleverly uses pencak silat, an Indonesia traditional martial art, mixes it with many aspects of MMA and also plenty usage of sharp weapons or even handguns. Every movement is designed to hurt, immensely and veraciously, you won't find flashy dashing choreography here.Expect plenty faces hammered into the wall, knives introduced to throats and even point blank headshot. All in its uncensored bloodstained glory. The amount and quality of the fights are ridiculously excessive, world class even. This will shock many international audiences, as it already has. Scenes are masterfully done, giving clean shots to dramatic moments, even those without someone getting pummeled. The director has a sense of focus which gives clarity in midst of high octane scenes.However it's not without its flaws. Some plot holes remain unchecked as the characters' motivations are a bit vague, maybe for the sequel, I'm not sure. The dialogues can be gritty as I viewed it on my native language, but it can also be a double edge sword. At some points, it becomes unintentionally funny because the delivery of Malay accent is over-the-top. I do hope it won\u00e2",

The movie had a gritty realism to it and of course the only thing that subtracted from this was the awesome but unbelievable fight scenes. The fight scenes in the movie were explosive, clever, often gory and always satisfying if you appreciate this style in any way. Some of the scenes definitely reminded me of 'Oldboy'. I give the movie a 7/10 as I am not all about action in movies and wanted a little more in other departments, but for what it is I do not really fault this film.

It shows some moments of promise like the propane tank in the fridge but it's not worth siting through the stupid moments like the part where the entire team lost their firearms for seemingly no reason other than to showcase some of the mediocre kung fu fights, or the part where a character was about to explain why they can't call for backup but stops as if he just realized their really is no reason why they can't. Oh and there's the part where an unarmed character walks past a gun and two tonfas, without picking them up for absolutely no reason, and don't even get me started on the part where a villain who has a guy at gun point drops the gun and gives the cliche \"I don't like using guns.

It's screenplay is so deprived of character, plot, emotion, and logic that it becomes pointless.  The basic premise of a raid on a labyrinth building full of gangsters could have been made into a crazy, scary, and tension filled ride, but the apartment complex looks almost exactly the same on every floor, and the main character has about as much vulnerability as the hulk.  It works fine as a showcase for some incredibly kinetic martial arts showdowns... for a while.  It just becomes so repetitive and sadistically gory that by the end you feel like it was more of a pro wrestling special (if you think they're real you need help)  than an actual movie.  Every cop is somehow a master at hand to hand combat, and no one wants to pick up any of the machine guns lying around because,  squeezing a trigger, that's like ordering take-out.\"  It throws logic out the window purposefully, because otherwise there couldn't be non-stop fighting.

It's certainly of interest if you're interested in relentless bone-jarring violence. Plot is paper thin; an elite swat invade a building to takte out a crime boss. The elite squad all get massacred almost immediately, apart from the protagonist and a few comrades. There's a huge gunfight at the beginning, but they obviously used up all the bullets in Indonesia as beyond that they resort to bladed weapons and bare fists. The protagonist beats up hundreds of low level henchmen on his own. Of course this being a martial arts film they all patiently wait in line to attack him one at a time. There are some boss battles on the way before we arrive at the bloody finale. The plot is very reminiscent of a video game and the violence is relentless and gratuitous. It's ok if you're into choreographed fight sequences, but I prefer something like Die Hard which has characters, a story and a little humour, in addition to all the violence. This movie is just wall to wall fighting.",

The SWAT team goes floor by floor securing the building and neutralizing threats, when suddenly on the 6th floor, they get spotted and all hell breaks loose. Simple ain't it ? well that's the beauty of The Raid, at least the first one, it takes what is a very simple premise and engages the viewer with the team, feeling their despair and fright, making them easy to root for and constantly afraid of their safety as the film proves very soon that they're very, VERY expendable. Same goes for our leading man played by the Martial Arts maestro of Indonesia, Iko Uwais, whose introduction of himself, and his family, gives us just enough to know that it's him we will be following through the story but not enough to make us COMPLETELY assured that he will survive, Uwais just sort of carries this John McClane type of charisma with him, you root for the guy without having knowing much about his background(and in all honesty it's better off that way) yet as you imagine yourself in this situation you feel like Rama in a lot of ways, same goes for the rest of the team, from the fierce and loyal Jaka(Joe taslim), to the mysterious and harsh Lieutenant Wahyu, the vaillains are great too, the left and right hand men of the brutal, yet cunning Tama are a perfect balance between a silent fighter and a careful schemer. Each and every character has more personality and depth than you'd expect out of a film with this particular premise and this particular genre.The action sequences are legendary to this day and will probably serve as bright and energizing examples of how to do, intricate, intense martial arts/action choreography and film it in the most coherent and exhilarating ways possible for many generations to come. Writer/director/editor Gareth Evans has a keen eye for long-takes and brisk editing, combine that with the relentless pace of the film, and you get a non-stop action thrill ride that quite literally BEATS THE **** out of most modern Hollywood blockbusters of this caliber. These are people who have passion and skill to make the action as hard-hitting and natural as possible, and the choreography by the cast members including Uwais and Yayan Ruhian, who plays the vicious and nearly unkillable Mad Dog in the film, is nothing short of consistently inventive and remarkable. The fights are greatly varied too, from the first and only shootout, to machete fights with necks being slammed on the broken door lintels, to single take jumps from A **** WINDOW, and of course the classic Hong Kong action movie style one on one and even two on one showdowns. The most underrated and overlooked aspect of the film, is actually the fact that in some ways it's a horror film as well, a horror-survival martial arts action films is what Wikipedia says and is very true. There's constant tension and fear of detection and discovery as the gang not only outnumbers but outmatches the rapidly dying team. The score by Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda, Joe Trapenese and Fajar Yuskemal is superb, perfectly combining, electronic beats with the more rock'n'roll side of the aforementioned band, to create a compelling and visceral score for the fight scenes. All these elements come together to deliver a blistering experience, full of blood, slashed necks and more than enough broken bones.The Raid is a kinetic, exciting and uncompromising Martial arts action film, that makes you care for performers and love their performance, both emotional and physical. The only reason I'm not giving this a 10, is because I think that the sequel is EVEN BETTER and that if a question was ever put of me deciding to eliminate one Raid film forever, it would definitely be the first.",

A SWAT team with 20 members is on a raid to capture the legendaryAn intense and well choreographed action movie that is strong from start to finish. Also pretty brutal and a no nonsense approach. The set up is excellent and wasted no time. A SWAT team with 20 members is on a raid to capture the legendary crime lord Tama who is feared, worshiped and ruthless. He lives in an apartment block guarded with his loyal men and rented rooms for others under his protection. The plan is not to go in guns blazing as it is to risky and will surly backfire. They will silently go in to capture room for room from floor to floor. The further they get without being detected the better their chances get. For the new officer Rama it is his first mayor assignment. Here I stop to avoid spoilers. For the story I am impressed as they do more than needed for an action movie and everything works well. All twists are fully believable, enhance the story  and in combination with the fitting characters we get a really enjoyable experience. I have to praise the whole cast. Lets start wit the main actor Iko Uwais as Rama. He is a great protagonist and his struggles make him even more believable aka better. He easily won me over and I want to see more from him. Ray Sahetapy as Tama is frightening good. His introduction scene alone I would use in film school on how to set up a bad guy. It dropped our jars and made him as menacing as scary. Yayan Ruhian as Mad Dog is also one of my favorites. He is always shorter and smaller than his enemies and this could be a miss in other movies. But by god he is a menacing fighter you have to take 100% serious. You never want to get on his bad side. An amazing performance and I want to see more. The rest also deliver. Donny Alamsyah as Andi is more than it seems and works great. Joe Taslim as Jake the leader of the SWAT nails his role and each scene with him is a stregth. Special praise to I think Alfredius Godfred as the machete wielding criminal. His eyes and gaze alone deliver more than others do with words. He is so scary. I see no flaws in the cast and say this is a masterpiece in this regard. I must mention the well choreographed martial arts and action scenes. I only discovered this movie through praise from a YouTube channel which ranked it in the top well choreographed modern martial arts movies. It is fully deserved as the fights are intense, awesome to watch and the poster child for the phrase \u201cYou can feel the impact\u201d. A must see for me. Of cause I must also mention that it is brutal and often we gasped during the movie. The sets of the building fully give the derelict feeling and round up the experience. All in all this was a pleasant surprise and I give a 10/10 because it hits all the right spots for action, characters, martial arts and gives a satisfying ending.",

If I estimated the'The Raid: Redemption'' is an indonesian made martial arts/action thriller that is all about violence. All violence. Wall-to-wall violence. Against many of those walls, heads are pounded again and again into a pulpy mass. If I estimated the film has 15 minutes of dialogue, i think i would be generous.\rBut then again, what does my opinion matter, it is highly rated on every movie critic site on the planet and it is hailed as a breakthrough for martial arts.\rI dont mind violence at all, nor do i mind a movie that tells its story visually, but the director (Gareth Evans) doesnt take the effort to make it a well-made film, it's basically 100 minutes of non stop action, with no plot, no characters, barely any dialogue, and just constant hard-driving, butt-kicking, pulse-pounding, bone-crunching, skull-smashing, bloodcurdling and largely a hand-to-hand, fist-to-face, foot-to-groin battle, with a few machetes and guns tossed in for good measure. Which is a formula Evans clearly knows is a large audience for, hence the obviously high ratings, and movies like this just dont entertain me at all. It's basically you watching a well-made realistic martial arts mission-type video game.\r Detailed criticism: Why does the movie establishes that the ''lead role'' is a muslim in the beginning of the film? They do nothing at all with it after the opening scene. It seems pointless, except as a cheap, failed attempt in some sort of character development. But it is pointless to even attempt at something like that, no one in the film has a personality, they are all relentless fighters with no brain in their heads.\rAnother cheap plot point that was extremely predictable: one of the gangsters that is helping the drug lord that is camping out in this massive squat, is Rama's brother (The ''leading man''). Thus it is ofcourse inevitable that they eventually will hold each other's lives in their hands and resolve deep childhood feelings to their satisfaction at the end of the film, and that they obviously both survive and go their ways in the end...\rLike i said, ''The Raid: Redemption'' is basically a well-made video game: a ruthless fighter stands in a corridor and destroys an enemy. As the enemy falls, another jumps into position from around corner, ready to be destroyed in turn. Then another, and another. It's like they're being ejected by an automatic victim dispenser.\rAnother small detail: What the hell does \"Redemption\" mean in the title? Who, or what, is redeemed, and how? If you kill lots of people and are still alive, have you been redeemed? If you and your brother don't kill each other after almost everyone else does, is that redemption? Or is \"redemption\" just one of those title words like \"reloaded\" or \"destiny\" to help people tell movies apart? Seems a bit stupid in my humble opinion, but i think i read somewhere that Gareth Evans is making the third installment of the Raid trilogy (yay) and he said that the 3rd film will take place before the first ''Raid'', so probably something will happen in that film that needs redeeming..\r Another thing, this movie is inconsistent and unrealistic as hell, not just because something ridiculous like this would NEVER happen, but also because most people they ''kill'' go down by just getting kicked in the stomach, or getting slammed into a wall, or getting dropped on a table, and then there is a final fight with ''Mad Dog'' where he continues to fight for at least 5 minutes whilst having a fluorecent tube stuck in his neck, and before that he's been kicked and punched to absolute pulp. But he just continues to fight.\rIt's inconsistent as hell\r The only reason i gave it a 2/5 instead of giving it lower, is simply because, i can't deny that the stunts and fight choreography isnt fantastic, and the way they killed (some) people was quite creative.\r All in all, movies like this simply dont entertain me, no depth, no story, no characters and just constant neck-breaking action, but that's what it's meant to be. Something like this just doesnt quite suit me.\rCan't dare expect the redemption from the sequel for what I found lacking here. Yet I guess I'll give it a go. (yay)\r\"The Raid: Redemption\" will be most successful for people with A.D.D. or just generally short attention spans, but then again, that's what it's aimed at.",
