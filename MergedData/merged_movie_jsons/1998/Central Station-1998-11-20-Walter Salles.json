            "content": "This film, which we watched at the Vancouver Film Festival years ago, turned up the other night on cable. On second viewing, the film still packs quite an impact, as it still feels real. The work of Walter Salles and Fernanda Montenegro was amazing then, and still is now.This is the story about a cynic and jaded woman who resorts to do menial work and who is a small con artist herself. Dora has seen better days. She is retired now, but in order to make ends meet, she sets a letter writing desk at Rio's train station where she writes letters dictated to her by the illiterate and eager people who can't do the job as they want to communicate with distant family and friends through Dona Dora. In many cases, as it's the case with the letter she has written for Ana, she has no intention of ever sending those missives dictated to her by the unsuspecting people.Josue, the small boy, who witness the death of his mother, is wiser for his younger years than one might suspect. He sees right through Dora as a charlatan and a con woman. When Dora takes the boy home, she has no intentions of ever helping him much more than a few days. Later, upon learning about the adoption agency, she sells the boy to the unscrupulous people involved in the traffic of children for a thousand dollars without any problems. It's only when her friend Irene tells her the fate that Josue will encounter, that Dora leaps into action.Since she can't stay home without having to return her money, she takes Josue on the road. This odd couple begins the journey as complete strangers, but this voyage will make them appreciate one another and even move Dora into becoming a better woman for having the courage to do the right thing. Josue also realizes that Dora, in her own way, has been, for however short, the mother he lost in the tragic accident.Fernanda Montenegro, perhaps Brazil's best actress, is amazing as Dona Dora. She is the whole reason for seeing the movie. Her Dora is one of the best creations in her film career. This intense performer shows an actress who fully understand who Dora is and the way she would behave in the situation. Young Vinicius Oliveira is a sweet Josue, and Marilia Pera, is the kind Irene, who makes Dora see the monstrosity of what she was about to do.The music by Jacques Morelembaum and Antonio Pinto is an asset, as it adds an atmosphere to the long journey of Dora and Josue. The interesting cinematography by Walter Carvalho, shows the immensity of Brazil's interior as the odd couple go to find the little boy's father.This film is a triumph for both Walter Salles and Fernanda Montenegro.",

            "content": "It took me 10 years to learn of this film's existence. I'm very sorry I wasn't paying more attention. It came out at a time when I had pretty much given up on films in general and Hollywood films in particular.How was I to know that somewhere in the world a courageous director chose to film a story that didn't involve sex, comic-book sadistic or crime-glorifying violence, fake superheroics or CGI-augmented horror? How was I to know that not all Latin directors were involved in a world of idiotic and heartless self-centered proto-fascistic make-believe like, say, Guillermo Del Toro? How was I to know that Brazilian actress Fernanda Montenegro who got robbed of an Oscar by Gwyneth Paltrow in the almost preternaturally ridiculous and superficial \"Shakespeare In Love\" gave a performance that is rarely imaginable at the movies? Or that Brazil could produce a film that can rival Murnau's \"Sunrise\" or the neo-realist masterpieces of Vittorio De Sica for the title of \"best film ever made\"?I watched this multi-leveled, multi-faceted reflexion piece dubbed in French late one recent Sunday night on Radio-Canada while recovering from the flu. The tears I cried were very good for my sinus condition. But they were also cried for the fact that I was such an idiot for having let this film slip by.If you haven't seen it yet, there is still time. Watch it and ask yourself: What happened to America that it can't tell simple, moving and true stories like this one anymore? You won't have to cry but you will anyway.",

He does this with the help of Dora (Fernanda Montenegro). She writes letters for illiterate people in the central station of Rio de Janeiro. Dora has a secret, she doesn't mail the letters. She knows Josu\u00e9 because he and his mother used to write letters to Josu\u00e9's father and when his mother dies she takes care of him, although she has other intentions at first.The movie is mainly about the relationship between the boy and the woman. Of course they meet people on the road. Especially the part where they travel with a truck driver is very good. We also see a little of the life in Brazil. This is a movie with a good story that is very well directed. The acting is terrific. Montenegra as the older woman and especially De Oliveira as the boy is very good.",

            "content": "Central do Brasil has everything.  You come expecting a story of a woman who takes care of a child in a harsh social milieu.  You sit in disbelief as this woman shows herself to be a heartless opportunist, and as your expectations are being confounded, you begin to realize how this villainess came to be such a person.  The boy she begins to help is also no innocent movie cherub, he has an endearing slyness and a will to survive despite the horrible tragedy he has experienced.  Their road trip is an odyssey from bad to worse, and you begin to sympathize.  The characters they meet and the landscape they traverse give us in the north a flavor of Brazil which I cannot confirm as being authentic.  But they seem as complex and beautiful and full of contradiction as the Brazilian music that I love.  And the final destination for the boy (you're on the edge of your seat hoping things will turn out right) is not a happily-ever-after, but seems to indicate a new direction for the character.If I sound overly sentimental (I'm sure I do) it's because very few films have moved me like this one.  I watched it through three times and cried at the scene of Dora on the bus every time.  The use of religious imagery, from the modern evangelicalism of the truck driver to the more unfamiliar scenes with the pictures of the saints (incredible camerawork here) added dimensions of complexity in a medium where Christianity is often treated either in a saccharine fashion or with heavyhanded disdain.

What makes one movie telling the same storyline more worthwhile to see is a combination of creative expression, in depth character development, superb acting, exquisite photography, and believability, or the ability to persuade the moviegoer to suspend disbelief.How many times have we been exposed to a retelling of Shirley Temple's Heidi, where a young non-related child falls into the life of an old curmudgeon, and teaches that curmudgeon to enjoy life and/or develop morals and values? Too many times for me, so I was reluctant to see this film. It would have been a shame had I not.There are many creative twists and turns along the way to keep the suspense level up in this film. The photography in Rio is OK, but once out in the Brazilian countryside, it is fantastic. At the end of the film, there is little doubt but that the way this story turns out is how it would have had to turn out. The character development of Josue is a little weak, but that of Dora is superb. And you will see a lot of films before you will see an acting performance like Fernanda Montenegro's as Dora again.This movie thankfully is not overly sentimental, that would get in the way of the story, it is just a great film to watch and enjoy. 9 of 10.",

Then I saw it again and remained intrigued by the writing, acting, and directing. Even the cinematography, which is not your usual fare, added much to the fullness of the story.The first half hour or so of this movie is somewhat disturbing to watch since people and their needs seem to be so expendable, but from that very stark reality -- which is so real it has been reported repeatedly by the media -- love has a chance to make at least this one story different.One of the most amazing things about this movie is how Vinicius de Oliveira was able to perform so well that he excellently complemented the acting of one of Brazil's top actresses. From shoe shine boy to a riveting performance in a major film. Good for him. I hope he makes his mark. And no less praise for Montenegro who was splendid in her interpretation of Dora, or for Marilia Pera for her very candid performance as Dora's neighbor.***SPOILER ALERT*** I think a miracle occurred when Dora fainted, and that she was never to be the same person after that.",

            "review_title": "Masterful Montenegro Dominates Salles' Career-Defining Road Movie",
            "content": "Like Gena Rowlands in this country (who ironically did a similar film, 1996's \"Unhook the Stars\"), Brazil's Fernanda Montenegro is a masterful actress who inhabits her characters wholly with a minimum of fuss and a maximum of personal depth. In this beautifully filmed 1998 film directed by Walter Salles, she offers a superbly realistic portrayal of an aging, embittered spinster named Dora, who earns money by writing letters for illiterate passers-by at Rio de Janeiro's Central Station. At the outset, she is a petty thief who takes the letters and decides with her friend Irene which ones to post if at all. Her dull world changes when Josu\u00e9, the nine year-old son of a woman for whom Dora has written a letter, suddenly becomes orphaned when the woman is killed by a speeding bus. The letter was to be sent to Josu\u00e9's father to reunite the family. Now his plight gradually becomes Dora's concern, and over the course of the film, her destiny.What Salles does with great dexterity is show the gradual closeness between Dora and Josu\u00e9 without resorting to any obvious sentimental plot devices, as neither is particularly sympathetic at the beginning and use their surly, obstinate personalities as protective shells. Even though this story has an overly familiar structure, Salles and screenwriters Jo\u00e3o Emanuel Carneiro and Marcos Bernstein bring a heavy dose of neo-realism within the unfamiliar, non-tourist locales used. It's all reminiscent of Vittorio de Sica's and Roberto Rosellini's classic post-WWII work in Italy like \"The Bicycle Thief\" and \"Open City\". With his later film, 2004's wonderful \"The Motorcycle Diaries\" and now slated to film Jack Keroauc's seminal \"On the Road\", Salles is obviously becoming known as a master of the road movie, and it is easy to see why with this work. Helping considerably is the stunning cinematography of Walter Carvalho, who presents vividly inhabited tableaux with each new phase of the journey from the bustle of inner-city Rio to the open roads to the religious pilgrimage to the new shoebox-style settlement.But it is Montenegro who dominates the proceedings as she gradually develops a character who earns our sympathy economically and honestly as she makes every moment count. For example, as she senses herself becoming attracted to Cesar, the religious truck driver, she applies a stranger's lipstick with a quivering hesitation that is almost as heartbreaking as the realization she faces moments later that he has left for good. A real shoeshine boy picked by Salles, Vin\u00edcius de Oliveira plays Josu\u00e9 with equal economy and responds to Dora's actions with realism that alternates between touching and frustrating. Smaller roles are filled expertly with Mar\u00edlia P\u00eara amusingly ebullient as Irene and Othon Bastos compellingly conflicted as Cesar. The climax comes a bit out of left field with the introduction of new characters that provide some amount of closure to Josu\u00e9's fate and wrap up many of the open plot threads, but the somewhat pat turn does not undermine the genuine strength of the film.The DVD provides a nice extra with Montenegro, Salles, and producer Arthur Cohn contributing invaluable audio commentary in English. Salles and Cohn talk about the sources of inspiration for the movie as well as the more technical aspects including the rigors of location shooting with masses of amateur actors and a minimum of art direction and constructed sets. Montenegro speaks less, but like her performance, makes all her comments resonate. It's interesting how variations of the film's basic plot have come up in recent years - for instance, Jan Sver\u00e1k's 1996 \"Kolya\" from the Czech Republic and Takeshi Kitano's 2000 \"Kikujiro\" from Japan - and this one certainly holds up well as a prototype.",

It's technically hard to fault, with good performances and particularly good visuals, and a simple story that's told decently.For some reason, though, I never found myself too invested. If that's on me for expecting too much or anticipating something slightly different, I don't know. It was nice, and like I said, well-made of course, just not something I found emotionally involving.It could also be a cultural thing- sometimes references or subtext (maybe even text) can be lost when watching a film from a country you're not familiar with, so really, I have very little authority to judge this movie. All I can mention is how I felt after watching it, because that's what I like doing on this app.And I hope I haven't offended anyone reading this who does love the movie.

However to make it more profitable, she takes the letters home and destroys them.  One of her repeat clients is a mother and son who write to the son's no good father.  When the mother is killed crossing the street, Dora reluctantly takes Josu\u00e9 into her home, but only with plans to sell him.  A small change of heart leads them into a cross-country trip to return Josu\u00e9 to his absent father.I suspect that many users take the view that a film has more merit if it is in a foreign language and is in subtitles.  I'm not saying that all viewers do this but I notice that good foreign films tend to have greater praise than good western films.  Anyway, aside from that, this film is still worthy of praise \u0096 even if the plot treads a familiar and slightly predictable road.  Despite this, it is well told and is quite touching.  The way the characters change is touching and gradual \u0096 at times it verges on the overly slow but for the most part it is a nicely paced tale.A big part of the reason this works as well as it does is the two lead performances.  Montenegro is great as Dora and works even better as she is an unknown quantity to me.  If a well known actress (to me at least) had played her then I might have had baggage that came with her \u0096 e.g. if she was well known for `nice' characters then I might have not accepted her character.  As it was, she was wonderfully unpleasant and unsympathetic for much of the film \u0096 making any changes in her evident and touching.  De Oliveira is excellent, not only for a child but for an actor full stop!  I have never understood why so many western films employ child actors who are sickly cute.  Here De Oliveira is realistic and touching in his performance.The film is not perfect.  It does wander a little bit while on the road, and some of it feels far too slow.  Plus the plot is familiar and goes just where you expect it to.  That said, it is still a classic product and is quite touching at several points.  Not a movie for cinema goers who demand something to blow up every few minutes, but it is touching and has two wonderful performances from Montenegro and De Oliveira.",

Not only is the story raw and touching but it is graced by the magnificence of actress Fernanda Montenegro who continues to be Brazil's finest actress both on stage and on film. The story is a bit disturbing at first: Do\u00f1a Dora is an elderly educated woman, with a history of turning to grifting for life support, sit in the Central Station and makes her money by writing letters dictated to her by the illiterate people who line up for her services - but Do\u00f1a Dora often trashes the letters after collecting her fee. Into her life enters Josue (Vinicius de Oliveira), a young kid who witnessed the death of his other and is searching for his father. Josue is world wise and sees Do\u00f1a Dora for what she is - a con artist. But the old lade takes Josue home on the superficial disguise that she will help him only to later sell him to the illegal adoption racketeers for money. After being paid for her sale, her friend Irene (Marilia Pera) informs her of what likely will be Josue's fate and knowing that she cannot right her wrong without returning the trafficker's fee, she escapes her home, taking Josue on the road to find his father. The 'road trip' results in a mutual respect and love between the two - Do\u00f1a Dora softens, having made a kind change in her life, and Josue gains the feeling of love for the mother he has lost. Walter Salles understands emotion, when to allow the tragedies to emerge and subside and also how to credibly introduce the change of philosophy of his actors. The cinematography by Walter Carvalho captures both the claustrophobia of Rio de Janeiro as well as the desolation of the raw uninhabited lands outside the city where the strange couple go. But the real reason for the success of this film is the multifaceted sensitive portrayal of Do\u00f1a Dora by Fernanda Montenegro - a performance that has and will continue to make film history.

From the surface, this is just a basic road movie of a lonely woman escorting a young boy who's just lost his mother in a car accident, to his dad's house across Brazil. She takes pity on him after he is forced out onto the street, and despite initial distrust between both parties (with good reason... she nearly sells him to organ farmers) they forge a grudging alliance which increases the closer they reach their destination. These are not perfect people... they lie and steal with abandon, and little remorse. But that is what makes them so relatable, and even the smallest role is filled by someone who has noticeable quirks. In other words, don't expect any cardboard cut-out characters here.It's also a great travelogue for Brazil, as we get to see all the beauty and ugliness that makes the country one of the most cosmopolitan around. It makes a nice change for a film to be shot there, without one scene set on a sun-kissed beach. With the twin events of The World Cup and The Olympics on the horizon though, it'll be interesting to see if most of the poverty and crime present here has been eradicated over 16 years. My guess is no. Tourists, hang onto your cameras. Back to the present... this is a wonderful film, full of depth and insight, which will resonate long after its over.

            "content": "Recently, I bumped into a list of Top 10 Brazilian movies, \"City of God\" was there but the absence of Golden Palm winner \"Black Orpheus\" puzzled me. But \"Central do Brazil\" was there and maybe in the top position, my expectations were high and so was my disappointment.While there are many things to appreciate in this movie, I couldn't get past that feeling that the screenplay was -yes, that dirty word- manipulative, why should some emotional movies be deemed with that ugly label while others get away with it? That's the nature of the beast.The film started very well, with a yellowish lighting suggesting the ending of the day, when it's rush hour in the station and the passengers' challenge is to immediately get into the train (the youngest ones gracefully slip through the windows, preventing the older and weaker ones to have a seat), the placed is crowded, noisy, and this is where operates Dora, Fernanda Montenegro as a public writer for illiterate people (a job that exists in many emerging countries). Dora listens and writes: love letters, insults, letters for friends, or for Jesus, people's waste of life is her way of living. How do customers know she'll send the letters? They're simple enough to trust her, she's unscrupled enough to joke about them with her neighbor and friend, a younger celibate played Marilia Pera. When she doesn't tear the letters, she keeps them in a drawer called the Purgatory.We get it, that's her character-establishing moment, Dora is a disillusioned and bitter woman who faces enough ugliness in the world to afford any professional conscience. But there's a fine line between writing an unlikable character and making such an effort to portray her without any redeeming qualities whatsoever than we can process from the very start the mechanisms of the plot. The more unlikable Dora appears, the more apparent the story arc's starter is and the more obvious that her journey will make her a better person. That we expect something good to happen doesn't ruin the enjoyment but creates an uneasy feeling of fakery, which is certainly not the intended effect of a realistic portrayal of Brazilian society.Speaking of realism, how about that: a mother comes a second time with her son Josue (Vinicius de Oliveria) asking to rewrite a friendlier letter to her disappeared husband (Dora didn't even send the first letter), Then the mother is hit by a bus. She dies. Dora wasn't remotely shocked, maybe she didn't realize it was the same woman she saw one minute earlier, but then wasn't she surprised when she saw Josue coming back *alone* the next day? Is \"Scram!\" something you'd say to a boy who just lost his mother? While we're at it, are we to believe that there's no Children Protection organization, that no one cared for the boy, no family? His mother was taken to a hospital and he was left alone stranded in the station for days?Let's move on. Dora has a change of heart and takes him to her home but only to sell him to an Child Association and get enough money to buy a new TV. If it wasn't for her friend warning her against people that kill children to sell organs (another great depiction of Brazil), Dora would have probably been responsible for a cruel death. Thanks God, Dora's immorality has limits. She's lucky enough to come at time and take Josue back. Apparently her plan was to make diversion by proposing other children... but why would she give real photographs and expose other kids is she knows they're dangerous people? We'll never know, but that doesn't matter since the road movie can finally kick off. After another failed attempt to abandon Josue, the two finally stick together and the bond can be consolidated through the usual ice-melting episodes.. It's an old story of the sweet kid taming the cold heart of an adult (Heidi, Gloria to name these) but the interactions work thanks to the performance of Montenegro, nominated for an Oscar.Josue is more problematic though. The kid is cute and knows how to deliver cold stares or enthusiastic stares, but I could feel director Walter Salles mentoring him behind. It's all in the body language, when they learn the father isn't in the right house, he has that sad walk with his head down that reads 'sadness for the dummies'; when he's got an idea, his smile is as obvious as the pre-prank grins in \"Problem Child\"; he knows how to \"look\" angry or scared. This is not bad acting but excellent pretending, but it never feels natural. And when the acting is fine, we get that overplayed, sad melody that comes at the right time to remind us this is not a comedy we're watching.Of course, it's impossible not to ignore the journey into some places in Brazil other than Rio and the Carnival: the isolated towns, the religious ceremonials, the housing development and its cardboard houses but it's much difficult to ignore some glaring loose ends in the plot. Besides those I mentioned before: How could the man in the truck not figure that Dora stole the food from the grocery? And how come Dora left Josue without even asking him? Why would she trust her instinct that failed her so many times?Maybe because she could finally get back to her life but now with the satisfaction of having done the right thing and becoming a good person. Hence her cries and smile at the end. This time, she would send the letters. And I guess Josue's smile at the end is because the 9-year old kid figured all that existential boost and was happy to see the most important person in her life leave him maybe forever. Yes, that makes sense.The film had noble intentions but ended up splashing into the schmaltz it kept avoiding.",

This lady and this boy, so different in personalities and ages, have a troubled relationship at first and during much of the movie. They have a really hard time to get along. But later they do and well. And yet, just when things are getting fine for them, circumstances force them to separate from each other, although they find ways to remember each other.

While traveling through the countryside the audience gets to enjoy shot after shot of breathtaking scenery and is really able to appreciate the beauty of Brazil. There is a subtle religious symbolism that is most noticeable in the biblical names of the characters. Young Josu\u00e9 is searching for and continually waiting for Jesus to come back. He has put his faith in something unseen but has no doubts about its existence. It's his child-like faith that ultimately inspires Dora to believe as well that Jesus will one day return.

            "content": "'Central Do Brasil' can easily be described as an extraordinary road movie, perhaps a prototype film of the genre. Salles tells a very down to earth story with the use of simple devices. The sets look very raw which adds to the realism of the story. But also the high crime that has dominated much of Brasil is shown in a very subtle way (e.g. the scene where the thief is shot dead and the one about giving children up for 'adoption'). Similarly, the characters are very well defined and easy to relate to. None of them are likable at the beginning but the beautiful transformation, as they develop, wins the viewer's heart.There is a poetic quality to it that, next to the eloquent writing, is also reflected through the lyrical dialogues, the simple soundtrack and Walter Carvalho's expert cinematography. The cross-country Brazilian landscape looks familiar but at the same time breathtaking. The city shots are brilliantly executed capturing the crowd, heat, commotion and chaos and they contrast well with the village sequences.The acting is superb all the way. Mar\u00edlia P\u00eara is very likable as Dora's friend. In a way she also serves as her conscience as she provokes Dora to rethink her 'immoral' decisions. Vin\u00edcius de Oliveira is terrific as Dora's younger counterpart. He holds his own matching wits with Fernanda Montenegro. Their scenes together are the most amusing and moving parts of the film. Finally, it is Montenegro who towers above all with a knockout performance. Her transformation from a bitter, self-centred and greedy spinster to a loving and caring motherly figure is portrayed with sincerity and 'minimalism'. It is both a heartwarming and a heartbreaking performance and only a masterful actress like Fernanda Montenegro has done full justice to the role by defining one of the greatest performances in cinema.It has been almost ten years after which I finally got the opportunity to revisit and re-experience this stunning piece of art. 'Central Do Brasil' easily ranks among my all time favourite films. It's simply one of the most beautiful films.",

One is given enough clues to understand that the effort will not end successfully in one respect, as the absent father's reputation seems to precede him as a drunkard and a louse. What one doesn't see coming is the fact that the man actually had another family, having married Josue's (Vin\u00edcius de Oliveira) mother after his first wife died. Not only did Josue not know his real father, he was not aware that he had two older step-brothers, one of which shared a similar disdain for his wayward parent. I was a little taken aback at how acerbic Josue was toward Mrs. Dora (Fernanda Montenegro) at first, calling her ugly for looking like a man and generally treating her with disrespect. It went both ways somewhat, but Dora's innate humanity eventually came forward to save a young soul who might otherwise have been cast to any manner of bad outcomes. As they grew to know one another a little better, you could feel the bond forming between them. If I had to guess, I would bet that Dora threw in that line in the letter she read from the missing father to Josue's mother, the one about desiring to live with her and his other sons, including Josue. The kid wasn't buying it, but for the viewer, I think it remains in the eye of the beholder.With all that went before, I thought the ending was somewhat abrupt, but then again, that's how life goes sometimes. Though it wasn't necessarily a 'happy ever after' conclusion, one comes away with a warm feeling that the young boy Josue would not be left to a heartless world as long as understanding individuals like Mrs. Dora were around.",

Behind the apparent serenity of the cinematic eye, calmly following the abject and the divine that are mixed together, behind this is a burning, passionate belief in the infinite capacity of redemption that's hidden in us. Says movie director Walter Salles, \"I come from a country and a continent whose identity is in the making, where things are not yet crystallized.\" And that's true for each of his personages; like their country, their characters are on the making, they are on the road. The kid, Josu\u00e9 (played incredibly by Vinicius de Oliveira, a shoe shine boy found by Walter Salles on the street), can become a crock, like old Dora (the great Brazilian actress Fernanda Montenegro). After all also Dora came in life from a similar childhood. Anything can happen, and the movie does not want to say us explicitly what will be with them in the future. The end of the movie is open potentially to any outcome, however the tone is optimist. The director doesn't know what will happen to Josu\u00e9 and to Dora; however he cannot look at their adventures but with an immense sympathy, for Josu\u00e9 is looking for his father while Dora is looking for her chance in life, and on the road they open themselves more and more one to the other. A road where picaresque happenings come one after the other, abjection and unexpected humanity, mishaps in a chain solved by unexpected miracles, it's Brazil, land of extremes, open, like Josu\u00e9 and Dora, to any future, a country followed by the eye of Salles with an immense sympathy, because the country is also on the road, like the heroes. And says again Walter Salles, \"I don't think we can say what the Latin American identity is, but I think we can try to look for the reverberations from it\"... and for this, \"you have to try to capture reality as it happens.\"",

I always used to think India and Brazil have great connection at least when the world calls these countries as \"BRIC\" economy and countries to watch out for. Well after seeing Central Station , I saw that Brazil is full of life - just like India - same dense population , same cut-throat living competition , every day existence driving goodness out of even among good people. I also saw that the Brazilian people were deeply religious as shown in movie and everywhere there were pictures of Mother - Mary. And all this when interwoven with the reality that the director Walter tried to paint , I liked the whole lot. I think the plot was good and touching but I do not think it was over stepped on sentimentality. It was just the correct doze. Fernanda Montenegro was a treat to watch. while story , the plot of a con-woman ( not intrinsically) interwoven with an young boy made orphan by a sudden twist of fate is good to watch with great scenarios of Brazil - I really fell in love with the background location - I felt that the movie moved a little slow. But then the director was in control and he delivered. This is a movie that one must watch at least once in life time. what type of genre is this movie ?. - It's about life - every day existence in every part of the world and not just Brazil. It can happen in US too - only that Hollywood do not have the courage to make these type of movies.... My rating - 8 /10. Reduced only for slowness",

            "content": "it is amazing the ability of director Water Salles to play at the heartstrings with such painful eloquence; fluid in a sense that the ubiquitous issues explored within the context of the film \"Central Do Brazil\" or \"Central Station\" were secondary to the road trip of two lives intersecting at a train station; a place where people come and go on their own subjective way.to be honest I couldn't tell if Walter Salles view on religion were pro or con; even after the continues repetition of religious symbols. At first it appeared to be in the positive based on the premise that images of piousness, self-sacrifice, or charity were themes played throughout the film in association with religion. It appeared that Salles was making a connection that man is on a quest for enlightenment through the interconnectedness of different modes of transportation that bring humanity as one; be it a pilgrimage of Christians; or two unlikely partners on a bus, train or truck, in search of unanswered questions. The recurrent images seemed to try to make a link of these two examples.dora seemed to be the only heathen in this quest, which in retrospect seems to be Salles possible speaker for the truth. From spectator feelings of ambivalence to hatred, and coming full circle to being the hero of the story, we see acts of courage in Dora's transformation from the poster boy of everything ugly in Brazil, to the embodiment of true altruism. She is the \"clarity\" in a convoluted Brazil - or humanity - who is left on its own without the so-called benefits and safety of civil society or an absolute dogma.in Central Station, we are like flocks of migrating birds together for safety from an indeterminate existence; in search of intangibles be it love, god, or an answer for mass suffering. It is not mans fault that he is drawn to mysticism to heal the wounds of poverty but it is the fault of society and the unequal distribution of wealth that leaves the majority scraping for leftovers.",

This is not an action/adventure movie, but rather a slow contemplative character study and tale of an orphaned boy looking for his lost family and an older woman who is helping him while herself searching for what she lost -- namely her humanity, hope, dreams, and empathy.This film reminds us that we all long for things, especially as we age and those things seem further and further out of reach, but the yearning still exists nonetheless for that which is good, familiar, and pleasing. While we can't all acquire nor keep all that we wish to in this life, that is ok; just knowing who you are, where you came from, and what you want is something -- something that can perhaps be reacquired and fulfilled in another lifetime, or at least such a hope for resurrection you may have.Also, note how this movie has two levels of meaning simultaneously, one literal and one metaphorical. The orphaned boy and the world-weary woman are each of us as we are all metaphorical orphans in this world temporarily separated from God the Father and Jesus Christ. Notice how the father's name is Jesus and he is a carpenter and how they await his possible return. And the brothers' names are Moses and Isaiah -- biblical prophets and they live in a town called \"estrella norte\" (north star = lodestar) and other cities mentioned are Bom Jesus ... (Good Jesus) and so forth. And like the other pilgrims shown they are searching Brazil for their Father/Jesus. It is replete with religious imagery set against stunning Brazilian locales.Bottom line: if you haven't seen this film, it is worth watching; it's an intense and emotive movie. And if you are into these sorts of slower character driven movies then this is one you probably want to own. My rating 10/10.",

There are so many conflicts in the film. Dora's TV, her childless life, Dora's opportunistic behavior, Josue is no innocent character either.

            "content": "Salles' picture of Brazil is that of a land of conflict in this road movie. The characters in this film are often harsh, and with good reason. Poverty reaches throughout this world, and the consequences of that poverty touch everything and everyone here. Tragedy affects everyone in some way, and the occasional good fortune often is temporary. The rare friendships found here are usually of the \"tough love\" variety. The primary relationship here, Dora's friendship with young Josu\u00e9, is a tenuous one initially, based on some sense of mutual obligation but rarely on genuine affection until later in the film. Other relationships, both temporary and permanent, seem largely based on convenience or circumstance.The environment is quite contradictory. The viewer is presented with noisy urban scenes of dirty, overcrowded trains and images of cramped villages, rife with poverty and desperation. Close shots and numerous indoor scenes create an overall claustrophobic feel while adding focus to the characters themselves. Wide shots of the gorgeous Brazilian countryside are also occasionally included, showing the viewer that all is not dust, grime and desperation. Sadly, these beautiful vistas are ignored by the characters; they have more urgent matters to attend to.Numerous Christian symbols pervade the movie. It is easy to see the symbolism in Josu\u00e9's quest to find Jesus (his father), guided by a single mother figure who could potentially represent Mary. However, the roles are often turned upside down, as this \"mother\" is far from saintly. All the same, the bitter Dora, who often comes across as downright evil, ultimately does the right thing, which is more than can be said for many of the ostensible Christians seen in the film, who eat in front of the obviously hungry, ignore the sick and abandon those in desperate need. There's a lot that can be read from this movie from a religious standpoint, regardless of one's beliefs.While Montenegro is perfect in her role as Dora, the acting throughout is top-notch. The ending, while heartbreaking, makes perfect sense in context of the characters and situations. This is definitely one worth watching.",

In this respect the film is inspirational.For her to come to this Renaissance of life Dora has had to learn how to survive by immoral methods - charging illiterate people money to write letters for them, which she never sends. However this does not make Dora innately immoral. She has become immoral because she is an older single woman, without children - thereby going against the grain of acceptable social norms - who needs to exist in a patriarchal world, in a relatively poor country. This has made Dora bitter, and subsequently hard in her emotions.But underneath all her hardness, Dora exudes humanity, which is an innate trait in her which surfaces, and ultimately triumphs. This here is the moral lesson of the film, which Director Sallis manages to illustrate very well.

It is the story of two outcast characters developing friendship and dear commitment to each other's wellbeing while allowing us a glance at socio-cultural circumstances and contemporary struggles of simple people.

The young boy gave such a wonderful performance, as did Fernanda Montenegro (who, together with Cate Blanchett, deserved the Oscar). This is a touching story about the relationship of a young orphaned boy and a poor letter writer, who together go on a journey to find the boy's long lost father. On the way they encounter interesting people and experience unforgettable experiences. Through out the movie we see superb acting and beautiful views of Brazil.

            "content": "In order to review this movie and explain what I didn't like about it, I had to reveal some plot elements that might spoil it for those who have not seen it (including the ending). So, please read ahead only if you want to.Central Station / Central do Brasil is a film about a boy whose mother is hit and killed by a bus and he has nowhere to go but to a dishonest elderly woman who earns a living by writing letters for illiterate people. She doesn't actually send the letters, though. The reason for this is not entirely explained although we are given her reasons from a few cases.If you are a \"realist\" movie-goer you won't like the beginning of the film. You would expect that, after the boy's mother is killed, the police would show up who would locate the boy's relatives and place him at a home. We never see any police, not even an ambulance arrive on the scene. A little later, someone steals some food and runs off. He is chased by a man who shoots him. Again, where are the police? There are not even any security guards at the station as you would expect.The film kind of gets going after this. After almost selling the boy (possibly for body parts?) we see the couple embarking on a quest to find the boy's father. We get to see the absolutely beautiful Brazilian countryside and the interesting characters that the woman and the boy encounter in their travels. We also see how the film uses the characters and events to make reference to Christianity (the boy's father is named Jesus and he is trying to find him).However, when the boy, does find his two half-brothers, for some unexplained reason, the boy and woman keep it from them that this is their lost little brother whom they had been expecting. We WANT to see the joy on the faces of these two older brothers when they learn that this is him. But we never get to see this. We are led to believe that they are to find out when the old woman leaves, dropping off a letter the boy's mother wrote to his father before she was killed (although the two brothers were illiterate, but there was supposedly a picture of mom and son in the envelope). In short, the emotionally constipated ending without resolution leaves the viewer disappointed.**1/2 out of **** (fairly good)",

            "content": "A tender, heartfelt & achingly human story about the inherent goodness in all of us, Central Station (Central do Brasil) is ever watchful as it treads the clich\u00e9d roads of its genre and invests so much heart & soul into the bonding that develops between the two characters that we are completely on board with their journey and can fully relate to the change they bring about in one another.Directed by Walter Salles, the introductions are quick, the set-up is swift, and once the main plot kicks off, the emotional heft is provided by the careful balance it finds in the empathy & antipathy between its contrasting characters, both broken in their own ways. There are a few slow patches in the middle but it also adds more depth & richness to their individual arcs in addition to reinforcing their camaraderie.Inviting us on a road trip, the film's events are spread out from the crowded railway station of Rio deJaneiro to the sparsely populated townscapes and it also offers an insight into Brazil's culture, religion & social class. However, the film's real highlight is the spectacular performances from Fernanda Montenegro & Vin\u00edcius de Oliviera, especially the former who's an emotional powerhouse here, while the soulful score infuses its own subdued flavours into the final print.Overall, Central Station is simple, sensible storytelling at its most stimulating and is translated from script to screen with warmth & sincerity. Led by excellent showcase from its cast and steered by a director who knows how to keep the sentimentality in check and not overdo it, this eloquent & evocative drama about a young kid looking for his lost father and a dour middle-aged woman seeking a second chance at life is as hopeful as it is poignant & heartbreaking.

            "content": "This story happens in an impoverished area in Brazil. The buzzing, noisy central station is infatuated with people bustling for nothing but life necessities. To put it into more vulgar words, people's life is cheap. It can be seen in this film that a thief is shot dead by the vendor.It is this exact reason that makes this film even moving than, say, if it happens in The United states. When one is living in indecent conditions, one should be given more credit if s/he offers to help others.Isadora is such a woman. She is not a good person in a strict sense. After retirement as a primary school teacher, she makes ends meet by deceit, i.e. helping illiterate people write and send letters but tears up those letters back home. By fate, she is connected with a boy named Josue. Josue's mother, one of Dora's client, is killed in a road accident.After several mental struggles with herself, Dora decides to help Josue find his father according to the letter. On the long way to the kid's father, Dora and Josue's relationship turns better and better and finally they become friends.Shortly after they find the location of Josue's father, it comes the time for them to part from each other. Dora writes a letter to Josue and in this letter Dora asks Josue not to forget her.I think Dora wants to be remembered as she devotes her love to Josue particularly she does not have a happy childhood memory. Her fundamental humanity is awakened during this journey. Yet this selfless help is not a pleasant experience for Dora as she sees how Josue's father and brothers love little Josue which for sure reminds her of those painful childhood memories. Despite all, the awakened humanity impulses her to leave Josue to where he can grow up with love and care. In a sense, she chooses Josue to help finish her unfinished childhood dream for a caring father and family. Loving someone but letting someone fly to better places is a huge sacrifice yet the highest rank of love.Thus, Dora does not want to be forgotten. I remember one line extremely clearly, 'When you grow up and drive the truck one day, do not forget that I am the first one who let you sit behind the wheels.'",

            "review_title": "Brilliant character piece played out between two very different people on a long and rewarding journey.",
            "content": "Central Station begins with a shot of several large groups of people pouring out of train carriages and onto the platform at a local train station. The shot is linked to the next scene that takes place on ground level of the station, that being a pouring out of emotions that happens when several people partake in dictating letters to a woman they've never met but entrust to write down what they've said before mailing them off to the chosen address' of loved ones. Just in the opening, director Walter Salles foretells the spilling out of emotion the characters will go through in this film whilst, some might argue, bringing to attention the illiteracy problem that he believes plagues his native Brazil. The opening also goes a long way in establishing the protagonist of the film, a certain Dora (Montenegro), and how she is 'before' the film develops her.Central Station is, essentially, a road movie but it is one of the better road movies that I have ever seen. It is a humbling and thoroughly interesting piece that studies two people of binary oppositions in a situation that consistently pushes weight down on top of a delicate mindset that is possessed by the protagonist. As a character, Dora is initially unlikable. She spends her days writing out letters dictated to her by illiterate people but rarely posts them to their respective addresses. She is friendless, bar a loose woman named Irene (P\u00eara) whom visits from the apartment downstairs, and does not have any family or pets. But what makes Central Station so memorable is the gradual changes Dora undergoes in order to become a better person and this is accomplished through the time she spends with a very young boy named Josu\u00e9 (de Oliveira).So the film is a character study, made in a language that is not of the English variety and stretches out to a little bit under two hours. But what brought it its success, I think, is its familiarity in regards to structure, a constantly shifting film that moves on down its single strand arc, effortlessly gliding from location to location and setup to pay-off. The beginning of Dora's transformation occurs not so far from her own door given how many miles she must travel in this film. She witnesses a young boy steal something from a stand before he is chased by security and mercilessly shot in a desolate area near the station. The initial incident from the outside that interrupts Dora's life, which itself could constitute as the set up, is her acquiring of Josu\u00e9, when a tragedy befalls him. She figures he is helpless and may need to steal to live, similarly to what the prior, now dead, youth had to do also.The centre of the film revolves around Dora delivering Josu\u00e9 to his father, an address that she acquired a few days earlier when the boy's own mother dictated a letter to her. The character's goal is in a very remote and far off place, too many bus rides and truck lifts away to be reached in a relatively quick time. But complications to do with people having moved on or being missing equate to the two having to trek on to the point where it would be wiser to continue into the unknown rather than just turn back, since a certain point as been crossed.During this time, Dora will undergo a transformation. The ideas behind the film are perfectly captured by a truck driver, whose words double up as the film's entire study, something the author(s) wants to make quite clear. At one point, whilst driving flat out on the open road, the trucker exclaims that 'the open road has changed him'. Not only this but 'many times' when discussing his job and his experiences with Dora. Principally this is exactly the point. Central Station, being the 'road movie' that it is, allows two or slightly more persons to learn more about themselves as they travel on a continuous route of no return. This is the crux of the film as explained by an individual who is helpful for as long as he needs to be, states what he needs to state before being removed from the text once his kind-natured spirit is brought into repute for aiding in some shoplifting.Additionally, the boy Josu\u00e9 himself brings to both our and Dora's attention Dora's flaws. If the demonisation of Josu\u00e9's father is very much present as this uncaring and far away individual, who enjoyed being under the influence of alcohol, then the boy points out Dora bears a similar mindset with her attitudes to alcohol. The statement draws on parallels with the father, as this uncaring and quite solemn individual who doesn't see job through. Then we remember Dora's attitude to all the letters she wrote and to the people she took money off of, while she insulted them in the process. Is Dora any better than the boy's father? Did she ever stop to think of this? Perhaps the father is a better person for at least he, as pointed out by the boy, could mould wood and earn a living out of a skill.While thoroughly engaging and always interesting as interactions and situations are played out, Central Station takes time to develop exchanges and studies like all great, slow-burning character studies do. The film is rewarding in a spiritual, dramatic and emotional sense and it could quite feasibly be labelled as one of the better films to ever come out of South America.",

Both were written (story) and directed by the same person, in this case Walter Salle whose work I look forward to seeing more of.  Both have wonderful child actors, in this case extremely talented beautiful boy, Vinicius De Oliveira, who in my opinion stole the show.  If I remember both boys were even named Josue as well.  I again look forward to seeing his career develop.  Both stories are about selfless love, albeit in this film a developing acquired one.  And of course in both cases this love had to overcome many obstacles.  I do not want to fail to mention Fernanda Montenegro's wonderful portrayal of Dora, a jaded self- centered letter writer whose character evolves slowly and believably.  Both have somewhat bittersweet endings as well.  I do not mean in any way to belittle this film by making comparisons for it is fantastic in its own right ,and I highly recommend it to any and all.

            "content": "I had been familiar with director Walter Salles from a long forgotten affection his 2004 travelogue The Motorcycle Diaries, a film I adored the first time but have not felt myself drawn to since. However, i still remember it fondly, and the differences between its contemporary rugged style and the vintage and cinematic Central Station are striking. Albeit, there is still a journey involved, an emotionally and physically exhausting journey, this is just through a different lens. The centrepiece of Central Station is the remarkable performance from veteran Brazilian actress Fernanda Montenegro. She's compassionate yet judgmental, kind-hearted yet mean-spirited. It's a delicately dimensional character haunted by the demons of her early life bolstered by a forceful performance that surely deserved more attention than it did in 1998.Her support isn't quite as strong however, but her bonds with them certainly are. While the wayward route is probably the best choice to portray the small boy that she takes on to return to his father, he is inherently irritating for his rowdy behaviour. This makes her plight all the more sympathetic as we questions whether the sacrifices she made for such an agitator outweigh the good deed. It's got interesting themes on family, regarding roles and structures. It's wonderful to see a small accidental family form as they meet a generous man who helps them for a small portion of the way, but of whom swiftly abandons them without reason. It illustrates how painfully fleeting these relationships can be. It does feel distinctly anti-male due to these representations, but it is the point the film is trying to make about the emotional poverty it causes.The film is full of atmosphere with sweeping cinematography capturing the heat of Brazil and the density of its population while they weave in and out of frame. Even with the company, it's hard not to feel alone. However, some scenes do feel a little forced in the direction, breaking the spell of reality that some human moments have, such as overblown conflict between the two characters before their eventual kinship. It makes storytelling sense for them to go through it and the film is richly written in that regard, but it could've been handled better. It also suffers from a trite motif in the score that tries too hard to jerk tears but it's easily ignorable. Central Station is a heart warming and heart breaking film that's among the best Brazil has to offer, especially in its leading lady.8/10",

(but not country, but soul) Here in Brazil everybody was saying that that movie was incredible, touching, beautiful.... When I went to the cinema I didn't thought all this. I thought only Central do Brasil as a good film, as a mark in Brazilian cinema history. But since the beginning I found Life is Beautiful better. Some months later, I went here and gave 7 to C do B. But after I've read other user's comments I decided to change it to 6. \"Now I know the truth about Brazil\". \"I knew the situation in Brazil was bad, but now I see that it's serious\", 'We can see Brazil as it is\" and other comments like this. I screamed to myself: Do that European and American people really believe that Brazil is that horrible monster they have shown in the film? Unbelievable! Central do Brasil doesn't show Brazil as it is. Do you think Brazil is so poor, so ugly, so dry as they show in the movie? How could us be the 7th richer country in the world in money circulating? How could us be the 4th in number of shopping centers? How could S\u00e3o Paulo and my city have less than 2 people for each car? How could S\u00e3o Paulo have one of the most polluted airs in the world if there isn't in your minds any car or industry in Brasil? How could the 4th biggest McDonald's in the world be here (yes, we have McDonald's, actually 700)? How could us have 4.000.000 PC  connected to the web? How could us have the biggest hydroeletric in the world if nobody have energy in the houses? How could I be writing in English (bad English!) if in the film looks that nobody in Brazil knows how to read or write? You don't even know that 98% of the children of Brazil are in school now. I don't think Central do Brasil is a bad film but it only helps in the preconception that you richs have. Don't watch Central do Brasil and say that Brasil is poor or anything. Try to use the web to research and discover that we are better, very much better than everything you think about us.",

When their paths cross following the accidental death of Josu\u00e9's mother, they are forced to form an unlikely bond as they travel across Brasil in search of Josu\u00e9's father. The cinematography is breathtaking, revealing the true beauty and wonder that resides within the Brazilian borders. Likewise, I believe the relationship that develops between Dora and Josu\u00e9 to be just as beautiful, portraying two people who want nothing to do with one another, yet, who need each other in order to discover the truths of life's journey. Moreover, the various people and situations they encounter on their search for Jes\u00fas, Josu\u00e9's father, add a rich eclecticism to the film. There is a deep symbolism present as well, which upon recognition causes the viewer to truly ponder its implications.

The retired teacher, Isadora, is neither warm nor motherly and the boy, Josu\u00e9, is neither receptive or desiring of her help. However, Isadora and Josu\u00e9 still embark on the seemingly hopeless journey in search of a father who may or may not be alive or around. The movie is by no means predictable, as demonstrated in the way that the characters do not personify those which audiences would expect to see in Hollywood movies dealing with similar plots. It is intriguing and captivating to watch how a stubborn and cold Isadora finds herself best friends with an equally stubborn and cold Josu\u00e9. Rather than their similarities creating a bond, they constantly drive each other away from the other, but in the end they find themselves forever changed by the remarkable friendship that formed between them. The genius of the movie rests in Salles' success in telling a story that is captivating and unpredictable. He is creative and unconventional and the product that results is phenomenal.",

            "content": "Having been born and raised in Rio and visited many other parts of Brazil and abroad, I have to recognize that the film is not completely accurate, but still very touching. Let's start with the inaccuracies: yes, teens and children are still murdered in the city slums, but it has more to do with drug dealing wars. Those absurd stories of having kids (and sometimes adults) kidnapped to have their organs extracted and sold in the black market are as untrue as it could be. However, crooks and con men and women like the ones presented there, trying to make some easy money from whatever they can find, is more than real. Another inaccuracy is the huge number of illiterate people who need Dora's help for writing their letters. Actually, nowadays and since a long time ago, you can hardly find real illiterate people in Rio. There are bunches of people who commit hundreds of grammar and spelling mistakes, but they're perfectly able to express their ideas on paper. Inaccurate facts apart, it is one of the most beautiful stories of love and friendship that has ever been set on screen. And the best of all is that, to become nominee for the Academy Award, it didn't need CGI, the appealing clich\u00e9 of violence and sex, which is almost always expected from Brazilian movies. Dora's suffered and empty heart and unorthodox honesty input by a whole life of deceptions, changes as she spends time with little Josue and she finds space to become a much better person. It's been almost twenty years since I first watched Central Station, but I still can clearly remember leaving the theater surrounded by hordes of women crying and men pretending not to. Frankly speaking, for a very long time, I refused to watch the Italian \"Life is beautiful\" by super-talented writer, director and actor Roberto Begnini just because it had defeated \"Central Station\" in the Academy Award, nevertheless when my prejudice was finally gone, I had to recognize a respectful rival. What didn't make any sense was Gwyneth Paltrow's artificial and almost amateur acting in \"Shakespeare in Love\" having defeated Fernanda Montenegro who really rocked, as usual. So, if you want to enjoy a touching and realistic film which will probably have you in tears, give it a try and take a couple hours to watch this masterpiece of the Brazilian movie industry.",

            "content": "Central Station's story is about as original as the story of Adam & Eve, so it's to it's credit that it manages to draw you in and keep you absorbed while avoiding the stereotypical and/or sentimental pitfalls that so often diminish the road/quest movie.Fernanda Montenegro plays Dora, a jaundiced ex-teacher who writes letters on behalf of the poor and illiterate at Rio's Central Station, but rarely posts them as promised. One of her clients is the young mother of a nine-year-old boy who wants to introduce her son to his absent father. When the mother is run down by a coach outside the station, Dora 'adopts' the boy, initially to sell him to an adoption/organ-selling ring, but ultimately to help him find his father.The central theme of the story, as with most road movies, is the transformation of those undertaking the journey in question. While Dora's trek with feisty young Josue (an engaging Vinicius de Oliveira) is plagued with setbacks and disappointments (not least of which is a sad, almost pathetic, encounter with a truck driver that is acutely observed), the unlikely couple's adventures work to restore her faith in herself and others.This being a Brazilian movie, religion plays a major part in the film. Its early scenes, in which the letters dictated to Dora are all selfish or reproachful, emphasise the stimuli that have jaundiced her world-view. As she and Josue embark on their journey, the religious signposts become increasingly prominent, as if the pair themselves are on a pilgrimage (which, of a sort, they are) until the turning point in their relationship comes during a fraught religious festival. Penniless and hungry, Dora writes upbeat letters for people at the festival (aided by Josue who summons them to her desk) to raise some money and literally becomes a conduit to God, thus nearly completing both her spiritual and physical odyssey.The film ends on a warm note, with the final letter one of tenderness and generosity of spirit, but is mature enough to understand that no real-life transformation is complete: Dora may have reclaimed her humanity, but she still retains her human character, flaws and all.Apart from one short period that drags a little, the film tells its story at a pace that, while leisurely, is exactly right.",

It's easy to see why, at 69, she is the most popular film and legitimate theatre actress in Brazil.This is a story worth telling, lovingly and credibly told.  I stopped waiting for the emotional manipulations so predictable in Hollywood films with this sort of theme -- after a half hour or so I relaxed, knowing I'd be allowed to witness a story unfold on the screen without heavy-handed moralizing or sugar-coated characterizations.  This film was populated with human characters, not stereotypes.  Because of this it was possible to stay emotionally in touch with the two main characters and those in smaller roles throughout -- as each faced crises or morally ambiguent choices unpredictably but true to the characters as they were developed by time spent with them.Caught up in the tensions of the story line, I didn't fully appreciate the cinematography as much as on the second viewing.  I'll bet it strikes a particularly deep chord in its Brazilian audience.Such iconography so naturally blended into the film visually -- the reverse Madonna and child, the religious ecstasy of the celebrants, the barrenness yet stubborn hopefulness in the prefabricated barracks-style freshly created \"communities\" in the countryside, the older and younger brother at the lathe, the summary execution of the young thief in the rail line...What a breath of fresh air this film was.  Superior to all its Oscar competitors, and I certainly would have awarded Best Actress to Montenegro!10 of 10. (only two films got that rating from me in '98)",

Montenegro's body language, her facial expressions, and the nuances of her speech are all tremendously evocative and effective in expressing Dora's loneliness, pride, toughness and vulnerability.

While a national director has no obligation to 'explain' his country to the uninitiated, some of Salles' references can be opaque to the outsider.  The Central Station itself seems to represent a confluence of all the ghastly failures of modern Brazil from which our heros escape to find a kind of order.  Untranslated slogans permeate the film, placenames seem to be weightily resonant, characters and situations seem to belong more particularly to this culture.And yet the film has been acclaimed worldwide.  This is presumably because it uses that age-old universal structure - the quest.  The film actually conflates two in its storyline - the search of a young boy for his father (and hence, I presume, his place in society, masculinity, Brazilian heritage etc.), and an old woman's regaining her identity and humanity.When we first see Dora, she is a maliciously detached, cold, godlike figure, a letter-writer in a shockingly illiterate Brazil, mocking and abusing the unfortunates who put their trust in her.  At one point she sells the recently bereaved boy to buy a new TV.  Her tragedy is her frigid solipsism, and the film traces her emotional thawing, her move from an imperious, sterile, changeless present, to her recognition of her place in history (her reciting family memories), and her own identity as a woman who belongs to a community of others, accountable to others (see the many mirror scenes; her putting on lipstick to reclaim her feminity).  By the end she realises that letters and writing are not irrelevancies, but possessed of a fetishistic power, representing real people and hope.Her quest is heavily linked with religious imagery - she and the boy evoke the Madonna and child; the pair's bleakest moment is played out against a religious rally straight out of the Dark Ages. The very real power of this nocturnal scene, though, is revealed to be Elvis-like kitsch by daylight.The boy's quest, beginning like a Roald Dahl story with the almost whimsical death of a mother, is framed as a road-movie, heavily quoting those classics of the genre - THE SEARCHERS and PARIS, TEXAS.  His journey is an attempt to impose order on the chaos represented by Central Station, but life is less malleable than this.  Those films' conclusions are here reversed: the missing relative isn't found, but the hero does find a family.  Indeed, his father takes on the quality of a benevolent Godot-like figure.The film is saved from maudlin sentimentality (an unforgivably lush score softens any of the horrors the film hints at) by a refusal to simplify or seek easy closure; by a very ambiguous, problematic and arguably misogynistic ending; and by the remarkably tough perfomance of Fernanda Montenegro.  CENTRAL STATION is, however, too derivative and conservative to be considered a success.",

            "content": "Central Station is one of the most poignant films I have seen in a long time.There are two reasons I prefer to rent at the video store: being of typical English stock I loathe to show emotion in public, and second public theaters can't afford to play movies that don't pander to the lowest common denominator. That said, you won't see this film in an American theater; be glad then, because its too emotional and simply stated it emanates a core emotion too personal to be shared in public.I almost didn't rent this film. It's a subtitled Brazilian film, and having lived in Central Florida half my life I've become a bit biased toward rude Brazilian tourists. Then I noticed that my favorite video store carried over fifty copies of 'A Civil Action' and only four copies of this film. Only then did I know it had to be a good movie.First off, see this film under the right conditions. Preferably alone, with a plate of pasta and good bottle of cabernet. Second, turn up the color on your TV set. This film is a visual treat. Once you get over your western prejudice of all that which isn't new and gleaming and begin to pay attention to the beauty of the indomitable human spirit your exuberance cascades back onto what you initially presumed to be the ugly decay of poverty.This film is great exactly because I can't express in words the manifold emotions expressed through the eyes of a mature woman and a brutally honest child caught up in a city of people just trying to cope. If you live in a big city you'll surely understand why this woman doesn't just keep walking. Cities are full of cruel people who don't care to help themselves and aren't deserving of yours. This kid doesn't want her help and what's more he can see straight through all her city mask pretensions.There's an ineffable quality here. The milieu of poverty contrast so well with the richness of emotional honesty. If you were poor in your youth and now middle class you'd do well to consider seeing this. \"Don't trust anyone over thirty\", because most have sold there soul to 'get by'. Dora redeems hers by becoming the savior of this diamond that refuses to tarnish.My vote: 9 out of 10.A must see!",

But now, when it's being released all over the world, I will feel glad if I can induce people to see it when reading this comment, cause, until now, the film is vivid on my mind and in my heart because of the greatness of its scenes and also because of the care and the tenderness it borrows to the common ones, the ones who gets hardened by nowadays troubles.The first scene, when there are some illiterate poor people inside central station in Rio de Janeiro asking Dora to write the letters they cannot write, is overwhelming. The one when Dora pays attention to her femininity and decides to put on a new dress and some lipstick is very great too. And there are so many others before the unforgettable final...Aligned with \"Saving Private Ryan\", \"The Truman Show\", \"Jackie Brown\", \"Carne Tremula\", \"Karakter\", and some others this is one of the best films released here this year.

            "content": "A few months back, I watched Takeshi Kitano's KIKUJIRO. I thought it was sentimental but well-acted, nicely-filmed and original. I may have to take back that last adjective, because Kitano's film has a feeling of a remake of CENTRAL DO BRAZIL. A story of an immoral person gaining a change of character through his/her meeting and subsequent trip with a 9-year-old boy looking for a lost parent.Which brings me to CENTRAL DO BRAZIL. It's the tale of Dora (Fernanda Montenegra), who works in Rio's central station, writing letters for the city's numerous iliterate citizens. She is an immoral, cynical person, who often tears up or discards these letters, including one by a woman writing to her husband on behalf of her young son, Josue (Vincius de Olveira). But when the woman is killed in a car accident and Josue is orphaned, guilt drives Dora to take him under her wing. At first, she tries to sell him, but again her guilt makes her go back to him and she reluctantly agrees to take him up to the North of the country to find his father. She repeatedly tries to lose him but can't bring herself to and the journey becomes one of discovery for both of them: Josue of his roots, Dora of her long-dormant ability to love and show compassion. It is also a discovery of the country itself, for us and for the brazilians.\nIndeed, Brazil is a country undergoing great change, socially, religiously and morally and director Walter Salles turns a critical yet tender eye on the people and ways of this country, which is both beautiful and rotting, corrupt and yet full of goodness. The best evocation of this is Dora herself, but I could also refer to the lorry driver, a kind man, true to God and the principle of good will who nonetheless refuses to allow himself to love or open his heart.The film is also a reflexion on God and religion, rich with symbolism (something not present in KIKUJIRO). The two main characters resemble pilgrims and find spiritual strength in each other. The country itself, in its turmoil, turns to God for help. Help comes for some (Dora and Josue, for example), but whether it's God that gives it is for us to decide. It could be a deity or it could be mankind's own spirit, his inate goodness, often deeply buried under cynicism and anger. Salles gives no answer except this: man can do good, even the most apparently heartless, be it thanks to some outside force or to his own nature. I suppose it doesn't matter, provided we yield our jaded attitude in the end. In this way, no matter what, this is an optimistic film, full of hope, despite the bittersweet ending ( that almost had me in tears!).Apart from the fantastic story and interesting philosophical and theological reflexions, this film benefits from great direction. Salles is a master with the camera and CENTRAL DO BRAZIL becomes a tribute to Brazil's receding and tragic beauty. The contrast between the dark, corrupt heart of Rio and the countryside: so open, full of hope and dreams that just need working at, is remarkable. Thumbs up for Salles.The film also benefits from great acting, most noticeably from Montenegra and de Olveira. The chemistry between them is incredible. CENTRAL... also boasts a great score, moving and powerful.This is a great movie, cinematic poetry. Between Salles directing, the poignant story, the reflective subjects, the score and the acting, there is so much that makes this the number one film of 1998. Better than SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE by far!Uppers: 1)The poignant story; 2)Gives you things to think about; 3)Fantastic acting, especially from the two main stars, OSCAR-deserving stuff!; 4)Fabulous music; 5)Salles' directing: masterful, Kubrick-esque, a tribute to Brazil's tragically fading beauty; 6)The last scenes: bittersweet emotion; 7)The scenes with the lorry driverDowners: none of great importance.I recommend this to anyone with a heart and advise for all those that have lost touch with it.",

It is inconceivable to have a \"letter writing shop\" at a train station in the US. -- Another problem hinted on in this film is the plight of hundreds of thousands of street children, either orphaned or simply impoverished. One scene shows how a shop lifter is chased down and mercilessly shot.

After 30 years of mediocrity on Brazilian productions, this movie is one the very first quality movies, starting a new era, with decent stories and the virtual end of cheap nudity from the time of \"pornochanchadas\".The main plot, it's something seen even in many B American movies. The difference is how the story is told. It's about Dora (Fernanda Montenegro), an old woman who fooled simple minded and illiterate people from Northeast writing letters for them, keeping the money and not delivering the mail. Her fate changes when she meets Josu\u00e9 (Vin\u00edcius de Oliveira), a boy who had lost her mother, run down by a bus. Cold hearted at first, she goes with the kid for a trip heading Northeast to find the rest of his family.The movie's pace is something slow, as in many Brazilian movies, but it doesn't make you sleep, for sure. Since it's character movie, you enjoy every little scene they appear. Montenegro is our Prima Donna, doing her work superb as usual - if (argh!) Roberto Begnini won an Oscar, she would deserve 10; the boy was very realistic, even if his acting wasn't brilliant by that time - he did it fine, though; Mar\u00edlia Pera, one of my favorites, was gold-shining as that neighbor who helps Dora on escaping from the criminals - she has a real perfect comedy timing that beats even professional comedians; pay attention on Matheus Nachtergaele, playing one of Josu\u00e9's brothers and the always efficient and ready-for-the-action Ot\u00e1vio Augusto, as a corrupted police detective.I recommend this movie for all non-Brazilians so you can learn about the real thing.

When I say that Central Station is an absolute masterpiece of human emotion, that is only telling half of my true feelings. It is a cinematic experience that will stay with you forever.After the showing, one of the film's producers was in attendance to offer a question and answer period. My favorite story from that Q&A is as follows:There were approximately 700 young boys being considered at the time for the lead role in Central Station, but none of them really \"clicked\". Director Walter Salles was on his way by air to Sao Paulo. In the airport, a young shoeshine boy walked up to him and asked if he could borrow enough money to buy a sandwich, as he was hungry and not doing well that day shining shoes.

Sure, it did not win either Oscar, but that is still an impressive feat.According to Richard Schickel, the film is \"an odyssey of simple problems, simple emotional discoveries, a relationship full of knots that Salles permits to unwind in an unforced, unsentimental fashion. His imagery, like his storytelling, is clear, often unaffectedly lovely, and quietly, powerfully haunting.\" Beautifully said, Richard.

Though in the end the two of them develop an everlasting relationship, I feel this film focused on a Dora's identity. The personality of Dora is very much similar to the atmosphere of Rio De Janeiro. Working as a letter writer at the Central Station, she is seen as a cold hearted person, who only cares about her own well being. She hates having to deal with customers and the majority of the time she chooses not to mail the letters that people give to her. But that begins to change when Josue, a nine year old boy, comes into her life. With his mother passing away in a tragic accident, Dora assumes the maternal role for Josue, as they take part on a journey along the countryside to find his father. They go through a series of trials and tribulations throughout the film. And as the movie progresses, they begin to rely on one another. The film concludes with Josue finding his family and Dora returning home. The experience with Josue, molded Dora into a different person. She showed love and compassion for the boy. Two traits I never thought she had. In a world full of hatred and greed, Dora was given an opportunity to do good, and she came through. Though I wished the film would have had ended on a happier ending, Dora's letter to Josue showed her eternal love for him.",

            "content": "Amidst the hustle and bustle of Brazil's busy Central Station in Rio De Janeiro, a retired school teacher Dora (Fernanda Montenegro) sets up a table to script out letters dictated to her by a hodgepodge of illiterate people. They are writing lovers, enemies, and family and each is passionate in their anger or love as Dora writes out their letters. What none of these people realize is that this is as far as their letter will travel: to the home of Dora who shares the notes with her closest friend and then decides whether the letter will be thrown out, or if it is worthy of the purgatory drawer where letters rarely leave.The director, Walter Salles, is an expert of exhibiting reality in his films. In Central Do Brasil, he easily exposes the corruption in Brazilian society. The hardened Dora has no remorse over her deceit of taking money and not sending letters. It is seen on a larger scale when a thief shoplifts from a stand in the station and when he is caught, he's shot with no mercy or grace offered. When the owner of the merchandise stand returns to the station after killing the man, it is apparent that everyone knows what must have happened to the thief, but no one asks questions or looks for justice. Corruption is a way of life and Salles challenges his audience to ponder this.The plot is a simple one: true to real life with no distracting or unrealistic additions. Through her letter writing, Dora meets a boy, Josue (Vinicius de Oliveira) and his mother who are writing to a father he never knew. When Josue's mother suddenly dies, Dora feels sympathetic towards him and takes him into her home. Her worldview is hardened though, and so while her conscience insists that she can't leave him to become a thief in Central Station, she also does not see him as her problem and looks for a way to get rid of him that will be advantageous to her. Leaving him with a sketchy adoption agency, her conscience (often seen convincingly through her friend Irene-Pera), again convinces her that she cannot except blood money in exchange for the boy's life. But when her life and home suddenly in danger, Dora sees her only outlet as taking the boy to find his father in the north.This turns the film into one that fits in the \"road-trip\" genre: one that Salles executed well in this film and in his 2004 film Diarios de Motocicleta. The shots bring the viewer on the road with the actors, displaying the beauty and simpler life of the north of Brazil in contrast to the dirty and busy metropolis of Rio de Janeiro. Through Dora and Josue's journey, the themes of guilt, conscience, motherly love, family, religion, and adolescence are all explored and the excellent acting makes it easy to connect and relate to the characters. The scenes also add to the moment as they are shot to assist in making the story come to life. For example I really appreciated the filming of the scene where Dora loses Josue in a crowd of religious zealots during a ceremony. The camera follows her rushed movement and then when she enters a building with candles all around, the chaos of the filming makes you grieve even more for her situation as you feel the turmoil she is feeling.I would recommend this film to anyone in any walk or stage of life could find something to connect with. Meanwhile, the beautiful cinematography and award nominated acting make it a joy to watch.",

            "content": "Known in English as \"Central Station,\" this is an inconsistent film with a flawed premise. This is the first film in many a year that I watched because I had to rather than because I wanted to as it was assigned viewing for a Law and Film group of which I am a member. It is not the kind of film that I would ordinarily choose to watch as it is rather depressing in spite of its would-be moving moments. The script by Walter Salles can never seem to decide on a tone and, at the end of the day, I didn't care what happened to the characters, which is never a good sign. On the bright side, the film looks great and it was interesting to watch my first film in Portugeuse - and only my second entirely in a language other than English or German - but I wish that my introduction to Brazilian cinema had been more successful.Fernanda Montenegro is very good in the Oscar nominated role of Isadora \"Dora\" Teixeira and it is a shame that the film could not have been on the same level as her performance. A cynical, bitter retired teacher, she writes letters for illiterate people at the major Rio de Janiero train station Central do Brasil. Half the time, she does not even send the letters, either tearing them up or sticking them in a door which her friend Irene compares to Purgatory. After one of her customers, a woman named Ana Fontenele, is knocked down by a bus, she takes in her son Josu\u00e9 Fontenele de Paiva but it is not out of the goodness of her heart. She sells him to child traffickers for $1,000, which she then uses to buy a new TV. Dora is an intelligent, well-educated, perceptive woman so I find it very hard to believe that it had never occurred to her that he would be killed and his organs would be sold until Irene points it out to her. She then experiences a crisis of conscience and steals him away from the dreadful place where she sent him in the first place. The film is concerned with her supposed redemption but it did not work for me because I don't think that she could be redeemed after that.In order for me to find a character interesting, they have to be either sympathetic or compelling and, unfortunately, Dora was neither one. I don't have a problem with characters doing terrible things if the storyline is gripping or, far less often, if it is able to redeem them. For instance, I was fascinated by Judah Rosenthal's existential moral crisis after he became heavily involved in a murder in \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\", which I watched only last week, and Michael Corleone's gradual descent into darkness in the first two \"Godfather\" films is a beautifully told, engrossing story. The problem with this film is that I don't think anything that Dora did or perhaps even could go any way towards redeeming her. She clearly regretted it, which is something, but I think that committing the act was unforgivable and there is no way back from that. I had much the same problem with \"The Godfather Part III\" actually but that was far from its only flaw.Because of this, I did not find Dora's bond with Josu\u00e9 - who is played by the rather bad child actor Vin\u00edcius de Oliveira - very sweet or believable as I was presumably supposed to. Frankly, I could not get the child trafficking thing out of my head for a single second during the film. She warms to him and does admittedly become a better person as the film progresses but it can't erase what happened earlier. She embarks on a trip across Brazil with Josu\u00e9, albeit trying to abandon him several times along the way, so that he can find his father Jesus, a shiftless drunk who beat his mother while she was pregnant with him. Is this really all the poor child has going for him? He eventually finds his half-brothers, who are nice enough, but it is heavily implied that his father will never return in spite of a letter to the contrary. This is for the best as Josu\u00e9 might be able to actually experience real happiness, something which I certainly didn't while watching this film. Besides Montenagro, Mar\u00edlia P\u00eara, who sadly died in December, as Irene is the only actor who particularly stood out. Overall, the film hinges on being able to forgive Dora, which is a flawed premise in my view, so it did not do much for me, I'm afraid.",

Also, these comments are filled with preconceived ideas about how Brazil and brazilians are.That this movie was appreciated by hundreds of NB is a good sign. It proves that the director did a good job technically, that this movie's great soundtrack and camera shots were recognized by the movie audience worldwide.There are Brazilians whose comments sound much alike the NB simple minded comments. These comments analyze the movie by American Standards, which is absurd. This history would NEVER happen in the US, i'm sorry to say but Americans are too \"sellfish\", or individualists, to be in such a story. IF you want to watch american manners and culture, watch american movies! If you live in Texas, don't compare it to Brazil, don't even try to understand the movie. This movie requires either: a very open minded audience; or an audience that understands the brazilian way of life.For example: there were comments about the biblical names of the characters. Most brazilians, particularly in the northeast, are very religious and really have biblical names. It's not uncommon for brazilian parents to give all their children biblical names. It was not a \"Director's idea\" to give the characters biblical names so they would be easy to follow. It's true! But religion is not the \"only hope a burgeoning ccountry\", as a person from Texas states... This are the preconceived ideas that makes us brazilians mad.Some comments also mention the brazilian society and culture, which, believe me, is portraited VERY realistically by the film, and shows Brazil just the way it is: poor, religious, sometimes cruel, but most of the times compassionate and benevolent. This is what makes Brazil such a unique country, according to sociology, and the BEST country, in my opinion: although it sometimes is difficult to survive in Brazil, every one can sense the friendliness, always-ready-to-help initiative, and companionship off the brazilian people.The poor life condition of the majority of the brazilians makes them cruel, and sometimes dishonest, but their kind hearted approach to life makes the story of the movie true and realistic to any person that knows how brazilians REALLY are.Believe the film, it's a real portrait! The fact that no police shows in some scenes, when it should, is true! Police in Brazil is really very lame! The fact that a woman would sell a kid is true, it really happens, and it helps to show everybody a really brazilian approach to situations. No matter how tough is the situation, brazilians find a way around. It's the famous \"jeitinho brasileiro\", which has been exhaustingly explained by sociology. The \"jeitinho\" is often done in a good way, although the movie gives a mean (but true) example of it.Also don't consider the comment of a Brazilian Artemis, from Belo Horizonte, in this forum, who is ashamed of the real Brazil, and wants to make people believe that Brazil is such a developed country. This person is either very ignorant or very stupid, because the Brazil she describes is only true for a minority of the brazilian people: the ones that live in big Cities, like S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio, and that have MONEY.Brazil is a great country, the best, but it's far from developed.

Scenes like the faces of those people who ask Dora for the letters are enough reason to drop tears from the watcher's eyes... The dialogues are intense and deep. The photography is perfect, the actors are unique and Salles deserves at least a very loud scream: Congratulations! And thank you for giving us all this happiness...",

            "review_title": "A Story of Two Strangers",
            "content": "Central Station is a touching story about two strangers from different walks of life who journey through the dustbowl of Rio de Janeiro to find that they have more in common with each other than they initially realized. Dora is an elderly, retired school teacher who's never been married and is jaded towards most people. She sort of has a Travis Bickle mentality\u2014believes most people are \"trash\" and that it's her job to clean things up. She demonstrates this by refusing to mail the letters she writes for the illiterate populace of Brazil, saying that it would only \"worsen\" things if such people actually received these letters. Josue is an intuitive and sly 10-year old boy without a mother who's in search of his father who left him years ago. He sees right through Dora's depraved behavior and calls her out on it. Together, the two take a journey into the heart of Brazil in search of Josue's father.The significance of their journey applies to the common bond between them. They both suffer from loss. Dora's loss is manifold: her lost opportunities to marry and have children, the loss of her feeling beautiful, the loss of her enthusiasm for life, etc. Josue's loss is two-fold: the loss of his mother after her accidental death, and the loss of his father, Jesus, who left him years ago. Succinctly put, both of them suffer from a loss of love. On their journey, both are able to play certain roles to help fill these voids in their life with love. Dora acts as a surrogate mother to Josue, takes him under her wing as she tries to help him find his father. Josue indirectly acts as the child Dora never had, allowing her an opportunity to break her selfish shell. Both, however, are reluctant and cynical towards each other at the beginning. Dora keeps trying to abandon the responsibility of caring for Josue (i.e. when she tries to leave him sleeping on the bus), while Josue keeps reprimanding Dora for not acting her age (i.e. when he scolds her for stealing food at the grocery mart). These sequences demonstrate the power of role-modeling. Both are indirectly guiding the other to find what they need most: care and love from each other. The film seems to suggest that Dora's never had a positive male influence in her life, nor does she feel beautiful enough to qualify for one. Consequently, what she needs most is a \"real man\" who will help her out of the Scrooge-like cave she's created for herself.Without money and without a travel ticket, Dora's poor example leads Josue to lose hope in any caretaker. The specific moment of change that converts Dora to start really caring for Josue (rather than treating him as heavy baggage) is when he runs away from her through the crowded, religious chanting streets of the Brazilian countryside. This scene is ironic: Josue runs away to find his father, Jesus, the crowd of people pray to God with hopes to be redeemed through Jesus, and Dora needs the love/reassurance of a Jesus-figure in her life but doesn't realize it. The swirling camera movements used as she roams through the sacred room of burning candles and crucifix's suggests what's taking place inside her mind\u2014she's losing control of her life as she has lost control of Josue. It's as if the unsteady camera movements act as the pangs of her racked conscience, causing her to realize her poor role-modeling qualities. When she recovers, she wakes up in the arms of Josue outside\u2014their relationship has grown for the better (Josue realizing he's loved, and Dora realizing she has to love).The theme of the film says a lot about how we project certain images upon people when we're younger, only later to realize how false those images are when we grow older. For example, Josue believes his father is really a good-spirited man who loves his children. However, all the rumors told about his father say the opposite: that he's a drunkard; a no good beggar who sold his life for hedonistic pleasures when the going got tough. I think this idea also compliments how God is viewed in this film. During the chanting scene in the countryside, groups of suffering people gather together to pray for release from their pain, but it seems to be futile\u2014they are not released from pain. It seems, then, that the film is making some type of commentary on what happens when the father's in our lives\u2014be they mortal or divine\u2014leave people on their own without care.",

For the most part, CENTRAL STATION is an engaging film, and while it is a tad predictable(we know Dora and the little boy are going to become friends before the movie is over), director Walter Salles allows us to go into the personal journeys of each character, more than a U.S. film usually does, which makes it deeper.  Both lead actors are also terrific, which helps.  I haven't seen too many films from South America(off the top of my head, I can only think of PIXOTE, DONA FLOR AND HER TWO HUSBANDS, and THE OFFICIAL STORY), but based on those, I definitely hope to see some more.",

Dora is a very complex woman, she's good and she's bad, she's strong and she's vulnerable. It must have been an actress's dream to read a script with such a complex female character. And Fernanda Montenegro does a really good job and would probably have been a more deserving winner of the Academy Award than Gwyneth Paltrow. The film is good, although I found it difficult in the beginning to be engrossed by what was going on and afterwards I was still confused by the fact that Dora never sent the letters that she was paid to send. Did I miss something? Was there something that I didn't understand? She had no motivation whatsoever for tearing up the letters and that is a serious lack in the script. Overall, though, \"Central do Brasil\" is a touching and heart-warming film. (6/10)",

            "content": "Although the soundtrack is very irritating and doesn't jibe well with the on screen \"action\", it's the least of this poorly developed movie's problems. It's odd because the script, being quite implausible, could still have worked with some competent direction. But it doesn't happen here. The acting is just a bit overdone and corny, actually. The situations as they develop are just too convenient and contrived, and don't unfold into any sort of credibility. The old lady is kind of a hearless creature, writing letters for money with no intention of delivering the letters. And selling a kid to the who is obviously shady people is certainly not going to endear a character to anyone. Strolling in and just taking him away is not realistic. She leaves with the kid, but somehow the bad guys can't seem to exit their own apartment to give chase. It's that kind of hokey vibe that permeates this film. It ends up being just a sappy, mushy story with nobody acting in sensible ways. Honestly, the kid is a brat! A demanding, whining sniveling toad. There' s a trucker who really drags the film down with his saintly demeanor who instantly takes to the main characters who steal and generally take advantage of people's good nature. No, it just doesn't work for me. And her friend back in the city is equally annoying with her over the top portrayal of a matronly figure. It views like a very bad television show. VERY bad. Onerdone, ridiculous nonsense chock full of characters who are either not likeable or simply badly written. I swear that old lady didn't deserve any sort of recognition for this clunker. This country simply has to have more to offer than this sort of simple minded drivel. Did I mention inane dialogue? A star for some country shots on their dumb journey to track down his deadbeat loser father. The bonds forged between characters are shallow and never once did I feel absorbed in the plot or care one way or another what happened to them. Waaayyy too much violins. What were they thinking? Awful beyond rank. Just a depressing tale about hopeless lost souls who seem to be clueless about how to go about their lives. If that brat told us about how his dad is a carpenter one more time I was gonna hurl the TV into a lake. The lighting was too bright but the editing was adequate. The director's vision of how this film should look was off, and midway through I was reaching for my phone to check emails. The good points were simply not good enough to maintain any emotion. Points can be made in a subtle fashion. The way they end up lashing out and being nasty to each other are eye rolling as well. Horrendous movie. The praise heaped upon it is confounding to say the least. It starts bad and when you think it can't get worse and you can't take any more the level of absurdity gets ramped up another few notches. It's not artistic it's just plain lame. If I could go back in time I'd skip it altogether. I've sat through it a few times and it gets worse with each viewing. I won't be making that mistake again. It's proved it's worthlessness to me once and for all with this last watch.",

            "content": "It's great seeing a film about simple people, their hopes, decisions, and feelings -- a type of story Hollywood rarely does these days.  They're too busy blowing things up and crafting narcissistic vehicles for over-priced stars.  CENTRAL STATION is well-written and directed, and beautifully acted, especially by Montenegro, but I have one problem with it:Sentimentality -- making life sweeter than it is -- may have marred films at one time, but it's been out-of-fashion for decades.  CENTRAL STATION shows what replaced it: a pseudo-tough anti-sentimentality that's just as false and clich\u00e9d.Real life contains hope and despair, bright and dark.  The greatest writers, like Shakespeare or Tolstoy, show it all to you.  But CENTRAL STATION, like so many modern plays and films, projects a two-dimensional negativity, as if ugliness, hatred, injustice, and pain are the only true reality.  The trouble is, this viewpoint is as false as pretending life is a bed of roses.The filmmaker's fear of sentimentality warps his story so that parts of it make no sense.  Dora is established as a woman hardened by a tough childhood and the cruelty of Third World lawlessness and poverty.  She has become cold, selfish, and amoral.  The story shows us how reluctantly caring for an orphan boy ends up humanizing her.A fine, if not terribly original, idea.  But the film won't let Dora change *enough*.  Fearing sentimentality, the filmmaker shows her heart melting and then doing things so cold they make no sense in the context of her changed way of thinking.Near the end of the film, when Dora has begun to know compassion and self-sacrifice, she is pointlessly cold to her only friend, a kindly woman named Irene.  Then she callously abandons the boy without even saying goodbye.Her decision to do this makes no sense.  She has no life to go back to. It's obvious the best thing she could do is live with the three illiterate, abandoned brothers, at least for a while, to help raise and care for them. But the film won't let her do it.Instead, she flees -- which makes no sense, especially after she's told Irene she wants to settle somewhere far from Rio.This ending is \"fashionably bleak\" and completely artificial.  It doesn't affect us emotionally because it doesn't follow from what's come before. Equally unrealistic is the final shot of the boy smiling through tears as he somehow understands why Dora has abandoned him.  How can he understand what makes no sense?  This boy has been abandoned by everyone in his life -- that Dora does it to him again is meaninglessly cruel.  His tearful \"understanding\" is sentimental anti-sentimentality at its worst.Films used to have artificial happy endings tacked on, to please audiences. CENTRAL STATION has an artificially bleak ending tacked on, to please critics.  This film, good as it is, shows how anti-sentimentality can be just as false and phony as its opposite.",

            "content": "This, for me, is a film about holiness, because it offers whatever we may have worthy of grace without excuses or embroidery of any kind.  Set in Brazil, the central characters could have been from anywhere because they are fully human with all the frailties, uncertainties, and imperfect relationships that we all share.  Fernanda Montenegro plays Dora, a train station vendor who writes letters for the illiterate poor in Rio de Janeiro. Dora is selfish, cynical, and contemptuous of her patrons.  She takes all the letters she writes home with her, opens them and laughs about them with her best friend before discarding them.  Montenegro gives an unembellished portrait of Dora, exalting her by telling the truth rather than by glamorizing any part of her life or actions.  Dora comes to know and gradually care about Josu\u00e9, the young son of one of her patrons, after his Mother is killed in a freak accident.   Their personal and her emotional journey form the bulk of the picture.The film shows the harsh things they say and do to each other in the course of finding their way to some resolution.  One scene presents a festival of lights where thousands of pilgrims are praying for God's help.  In the midst of this crowd, Dora has told the boy that he is worthless and a burden, and then tries to find him after he runs off.  Neither is praying for help, but, in the stark cruelty and pettiness of their immediate past, they are nonetheless stripped bare of all pious defenses as are all petitioning before the judgment seat of God.  Whatever we may be worth is calculated in the lives we touch and whatever of meaningful value we take with us in life is built on our relationships with others.  \"Central Station\" divines this common holiness by depicting real people with nothing to fall back on but each other and the kindness of strangers. After reading the comments from others describing this as just another road movie or yet another child in danger accompanied by an adult, I realized that most people were not finding the same things I did. The closest films to this, in my experience, are not the overtly sentimental films like \"Gloria\" or  \"Life is Beautiful,\" but films like \"The Conversation\" and the religious drama \"Strange Cargo.\"  \"Central Station\" does not play up the danger to and protection of Josu\u00e9, but concentrates on the transformation of Dora.  She does not have a heart of gold and her awakening to a new life is a human evolvement based on shared traumas, not a reward for altruism or heroism.  Gene Hackman gave a similarly affecting performance in \"The Conversation\" as an isolated security expert whose basic humanity was imprisoned behind his paranoia.  \"Strange Cargo\" followed a group of escaped convicts who in turn face or reject opportunities for redemption.  All three films share a respect for basic human nature rather than trying to make them or us more than we are. The denouement need not be a \"Christmas Carol\" transformation, just a visceral recognition of what is at stake when the soul is forgotten.",

To tell you the truth, I was a bit surprised at the quality of the film, having seen other attempts of Brazilian Cinema that made B Grade movies look like Oscar contenders.The only problem I had with the movie was the translation of some of the words.  If you don't speak Portuguese, you are none the wiser.  But, the \"F\" word was used several times unnecessarily.  And so were other cuss words. Now I know that translation can't be done word for word, but I object strongly to the unnecessary use of profanity.  I really don't get why this movie was rated \"R\" since I have seen movies that had much more profanity and dealt with more \"difficult\" topics get only a PG-13 rating.  I really think that perhaps if some of the \"added\" cuss words would have been dropped from the sub-titles, the rating would have been at most PG-13.Definitely a great movie, although not for all tastes.  I give it an 8 1/2 out of 10.  I would have rated it higher but the \"added\" profanity really makes me mad.I welcome your comments and would especially like to hear from any Brazilians or Portuguese speakers (ie people who have lived in Brazil) who live in the Greater Cincinnati (or thereabouts) area.",

But like the classic Black Orpheus, it also plays at a deeper mythic level.  The father of the three brothers (Joshua, Moses, and Isaiah) is a carpenter named Jesus.  He has disappeared \"in the wilderness\" and may or may not come back.  Throughout the film are images of Christianity, mostly of poor, desperate people seeking help and solace from their religion.  But it often seems that the line between religion and hucksterism is thin.  In a pivotal scene Dora wanders into a claustrophobic house of shrines and candles where she is overcome by hunger and fatigue.  Neither the shrines nor the seemingly drugged pilgrims help her.  But the boy Joshua cradles her in his arms.  (Joshua, of course, was the one who led the Israelites into the Promised Land to which Moses had brought them.)",

Dora and Josue are completely believable in their roles. I frequently return to watch this movie because it reminds me of the simple, beautiful bits of life that make all the rest of it worthwhile.The difficulty of life in Brasil accentuates how hard it is for Dora to turn from her selfishness to help Josue. On our journey with Josue and Dora across Brazil, we encounter a wide spectrum of Brazilian society and see the variety of reactions to the \"fome\" that's such a Brazilian reality. The glimpses that we get of real Brazilian people through Dora's letter writing scenes are some of the most memorable moments in the film.It you're ever in need of a \"goodness recharge\", watch this film again.",

But this is an Epic, in the classic sense, for the woman, not the boy. From the vast sprawling Metropolis of Rio, to the sprawling emptiness of the Sertao, she matures from the shriveled soul cheating people of their sent messages to a magnanimous matron who shows real agapai for the boy.

Let us see: they said that Dora released a job and a life to help a boy to find his father. But an important detail was forgotten in this comment: Dora decides to help (?) the boy \" to sell him \" for a gang that traffics children. So, she decides to help him because she can gain much money. Do you - dear reader - find this impossible? Brazilian and world news show us this is much more common than we can imagine. It's true that Dora regretted - after having been reproached for her neighbor and only friend Irene - and freed the boy. Remorse, guilt? This also happens - or not? Now, the fact of Dora to have travelled with the boy looking for his father was also not moved by no goodness. After her bravery act of freeing the boy, she started to be the target of a gang of the traffic. Which alternative for Dora, except running away from the city? All the remaining portion of the film also is coherent - mainly the final. We can't forget that Dora takes a needy existence, an old dismissed teacher that\" steals\" the customers (she receives money and doesn't post the letters) to live, without family, with just one friend. And talking about \" Life is Beautiful \", if we analyze it under the point of view that some analyzed the film of Walter Salles, we wouldn't see the movie: it's impossible to imagine that spree in a concentration camp! Put yourself in the place of that boy, prisoner for months, far of the mother... No joke of his father could make him happy as shown in the film. And certainty, nazi weren't so 'fool & funny' as \" Life \" showed. But, cinema is fancy, magic, and \" Life is Beautiful \" - although all the nonsenses - is moving. Therefore, it conquered the world. What also it happened with \" Central do Brasil \" - take a look at 'awards and nominations' at IMDb. That's all folks.",

Along the road, both characters shall undergo a change in their attitude: the lady will realize that you can use (and abuse) the ignorant and the poor only for as long as you find yourself by the lucky side of the fence and the child shall learn how to tell the difference between your real goal and the mental picture you have of it. The film also does not forget to remind us of the sad condition of the Brazilian children (the old lady initially sells the child to an organization of organ-sellers) and adolescents as well (a teenager is shot and killed for having robbed a valueless object) and - the director hints - religion and prayer are the only things left to the Brazilian (say the whole Third World) masses today, though there's an abyss between religion (all the people are equal...) and the cruel reality (...but some are more equal than the others). To correctly judge the film, I can not help but compare \"Central do Brasil\" to Solanas' \"El viaje\": the latter is a masterpiece, while the former is nothing more than sufficient. If this was Berlin '98's Golden Bear, then the average quality of the films had to be fairly poor there.",

If only some American-made movies were this good.Any supposed plot holes that people have supposedly found, aren't really true, it's just that some people didn't really understand what was happening.  Case in point...The reason Dora decided to help the boy was because she had just seen a street kid get shot.  She didn't want Josue to grow up on the street, and perhaps, meet the same ending.

While I am a big fan of foreign films, i.e. Cinema Paradiso, Il Postino, Toto le Heros, Como Agua para Chocolate, etc., I found this film to be too heavy for its own good.Perhaps it's my own cultural centrism speaking, but the constant sins of the female lead were too much for me to buy as redeemable. To knowingly sell the boy to be butchered for \"spare parts,\" when there is no clear desperation or need so drastic in the woman's life to demand such a heartless act, is unforgivable for me. I understand that there are people like this woman in the world, who make choices that include selling children to be murdered, but I don't find such people interesting enough to make stories about.Many comments on this movie describe it as enchanting and beautiful. I'm not sure what film they were watching. Urban blight and hollow souls aren't enchanting. This is a bleak, heavy-handed morality play, not a lyric visual feast.It's also a little too by the numbers. All the males get easy-to-follow Biblical names. The closing image of the two friends with the plastic saint transforms our crusty old maid into the Virgin Mary. However, the role of Christianity in this film, and in the Brazilian society it portrays still troubles me.This woman is not redeemed by faith, but by friendship - which the boy keeps thrusting upon her even though she gruffly drops him at every opportunity. However, we are Oliver-Stoned with religious imagery and religious people in the film. Is religion the opiate of abused peasants? Is it the single hope of a burgeoning nation?I don't know after seeing this film, and I don't think the director does, either. The devout in the film seem to be happy, but Dora is rewarded for her sins without ever making any leap of faith. Yes, she makes it to the end of the journey, but only because she's stranded without money (b/c of yet another selfish attempt to ditch the boy), and has to stay the course with Josue b/c she has no other choice.I don't want to condemn this film, but it is certainly not one of the best films of all time, nor even of 1998. Shakespeare in Love won awards for itself and its actors because it was written by the finest living writer of the English language, Tom Stoppard. Rushmore, an even better film, told a much funnier and more compelling story than Central Station of two flawed characters in need of redemption, who believably fight their way to a unique friendship.Central Station is an achievement - it is not afraid to show the frightening truth about homeless orphans in Brazil, but it fails to illicit more than pity from this viewer. It resorts to cheap emotional tricks (what I call \"poking a puppy with a stick\") where the film intentionally tortures the sad-eyed boy to illicit sympathy from the audience. These tactics aren't very different from the emotional games played in most lame American films.The \"crusty single person with a hidden heart of gold\" meeting and ultimately caring for the \"scruffy, pouty and spunky kid from the street\" is a very tired story, and beyond the early scenes of the horror these children are faced with, the movie brought nothing new to an over-done plot.",

Utilizing elements of the road film, we see the gritty city of Rio De Janeiro, with its decadent, violent, miserable every man for himself society compared to the exploration of a different part of the country, the underdeveloped but vast and beautiful landscape of a more rural Brazil. The protagonists, Dora and Josue, embark on a journey of self-discovery while searching for Josue's estranged father. Throughout the film each hardship the protagonists experience molds them into a more compassionate and empathetic human being.",

The spinster is embittered due to her past, the boy is very mouthy due to never having had a father figure in life: neither of both characters loses their quirks throughout the film, although gradually gaining sympathy for each other over time.\n\nThe movie gives off a rather artistic vibe, a style to which the story lends itself more than to any other. Mind my words though: \"artistic\" and \"phenomenal\" aren't synonymous, as this movie contains a handful of flaws, most noticeably in its frame composition. Individually, the cinematography in each shot is appreciable (apart from the scene where the protagonist's mother is killed, which I found to be portrayed VERY amateurishly); sadly, there oftentimes is little cinematographic coherence between different camera angles or scenes, which really takes away from the overall experience. What's more, is that the final quarter of the film seems like it was directed by a wholly different person than the previous three were.\n\nI'd recommend watching this movie because of its story and the uniqueness thereof, albeit pretty appalling concerning cinematography at times.",

One day she witnesses the death of one of her customers and notices her 9 year old son, Josu\u00e9 (Vinicius de Oliveira), has been left alone with no obvious family. Dora is a tough, no nonsense woman and consequently shows Josu\u00e9 no sympathy for his situation, being more concerned distancing herself from anything that tries to penetrate her world. He tries to get her to write a letter to his father, however Dora refuses unless he pays her. The two do end up forming a strained and, at times, volatile relationship, eventually, when Dora feels almost forced into helping Josu\u00e9 after she constantly finds him sleeping rough around the station, where she works. \r\n\r\nIf a road-movie could ever be labelled as \"Epic\", then surely Central Station deserves that very accolade. It's structured almost to perfection, drawing you in through an ever evolving and dramatic storyline. Director Walter Salles, moves the film along a natural and heartwarming path, avoiding the obvious syrupy and sentimental plot traps, which makes the film pleasantly unpredictable and engaging.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest films of the last 20 years.",

            "content": "Ah the Academy. They've made lots of mistakes, everybody knows it. One mistake that gets particular scorn was in 1999, when \"Shakespeare In Love\" beat \"Saving Private Ryan\" for Best Picture. As time as passed, I've realised that \"The Thin Red Line\" is superior to both (Not everyone would agree with that, but at least nearly everyone believes Shakespeare In Love was an undeserving winner). And yet, nobody mentions the other glaring mistakes that year: Ed Norton losing Best Actor, Spielberg receiving yet another Oscar for a rather overrated war film, \"Armageddon\" getting a nomination in any category. Allow me to add another mistake that year: The morally dodgy \"La Vite e Bella\" winning \"Best Foreign Language Film\" among other Oscars (Including Best Actor). I admit that it is a charming film for the first half, but attempting to recreate that charm in the second half inside a Concentration Camp, seemingly betrays the memory of all the people who lost their lives at a time that really should not be used as a backdrop for a comedy routine. So what should have won? Well I haven't seen the other nominees, but they'll have to be pretty damn amazing to top \"Central Station\".\n\nIt seems like a pretty normal road movie: A young boy's mother dies, and he's never met his father. An elderly and lonely woman takes pity on the boy and the two go looking for his father. It could easily turn into sentimental dross with the two slowly developing a love for each other that shines through with everyone shitting rainbows. Fernanda Montenegro (In an Oscar Nominated performance) doesn't let an ounce of sentimentality take over her character, Dora is quite a selfish, morally bankrupt bitch in all honesty: She writes letters and sends them off for people who can't write, yet in her spare time she opens and reads them, judging the people who poured their hearts out to her. There is a battle raging throughout the film: Faith and money, and this battle also takes place inside the soul of Dora. As far as I know, Religion plays an important part in Brazilian culture, but as the country develops, money is becoming more and more important to survive, and the country is becoming a dog-eat-dog world (A really great example of this is early on, when a number of people climb through the windows of a train to grab early seats before the doors open).\n\nSo what of the boy Josue? The young actor portraying him does a pretty good job for the most part, he puts on a tough front but yearns for the love of his father, even if he doesn't always show it. His faith is tested all the time as his journey for his estranged father is always his priority, even though his relationship with Dora is what we focus on for the majority of the film. As is often said, life is about the journey, not the destination, and this is a moving and touching journey where the two don't always get along, cliched set ups are practically non-existant, so the human relationships feel even more real. It's wonderfully shot, and the direction is impressive without being obtrusive, ditto for the soundtrack. Overall, this is a wonderfully moving film, and proof that flavours-of-the-month can take all the Oscars they want, but true film art will live forever.",

Well it's formulaic as hell which is why I feel generous that it reaps in a whopping seventy percent on my tomatometer. The acting and directing were superb, and at the expense of sounding like a pretentious twat, the movie exuded a kind of warm inspirational glow in the face of all of the misfortunes that the two main protagonists experienced. I felt kind of content seeing vivid camera takes of all of the stray dogs running around rural Brazil all to the beat of some Samba inspired Brazillian pop. \r\n\r\nRemind me to upload the soundtrack to my portable MP3 player.",

The boy dreams of meeting his long lost father, while Dora, with reluctance, helps him to find his father, an thus, embarks on a so-called road trip together. \n\nIt's rare to find a good-written and well-acted Brazilian movie. And here is another gem (if you haven't watched \"City of God\" or \"The Man Who Copied\", you don't know what you are missing). As with what I will say about those movies, I will be repeating the same things about this movie too. Brazilian movies are a different breed. They portray societies' woes vividly. And they portray too, the roses within those thorns. I'm going on and on again....",

While it may have taken flashier, scruffier and more violent efforts to grab the world's attention the birth of a recent generation of talented Latino film makers started here in the 1990s, and this film was what gave the last little push to really start the movement off.\r\nBrazil is perhaps the Southern American equivalent of Bollywood in terms of the amount of films made, with more edgy and darker material than most film industries dared to make, and most movie-going publics found hard to stomach. By the time of the post-modern era, when films were satiring not only their own audiences but their own audience's habits and rituals, there was finally enough freedom to show up real issues without fear of a box-office backlash.\r\n'Central Station' presents the most realistic representation of the Brazillian culture within an ordinary cinematic setting. A world away from the sweltering, swaggering 'Goodfellas'-in-tank-tops of 'City of God', this is a more human and intimate study of a unique culture, one that appears to be even more religiously overt and morally cruel than even the Americans. But to assume that Brazil is full of people who don't care about each other is to be ignorant of both a country and the film's message. The central theme is a need to connect and to communicate, and over the course of the story the main figure of 'Dora' learns to rediscover the necessity of speaking from the heart again.\r\nComing full circle with a little montage of dictation for letters, Dora realises that people do have feelings for each other and do want to be with each other, but it's hard in a country so neglected by its government it barely lifts its head above Third World status. In a society where even writing letters is a laborious chore it's understandable so many lives and hearts are broken because people cannot communicate. The film in itself shows how easily issues can be resolved and mended once the right people meet each other, which perhaps serves as less of a criticism of a mean-spirited people and more an indictment against a totally out-of-touch government.\r\nWe do see a darker side of Brazillian life, namely within the city (Rio being the obvious example.) With a 'police force' shamefully masquerading as a mercenary Gestapo and a seedy underworld of organ trafficking aimed at homeless children, this is a society eating itself alive, giving itself cancer from within; yet another reason to understand why Brazillians can afford themselves little consideration for strangers, such is the danger that is hidden beneath the sundrenched streets.\r\nBut mostly the film is about the triumph of good in a desperate situation, wholly inhabited by two fantastic performances. Vincius de Oliveira's 'Josue' is a heart-breaking role, one of cocky boasts and little innocence, yet with an unimistakble naivety and rawness of emotion. Fernanda Montenegro's 'Dora' is a bitter old crone whose own heart has aged even more than her body, but still retains a pain that somehow connects with Josue's. You'll rarely find an odder couple, but together they have their moments of bonding and love, albiet grudgingly, and with never the pride to admit it. \r\nWith some sumptuous cinematography creating a sleepy, musky atmosphere and a haunting, mellow score, it's a wonderful piece of cinema, a beautiful, extraordinary tale of desire and the need to belong, and the true nature of friendship. It's a shame it never won the big awards it was nominated for, going instead to the more controversial and sentimental 'Life is Beautiful'; 'Central Station' however has enough Latino sarcasm and earthy wit not to wear its heart on its sleeve, but conceal it through dozens of layers of pain, frustration and disappointment. And in that way the film is more than a little frighteningly human.",

It also was kind of a Brazilian travel movie.(Be sure and watch it also!@! ) Central Station is a touching story well done. See part of authentic Brazilian life. Its the story of two people connecting through tragic circumstances. Both their lives are changed. The story spirals downward with bad and worse things happening to the two. How in the end all is saved. A classic case of redemption. The films neo-realism makes interesting fare on their long journey from Rio to the north hinter lands of Brazil. All shot on location a very realistic look at Brazil though the story line is slightly to melodramatic for my taste. The film won me over I am a sucker for Brazilian films. I lived in Bahia Brazil for 8 months in 1975! Como Vai Voce? highest rating Dont miss this one. Five Stars!",

The setting of the plot stimulates the curiosity. The story does not end at they happily living together, but let them seperated. After all, no matter how one longs for the accompany of the other, the virtue of this friendship lies exactly in shining of two hearts in a temporary journey. We are sad but not sentimental; indeed there's more hopeful. And that's the power making this movie so great. The music score is simply beatiful.",

Nominated for awards including two Oscars and a golden globe, this film clearly deserves some recognition and attention.\r\n\r\nDora(Fernanda Montenegro) is a cynical letter writer, who charges for her services to the illiterate in Rio's central train station. When a kid's mother is knocked down and killed, moments after she hired Dora to write a letter, a bond between Dora and the Orphan Josue(Vinicius De Oliveira) forms which leads them to look for his father.\r\n\r\nPerformances here are highly solid all round, with most of the film featuring only the two central characters, their acting can easily hold attention and screen time with a great quality. The characters themselves are highly three dimensional and well conceived, and go through some impressive development which is all justified within the movie.\r\n\r\nThe direction shows how a camera can be used simply to achieve something great. Simplistic tracking shots or stationary camera shots are used mostly, taking careful note of framing and the elements within the shot, rather than the motion of it. The shooting on location makes for realistic viewing which enhances the overall story.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the film, there is a definitive emptiness in relation to the whole film. Some moments of the movie are too slow and fail to reach the quality they could, however there is a strong opening and an amazingly moving and touching ending, which is well worth watching.\r\n\r\nCentral Do Brasil is a well written, superbly performed and masterfully shot piece of cinema. Whilst there are a few scenes that fail to impress, the film on the whole is beautiful and exceptionally powerful, deeply moving the audience. Wonderful stuff!",
