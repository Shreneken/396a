            "review_title": "An oft-misunderstood film about quiet desperation",
            "content": "I wasn't going to write a comment for this one, but after reading all the nasty things said about it, and considering that _Happiness_ was the basis for one of my final undergraduate philosophy papers, I feel a duty to defend it.First of all, what you've heard is true: this movie is very graphic and almost impossible to sit through without covering your eyes at least once. However, it is worth noting that the most uncomfortable scenes are uncomfortable precisely because of an empathy that the audience establishes with the characters; it is that precisely that empathy which often pulls the audience in a direction opposite from social mores that makes us squirm.  I don't know how many of the other critics here are schooled in film theory, but that kind of powerful emotional effect is typically considered a GOOD THING in films.  So, really, what most people object to about this film is the content, regardless of what they want other to believe.That said, this really is a wonderful film precisely because of the level of human understanding, empathy, and reality it encompasses.  It portrays human nature from the inside out, where it is least dignified and most pathetic. What we see are a number of people desperately scrabbling around for fulfillment, because they have all to some degree achieved the fulfillment of their desires and found it hollow.  Since they don't realize this fact themselves (most people don't), they look for that fulfillment they feel entitled to by using other people.  It is this fundamental destructiveness of human desire (written about masterfully by Zizek) which causes the \"evils\" in this film.I put \"evils\" in quotes because, as Solondz's film masterfully demonstrates, there is no evil to be found in this film; there is only humanity and suffering.  This absence of moral judgment, though disquieting, is what allows the spectacular sense of empathy and full moral complexity of this film.Thus, the moral of the film is that the surest way of destroying happiness is to seek it.  And that, I feel, is a message that not only makes this a great film but also an artwork of tremendous social value.",

            "review_title": "Well drawn and depressing \u0096 a difficult watch but a worthwhile one",
            "content": "Centred around a New Jersey based family of three sisters, their parents and their partners and acquaintances, this film looks at their lives.  Involving a lonely sister, a sister with a good family life, a paedophile, a telephone sex pest and an elderly couple breaking up, the film follows their short stories through whatever it takes them.I remember hearing this film reviewed as being pretty good, but it was pointed out by the critic that it was far from a movie to take a first date to!  Seeing it now for the first time he was very right, in fact I would say it is the type of film that could make a partner worry about you if you suggest you watch it together.  What type of audience this was made for is questionable but it is not without merit even if it is very, very bleak. The actual `plot' is no more than a collection of stories that roughly overlap due to the character's relationships to one another.  Most of these work well enough and are interesting, but the odd one falls slightly flat \u0096 Allen's overweight flatmate goes a little too far and the Russian thief subplot is not really engaging.However for most of the film the stories are very engrossing despite being very sad.  The plot assumes unhappiness of one form or another to be a given as part of life, and I think that that is a pretty fair assumption.  Some of the characters bring it on themselves, some of them are simply alone however all the scope of human misery is here even if it takes the form of events that not everyone will be able to relate to.  No matter whether or not you like the characters you will feel for them \u0096 they are very well written and the dialogue feels natural.  While the paedophile character will turn many stomachs, I did respect the film for not monsterising him.Baker plays him very well, and mixes it with all the hallmarks of a `normal' guy.  His chats with his son form a strand that runs through the film well and is ultimately quite moving and hard to watch.  Hoffman and Boyle don't really have a great deal to do and their characters were harder for me to buy into, as their relationship was not clear.  All the cast do a good job regardless mainly because the characters are very well written and fit together in a great ensemble presentation.  Special mention should go to Lovitz for a great little cameo that opens the film \u0096 in 4 minutes he gives a better performance than I have seen him give anywhere else.Overall this film is not an easy, fun film to watch but it is very well written even if some of the threads do not engage as much as the others. The conclusion of the film offers no respite and only sees a collection of characters hurt by themselves or others who have little hope for the future other than to just keep plodding on.  Like it or not the message of the film is powerful even if the presentation doesn't do anything to make it accessible.  When REM close the credits singing `happiness where are you? I've searched so long for you' it is difficult not to feel something.",

            "review_title": "Polarizing",
            "content": "There are only a handful of films that have a distinct polarizing affect on the audience--A Clockwork Orange, The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover, and I would even lump in American Beauty--these are movies you either get, or you don't. And if you don't get it, you will hate it. Open minded viewers need only apply, and that's certainly the case with \"Happiness.\" I remember leaving the theater absolutely shocked, and not just because of the events on screen. I was shocked that I found the movie so intelligent and oddly entertaining. The actors surely must have felt that, after reading the screenplay. And there are some big actors in this--veterans like Ben Gazzara, Louise Lasser, Elizabeth Ashley, mixing with new talent like Philip Seymour Hoffman, Camryn Manheim, Dylan Baker, Lara Flynn Boyle, etc. The subject matter is truly unsettling--a parental figure, respected in his community, does some horrible things, and this is the main reason why so many people have a hard time with this movie. Did this material really need to be examined in modern cinema? Well, yes--in the same way that David Lynch had to explore it in Blue Velvet. Happiness is a masterpiece of irony (even in the title), and finds humor in the most unusual and downright bizarre circumstances. You will not see another movie like it. Guaranteed. And fair warning--you could very well despise it. And it's probably a fair estimate that its writer/director, Todd Solondz, doesn't give a damn.",

            "review_title": "One of the year's best films--but be prepared for some very disturbing material. **** (out of four)",
            "content": "HAPPINESS / (1998) **** (out of four)\nTodd Solondz, writer and director of \"Happiness,\" describes his perplexing film as \"a series of intertwining love stories, stories of connections missed and made between people, how people always struggle to make a connection, and to what degree they succeed or don't.\" It's about relationships, obsessions, and stunning discoveries both private and social. It contains some very graphic material-enough that the filmmakers released it without an MPAA rating. Even as the film exploits extreme adult themes and graphic content, it does not glamorize or stylize its subjects. Rather, it uses them to paint a disturbing picture of the dark side of human nature.\nThe film connects with the audience because these characters feel real-they are ordinary people with serious problems. It takes place in a homely suburbia environment in which Solondz draws us in, and eventually pushes us far away with enough provocative content to stand next to \"A Clockwork Orange.\" The movie does, however, know what to show on screen and what not to. It's smart, and indecisive, not dirty and gratuitous. The film defines the character's relationships very well. \"Happiness\" doesn't explore random, unrelated characters. Their separate lives do, however, connect, and the movie does a great job revealing those connections.\"Happiness\" follows a complicated story woven through the lives of many characters. Joy Jordan (Jane Adams), a middle-aged telephone sales person living by herself in New Jersey, longs for a decent relationship after recently breaking up with her boyfriend (Jon Lovitz). Her parents, Mona (Louise Lasser), and Lenny (Ben Gazzara), are pending a divorce through their catalyst neighbor (Elizabeth Ashley). Joy has two sisters: Trish (Cynthia Stevenson), and Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle). Helen brags about how many men lust for her, while Trish is a chripy homemaker married to a therapist named Bill (Dylan Baker). Bill appears to be a typical husband and father, but he is really a homosexual pedofile who masturbates over teen idol magazines and molests the friends of his preteen son, Billy (Rufus Reed). Bill, however, has done a good job at hiding his disturbing feelings from his friends and family.Billy confronts his father about his developing sexuality, while Bill is also riddled with sex discussions as one of his patients, Allen (Philip Seymour Hoffman) obsessively raves about having sex with Helen. They meet one day when Allen makes one of his usual obscene phone calls, and Helen enjoys his heavy breathing and wants to make love with Allen. A large woman (Camryn Manheim) who lives in the same apartment complex as Allen often knocks at his door.  She likes Allen, but he is too busy shuffling through porno magazines and making explicit phone calls to random women to notice those feelings.In the production notes, producer Ted Hope describes Todd Solondz's vision as \"comedic tragedy. Todd knows how to maintain that fine balance between heartbreak and humor. You're often unsure whether to laugh or cry.\" The dialogue, always riveting and thought-provoking, sometimes shocking with its irony and explicitness, often perplexes us; we are not quite sure how to respond to such phrases.Take a scene where Bill exchanges a conversation with the coach of his son's baseball team \u0096we're not sure whether to laugh or weep-we feel a little humor and sadness mixed. The coach is concerned of his own son's sexual status-he is afraid his kid is homosexual. Here's what their conversation involves:Coach: What do you think would happen if I got him a professional... you know... Bill: A professional? Coach: Hooker. You know, the kind that can teach things... first-timers, you know... break him in. Bill: But Joe, he's 11. Coach: You're right, you're right. It's too late.Ironic how I screened Neil Lebute's sexually provocative \"Your Friends & Neighbors,\" just days after this astonishing production. Both movies honestly examine deep human despair in disturbing, frank detail. I remember the dialogue in both films. A specific scene in \"Happiness\" where Billy asks his father some very difficult questions about molestation. His father answers his son honestly, no matter how difficult the questions got.I compare that scene to the scene in \"Your Friend's & Neighbors\" where three men relax in a steam room, and the character played by Jason Patrick verbally remembers his best sexual experience. These sequences require numerous viewing. They stare into the deep, dark crevices of the heart, and we can only watch in bafflement at the thought-provoking power these movies have and how they challenge our perspectives. \"Happiness\" is one of the better films of the year.",

            "review_title": "Solondz is one of the best American directors working today. Period.",
            "content": "I don't want to waste time analyzing the plot since others have covered it so well... Basically here we have a Robert Altman-esqe pastiche of characters stemming from a seemingly normal family, plus others who come into their lives. Solondz sets them up and examines their lives, their dreams, their interactions and their facades. What's important is that he doesn't JUDGE these people. And even more importantly, he doesn't condescend to his audience. Like it or not, the people in this movie do exist and I think viewers instantly realize that.This movie stirs up such strange emotions. It's tough to admit that we may have something in common with a Suburban pedophile, a pathetic dreamer, a pretentious literary snob or a obscene telephone sex stalker and one of the most frightening ideas ever put on film is here: Solondz makes plausible the people we view as being \"sick\" or generally look down upon aren't that much different than us. They still want the same things we do. And he also questions the ideals America seems to hold most dear, like monogamy and morality. And yeah, happiness. How exactly DO you find happiness? Is ANYONE really happy?I cannot recommend HAPPINESS enough (neither can I with the director's equally impressive and incisive WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE). It's just an extraordinary movie; surprisingly funny, intelligent, brutally honest, powerful, original and relevant. The cast is thoroughly excellent and Solondz follows his own compass at all times in both the scripting and directing department. He's a brave filmmaker and I really have a lot of admiration for directors and writers who stray away from the tired Hollywood blockbuster formula. Good for some popcorn, sure, but aren't you glad there's other stuff out there to choose from?Reading some of the other reviews posted here I was surprised at the amount of negative comments. I guess this isn't for everyone out there. If you want a fun night of fantasy escapism or a brainless comedy, don't bother. But if you want a blisteringly funny dose of reality, then don't miss this! Definitely a top contender for My 10 Favorite Movies of the 1990s list.",

            "review_title": "Dark brilliance",
            "content": "When a film opens with a scene between two people, one breaking up with the other, culminating in the dumped calling the dumper \"Shit\", you know you're in for something dark with this film. When the scene is followed by the simple opening title \"Happiness\" written in pretty cursive writing, you know it's going to be ironic as well. \"Happiness\" was written and directed by Todd Solondz, the mind behind the film \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\", a film that was fantastic but really hard to watch if the viewer has any kind of heart. \"Happiness\" follows in the same vein, though this time, instead of centering around one character, Solondz puts a New Jersey family at the center of the film and develops new characters through their relationship with the family.Overseeing the family is Mona Jordan (Lasser), the matriarch of the family who has just been told by her husband that he no longer loves her. Lenny Jordan (Gazzara) is simply sick of being tied to someone continuously, while insisting that there is \"no one else\". Joy Jordan (Adams) is a serially employed thirty-something single female who is constantly belittled by her family and ignored by society. She is most close to her sister Trish Maplewood (Stevenson), a stay at home mother with three kids who likes to say she \"has it all\". Her husband Bill (Baker) is a psychiatrist who outwardly appears to be a stoic family man, but is actually a pedophile who, within five minutes of the introduction of his character, goes to a convenience store to pick up a teen heartthrob magazine so he can masturbate in the back seat of his car to the pictures of the young boys on the cover. The third sister in the family is Helen Jordan (Boyle), an author recently made semi-famous for an angst-ridden published diary (filled with lies) who has a very high opinion of herself and a way of making others feel badly about themselves while never raising her smooth-as-glass voice or making her jabs obvious. Her neighbor Allen (Hoffman) is in love with her, only he is so inept at socialization and unable to approach her that he attempts to satisfy his desires by first making random obscene phone calls to various women, and then making Helen a target herself. Another neighbor, Kristina (Manheim) is an insecure, quiet woman who is constantly trying to befriend Allen, possibly as a love interest.There is quite a cast of characters to this ensemble picture, and the story lines become intricate and increasingly more complicated as the film progresses. \"Happiness\" is filled with excellent character actors (at the top of the list would certainly be Hoffman) but the most compelling character and character portrayal would be Baker's character of Bill Maplewood. Obviously, a film that deals unflinchingly with pedophilia and child rape, particularly under the guise of a \"dark comedy\" is going to be held under closer observation, but even under this scrutiny, Baker's portrayal is absolutely flawless. While his character is a monster, Baker is able to provide a human side to it, where I was left thinking he was a terrible man, but also had sympathy for him because he had a sickness. There are not many actors I can think of that could pull off this role as stupendously as Baker did. Baker was the clear star of the film in my opinion, but the performances of every person in the cast were fantastic as well, particularly the young boy who played Baker's oldest son.As I stated earlier, \"Happiness\" is rife with irony because on the surface, everyone is miserable. However, it soon becomes relatively clear that this is just how these people are, and each of them to some extent ARE living in happiness, as misguided as it may appear to be. Everyone ends up being hurt or disappointed on some level, but they are still together and seem to be satisfied to be in the destructively emotional rut they are in. Solondz, who really has his finger on the pulse of misery, (Just like when, upon hearing that Stephen King gets inspiration for his books from his dreams I was glad that he at least makes millions from being terrified at night, I would hate to get a front row seat in Solondz's psyche) really gives the audience something to chew with \"Happiness\". I loved the chances he took with the subject matter, I loved the performances, and I loved the film as a whole because it was just so damn well done. It's not an easy film to watch, and it's not an entirely pleasant one to watch at times, but it is truly a piece of genius with the way it is intricately put together; envision trying to glue tiny shards of crystal into place with a tweezers \u0096 the characters in \"Happiness\" are as fragile and ready to shatter at any moment, whether they can see it for themselves or not. 8/10 --Shelly",

It's a rich carousel of scared, scary lives with an inter-connecting pattern: the disillusionment of coupling--and how one keeps trying to succeed in this department despite the humiliations. Pretty funny once you get the idea--and only if you're attuned to this kind of sick black humor. Not for the faint of heart, but extremely clever concoction from talented writer-director Todd Solondz (whose first film, \"Welcome To The Dollhouse\", struck me as a stunt). This one is frank, funny, and very warped--almost over-the-top in places, especially the ending--yet kept on track by the terrific performances. Some might compare this to the later \"Magnolia\" (they're both tapestry films), but \"Happiness\" is superior, and certainly less pretentious. *** from ****",

            "review_title": "\"Happiness\" is where hope goes to die",
            "content": "To call Todd Solondz's \"Happiness\" a dark comedy is to redefine the words \"dark\" and \"comedy\". It hates the world and everyone in it, and takes great pleasure in mocking people stupid enough to try to be happy. In Solondz's world, life is pointless, hope is for suckers, and everybody is basically bad at heart. It says something that the movie's most human, sympathetic character is a child molester.And, yes, it's a comedy - often a very, very funny one. Funny in a morbid, gallows humor, dead baby joke sort of way, but funny nonetheless.The chief characters in \"Happiness\" are all stunted, narcissistic and hopelessly inadequate. Joy (Jane Adams) is a born loser who drifts through a series of menial jobs and drives her boyfriend to suicide; her sister Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle) is so self-absorbed that she thinks her biggest problem is that everyone loves her too much; her neighbor Allen (Philip Seymour Hoffman) can only connect to people by making obscene phone calls; and Bill (Dylan Baker), his therapist and Joy and Helen's brother-in-law, is a pedophile who rapes two of his 11-year-old son's friends.Somehow, Solondz makes these horrible people really, really funny. Like John Waters and the Farrelly Brothers, Solondz finds humor in ugliness and revels in bad taste. He makes sexual dysfunction and personal failure brutally funny; Allen's obscene phone calls, for example, are almost endearing in their ineptitude and anatomical incorrectness (\"I'm gonna f*** you in the... ear\"), while Helen's narcissism makes her gloriously clueless (\"If only I had been raped as a child - then I would know authenticity!\"). Solondz shows his characters in a clear, satiric light, and it despises them.While Solondz may not like his characters, he does not take the easy way out by making them caricatures. Every one of these awful human beings is a three-dimensional character with reasons for being awful.For example, most directors would have made Bill a one-note villain, but Solondz makes him a pitiful monster who is tortured by ghastly sexual urges that he knows are wrong. There's a tough scene near the end where Bill has a frank talk with his son Billy about his pedophilia, admitting: that he enjoyed raping his victims; that he would do it again; and, while he would not rape his own son, he would \"jerk off instead\". Both father and son are crying - Billy with horror as he realizes just what Bill is, and Bill with shame and despair as he realizes the same thing. It's hard to watch, but it's an acting master class and absolutely fearless film-making.This is a real actor's movie; the cast gives career-best performances. Baker is both horrifying and heartbreaking as Bill; he squirms in his own skin, as if he is being eaten alive by his own sickness. We pity him, whether we want to or not. Hoffman is hilariously pathetic as Allen, sweating and mumbling with lonely self-hatred. Adams is sad and sweet as the luckless Helen, the closest thing the movie has to a moral center, while Boyle is priceless as the contemptible Helen, swanning around as if waiting for the world to thank her for being born.\"Happiness\" is the epitome of \"acquired taste\" - its humor is bitter, acidic and often cruel, and it takes real joy in offending the audience. Go elsewhere for a feel-good comedy with a happy ending. If nothing else, though, it's a true original, and deserves credit for carving out its own niche in the \"dark comedy\" genre.",

There was a lot to get. Goodness gracious! (As my dear Grandmother might say, who, incidentally, is not a candidate for viewing THIS one!)I'd read the reviews for Happiness in 1998; I'd had a typically positive Psychic Movie Reviewer moment. This indie sounded unique. I waited for Happiness - sniffle - to appear upon my friendly video store shelves, but saw nada. I imagine that the store probably had like two copies maybe, displayed briefly upon a bottom shelf someplace. I forgot about the existence of this film, until recently. And I recently heard that a certain video chain had allegedly pulled Happiness from its shelves due to customer complaints.Disturbing yet intriguing, this film pulled me along, the matrix of character interaction becoming increasingly more intricate and strange. Definitely not for all tastes!The subject of child sexual abuse is handled matter of factly, yet chillingly and effectively. As with the domestic/sexual abuse of women, the problem of child sexual abuse is obviously one that crosses lines of class, social status, and profession. Happiness acknowledges this fact, in the character of family man/psychiatrist Bill Maplewood.Loneliness, rage, sexual repression/obsession, disintegrating marriages, sadly sophisticated children, relationships built upon artifice, this film has it all. It's Prozac Cinema at its best: try to be on an even keel when pressing 'play'.Spouses, parents and children seem to be communicating across a void.After viewing Happiness for the second time, I realized that the entire soundtrack intentionally consisted of melodramatic, and/or ultra perky canned music: a perfectly ironical compliment and contrast in style with the strong, harsh, quirky film scenes.Presentation: director Solondz sets up the viewer for traditional father/son talk scenes, via mood and pseudo canned music: giving the subject matter and dialogue all the more impact. WHAT did he just say? Ward and Beaver Cleaver never behaved this way.Got 134 minutes and a desire to see something darkly different? Rent Happiness. Or buy it.",

            "content": "I'd heard and read the reviews, seen most of the actors in other films, and even though I haven't yet seen WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE, heard a lot of praise for Todd Solondz. Now that I've finally seen this, I can understand what all the hype was about.Many people will not get the point of this film; others still will refuse to, (and do, as I've read in a lot of the comments posted before mine.) Any film created to bring us a little closer to some of life's darker, harsher truths is going to be anything but popular with the majority, and it will always be guaranteed to polarize audiences, no matter how \"open-minded\" they are.HAPPINESS now has caused me to reevaluate my own personal definition of what a \"horror\" film truly is. As a staunch fan of the genre, I have always understood and accepted our need for the Boogeyman in all his guises: Dracula, the Frankenstein monster, Freddy Krueger, the Ghostface Killer from SCREAM, the list goes on. We have always needed greater horrors that stir something in our psyches, to help us deal with the more real horrors that can be found in everyday life, down the street, on the front page of today's paper, or even in the house/apartment next-door.That's what makes HAPPINESS a true horror film, closer actually to the Dutch thriller THE VANISHING than it is to AMERICAN BEAUTY. Even in its extreme over-the-top depictions of its pathetic character's scabrous existences, we are made uncomfortable by the one universal fact that will continue to cause Solondz to be called both a prince and a pariah: we all have something to hide.In the quest for what we hope, we desire, we NEED to experience as happiness, we are sometimes prepared to say and do things we'd rather not talk about and we definitely wouldn't confess to anybody else. Whether or not we lose sight of the difference between right and wrong, good and evil in that quest depends on who we are, and how well we deal with the truths that come back to haunt us when we're lying awake at three in the morning...But enough about the film's effect on me, personally. The cast delivers some of the most mind-boggling work of their careers, and in the case of Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Dylan Baker, both Golden Globe nominees for their performances here, one worries about the future of their careers, and whether they'll be hobbled by typecasting as mouth-breathing losers or fatherly pedophiles, so remarkably realistic are the portrayals.\nWould I recommend repeated viewings? As a precursor to suicide, possibly. Would I recommend that it be seen at least once? Absolutely. If you want a reminder of what real horror is all about, you don't have to look at Bosnia, or Palestine, or Belfast, or even Columbine. If you could lift up just one corner of the sunny street where you live and see what the neighbors are hiding underneath the well-kept, manicured, white-washed veneer of their satisfied suburban lives, that one glimpse might start you screaming, and you'd never be able to stop.Or maybe the darker truth is even closer than that...maybe it's right in your own backyard. And that's what HAPPINESS is trying to say. When you pass judgment on people in real life who are a lot like some of the characters here, is it really because of what you see in them? Or is it something you see in the mirror, that you'd rather not?With BLUE VELVET, David Lynch showed us the scars underneath the smiling face of Small Town, U.S.A. With HAPPINESS, Todd Solondz puts those same scars underneath the lens of a microscope, and invites us to take a good, long look...",

And I'm glad, because if this material had been attempted by anyone without extreme skill and sensitivity, it would have been a monstrous disaster. As it is, I don't think I would add it to my DVD collection. I don't know if I could watch it again, and I'm not sure I'd feel comfortable people seeing it on my shelf unless they knew me well. There are moments of great hope in this movie, when you think misery may finally give way to happiness. There are moments of great honesty, when a character says just what you'd expect them to say, and you realize how \"safe\" every other movie character has been in comparison. The humor that other reviews talk about is not the kind of humor that makes me laugh, personally. It's the dark, visceral humor of human weakness, meanness and even pathology. I still appreciate it for what it is, and it is used in a profound and delicate way. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is willing to accept that life, and especially sexual life, is really much more complex and difficult than we usually admit. I recommend watching it alone, or with a friend or partner with whom you can discuss the most emotionally difficult topics. This movie will test you if you stick with it, but you'll know you saw something profound.",

I've seen Happiness at least 5 times, and with each viewing I pick up on things I'd never noticed before. The attention to detail is jaw-dropping; every single plot element has purpose, as does every line of dialogue.

A really, really dark comedy-but still a comedy.The dialogue is absolutely magnificent. As I said, this is a truly dark comedy, so there's plenty of really, really messed up and disgusting lines of dialogue throughout this film that made me howl with laughter, and some are even hidden in really depressing sequences. Solondz's film manages to be an emotional roller coaster, filled with sequences that are simultaneously funny and cold, and it all somehow manages to work.Performances are also pretty great. Each of the actors really becomes their character and reflect the deep sadness in this film. As one can easily tell, most of the characters in this film are severely lacking in any happiness whatsoever (making the title really ironic), and this film is their journey to find true happiness-and a lot of them, sadly, don't.The film is really spectacular in every sense of the word.

Forget the \"dark comedy\" label - I found almost nothing even remotely funny in the movie and in fact the overall effect was completely depressing. Happiness is an interesting movie but it wasn't funny or entertaining in the traditional sense of the word and it's nothing I'd ever want to see again.At times, the film felt like a hollow exercise in wallowing in the misery of the characters; I imagined the main protagonists as ants and the writer/director sitting there with a magnifying glass, making them burn. Their humiliations are sometimes played for laughs in ways that didn't always work. Jon Lubitz's bitter opening monologue after he's dumped - hilariously awkward. Faux happy music playing when another character is on his way to raping a pre-teen? Err, no. The material is too serious to treat in such a cavalier way. Really, Happiness reminded me of The Ice Storm, except that movie addressed similar themes in an intelligent way with real characters and asked us to take the situation seriously. The Ice Storm also offered a glimmer of redemption, which struck me as far truer to life than the empty nihilism on display here.Happiness wants to rub our nose in the sordid details - was there any reason to show two separate scenes of dripping cum? - but doesn't really have much to say. The film is very well-acted and it's certainly interesting so it's worth watching. I just think a movie this deliberately offputting needs to have a stronger message than \"We're all an F'ing mess.\"",

But there's a curious sense of sadness and emptiness at the core of many of the morally reprehensible things on display that, through the film's keen mix of composition, production design and performances, inexplicably draws you in. You start to question how you can 'feel' for the depraved.\"Happiness\" never excuses nor exploits these actions but it harnesses a poignant undercurrent that's both dark and bewildering. It's a challenging experiment that works because of its willingness to invite you into the psyche and lives of these strange people without trying to judge; It shows the strange impulses that drive us without giving any answers.

            "content": "Brought to you by the same hubris as \"American Beauty\" but with nowhere near the execution, \"Happiness\" attempts to disturb and disgust in the finest Pink Flamingoes tradition, with none of that film's weak wit. \n** MANY SPOILERS AHEAD **If you were to put together a wish list of everything you could want in a film, would it include:* Two cum shots, including one from an 11-year-old boy? * Said young boy crying because his father WON'T rape him? * Repeated scenes of a disturbed obscene caller who has no redeeming qualities whatsoever? * High-quality actors embarassing themselves? * Really bad Russian accents?  (That's always a plus for me!)If all of the above are your idea of brilliance in film, then by all means, \"Happiness\" is for you.  Apparently, this is Solondz's paean to Suburbia, where all denizens are thoroughly depraved.  You can tell because they act normal!  The most 'normal' one of all is Dylan Baker, who is so normal in this film that he's catatonic.  No, just kidding, he only ACTS that way so he can get into little boys' pants!  You know how you can tell he's a bad guy?  He's the only one who's married with two young children, that's how. That's Hollywood's clue to fiendishness and deception.  You see, every married man is really either a beer-drinking abuser or a tight-assed pedophile.  The two fathers of young children in this movie split that right down the middle, with the father of the victim screaming at his son while the police are trying to interrogate him.  You can tell he's the abuser because he shaves his head and wears his flannel shirt unbuttoned and untucked.Don't even get me started on the sisters of the pedophile's wife, and the truly bizarre subplot involving Philip Seymour Hoffman, who should know better, and Camryn Manheim, who sets back plus-size women about 50 years in this role.  Suffice it to say that all three women usually do outstanding work but go through this picture like deers caught in headlights.  Instead of actually delving into the unbelievable terror and anger that must come with finding out your spouse is a serial rapist, Solondz simply skips over that and puts up a \"six months later\" gel.  Sellout!The final scene (which involves the 11-year-old boy masturbating on a balcony) is so stilted and surrealistic you get the idea that Jennifer Lynch wrote it on a break from \"Boxing Helena\".  Three grown women sit around a table asking a fourth when she'll set them up with someone for them, as if they were all twelve years old -- and this includes the women's mother.  She even promises to find someone for her father, but this is all forgotten when the boy walks into the breakfast and announces his first success as a sex offender ... just after the film's aforementioned Pink Flamingoes moment.Oh, yes.  Boy, how could I not miss the BRILLIANCE of this flick?  Give me a break.  Solondz makes a perfect case for diagnosis for arrested development. You get nothing akin to human interaction; everyone in this film seems like they heard about humans from watching a John Waters film.  As drama it's laughable, and as comedy it's anything but.",

            "content": "*SPOILERS*Obviously, 'Happiness' is meant to be provocative, just as all this director's films are, desperately hoping that shock value will carry a film, or at least generate a buzz. Unfortunately, there's really nothing shocking about 'Happiness'. The most taboo of subjects it covers, pedophilia, has already been dealt with in other films much more artistically and thoughtfully (Consider 'Lolita'). Just because something's disturbing, doesn't mean it's art, and certainly doesn't mean it's intellectual.Even the most enthusiastic proponents of this film recognize that without some sort of interpretation, the film is a catalog of perversion and deliberately disturbing images/innuendo. But the enthusiasts of 'Happiness' argue that there's something more to the movie, that there is something funny, ironic, 'human' or artful about the movie. These enthusiasts of Happiness are quick to dismiss criticisms of the film as 'close-mindedness' or simply 'not-getting-it'. But, upon a closer examination, it's easy enough to see that the praises heaped upon this movie are done so out of intellectual weakness.'Funny' is always subjective, and one can't really argue something isn't funny to someone else. Making fun of mentally retarded kids is funny to some people, but it's also cruel and shows a lack of compassion for others. In order for 'Happiness' to be see as funny, it's pretty much necessary to disregard any sympathy for the humanity of the characters in the film. Which, in turn, suggests that if you find the movie funny, then you didn't actually 'get' that the characters were people desperate for some sort of Happiness, rather than ridicule or disdain. Conversely, if you find the characters very human and are sympathetic towards them, then you'd be inclined to feel just as much sympathy towards their victims. The main characters in Happiness act without regard for the consequences their actions might have on others. This makes them sociopaths. They seek their own sexual gratifications at the expense of other's well being. In fact, once the object of obsession for one character makes herself available for whatever horrible thing he wants to do to her, he no longer wishes to do so--- because she's consenting. The point here is, by claiming this movie is funny or 'human', you're either laughing with sociopaths or disregarding some people's humanity in favor of the desires of portrayed sociopaths. Either way, it's finding amusement in the rape of a child, and trying to justify it behind 'art'.Some people have claimed Happiness is about irony. This just shows that, quite ironically, they don't understand irony. Whether you use a prescriptivist or descriptivist definition of it, Happiness isn't 'ironic'. The more applicable term would be 'incongruous', often confused with 'ironic'. For example, an optometrist with bad vision is not ironic, it's incongruous. It WOULD be ironic if he went blind from accidentally jabbing out his eyeballs with his eyeglasses. But there's only incongruity in Happiness, at least from what I remember of it, not irony.So, if Happiness isn't ironic, comedic, or something that displays humanity (as in SYMPATHY for people)--- then the only way to defend it against the criticisms of it's detractors is to say 'it's art'. If you want to call anything produced on artistic mediums art, then by all means, Happiness is art. It's certainly a film, with actors, a plot, and even a soundtrack. But just because something is 'art' doesn't mean it's any good. There is bad art. We call things 'good art' when they present something we find aesthetically pleasing, intellectually stimulating, or they capture the essence of a moment with precision. From an aesthetic standpoint, Happiness is mediocre, simple camera panning and centered frames. One can argue that the film captures the essence of the moment, but unless you've been in that moment, then it's not really something you'll ever be sure of, and frankly, I wouldn't want to be in any of the moments in this film. You can argue that art is meant to show us things that we didn't already know, to allow us to feel emotions which we normally don't--- at which point, one is forced to wonder why anyone would desire to experience the awful situations the characters are put into. It's masochism, and a sterile, voyeuristic masochism at that.The last argument I can imagine to justify watching this film is that it's intellectually stimulating. But how? Yes, perverts and pedophiles are people too. That's never been a matter of debate. It is precisely because they ARE people that we condemn their actions and the hurt they cause others. The only question left is 'Should they be punished?'--- and, well...Yes. Rapists certainly deserve punishment regardless of whether they deserve sympathy.Finally, there are some who actually claim that this movie is worthwhile because it doesn't present a moral judgment. But if we didn't already have moral judgments, right or wrong, on sexual perversion, then we wouldn't be able to recognize any of the 'conflict' in the film. The whole movie revolves around individuals who are tortured by the RECOGNITION that what they desire is morally wrong. This is why they hide their longings from 'society'. Without the recognition of their perversions being morally wrong, there's no inner conflict, simply a litany of perversions happening. The problem with 'Happiness' is that the characters, realizing their desires are considered amoral by their society, try to satiate their desires and remain part of a society which condemns their actions, rather than fully embracing their desires by finding a different society, or fully embracing society by refraining from their actions. Their flaws are not sexual deviancy, just stupidity and selfishness, for which we are to feel sympathy? Why would anyone think Happiness was a good movie? I can only conclude that they didn't get it, felt confused and decided it was thus 'deep'. What a self-righteous waste of film.",

The mechanics of the movie (photography, writing skill, editing, etc.) may be adequate, but the tone and the \"feel\" of the thing is dreadful. As an American, I strongly support the First Amendment-- and I say these film folks certainly have the right to make this, or any, kind of movie. Great. The public has the right to see it, and buy it. I'm totally supportive of that. But I just wish I had been more fully informed, so I could have made a more intelligent and appropriate decision for myself. As it is, this \"movie\" has left a greasy spot in my brain where it had lain; I now have hellish images of depravity stuck in my mind. I feel scarred, and emotionally or psychically injured, somehow. And being unwarned as I was, I feel ambushed, blindsided. If the \"low life\" nightmares depicted in this movie are for you-- fine. Welcome to it. But couldn't someone other than the artsy critics have also commented on it beforehand? Of course-- shame on me. I could have - should have rented a copy first, which would have saved me the price of the DVD. Of course, I still would have seen it, though. Dang-- I trusted those guys!",

            "content": "\"Happiness\" is the tale of three sisters: an actress, a live-with-parents musician and a married woman. Each of them has problem with their love life, some more than others. Also stars Jon Lovitz, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Dylan Baker. (And Ben Gazzara, best known to me as Jackie Treehorn from \"The Big Lebowski\".) The film excels because the stories overlap, yet continue in a linear fashion. This adds to the strength of the themes, being different but still connecting. For example, one sister is married to a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist is the doctor for Hoffman, who makes obscene phone calls to another sister (the actress, Lara Flynn Boyle). The doctor, of course, has no knowledge that this man's fantasy is his sister-in-law.The film is also quite funny, as evidenced by the casting of Lovitz (who opens up the film in a very dry bit of realism) and to a lesser degree Hoffman (who is not always funny, but is known for his quirky supporting roles... like, again, \"The Big Lebowski\"). In other scenes the humor is very dark and will not appeal to most of the people out there. With masturbation, stalking and pedophilia being the running themes you can understand many might be offended.I, for one, appreciate the way the material was handled. It wasn't funny to the point of being a gross-out comedy (like \"Waiting\") or dramatic to the point of being a Lifetime movie. I found the portrayal of pedophilia to be lifelike (as much as I can assume this) and this really drives the film home, emotionally. Criminals and the mentally ill are not \"monsters\" but human beings, and they have families that are hurt by their actions.I would encourage you to see this film. I think the key demographic would be people aged 20-30, possibly more men than women. But if you're open-minded, you will appreciate this film and the message it has. (Also, if you've seen the director's other movie, \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\", you know what to expect.)",

            "content": "This is a subversively dark yet sometimes funny movie that on the surface seems to deal with a bunch of pathetic losers. Those losers however simply turn out to be every day people dealing with their own bouts of loneliness, obsession, and quiet desperation. Though we don't know it at the start, most of the principal characters all belong to a single family, handling their neuroses in the best way they can without making much progress. An odd aspect of the film is that it takes a look at human frailties that lead their characters into various forms of depravity without making a moral judgment, leaving that pretty much up to the viewer. For that reason, there will be those who abhor the picture and those who may take away some meaningful insight. Dylan Baker, as the tortured psychologist Bill Maplewood is a case in point. His portrayal is probably just a bit too candid for most folks, and quite frankly, I didn't see any credibility in his frank discussion about sexual abuse and masturbation with his own son. Maybe I'm na\u00efve, but I'd bet if there were one in a million parents like him discussing such a personally depraved topic while implicating himself in a crime, then I just don't comprehend human nature. Ditto for Kristina (Camryn Manheim) laying bare her slice and dice of Pedro the doorman to neighbor Allen (Philip Seymour Hoffman). On the flip side, Allen's behavior as a serial phone call abuser seemed all too credible and I don't doubt there are any number of perverts like him running around getting their kicks anonymously. The best that can be said about the film is that each of the players effectively demonstrate their own failures as human beings while striving for their own definition of happiness, elusive as that may be. Among the principal cast members, there's really no one who evokes enough sympathy to be considered a good guy or gal, so ultimately, a happy ending is deemed inconclusive. One surprise in the picture though was the appearance of the real estate agent who showed Mona Jordan (Louise Lasser) an apartment. I'd never seen Marla Maples in a picture before, and her identity eluded me until I looked up her credit for the film here. It made me wonder if her ex-husband Donald Trump ever saw this picture.",

Joy, a naive, unsuccessful songwriter, Helen, a self-destructive poet and Trish, a housewife married to a prominent psychologist. I have heard this referred to as Solondz' best, and I agree with that. He once again confronts social problems(and once again focusing on suburbia) including relationship/sexual troubles, and the controversy of this, holding perversion(pedophilia and rape), explicit dialog, disgusting visuals, being nihilistic(there is no good or bad, objectively speaking, it's all subtle shades of grey... with that said, this doesn't glorify the negative stuff that happens), and being ironic in its tone, has left it rather divisive. Is this brilliant or tasteless? ...well, if it can't be both, then every viewer has to decide for themselves. Regardless of if you wind up hating it or not(it is not for everyone, and you aren't \"dumb\" if you don't like it), I would like to remind you that problems that go unexplored remain unsolved. This doesn't claim to know how to better things(and I can understand why some complain about this), and yet this isn't depressing. Honestly, I couldn't take my eyes off it, for the 130 minute running time. Yes, it is raw, the leads go through a ton of cruelty, the ending doesn't follow up on everything... but it is also humane, it has smoothly delivered exposition and development of the entirely psychologically credible and well-rounded characters(granted, most of them are selfish... in fact, perhaps all of them are, really, and we see people won't accept the harsh truth, Todd's complimentary spoilt brat, etc.), so much is said with few words, it is funny at times(some will laugh a lot at it), the acting is excellent and it is realistic. Everyone in this is searching for happiness, and none find it. The pace is gradual, scenes that display awkward situations feel like they take forever, just like in real life. This uses long takes and not that many closeups... it shows what happens more than it enhances it in editing. I recommend this to anyone open to it, and mature enough to deal with it(no one not at least in their teen years). 8/10",

Then second is the hot and sexy author Helen(Lara Flynn Boyle) who just might be in for a strange bedfellow in a guy who's a stalker type showing his love with obscene phone calls(a great and unknown role from the late Philip Seymour Hoffman). Finally number three is Trish(C. Stevenson) the rich housewife with a kid yet she has a secret monster for a husband a messed up shrink(Dylan Baker).

Unlike, say, THE ICE STORM, which is also a study of middle-class behavior but is objective towards its characters, HAPPINESS seems to revel in the cruelty each character suffers.  We get paper-thin characters as well doing crude, rather than shocking things, and then we're supposed to pretend it's satire.  Well, I'm sorry, but that ain't satire.  Also, there are some good actors here(I'm particularly a fan of Jane Adams and Philip Seymour Hoffman), but they all coast on mannerisms here.

            "content": "I've always enjoyed 'Happiness,' despite asking myself WHY I ever bothered to watch it after every single viewing. Yes, the title is deliberately ironic as there is barely a trace of anything vaguely happy in the entire mover, but then it knows that. It's safe to say that 'Happiness' is definitely not a 'feel-good' film and you really do need to know what you're in for before you sit down to invest over two hours with this manic depressive beast of a movie.I suppose you could call it an 'ensemble' piece as there are numerous characters all woven together around the three central characters who are sisters all at various stages of adulthood and doing their best to either live with what's become their lot in life, or desperately try to change it. It's basically a family drama, but with a few \u2013 very \u2013 dark helpings of black humour. However, the overriding thing to say about 'Happiness' is that it deals with the worst themes you can probably think of and presents them in a way that forces you to think about those who it's easy to despise without a second thought. Therefore, you don't just have to be in the mood for something depressing, but also something that really goes into areas of human nature that you would probably not like to dwell on, most notably child abuse.'Happiness' is a film that will certainly leave an impact on you, even if it's just you swearing you will never watch something like that again. However, for all the darkness and realism it presents, I have watched it about three times and I think it's a worthy film. The performances are all excellent. You'd be hard put to it to find a weak link among the cast. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is naturally excellent, but perhaps the hardest role falls to Dylan Baker who plays possibly one of the most (bizarrely!) relatable child molesters you've ever met. It must have been a horrible role for him and he plays it to perfection.Like I say, don't expect feel-good and get ready for a rough ride. But, if you're in the mood for something as deep as this it will certainly make you wonder who's sitting opposite you and what goes on behind the fa\u00e7ade of family-friendly life.",

            "content": "How come that this movie was completely overlooked by most big award ceremonies? Probably because of its controversial subjects. It's brilliantly written and directed and brilliantly acted out by its cast members. It's perhaps the most overlooked movies from the '90's and is on a level of brilliance I haven't seen a movie on for a long time. This is one of those movies that grabs and doesn't let go. It makes you forget the time and everything else that is happening around you. I haven't watched a movie in that way since like forever. It made \"Happiness\" a truly unique viewing experience that left a big impression. The movie kept me thinking for hours afterward and I could hardly sleep because of it.Here they are; characters we often hear and read about in the papers and on TV. Characters we simply think of as being unsympathetic monsters, we don't want to spend too much thoughts about. I'm talking about pedophiles and phone sex masturbaters, among others. This movie shows that in truth often those people are nothing more than common persons, with a good job, money and a family of their own. They could be a colleague of yours, a neighbor or even a family member. A person you think you know but without ever truly knowing what is going on in their heads and what their perverted sexual fantasies and preferences are. The movie shows that these sort of things could happen in your neighborhood or somebody you know. It's shocking and confronting but of course closer to the truth then them just being cold-hearted ruthless monsters, even though the thought of it is strangely more comforting. The fact that it all are 'ordinary' persons is far more shocking. None of the characters wants to be that way, they just ARE that way.\"Happiness\" does a good job at creating a realistic environment and story lines and connecting all those different lines together in the movie. The movie follows multiple different characters and therefor also story lines but the movie never gets disjointed even though of course every storyline has its weaker and less interesting moments. It also doesn't make the movie confusing or unnecessary hard to follow, like some other directors would probably have done with the story (Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu or Steven Soderbergh springs to mind.) The movie instead chooses a light comedy like approach. Comedies really don't get darker than this. Despite its heavy subjects, the movie is also still fun to watch, with some great funny moments. It in a way makes the movie also more accessible to a wider range of audience.The movie is of course also truly uplifted by its fine cast. Even actors who I normally don't really like (like Lara Flynn Boyle) were just great. While watching this movie it made me realize something; Philip Seymour Hoffman is probably my favorite actor at the moment. What can I say, he's just great! I'm glad he finally won an Oscar last year. Finally true recognition for one of the best actors in the business, not just now but of all time. But it in all honesty is Dylan Baker who gives the best performance. He without doubt plays the toughest role of the movie, a married, with children, psychiatrist pedophile. He manages to make the character in a way more accessible and understandable. Especially the sequences with his teenage son, who is starting to discover his own sexuality, are greatly done and very powerful, especially toward the end of the movie. Also Jane Adams delivers a notable performance, as a (too) kind person who gets exploited by others because of it. The pain and inner-conflicts of the characters as portrayed in this movie are almost sensible.If you want to or not, this movie makes you look differently at the world and the sexual 'perverts' we hear and read about. It therefor makes \"Happiness\" a powerful and effective, thought provoking portrayal, of real life humane characters.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

How, in all conscience Solandz thought it appropriate that kids should be put through the excrutiating and emetic scenes they were subjected to is extraordinary. Film makers have their heads so far stuck up their own arses that they would find it inexplicable that any one should question their integrity in the matter. The important thing is bringing their great works to the screen at any cost to the innocent. As long as their parents approve it's all kosher and above board. Deep down though I think a lot of film makers are just sadistic and want to drag us down to wallow in their psychic s**t. Having the dog lick the boy's come and then have the dog lick the mother's mouth is a perfect example. 'Inside The Dollhouse' had a plot credibility problem and likewise here. The confession scene with the father and son was implausible in dialogue and typically repellent.A lot of 'lost' actors turned up to appear in Todd's opus like Louise Lassiter and Ben Gazzara. How refreshing for them to get back to some 'real' cinema again. Cutting edge stuff about the alleged human condition and all that. Gazzara plays a man who feels nothing anymore which doesn't fully explain his odd 'past caring-am I still alive?' performance.

When it comes to comic affirmations, it just doesn't get much more fundamental. Even better, on the way to its climactic climax, \"Happiness\" takes us through an endlessly inventive series of encounters with a large cast of characters, almost all of whom leave an indelible imprint on the imagination and emotions. John Irving, in one of his novels, defines life as an X-Rated soap opera. That's also not a bad description of \"Happiness,\" a taboo-breaking tragicomedy centering on the lives of the three Jordan sisters and their intersecting relationships with parents,  spouses, boyfriends, neighbors, and each other. The pre-opening credit sequence sets the disruptive stage by inserting us into a scene of what appears to be a conventional boy-girl restaurant breakup involving the youngest sister, inaptly named Joy  (played with Buster Keaton- like understatement and wide-eyed innocence by Jane Addams), and the first of three boyfriends who mark the beginning-middle-end of her trajectory in the screenplay. However, this scene, like the movie that follows from it, plays itself out in anything but conventional terms as the boyfriend (Jon Lovitz) retracts a sentimental (if hilariously inappropriate) gift and launches into a withering  speech about which one of them is \"s**t.\" Cut to a title card musically accompanied by a catchy ditty about the elusiveness of happiness. Ah, yes, this is NOT a Julia Roberts - Hugh Grant romantic comedy we have going here. The second of the three Jordan sisters, Trish (Cynthia Stevenson), is an aggressively middleclass suburban housewife who \"has it all,\" including a sympathetic psychologist husband who just happens to be a closet pederast. Even the traumatic outing her husband receives doesn't seem to shake Trish's insufferable optimism or her grip on happiness as defined by consumer mythology.  The third sister, Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle), is a glamorous and in- demand poet who writes about rape, but secretly fears that her shallowness and inauthenticity will be discovered. Out of self-loathing she falls for an obscene telephone caller who tells her she's nothing and that he'd enjoy attempting a copulatory removal of her cerebrum (or words to that effect). Ironically the voice turns out to belong to her nerdy neighbor (the brilliant-as-always Philip Seymour Hoffman) who she has never deigned to even so much as glance at. Other strange characters populating the world of \"Happiness\" include a very obese woman who is raped by an aging Hispanic doorman half her size. With a Rambo neck twist, she kills him in the act and then keeps his body parts in refrigerator baggies. There is also a passionate Russian cabdriver who seduces Joy in order merely to steal her CD player and the guitar she uses to compose the folksong that gives the film its title. The Jordan sisters' parents, Lenny and Mona (Ben Gazarra and Louise Lasser), add still another layer of mawkish comedy as their forty plus year marriage comes apart in an interpersonal dynamic somewhere between Seinfeld's Costanzas and Danny DeVito's Roses. \"Why couldn't you have done this twenty years ago?\" Mona rails, \"Now I'll have to get another facelift!\" While writer/director Ted Solondz (\"Welcome to the Dollhouse\") obviously develops his characters and events in an absurdist style that is always precariously verging on going over-the-top, enough truth and realism are retained to make the viewer cringe in recognition, gasp in discovery, recoil in horror, and laugh in sympathy at the grotesque, yet all-too-human behavior the film depicts. \"Happiness\" is not for all tastes, but it is a marvelous little dark comic gem nonetheless.",

The problem is that their visions could be considered not right. The first sister, Joy Jordan(Jane Adams) is a struggling songwriter who is having a really hard time recovering from a harsh breakup with her mentally unstable ex-boyfriend, Andy Kornbluth(Jon Lovitz).

The third sister, Trish Maplewood(Cynthia Stevenson) is probably the happiest of the three. She has three beautiful children and a loving husband, Bill Maplewood(Dylan Baker). The problem is that little Billy is going through puberty and decides to ask his dad what's going on. His dad is the wrong person to ask because he is a pedophile who regularly rapes and abuses his sons friends. He would never hurt his children, however, because he loves them. To round off the circus of \"freaks\" are the three sister's parents,Mona(Louise Lasser) and Lenny(Ben Gazzara) who are losing control of their marriage. Like Todd Solondz's WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE, his following film is about a person or persons who want things that they can't have. The film has a very real feeling style that may really screw with most viewers of this film. The taboos on obscene phone calls, child molestation, and murder are thrown at the viewers with hard force. Despite being, perhaps, the most disturbing film ever made, the movie has morals. The mess of characters seem appropriate since the subject matter is so extreme. The message on happiness and sex may come at a price of the viewers emotions or their morals. This film will be very difficult to sit through. But as long as the viewers know that this is just a movie, they will have nothing to be scared of. This film, despite making me a little more afraid to have children and making me lose sleep, is very powerful and is the perfect black comedy. The film has different kinds of humor in it, but usually its the kind of humor that you would feel completely evil for laughing at. But this film has a clever and original style with its horrifying characters, its shocking dialog, its utter bleakness, rounding up with one of the most disgusting and heartbreaking endings of movie history.",

            "content": "There aren't a lot of movies that try to seriously portray depression, and even fewer that do so well. Happiness gets so much right it's almost traumatic. I found myself remembering lonely nights in the past, that mixture of hatred and longing for the outside world, the apparent monstrosity of happy people, and the crippling self-doubt that eventually turns you into the awful person you've already convinced yourself you are.If there's one thread tying together this ensemble drama, it's mental illness and dysfunction, and the perils of ignoring it. All of the characters are ultimately incapable of understanding each others emotions, and this blindness has monstrous consequences. Otherwise, Happiness is somewhat disparate, using the loose framing device of an extended family to tie together stories of various subjects and quality. Most interesting to me was Philip Seymour Hoffman as an awkward introvert boiling over with rage that he can never express. Of course, expressing your inner longings is not necessarily a good thing, as with Dylan Baker's pedophile suburban dad. The latter plot often feels overextended, but Baker's oddly sympathetic performance makes it ultimately riveting in a grotesque way. Other plots, such as the jaunts down to a retirement community in Florida, are less interesting, and as the film goes on more and more hacky stereotypes start to creep in, with Gerald Harris's Russian lothario being the biggest example.Todd Solondz presents the whole thing with a sunny TV-sitcom style that underscores both the horror and the ordinariness of what is going on. He also gets some great performances out of his actors, including the expected Hoffman and Baker and the less-expected Camryn Manheim and Jayne Adams. Solondz is a provocateur, sometimes to his detriment, and Happiness is undoubtedly a film that tries to shock and scandalize its audience. But its psychological understanding ultimately makes that shock more than a cheap thrill.",

It is a story about people who long to connect with eachother, but struggle to understand eachother and therefore unfortunately \"are alone together\"... Director Todd Solondz has the unique ability to irritate the movie masses, because he dares hold up a mirror to all the hypocrisy of pretending to be better than you are. Todd Solondz dares to film all those taboos that are NEVER shown in the hollywood movies for the masses. That's why Todd Solondz'movies dont sell very well, but nevertheless are regarded as classics amongst filmcritics and moviegeeks.The movies by Todd Solondz are always about losers, psychiatrically disturbed people, who loathe themselves. And he makes us laugh about those twisted human shortcomings that can ruin relationships and families. In real life those ruined relationships and psychiatric illnesses are not funny at all, but in \"Happiness\" he makes comedy out of misery in a brilliant way. That is to say if you like black comedies, otherwise you will be bored or offended or both. Acting is great. Magnificent performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman. He is just hilarious. The story more or less starts with him being a phone stalker. He is depicted as a truly perverted evil man at the beginning. But as the story progresses more and more \"normal\" people around him, seem to be even more disturbed than he is. In the end the phone stalker is, (relatively speaking), the most sane and innocent of the whole bunch of characters that are seriously mentally ill. It may sound horrible to be able to laugh about so many human shortcomings, but it truly is a \"cheery\" movie. And brilliant, because not many directors can or dare to portray those shorcomings no one dares talk about.Lovely and hilarious soundtrack with a great \"Happiness\" end track by Michael Stipe from R.E.M. which was specifically written for this movie.",

But mix in a layer of imagined (dreamt) and real (we assume) sexual and violent deviance of the worst kind. We don't see the crimes (and they are crimes) but we hear about them, and we see the sadness that ensues.The clash of moods, as people casually deal with heinous acts, is both humorous and sickening (depending on who you are I suppose). It's not a bad angle for a movie. Todd Solondz directs with a very careful and consistent touch, and with some stellar acting by Jane Adams, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jon Lovitz, we end up in some pretty interesting territory.Why does it leave us flat by the end? I'm not sure. Partly pace. Some of the jarring aspects early on become familiar by the end. Partly disbelief. The way we learn of the worst crimes is a little stretched, and though comedies and farces are allowed to stretch things, it comes off stretched thin. At times.

The feeling of overwhelming futility in the dialog is hard to shake, thus making it REALLY hard to give a damn about any of these people (if this was a deliberate tactic, Solondz certainly didn't wield it successfully); the pastel-colored misanthropy and hopelessness that pervades is little more than nihilistic shock for shock's sake. I have no issue with the extremes of human emotion being given an outlet through film, but \"Happiness\" is appalling in its own shrugging passivity. Only one story thread truly inspires awe and disquiet of any lasting merit: the pedophile psychiatrist (brilliantly played by character actor Dylan Baker), who drugs and molests his son's friends during sleepovers--this is the only time \"Happiness\" finds an endearing emotional pulse, perhaps because of the intimacy with which it's handled; the exchanges between Baker and his son are awkward, and, at one point, devastating. Had \"Happiness\" centered on this strong--yet instantly unmarketable--plot, it might have been a truly mature and disturbing production; as it stands, it is backed up with too many worthless characters you could care less about, and dialog that confuses simplism with genius.",

            "content": "A few years back, I lived in a housing project where, one night, my next-door neighbors had a fight.  The police were summoned; and, when my neighbor explained the incident to me, he told me he asked the police this question:  `Do I look like a wife-beater?'  Indeed, What does a `wife-beater' look like?  What does a murderer look like?  Or a pedophile? Or a drug-dealing gangster?  Happiness has been described as a deeply `disturbing' movie, mainly because of its content.  It's about people who do some pretty terrible things.  But I don't think that this adequately describes why it is, at times, difficult to watch.  I think that the alleged problem lies elsewhere:  it does such a great job of unmasking people's self-delusions.  The murderer or pedophile or gangster or wife-beater isn't some unknown, strange person out there: it's your next-door-neighbor, or someone in your family, or you.  It really challenges our notions of normalcy.  Everyone in the movie appears to be `normal.'  And that's why it works so very well.  Solondz does a fabulous job of releasing information about the main characters, a little at a time, until, by the end of the movie, each layer of the onion has been completely removed.  The outer shell looks so happy, so beautiful, while the inner core looks like a substitute for Dante's innermost circle of hell.  The main characters, the entire Jordan family, suffer from an inability to be intimate, which requires vulnerability, honesty, and trust.  They all suffer from this debilitating malaise, because they're all unable to be honest with themselves about their shameful secrets.  And as in real life, the type of people they're attracted to, and attract to themselves, are also deeply disconnected, both from themselves, and from others. \nHappiness isn't an easy movie to watch;  but, it's a film of profound psychological insight and depth.

All of the actors give spectacularly brilliant performances, and not one is mediocre. Jane Adams is sensational in a brave and open performance of which most actresses would have been incapable, and so is the amazing Lara Flynn Boyle (who looks just like my friend Annie Hunt, though not quite so beautiful), who shares the same spellbinding quality as Selma Blair so that you just want to keep staring at her. This film could and should have been a profound and moving film about its ostensible subject, and the director has immense talent which he could have used to achieve that. But instead, he has betrayed his cast and the public by making a film filled with such gratuitously offensive and disgusting material that the film is ruined as a result, and can only be described as utter trash. Let me explain. We see a boy vomit on his breakfast plate, we get to see the vomit of course. We see a man ejaculate his sperm onto a wall, and naturally we get a closeup of it. Then we see an eleven year-old boy ejaculate his sperm onto the railing of a balcony, his dog comes along and licks it up and then goes and licks the mouth of the boy's mother. Then there is the fat lady who killed the doorman. She confesses it merrily, about how she had to cut up his body and put the pieces in her freezer. She says she is disposing of it slowly because such things take time. At least we don't have to see the chopped up body, though we are told about the penis and testicles in a bag. All the characters in the film apart from two little boys who are raped are obsessed by sex like maniacs, including the eleven year-old. His father calmly describes to him how 'great' it was to rape his friends and says he would do it again. Get the picture? Would you say that the director was totally insane? I would. But what about the people who have praised this perverted and horrifying vision of hell? Do you think that they are sane? There have been plenty of crazy directors, and I have even known some (John Huston and Stanley Kubrick for instance), but no matter how disgusting and psychopathologically compulsive-obsessive they may have been in their own ways (Huston was a psychopathic sadist, but otherwise thoroughly charming), they never stooped to anything like this.

Some of the sketches were kinda funny, some were oddly dramatic, but ultimately they didn't seem to go anywhere and it actually felt like the director wanted it that way. Other than perhaps a common tone or style, most of the scenes appear to exist almost in complete separation from the rest of the movie, and hence add little or nothing to it as a whole. More simply put, Happiness is just too long.In terms of entertainment value, Happiness is far too slow paced for me to recommend. In terms of deeper meaning, Happiness seems to be more interested in getting a reaction (possibly negative) out of its audience than being thought provoking or achieving any kind of point. If you want to see a movie that confronts the darker side of human nature (in particular pedophilia) then see Fritz Lang's classic \"M\" instead.

But this film showed me that there's something I hate even more in a film. This film shows the world as something heinous, something perverted, something rotten. It's not depressing per se, except in that it will remove your will to live. Rather it's disgusting.Happiness tells about a group of sisters and the people they interact with in their day to day life. Their families, their relatives, their acquaintances, their neighbours. The film talks about the struggle of upper middle-class, or at least what it perceives to be the struggle of upper middle-class. It positions that these people are without a place, their lives hollow and empty, their purpose non-existent. It positions that to fill this gaping void in their souls, these people turn to perversion. Pretty much every single character in the film is a deviant of some sort. There's masturbation, paedophilia, rape, mutilation of sexual organs and of course dirty phone calls. Everything under the sun.And yet the film is amazingly grey in tone.

Surely there are enough psychopathology courses in American universities to have spread the word by now that such banal treatment of common mental illnesses like those portrayed here is less art than slapstick.It is not enough, I think, to remark -- as so many reviewers here have done -- that this film is good because it deals with taboo subjects in an open and ironic manner.  Successful dark comedy requires more than that; it needs a dramatic raison d'etre as well as a conscience.  \"Happiness\" has neither. It moves like treacle from one blank stare to another.  It attempts to involve the unsuspecting viewer as a co-conspirator in one Krafft-Ebbing scenario after another.  It is as base and loathsome as the pornographic images it conjures -- but disingenuously avoids -- in the viewer's mind.Moreover, the dialogue seems carefully crafted to appeal not to the kind of sophisticated audience who might, just might, find some truly redeeming moments of cleverness or originality, but to children. In that respect, it insults the intelligence as well as the sensitivity of any discerning and mature adult.  I detest that kind of manipulation.  It is commercially exploitative.

            "content": "Different aspects of Todd Solondz's film, 'Happiness', remind one of other movies. For its overall structure and the presence of Philip Seymour Hoffman in the cast, one thinks of Paul Thomas Anderson's 'Magnolia'; the portrait of dysfunctional families in suburbia brings to mind the films of Mike Leigh and Hal Hartley; the (literally) seminal humour is a far stronger version of that in 'There's Something About Mary', or 'American Pie'; while the general comedy of embarrassment, and subject material that includes paedophilia, has parallels in the work of Chris Morris. Of course, when a film reminds one of so many others, that means that either it is hopelessly derivative, or, as is happily the case for this movie, a true original. The films opening credits conclude with the announcement of its title with a splendid comic timing that tells you from the start that the meaning of the word is wholly ironic; and that there'll be no joy for its antonymously-named heroine. The overall effect is over-the-top, but when even supposedly satirical films like 'American Beauty' and 'Donnie Darko' chose to put a certain gloss on their portrait of the American suburbs, a film as brutal as this one serves as a certain refreshing antidote. It's not flawless; it's a little too set up to shock, and because of this, lacks the depth to really sustain its length; and some of the humour pushes the boundaries of comedy beyond what's truly funny. In fact, some of the best moments are the gentler ones, like when dippy Joy sings her ode to happiness on acoustic guitar. It's probably a good thing that all movies aren't this extreme; but it's certainly one film you're unlikely to forget in a hurry.",

            "content": "This is the excellent movie John Waters wishes he could make, if he only had the talent; it has all the ingredients of a JW movie: perversion, satire of the middle class, sexual deviancy, etc. This fascinating and sometimes hilarious film is not so much about the human condition (as pretentious critics like to say) as it is about the sub-human condition; most characters, if not all, are either depraved, deeply neurotic, egotistical or just plain insane, and most of them are entirely pathetic. Some (idiots) dismiss this as \"shock cinema\" much in the way they would dismiss Howard Stern as a mere \"shock jock\". But that is a big mistake. This movie has more basis in reality than most of the acclaimed, \"respected\" dramas made by the likes of Spielberg, Van Sant or Reiner, combined.First of all, the film is undoubtedly funny. Secondly, the characterizations are excellent - very well fleshed-out. Thirdly, the dialogues are fresh and original. Fourthly, how many satires/comedies can last over two hours without being boring? Fifthly, there are many surprising and clever character developments. Plus, the photography is a rather nice bonus. Obviously, the most outrageous deviancy is the psychiatrist who offers to show his son how to masturbate, and later drugs/rapes his son's friend; this was certainly on the brink of bad taste, but it was done in such a way that the pedophile Dad was funny, which is a pretty amazing accomplishment; it's hard to make a character as despicable as that appear so comical and pathetic. The urgency, anxiety and excitement with which he prepares the tuna sandwich for the \"gay boy\" is an example of this. But the funniest scene is when Seymour collapses into the arms of the fat female neighbour and rants about wanting pussy (though not hers). Just for the record, these are some of the things that occur in the movie, either as spoken, imagined or actual: spree-killing, pedophilia, rape of a drugged minor, murder and mutilation, theft of a stereo and a guitar, masturbation of an adult, masturbation of a boy, sperm hitting a wall, sperm hitting a balcony, a dog licking human semen, sex-abuse over the phone, suicide, rape of a fat woman by a near-midget, and vomiting. The more conservative, less open-minded and/or squeamish viewers may want to vomit themselves, but all of this isn't as extreme as it sounds; things are mostly spoken of or suggested - the rest is left to the ((un)willing) imagination. The only complaint I might have is that Jarred Harris is in this, though his character is \u0096 thank God - quite marginal. The talentless fluke that he is, he plays a Russian with an Italian accent. Seymour, an actor I don't particularly like, is actually quite good as the sexually-frustrated ugly guy. Another stand-out is Jane Adams, as the failure/insecure woman. But the most perfect casting is Dylan Baker's; he plays the pedophile but looks like a young version of Jimmy Carter!

A hollow, impotent Pink Flamingos wannabe that chooses easy subjects of provocation to just appease expendable income chic cine-masochists and leaves the more human among us asking why people's time and money was wasted on this spiteful, one note effort. Most insultingly, it has the nerve to ask us to care for its squirm suburban paranoia caricatures whilst simultaneously breaking out the Farley Brothers level of gross out humour every opportunity it can. Insincerity is the most evident sign of amateurism in a storyteller and this adolescent effort is the most blatant example I've ever come across in film. Worse than non-action, insincerity or a lack of moral stance is the bane of independent filmmaking, more often than not it's not an effort towards greater truth but rather one towards covering up an immature or trivial concept or a weak surface value vision which is what we have here. Todd Solondz aims just to cause his audience pain and even if he had higher aspirations, they definitely are not evident on screen, and if laughing at other people's misery is your idea of the epitome of cinema, well you are beyond help and your fabricated soul has no place being anywhere near a film screen. Your kind will have your time soon and it will be a spacious, lengthy, dark time. Admittedly, I should check out more from the wasteful decade of American independent cinema that spawned this faux-intellectual piece of inhumanity before I say anything too concrete, god forbid, but for now I'll just say bluntly that this film, and its defendants, can go to hell despite them not being flammable, what with all the fibre glass and all",

            "content": "This one will knock your socks off even if you aren't wearing any socks. I dare you to watch it. I double-dare you.But first a few words. This is about sex. Not your Cinderella meets Prince Charming sex. Not your boy meets girls sex at all, or not exactly. This is more like REAL sex, the kind you don't talk about. This is about several varieties of sex, most of them perverted or deviant and/or illegal in most states. And this is about \"happiness\" in only the most ironic sense of the word.Yet, somehow this movie seems...well, not uplifting, heaven forbid, but somehow reassuring in a strange way. I guess what happens is that after all the perversions, the hang-ups, the unrequited desires, the bizarro fantasies, the unnatural desires, the depraved acts, the exploitation, the sheer desperation of the biological imperative, somehow with the family sitting around the dinner table at the end, somehow we are reassured that life not only goes on, but things could be worse.It is interesting that director Todd Solondz--who previously gave us the captivating and totally original Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995), a strikingly truthful look at the middle child in junior high school--spun this out the way he did. The story is really about three sisters and their parents and the dysfunctional sex that they encounter and the pitiable/ normal lives they live. Solondz could have begun with having us meet the sisters one by one like some kind of chick flick with the expectation that we will find out about their lives and their loves. Instead he starts from another angle, and only gradually does it develop that this really IS about their lives and loves.Well, their lives and loves are a bit beyond kinky or pathetic, and yet they are so very like the lives and loves so many people lead--if only we knew. By the way, at times the film is belly laugh funny.Starring are Jane Adams (Joy), Lara Flynn Boyle (Helen), and Cynthia Stevenson (Trish) as the three sisters. Joy is the wallflower at the dance of life, Helen is the hard as a stiletto woman of fashion, accomplishment and beauty who can't find the right man, and Trish is the desperate housewife \"happily\" married to a man who is a homosexual pedophile and a psychiatrist. Dylan Baker plays the shrink who can't help himself in a way that makes it tough for the audience not to identify with his problem. He is so honest with his son and so clearly loves his son and his wife that we are almost won over. Almost. We do NOT see him with the boys he exploits, and in this way perhaps Solondz has stacked the deck. Still a movie that paints a pedophile in anything close to a positive light deserves credit for courage if nothing else.The other characters who are anything but sympathetic in an objective assessment--one is a murderer--somehow come across as being vulnerable instead of monstrous. Perhaps Joy, who is so hopeful and so very, very vulnerable, is the one who most inspires our sympathy. The Russian who frankly admits he's a thief and exploits Joy seems more despicable than anyone in the film. Perhaps. I think it really depends on your point of view, your sexuality and perhaps your individual experience.Ben Gazzara is the father who is just sick of his wife, and Louise Lasser (whom I haven't seen since she starred in the offbeat TV sit com \"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman\" from the seventies) plays the wife. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a guy who is terrified of performing with women, but gets his jollies dialing strangers on the phone and talking dirty. Camryn Manheim plays the large woman who wants intimacy but finds sex disgusting.I think you've got the picture. This is sexual dysfunction as TV's Lifetime would never have it. Solondz's intent seems to be to demonstrate the truth of the adage \"To know all is to forgive all.\" He also does a good job of showing that although we think we are the self that makes the decisions, maybe it is true that our biology overrides our intentions.This is decidedly not for the straitlaced or the intolerant. This the sort of movie that is so terrifying to social conservatives that they won't even attack it for fear that such an attack would only give it greater currency.See this for Todd Solondz who is a film maker of verve and insight, a humanist who is not afraid to shock the bourgeoisie.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

            "review_title": "The films of Todd Solondz",
            "content": "Like Woody Allen, director Todd Solondz spends his time poking fun at man's petty desires, foibles and beliefs, whilst perhaps simultaneously wishing he weren't such a dweeb and part of the very social fabric he condemns. It's the classic ego trap: \"I'm better and above you, but worthless and wish I were with you.\" Solondz made \"Fear, Anxiety and Depression\" in 1989. He wrote and directed that film and, like Woody Allen, also cast himself as the film's neurotic hero. Like Allen's alter ego in \"Annie Hall\", the geeky looking Solondz spent the entire film bumbling about, venting his various dissaffections.Solondz was never happy with \"Fear, Anxiety and Depression\" (hehehe), however, and promptly disowned the film when his producers re-edited it behind his back. Burnt by the film industry, Solondz slipped into depression. He cut himself off from the world and became a teacher and writer. During these years his approach to art changed drastically. His screenplays became more formal, more precise, more caustic, and his visual style became cold. Ice cold.Solondz's first film when he emerged from his depression was \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\". Drawing upon his own unhappy school years, \"Dollhouse\" is about Dawn Weiner, a girl whom the universe seems to have condemned. More sinister than similar teen movies, \"Dollhouse's\" Dawn is so insecure she's happy to let a kid at school rape her if it means validating her own existence. This would be rapist is himself marginalized, insecure and so reliant on sexual threats for self validation. Similarly, Dawn is so filled with rage she saws off the heads of her sister's dolls, fantasises about bashing people with a hammer and deliberately causes her sibling to be kidnapped by a local paedophile. Meanwhile, all the swear words and abuses people hurl at the geeky Dawn, Dawn hurls down at her little sister, a girl whom she unfairly despises. The result is that Dawn is shown to be capable of the same kind of brutality that she's subjected to. Social bullying is internalised, becomes self-hatred, and is then redirected violently back out at others.\"Dollhouse\" was a cosy film compared to Solondz's next three flicks. In \"Happiness\" he portrays a web of characters, all of whom harbour different problems and neuroses, but are nevertheless linked by their desire for absolute contentment. And so we have a paedophile who is only happy around kids, a successful writer who is only happy if she writes something of substance, a musician (who ironically writes songs of substance) who can't find success and is so discontent, an elderly couple who no longer have the will to live, a fat man who fantasises about raping women, a fat woman who is disgusted by sex and a seemingly satisfied housewife who is blissfully unaware of the disturbing truths that exist beneath her sweet suburban facade. Forget \"American Beauty\" and \"Blue Velvet\". Solondz ends his film with a Norman Rockwell kid ejaculating on his front balcony. Solondz's point: lack breeds desire breeds suffering. Peel away the emotional baggage and happiness is a stain that oft amounts to nothing more than a fleeting moment of biological bliss.\"Happiness\" doesn't broadening its horizons to tackle the wider social and structural issues that better directors align to their existential musings, but it does offer more than Sam Mendes' \"American Beauty\". Indeed, Solondz's next film, \"Storytelling\", seemed designed to address those critics who pointed out the similarities between \"Happiness\" and \"American Beauty\". Mendes has himself slammed Solondz on numerous occasions, and so perhaps \"Storytelling\" is best viewed as a sort of intellectual assault on Solondz's critics.\"Storytelling\" is divided into two segments, the first called \"fiction\" the second called \"non-fiction\". \"Fiction\" is about a creative writing student who has \"sympathy sex\" with a \"retarded\" kid and later lets her black teacher \"rape\" her. She then turns her experiences into a work of fiction which purports to be \"truthfully\" based on these factual encounters.\"Storytelling's\" second segment is about a documentary director who makes a documentary called \"American Scooby\" (a parody of \"American Beauty\") in which he follows a high school student around campus. The documentary director hopes to uncover the \"truth\" of growing up in suburbia, but in reality is merely transposing his own \"deep thoughts\", self-analysis and existential hang-ups onto a modern teen who is actually a dopey airhead. The end result is that film-maker and child enter a sort of exploitative relationship. The kid gets fame and is portrayed as being \"deeper\" than he is, while the film-maker gets prestige for nothing. End result: Solondz essentially advocates the sort of \"truthful\" sensationalism present in the non-fiction segment of the film, whilst aligning human delusions (love, romantic illusions, family etc) with the fictions of the second half. Other themes abound - the power games and domination/exploitation reversals of \"Dollhouse\" are reworked here with subplots about a vengeful maid and a black teacher - but it's the \"American Beauty\" angle that's most interesting.\"Palindromes\" is thus far the weakest of Solondz's films. The first and last words in the movie are \"Mom\", a pair of palindromes through which Solondz implies that \"nothing ever changes\". Indeed, Solondz makes the film a palindrome at every level, his point being that we are paradoxically always changing and never changing (hence different actors play the same character), every desire and addiction merely supplanting another. It's an extremely bleak film, depending how much trust the audience puts in its final monologue. This bleakness has led to critics labelling Solondz a misanthrope, but he's no more colder than both Allen and the Coens, two other contemporary critical darlings who've spent their careers reworking similar material.7.9/10 \u2013 \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\", \"Palindromes\" 8/10 \u2013 \"Storytelling\", \"Happiness\"",

It was brand new, hot out of distribution, and I'd heard of Todd Solondz as a filmmaker who dared to make \"different\" films, which I figured meant \"superior.\" See, it worked as entertainment, the acting and photography was fine. And yeah, it WAS \"different.\" A pedophile is shown in a sympathetic light. Some fat loser uses his own jizz to stick pictures to the wall of his tiny studio apartment. Yeah, that's different. But what was the point in showing us all this sh*t? And why is it even entertaining to watch? Because the movie conditions me to think that this is reality, and that I should join the director in being comfortable with reality. Like, if these sick situations are so common that all these people are having them at once, then I should be cool with it and be a little proud of how this movie enlightened me.It's scary how they pulled this off. Young and impressionable, I ignored how disgusting and bereft of meaning this movie was because it LOOKED good and I understood it was \"hip.\" I ate it up and almost fifteen years later, the foul aftertaste still lingers in the back of my mind.Ugh. Everything's propaganda now. I have had my share of sickness, and this movie isn't \"groundbreakingly truthful,\" I think it's the director trying to convince everyone else of his deeply cynical and unrealistic view of middle- class America. Also, I don't know how this would play out in reality, but I doubt that a little boy getting sodomized by a grown man during a drugged stupor would just wake up the next morning without being being very upset and in a lot of pain. Exploiting child rape and trying to pull it off like it's dark comedy, there should be a name for that. Something that means \"vapid and often offensive bullsh*t masquerading as having substance.\" I think \"hipster crack\" is a good enough term. There's just something off about it, something fake, something truly sick and immature. Like a friendly kid who wears expensive clothes and has lots of cool stuff, but when you visit his house he wants to play by torturing cats.",

The constant back-and-forth between bitterly dark comedy and hyper-realistic portrayal prevented real insight, and instead encouraged an almost snide, voyeristic amusement.On the other hand, this film is to be applauded for attempting to deal with subject matter. I didn't get the feeling that Solondz personally views his characters as spiteful or pathetic, but instead that he wanted to \"lighten\" the burden on the audience by creating ironic distance. If he can keep the same very high level of acting and writing in his next film, without relying on cheap irony, he'll produce a film which is hard to ignore.",

This takes a unflinching look at just how disturbing life in suburban America can be. Happiness predates American Beauty by a year and is such a profoundly disturbing, original and thought provoking experience in cinema that is absolutely uncompromising and strong in its presentation of the darkest corners of suburbia. The movie is very clever and wickedly funny. The dialouge is brilliant and performances are magnificent from the ensemble cast, many of which would go on to be big stars, like Philip Seymour Hoffman. Happiness, is not a mainstream movie by any means and won't appeal to everybody. However, Happiness is very well made and I think the film is outstanding.",

            "content": "I only rented this film because lots of other IMDb reviewers compare it to American Beauty, a film I really enjoyed.  Indeed, many reviewers insist this movie is the better of the two.  I shouldn't have listened.I'd be lying if I said I didn't understand how other people can like this movie.  I do.  This is one of those films that receives such labels as \"daring\" or \"honest\" simply because it addresses subject matter that most films wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole.  Thus, many see genius in such a film only because it is unlike other movies.  Well, I've got to say, there's a difference between \"daring\" and \"exploitive,\" and there's a huge difference between \"honest\" and \"gratuitous.\"  Too bad director/screenwriter Todd Solondz apparently isn't aware of that.  Are all the disgusting visuals and gross sexual conversations really necessary?  Hasn't Solondz ever heard of subtlety?To put things into perspective, here are some other movies that I really liked, all of which are commonly considered offensive.  I loved Magnolia.  I thought Pulp Fiction was excellent.  The Big Lebowski was superb.  Fight Club was kind of cool.But Happiness is trash, the lowest form of trash.  Not content to assault his audience with the usual brand of sexual depravity, Solondz revels in VIOLENT sexual depravity.  True, Solondz might not be endorsing this behavior, but he is exploiting it and he is going too far.  Watching this movie goes something like this.  Someone does or says something unbelievably disgusting.  You say to yourself, \"Wow, I can't believe that just happened.\" Like a minute later, something even nastier happens.  Again, you say to yourself, \"Okay, that was gross.  Why was that necessary?\"  By the end of the movie you're like, \"Why did I watch it all?  I should have stopped ten minutes into it.  Nothing in this movie was necessary.  Everything goes too far.  Every point this movie tries to make could have been made without being that gross.\"In his/her review, \"evilpays\" makes the claim that anyone who's offended by this movie \"needs to take a long look at themselves\" because it \"probably hit too close to home.\"  Well, that's like saying that people who don't like Shakespeare are literate or that people who hate Titanic are sentimental.  I WAS offended by Happiness, not so much because its content was disgusting, but because that content was sold to me as being something profound.  I've been had, and I am a little mad about it.  And by the way, the cameo appearances by Jon Lovitz and Molly Shannon only serve to make this movie creepy on top of everything else.Happiness is quite easily the single worst movie I've ever seen.  And I've seen Anaconda - I've seen Leonard Part 6 - I've seen Pauly Shore's Jury Duty.  None compare.  American Beauty was NOTHING like this garbage. 1/10",

The strange thing is that I enjoyed it.  -Not so much while it was playing. It's sheer agony to watch.  Enjoyment comes, if at all, afterwards.So ... WHY is it agony to watch?  Certainly not because we're presented with repulsive images.  We're not.  (If we had been, the film could not possibly have been worth watching, just as a novel consisting of ugly prose could not possibly be worth reading.)  The agony comes entirely from the characters. We dread what they will do or say next; we dread what will happen to them next; we dread what they will reveal about themselves next.  We dread until we have sunk deep into our seats and our hands are covering our eyes.  I have no idea how Solondz managed to make us care about these people so much. It's harder than he makes it look.The most sympathetic character, by far, is the paedophile.  He's intelligent, for most of the time he means well, despite the dark things going on his mind; perhaps the most sympathetic thing about him is that he's intelligent enough to KNOW that there are dark things going on in his mind. He's a good father and we know he would never, whatever his desires, molest his own son.  The last thing I wanted was for him to be caught and humiliated.  (I'm ignoring the killing-spree fantasy he reveals at one point, but this was a gratuitous add-on, unworthy of the rest of the film. It's best ignored.)The coincidences that either plague or enliven other ensemble pictures are present in this one as well.  The psychiatrist's patient just happens to be his wife's sister's neighbour... actually, that's the only such coincidence I can think of... in fact, now that I come to think of it, it isn't even a problem, since although this coincidence is meaningless it does no work: the film would still be as coherent a whole without it.  Which is not to say that it's a perfectly coherent whole in the way that - well, a REALLY first-rate is.  Oh well.  Solondz presumably knew when he set to work on \"Happiness\" that a film consisting of grey vignettes could not be more than a minor artistic success.  At least it IS a minor artistic success.P.S.:  I love the camerawork.  Everything, every single room, streetscape and prop that we see, is dull, cold, and antiseptic.  Even on the rare occasions when a room is messy it manages to be messy in a completely lifeless way.  Everything is so blandly UGLY.  Yet the photography is never itself ugly.  Ditto the script: it depicts little but ugliness without itself being ugly.",

Of course, that is not in and of itself a particularly compelling reason to spend two hours and fifteen minutes watching a movie.  Why, then, could I not change the channel when I caught it on HBO?The short answer to the preceding question is that Happiness is mesmerizing. The profundity of the perversion involved and \"patheticness\" of every single character evoke a greater emotional reaction in the viewer than any formulaic Hollywood yawnfest ever could.  Beyond that, I feel somewhat uncomfortable discussing the film's merits.  Most of Happiness's central themes go unarticulated in the film itself, and it seems somewhat trite to try articulating them here.I should add that I was somewhat surprised by how positive a reaction Happiness has received amongst IMDB reviewers.  Certainly, this movie is not for everyone.  Sexual deviance, bleakness, and frustration are all too pervasive in our culture.  However, this does not make for entertaining viewing, and those who tend to prefer escapist cinema to the more realistic (or something) fare would do well to avoid Happiness.  That said, the film has a great deal to offer the more adventurous viewer, and is definitely worth checking out when in the right sort of mood (though I must say I'm not quite certain as to what that mood is).7/10",

Todd Solondz, the director/writer is all about pushing the viewer's boundaries and comfort zones.'Do you really love me no matter what?' a scene where Bill Maplewood asks his wife, Trish the very question we all ask our loved ones at some point. His character is aware of the depraved nature of his being yet he functions as a good parent, a respected member of society yet underneath he admits he's sick meanwhile his wife ironically thinks they have a perfect life and while Trish lives a life of constant comparison to one sister who is a success story and another who is a failure. Her illness is one of gratification by this very daily contrast.Helen's character is one who has the admiration, the success and attention of everybody yet she's still not happy, to her own detriment, as her self-critical nature will not allow happiness, with a scene where she repeats to herself \"I'm zero, I'm no good. I'm nothing, nothing.\" then without a beat the phone rings giving her exactly what she wants, Allen describing exactly how she feels \"You are empty. You are a zero. You are a black hole.'Philip Seymour Hoffman's character Allen is a great example of how many men live their lives. Feeling like outsiders, almost alien to beautiful women. His character is one of considerable irony as he mentions early in the film \"See if she only knew how I felt. deep down if I really cared for her, respected her. She would love me back.\" Is this line full of deep despair but more importantly irony as Allen gratifies his sexual desires by cold calling random women speaking to them in degrading ways to satisfy his sexual needs yet he can't even say more than a hello in person.Even Joy's character, one of sadness and melancholy where nothing seems to go right for her seems to have been doomed right from the beginning for just having the name Joy. Happiness is a great movie overall, a great cast and it serves as unique work of cinema as there aren't many films like it.How do you feel at the end?, well unlike Bill's character after his dream, you don't wake up happy, feeling good.you get very depressed, because you're back living in reality.",

Adopting a veneer of ironic detachment, but still wanting to seem to be making a statement, Solondz badly misses the mark. Praise has been heaped on the purported socio-realism of this work, but the bulk of the movie is premised on manipulative \"look what I can get away with\" shock value, often in the from of heaping additional degradations on the characters, for no apparent purpose other than to really cram their lives down the toilet.  Essentially, the movie is saying that many people are really screwed up and have bad lives, but offers nothing more than that superficial insight.  While the movie does show glimpses of sincerity, Solondz constantly undermines any realism by utilizing cheap jokes -- the 11-year old masturbating, dog licking up the ejaculate, the mother kissing the dog and the boy bragging about his orgasm -- this isn't as much tasteless as thoroughly at odds with the overall subject matter of the film. Thus, the pedophaelia plot -- which might have been better as the subject of a whole, fully developed movie -- never achieved full effectiveness.

No, Happiness is a disturbingly harrow tale, not unlike Magnolia, which features characters universally in a state of despair.Happiness follows the lives of a collection of people who all have a link with each other whether they know it or not. It doesn't necessarily contain a plot as we know it, rather it studies each character as they struggle to fight their own respective demons;Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Allen, conveys a lonely, sad man whose existence revolves around sex, or his obsession about his lack of it. He's in lust for one neighbour who barely acknowledges him, and he 'satisfies' himself by calling random numbers and talking to females while 'doing the business'.\nDylan Baker is Bill, on the surface a balanced, happily married psychologist. Under it he's a disturbed sick paedophile - his character is incredibly well handled because we never feel totally appalled by him (Though we do feel appalled by his sickness), rather we have a slight level of sympathy for him because he knows he's sick and is in a perennial state of despair.Jane Adams is Joy Jordan who's never quite managed to get a hold of her life and seize the day. She's living a frustrated existence and doesn't know what to with herself. Her 2 sisters Cynthia (Married to Bill) and Helen have their own issues too, and patronise Joy 'expecting more from her' - Helen in particular has become a huge success through her writing but underneath is a total fraud and she knows it.These are the main characters, though there are many more, and it's ultimately a study of them, like Magnolia. It is extremely well acted as we would expected from the class of player here, and the direction is subtle and allows the story to flow. Granted you won't be thrilled at any point, but it is pretty gripping stuff in context of how the characters develop.The main problem with the movie is who it is aimed at, because it is harrowing and distressing fare, really. Paedophilia, loneliness, rape, emptiness, murder, frustration, and futile despair tend not to be attractive themes, especially when they're so graphically portrayed as they are here. If you can tolerate such ideas, then you might appreciate this movie which never pulls a punch. It's treading a fine line, but just has enough dignity not to be sensationalistic, rather, just raw.One last thing - I really don't see it as a comedy drama, as it advertises itself. It's a dark drama with the occasional amusing moment.PS: As the 11 year old Billy, Bill's son, Rufus Read is outstanding.",

Self-centeredness is the chief characteristic of nearly everyone in this film.At two hours and 20 minutes,\"Happiness\" rambles a bit, but the strength of these characters is undeniable.

For Solondz, man is trapped in an everlasting attempt to find an unattainable happiness. He is doomed to fail in this quest and will remain unfulfilled and worse, condemned to eternal loneliness. This holds for people of all ages and from all strata's of society. Besides the core of the central family, there are other characters as varied as a poor Russian immigrant taxi driver/thief, a very overweight well intentioned psychotic, males who are perceived physically unappealing in the forms of Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Jon Lovits, and a Hispanic doorman. None of the above is exempt from the life sentence Solendz contends we are all faced with, not even sexy Lara Flynn Boyle as a successful novelist. There is no salvation. Unsurprisingly most of these characters at some point will attempt to achieve some respite in the form of sex. Most will fail. The one character to succeed in fulfilling his sexual fantasy will pay the heaviest price.Existential gloom is not new to the cinema. Bergman became internationally renowned for this. Solondz expresses little compassion for his characters, neither does he present them in a tragic light. Instead he opts for a deadpan humor, coaxing us to laugh at these pathetic people not out of affection or understanding, but rather simply as a response to life as he sees it. On a first time viewing the sheer despondency of these characters seems to overwhelm the humor, but watching the film again, the humor seemed far more blatant.The performances are uniformly superb. The entire cast seems to respond wonderfully to Solondz's direction, including the child performers. This is testament to his prodigious talent, which unfortunately was not used to the same effect in the following \"Storytelling\". Obviously this is not a movie for everyone, since this bleak view on human life is clearly not shared by all. But still, this is a work which is undeniably a masterpiece of sorts.",

Mona going to the estate agents is a scene that cries out her desperate loneliness. Joy is constantly sad, but pretends not to be. Philip Seymour Hoffman is quite amazing as a sexual pervert. The most disturbing thing though, is the final scene when Dr Maplewood is asked by his son abut his alleged pedophilia. I wonder, what does the child actor's parents think when they learnt of their son having to say such lines? \"Happiness\" is certainly not a happy film. it makes people think what happiness is, or whether they are happy or not.

This sort of thing seems to be popular lately: making films that are, in reality, about nothing but contain a great deal of shocking scenes and bits intended to make the audience feel uncomfortable.

What was completely lacking was a \"movie\". \"Happiness\" was not an interesting story: the audience feels no empathy for any of the characters (who are, for the most part, disgustingly perverse and/or completely self-absorbed and obnoxious). Furthermore, as a dark comedy about life's \"realities\", the film falls short again, portraying everyday people as pedophiles, Jeffrey Dahmer style murderers, ignorant housewives, perverted crank callers, beautiful and self-absorbed writers, and weak minded doormats for abusive boyfriends and family members. None of the scenes intended to be funny are actually funny. \"Happiness\" does little more than shock and disgust, with many of the most disgusting scenes being completely unnecessary to the film.

Not an easy task for a director to pull off.  It made me cringe, but it was well done.   And the lonely guy making obscene phone calls actually comes across as a sympathetic person, also. Great.  Well done.  The movie is populated with unsatisfied characters. None of them *happy* with their achievements in life.  Fine, now tie it all together. Effectively, that is. There are several different subplots, but they are sloppily juggled.     And the pacing is often fatal.  The opening dinner scene with Jon Lovitz probably only lasts five minutes, but feels like eternity.  The awkward (more boring than awkward, actually) silence as the obscene phone caller sits on the couch with Lara Flynn Boyle.  Almost every scene between the obscene-phone guy and a female neighbor who wants him is slow bits of nothingness. (Spoilers coming up)        And I nearly kicked my tv when we learn that a certain character has killed somebody and is storing the body in a freezer.  Having a character casually talk about such a murder is an obviously trendy gimmick.  Like, \"they're eating ice cream as she talks about having killed somebody!  This movie is so weird, man!\".

What's even worse is that it tries to trick you into thinking that it's a movie \"to be taken seriously\" because everybody's a sex addict and everybody's miserable and everybody throws up. In case you didn't get it: the title \"Happiness\" is used for its opposite meaning. What saves this pretentious movie from is essentially its great cast, especially that little boy whose father is a pedophile. He essentially played an un- pitchable child role. What an impressive and mature performance!The first forty minutes or so are very interesting in terms of character evolution, but there's no use for you to look at your watch, because these are only forty minutes out of one hundred and forty minutes worth of very, very, very pointless controversy wrapped in very, very, very unaesthetic cinematography. Long story short, this is a movie where very promising satire and sarcasm is dumped for explicit material. As a matter of fact, everything that the characters do seems to be for shock value. The grandfather who pours tons of salt on his plate despite his doctor's recommendations (no need to shoot further scenes to elaborate of course). The neighbour who phone-harrasses women and ends up drunk and pukes everywhere. The little boy who, after six laborious months, finally shoots his cum, has his dog eat it and joyfully tells his entire family that he had an orgasm. Please.Yes, a scene like the one where a father suggests demonstrating masturbation to his son will surprise you, shock you, make you smile, make you laugh, offend you, make you applaud the writer for his unapologetic manners, but once you're past the effect, Happiness will leave no room for you to reflect in any way, for the simple reason that there's nothing to reflect about since everything's done for the sake of spontaneous disgust and/or offence. If you want good sarcasm, taboo topics and impeccable cinematography, check out \"Sitcom\" by Fran\u00e7ois Ozon, where a mother decides to sleep with her gay son to \"cure\" him from his homosexuality. It has an irresistibly witty and sarcastic dialogue, an asset that \"Happiness\" crucially lacks. When you want to be honest with people with topics as delicate as pedophilia, you need something to counter-balance it. Pasolini shot the most shocking sexual scenes in history but he had the most poetic cinematography and sound track to back it up with! It is one thing to push people's buttons to make them reflect on something and a totally different thing to go for shock value. Happiness is not the former.",

Yet it's not just about shock effects. The apparently fearless Todd Solondz has made a real movie here, with real characters, no matter how depraved, and it is the skill, intelligence, and precision of his approach that give the discomfort (and the laughs) that rare quality: a true edge. If you can imagine some bizarre collaboration between Luis Bunuel, R. Crumb, and middle-period Woody Allen you might get an idea of what you're in for here.As with Bunuel, Solondz' detached yet avid attention focuses less on condemnation than on watching what his characters do next. It isn't good: Hoffman, as a shy, inarticulate loner, releases his sexual frustration in abusive phone calls; Adams, as a sad-eyed, idealistic musician, floats from mishap to mishap like a semi-deflated balloon -- never rising yet never quite sinking either; Baker, playing a tortured family-man/therapist/pedophile, turns to predation. The sequences involving this last character constitute the movie's most quease-inducing thread, yet Baker's extraordinary performance, and that of the young actor Rufus Read as his son, make their scenes heartbreaking as well. (It should be noted that the cast all around is excellent, down to brief but memorable work by Jon Lovitz and Camryn Manheim.)Solondz never softens: every time you think you sense a turn for the better in the whole business, something (rape, murder, suicide, theft) screws up the works. But the movie is ultimately about happiness, as both the title and the endearingly drippy song Adams performs remind us -- how fleeting it is, and how difficult to attain, and yet how transfiguring, even when it passes us by. I have not yet watched Solondz's other works, but I was impressed enough by the assurance of this one to seek them out. Movie-making as good as this is worth squirming for.",

It focuses on the lives of a group of men and women who engage in shocking antisocial behaviour, the title by the way is a joke (but there's also a song called \"Happiness\", and the last scene there's a toast to happiness). The shocking behaviour includes obscene phone calls by Allen (Capote's Philip Seymour Hoffman), murder and paedophilia by Bill Maplewood (Dylan Baker), there are also basic tragic events such as break ups, Bill's son Timmy (Justin Elvin) who wants to be a grown up (by producing cum) and questionable love stories. This tragicomedy may have lack of moral judgement, and you (the audience) may be the ones to make your own minds up about the events, but there are still plenty of giggles in the sick circumstances, and you can feel pity and get drawn in to most of the people's lives. Also starring Jane Adams as Joy Jordan, Jon Lovitz as Andy Kornbluth, Men in Black 2's Lara Flynn Boyle as Helen Jordan, Louise Lasser as Mona Jordan, Ben Gazzara as Lenny Jordan, Jared Harris as Vlad, Marla Maples as Ann Chambeau, Elizabeth Ashley as Diane Freed and Molly Shannon as Nancy. For me the most engaging stories were: lonely Allen calling Joy and masturbating, and then calling her sister Helen and really letting out his sexual desires, and when they actually meet, they don't do it; and paedophile Bill, who is both comforting his questioning and worrying son, and he has feelings for his young best friend, and there is that gripping scene where he admits to his son Timmy that he f***ed him! Certainly not a film to miss. It won a prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. Very good!",

If I find myself on IMDb following the watching of said movie, reading message board posts and seeing what others had to say about it, that's a good sign. If I find myself retelling the plot, in detail, to my wife, that's also a good sign. Both of these signs were fulfilled following the watching of \"Happiness\" and after going through an entire day not really knowing whether to accept or reject this film (I watched it last night), I think I've finally decided. I think it's a really great movie, despite some really appalling and disgusting subject matter. You see, that's not really easy for me to admit because I'd seen \"Happiness\" once before and in fact, I used to own \"Happiness\" on DVD (a blind buy purely because Philip Seymour Hoffman was a part of the cast - I used to love that guy...still do). It sat on my DVD shelf for years and when I finally broke down and gave it a watch, I hated it. I'm pretty sure I didn't waste any time selling it away and figured I'd never watch it again. Well, apparently I didn't know about THE BOOK then and when THE BOOK came along, I realized I'd have to give it one more go around. I think that pretty much brings us up to speed on where I stand with this movie. This time, I had absolutely no problem sitting through this over two hour movie, which felt more like forty-five minutes. Solondz used his time very wisely and didn't take a second of his film for granted, cramming in something essential during every scene.It's a controversial piece, there's no denying that. It's a film that will certainly leave your casual movie goer with a dropped jaw and probably turn off a lot of people. I won't deny that there were times during the picture where I felt dirty and disgusting for even watching it and even more so, for enjoying it. Certainly I'm, for the most part, talking about the storyline involving Dylan Baker. However, the film (in a way) redeems itself for giving us a few happy moments, moments of closure and letting us know that, at least these characters recognize their wrongdoing, which is more than we get in real life sometimes. The short scene where Bill Maplewood turns to his half sleeping wife, in bed and tells her that \"he's sick\", not referring to a virus he may have picked up, but rather that he's sick for being a pedophile. He's sobbing at the time and really, I thought that was a brilliant inclusion and I wonder what I would've thought of that storyline if that scene had been omitted. There's another nice scene where Allen finally realizes that the girls he calls on the phone and more notably Helen, are never going to accept him or find him appealing and that his other neighbor, Kristina will. So he goes to her apartment and lies down with her; Allen on top of the blankets, she underneath. It's a nod to the fact that neither of them really like the physical act of sex. Allen gets off on being distanced from his objects of desire (his penchant for using the phone) and Kristina has been raped, so neither will she find sex an appealing activity. They're perfect for each other - awkward and perfect.So as much as people want to condemn Todd Solondz for making \"Happiness\", I'd rather applaud him. Why? Because these sorts of people do exist. Who knows what goes on when people lock their doors and pull their curtains at night. People have all sorts of perversions and turn ons, whether you're a doctor, living in the 'burbs or a regular guy, living in an apartment. Some of our turn ons are fairly run of the mill, but behind a lot of locked doors there are a real sickos: pedophiles, rapists and the like; and then there's guy's like Allen, a little odd, but for the most part, harmless. So thank you Todd Solondz for not shying away from this sort of subject matter and facing it and even more so for being able to find a little humor in it and even more so for adding those few classy touches, in a film that really has no place being classy. For people who say they don't like this movie, but secretly do, I understand. For people who say they don't like this movie and mean it, I don't understand. I'll certainly NEVER bash anyone's personal opinion, but I do apologize if you're offended by \"Happiness\". I apologize if every film can't be roses & puppy dogs and I apologize that as long as there are directors like Todd Solondz, there will be filmmakers who aren't afraid to grab reality by the horns and show us what's really going on.RATING: 8/10",

            "content": "I'm sure there are some people who still refuse to watch \"Happiness.\" When it was originally released, Todd Solondz's controversial ensemble film caused quite a stir for some of its subject matter. The critics were sharply divided between those who found it a brilliant piece of work and those who thought it was the product of a sick mind. This is not surprising, when you consider that it deals with pedophilia, stalkers, and masturbation, among numerous other things. Now that it's been four years, the firestorm has simmered down, and we can view the film through a much more objective lens. Bottom line: is it a good movie? For the most part, yes it is. Despite some of the potentially distasteful subject matter, It's a solid character study, offering an honest, realistic look at suburban loneliness and alienation. Even at their worst, the characters are not judged; the director simply allows their actions to speak for themselves. No matter how much we may despise some of their actions, we never see them as monsters, but as genuine human beings.Solondz brings out nothing but the best from his diverse cast. Dylan Baker tackles the most difficult role, but also the most contradictory one. On the surface, he is a loving family man and a successful doctor, but he's also a closet pedophile--whose next victim is destined to be his son's friend. It would be easy for us to condemn him as a monster, but he allows us to see the humanity in his character. Despite his fatal flaws, he is still a complete human being; not an evil person, but certainly a deeply troubled one. He does the unthinkable, compelling us to root for his character to escape discovery. I freely admit this is troubling--no one with a conscience would not be bothered--but this successfully demonstrates what can be done with a talented performer and director. Likewise, Jane Adams and Philip Seymour Hoffmann are dead-on as lonely, unhappy individuals. Some movies might see them as targets as ridicule, but Happiness shows that such a pathetic existence is no laughing matter (although there is a bit of humor every now and then).Admittedly, the director isn't much of a visual stylist, but that doesn't have a significance effect on the film. He is excellent with his actors, and his screenplay and sure-handed direction guide us through multiple plot threads without ever losing the audience. The only thing that doesn't quite work is the subplot with Louise Lasser as the elderly housewife with marital troubles. Lasser turns in a solid performance, but her story seems more like an afterthought to the main trio. Still, it's a worthwhile effort overall. It's a film deserving of a second chance.*** (out of ****)Released by Good Machine International",

I'd also like to point out that we seem to be led to almost sympathize with the creep. I felt very sad for his son and the boys who were victims more than anyone, least of all the perpetrator. Almost everyones behavior was sick to some degree, going all the way from extreme phoniness and arrogance to murder. I walked away from this film wondering how many people in real life are hiding something emotionally gory about themselves and I also walked away a little more disillusioned with the world we now live in.

This is the kind of film that's well directed and acted enough to resemble art but depraved and disgusting enough to appeal to the voyeur in us, so we can excuse ourselves for sitting through it. The artistic elements did not outweigh the negatives, as you shall see in the following paragraph.The situations in the film were just not funny, and thus in no sense can this be called a  comedy. Pedophilia is especially not very humorous. There were scenes that I found to be quite gripping between a pedophiliac father and his son but they belong in a much better film, not in a film that turns everything into a joke with an ending that made me mad. Everything here deserves a better ending, perhaps a more tragic ending, but at least a conclusion that wraps everything up in a way befitting a drama and less befitting a Jim Carrey comedy.There also just isn't much substance here. Characters make obscene phone calls. They have sick fantasies.  They hurt others and themselves. The lesson that  loneliness and desperation breed perversion is  hammered into our heads with one shock after  another. We learn that seemingly banal and normal families have skeletons. We learn that a child masturbating is funny. We learn all of  his and more, but what is the point? Don't waste your time here trying to find one. It's all  shock and no substance. The material is better handled in \"American Beauty\", a more mainstream  and also flawed but far superior film.If \"American Beauty\" is rented out or something, or there is nothing else on cable, watch this. You won't be bored but you certainly will not be enlightened.On another note, I very strongly recommend the director's prior film, \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\" which is quite easily one of the greatest and most perceptive movies about  teenagers.",

However, there is no way Solondz's film would ever win Oscars. In this film a kind husband and loving father drugs and rapes his pre-teen son's pre-teen school friends, a lonely woman kills the elderly janitor who rapes her and dismembers his body and a lonely bachelor masturbates while making obscene phone calls. \"Happiness\" is anything but conventional in it's study of dysfunctional America. What makes the film so funny and so shocking is the empathy Solondz displays towards his characters; the more appalling their behaviour they more sympathetically are they portrayed. The child rapist is a case in point. Solondz never shys away from the enormity of the man's crimes nor does he seek to excuse them, but neither does he present us with a monster. In Dylan Baker's stunning performance we see beyond the character's self-confessed sickness and can identify with and understand the basic, simplistic kindness of the man. The film is not an apology for child abuse but a matter-of-fact, almost clinical, observation of an everyday child abuser.Then there is Philip Seymour Hoffman's obscene phone-caller whose sad, masturbatory existence is blown apart when he finally hits the jackpot and calls the woman of this dreams from across the hall and awakens in her the need for a fantasy rape. (She's a poet who writes about being abused in her childhood when. of course, she never was). The same poet is one of three sisters, (another is married to the child rapist), and it is they, and their relationship, that make up the fundamental backbone of the movie.All the performances are magnificent, though it is Hoffman and Baker, by the very nature of their characters, that tend to overshadow those around them. And naturally any film that deals so frankly with the subject of paedophilia and ends when an 11 year old boy jerking off finally 'comes' is bound to be controversial but what makes it essential viewing and the masterpiece I genuinely believe it to be is Solondz's heartfelt belief in the frailty and decency of all of his characters and his desire to get to the bottom of what it is that makes all of us the way we are.",

Showing the moral consequences of the psychiatrist's sexual escapades would have reduced this wonderful film to the level of propaganda. Cinema or any other art form is not responsible for raising children to be simple minded law- abiding citizens. Instead, art should teach us to look outside our own social indoctrination, and see things in a way not complimentary to our own view points. Showing the balefulness of film characters is a nasty habit which fills popular culture movies (for example, The Green Mile, the Gladiator, etc.).As to the film itself, I think it is absolutely hilarious. And humor always stems from truth. In that sense, this film is a caricature of middle class life and all of its hidden perversions. And despite those perversions, Solondz always creates empathizable characters. It may shock some people to find themselves empathizing with a child rapist, but I find it even more perverse to brand such people as \"monsters,\" and not as people. It is pompously and revoltingly moral.Bravo to Solondz for creating a wise and brilliant fugue of modern misery.",

I had thought that he had the delicate balance of humor and tragedy after seeing Welcome to the Dollhouse.  I was wrong.  This experiment in suffering only goes to show that Solondz is a one-trick pony, and his trick is to make his audience uncomfortable.  Every character in Happiness is laced with a cliched and sinister sexual repression which turns the women into frigid and pathetic dolls and the men into sexual predators. We are asked to sympathize with a serial pedophile and rapist who drugs his son's friends before he rapes them.  We are asked to feel for the doormat kid sister who has the world turn against her throughout the movie.   What's worse is that Solondz has an arsenal of talent that he squanders.  Camryn Manheim is a fabulous actress: why cast her as \"generic fat person\"?  Philip Seymour Hoffman can do so much more than just ejaculate on a wall and look creepy.  Solondz barely took advantage of the actors he had, and was left with a shoddy story.There are two things that make a story successful.  One is how you tell it, and Solondz did an average job at that.  The other, which is probably the most important, is to have a story worth telling.  Otherwise, it doesn't matter how good the sound is and how much film you shoot on.  If the story is terrible, there is no hope for the movie.",

And who could forget the disturbed neighbors and family members which are part of their lives. Joy, played by Jane Adams, has bad luck with relationships. When she tries to politely exit a relationship with her dorky boyfriend, Andy (John Lovits); He commits suicide. She feels guilty and leaves her job as a telemarketer to teach immigrants English. Things get worse for Joy, as literally everyone dumps on her the entire movie. Poor Joy, I know the feeling! Then their is Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle), the successful sister. She's an unhappy author who has regular one night stands. She fantasizes about being raped by an obscene prank phone caller(Phillip Seymore Hoffman). Hoffman gives an outstanding performance as a lonely man with kinky fantasies. This leads him to dial random numbers, talking dirty in order to get off. The last sister Trish (Cynthia Stevenson) is an annoying conservative housewife who thinks she has it all. She has two kids, a beautiful home and a psychiatrist husband. Little does she know of her husbands problem with pedophilia. The subject matter is dark, but at the same time very funny. Todd Solondz is a director who creates an atmosphere of uneasy laughter. You'll tell yourself not to laugh, but you just can't help it. \"Happiness\" is psycho-sexual like \"Blue Velvet\" and has lonely alienated characters like in \"Magnolia\". Todd Solondz makes viewers cringe and laugh with his harsh realism. Clearly the MPAA doesn't like realism in cinema. The film received an NC-17 rating for its tone. But the MPAA seems to love handing out R-Ratings for stylized gore and CGI violence and sophomoric bodily humor. But realistic subject matter gets an NC-17. Why?

It's just that he didn't know where to stop. Mostly his relationships in this film are great, going in surprising directions and ultimately very telling about the type of person he's trying to create.But honestly, did we even need any of the side-story about the parents? Every time we got back to them I got the distinct feeling that this was five, ten, fifteen minutes I'd be not watching other, better, more interesting characters develop. Also, the fat lady neighbor; ultimately, her story came out in the end and became worth it, but it was the most predictable and least tightly defined of all the characters.I think Todd Solontz got a little into \"big cast\" syndrome (without actually having a hugely recognizable cast, save Hoffman and Boyle) to express as much widespread loneliness as possible, but didn't think about how much that may weigh down the otherwise biting and in-your-face social commentary.It was a great movie, but it could have been even better.--PolarisDiB",

On the other hand it shows us real people with real emotions and real thoughts. Yes, the thoughts and the way the characters handle to them are often wrong but you do understand them in the end you do not only feel hatred but a little sympathy as well. One of the characters is Bill (Dylan Baker), a child molester, who is married to Trish (Cynthia Stevenson). We see him as a very normal guy, although a pedophile, and she seems to be the happiest person in the world. She seems that, but in \u0091Happiness' there are no happy people. Trish has two sisters. The miserable Joy (Jane Adams) who just had a break-up with Andy (Jon Lovitz), a guy from her work that no one even knew, and Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle) who thinks every man wants to sleep with her. That does count for her neighbor Allen (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who is deeply in love with her. He explains this to his shrink, Bill the child molester. Allen calls women to talk dirty to them and one day he calls Helen. She likes what she hears and she answers him. Another woman from their building Kristina (Camryn Manheim) likes Allen and tries to make contact. The last story is about the parents of Trish, Joy and Helen who are about to separate.A lot of stories combines, a lot of unhappiness. Like I said, you probably will not want to see this. There are scenes very hard to watch especially when they involve Bill and a kid. We don't see the times he is molesting a child but the scenes that lead up to the terrible events are very painful. The final scene between Bill and his oldest son is close to devastating. Still, every single story is at least interesting probably because it involves normal people. One of the characters could be your friend or neighbor and realizing that makes this movie better and interesting to watch. It is unlike most movies where people who do bad things are only that. Here they have emotions and you are able to understand, just a little, why they do the things they do.By the way, this really is a comedy. Although things are painful we can laugh at most of the things we see. Don't think it is inappropriate to make a comedy about this subject. The way it is handled is terrific.",

But it was so human and so funny. But human first. We have, or at least I, have come to expect now, nothing but Superhero movies from Hollywood. (I use that word as a catchall, sorry).I like superhero's, loved Batman Begins, but such rather removes one from the human condition. The last film that brought our condition back to me was 'The Hours.', but that by comparison to this sinks like an old Disney feel good. All the actors are billiento. The talks between father and son are the most honest that I have seen - never experienced - but also I have never seen on film either. Unfortunately my tape run out so I only got up to the point where the kid was being interviewed by the cops about his forgotten rape. Then the bloody tape ran out. But I had got Donny Darko before that. Also a good movie, but also again nothing compared to this piece of fine work.Yet, I have to admit that the best moment for me was when the hysterical woman walked in and spat at the skinny girl. Who the 'f**k' was she!!! I know because I have looked at the cast listing. Her name is Hope Pomerance. Is that some name or is it some name! This is a great film, a rare one that should be shown to everyone.But, Hope - what a woman! You know when you first see someone - BANG! And the movie? BANG! too.",

            "content": "One of the most original American films in years, Todd Solondz directs Happiness with aplomb for subject matter that audiences and filmmakers alike often reject. Only Neil LaBute, David Lynch, and Terry Zwigoff come immediately to mind as directors not only willing to take on such material but present it in non-exploitative fashion. The film is about an older, bickering couple who have fallen out of love and their three daughters' lives. However, the film focuses primarily on their sexual hang-ups and their inabilities to function in relationships in general. In doing so, writer/director Todd Solondz creates a portrait of very dysfunctional and depraved individuals who are at once hilarious, interesting, pathetic, and sad but above all human.The ensemble cast is flawless throughout the film. Louise Lasser is perfect as the insecure, nagging bitch of a wife from whom Ben Gazzara wants to flee. When he does get away briefly with Elizabeth Ashley, he has the funniest scene in the film, romping with Ashley in heat and suddenly declaring he doesn't feel anything. The ambiguity of the scene is not lost on the viewer. Human beings who have lost the ability (or never had it) to connect with others emotionally and intellectually feel nothing either.The three sisters are as different as the three actresses that play them. Cynthia Stevenson is married to pedophile Dylan Baker, only she doesn't know about it yet. She presents herself as the smugly superior sister who \"has it all\" only she doesn't realize her whole life is about to crumble. Unfortunately, she is the only character the film does not expose like the others. Dylan Baker, as her husband, fights a losing battle with pedophilia, and his hopelessly misguided son obsesses about masturbation.Lara Flynn Boyle is also well cast as the self-centered, cruel, emotionally dead sister who craves any sexual excitement crossing her path. Watch her interact with and comment about both sisters (Stevenson and Jane Adams) and her self-centeredness and cruelty are readily apparent. Her scenes with Philip Seymour Hoffman, a neighbor, are equally funny and pitiful. Hoffman plays a sexually frustrated obscene phone caller who can not bring himself to approach women in person. Boyle frustrates him as he frustrates her inadvertently. Camryn Manheim enters the picture as an even more sexually whacked out neighbor than Hoffman.The film begins with the third sister, played by Jane Adams, meeting her latest loser boyfriend, Jon Lovitz, in a restaurant, when a break up occurs. When Lovitz sees through her insincerity and lack of empathy, he chastises her openly. Adams subsequently and spontaneously gets involved with a Russian immigrant who is a thief (Jared Harris). Adams is emotionally and physically abused throughout the film. She's a poster child for people who do not have a clue about their own lives and why things are going the way they are.Solondz does not act condescending or judge individuals but merely demonstrates that happiness is relative and temporal. Many scenes are difficult and painful to watch. Those viewers obsessed with judging others or their sexual proclivities will want to avoid this film. Those viewers who like challenging, thought-provoking material may still find the film hard-going but ultimately entertaining, interesting, and rewarding. It's a melange of human alienation, depravity, desperation, and self-absorption riding on an interpersonal carousel to nowhere. It's definitely not a date movie, and the title is most ironic. ***1/2 of 4 stars.",

Mr. Solendz should not be condemned for addressing the deeply disturbing subjects he does in this movie. If the subject matter troubles you, don't go. Happiness doesn't pretend to be Disney or Meg Ryan fare, and boy, it sure isn't. If the subject is not a showstopper, Happiness will treat you to some of the best ensemble acting found in a movie in 1998.  Happiness is a series of small inter-related stories and the acting is superb. There is no \"leading\" role carrying the film, it is a group effort, and it is top-notch. But Happiness still has some problems. The plot, an emotionally heavy affair, seems overburdened with too many dysfunctions.  Had Solendz cut back on the number of sub-plots and delved into the remaining ones a little deeper, I believe it would have improved the film. With so many depravities crammed into the lives of the three sisters they become unbelievable. While watching the movie one thinks...\"what next?\"...and by golly, something even worse happens. My only other criticism is the gratuitous \"shock\" scenes that seem inserted just to gross out the audience.  Instead of heightening it, they distract from the emotional impact of the drama...remember, this is not a Farrely brothers movie.  It's still leading edge and very well done, but I'm afraid Mr. Solendz passed by his opportunity for a landmark movie.",

They all seem to cross paths like in an Altman movie but this time around they're not big name stars but actors who amazingly fit the mould of the characters they portray.

            "content": "There have been few films which I've really felt the need to write about afterwards. This is certainly one of them.I'm not uptight, nor do I feel that a film necessarily has to be upbeat or enlightening -- and this film is certainly neither. But there is something about this film which is extremely unsettling, and not just for its supremely dark subject-matter. On the other hand, a day after watching it for the first time, I cannot stop thinking about it. Perhaps that is the reason why I am so troubled by this film: it is infectious, and the virus it carries is one of unabated bleakness and hopelessness.At this point, it's hard to imagine that there's anyone who still believes that suburbia is full of wholesomeness and well-adjusted people. The premise -- that the image of happiness is merely a veneer which hides a dark and desperate inner life -- is just not fresh enough to carry a whole movie. But it's not even a question of whether the premise can carry the movie. In spite of what some other reviewers have said, this is most certainly not a boring film. And it does stick with you like very little else I have seen, so there is definitely some power here which doesn't exist in similar, inferior, films like _Magnolia_.But I guess what bugs me about this film is that it seems to rely on the principal failing of postmodern thought -- that it is merely enough to point out the sheer arbitrariness and duplicitousness of contemporary existence and the values we extol. In a way, the \"exposing\" of this arbitrariness and duplicitiousness creates an even bigger problem than the problem it exposes. Life is bleak, life is meaningless. I get it. The question is not whether this is true; the question is what can be done about it. How does a film which thrives on bleakness and conveys only bleakness and ends in bleakness and exists only to paint a picture of absolute bleakness accomplish anything at all? Social satire's primary purpose is to do something in the social realm -- does this film accomplish anything except to depress its viewers? It certainly didn't for me.On a lesser note, but still noteworthy -- the gross-out stuff seems totally out of place (even given the film's subject matter) and really detracts from what it does do well. Five minutes worth of material being edited out certainly wouldn't make the film any more hopeful, but it would make it stronger for what it does do.",

It is a sensationalistic bottom dweller, so smug and self-confident as it fires point-blank salvo after salvo at the broadest barnside in the world: The American Dream. Solondz manages to create his own special brand of irony that is entirely devoid of subtlety or wit. All he's left with is meanness, a meanness that doesn't connect to life in any constructive or thoughtful way. But the thing that truly makes this film unwatchable is the pace. Each scene is played out just like the next, as disappointments and bad decisions and empty pronouncements all build to an incredibly predictable conclusion where each character resorts to internalizing their psychoses and remains right where they were at the beginning. There is no intriguing dramatic progress in any of the storylines or insight given into these pseudo-characters, all because of Solondz' refusal to let any light or sensitivity into their world.",

Yes, it has some controversial things going on, but it's also somehow warm drama, about troubled characters who try to find happiness. After watching three Solondz films I can see it's his definitive style here.Maybe I was disappointed a little bit because based on the hype I expected even more gross-out shocking material, but it wasn't that much worse than the two other films I've seen from the director before. Also the focus on multiple characters made the film a bit...non-focused. Maybe it's just a matter of taste that I like a more linear apporach or something.Not my super favorite, but quite an interesting film, especially if you like dark comedy and dramas with weird characters.",

I'm not sure whether to give this one star or ten, I don't know if its good are bad. In hindsight i'm probably leaning towards the latter.Its one of those multi-plot films that switches between different stories think Pulp Fiction(although quite different). I'm not really sure what the film is exactly trying to say if anything all, as there is so many issues at hand. Its almost like a series of short stories bundeled together with the fact that its 3 sisters and their lives its centred around just seems like a convenience. Doomed relationships, broken dreams, Paedophilia, adolescence, family/sibling relationships, frustration, desperation, sexual frustration, murder, Rape, emptiness & loneliness are just some of the themes dealt with here but little in the way of happiness.Its hard to descibe the film, you just need to watch it really to make up your own mind. Some of the acting is fabulous. Philip seymour Hoffman & Dylan Baker are standout in awkward roles. There is a lot of explicit & objectionable materiel to make one squirm some of which i found pretty needless. Not that I'm easily offended,but when you see someone masturbating you kinda get the picture you don't need to see the semen dripping down the wall just as an example. The Paedophilc father having a somewhat ridiculously ''honest'' conversation with his 11 year old son after he's been arreseted and released on bail?? Its just a tad surreal like much of this film.

It's sick, shocking, funny, sad, inspiring, provocative, controversial, evocative, disgusting, the list goes on, but like the emotions listed above, most are negative, some touching places you don't won't to go. There's so many things we can relate with, whether puberty, disappointment, denial, rage, anger and we have a brilliant cast of a actors to demonstrate these feelings and emotions, the first one to spring to mind, is Philip Seymour Hoffman, an amazing actor, who's dull, apathetic voice fits his flawed, semi psychotic, lonely shell of a man, who stalks women by telephone, using smutty messages, and I'm not even gonna tell ya what he does with postcards. This is just one character. Most of them have issues, but with the rest, whose lives may seem picture perfect, they too aren't content. But what is Happiness anyhow. Is there such a thing? Basically this 140 minute movie I love, that never seems like 140 minutes, is set around the lives of three sisters, and people they associate with, whether family, new loves, stalkers, other sick puppies, dumped ugly guys, etc. The only person who's really all together, until a shocking revelation throws her world into a hundred and eighty degree spin, is the oldest of the sisters. Life's pretty peachy creamy for the second oldest too, but fame can come at a price, while the youngest, a lonely budding singer/guitarist, in need of you know what... is quite a mess. While watching this movie it'll jangle some nerves, touch upon sensitive spots, in scenes that are all too real, some may be too real, where we keep relating with more of them as the movie progresses. It's as if reality keeps kicking back at us, like a drug. That's it's genius. One scene reminiscent of Port Arthur, and thank god this was just an imaginary scene, has disturbed psychiatrist (Dylan Baker), strolling through central park, gunning down people at random, with an A-47, where at the end of it all, he seems totally disaffected. Like this scene, a couple of other scenes go a bit too far, some of them involving pedophilia, but these recurring issues, we can't turn blinders too. Happiness is a sheer 1999 masterpiece, and deserves it's place among that year's top ten films. Though it's not for all tastes, or may'be even more accurately put, it may just be for acquired tastes, this movie will leave you shocked, sickened, where you may even feel the need to vomit, OR you may just find it inspirational and that itself is rewarding. I know the latter is a hard concept to grasp, but you have to read between the lines, and realize that out there in the big lonely world, there's always gonna be someone, who's far worse off than you.",

            "content": "During my life I've seen a lot of pretty messed up movies. I actually enjoy controversial pictures because they open my eyes and perspective about life to things I'd normally steer clear of. Well, out of the thousands of films I've viewed over the thirteen years I've been watching them (I'm fifteen) I don't remember seeing a movie more messed up, provocative and twisted then Todd Solondz's 'Happiness'. 'Happiness' is Solondz's second full-length feature (the first being the 1996 indie cult favorite 'Welcome to the Dollhouse'), and it puts a whole new spin on the 'Leave it to Beaver'-like suburban house life. This is one messed up feature film, and you know what, I absolutely loved it!It follows the Jordans, a family so screwed up it makes the Mansons look like the Bradys. The dysfunction begins with Joy Jordan (Jane Adams), a lonely and neurotic telemarketer who can never find a man. After she breaks up with Andy (SNL's Jon Lovitz), and he kills himself, she decides to teach at a DMV while it's going through a worker's union strike, and falls in love with a crazy Russian, Vlad (Jared Harris), only to find out he's married. The second of the Jordan children is Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle). She's a controversial novelist who writes about issues such as violent rape and child molestation, and is a sex addict. She's neighbors with a fat, lonely computer nerd, Allen (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who randomly selects women out of the New Jersey area phone book at attempts to have phone sex with them, and, a sad, obese woman, Kristina (Camryn Manheim), with a deadly secret. The third Jordan child is Trish (Cynthia Stevensen), the typical nosy, loud-mouthed and hypocritical suburban housewife, whose husband, Bill Maplewood (Dylan Baker), is a psychiatrist, whose also a homosexual pedophile who dreams of mass suicide in public parks and falls in love with his 11-year-old son, Billy's (Rufus Read), best friend. Billy is also having a certain problem almost every teenage boy comes across, and who better to talk and help him through it then his father, a pedophilia maniac. Then comes the Jordan's parents, Mona (Louise Lasser) and Lenny (Ben Gazzara). Lenny tells Mona he wants to split up because he isn't in love with her anymore, and seeks love from a Joan Rivers like senior citizen, Diane Freed (Elizabeth Ashley). Mona has a hard time dealing with this and almost looses her mind. How's that for a f*cked up family!!!'Happiness' is almost too screwed up for words. It takes all these disgusting and hard to stomach situations, and puts a comical twist on them. Only Todd Solondz has the cajones to do this, and I salute him for it. The main attraction of course in 'Happiness' is the writing. The screenplay was the best of that year, and I am absolutely appalled it didn't win any awards. It's very intricate, bold, daring and it contains some of the most original and down-right frightening conversations between characters that you will ever see. The acting is astounding too. Dylan Baker gives perhaps the best performance of the film as the manic pedophile/ psychiatrist. Baker proves himself an actor in leagues of performers such as Brando, Pacino, and Nicholson. Philip Seymour Hoffman is amazing as to be expected as the dirty prank caller/hopeless nerd, and Jane Adams reels you into her character's misery, which is not an easy thing for any actor to do. Ben Gazzara and Louise Lasser are extremely solid in their roles, and Camryn Manheim is funny if not strange in her role. Lara Flynn Boyle amuses as Helen Jordan, author of 'Pornographic Childhood', while Cynthia Stevensen really makes you believe she's a you know what (it starts with a B and ends with a H). Jared Harris and Jon Lovitz are good in their limited screen time, but Elizabeth Ashley kind of freaked me out (maybe just her character, though.) I didn't think too much of newcomer Rufus Read during the course of the film, but that ending scene with him and his pedophile dad was when I realized what a brilliant young actor this kid is. The directing was okay, but I never really thought Solondz was nearly a good director as he was writer. Some of it seems kind of amateurish in a way, but that's not to stop you from enjoying this sick treat of a movie.As far as viewing this film is concerned, I'd say it isn't for everyone. My mother thought it was a revolting piece of garbage and my soon-to-be brother-in-law thought it was brilliant. If you have no problem with the above issues being played out in this film, I'd say you are fine to watch it. If the above issues really get to you, I'd say rent something like 'Elf' with Will Ferrell instead. 'Happiness' isn't for everyone, but it was good enough for me. One of the best films of 1998.

            "content": "Happiness...yes, you'll feel SO happy after you see this movie, if vinegar tastes like sugar to you. The director was doing the Shakespeare thing, obviously:  Human beings simply cannot stand unmitigated, unrelieved tragedy and therefore, the comedic moment was invented.  This kept people in their seats and the playwright employed.For sheer ALONENESS, both visual and psychological, this one can't be beat. I have NEVER seen so many alienated, intelligent, desperately unhappy people of comfortable income and decent education in one movie.Why did I know the parents lived in Florida immediately?  Of course, the pastels that exist nowhere else but in their state-ordained ubiquitous interior decorating scheme.  Was it truly Elisabeth Husky-voice of \"Ship of Fools\"?....from ingenue to wreck, thus go we all.  How courageous of her, and what a great job she did!Ben Gazzara's \"I feel nothing\" after his wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am non-Viagra assisted episode on the couch ---right on.  What a great actor....doing nothing, playing nothing and so exquisitely!!!  Ennui...thy name is Ben.  No one has any money problems, and that's probably one of the problems.Somehow, the pedophile father, stalking through his dreams with the machine gun blazing, could not have done more harm.  And the stick-thin sisters, obviously intelligent but SOOOOO ditzy.  One look at the overweight jilted mom wailing, \"And I've got to have another face-lift\" told you why. \nI would say that if you take comfort and delight in the misery of others, as the pedophile's wife did (and don't we love her comeuppance?!!!!), this is for you.  Come to think of it, I liked her pederast husband much better than I did her.  Sure, he ruined those boys, including his son, for life, but man, she was pure venom to everyone she touched.   At least, you could identify the harm HE did.  It was almost touching watching him trying to get the innocent victim to eat/drink the sleeping-potion-laced food.  Such a pleading look he had.  And then, his answers to the interrogation by his son, sitting side by side on the comfortable sofa: looking like a Ozzie and Harriet father/son talk.  His thoughtful, sad-faced answers: \"Yes, I did rape those boys.  Yes, I did enjoy it. Yes, I would do it again.  No, I would not do it to you...I would just jack off.\"This is so truthful: psychologists tell us pederasts are the least susceptible to rehabilitation.  Jail is no deterrent, but they must simply be locked up forever until we find the physiological cause and detonate it. Chemicals only work as long as they take them.  Analagous to expecting the crazy homeless to take their medication.  Sure!!!  The very organ that is damaged is the one expected to 'do the right thing'.The killer fatso woman is funny, so funny, as she graphically describes the murder while eating : \"Oh, I'll just have the chocolate fudge sundae with strawberry ice cream on top.\"  You FEEL her revulsion toward having anything INSIDE her (paradox itself), which is why she offed him, as love-starved as she was.To watch all these characters searching for love in all the wrong places, and then rejecting it when it came for all sorts of reasons is the agonizing strain of this movie.  Just a tiny bit of dramatic license to make the point about the lives most of in the prosperous 90's live.Do NOT see \"Fight Club\", \"American Beauty\" and \"Happiness\" in sequence or you'll off yourself!!!  Or better still, show all three to your Sunday School class.  It might give the kids a hint of 'why ethics? why integrity? why faithfulness?' in a better dose than all the hellfire and brimstone I got as a kid.  We make our own Hells, after all.",

            "content": "Lovely little film! Thank you so much, Todd. I wish I'd had the chance to speak with you last night after the film instead of before. I would have loved to have told you exactly what I thought of it -- and you!I first watched \"Happiness\" -- or tried to -- several years ago on DVD. Ordinarily, I never see a theatrical film on the small screen for the first time. But I was so impressed with \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\" I decided to break my own rule. \"Dollhouse\" may be the funniest yet cruelest film ever made about the hell of junior high. (I originally avoided \"Happiness\" at the theater because it sounded depressing and ridiculously bleak. Who needs that kind of misery? But a few years later I decided to give it a try, though -- thinking: hey, what does the L.A. Times know anyway, right?As it turned out -- plenty! My initial instincts and fears were proved right. Black comedy? Maybe if you're a sadomasochist. Not only was it overlong, exploitative and gratuitous -- it was so self-indulgent we learn infinitely more about the filmmaker than the characters. Alternately bored and revolted, I gave up about halfway through.I decided to give the film one final try last night when it was shown properly, on the big screen.The proper format didn't help.Because of the upcoming release of Solondz's new film, \"Palindromes,\" the American Cinematheque at the Aero screened both \"Dollhouse\" and \"Happiness,\" with Solondz answering questions between films.\"Dollhouse\" was almost as good as I remembered: funny and real and ferociously unsentimental. Somehow the balance works just right. Heather Matarazzo and the other teen actors are so strong and believable they counteract the overacting adults, such as the mother -- so over the-top and dead-set against Dawn she nearly ruins the picture. Afterwards, Solondz answered questions about his films and career. I almost felt a little sorry for him when the largely high school-age audience began snickering -- apparently chuckling at his Truman Capote-like voice and stammering, almost painful delivery. Like his films, when Solondz speaks you don't know whether he wants you to laugh -- or cry!In retrospect, the debacle of \"Happiness\" points up defects in \"Dollhouse.\" A lot can be traced to Dawn's insanely over-the-top, monstrous mother (mirrored by the equally overacting wife of the pedophile in \"Happiness.\") These characters, plus the nerdy brother and constantly-worshiped little sister, evidently put Solondz's life experiences in view -- and they are painful indeed.But in \"Happiness,\" he simply goes too far. Like a child given free reign over the blackboard after school, he scrawls as many dirty words as possible, no matter how offensive or pointless. Worst of all, his screenplay takes a number of shocking incidents and offensive characters and stirs them into a reprehensible mish-mosh. And like the child endlessly pushing his limits, Solondz finally destroys what he has created by going too far -- with ridiculously over-the-top Farrelly Brothers-style gross-out humor. These scenes completely negate whatever drama his cast has created. Both the pedophile, played by Dylan Baker, and Rufus Read, portraying his son, certainly dig deeper into their souls than probably anyone ever thought possible. Both are extremely powerful. But I wonder how embarrassed they are when someone recognizes them on the street! Is this the way an actor should go through life?!Apparently because of traumas he suffered growing up, Solondz has come to despise humanity. He has chosen to distance himself from (if not despise) his characters, even the ones we want to like. He dumps cruelty upon misfortune upon humiliation onto them. Retribution? It seems likely.But ultimately, this sort of cruelty makes him look like the bully, not the victim. The only real sympathy he creates is for his poor actors.One of the best things about \"Dollhouse\" was its ending, showing Dawn triumphing in spite of adverse circumstances. We grow to love her, and are happy to see her persevere.But we love NONE of the people in \"Happiness\" -- not any more than laboratory rats sequestered in a cage and force-fed poison. Beginning with the first scene, the movie feels like either a contrived, shock-for-the-sake-of-shock soap opera -- where no one behaves realistically -- or some kind of insane, sociological experiment where each miserable subject is alternately tortured and taunted for no apparent benefit. And as opposed to an Altman film, which this somewhat resembles, we are almost always aware we are watching actors on a set, saying things merely because the director and script dares them to.The chipper wife, for example, photographed with a wide angle lens for maximum distortion, seems to have stepped out of a detergent commercial. An experienced director would have brought out something real, something human, grounding her somehow to planet Earth. But Solondz seems to favor exaggerated, caricaturish grotesqueness over reality. Like Neil LaBute, he may have been better off working in theater.In my view, Solondz is the one who needs the shrink, not Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Gay or straight, pedophile or no, Solondz obviously has serious issues -- and I suppose film-making serves as therapy. (This film alone could have fueled about twenty years of in-depth analysis.)\"I'm not laughing at you, I'm laughing with you,\" Lara Flynn Boyle says at one point. This is the crux of the whole problem. Solondz NEVER laughs with his characters -- ALWAYS at them. Ben Gazzara says to his wife, \"I feel nothing.\" Another telling moment. But sometimes Solondz does feel something for his characters: hatred.And worse, like the people at the Aero last night, he snickers and mocks them, probably with the same cruelty once harbored by those who taunted him all those years ago.",

            "content": "'Happiness' - an all time low in scraping the barrel. Stunning in it's complete lack of morals taste or decency. Amazing considering it starred the likes of Philip Seymour Hoffmann and Lara Flynn Boyle. In fairness their acting was quite incredible considering the subject matter involved. An unnecessary movie - a complete and utter waste of time for everyone involved including us viewers. Of course the critics loved it (back in 1998) or thereabouts I think but I am glad to say the sicko style of director / writer Todd Solondz has been given precious little opportunity for his weird tastes to hit the screen since. An extremely rare occasion for me to say I will be returning this to the 2nd hand shop I bought it in as I would not allow it to remain in my collection. Plot Spoilers follow - ( I apologise for using the word plot as it's really a false description considering there is no plot to speak of) do yourself a favour read them so you can avoid the mistake I made!!Everything but 'Happiness'! Some of the 'lowlights' include - relationship break ups leading to suicide kids being 'unrepentantly' molested and worse very graphic conversations between adults and kids - I know it's a movie script - doesn't make it OK!! an exploitative author who wishes she was raped so she could write about it obscene phone calls to random women and neighbours e.g. above mentioned writer someone is murdered and body disposed of little bits of a time in plastic bagsAll the while the characters are either loudly proclaiming they are blissfully content or totally useless. While early on in the film there were some 'darkly comic' moments (which is why I watched it to a conclusion) overall it was one of the worst movies I have ever had the displeasure to watch. Thankfully I am not alone in this view as per multiple reviews on here already.",

The story is done in a form of vignettes, so each story is interwined as well as the characters. So, you ask, \"where does the nastiness come in?\" Well, for one thing, one of the sisters has a husband who's also a flamboyant pedophile, and another sister is a writer who is consistently pestered by an obscene phone caller (Which is actually her apartment neighbor.) That's not even the half of it; just hear 30 seconds of the dialogue and you'll know that you're watching a strange movie.

It was all I'd ever dreamed and more.This is a character-driven black comedy with its singularly climacteric motif being that of sex (although it rarely shows the act on screen - the film mostly relies on dialogue to accomplish its business). Specifically, its ensemble of plots as well as the development of every main character all symbolize sexual climax.But it doesn't end there. Climax is, in turn, a synecdoche for the eponymous happiness itself. This film's vision of happiness is something that is difficult to find, difficult to catch once found, and impossible to hold on to for long even if caught. Moreover, it is unique to every individual.Every character becomes brutally acquainted with the nature of happiness. Some get close to their ultimate bliss - so close they can almost touch it - then fall just a hair's breadth short of it. Most characters do manage to achieve it but suffer a quick and spectacular downfall after doing so.The dialogue is hilarious throughout and the actors deserve special praise for their ability to carry out this script that relies mainly on deadpan humour.As for the plots tied to each character, they are never predictable, but after the fact you can see how each event fits neatly with each of the characters' ultimate profile. Despite the fact that we think we know each character by the image they project upon seeing them, there's a well-developed psychological world just beneath the superficies.Well worth the wait.Note: The movie might be shocking to some because it pushes against the boundaries of late 20th century US sociosexual norms (which are still in effect).Honourable mentions: Harakiri (1962) - a movie about violence that also doesn't show much violence on screen but still manages to create the emotional effects of violence through dialogue and pacing.

            "content": "I saw this film quite some time ago when it was released in an almost \"hush hush\" sort of way at the theatres. It caused quite some controversy over the lashing it received from the Ratings administration that it was released with a \"NC-17\" in the U.S. and an \"R\" rating here in Australia which is reserved for ultra-violent films or highly erotic films.Either the theme of pedophilia or the ejaculation shots helped this film to obtain an \"R\" rating, but most cinemas would not show this movie. It is also not an easy film to obtain at the local video store as most chains are recognised as a \"family\" store and do not stock films with the above themes in them.Anyway, the follow up to \"Welcome To The Dollhouse\", Todd Solonz presents us with yet another hilarious insight to the U.S. lifestyle so many people are not willing to look at and understand. I'm not sure if Todd Solonz is gay or not (not that it matters!), but as a gay male myself, I picked up many campy themes and references to both \"Happiness\" and \"Welcome To The Dollhouse\" which probably makes both his works more hilarious than intended. For example, the names \"Dawn\" and \"Joy\" being his proteges for his films. They are both unattractive losers typecast in a Canadian bordertown who are totally blind to how much of a joke they are to the general society. SPOILER ALERT In \"Happiness\" we have Joy Jordan, a 30-something musician-wannabe who works as a telemarketer, lives at home with her parents, the youngest of three sisters and the main focus of the story. Along the way, we see Joy dating a co-worker who she tries to dump nicely but has the tables turned on her when he gives her a timely speech and takes back a gift that he had given to her at that precise moment. *SPOILER* He later committs suicide because of this incident but his mother gives Joy a rather hilarious phonecall about. It seems that poor Joy keeps dating losers as pathetic as herself as no one at work seems to remember who her date was after he does die. When Joy quits her job as a telemarketer, she enlists as a teacher at a citizenship and naturalization school where she is to teach English. Upon her arrival she discovers that the teachers are currently on strike. (Yet another camp moment where she has a head of lettuce hurled at the back of her head by the strikers - and another moment inside the building where a woman in the background cries, \"I'm a scab!\" to which her confider reassures her, \"You are not a scab! You are a strike-breaker!\") Upon hearing this, Joy is cursed upon entry to her classroom by her pupils as a \"scab\" and she corrects them by labelling herself as a \"strike breaker\". If that's not funny, then you tell me what is!In this class, she meets a Russian immigrant who sticks up for her rights to work as a \"strike breaker\" and he uses his charms to get her into bed. Needless to say once he does that, she discovers from other teachers where she works that they too have been receiving sex from him. A catfight erupts in the faculty room which will leave you on the floor splitting in two from laughter! She continues through the film playing this character who you can't help but pity along the way. Her sisters, one being a seemingly happy housewife who thinks she has the \"perfect marriage\", and the other being a well-to-do journalist who is happy being a bachelorette and really doesn't care about anyone but herself. In the apartment across from hers lives a male who is secretly obsessed with her and makes anonymous phone sex calls to her before hanging up after he has gotten his sexual pleasure out if it. Down the hallway from him lives an overweight woman who secretly obsesses over him and has a rather dark and disturbing side to her which I will not spoil. Joy's mother and father are on the brink of divorce, hilariously played by Mary Hartman's Louise Lasser. She is obsessed with thinking that her husband is going to leave her, knowing fully well he is having an affair. She even makes a visit to the real estate agent to pre-buy a house thinking ahead of the divorce! Among other characters is Joy's housewife-of-a-sister whose husband is a closet-pedophile who drugs and then molests his son's best friend during a sleep-over. His son is obsessed with discovering puberty and adolescent and his ability to ejaculate at his age.The closing lines of the film when Joy and her family are enjoying a dinner together just about sums up Joy's life.\"We're not laughing *AT* you Joy, we're laughing *WITH* you!\"\"But, I wasn't laughing.\"If this isn't comedy, then you tell me what is!",

            "content": "I never enjoyed watching this movie. I laughed a few times, but it was more because the situations the characters were in were so uncomfortable. Overall that is not necessarily a bad thing. The bad thing about the movie is that is filled with interesting characters that you tend to get invested into, but then you spend too much time aware from them while spending time with other characters. You would almost forget about a character and all of sudden they were back.I honestly enjoyed all of the acting especially Dylan Baker, Jane Adams, and Lara Flynn Boyle. So Dylan Baker managed to play a sympathetic pedophile, or as sympathetic as they can be. His conversations with his son were some of the most awkward, but somehow endearing. I loved Lara Flynn Boyle's character. She was just over the top enough that she seemed to fit in atmosphere created by Solondz. I think I have a crush on Jane Adams now. For me she was extremely relatable, but at the same time kind of frustrating as a character. You just wanted to shake her and yell at her to get her life together, but then hold her and try to make her happy (she probably would break my heart just like Lovitz character though).Overall the movie is probably filled with some terribly awkward moments that are funny but in an uncomfortable kind of way. The movie did not flow from one character's arc to another. I forgot about the characters as the movie went a long, which is even more frustrating because so many of the characters are interesting and I wanted to spend time with them. But being away from any given character for as long as you are makes it hard to invest in the characters in any meaningful way. It is an OK movie that I probably not recommend to anyone, except possibly for the overarching concept of happiness and what it means to different people and how some don't know what it means to themselves. That was interesting, but with such a terrible flow it made it hard to stay interested in anyone character's happiness.",

Happiness, despite its funny scenes, lacks this ankle-level current and hits you top-side with wave after wave of despondency and bleakness.

If you think that you can handle watching something that will challenge your lifestyle, make you look at it and wonder why, see this movie.Acting:  Wonderful.  I loved Jon Lovitz, and I loved the pedophile.  I don't know, but they really rang true to me.  They always say, He was a nice enough guy.  Joy was different, but she played her character well. Everybody else did wonderful as well, but these characters and the acting really stuck out in my mind.  Also the little boy seemed truly curious in a boyish way, but not really mature enough to handle it, which I can relate to.  He did not even seem to grasp what he was spewing out of his mouth.The movie: challenging.  I dare you to watch this movie.  It challenges you, and it will make you think.  No real story other than all of the characters would like to achieve happiness.  It challenges suburban life, and it challenges inner city life.  It will make you think twice before your next decision, whether it be little or small.People who say that this movie is ironic, and that it is sometimes funny and uncomfortable, I say that that is what it is supposed to be.  Life is uncomfortable.  To those who didn't know if they should be laughing or crying, I say laugh because my family has a saying, \"If I didn't laugh, I would be crying.\"----10",

Most people will likely be put off the film because of some of the subject matter - a shame, because in doing so they fail to realize a daring and disturbing plot, excellent acting, and genuinely fine direction.  Exactly how does a director make a pedophile into a \"sympathetic\" character?  Not very easily, especially since most people prefer to see such people as one-dimensional monsters.  By adding depth to such a heinous character, showing that people are more than their actions, however disgusting, Solondz shakes the very fabric of our \"happy\" society, exposing an underbelly that is not one-dimensional, but one which is frighteningly like our own.  It is only when our demons are fleshed out, made realistic, that we become uncomfortable with them, when they no longer maintain their safe, cartoonish/thrill-ride quality.  This film takes such huge risks, I can only hope that audiences, who have been spoon-fed such trite rubbish as \"Armageddon\" and The Phantom Menace\", can appreciate its dark genius.  Pacing becomes problematic at times, especially when the story follows the sister's parents.  Some of the imagery is quite disturbing, and the moovie will definitely not appeal to everyone.  And contrary to other \"reviews\", this film does not promote pedophilia, any more than sex education promotes teen sex.  This film challenges its audience in ways very few films can.  For those who believe that this moovie somehow represents \"the depths to which Hollywood has sunk\", the MooCow is here to say that this film is very anti-Hollywood.  Thought-provoking and gut-wrenching, MooCow says check this out this film, but for mature, open minds only, please. :=8)",

The story follows three sisters, and their respective relationships. Trish (played by Cynthia Stevens) is married to Bill Maplewood (Dylan Baker), in what seems like a happy marriage.  However, when Bill speaks to a psychiatrist (he himself is a therapist), we realize that there is a lot more going on under the skin.  In fact, this entire film is about discovering what's under the skin of many people, no matter how unhealthy.  If there was an ensemble acting award at the Oscars, it would have gone to this film.  There is no single bad performance throughout the entire cast, spearheaded by Dylan Baker, who should have received a supporting nod.  His performance is simply magnificent.  Many people will cringe at his final scene with his son, but Rufus Reed and Baker play it so well, that it doesn't feel exploitive or out of context  In answering his son's questions openly and honestly, he perhaps saves his son from any future pain.  Baker's character isn't a demon, but a man who isn't in control of his demons.  The three sisters are portrayed excellently, with Lara Flynn Boyle leading the pack.  Her performance as a poet who's sick of being admired rang very true, from her characters shallowness to her own understanding of how empty she is.     This film can not be described as titillating or exploitive. Though not everyone will like, it dares to tread where few go.  One of the best of 1998, Todd Solondz was sorely overlooked at the Oscars.",

            "content": "Happiness is a film that explores happiness in a way that takes a look into the darker side of the things we do as people - whether out of loneliness or uncontrolled desires, sometimes what gives us happiness seems crazy to others so we keep them inside so no one can ever know about it.And sometimes for good reason due to the consequences of our actions. The film deals with people who feel either depressed, tormented or lost in direction with their lives and many of them make the choices that they normally wouldn't do. You have the a struggling musician stuck in a sales call centre job with no real direction, an elderly couple who are on the brink of splitting up but don't want a divorce, a lonely middle aged guy who spends the majority of his time calling random women and jerking off to them and perhaps the most interesting, a middle aged family man psychiatrist who has the deepest secret of all (which I won't reveal here just not to spoil it).That being said, this is not a film for everyone in particular if you don't like subject matters of controversy, and in particular don't get young children to watch this as it is definitely not appropriate for them. However, the film is done in such a way that keeps you sympathetic to these characters and even though the majority of them you would normally associate such people in reality as lowlifes and no hopers, you can only imagine what their daily pain is like in life.The film switches its tone to comedy then to very dark moments. One scene in particular involving a father and son (people who have seen this will know which one) is probably one of the most psychologically shocking scenes which is just said verbally in my opinion. No gore or anything but at the same time it is so horrific and tragic in that one scene.The characters in this film really hold this film together all the way and you are interested in all of them, though I did feel the elderly couple's story was the weakest out of all of them, though still interesting.The film blends cleverly humour, sadness, tragedy and relationships altogether in one that makes you look at what happiness is for some people, even if you will never really understand it. Everyone's definition of it is different.I would recommend this film to all my friends but if you told them the subject matter some might be put off but I think this is definitely a film well worth your time if you like controversial movies that go the next step to explore tabbo subjects.",

            "content": "Challenging films are films, that when watched with an open mind, usually tend to impress me and make me feel entertained in a way perhaps you don't normally get from any other film. I admire films that aren't afraid to let their quirky-ness and originality stand out, and the films of Todd Solondz are no exception to this aspect. I love to the deepest descent that he manages perfectly too have the ability to present us with the most outrageous, shocking, and even in this case controversial situation, but at the same time gives us an extraordinary and moving piece that we can't forget whether we like it or not. So loving the films of Todd Solondz I came into \"Happiness\" hoping for the best, although if you've heard anything about the film it may be enough to scare you away, it almost did me.The thing that makes \"Happiness\" so outrageous and controversial is too many the pedophile aspect, but also perhaps how in the end we feel a strange sense of sympathy and even sorrow for a character like him, or an obscene phone caller, even for a dirty old man leaving his wife for younger women. \"Happiness\" doesn't glorify these ordeals, but instead in a very twisted sort of way kind of sort of turn them in to a joke, the kind where you don't know if it's okay to laugh, and if you do you feel even worse. \"Happiness\" manages to give us a devilishly indulging time that honestly some would do best to avoid. However I must say it's a film you don't really want to admit to yourself that you're enjoying so much, seeing how in certain scenes you can't help but feel pretty darn disturbed. The delicious diabolical humor is absolutely awesome; I like the feeling of that sort of uncomfortable humor they strongly use in this film.The film deals with the lives of three sisters, so in a way the film is three different stories. The first deals with Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle), whose neighbor is an obscene phone caller who says sexual slurs in the calls to express his lonely sexual desire and even repression. The film gives this character (played perfectly by Phillip Seymour Hoffman), an extremely fragile soul, whom we want to see succeed and find his happiness, it gets even tragically sweet at times. The Second sister Joy is the somewhat down on her luck one, she stills lives with her parents (who are in the middle of a separation) and isn't entirely open to love. I must say Jane Adam's gives a great performance, however I didn't really feel all that much sympathy or compassion for her, perhaps because she really didn't come as a person who deals with a lot. Then there is Trish who is the perfect stay at home wife, and her scenes are the scenes that will disturb you seeing how her husband Bill (played all too tragically realistic by Dylan Baker) is secretly a pedophile. Perhaps her life does focus more on Bill (as does the film), and the film doesn't shy away from the ugly truth. It's very disturbing when his pedophile side comes out (such as when he talks to his sexually curious son Billy). However honestly underneath it all it's sort of hard for us (the audience) to admit that we have a hidden liking towards him. The guilty part of it all is how we the viewer are repulsed, disturbed, but yet ironically indulged in the film. You can't look away even if you want too, but you can't, unless you're like mega sensitive towards kids or whatever. He actually is a good dad (even though it may have been his pedophile side talking), but we can't help but feel a small happiness when his son owns up to him the way he does.The direction and writing is extraordinary, and even better the performances are brilliant. I love how each woman manages to each give a different stand out performance, and stay true to their characters, as does everybody else in the film. I must say I also really admired the acting from the very brave roles such as Billy (Rufus Read), Bill (Dylan Baker), and Kristina (Camryn Manheim). It took guts to take on such roles, and why they (or anybody else in this film) didn't get Oscar nominations or recognition is beyond me.Overall I'm going to say one thing only about this film, although extraordinary and very wonderful it's a movie that is not, I repeat NOT for everybody. I would only recommend it if you are aware of some of Todd Solondz other deep meaning films (such as Palindromes or Storytelling) than you'll have an idea of what you'd get in too. I also strongly recommend to those who love films that challenge you, or that you're not afraid to be felt uncomfortable or even disturbed by a films dramatic subject matter. \"Happiness\" is a truly magnificent little film, sure very uncomfortable, but its disturbing-ness I think just enhances to the experience, and even enjoyment of this film for those who like that kind of thrill from films.",

            "review_title": "A modern masterpiece",
            "content": "*may contain some spoilers*First, I'll start off this review by saying sex is a powerful thing.  It seems to have the power to control everything.  People these days are always looking for more ways to have better sex lives, some are even making money from it.  Of course, everyone wants to get laid, and we've seen many, many films about people who get sex all the time.  However, there haven't been many SERIOUS films (not counting some lame teen comedies) about those who just can't get sex... either because they're considered too unattractive, their desire is out of reach, or what they want is just too taboo, or even illegal.  Probably the first film i've seen to accurately portray what i've mentioned is \"Happiness\".  I've never seen sexually unsatisfied people portrayed so accurately in a film until I saw \"Happiness\".  Todd Solondz is a brave filmmaker, and goes where nowhere else has gone in a film before. None of the characters in this film seem to be satisfied with their sex lives and their problems differ. One is a self-proclaimed boring and unattractive person who desires his beautiful neighbor but of course, can't have her; another is a seemingly typical middle-class father who hides a secret (and illegal) lust for his son's under-age friends; then we have a woman who is just too emotionally insecure to find the kind of man she wants.  These are just a few of the characters represented in \"Happiness\", and it's guaranteed that you will find yourself actually caring about them by the time the film is over.  Of course the most controversial aspect of the film is its portrayl of a pedophile; most people were angered because they felt as if Solondz was trying to make people sympathize with a pedophile, but that's not quite it.  You see, the pedophile in this film KNOWS he has a problem, he knows his feelings are wrong... but there's no way he can get help with these problems.  He tries to satisfy his forbidden desires by masturbating to teenybopper magazines, but eventually, the desire for the real thing overcomes him.  What Solondz is trying to say here is two things: one, a pedophile can be just about anyone (even your friendly neighborhood shrink) and two, pedophilia is something that can be prevented. These kind of people often know they have a problem, but there is no where they can go to get help for it.  It's a huge wake-up call.  Other than that, I didn't really find the film shocking... I found it more thought-provoking. Many of the scenes here weighed heavy on my mind afterwards, and I was constantly contemplating them in my head for days.  Not only must I give huge praise to director Todd Solondz for having the guts to come up with a film like this, I also must praise the cast.  They took on some of the most difficult roles in film history, and each one of them nailed their parts. Each line of dialogue in the biting script was delivered wonderfully and believably.  I'm really surprised that there was no oscar nominations for this film, although given the difficult subject matter, it's not surprising the often close-minded Academy shunned it (it's amazing to think that one year later, American Beauty, won a ton of awards from the Academy, when it was obviously a watered-down version of Happiness).  This is one of those rare films that has the ability to move you and disturb you, but it's definately not for everyone.  It should definately only be seen by mature audiences; i'm only 17 but I was able to handle it fine... although I wouldn't recommend it to many people my age, mainly due to the fact that they've been weaned on stuff like \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"XXX\", and therefore wouldn't really understand it.  Other than that, \"Happiness\" is perhaps the best movie I've ever seen.  The direction, acting and script are perfect.  I can't recommend it highly enough for open-minded people.\n10/10, one of my all-time favorites",

            "content": "What exactly \"is\" happiness this film attempts to explore, but mostly by focusing on what and where it isn't.  Todd Solondz, the writer/director of this film, evidently has a penchant for exposing the rottenness in American life.  His 1995 Welcome To The Dollhouse was something of an instant classic in its portrayal of teenage alienation and angst.  The brilliant contradictions of that film were followed by Happiness in 1998, then in 2001 with the predictable and obvious Storytelling, which used shock as a pretense for depth, made no worthwhile point, and was ultimately degrading and abusive.  In Happiness he retains some of the wit and irony of Dollhouse, while clearly moving in the direction of making the obvious seem profound.  At least in this one he does seem to \"like\" some of his characters enough to flesh them out with believable personalities, even while dragging them through miseries of their own creation.  Partially, therefore, the \"message\" seems to be that people tend to spoil their own best chances at happiness by living their lives too close to the mirror.  In other words, not being able to see themselves from a wider perspective, they never learn anything from their experiences.Unfortunately, while that message can be found here, it does not seem to have been intended.  Solondz likes to make his point by making no point at all.  Life is absurd and there \"is\" no point.  But while such wholesale nihilism may seem profound by championing the popular notion that there is no meaning or purpose to life, it rather begs the question by presuming too much.  That life may seem absurd does not mean that all apparent absurdities are equally ugly and rotten.  Indeed, many of the absurdities of life are quite delightful, beautiful, perhaps even inspirational.  By focusing only on the negative, therefore, this story gives its audience no hope.Nobody knows and there are no answers, it vainly argues.  Even the \"psychologist\" doesn't know anything, and just in case we might have been tempted to think that he could, he is presented as a psycho with a secret obsession too unspeakable to mention.  Hence, no one can be trusted.  If even the psychologists are at root hypocrites, liars or fools, then how much less anyone else, this film amply demonstrates.  Everyone is stupid, nothing makes sense, and anyone who pretends to think otherwise is either a victim or a predator.  Which is not to say that this film is lacking in perception or wit, just that its view of humanity is cynical and pathetic.  It is intellectual \"ism!\"  Not in terms of how it can rise above, but in terms of how it can sink below.",

I think the reason this movie achieves its success is because the characters are so \"normal\" on the outside, but yet, they live disturbingly different lives in secret.  Instead of saying you can cut through the tension with a butter knife, you can say you can cut through the \"normalcy\" with a butter knife.This is the second time I've seen Happiness, and I normally try to avoid seeing a movie more than once.

Being a Woody Allen fan, I very much  liked to see his former wife, Louise Lasser, since I have not seen much of her these last years. And talking about Allen, Happiness is not so far from him, dealing with people with sexual frustrations, perversions and miseries, in a somewhat funny way.

I had to turn it off because I could not take in the story of these people.  It made me feel disturbed for watching.  However, the next morning I awoke wanting to know what happens to these people.

One is a language teacher trying to find the right man after a disastrous breakup, another is a hollow and successful writer who is gleamingly generic, while the other is an oblivious mother and housewife. All of them unaware of what kind of problems they have. One is being stalked via obscene phone calls by a pervert who lives in the apartment building with her, Another, is unaware that her husband happens to be a pedophile, and another thinks the right man, may not be.Review: Very controversial, \"Happiness\" met with many objections from parents groups and the MPAA, for it's graphic content. Content dealing with pedophilia, rape, masturbation, and suicide, amongst other subjects that are completely off the wall real. Solondz deals with the material honestly because that's how he shows it. Dylan Baker completely eschews any role he's ever portrayed to play a pathetic doctor whose actions drive him to rape a small child. \"My son's a fag.\" says one father to another. It's honest and it's brutal, and Solondz wants the audience to understand the picture. Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a career making performance as the twisted pervert who has a bizarre connection with Lara Flynn Boyle, with Camryn Manheim as a desperate neighbor. Absolutely the most disturbing film that has been released in a movie theater, Happiness pulls all the punches and it's material, while uncompromising, is brilliant. There's nothing more engrossing, than watching Saturday Night Live alumni Jon Lovitz, suffer a nervous breakdown after being dumped.Grade: A-",

            "content": "Happiness / dir. Todd Solondz / 1998 The best scene in Happiness is the very first, featuring Jon Lovitz in, perhaps, his best performance on screen. Lovitz is only in these first five or so minutes, but delivers a distressing performance, exploding from heartbreak when he is rejected for not being a traditionally attractive man. It is an honest and true performance in a film filled with essentially loathsome characters. The Lovitz character is one of many who are disappointed with their current life situation, but he is the only one who can conjure up any sort of sympathy.Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays the nebbish Allen, a lonely man who gets off on thoughts of his sultry neighbor, Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle), and making prank phone calls. Joy (Jane Adams) finds herself 30 and without a career or a husband. Her two sisters are successful, one being Helen, and the other Trish (Cynthia Stevenson), who is happily married to psychiatrist Dr. Bill Mapplewood (Dylan Baker). Allen confides his secrets to Dr. Mapplewood, but Bill has a secret of his own: an insatiable lust for young boys.Happiness wants to be an ironic comedy about life, but the film is too heavy handed to be found funny. The child molestation subplot is too serious of a situation to be taken lightly. The biggest problem is the angle to which it was approached. The molestations take place off-screen and is as tastefully done as the subject allows, but there is something slightly creepy about watching an eleven year old boy talk to his father about semen and masturbation. Obviously, these scenes are to be shocking to the audience, but they are a little too unsettling and they don't achieve their function for the film. These conversations feed into the child molester's obsession, but it would have been much more interesting had the film actually examined the psyche of the child molester, instead of hinting at aspects and then dropping them to move on to a different subplot. In the end, the scenes are an exercise in pushing the sexual envelope, but they don't amount to much and only make the film harder to sit through.The audience is meant to relate to the characters in the film, but it is very hard when all of them are so uninteresting and unlikable. Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character complains that no one likes him because he is boring and the film does nothing to disprove that. It is hard for the audience to sympathize for a man who makes sexual phone calls and masturbates for 90% of his screen time. The character of Joy lives the saddest life and it is a shame that the screenplay never allows us to actually care about her. She comes off as shrill and annoying and, in those first scenes with Jon Lovitz, a tad bit superficial. Her sister, Helen, is just as uninteresting. An author who is tired of being attractive to men, she's not only superficial, but a complete bore.It's a shame about the characters, because the cast is full of consummate actors. Hoffman plays these types of characters perfectly, but he never gets to do anything with it. Baker finds the ideal balance between normal family man and pedophile. Jane Adams is merely serviceable and doesn't try to make her character any more likable. Stevenson is wonderful, but Boyle is a little over-the-top.There is one other standout in the film and that is Camryn Manheim, who manages to make the audience empathize with her even when she finds herself doing inhuman things. But just the fact that the film feels the need to place her in such a situation proves how miserable the movie really wants to be. Many times, scenes come off as completely inappropriate and unnecessary. Happiness is two hours and twenty minutes drowned in unpleasantness. It is a tough film to watch, not only because of its subject matter, but because of its sheer pessimism.",

It shamelessly and effectively presents us with characters and situations that grind against these values.The story intertwines the lives of three Sisters and some of the characters that they encounter. Joy (Jane Adams), hopelessly timid and repressed, longs to be a singer but is prone to tearful breakdowns. Trish Maplewood (Cynthia Stevenson), the wife that has everything but a realist world view and exciting sex life, and Helen (Lara Flynn-Boyle) a novelist with writers block that has no time for people's real issues but wishes she could write about them authentically. Add to this Trish's psychiatrist husband Bill Maplewood (a superbly controlled Dylan Baker), who has some less than healthy urges. Not to mention Helen's prank calling pervert Allen (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and you have a wide, bizarre range of characters.But the character's would be nothing without the world that Todd Solondz so masterfully creates. In a similar way to Magnolia and American Beauty, many of the characters chronicled seem to have perfect, healthy lifes. What makes Happiness so challenging is that these people are not dribbling, word slurring fiends but actual people with real (if not disturbing and problematic) urges.Baker's character can communicate effectively and with worrying honesty to his Son, while simultaneously having the uncontrollable desire to drug and 'play with' his school friend. Flynn-Boyle's attractive novelist clearly has so much to offer, that she sees fit to ingnore the people that could become her very inspiration, while Seymour Hoffman's nuisance caller has a ready made relationship in the form of a keen and relentlessly insecure neighbour Christina (Camryn Manheim).Happiness uses hints at these darkest of dark character quirks to see just how far his audience will go. We know that Bill Maplewood will commit an act of paedophilia, we know that Allen will eventually meet - and be rejected by the only person that finds the concept of him exciting, and we know that Joy will be used and discarded for sex the minute she trusts someone, but we watch on just to see how grim their existence's can get. And the cause of all this incomprehensible, disturbing behaviour? The pursuit of happiness.Maybe I'm making it all too simple, but Happiness is the deepest darkest realms of where American Beauty and Magnolia go in order to ask the audience how their life really is.",

            "content": "I am a fan of black comedies and I usually try to get my hands on any I can find, but it surprised me how everyone kept telling me how deeply disturbing this film is. I am a very easily affected person, so I naturally shy-ed away from this particular film. I also kept hearing that this was a great movie experience albeit the disturbing content, so I finally caved in and bought it one day.My best friend who also enjoys black comedies came over to watch it with me, and throughout the two hours it lasts we both sat nailed to our seats alternately laughing our heads off and gasping in amazement and horror at the situations therein. By the end, we could do nothing but admit that, while it is indeed disturbing, it is perhaps one of the best black comedies we've ever seen.It's about three sisters. Joy, who just broke up with her loser boyfriend and throughout the film tries to maintain a dim-witted sunny side amidst gut-wrenchingly depressing situations and encounters. There's also Helen, a famous and gorgeous writer who writes dark poems and who aims to have an affair with a repulsively twisted and obscene caller. And there's Trish, a housewife who pretends to be perfect and to have it all while her 'respectable' husband indulges in a terribly disturbing mania.Throughout the film, these three sisters and the rest of the characters with which they are connected slowly and excruciatingly tumble into a downward spiral of depression, subtly yet savagely exposing the so-called 'perfection' of middle-class. The title of the film, \"Happiness\", is of course ironic, so you might probably guess the general tone of the film.It is a depressing film, it is shocking and disturbing but it also is undeniably funny. Todd Solondz has masterfully found a way to unite a crude portrayal of the darker side of life with witty and hilarious dialogue. You'll laugh and feel disgusted simultaneously. You'll laugh at things you would never even think of laughing about. And you will most definitely have mixed feelings about it by the end. But if there's one thing that you'll definitely agree with, is that you have just experienced a piece of life, savagely honest, however crude and evil it might be. And you'll also agree that the aim of the film, apart from exposing the truth we usually try to shield our eyes from, is to demonstrate how opposite feelings really do exist in life.This film is not for the faint-minded, but for those of you who approach it with an open mind and an artistic sense, you'll find you'll be rewarded with an incredibly good movie experience.Rating: 3 stars and a half out of 4!",

Reich also argued that the repression of orgasmic sexuality was the cornerstone of all social, psychological, and political repression (and oppression). HAPPINESS could have been written by Wilhelm Reich himself; it argues the same thesis--that human beings most want transcendence through sexual gratification and are most often derived of it. The irony is that it is precisely the guilty repression of the sex drive that leads to all manner of neurosis and perversion. Distilled to its essence, HAPPINESS argues that society only appears to be comprised of a complex sexual pecking order, based on looks, age, status etc. In reality, even the most conventionally desirable have very problematic sex lives because desire is more primal that convention; it circulates freely and unpredictably and often confounds the logic of commodification. Though a wrenching viewing experience, HAPPINESS is a that rarity: a film of ideas. It is also a brilliantly articulated plea for a reassessment of the power of the sexual urge and the basic human need for moments of transcendence in a society devoted to stupefaction, escapism, and infantile dreams of omnipotence.",

            "content": "This is definitely a great movie, and yes its even entertaining! Everything is about confronting the truth in a decaying society that we live in, and I truly appreciate the director for not jumping into the popular Hollywood scriptwriting style that prevails in today's American films.  Its also great to see someone attempting to throw the norm out the window.  Lara Flynn Boyle is, as always, very sexy, and I'm glad to see the brilliant veteran Ben Gazarra back in form.It doesn't bother me that the characters are not punished for their unlawful actions since the story does not revolve around the usual doctorine of the so-called 'civilized' society.  But there's one thing that bothered me though - about Joy's terrible experience with the Russian refugee who happens to be a thief.  At first Joy was against the lame protesters who accused the refugees of draining the country's economy which can be used for beneficiary pay.  Because of just ONE refugee's bad attitude, Joy has turned from a refugee sympathizer into someone who supports the protesters's ideas against ALL refugees.  All I can say was ... WHAT ?????  Forget the masturbation and the phaedophile rapist - those did not bother me in the slightest!Yes, I took it personally - the main problem is that the film did not signify any IRONY in Joy's bad experience with one refugee, as if the director made his statement about refugees as a fact.  As a film student, I tried to think of the director's intentions for the film, and I always try to give any ill feeling the benefit of a doubt.  After all, filmmaking is about exposing the truth derived from the director's experience in life, and in this case, 'Happiness' turns out to be great.  BUT, that one flaw about portraying ALL refugees in a bad light leaves me with a sour taste.  I can't help it.  It really reminded me the blatantness of 'Birth of a Nation' by D.W Griffith which I watched a few years ago.I really liked this movie, but it actually made me think more about the merits of the so-called 'responsible' filmmaking.  I never cared about responsible filmmaking before until now, thinking that creating a work of art must not be bound by society's standards.  But if a film offends someone, does that mean its a great work of art?  Maybe, or maybe not.  I don't know.  I just hope people know better.",

So it's a wierd subject matter that is handled very tastefully. The story is kind of a Short Cuts/Playing By Heart where there are a bunch of stories interwined and connected to each other. The reason the movie is so great is both because of it's stories and because of it's humor. You will never see this many interesting stories together. Movies aren't that smart. Ussually, if you get one or two good stories, like in Four Rooms, the other two are lousy. If all four were great, the movie would be incredible. Well, in Happiness, all four are great. And more.

Right from the start of the movie, you are in a position where you can do nothing but laugh.  You are thrown into disturbing, twisted situations in a way that no film has done before.  This film is not for the squeamish, moral, or conventional.  Solondz is the darkest of any director I've encountered, and his films serve as an important outlet for anyone who didn't have a cake-walk upbringing or things handed to them.  This film is for people who have experienced the darker parts of life, had things taken from them, and had to earn what they have.  But that isn't enough, you also have to appreciate that everything can be comedy.  Beware of people who sit through this movie and seem appalled and put off... they likely take themselves far too seriously and are dominated by their environment.  Kinda like Oscar's comedy discrimination, I rarely give comedies perfect 10's.  This is an important exception. 10/10",

            "content": "Happiness is a story of three sisters; Joy, Trish and Helen, and weaves in characters who are a part their life. Joy is the angel, the kindest, albeit naive sister who is faced with harsh hurdle after hurdle; a symbol of hope in a grim world. Trish is the housewife and loving mother to her children; conceited yet kind at heart who glues the family together. Helen is the successful artist; independent, successful, condescending while deceptively confident. We also get a sexually frustrated psychiatrist, lonely geek who makes obscene phone calls, a worn-out old couple and more. The film's ensemble cast are sublime, hilarious and reflect people we all 'know' or think we know. Featuring a smorgasbord of nuanced and memorable characters, Dylan Baker steals the show as Bill Maplewood, a psychiatrist with grotesque fantasies who society would unquestionably label a monster. His performance gets under your skin and lingers in your mind days after watching. What makes him so memorable is that despite his appalling and unforgivable acts he is remarkably sympathetic, honest and far beyond what could've easily been just a cruel and heartless caricature. Happiness explores themes of rape, pedophilia, loneliness, belonging and sexuality with a dynamite script that is funny, morbid, moving and drenched in subtext. Solondz uses a unique voice to convey how society uses sex and fantasy to fill certain life voids and strive to create their version of happiness. The film is perhaps one of the darkest black-comedies ever and deals with similar ideas and characters found in American Beauty, only grittier and unflinching. My only flaws with the film are its its length and overindulgence. This narrative where a handful of characters link up as the story moves forward is comparable to movies like 'Magnolia', 'Crash', 'Pulp Fiction', 'Rat Race' etc. While the style is ambitious it becomes problematic as the plot loses focus, punch and is usually overwrought. Pulp Fiction is probably the sharpest mesh-character movie I've seen because it focuses on fewer characters. Happiness falls into the trap of being too ambitious when the three-sisters' marriage-torn parents get introduced. Their story felt superfluous and lacked the meat, exploration and commentary found in the other arcs. I still give Happiness a 9 because Todd Solondz' magnum opus is a brave, memorable movie with heart, hilarity and vigor. There aren't many filmmakers audacious enough to 'go there' without being pure shock-value. Happiness makes thick-skinned audiences squeamish, but it resonates with you for days like many films don't and is a must see if you can handle the subject matter.",

            "content": "Solondz's film merely reinforces my impression that American independent cinema is the finest in the world. 'Happiness' sparkles with comedy, yet there is a constant sickening thud as scene after scene revels in the grossest, blackest examples of human behaviour.The packed audience on the night I went was frequently in hysterics at the tactlessness and hopelessness of the characters (so much so that I'm going to have to go back to catch all the jokes I missed because of the laughter). As the film developed, however, a chill crept slowly over people, and the crucial sequence between Dylan Baker and his son was met in gripped silence (apart from a couple of idiots in front of me, who found the whole thing hilarious - though perhaps they were laughing as a nervous reaction).Solondz's triumph lies in his audacity. So often I found myself catching my breath, gasping in horror at what he had put on film, but managing at the same time to express admiration that he had done it so skilfully. To be able to make a paedophile a subject of humour successfully, and to make him a sympathetic character at the same time, is an achievement so profound I cannot express my awe. It is only sad that Dylan Baker, who deserved a Best Supporting Actor Oscar more than any of the nominees, was denied a place in the Hall of Fame, presumably precisely because of the nature of his role.Attention naturally focuses on Baker, but the other cast members are perfection, especially Hoffman and Adams (a real find - where did she spring up from?). Nobody in this film is likeable - yet we recognise ourselves in their frailty, and cannot help rooting for them.I give it 9 rather than 10 out of 10, because it has a few faults: Solondz could have trimmed 10-15 minutes off it (he has a tendency to linger at the end of sequences); the story of the divorcing parents never really goes anywhere, where it could have been the most interesting; and the revelation of Hoffman's overweight neighbour strikes a false note - the only time when Solondz goes a little too much OTT.But, overall, I salute Todd Solondz for courage, wit, intelligence and humanity. If only more films could be like this.",

Should I feel sorry for this pedophile even while his actions are morally, ethically, and naturally wrong? I liked Todd Solondz's WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE very much, but should I prefer it over HAPPINESS just because it's easier to swallow? I still don't know.The more I think about HAPPINESS, the more genius I see it as. When you look at a movie like AMERICAN BEAUTY, you see beautiful people trying their hardest to look ugly and use dysfunction as a trend, something cool to watch in a movie. That's stupid. And the more I think about AMERICAN BEAUTY, the more I see what's wrong with it.HAPPINESS contains a barrel full of unhappy people, whose personal stories intertwine with each other's. Some stories are easier to take than the others, and that's what is kind of funny in a way. One scene you're squirming in your chair and the next you can breathe easily in relief, but the easiest way to take this movie is to know it's a comedy. A corrosive and DARK adult comedy, where the laughs come nervously and you don't even know if you should laugh at what you're seeing. One character I can't get out of my head, that relentlessly made my skin crawl, was the child molesting father played by Dylan Baker. He's not exactly a villain, yet I find him creepier than Hannibal Lecter. That's because he's a real guy, or at least a real guy played by a professional actor. And what an incredible actor! Anyone who has the power to taunt the audience without playing some serial killer or other overplayed antagonists, deserves fine raves and acknowledgement. I hope Dylan Baker finds other great works in the near future, that is, if producers aren't disgusted of him!",

            "content": "Imagine you're surfing youtube and come across a disturbing video - let's say it's a video of a group of teenagers viciously bullying a schoolmate. They insult the victim in every way they can think of, calling him ugly, stupid, weak, repulsive, and on and on. Imagine they start pushing him, then slapping, then kicking. He tries to get away but they won't let him escape. The victim is afraid and he is clearly suffering intensely, yet his pain only seems to bring his attackers more joy. Now imagine the clip ends abruptly, with no resolution.Happiness is much like this imaginary youtube clip, but magnified and stretched over two hours. The film has no plot, in the sense of a meaningful series of events. Things happen, but there is no \"story\" being told. The film functions only to document human ugliness and suffering in the most agonizing detail possible. It depicts several people causing and experiencing suffering, and then eventually the credits roll.I've seen other films that had no storyline, some of which I think were very good, so when I say that Happiness has no plot, I don't mean it as a criticism. I'm simply stating a fact. I've also seen many films that depicted human suffering, and in fact I think the majority of my favourite films have done so to a greater or lesser degree. This is not surprising since art is largely about \"the human condition\", and whatever else it might involve, that condition certainly has its share of suffering.However, the crucial difference between films I have enjoyed and Happiness is how that suffering is depicted. Films are not mirrors. There is no such thing as simply showing the world \"as it really is\" \u2013 or rather, every film show the world as it is in some aspect. What distinguishes the good ones is that they show it to us in a way that is surprising, compelling, enlightening, etc. So those who claim that a film is \"art\" (by which they usually mean \"good art\") simply because it depicts suffering are very mistaken.Some examples of films that have depicted suffering effectively include: American Beauty, Taxi Driver, Jacob's Ladder, Last Tango in Paris, etc. Though all very different they all share one common feature: they allow us to relate to the characters whose pain we are witnessing. We may not condone or agree with their actions, but we see why they are doing them. We may not share their motivations, but we understand them. We are shown how their fears and desires lead them into and through (and sometimes miraculously, out of) their particular sufferings. It is this revealing of the sad and beautiful complexity beneath our common human suffering that makes these films great.In Happiness, I saw none of this revelation. I saw only the characters' ugly surfaces, deformed by the wounds they sustained and/or inflicted on others. Even when supposedly deeper motives were revealed, these too proved to be equally shallow and equally deformed.The question that immediately rose to mind upon watching Happiness was \"why?\" Why did Todd Solondz make this movie? I have found three possible answers. The first is that he thinks that watching people suffer in the way presented in this film is funny. I hope this is not the case. If so, I would like to say to Solondz, and to those people who have described Happiness as a comedy, \"please seek out the help of a good counsellor or caring friend, because right now you are very, very lost\". The scenes in Happiness shouldn't evoke laughter any more than watching a handicapped child get beaten should. While I'm sure there are people who would laugh in both cases, this doesn't mean there is anything funny in either. Such scenes can be laughed only in the absence of empathy, and without empathy, we're less than human and life is little more than a confused nightmare.The second possibility is that Solondz wanted to inflict the disturbing content of this movie on audiences as a form of violence. If Solondz sees the content of his film for what is really is \u2013 the psychological equivalent of \"torture porn\" \u2013 then what motive could he have for making it other than as an expression of anger or hatred towards his anticipated audience?Finally, perhaps the most generous possibility is that in Happiness, Solondz is just showing us the world as he sees it. If this is so, then I feel a great deal of sympathy for him, for it is a miserable and empty world indeed. In fact, I find it hard to imagine anyone seeing the world so bleakly and yet still wanting to continue living in it. Personally, I think even a week of such unremitting wretchedness would have me wishing for death.These are the only explanations for this film that I can imagine, and the few alternative explanations I've read have all been based on mistaken or seriously limited views of art or life itself. I wish I were wrong, because whichever of my explanations you agree with, Happiness is very sad film. It's sad that such a film was ever made, and sad that people enjoyed it.",

If you find this film vulgar or shocking then you're missing the point.  Sure, these examples are extremes, but we all have our dark sides and experiences in sexuality best left unspoken.  If you're sickened and depressed by it, then it made some point, although your ego may not have let you note it.There are no main characters. You watch these people interact, and find a hard time deciding who is the protagonist here.  The characters are that well rounded.  No one is purely bad or purely evil, they're just human.I was happy to see such a \"graphic\" portrayal of people.  It was all justified in the context of the story (this is called character development).  If you're squeamish about seeing portrayals of real people in the movies stick to Michael Bay or Chris Columbus.  This movie dares to break down the barrier of sentimentality (not just \"shock\") in film.  What a waste, that the movie industry and most of the Hollywood \"cultured\" masses that attend films can't open there minds, leading directors like Solondz and Paul Thomas Anderson to struggle for \"artistic integrity,\" because so many people are so arrogant and fearful to look in the mirror.",

For those who saw his heavily acclaimed (by critics and audiences alike) \"Welcome To The Dollhouse\" a movie about the hell almighty on earth that is junior high school.I was not one of the film's many admirers. Yes, I felt like just about everybody else that the film did have some poignant truths, but... I pretty much already knew them all. It all felt kinda redundant.I was in high school at the time and every scene I was watching, I thought, \"Yeah, no sh*t\" and \"God, these people are *ssholes and idiots.\" I mean, I know it's supposed to be a satire, but I felt too much like I was watching what I already knew and thought and what has been said too many times before.His next film, \"Happiness\" about three sisters and their lives... and how adulthood is more or less as mentally unbalanced as junior high school. About three sisters and how their lives aren't as well-adjusted as they seem. Actually, the sisters are just the core of the storyline.The seemingly ideal perfect sister is dry, secretly dull and lives such a sterile life that when an obscene caller gives her an obscene call... and she likes the idea of what he says so much... that she starts stalking him. Guess she hasn't done much slumming in her life.Just thought you'd all like to know what you're getting into.The best line in the movie \"Happiness\"... that almost encapsulates the entire film:\"I'm not laughing at you, I'm laughing with you.\" \"But I'm not laughing.\"I preferred \"Happiness\" to \"Dollhouse,\" perhaps because \"Happiness\" illuminated a side of the more well-behaved supposed \"perfect ideal\" middle-class suburban lifestyle. It's sort of like a more pessimistic and repulsive \"Hannah and Her Sisters\"--- it deals wit three sisters and their lives and the misery in which they have to deal with in their lives.It satirically attacks that supposed ideal upper-middle white class which seem successful and ideal... and peel back the layer and reveal how closeted, emotionally deformed and miserable they truly are.(Spoilers here, brace yourself)The pedophile material about the father who molests his son's best friend at a sleepover is really going to get under people's skin and make them gasp.Bill (the father who's also a child psychiatrist, for probably the nature of his obsession) wonders about his own son's sexuality, but his is really the dangerous one. The father-son material is Solondz risqu\u00e9-satire as it's absolute best. It's sad the movie bombed theatrically (mostly because the pedophile material got the movie an NC-17. So the movie was released with no rating at all).Solondz is fascinated and obsessed with the darker and more quiet secrets that fester from behind those white-suburban doors. He's from Jersey, from that class of neighborhood that he lampoons so often and so well.Here is the one man from Jersey who dares to make something of himself. I know, I know, I know. It's such an easy target, Jersey. Hell, even NY makes fun of Jersey. Nobody gives it respect--except Kevin Smith. He's the only one who shows his town some love. Not many filmmakers come out of Jersey. Now Jersey can proudly claim Solondz and Smith.CLOSING NOTE: This movie contains frank sexual talk, coarse dialouge, and rape (taking place off-screen) and some serious emotional abuse. I really enjoyed it. I strongly recommend it. But you should all really know what you're getting into.The movie originally got an NC-17 rating. It has not been edited. Solondz simply released it with no rating at all. You have all been warned.--Still Pursuing Happiness, Dane Youssef",

But unlike that newly fashionable religion, the film offers no consolation: it's darker, scarier, more cynical and ironic than virtually anything that came before, short of Greek Tragedy. This is an exaggeration, of course: still, the fate of one of Solondz's resident perverts, a pedophile psychologist ,inspires the very feelings Aristotle himself prescribed to Tragedy: pity and fear. The other characters are pathetic in their own individual ways: no age group or gender is overlooked. Some of the plot developments are indeed so disturbing that even the most desensitized members of the audience cannot help but cringe; after the first ten minutes, it's impossible to remain unaffected. Yes, Happiness can be an amazing experience,but even with all of its emotional arsenal,the movie is no masterpiece. The director is overly preoccupied with sheer contextual impact, or shock value, and seems to neglect some other cinematic ingredients. Esthetically, the film needs to be more concisely structured and better edited, to maintain its momentum. The storylines are intersected at random, not with the brilliant logic of Pulp Fiction. This frequent cutting and pasting becomes confusing and the picture often looses its focus. Some scenes are unnecessarily lengthy, their excessive pauses lessening the immediate visceral effect. Perhaps, if Solondz went back to the editing room and tightened things up a bit, he would have produced a 10. Regardless of its considerable flaws, Happiness is a movie for our times. Anyone who has ever felt rejected, lonely, trapped, or overwhelmed by powerful instincts should find much in common with its losers. Those of us who are more fortunate will sign with relief, those who are less will be reassured that they are not alone.",

I really did like it and though most of it was a real hoot.  Save for the pedophelia, which is obviously very messed up, did the producers and the writer director think that we would not get that someone ejaculated if we did not see it?  In other words, did the viewer have to see \"semen\" to know it happened and did it add any more to the story?  While many people might call this film genius and I'm sure scenes like the aforementioned added to the fact they didn't let this get an MPAA rating, I really don't feel it added to the anything other than the graphic nature that makes people go ewww!  If that is the route, why not cover everyone who feels like sh*t with feces?  Why not let us see the sputum dripping off the actresses face after being spat on?  John Waters may have...Did the conversation between the pedophile and his kid add up to contribute to the story, or was it allowed because it was known how disturbing it might be.  Would it not have been just as shocking without having all the gory details thrust before us?Is a bludgeoning murder any less murder or disturbing just because you do not see the blood splattered on the wall or witness a crushed, deformed skull?  That is the real question that might be asked here.  While Vachon (Christine--the producer) has made her mark going that extra mile to do films other producers might not touch, ultimately, that which took away a rating here, could invariably be left out to produce as much a shocking portrait of dissonance as it did being left in.  Seeing the semen on the wall just took away from the wider market this work might have garnered had it not been left there to post cards upon.  Not even the local Blockbuster will carry this, and that's a shame for getting one's message out for sure. \nIf those making the film didn't want nor care to release it broadly as possible, what is the point in this day and age--just to say they could? Still, I'd say it is a great film, but not as great as it might have been with just a bit more tweaking.  That tweak kept this off the Academy lists for certain.

Unfortunately Solendz hits the audience in the face with over-the-top scenes that can do nothing but revolt the viewer. For example, the films final scene, in which the son comes out, so to speak, is totally overpowered by its graphic nature, and the fact the dog (and then his mother)share in this \"victory.\"  Presumably that, and other scenes, were intended to be funny. I couldn't bring myself to laugh. However, he did manage to be more gross than just about any film you can think of (Something About Mary and all of the early John Waters films included). Congratulations, Mr. Director. Ironically, I've heard critics talk about the film's nuanced and subtle display of the depravity of American life. Please. This was subtle like \"Natural Born Killers\" was subtle. It was two hours of the Jerry Springer Show with better actors. When are critics going to grow up and stop giving out awards to people just because they \"push the envelope?\" When the envelope's empty, all that's left is is the shock value. And in this movie, 2 hours and 20 mins of shock is way too long.  At least I bonded with the rest of the theatre who were also uncomfortably squirming, coughing, and looking at their watches.",

There was a strong note of mockery - note the use of the musical score - beautiful music contrasting with sordid behaviour - the masturbation of a telephone sex-pest set to a lovely operatic piece and an upbeat flute introduction to scenes involving the pederast's family.A daring piece of cinema that I'm sure would be difficult for some people to take.We should welcome it when somebody dares us to step outside our comfort zone.The film certainly introduces us to some gruesome monsters - the two elder sisters Trish and Helen gloating over their younger sister's failures (in the guise of sisterly concern of course)sticks in my mind. It's almost as repulsive as the actions of Trish's perverted husband - you feel that they deserve each other.Full marks to Todd Solondz for an unique piece of work Walt Disney it certainly wasn't - but all the better for it!",

T. Anderson's \"Magnolia\"). Solondz's tale is accurately and astonishingly well done, with enough humor mixed in to keep the viewer from turning it off and running away shrieking. on the negative side however is Solondz's typical static camera work (see \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\" twice: first to be amazed at his script and Heather Matarazzo's amazing performance. then watch it a 2nd time and realize how devastatingly dull the cinematography is. in that film the camera work was somewhat forgivable because it really really felt like everyone both cast and crew was still learning the ropes. \"Happiness\" features a full cast of quality actors and a complete armada of crew members and yet you can see tree roots taking hold in the corners of some shots.) also unsettling is a sameness of the actors deliveries. most every character is in near paralytic pain and this leads to a lot of supposedly supercharged droning; but sometimes it just sounds like droning.  maybe that sounds a little harsh on a film i just gave a 9 vote to (in fact i'd give it an 8, but it is, i swear, one hell of a script). still, after the shock value and arresting depiction of human misery wear off, you are still left wishing Solondz would stick to scripts and let someone else direct, preferably someone who can remember no matter what the bathos they are called \"moving\" pictures.",

The opening words are shocking, brutal, and totally truthful, things the film loses very quickly. Instead of going for an emotional structure, the film delves into the same sick, overblown, gross spewing of bodily fluids that occupies many comedies these days. In those films, they are played for laughs. Here, they serve no purpose other than to shock; to make the audience feel like they're watching something insightful and interesting. During the manipulative moments of suspense, like when a suburban pederast hovers over a young boy with a sick depravity in his eyes, we should feel terrified. Instead, I felt very cheated. All that this film has done is taken an ordinary human drama and inserted numerous shots of ejaculation that make no effort to spare the audience any sense of taste. In teen comedies, this is disgusting. Here it is considered art. I had just about had it in with film a good part through, but I stuck it out until the end. After all of the ignorance this film shows to humanity, we see the aftermath of a suburban father raping a small boy. After everything else, we aren't subjected to a rape scene, thank God, but for all that apparently went on, there is no soul left in the film. After all that, one of the final shots is of another boy ejaculating off a hotel balcony. I do not want to see that in any film, but this one has the nerve to end itself with Micheal Stipe singing \"Happiness, where are you? I haven't got a clue...\" with the kind of chipper, country folk styling that always makes me cringe. With this, the film fools you into thinking that it was actually about the way people find happiness, making you forget all the sick scenes that came before. Well I wasn't fooled, folks, and you shouldn't be either.",

The earnestness of the father/son conversations harks back to the family fare of 50s and 60s television, though the subject matter certainly doesn't.Also noteworthy is the music which manages to slyly comment on events with its insidious, banal sentimentality.Certainly not a movie for everyone.",

It returns over and over to the theme that people just don't do a good job of connecting with each other.  They don't listen and they don't love.  The other major theme is the sickness that can be found in the suburbs.  There, under the guise of normality, the most profound sicknesses can be found.The film does not cut any corners.  It looks into violence, sexual fetishes, and pedophilia like few other films.  It proves that film can still shock and have a purpose, which is nice in this age of been there, done that.  Quite often, people find themselves unhappy because they have redirected their sexual energies into unhealthy objects, such as children. Of course, even the obese woman finds herself in a unique and awful situation. By always making even the most benign character have a bizarre personality flaw, Solondz keeps the viewer off-balance and confused.The film is quite funny, but also touching.  You can really feel for some of the misfit characters, even the father who does such a horrible thing.  We learn that actions are not as individual as we would like, and we learn that people have limitations.  Overall, I felt that the film has a rare humanity that is usually lost in modern Hollywood product.  Perhaps if we would all just be a bit more honest with each other, talk about who we are and why, then we would all find the movie's title.  Since the film's characters cannot do that, at least with each other, they remain unhappy.  Of course, when they fulfill their needs, they are often punished.  We are given clues to why we all are so odd during the film, and I hope viewers take note.",

Not once.Every character was hopelessly uninteresting and one-dimensional. Who cares?The following could be considered \"SPOILERS\" although there is not much to spoil.I am not easily shocked, or conservative, but much of the movie seemed to be there only so that those responsible could say \"look, our movie talks about or shows this or that\" - in this case we get semen shooting on to a wall in one scene, then later, semen shooting onto a balcony railing to be licked off by a dog. Wonderful.Maybe the humor was in the sex-ed Q&A between the 11-year old son and father, where words of wisdom included the fact that it's not the length that is important, but the width (so says the dad), and that \"come\" can be a verb as well as a noun. Insightful!I can't find a way to get any humor out of anally raping young boys - and I'm afraid Happiness couldn't find it either - unless it was the father's line to his 11-year old son that he would only jerk off instead of raping him. Witty.OK, OK, I did find the one bit of humor. It was at the restaurant when Camryn Mannheim's character orders a hot fudge sundae after talking about murdering the doorman who helped carry her groceries to her apartment and asked for some ice before raping her.But seriously, it could have gotten an oscar for best special effect - creating an animatronic character looking exactly like Lara Flynn Boyle. Sorry, Lara, at least in Twin Peaks we knew you were dead. Look carefully at the DVD back cover. See Lara flat and unmoving? That represents her action sequence.The rest of the characters?

It's rare for movies these days to disturb and enchant in equal measures, but Happiness with its great characters and their complex problems, superb musical score, and hard-hitting approach to some of life's darker issues, does it very well. How something this bleak can be so entertaining is a mystery - that could be why the movie is so great.

It makes his films singular, although not necessarily comfortable to sit through. I come away from his movies(especially Welcome to the Dollhouse) thinking about the true consequences of the hurt people(and, by extension, I) perpetrate on other people- you cant help but thinking that these semi-comical tragedies and victimizations are happening as we speak and that speaks to the power of Solondz' vision.

The material was unrestrained, as all films *should* be but rarely are.As for the film-making style itself, well there was none.  It plays like a documentary.  But I don't think anyone interested in \"THE MATRIX\"-quality pizazz would be watching this anyway.  The atmospheres are dull and drab, possibly on purpose, and they offer no visual comfort.  So, even in a literal way, this movie is hard to watch.The movie relies completely on the script.  It's all discussion and dramatic arguments and what not.  It could even be a play.  The main characters are all in a life they don't want, except for certain ones that ARE happy who don't realize they are not wanted or cared for.  These range from a pederast father who rapes his son's friends, the son who wants to ejaculate for the first time as his peers do and can't, an obscene phone stalker who can't confront women, and a woman who loses over and over again and seems doomed for failure.  The title of the movie refers to what all of the characters are in search for.Although this movie is unpleasant, appalling, offensive to some, and emotionally wrenching, it rings TRUE, which makes it all the more disturbing.

            "content": "Solondz's higher budget and epic-length follow up to \u0091Welcome to the Dollhouse' provokes much the same confused response, in that you are never sure if you are meant to be laughing or not. It traces a few days in the lives of some of the most piteous characters ever committed to celluloid, dysfunctional in their relationships with one another, their sexuality and their aspirations. The number of characters involved are responsible for the lengthy running time, because aside from a dominant story involving the paedophile activities of one of them, the actual sub-stories which occur are generally low key and trivial. This is not a criticism, because Solondz has obviously set out to portray a suburban milieu which is poorly represented by the US mainstream. What is questionable is whether subject such as paedophilia should be treated as comedy. Given the brouhaha which arose over the release of Adrian Lyne's \u0091Lolita' last year, I'm amazed that the subject has come up in so many recent films. Similar to \u0091Class Trip' and \u0091Festen', \u0091Happiness' treats it more as a plot device than a serious matter, but it is not clear what sort of reaction Solondz is trying to elicit here. The scenes with father and son discussing masturbation were met with stony faced silence and a few embarrassed sniggers in the audience with which I was sitting: There must be more to black comedy than mere taboo breaking? On the whole though, the rest of the film is funny and well-made, and succeeds because the characters are recognisably human, something which Neil LaBute should take note of after the depressingly unamusing misanthropy of \u0091Your Friends and Neighbours'. Aside from a few instances where it just goes too far, \u0091Happiness' is an entertaining film, but I'd like to believe that this \u0091schadenfreude' approach to comedy is going to soon run out of mileage.",

It has been listed on many \"disturbing\" movie lists, but the only thing really disturbing about it are its themes: Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Allen, a loner who is only aroused by crank-calling random women and telling them what he wants to do to them, whilst pleasuring himself; Dylan Baker plays a seemingly happily married man who secretly lusts for boys, mostly his son's friends. Baker is brilliant: Every expression on his face tells a story, and he manages to engender empathy, because we are lured into looking at the world through his eyes.The main problem with the film is that, for all the lurid sub-plots, there is not nearly enough dramatic tension: Loose ends abound, and no character really has a satisfying end to their story arc.Given that most of the characters are connected in some way, much more could have been made of this script to heighten the suspense: Instead, we have a series of episodes that never really tie together.However, for the acting itself, I give this one 6/10.",

This movie takes you places you know you want to go but would never venture. Truly unique is this movie and the fact that Jon Lovitz and Phillip Seymour Hoffman are in the same feature, even for a second, make the movie outrageous! This movie is a trip for one to go on and it's kind of hard to explain. The dialog is incredibly realistic and the problems are realistic but the kind of things people just don't talk about. Todd has this interesting view of the suburbs which I can truly appreciate (having grown up in the suburbs.)The last 30 minutes of the movie I won't give away. But I will say this, in a scene between a father and his son, and everything after that... watching that just had something SNAP for me. Something about the suburbs just looks different after seeing this, and you'll never think of people's families the same way. After watching that, it was just sooo good and sooo interesting and yet so kinda sad and still funny that your like WOW. It's like I didn't know I had the ability to mix emotions and nostalgia so well and weirdly until now. Definitely watch this movie.

This one never showed up at the theatres here (Arkansas) because of its ludicrous NC-17 rating, but I kept it in the back of my mind and held out for the video with stupendous results. This next effort after Solondz's fine A DOLL'S HOUSE is simply a masterpiece. I watched it alone at first and was then inspired enough to invite a mutually film savvy friend to see it with me. He was jaw-droppingly awed. This film is not for filmgoers who simply watch movies for entertainment. HAPPINESS is fine art. While it may be disturbing and depressing, that doesn't negate its fine script and story interplay. The fact that one of the film's characters is a pederast is hardly relevant as far as the film's MPAA rating is concerned. That character could have easily been rewritten into someone with a less disturbing problem. He is simply there to add strength to the film's argument. What is the film trying to say? That, IMHO, many of us in America are so befuddled, selfish, and/or dysfunctional that we are wholly unfit to make choices about what's in our best interest, about how to attain true happiness. Instead we go seeking with our off-kelter minds what we think will make us happy only to end up ruined, because true individual happiness stems not from short-term gratification and desires, but takes long and hard thought about who and what we are. First Know Thyself. Then Fix Thyself. And if you can't objectively know yourself or seriously help yourself, ask someone or seek help. While the pederast did seek help, his problem was such that willpower was not enough. He needed serious help. Even so, I can understand why this film wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea. If you didn't like it, that is, of course, fine. But some of us were able to glean a most serious message from HAPPINESS. Not that we didn't already know the message, but that the message needed to be raised and kicked over, as do most issues from time to time. So, we look at a film like HAPPINESS and WE are reminded of that which we'd rather keep hidden or rather forget, but that is only to our detriment.\n9/10",

People looking for personal happiness, mostly through sexual gratification and, for the most part, miserably failing.Helen, is a gorgeus writer who feels she lacks authenticity, Trish is a housewife who unknowingly has her own share of dark secrets in the family closet. The characters are real and alone with their urges and many needs and they're  depicted very realistically battling with their many needs, wishes and insecurities. The fact is that  people portrayed in this film really do exist. Probably each of us shares some sort of deviation or a sexual predilection, the motley crew of the film's characters is quite credible. The vanities, the sillyness, the lack of control over one's own life and circumstances is universal amongst members of humanity. Yet this obsessive strife for happiness, and ease is often leading us to greater unhappiness and unease. Imperative for happiness, especially happiness without content, instant gratification is the illness of the modern man. And this condition Todd Solondz presents in this funny, intelligent film with fine control, style and competence. He firmly holds all the different threads in his grip, and even manages to portray the Russian crook played by Jared Harris, and his family with such correspondence to reality. Brilliant film about the nonsensicalities of human existence...uplifting.",

It's hard to tell whether he has much use for the whole perverted lot but he does let his actors shine, most notably Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Jane Adams, Cynthia Stevenson and a very, very brave Dylan Baker; the ensemble cast brings a certain amount of sympathy with them even when Solonz is subverting them with cruel, calculated dialogue. The problem is that there may not be much more to the material worth noting than its inherent shock value. You're disturbed while you're watching but when it's over, you feel more like you've been entertained. The manipulation leaves you feeling sullied and a little ashamed.

Surely everything there is to be said about this film is already said in the 340 comments made before this one - therefore I'll just try to somewhat summarize my own feelings about the movie and try to analyze a bit why it is so controversial..;) Don't worry - I'm not turning this to Psychology lesson (I am not a humanist! :) (at least in that way that I'd study or practice psychology, philosophy, history etc..)For me this movie seemed actually quite boring - there really wasn't really any story or plot, which are essential to me. Because really - if there isn't a plot to a film then what's the point? Nothing, it's just a bunch of stuff that happens (that they show to us) - for no reason. Of course one might argue that the point of this film is to criticize the very human nature, but so what? We all know (hopefully) what it is and after taking that away from the movie - what's left? Nothing.. Ok, there is good acting but I think that good acting is a prerequisite for a good movie, not something that would transform a hollow movie into a good one.It's also a very linear movie: practically everything the characters are thinking is laid out for you to see and as a result, there are very few surprises and things that make you think - Another reason why I thought it was boring, since there is no room for your mind to wander: this is how it is and that's final - sounds like a High School teacher..:)\nOk, let's summarize: Happiness is a disturbing, but boring film. The main reason that I thought it wasn't good is that there really is no story to tell. What I think is the reason that so many people have praised it is that the the ideas are laid out very easily - it's like \"disturbing pictures for dummies\" and as empirical tests have shown: the majority of people are dummies. (ok I know I'm going to receive loads of hatemail for that one, but Even our old friend Albert Einstein said that in the Universe there are only two things that are infinite: the Universe itself and human's capability to be ignorant. And he wasn't even sure about the Universe..) Besides there are a lot of films that deal with similar (disturbing) subjects (sex, human behaviour) with much more style (and a good story), such as: Dr. Strangelove, Clockwork Orange, Twelve monkeys, Tokyo fist, Thesis, Braindead (this one at least made me laugh), 8mm, Audition and so on... (I think all those movies were better than Happiness)One thing: I didn't say that the movie was all bad, actually it was ok, not excellent and a bit boring - that's all. And also it could be (and most probably in some of your opinion is) that I simply didn't get it, but I can't see how I could have missed it. (Since in my own opinion, I got all those movies I mentioned above and they all seem harder than this one).Thanks for your interest in my thoughts, Max.",

Loosely, it follows a dysfunctional family through a variety of perverse situations.  There's a lot of masturbation, as well as other types of scenes played for shock value, and lots of twists and turns to the plot. There's also some incredibly good acting and directing.However, the director, Todd Solondz,  didn't seem to quite know whether to play this film for comedy or pathos and most of it is not funny, just sick and depressing.  It moves too slow and is too long and even though the characters are interesting, they're cardboard cartoon sorry versions of human beings.  Like other recent independent films, small parts are played by name people --Ben Gazarra, Louise Lasser and Marla Maples. None of their performances are noteworthy.  However, the rest of the cast is excellent.Interesting, but not memorable, and certainly not for everyone.",

Superficial people leading superficial lives. Several of the characters had  glimpses of insight into their situation, but clammed right back up.

            "content": "Todd Solondz' film HAPPINESS, like his previous film WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE, is largely about people dealing with the dichotomy of who they actually are and who they feel they should be.  However, HAPPINESS is a greater film than DOLLHOUSE, not necessarily for any glaring reasons beyond the fact that Solondz himself is improving in the writing and directing departments.  HAPPINESS, though, decides to take a grand scope where DOLLHOUSE was focused on one character, and does it so effortlessly that the scenes dealing with the film's three or four stories flow together, almost making us forget how large the number of people and ideas we're supposed to be keeping up with is.  Be forewarned, though: HAPPINESS is a dark tale of people who are uncomfortable and who must deal with situations that may seem very disturbing and in bad taste at first, but a discerning  (and experienced) viewer will find moments of tremendous emotional exposition and touching humanity amidst the father and son who talk nonchlantly, almost sportingly, about masturbation and pedophilia (a topic in which Solondz' insight far exceeds the overrated AMERICAN BEAUTY); the young computer tech obsessed with the idea of tying his beautiful neighbor up and performing grandiose, unspeakable sexual acts on her; the other neighbor who can't stop talking about Pedro -- the doorman -- and his severed penis.  Despite that, HAPPINESS, I promise, is a comedy.  \"KINGPIN\" it ain't, but there are moments of completely unpredictable consequence and surprise that will have you cracking up in the face of the bleakest human activity imaginable.  Most of all, HAPPINESS is, like Paul Thomas Anderson's somewhat similar and equally brilliant MAGNOLIA, the story of people who just can't stand to be alone or outcast; it is the story of the world, a place where everybody just wants to fit in, to find someone, and to be happy.  \"To happiness!\"",

Yet, I've rented it multiple times and have watched it with people because it's one of those films that, to me, is only worth watching again just to see the reactions of those who you are watching it with.I've always described this movie as a Family Drama gone to hell.  It feels as if you are watching something like Eight is Enough, or Family, or perhaps one of those wretched Lifetime Women's Movie you see on cable (it even stars Cynthia Stevenson who has been in quite a few Lifetime productions)..yet, somehow, it's much more honest than we really want to believe.We are seeing people as they truly see themselves before reality comes crashing in on then.  Even then, some of them just go on like before because they want to believe they are happier than everyone else.It's funny because Todd Solondz creates a Family Drama atmosphere with chirpy music and swelling love-theme music (as when Dr. Maplewood sees Billy's friend and falls completely entranced) during events that either we just see as plain wrong, or they hit so much close to the truth for some people, it causes discomfort and makes them want to turn the TV off or critique it because they don't know what else to do with it.Someone called this \"Liberal Hipster\" crap.  Ironically, Pedophilia is more relevant than ever now with the recent events in the news..but the men who are commiting this act are associated with conservative organizations.  So again, maybe this is hitting a little too close to the truth than many people would like to admit.One way or another, this movie will either make you laugh, make you shout at the screen \"This is just wrong!,\" make you cry or maybe all at the same time.  Fortunately, with \"Happiness\", all those reactions are warranted and exactly what this movie is trying to elicit.",

Sure, it's disturbing, and that's the point. It also effortlessly weaves multiple storylines into one movie (only \"Magnolia\" is better at handling the multiple plots, though I still slightly prefer \"Happiness\" on the whole).The performances in this movie are simply brilliant. My personal favorite was Cynthia Stevenson as one of those typical housewives with 2.5 kids and a carpool. Her character was so obnoxious, superficial and condescending - she clearly did a wonderful job. Philip Seymour Hoffman also deserves praise. He is so incredibly versatile - he successfully made my skin crawl here. Louise Lasser is simply wonderful. You can see the despair on her face in every scene that she's in. I was also a huge fan of Camryn Manheim (what a twist!), Lara Flynn Boyle (she gives new meaning to the role of the phony snob), Dylan Baker, Jane Adams, Elizabeth Ashley, and Molly Shannon's cameo which was HYSTERICAL. And the child actors...simply brilliant and such difficult material.The movie makes me feel completely numb and empty when it's over, but I cannot get over just how amazing it is.

            "content": "There is a moment midway through Todd Solondz' third feature Happiness in which one of the characters chastises herself as nothing but a 'sordid exhibitionist'.  The same charge could and indeed probably still will be laid at the door of the film's director, given the fact that his movie includes graphic scenes of paedophilia, rape and masturbation over its 2 hour runtime.  Remarkably though, the picture steers well clear of gratuitous exhibitionism and is a resounding success, bolstered by a string of fine performances and assured, superbly paced direction.  Happiness is built to shock, but is simultaneously a beautifully observed and subtle piece that is as thought-provoking as it is grim and ghastly.It seems pointless to say that this is not a film for everyone, but this should be reiterated and attempted comparisons to Sam Mendes' American Beauty are inevitable but futile.  That work is an excellent piece in its own right, but Happiness takes place in a world eons from that of Lester Burnham. Replace fluttering plastic bags with machine gun massacre daydreams and drugged child molesting and you're halfway there.  Solondz populates his film with an array of unsavoury characters who continuously find themselves in situations bordering on the unbearable for the viewer, scenarios that are often more compulsive than repulsive.  The camera is allowed to roam between storylines in an approach that is never disorientating, retaining a sharp focus on the repugnant details that lurk behind the smiling suburban exterior.The ensemble cast is pitched to perfection, with the child actors deserving a special mention for some astounding acting in the face of supremely difficult material.  Amongst the more senior members, Dylan Baker and the ubiquitous Phillip Seymour Hoffman offer mature and controlled performances in two of the movie's most fascinating developments.  Proper credit should also be given to the costume and make-up department, as somehow these characters just look exactly right in their visual appearance.  Add to these carefully nuanced protagonists and inspired use of music and it's clear that this is not a work of exploitative exhibitionism.Even if this film had been a noble failure it would have been a notable moment in cinema history.  The fact that it is a set in stone masterpiece means that its impact is redoubled.  As the multi-layered narrative weaves it way from one uncomfortable moment to the next, one question keeps repeating in your mind; how the hell did this ever get made?  Forget that though, and just enjoy the fact that it did, because moments of sunshine are often all too rare, a fact emphasised throughout this film.  Happiness might be a different beast altogether, but it's certainly an American beauty; I challenge you not to be uplifted by as satisfying an ending as I can remember.",

On the most sentimental level for me, it is an excellent portrayal of New Jersey and what makes it tick. Todd Solondz grew up a few towns away from me, and it captures the damaged perfectionism and subtle, quirky lunacy of New Jersey, and also its perverse beauty, more than any movie I can think of (Garden State says nothing about my home state.) It is not for the squeamish, but it bursts through the issues with excellent acting, and it is meant to make the viewer really think about their preconceptions. Besides child molestation, the most talked-about controversial subject in Happiness, Solondz also rips through pretentious artists, divorce and the depression of the elderly, immigration, and everything about romance and rejection.

Its script is very unique; it is very well written and manages to find humour in the darkest and most unexpected places. I say \"humour\" but I don't really know if that is the right term. It is not laugh out loud funny; the humour is all very subtle and indirect and isn't created through jokes or situations but is rather created in how the situation is played out. At times I even found myself laughing out of awkwardness and there are many times when I wasn't sure weather to laugh or not.The film is structured in a way that it tells several separate but interwoven stories, which are all shocking and unusual, 'Happiness is probably the most anti-mainstream film I have ever seen. Acting is great especially when you conceder just how difficult the majority of the roles must be to play. Dylan Baker impressed me the most as there are very few actors I think would be brave enough to take that role, just watch the film and you will soon understand why.'Happiness' is a difficult film to love, as I don't think there is anyone who could watch and not find it to be disturbing, but don't let that hold it back. Todd Solondz, is a talented and daring director who isn't afraid to put himself out there and make a film that is going to draw in a lot of negativity.

With this one scene, I forgave Todd for \"Dollhouse\" and went on to enjoy 2-plus hours of wonderfully dark humor! Unlike the open cruelty of \"Dollhouse\", \"Happiness\" presents its characters in a sympathetic light, and while it lets its characters have their small victories, they're neither forced or compromised attempts to please the audience.

There are no one-liners, no sophomoric gross-outs, no pie sex! To be sure, there is some brilliant deadpan delivery of the wise and witty script. Thank goodness for the brief flashes of humor! Never in my experience was 'comic relief' so bitter and yet so welcome, sort of like a glass of clamato just before you die of thirst. The parade of bare humanity cast with a painter's eye affords some relief, but a comedy?? NO. Happiness is a gut-punch. If you don't like to be challenged, stay at home; don't rent it, read People. Otherwise, gird thyself, you will be left reeling. Guaranteed. Why? Are masturbation, pedophilia, dismemberment and self-loathing that shocking?  Well...yes actually, and all the more so when presented so unflinchingly, with honesty and without gratuity. No gratuity you say? Is it necessary to show/say the things Solondz shows and says? Sounds like the age-old problem of evil to me. Oh, I know you'd rather extrapolate a 'dark side' from some candy-coated nonsense, a Snidely Whiplash who clearly posits himself 'below' you on your tidy moral scale. It isn't so easy to feel superior when your most private moments, your deepest fears and anxieties are projected for everyone to see. How can you face the row behind you after THAT? Quick! Get up and leave the theatre! NOW!  Otherwise someone might think you actually enjoyed it! See I'm a cynic too, and that's why I know this brilliant piece of film is wasted on the general population. It's too frank, too brutal.  There is precious little happiness here. Most viewers will undoubtedly turn away too soon. Anyone expecting to see \"real happiness\" will leave as unsatisfied as the kids who sneaked in the theater to see \"Naked Lunch\".  Though I propose this IS real happiness.  Nobody gets a break, but most will continue on, wow, just like 'real life'. Bottom line IMHO.

Though the characters' predicaments create humor and amazement by being slightly over the top at times, there's a deeply haunting ring of truth in all their experiences. In fact, as I chuckled to myself while viewing the film, I would frequently wonder if I should be laughing at all. These things happen to people; they happen in our society. And the emotional pain they create is no laughing matter. There has been controversy regarding one of the characters who has a disdainful, even repugnant sexual proclivity. But Solondz doesn't judge his players. He presents them as they are, for better or worse, and lets the viewer wrestle with judgmental conclusions.

When I saw it available for rent, I gave it a try, and wasn't disappointed.This is one film where you'll be laughing out loud, then also covering your face with your hands when horrified by some of the scenes. You aren't horrified by the graphics, but by its content. The scenes with the father/son chat about not able to come, very original. It makes fun of the hollywood cliche of father/son chats, by talking about something completely out of left field.This is one of the darkest comedy/dramas that I've ever seen so far. The sad truth is, this is also reality. The pedophile, the thief, the loser phone pranker, the lonely neighbor, the artist.. dark truths of what really does happen in society here in the states. Get it, but this isn't for people with the faint heart or easily shocked.",

Anyway, this movie is my latest, and probably all time record. Complete waste of time. This movie has no purpose whatsoever, the stories told in it are rather uninspired and uninteresting. There's one or two details that made me laugh or appreciate it, but all in all, this movie doesn't worth a minute of attention. My attention at least. I'm not easily shocked, or have any problems with \"heavy\" themed movies, but this one is, i repeat, a waste of time.Seeing this movie didn't contribute whatsoever for my life. I didn't take nothing useful out of it, not even entertainment or appreciation for the cinematography. NOTHING. Sure, there are a LOT of unhappy people, a lot of disturbed people and a lot of problematic people. That's what i got from the movie. As if i didn't know that already.*thumbs down*",

At the very least, Todd Solondz plugs into this moment with a film that portrays the obsessive quest for fulfillment through sex as desperate and pathetic. \nDoes Solondz feel anything for his lost, lonely souls, who include an obese murderess and a child molester only vaguely aware of the damage he causes? The movie does project pity and horror for these people, but in a way that's wan and tentative - as if Solondz shares his characters' inability to let go with their emotions. In one post-coitum triste scene, a woman tells her ineffectual lover, \"Don't feel guilty.\" \"I don't feel guilty,\" he answers. \"I don't feel anything.\"Happiness is a very bleak movie. You'd have to go back to an artist like Nathanel West (who wrote Miss Lonelyhearts and Day of the Locust) for a vision of North American life that's as unsparing and uncompromising. Like West, Solondz can make you laugh in the wasteland that he drops you into, but the giggles catch in your throat. For feel good black comedy, go elsewhere",

            "content": "Definitely a hit of the nineties! This film pulls out all the stops for shocking its audience without showing any gratuitous violence and fully deserves the critical acclaim it has received after winning the Cannes film festival in 1998.Happiness is a real life story about the lives of several members of the community including Bill a therapist in therapy himself ironically enough, Allen a data-resources employee struggling with self esteem and approaching the apple of his eye troubled writer Helen who seems to spend the film searching for authenticity to her books. Helen's family are parallel to the storyline as they each seem to have their own unique storyline except sister Trish who is married to Bill with 3 children and 'Happiness' lying within, or is it. Because we all know that a relationship can't function properly when people keep secrets from one another.The central characters in this film seem to be the ones with the biggest problems. Throughout, we search for search for a hardened protagonist but fail to idealise with the purer characters. The characters we tend to associate to are the darker more intense characters sticking closely by their side as we become more and more deeply involved in their troubled psyche. The lighter characters invent little room for relief with an explosive amount of sex, murder, frustration and battery.\nThe film focuses around issues which some people have to deal with throughout life. Although these are sometimes portrayed in a humorous way the film admits itself to very little outcry of laughter. The black comedy causes us to see the film as funny but accept this humour as at its most heavy introverted and ironic caused by typical flaws of hard hitting stereotypical behaviour. Topics that are often avoided within the film industry and even life no longer lie dormant in this masterpiece. The film deals with such issues as rape, paedophilia and sexual perversion concentrating on creating a sense a fusion between the audience and the perpetrators of these usually senselessly horrific offences.\nThere are a lot of things I could say about 'Happiness' but to sum up its a master crafted piece of pure magnificence. I would recommend this to anyone mature enough to cope with the very real issues involved, mind you the subject matter is not for all and carries a burden for those not open to sexual obscenity.Overall I give 'Happiness' a classic and I must say well earned:5 out of 5",

There are some disturbing and shocking scenes because they're never shown on TV (except for There's Something About Mary), but it's real - everything you see here is real. Several flaws such as little contrived scenes and there are a number of plots and most which are never resolved leaving the viewers hanging. But Dylan Baker's character, which people complained never had anything bad happen to him at the end, can be figured out without the director telling us what happened. This is a clearly perfect, a great film - only for the art crowd and smart guys like Todd Solondz - it's something I can't bear to hate. Rarely does a film make me feel what Happiness made me feel. It's more feel-good than Stepmom was and the hysterical moments are caught here. Another thing, the title is just irony...nobody is happy here, or they think they are and just want to be.",

I hope the child actor in the film isnt disturbed later on, because the material he had was inappropriate and to me bordered on abuse. How many of us asked our parents about cumming , and how we can acheive that goal? Did you run to the dinner table to inform your mother and the rest of the family that you came for the first time?

For example, it has been touched on by some astute individuals that provocativeness does not makes something intellectual or interesting; also that the dialog is unrealistic and the plot devices contrived, robbing this film of any value as commentary on any real phenomena or situation. I also agree with the person who said that Jon Lovitz's brief role at the beginning is about the only good thing about this movie, but even that can't raise this movie above a rock-bottom awful rating. Even the brilliantly talented Philip Seymour Hoffman is a waste in this movie, treading no new ground and playing the most generic, one-dimensional, uninteresting role in the long line of misfits and weirdos he has portrayed during his career.This movie is not art. It is crap. Trainspotting was provocative and at times repugnant, and it was a great work of art, but it was not by virtue of being provocative and repugnant that it was art. I hesitate to even make comparisons between a waste of 2 hours of people's lives like Happiness and a classic like Trainspotting, but I will make a couple of brief ones. In Trainspotting you have deep, rich characterization, the foundation for which is laid out in the screenplay and then is fleshed out by the actors. Though on the surface a story about depraved drug addicts, it also transcends that to become a thought piece on the human condition, and the realism and believability of the story are what allow it access to this higher ground. In Happiness the characters are merely cardboard cutouts there to enact the writer/director's aimless sicko fantasies, which are neither interesting pieces of imagination nor believable scenarios, and provide the viewer with nothing of any interest to ponder. The portrayals are 1 dimensional, and it seems hard to blame the actors since even someone of Hoffman's abilities can extract little from the script.To borrow a phrase from Spinal Tap, \"the artistic level of this movie cannot be charted. It is treading water in a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry\".",

One moment you're watching \"Mary Hartman\" in a nice scene then...wham...pedophila.The most amazing thing about this movie, for me anyway, was the director's refusal to condemn the pedophile in question (although it would take some ridiculously off track reasoning to think the film approves of him in any way, shape, or form.)  Solndz lets you think what you want, which takes cojones of steel.  Brilliant, but very, very, VERY warped.",

The title is supposed to be ironic, as none of the characters could be described in any way as happy: neurotic, depressed, and perverted all come to mind, but never 'happy'. Rather than go into detail about the plot or detail, I'd prefer to discuss the reasons i disliked this film.Firstly, its so obviously trying to be shocking or provocative, one character is a paedophile, another makes obscene phone calls, there are several masturbation scenes, etc. Secondly, the film just offers up these characters and their actions without comment, which, compared to the kind of blatant moralizing that most hollywood films seem to be so fond of should come as a relief, instead it seemed to me that Solondz's goal was to lead the audience into identifying with characters, in order that they may be more thoroughly appalled by the characters actions later on.As I said, the apparent absence of moralizing should come as a relief, but instead this film just left me feeling empty and sad.  Yes, it did make me think, but mostly it made me think about how I already know there are sad and sick people in the world, and that I don't need some pretentious director/writer to tell me that paedophiles are people too. The popularity of this film seems to rest on its willingness to deal with controversial issues.  However, it seems to me that by refusing to address the events depicted on any moral grounds whatsoever, this film ends up saying nothing at all.",

None of it felt remotely genuine or based on life experience in any way - completely  contrived.

Who is Joy Jordan if not Dawn Wiener (from \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\") grown up?  What is the audience intended to take away from this film? That life sucks?

I think that the volume of user comments here will attest to that fact. Anyway, my personal opinion is that Happiness was one of the best films of 1998. I thought that it was hilarious. Yes it was also disturbing but at its core Happiness is a comedy. At any rate \"Happiness\" is much much better than the similarly structured \"Playing by Heart,\" which, although it was a much warmer and brighter film than Happiness, was one of the most mind numbingly insipid things I saw all year. I thought all of the performances in \"Happiness\" were fantastic. Dylan Baker was particularly noteworthy as the \"model\" father and husband who is secretly a pedaphile. The scenes between Baker and his son (particularly the last one) were amazing. Philip Seymore Hoffman (who I think is hands down one of the best actors working today) is fantastic as a chronic loser who gets off on making obscene phone calls. My one complaint about the film is that Hoffman's character should have been given more screen time.  Camryn Manheim (\"The Practice\") is great in a small but memorable role as Hoffman's neighbor who has a secret in her fridge. I realize that this film is not for everyone, but I think it's fantastic and would have to recommend it. I would have to provide a word of caution though. Don't see this film on a first date. In fact don't see this film on any date, unless you are VERY confident in the strength of your relationship. Also, try to remember that this is a comedy. You'll probably feel dirty for wanting to laugh at this film, but go ahead and laugh anyway. Trust me, it's funny.One more thing: \"Happiness\" has the best last line of any movie I've seen in a long long time.",

This film is incredibly mean-spirited, badly paced, and makes little use of its highly-talented cast, with such brilliant actors as Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Louise Lasser.  Mr. Solondz obviously thought he was creating a work of art by assembling this sordid tale, complete with serial rape, spousal abuse, and a woman who chops up her doorman's genitals and stores them in a refrigerator. What bothers me is not the nature of these crimes and their respective severity, but how Mr. Solondz's direction tries to play them off as everyday occurrences that are better laughed at then dealt with seriously.

Filmmakers such as Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kramer, George Lucas, and Steven Spielberg are all examples of this.  Todd Solondz, however, is not. And as much as the critics today would like to try and make him be, he comes far short. Despite all the critical acclaim this movie is getting, it is in reality a big waste of time.  A film that pushes the envelope strictly to push the envelope; but overall not really saying anything, and leaving the audience (I can speak for myself, my friends, and many people at the theatre I was at who were noticeably taken aback) alienated and disgusted. The story - there isn't really a plot - centres around the lives of three sisters, and follow them and the men around them through many strange and perverse sexual episodes.  Whether it's the paedophile, the paedophile's son who is obsessed with making himself ejaculate, the \"wham-bam-thank-u-mam\" guy, or the guy who harasses women on the phone while masturbating, this movie has it all (Including the \"money shot\" in the masturbating scene). Well, does all this say anything?  About the realities of life?  Or the illusions about these topics?  Not really.  It says about what we would expect it to say.  That paedophiles are bad people and sex fiends are deprived people.  But the subject matter was treated very coldly through most of the film, with only occasional moments where I could see past these exteriors to the actual people and try to feel for them.  But overall I just felt pushed away and I found myself anxious to leave after the first 90 of the 134 mins.  Oh yeah, and it was way too damn long. Now, I do have to say a good word about the acting.  Some of the performances where very good.  I was particularly interested in the relationship between Philip Seymour Hoffman (Twister, Boogie Nights), and Camryn Manheim (Bonfire of the Vanities, TV's The Practice), which by the end became a desperate need for companionship despite the events surrounding their lives in that tiny New Jersey apartment.  And Dylan Baker was haunting as paedophile father Bill Maplewood, who ends up preying on his sons' friends.  He was sickening and disturbing to watch. Now, I know you may be thinking, if the movie is this affecting, doesn't mean it is doing something?  No, about the only thing it does is sicken and disgust you.  It just seems like a personal project that he put together to see how far he could take things.  I see nothing genius or extraordinary about this movie.  It plays to the lowest common denominator.  If this movie actually ends up speaking to you on some higher level, you may want to see a psychiatrist.",

Or what to think of a call center (the crappy job of the decade) employee who ends up in bed with one guy just for one night (whereas she expected a true connection). Or her sister, part of a so-called happy family, but who's husband is a pathetic pervert. In alle, the film wonderfully (great acting, good dialogue) and successfully investigates our notion of happiness: isn't it all a charade, or is it just so, and are our expectations to high?

Now, I'll tell you why.'Happiness' is a (very) black comedy that finds humour in the most desperate of human struggles. I won't go into the detail of what these struggles are but I will say that they are some considered pretty despicable by most. As well as these their are other, more subtle psychological problems, which are shown to great effect in the name of a plot that will move the viewer, but in a very different way from usual.The beauty of 'Happiness' is its lack of disgust. It's the kind of thing that shallow minds write letters to the government to ban. In the lack of a prejudiced and conservative eye, 'Happiness' gives a very real sense of the people that would otherwise be portrayed as despicable baddies. Another reviewer wrote here that he never thought he could sympathise with a paedophile until he saw 'Happiness', and I feel this sums the film's greatest quality up well. With its interesting wit and deeply probing insights, 'Happiness' causes the viewer to feel the pains and pleasures (and even more particular states) of its quietly desperate characters.It's impressive how such a film can remain funny, but 'Happiness' does even in areas where one may not believe humour has a place. Not to give too much away, the 'facts of life' type conversations between a father and son I find particularly amusing - although it's worth pointing out that they're not conducted in the over used awkward and stuttered way that most movie makers favour.If you want to see a truly different, and deeply engaging film that will leave you with a deeper understanding of humanity - 'Happiness' is for you.",

            "content": "Todd Solondz and David Lynch have one thing in common: they're both often called perverts. Lynch, for his film 'Blue Velvet and Solondz for his fantastically original film 'Happiness' . The film takes your typical[and not so typical] losers, perverts and ordinary people and rotates them around so at one point, we may be touched at the characters plight and at the next, we laugh as the movie pokes vicious, biting fun at them. This is quite similar to what Lynch did in 'Blue Velvet'. In fact, 'Happiness' is almost like the twisted second cousin of 'Blue Velvet'. Solondz places many homages to Lynch's film[The hallways in an apartment complex seem to have an electric hum; the basic theme of perversions under suburbia] but Solondz goes more in the direction of satire directed at people who could be your next-door neighbor.The film is like a more perverted version of 'Magnolia': It takes a group of several people and follows their lives. But while 'Magnolia' dealt with ordinary people with big problems,' Happiness' deals with people who  may be and are problems to society. To give examples: One character is a pedophile and, in the course of the film, does rape some children[OFFSCREEN];Another is a fat loser, played brilliantly by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who makes obscene phone calls and then masturbates, An eleven-year old, obsessed with masturbation himself[ leading to one of the best final lines of any movie ever]. And of course, the perpetually euphoric woman named 'Joy' who's life is a hopeless mess. Solondz though, turns the tables on these possibly unpleasant people. He takes them, makes us feel sympathy for them, than brutally makes fun of them. Some hated the film for this: how can you make fun of people while at the same time try to identify with them. But Solondz manages just that. He seems to be see them one way, rotates the microscope, and then sees them in a totally different light. This contrast actually helps us to identify with the characters more, because we see them in so many different lights, we know more about them and can therefore feel for them. Through the course of the film, we get involved in everyone's plight, several of which are howlingly funny.Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character has an obsession with the woman next door[Lara Flynn Boyle]. He fantasizes of having sex with her and even raping her. But he knows, because he is so meek, it could never come true. One night, when he phoning  up people to give them obscene messages, he phones the neighbor. She is turned on by his sexual ravings. She wants more. Using auto-redial[''I've had you on auto-redial all night.''] she begins to phone him so many times he unplugs the phone. She finds out his work phone-number, leading to one of the best lines in the movie;[Hoffman]''What do you want?''[Boyle] ''I want you to F#$@ ME!''[Hoffman, nearly crying] ''I don't think I can do that.''Solondz has just taken a characters perversions, turned them on him, and made vicious fun of a potentially sick situation. This repeats itself all through the movie, contrating with several  emotionally powerful moments as when the father confesses his rape of one of his son's friends to a boy. He answers all the boy's questions, no matter how tough they get. I find it truly amazing that Solondz manages to find a balance and make this an UPLIFTING [Sort of] movie instead of turning it into something unpleasant.A truly Remarkable accomplishmentThis film is not for everyone[ it went out unrated because the MPAA rated it NC-17 and that can mean bad business for any film]. But, for people who are open-minded and willing to see a movie that is really something to admire instead of the usual Hollywood crap, I highly recommend it.............10/10.",

Even the most obnoxious of men take advantage of her, she gets abused by everyone she tries to be nice to, her \"successful\" sisters are shooting poisonous darts into her oh-my-gosh-thirty-and-unmarried heart, and so on and so forth. She's sad, but she's still nice to everyone, and she does learn one thing or two along the way.

I thought I had seen some movies with disturbing content, but I don't think I've ever seen anything this disturbing.  Some of the scenes were very uncomfortable to watch.  I was by myself and I felt like fastforwarding through some scenes. When I'm by myself I'll see a lot of nudity sex and cursing in movies and I don't even notice it.  But this movie doesn't even have much cursing and barely any nudity and it was very disturbing.  I guess it was a combination of very good acting and taboo subjects.  I found the conversations with the boy and his father the hardest to watch just because that doesn't seem like anything a father should say to his son.  And there are several masterbation scenes which you don't really want to see.  I know almost everyone masterbates, but I don't care to see cum in motion pictures.  OH GOD! The last scene in the movie I was laughing and simultaneously disgusted! You think Stifler drinking the beer with it in it is bad and the famous scene from Something about Mary was bad, but I think the last scene in this movie is worse! UGHHH! I don't know if I can place a number to rate this movie. The acting was good and I wanted to see how the movie ended, but I don't know if I can recommmend a movie I can barely watch myself.  It was interesting I suppose, but some of the dialogue was brutally slow.  There would be talking then long pauses between the characters.  I would have liked to have seen more of a conclusion of what happened to the pedofile physchiatrist if he went to jail or if the kids father beat him up or killed him.  I think Philip Seymour Hoffman was the best in this movie.  I think he's one of the best actors of our time and I hope he gets roles in many future movies.  Ok after reading this if you aren't scared away then I recommend this movie.  What the hell I'll give it a rating 6.5/10.",

It takes as it's subject matter the underbelly of family life, the tension, self-deceit and anguish we all experience in different ways but presents them in a cool almost detached way which is unsettling and challenging. The setting is middle-America, which has never seemed less appealing, and a group of characters who do not elicit sympathy and include one whose behaviour in cinema is generally portrayed as monstrous. His behaviour is monstrous but all the more believable because it is presented in such an understated way, such people do not appear monstrous in their everyday lives. The distance employed by the director forces us to form moral judgements, he does not tell us how we should react but allows space which made very me conscious of my role as observer. It is also very funny at times but here too there is uncertainty, should I really be laughing at this? This is a difficult film to judge but to me it rang true, behind every family there are dark truths we would rather others did not see.

The other sisters have no more luck - one is 'happily' married to a closet pederast (hence why this is also quite a serious and disturbing film, although the subject matter is dealt with excellently), the other is a stunning but hopelessly self-obsessed young 'poet' who is stalked by her obsessive next-door neighbour.What makes this movie clever is how the lives of the characters are interconnected, but they never realise it - for instance, the obsessive neighbour sees a psychiatrist, who happens to be the paedophile married to the other sister. It came across to me as an 'American Beauty'-style commentary on modern life and repressed sexual desires, but however you view it it's a funny, entertaining but also very confrontational film - I don't think I've ever seen the topic of child molesting discussed so frankly in a movie before.",

Where \"American Beauty\" had something strange but still sympathetic, this one has got nothing. It is just a picture of the scum of some sick and frustrated dude's mind, the picture the director is painting here is worse than the most perverted mind could ever imagine. That movie doesn't do any good in any way. The only thing one has to admit is the incredible sickness and unhappiness, the incredible frustration that the characters of that story live in, and how that is brought to the viewer by the movie. But it still was one of the most awful movies I've ever seen in my whole life, and that comes from a guy who loved \"twin peaks\", \"american beauty\", and most admired the brutality of schindler's list, because at least in that movie there was a sense, the sense of showing people how to make the future better than the past, but \"Happiness\" erases all hope to make anything better, it's just a story of a bunch of people facing nothing but the absolute bottom of social life, and a director who himself seems to enjoy stirring in human excrement up to the very last detail.My respect to the actors, though.

He presents his subject matter to the audience with extreme lucidity and a detached coolness which makes this film all the more disquieting to watch.Each character in their own unique way are deluded by their desire to become 'happy'. This is where Solondz works the ironic motif of the title into his narrative: in their efforts to attain 'happiness', they become more aware of their own loneliness and alienation within the world which only serves them to sink deeper into depression. There exists different degrees of self-disillusionment through this charged web of misfits which dot the landscapes of suburbanite/urbanite America. One example being the perverted computer guy who masturbates on the phone to women; he is one who is resigned to defeat and appears somewhat dignified in his evident lack of desire to attain 'happiness'. Whereas on the opposite end of the spectrum, we are given more complex character studies: the housewife who's 'got it all' yet she really has nothing; her paedophilic husband who has a fetish for his son's friends; and the author who seems to be the film's 'winner', yet we soon become aware that she is it's biggest loser. These characters are made all the more depraved in the sense that they hide under this veneer of middle-class normality and respectability, yet they are the very epitome of all things abject. It is through his characters' duplicity that Solondz is able to convey a caustic critique of social decay.His depiction, though unsettling, confronts you with a reality that you want so much to deny but are not able to. \"Happiness\" is one of the best examples of how the cinema can function as a cathartic outlet: it challenges and confronts you and makes you want to turn away, but at the end of it all after your emotions have been nearly completely drained, you are somewhat thankful that you have beared witness to a side of life in which a desperate scream for help rings true - on screen and perhaps off.",

It looked dead serious, but somehow you knew they wanted you to laugh, which made it even more disturbing. For me, anyway. If you aren't disturbed by pedophilia, themes of children reaching their masturbation goals, depressed, overweight and otherwise unhappy individuals, and in fact, you find all of those topics very funny, this may be just the movie for you. The actors were very talented and certainly convincing in their roles. The director made it all seem very real. Enjoy!",

They are confronted over again with the vicissitudes of modern life en fail to overcome them. But by doing so and Bi giving us a glance in the mirror they maintain a strong will for the better of for the worse. a example of the last is the tragedy of the psychiatrist and his love for boys. Well is it love. In that sense he is a bit a sideliner and with him changes the movie in color en becomes harsh. You can sympathize with the teacher en laugh about Vlad, your heart may beat for Seymour; but can you feel also pity for the psychiatrist ?? The movie is so good that it succeeds in this effort. How is the English expression ? tongue in cheek humor ? Well it is full of it. Watch it several times it gets never boring.",

The various obsessive behavioural paterns are acted out beautifully and more importantly very subtly. A script that abounds in so many freaks runs a very high risk of being over-acted. However the entire cast succeeds admirably in avoiding this pitfall. Once again Hofman shows that the only thing between him and an Oscar is picking the right roles. This film being to controversial for the Academy.The plot is worked out excellent. The deeply disturbing presence of a child-rapist is shown as if it could happen in any surrounding. Child-rapist are not necessarily complete social outcast that never wash or shave: they don't have to stick out like a sore thumb. The fact that the movie doesn't seem to condemn it directly doesn't mean is it tolerated. The absence of explicit comment on the child-abuse means the director trusts the audience to know right from wrong. This goes for the rest of the inexcusable behaviour in the film as well.The various other motifs like the loneliness and addictions are acted and shot very nicely.However some things seem to be missing in order for this film to be up there alongside American Beauty (my all time favorite, I must confess). I found the directing in itself very powerful but the overall images in the film very to bland. The were not enough shots that I wanted to see again. I don't mind static shots, as long as there are good to look at.Furthermore the musical score just didn't do it for me. I seems to have been a conscious desicion to reserve a small part for the music, but it's a choice, I feel, that hasn't worked out. To me it makes the movie seem a bit to long.All in all a very, very good film. But it won't make it into my favorites.",

This is mind-boggling in its complexity and ingenuity, right? (And one of the character's names is Joy! Brilliant!) Not really. --Just like the happy, whimsical music that plays throughout the film's soundtrack, we're supposed to either be shocked and sickened by the contrast between the music and the on-screen action, be introduced to new and vertiginous depths of film-making irony--i.e., isn't the music supposed to reflect the action? What's going on? This isn't a happy scene, why the happy music? Either this, or where we just kind of laugh along because we're in on the joke, we know what's going on, we're supposed to laugh, this is a COMEDY. But, well, which is it?Even Solondz, we get the impression, doesn't really know. He makes a grand show of pulling no punches; after all, doesn't this movie have everything even remotely icky? From divorce to suicide, from unhealthy obsession to rape-fantasies, from masturbation to homosexual intolerance, from loneliness to rape to obesity to murder and mutilation and body-parts-in-freezer, from pedophiles to serial rapists to gun-massacre daydreamers to spaced-out psychologists (hey! why not all in one character!), Happiness certainly appears to run the gamut. Maybe that's part of the problem: Solondz has tried putting everything in this movie, every classically cliched, ostensibly gut-wrenching human ugliness to ever touch paper or filmstock. But to what end, to what effect? We're not even given a chance to suffer from any desensitization-guilt, because we've been cold cocked by depravity overload.The humorous aspects of this film play out like a poorly scripted SNL skit. Take the father-son discussions, which are basically Leave It To Beaver parodies as if penned by a college newspaper editor: shoulder-patting, sympathetic nods, sound fatherly advice--and the kid's asking how to 'come.' All this is missing is a laugh track. The over-the-top factor is poorly acted or poorly directed or just poor (\"I'm not laughing at you, I'm laughing with you\"). These attempts, unfortunately, fall short of constituting Happiness as a black comedy.You can't in all seriousness really be shocked or mortified or disgusted by these textbook cases of unpleasantness. The closest we ever come, and only in brief flashes, is with the almost-sympathetic pedophile character. You want to like this guy because you want to feel sympathy for a pedophile rapist because THAT, indeed, would be shocking. And we want nothing more than to be shocked, to oblige Solondz, to recognize and appreciate all his efforts. Unfortunately, it's just not possible. We could have been treated to a darkly disturbing, if perhaps formulaic and manipulative, film, or a goofy, over-the-top, laugh-out-loud (maybe I'm being generous) black comedy of a flick. But we're left with neither. But do me a favor, huh? Don't call it It's a Wonderful Life, or something.",

Your mind will start to dwell on the horrible things that people do, when you suddenly snap out of it because you realize that these are every day people that have serious problems.

Solondz argues that this life is bleak, claustrophobic, deeply solitary, and perhaps not worth the struggle, yet he offers no solution (hence my argument that Happiness was just a selfish stab).  The challenge is not in presenting the problem over and over and over again; that is simple and uninteresting.  The challenge is in offering a viable solution.  But, while the types of problems Solondz shows are becoming more common, they are individual not universal.  The value in Happiness is that it allows one to visualize the fantasies of the neglected, unloved, and mistreated individual, which, if you watch the news, you have seen acted out in horrible and tragic instances.  I probably wouldn't be writing about this if I hadn't just seen American Beauty which, while it is not great and includes some banal moments and a baffling, unnecessary, and disappointing climax, comes much closer to an accurate portrait of suburban life and does finally offer a solution to the unhappy.  That movie was, at least, an attempt to create a work of art. Happiness, if it is remembered at all, will be remembered as the work of an unhappy craftsman, not an artist.

And despite it's title, there's very little happiness on display in the world which the film shows us. It is, by turns, both funny and gut-wrenchingly sad, both watchable and cringeworthy, but never less than brutally honest.This is very much a character piece, the plot at times resembling the intermingling of Robert Altman's films, as we follow some difficult times in the lives of around a dozen characters, who are all connected to varying degrees.All of the characters have problems, covering the whole range of human emotions, from arrogance to smugness, loneliness to murderous, and from sexually frustrated to paedophilia. At times your jaw will drop that such subjects are being broached in a film which is hilarious in many parts, but this discomfort is surely part of Solondz' strategy. Where other films leave us at the threshold, Happiness takes us behind closed doors to look at the lives of people who could well be your neighbours.The acting throughout is first class, especially Dylan Baker as the child-abusing shrink, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the lonely, sexually frustrated office worker. Praise must also go to Jane Adams, playing the social reject of three dysfunctional sisters.If I had any criticisms, it's that the characters in the film all seem to express their inadequacies sexually. And the confession of Hoffman's neighbour seems a little too far-fetched in an otherwise convincing script. But these do not overly detract from the film's good qualities.There is little more I can say about this movie, except to encourage you not to let the subject matter put you off. It's a dark vision of modern life that we see in Happiness, a million miles away from the sinister suburbia of David Lynch, because in Happiness, it could very well be happening right next door...",

Billing this film as a comedy would be quite a mistake, but as a drama is certainly holds its own weight. The scene where the father is confessing himself to his son is one of the most well done scenes I've seen in any movie to date. The film is a study of life, which we tend to sugar-coat all to often. While audience members may cringe at some of the on screen depictions, this is only because of our realization of the awkwardness of our own nature. If you are planning on seeing a film for entertainment, watch Beauty and the Beast.  However, if you are interested in a very well done drama about America (for better or worse), and have the ability to take it straight, Happiness should not be missed.",

These characters seem to get into deeper and deeper trouble no matter what they do, whether they deserve it or not, and although most of these characters are hideous human beings, you can't help but want to hug them and tell them it's all going to be OK.

To me, it's just a bunch of perversions masquerading across the screen, trying to be passed off at \"deep\". \"American Beauty\", I could identify with completely. \"Happiness\", with its pederasts, pervert phone stalkers, and hideously open take on masturbation (handled *much* better in \"Beauty\"), I could not. At all.

It made me laugh, and made me very sad -- and there were some uncomfortable moments that play quick and tense. Oh yeah, my younger sister was also watching it with me.Thank God there was no one around the television set while I watched \"Happiness\" -- nicely, everyone was sleeping. The film was on Cinemax, and started at 1:15 am. I was watching something else, and when I heard \"Happiness\" was next, no matter what the circumstance (too tired, etc) I had to watch it.If you watch \"Happiness\" by yourself, and take it all in, and know that it is going to be, erk, really disturbing, then it won't be as bad as you think. I thought the movie was really sweet-natured sometimes, as when Allen and Kristina fell in love, real love for each other. And although the scene where Kristina describes her experience with Pedro may seem disturbing, it also makes you feel bad for her.There is some great dark comedy in here, and then some actual deepening depressing sadness. As an important scene unfolds, each pause between what the characters are saying to each other adds a really powerful feeling of suspense. You really don't want to hear what they say next.After watching the film, along with it's rather sick (comedy wise) and kind of funny ending, I can't wait until the release of the new upcoming Todd Solondz film, \"Storytellers.\"",

It is interesting to see how social interaction plays out in such an environment. One point that is stressed is that the common person is suffering neurosis. And humanity as a whole - the general populace - have produced an environment that does not nurture the human being. People everywhere are slipping through the cracks. It is a far- reaching point to make. This film is by no means humorous. I don't believe I laughed once. It is a film that is sad, poignant and disturbing. I believe the characters are portrayed in a way that stirs our sympathy. But curiously it is also presented in such a way that we can stand back and look upon it objectively and see the situation \"as it is\" . That is quite a nice balancing trick by the director or writers or whoever: to, at the same time, move us sympathetically and also unemotionally; objectively. I felt like I came to care for these characters, and could see where there suffering was coming from. There were brief moments where two characters found comfort in another, and the distance between them had been overcome, but alas, such moments did not last. This film carries a message: that is, to be more open, more honest, more caring with one another. To somehow develop our sympathy for each other and bridge the gap that exists between us.",

            "content": "The really controversial and daring thing about this film is NOT its portrayal of a remorseful pedophile. The consequences of his actions, both on his family and himself, are devastating. Evidently, some people have taken offense at the idea that he is also a real human being, capable of remorse and grief. By not turning him into a non-human monster, and by forcing the audience to get inside his head, his actions become more terrible, and more reprehensible, not less so. No, this is not the daring thing about this movie. The real daring aspect of the movie is that Solondz takes characters whose lives are desperately out-of-control, whose actions are outrageously shocking, and he makes a COMEDY out of it. The movie succeeds because it is indeed funny, at times hilarious, and yet it does not take its subjects or its characters at all lightly. All of the characters seem very real, which makes their actions all the more shocking. The movie forces us to see the story from each character's point of view, even if that point of view is odd or shocking. The music, rather than intensify our emotional response, shows us the character's own internal feelings. For example, when Bill Maplewood sees his son's friend at a ballgame, the scene is shot as if it were a love scene, complete with slow motion and sweeping, romantic music. This is, of course, the way Bill himself would have felt at the time. By shooting the scene in this way, the viewer is forced inside Bill's head. Since Bill's object of desire is an eleven year old boy, the scene becomes sickeningly ironic. The scene is much more effective and in fact more horrifying than if it had been shot in typical Hollywood style, complete with scary horror-film music. My only complaints about the movie are the subplot involving Kristina (Camryn Manheim), which seems to have been added only for its sick humor value, and the last scene. The last scene seems to be entirely designed to gross out and shock the audience. It is an unsatisfying ending to a movie which is not just trying to shock us, but instead trying to show us the dark, unseen, and all-too-true corners of American life.",

            "content": "Joy, the adult version of Weiner from \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\" sings a song that captures the movie's essence.  All the characters in this film (and Weiner from the previous film, who also sings a \"happy\" song in the midst of suffocating depression)are longing for that elusive happiness.  The pedophile father is the most striking example of someone that is miserable in a \"happy\" environment.  Instead of getting help from a shrink (he himself is a shrink, one of many ironies in the film), he has no one to go to.  If the film has one true villain, it is not the pedophile father but his wife. Her happiness derives from seeing others suffer beneath her well constructed foundation of upper-middle class living.  Solondz bangs away the point whenever something substantive appears to creep up on the conversation the wife interrupts with a \"Have you seen Leno last night?\"  This recurring phrase from the wife echoes the older brother from \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\".  Whenever something occurs that requires discussion or understanding he would remark, \"That would look good on my college application\"  Solondz truly has sympathy for these pathetic people and he even seems to offer some answers.  One answer is to not turn blind eyes to people who suffer around us.  Again going back to the pedophile father, he does not turn his son away whenever he comes with embarrassing prebuescent sexual questions.  He listens and offers honest, frank advices.  This extends to the devastating climactic scene between the father and son when the father reveals his sickness.  In the end Solondz seems to be saying that perhaps the son is all the more healthy for the honest conversation (The son's gleeful smile towards the end of the movie is the ONLY genuinely happy emotion in the entire film).  This is the best film of 1998 by far and I completely disagree with the comment criticizing the Ben Gezzara and Louise Lassar scenes.  Instead of pointlessly trying to define what \"effective\" means, he/she should have at least try to understand the sadness/loss of will one might encounter in anyone's twilight years.  Solondz has made a film that is touching yet spiced with deadly satire and even some that are laugh out loud funny.",

I believe he was turned on making Happiness and also hopes to titillate a select audience - an audience who enjoys seeing others transgress or emotionally tortured. I believed the director enjoyed it when the loving Happiness wife found out about her sick husband and their worlds crumbled and also when the lonely teacher character, after being used, emerges in a warped way as the winning loser? Is the point being that those that appear as winners are rarely while those that appear as losers are, through their inner strength, comfort and acceptance of their station, after all, winners?

This film indeed shows the vile and disgusting sexual habits of people. However, it makes no attempt to justify what is seen, nor does it come to any conclusion concerning the sick and twisted habits. From domestic abuse, pedophilia, the desire to be raped, and other human ugliness, \"Happiness\" has easily become the worst movie I have ever seen...ever. When it was finished I actually had to sit and talk to my friends and explain why this film bothered me so much, just so I could carry on with my day. I have seen American History X, Magnolia, American Beauty, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse Now and agree that they are all in their own right, excellent films. They are excellent because they display the ugliness and depravity of our nature, but in the end explain its absurdity. I dare say happiness goes on to glorify it. The director spends so much time depicting the raping of a small boy that I wonder how these child actors were effected by this role. I wonder how people can sleep at night having decided that this is quality cinema. The concept of watching a man seduce an adolescent on film, and come to no moral justification is so beyond my scope of rationality, that I honestly would punch the director int he face if I saw him. \"Happiness\" is sick, twisted, and contributing to the demise of our world. I have never felt more passionately about my hate for a film. It is complete at utter garbage.On a side note, the musical score was weak at best, the plot line is terrible, the director has strange unexplainable scenes and cuts, and the actors take so long to say their lines I could go make a snack before any serious dialogue is accomplished.",

Happiness is new territory in what filmmakers can do and get away with. It is a slow, long, messy film with several awkward contrivances, but it also has flashes of genius - the dog licking the ***, the final line of the movie \"I came! I came.\"; the psychiatrist and the bravery to let him admit f****** young boys was great and he'd do it again; the self-obsessed writer who's conceit and disdain encourages the audience to identify with her detestable neighbour, to actually want him to f*** her - which really is a major achievement of charaterisation and positioning - to get an audience to identify with a murderer, a rapist, a pedophile, and a whole host of other hapless hopers. This film strikes a chord because it outs the world of the white lie, the secret desire, the dark thought, the nightmare and the fantasy. Like Freudian psychoanalysis it seeks to make the latent and the repressed real and recognised. \"It's okay to be fucked up\" is the element of catharsis in this film. And because it is so unashamedly perverse and disturbing it is a quality experience - it either drives people out of the cinema or it makes them think and talk about issues we as a society need to talk about but rarely do, except in simplified and dismissive moral cliches that let us escape the ugliness of the reality facing some people. It is not condoning the subject so much as broaching it - a \"please consider\" moreso than a \"oh what a feeling\". It elicits a strong emotional response, but by putting a human face to failure, frustration, self-hatred, and sexual urges, blurs the morality of our \"hang 'em all/lock 'em up and throw away the key\" mentality. As such, Happiness is an amoral film that elicits a sophisticated self-questioning moral response. It is investigative not exploitative, a comedy not a tragedy, genius rather than gratuitous.",

            "content": "This somewhat Allenesque film concerns itself with rather bizarre family problems and pushes the envelope in dealing with taboo subjects.  Actually, the frank sexual discussions were unnerving at times and made me uncomfortable--probably one of the points the film attempts to make:  real problems like these exist in dysfunctional families that otherwise pass for normal.  The toast to happiness that occurs is ironic because all of the female characters sitting around the table have yet to find happiness or have lost what little happiness they thought they possessed. More ironic is the fact that Ben Gazzara's character (the only male at the table) passes up his daughter's offer to find someone for him. Might one of the messages of this film be that the male's penis is its own source of ultimate happiness? That question may seem odd but once you've seen the film it will make more sense. This is an interesting but somewhat strange movie.  The acting is uncomfortably credible. Todd Solondz, who wrote and directed, did a brilliant job--what might have been mere offensive caricature in less skilled hands are flesh and blood characters, quite believable, with a poignant story to tell. The mix of humor and pathos is presented in perfect counterpoint lending lively rhythm to the film's pace that is further enhanced by artful editing.",

I was very disappointed.  I was expecting a painful movie to watch, but in the good way: where you can really relate to the pain that the characters go through.  What was missing was any sort of sympathy for the characters or even something to make me hate them.  Alas, more than halfway through the movie I really didn't care about any of the characters anymore and decided I had wasted enough time watching.  It's extremely rare for me not to see a movie through to the end, but it was simply torture to watch the very long (10+ minute) scenes where not all that much happened and I started forgetting about all of the other characters.Things happened, but with no insight into why they happened. Why did the characters do the things they did?  Without giving too much away, why did the grandfather living in Florida feel nothing?  Why did he want to be alone?  What about Helen?  Having a scene where she screams \"I'm no good\" is just awful writing: SHOW me, don't TELL me! And especially don't have her tell us she's no good, but then won't follow through when the opportunity (Allen at the door) arises for her to SHOW us that she really thinks that she isn't a deserving person.I could go on, but I've already wasted enough of my time on this.",

Happiness is a vision of pedophilia, masturbation, phone sex, rape, loneliness, envy, and a great many other various forms of sin from the mind of Todd Solondz. While this movie takes film to uncharted depths of depravity in filmmaking, this movie is also at the same time very humane. While this movie deals with so called \"monsters\" in society, serial rapists, self-absorbed fascists, and sexual deviants, the brilliance in this movie is that it doesn't fall into the typical pattern of simply funneling these easily despisable characters into established stereotypes. By showing them as people who are like the rest of us but simply lack a certain basic moral judgement, it makes it a lot harder for us to just pass them off as inherently evil. It makes you understand why people in the news who discover child molesters lived in their neighborhoods always say \"but they were so normal....\"",

We like to have heros to cheer and villains to boo.  There are no clear distinctions here of who is \"good\" and who is \"bad\", a lot like life itself. Real people don't tend to fall into either the \"villain\" or the \"saint\" category.I laughed really hard at this movie, and felt a little guilty at  laughing at some real human suffering.Great acting from everyone in the cast, a great script, great directing.Unfortunately a movie that got almost no big screen distribution because it was not rated (it would have received an NC-17 for dialogue alone).

Unlike other \"disturbing\" films such as BLUE VELVET, which present the darkest actions and motivations in settings that are heightened to be satirically pristine or hellishly dark, HAPPINESS presents things ranging from obscene phone calls and adultery to rape, pederasty and murder in an almost mundane environment ~ so mundane that the people in this film could easily be your neighbors.  This film features astounding performances, all embarrassingly overlooked by the Academy, particularly Dylan Baker's portrayal of the aforementioned pederast.  He makes us understand how he's losing control of his attraction to little boys in a miraculous way.  He makes up glad we aren't in his shoes and we never hate him more than he hates himself.  The cast is uniformly excellent, so it's difficult to point to any one stnnd-out.  The film's only drawback is it's lack of focus.  At the center, and there is  center, are three sisters played by Cynthia Stevenson (the housewife who \"has it all\" including a pederast husband), Lara Flynn Boule (the successful poet who believes she's a fraud because she writes poems about rape without ever having been raped) and Jane Adams (the ne'er do well whose sweet disposition has lit up a neon sign above her head that reads \"doormat\").  We not only deal with the men in their lives and their problems, but also with their mother and father's separation and Ms. Boyle's secret admirer/ obscene phone caller next-door neighbor, who in turn is adored by the chubby girl across the hall.  Too many stories!  Yet, every last one of them is heartfelt and interesting and very, very dark.",

            "content": "Happiness strips reality bare. It shows us how the world really is, shocking us out of any cosy, bigoted notions about life and people which we might have.I won't go into the plot in detail, because that would be going over what you already know for those who have seen it, and spoiling it for those who haven't. Let's just say it follows the three Jordan sisters of New Jersey; Trish, whose psychiatrist husband Bill is secretly a paedophile and budding child rapist; Helen, who is being stalked by the lonely, sex-obsessed Allen; and Joy, who gets a job teaching newly arrived immigrants in NYC, and starts an affair with one of them, only for him to emerge as a thief who is only after her money. There's also the sisters' parents, Lenny and Mona, who have retired to Florida and are now splitting up after decades of marriage.The theme of Happiness ostensibly appears to be the idea that middle-class, suburban society is not what it seems; there is perversion lurking behind every door, and the perfect family man living next door to you could in fact be a paedophile and a rapist. As Bill says to Joe Grasso at one point in the film, \"appearances can be deceptive.\" This is doubtless a genuine theme which Solondz wanted to express, but I feel that it goes deeper than this.I think what Solondz was really trying to do in Happiness was to tear down our ideas about morality. In Happiness, people are shown as they really are, not divided off into the black and white realms of good and evil, as bigots tend to see people. Happiness twists normal ideas of good and bad beyond recognition. The most obvious example would be the character of Bill - he is a paedophile, but is shown not to be a monster but a caring father who is deeply tormented by his own urges. But the character of Allen is another good example - he may immediately strike us as a pervert, but he turns out to have a caring side, as shown when he gives Kristina a tissue and offers to take her out. Kristina is obsessed with Allen and is stalking him, just as Allen is himself stalking Helen - by showing a stalker WITH a stalker, Solondz shows us the relativity of morality, and one woman's stalker is another woman's stalking victim. The real world is not a black and white one of evil stalkers and good victims - it is much more complex, composed of subtle shades of grey. Kristina goes on to reveal to Allen that she killed Pedro, the doorman who raped her. When she asks Allen if they can still be friends, Allen says \"I guess, yeah, I mean everyone has their, you know, their pluses and minuses.\" This reiterates the same theme of moral relativism - the world is not neatly divided into camps of good and evil, we're all on the same scale, and the most evil person in the world has good in them, just as the most good person in the world has evil in them.Another theme in Happiness is that of determinism - the idea that people do not choose their actions, and they cannot therefore be held morally responsible for them. Confessing his paedophilia to his son Billy, Bill explains his actions by saying \"I couldn't help myself\", a line that has already be spoken by Kristina. And is it me, or does Billy look like a young Allen? Billy and Allen are also both obsessed with masturbating. Is Solondz saying that Billy has been turned into a pervert like Allen by the trauma of discovering his father's paedophilia? Whether determinism is right or wrong, it is undeniable that people are often forced into unpleasant situations by prior circumstances - so it is hard to impose judgement on them.In Happiness, it in fact becomes IMPOSSIBLE to impose judgement on ANYONE. What Happiness ultimately presents to us is a total moral nihilism - good and bad do not exist, there is only happiness and (more often) suffering. It's not that there is perversion lurking behind every door, it's that there ARE no perverts. \"Normality\" and \"perversion\", \"good\" and \"bad\", do not refer to anything at all. Whether Solondz is correct about that or not, it is certainly a view of the world to which I can relate.Now, it may be possible to criticise Happiness as being too pessimistic, as offering no solutions to the problems of life which it highlights, but the fact is that there often ARE no solutions. Happiness is a film which, above all, remains true to reality, and in reality, there are often no solutions to the great deal of suffering in life. So why watch it? The answer is that Happiness is, against all the odds, not a depressing film. Despite the unpleasant events with which it deals, Solondz makes it a very funny and humane film. I actually find it quite a therapeutic film to watch when I am down, in that it lays bare the problems of life and changes my perspective on them, helps me take a more philosophical attitude to things and a less judgemental attitude to other people. By dealing with the problems of life so candidly, the film Happiness is actually one of the few things that has come out of a human mind which actually transcends those problems. It is like an island of humour and wisdom in a world full of suffering and madness. Solondz said the following about his film Welcome to the Dollhouse, but it could apply equally well to Happiness: \"The film is a comedy because that is the only way I know how to deal with excruciating torment, and I find something both funny and poignant in the struggle to endure humiliation.\"",

Every role is well cast with veterans like Ben Gazarra and newcomers like Hoffman. The picture is rich in irony and avoids satire which justifies its description as a dark comedy. My main issue after seeing it was to try to understand the film's purpose. I like ambiguity but this movie tears me between humor and pathos. If the film maker wanted me to laugh, he was successful. Even at the aberrant behavior of its characters. But when the laughter ends, like in the emotional scene between the perverted father and his son, this viewer felt guilty for laughing in the first place. Am I to think of aberrant sexuality as amusing? Are we to glory in someone who rapes women over the telephone, or who sodomizes 11 year old kids? If that's the purpose, then it denies any nobility the picture otherwise has. Without that scene, and the feeling of being jerked around, we have a picture about the strange routes that some of us take to achieve happiness, and I can have a guilt-free laugh at their foolishness.",

There is no happiness in these characters' lives, and ironies are strewn all about the movie.

            "review_title": "Good, but highly overrated",
            "content": "On paper, Happiness is the type of film that could breath vitality and freshness onto movie screens across America.  Unfortunately the film that I saw was not the daring, reckless, taboo-shattering film that it was purported to be. Instead I found a film that was so clumsily put together and so filled with \"padding\" that its hard to discern what Solondz was trying to say and if there was anything being said at all.  Happiness is definitely a film that is worth watching for there are scenes which truly do fit the labels applied to it, but the problem is that there is such a huge disparity in quality between those scenes which really do work to affect the viewer and those which do not.  In an interview, Solondz has said that this film resulted from a multitude of stories which could have been films, but as he was unable to choose one over another, he put them all into the mix. Unfortunately, this is construction is felt through the entire film as the ties which bind the stories together are tenuous at best.Solondz' problem is not so much one of content but of cinematic structuring. As I mentioned above, there are scenes and characters that are truly interesting and do fit what many are saying about this film.  The problem, though, is that for the few moments that are truly effective, there are so many that are not only ineffective, but are so poorly rendered that they leave a bad taste in ones mouth (I'm thinking especially of the scenes with the patriarch and matriarch of the family).  My own phrase \"truly effective\" has to be called into question as well, for what do I mean by saying that a scene is \"truly effective?\"  Considering the rubric under which this film is being judged \"truly effective\" would then have to refer to the scene's ability to shock and/or horrify.  Under this set of conditions, I would have to say that no scene, then, was \"truly effective\" for me at all. Representing a pedophile as a sympathetic character does not constitute a truly shocking act - for isn't pedophilia perhaps one of the most sympathetic of sexual obsessions?  In our society it is an act that has been deemed \"taboo\" but on what real grounds?  There is something of a sadness around the figure of the pedophile as theirs is a sexual desire that can only be gratified illegally, and the only possible outcome is the harming of the object of that desire.Solondz' film is about people trying to make connections in a society where forces are constantly pushing people apart form each other and from themselves.  Considering this, the only true connection we find in the film centers around the pedophile and his interactions with young boys, especially his son.  Around them swirl this array of characters who engage in meaningless sexual gratification and self-destructive activities, but here we find a character who really cares.  Isn't there something sad about the fact that true connection is deemed taboo due to societal ideas about perversion?  If any of the other characters had found the \"connection\" which this film seems to be looking for, both in thematic and in structure, we would have been happy.  Seymour-Hoffman's relationship with Manheim comes close, but they are ripped apart in the end leaving them (we suppose) apart. So that leaves us to locate the only truly meaningful contact in the film between the pedophile and his son.The pedophilic urge underlies all of these scenes, as we can only imagine the thoughts springing to Baker's mind at the idea of his son's sexual urgings, and perhaps we almost look for the scene where they connect physically.  Perhaps the saddest thing of all is that taboo keeps this thing from happening.  His son cries as he finds out that his father cannot bring himself to violate the ultimate in taboo and \"make love\" to him like he did to the other boys.  Baker says he would \"jerk off\" instead - he has gone far compared to societal standards, but he cannot take the \"final step\" so to speak.  What this film does show us is how our ideas of what is appropriate sexual conduct derive so wholly from the dictums of society that we deny ourselves the type of love that might be most appropriate to our persona and contain ourselves within a label (most often heterosexual) which might not fit.  Baker's dreams of destruction may derive as much from inability to act on his urgings as they do from guilt over them.  Now, I'm not trying to condone this type of behavior - as I'm so caught up in the types of codes which set the standards that it is hard to dissociate myself - I'm merely trying to think about sexuality and society and how they work together on each other in this film.I'm not sure if this was what Solondz was going for at all.  The fragmentation of the film into multiple stories blunts attempts to read anything at all in the film.  Judging form what I've written it might seem that the only thing worth seeing in this film is its depiction of pedophilia, and that might be true.  There are other nice scenes and even something of a hopeful cast at points, but on the whole the film is unsatisfying.  I do applaud the look of the film - the way shadows are used to give a sense of darkness around the edges of this world is nice and creates a coherent visual pattern throughout.  But other than this Solondz show a rather complete lack of anything resembling a cinematic style. Perhaps transparency is the effect he's trying for - I don't know.  In the end, the film is rather disappointing as I would have liked to see Solondz either truly delve into the mind of the pedophile or extend the beginning questions he asks there into the rest of the film's relationships.",

It knocked me out, and I feel it is one of the greatest films of the 90's.The movie it most reminded me of in structure and cynicism is Robert Altman's Short Cuts, another great film of the 90's. But where Altman's film was somber and made you leave the theater wanting to kill yourself, Solondz' film makes you laugh. Its dark humor and cynicism recalls Stanley Kubrick's films. But where Kubrick's films are cold and judgmental, and his characters have no redeeming qualities whatsoever, Solondz makes his characters likable and sympathetic despite their destructiveness.This film features at least 5 Oscar worthy performances. If the movie had concentrated on any one of these characters, it would have been spellbinding.  The performance above all performances is by Dylan Baker as the pedophile psychologist. I don't know if I've never seen a character quite like him in any movie. (He is a monster, but he is somehow redeemed by the fact that he clearly loves his family.) Also creating characters that will live in my memory forever are Jane Adams as the loser Jordan sister (so funny and heartbreaking -- where'd she come from?), Philip Seymour Hoffman as the geek who makes obscene phone calls in his spare time for his only gratification, Cynthia Stevenson as the self-deluding housewife who professes to have a storybook life and marriage while her husband is out diddling young boys, and Louise Lasser as the grandmother dealing with a marital split in advanced age.When I was watching the film I had the horrifying but probably accurate thought that this movie is probably more representative of real life than almost any other movie I have ever seen.Acting, direction, cinematography all work together as one scene after another in this film is played out to gut-wrenching, nervous-laughter-inducing perfection.It's hard to imagine Todd Solondz, young as he is and with only 3 movies under his belt, will ever top this directorial effort.

I have most recently seen Requiem for a Dream, and think that this is one of the most exciting films of the decade.  Darren Ofnosky is a truly talented director that should have received more attention than he actually got. But, this film is just disgusting...plain and simple.  What was the point to bringing the topic of pedophilia to the screen?  Granted, it is important to me to understand various types of people in today's society, but what makes this director think that we should have any kind of sympathy for a pedophile?  I don't care if it's uncontrollable, or a disease, or some sort of warped mental condition...it's just plain sick.  And how could the parents of the 12 year old boy let their son play a role of this nature? Have we lost all sense of our ethics and morals in this society?  Do we have no boundaries??  How is the directors deep portrayal of this movie any different from men that actually commit these crimes?  And how can any person actually get anything out of watching a little boy masturbate?  Yes, it's sad to realize the affects that pediophilia may have on immediate family, I think that it is common sense that the affects are devastating, but why portray it in this manner?  To this degree?  It may be a real portrayal of real life, but shouldnt some things just be left untouched?  This is entertainment?  Watching this is supposed to open my eyes and bring a sense of reality into my life?  No, it just makes me wonder how warped the director actually is to get this explicit with this topic. I think that it would have been different if the director had actually tried to go somewhere with it, if his message was to somehow make us aware of this condition, to see it in a different light and give his audience something to think about.  But all it did for me was bring out disgust and anger.  I hope no director ever touches this topic again in the way that this director did.

No one gets mad when a movie is made about Hitler, or some infamous murderer. Why are those horrific situations any different than the ones in this movie? Movies are made for the audience to understand something from a different perspective and to understand people and why they do the things they do. I appreciate the bold honesty of this film; who wants to see pretty perfect people doing normal things? That to me isn't real life. Movies are supposed to induce emotions: happiness, sorrow, disgust, whatever. Movies should move the audience. Weather it be in a good way or a bad way. Philip Seymour Hoffman is one of the best male actors ever and he makes any movie art. No, he didn't portray someone we should respect and look up to, but he gets respect because he was honest with himself in doing this role and he accomplished the goal of any actor...pretend your someone so the audience will truly understand who they were. I must admit, this film was kind of boring, but compelling at the same time, so I give it a 6.",

This is the freedom that indie directors have over the big names and Solondz uses this to his advantage to paint an ugly portrait of sexual harassment, paedaphilia and alienation.

The film features suicide, rape, drug addiction, murder, child abuse etc. and if you're going to make comedy out of these things then you have to actually play it and film it as comedy, otherwise it's just upsetting. While the performances are good, the characters are almost universally despicable, and I didn't feel any empathy for any of them, thanks to the film's overwhelmingly misanthropic tone. Having said all that, it's a fairly good film. It's well shot, well acted, a little slow but just about gets away with it, and definitely too long.

Anyone who has attended high school should be numb to this kind of dialogue and not finding it especially amusing. I'm not knocking the film or its dialogue, but the audience's inclination to laugh at \"naughty talk,\" and, in my opinion, miss the point. This is one movie I wish I had rented and watched with adults who don't snicker at the \"f\" word. That said: the performances were great. Justin Elvin was incredible.

Solondz's not-so-subtle reference (homage) to the Abe Lincoln/Shirley Temple relationship in \"The Littlest Rebel\" made the holographic banana plotline even more humorous and shocking than it would have been otherwise.The twisted tale of pedophilia is of little consequnce in this movie.  As my grandmother used to say \"If books were made for burning, this one would have gotten stuck in the attic long ago\".  The self-righteous American social culture among Americans is sure to be more upset with the scathing critique of the Narco-militaristic Industrial Complex.Although Greco and Perry give reasonable performances, one would like to have seen Erik Estrada as the banana, perhaps.  (His classic role as Ponch lives on, despite his tragic death.) Greco apparently hasn't gotten much work since 21 Jump Street. Perry on the other hand, aside from his work with Ron Jeremy, has been doing German cabaret films for the last few years. Pretty good!The soundtrack is provided by up and coming Japanese rocker chicks, Whitesnake.  It is quite moving, especially the Blondie covers!Word on the street is that Solondz's next project is a documentary, probably about Swedish farmers and the stews they love, but I've also heard that he may decide on something else instead.You should see this movie because it is so good and wonderful.",

I think my favorite character was that of Allen played by Phillip Seymore-Hoffman (I may have spelled that wrong).

While many may define my reaction as the mark of a Great Film, I think it is a reaction to having viewed Child Pornography.I am offended by very, very little.  However, I must take major exception to pedophilia played as comedy.  I've heard Solondz argue that his film \"is not comedy\"... how then, do you define the scene in which a child rapist first notices his next victim?  While he lustfully stares at the 11 year old boy playing a baseball game, saccharin Love-Storyesque music is played underneath.  Or perhaps the dog lapping at semen, when a 12 year old ejaculates for the first time.  Are these not the devices of comedy..?   I find them the devices of perversity.Before you condemn me as prudish, let me say the vile perversity of TRAINSPOTTING had me rolling in the aisles.  Likewise, I found MAN BITES DOG to be a brilliant, hilariously disturbing portrait of murder.  Futhermore, I think BLUE VELVET is one of the finest films ever made.  What differentiates those films from HAPPINESS?  The victims are not CHILDREN!!!!I asked myself-- is pedophilia off limits in terms of artistic examination? No, I don't think it is.  But it is an issue that demands the utmost in care and thought in its examination.  That excludes the \"comedy\" (although Todd would surely say otherwise) of this vile piece of film-making.  Which also brings up another issue, why is Todd so hung up on pubescent sexuality?  For God's sake, he's in his 30s... get over it already.I've never, ever been a proponent of censorship.  But however, in this case, I must applaud Universal for pulling out of distributing this film.  Hurray for the bookburners!  (God, I can't believe I just said that...

The last 15 minutes is without doubt the most uncomfortable I have ever witnessed in film. Some people that I have spoken to who watched the film stated that they found themselves feeling a certain amount of sympathy for the paedophile psychiatrist played by Dylan Baker. I certainly felt sympathy for a fair few of the characters, not least Philip Seymour Hoffman's hopeless crank caller, but I can't say I felt that much sympathy for Baker's character. I never got the feeling that he was particularly sorry about the things that he had done, and was certainly the creepiest character in the film (which says something). On the other hand, my sympathies lay with the young Billy as you watch his world fall apart as he finds out his father is not who he believes to be, and with Joy, the only genuinely likable sister who seems to suffer one mishap after another in her pursuit of happiness.This would have been unbearable if it were not for a blackly comic sense of mischief that is apparent through the whole film. The music is almost ridiculously out of place throughout the most part of the film, which only adds to the black comedy throughout. Thankfully though, this is not used in some of the more controversial scenes. The performances are universally great, especially Philip Seymour Hoffman who manages to bring to his character a certain amount of pathos that a character as vile as his does not deserve. Ben Gazarra also does a great job as the sisters' father, while Dylan Baker puts in the most memorable turn as the family man, who suffers from the most terrible urges.Ultimately Solondz has made an unflinchingly brilliant look at the underbelly of America. This film will succeed in offending a lot of people, but he won't be bothered about that. At the same time, while the film is excellent, I don't think it's one that I could watch again.Shame that Solondz has not been able to scale the heights of this since, though.",

Yes, there are people out there that are similar to these characters in many ways.  The point of the film was behind the peoples' sexual dysfunctions there are humans with lives.  Sex will always be a major issue in society.  Whether people want to push it behind closed doors is their business.  Understanding one's own sexuality is part of each person.

So if people want to say this movie was shocking and trivialized topics, they have a lot to learn about themselves, or should see this movie again and admire what a great piece of work it is,",

Amongst 1998's \u00abchosen few\u00bb \"Happiness\" was definitely the best.This is a movie that portraits violence and frustration, solitude and cruelty enclosed in a frame of numb, fragile and clueless despair; there's no message of hope hidden somewhere, no symbolisms on the set, no phony final redemption of our hero(es)...  And you can't stop laughing. Your social-oriented conscious wants you to reject this crude exhibition of weaknesses but you just can't help it. This ridicule of everyday life overrides the censorship of a sane, civilized mind.What's \"Happiness\" all about, anyway? Well, its a test, you see. Don't matter if you identify yourself with the emptiness its characters experience. It only matters if you can laugh at it. If you don't, you fail.

Solondz is patronizing, amateurish, and downright boring in his directing.  If you want to see a movie with shock value, get 'Pink Flamingos'; if you want to see a quality psychological ensemble comedy, get a Woody Allen film. If you want to see Philip Baker Hall (not a bad idea), get 'Boogie Nights' or 'The Big Lebowski'.

It is not a sordid film, but it is controversial. It purports to show human dissatisfaction and pain and suffering. It is not a film for a Friday or Saturday night with your partner or friends. I recommend watching this on your own when you have time to yourself.The film has emotional depth and has a lot of truth about what it is like to be unhappy and lonely. I think most of us watching this by ourselves would be able to relate this film to some of our own fears and insecurities (though obviously not expressed in such extreme and disturbing ways). It makes you question life a little. It is not about happiness, but quite the opposite. However, the unhappiness of people and society is expressed in a humorous light.

His characters, while so non-normative that they could easily be described by the general movie-going public as 'perverted' either sexually, or socially, actually provide a genuine source of identification, if not due to their actions, then their environment. The suburbs have long been examined as a source of perversion, or subversion, but \"happiness\", much like Solondz's previous feature \"Welcome to the Dollhouse\", provides a 'fresh', if not more disturbing, examination of this reference point. Sitting in a cinema with 300 hundred other people, allows one the possibility of witnessing the 'devices of awkwardness' in action. No doubt, anyone who did see the film in its cinematic release can testify that the only way to get through this movie without feeling somehow to blame for what is going on in the world which Solondz creates to mirror our own, is to laugh uncomfortably. And boy did people laugh.And while they were laughing I kept looking around, wondering how many of them were feeling this pang of guilt, or identification... \"Happiness\" is an amazing film because while it doesnt condone what it represents, it places it in the context of the everyday, of the banal, of the family, and the individual...",

I didn't find it either one.The film follows some very odd characters who lead very unusual lives. There's a stalker, an obsessive-compulsive writer and even a child molester. The story is basically about them trying to find Happiness, in a weird way. I've seen it done better. On the surface, these characters deliver dialogue that is supposed to shock you. Below the surface is a script trying to pull you in to identify with these characters.I couldn't identify with them at all.I was not offended by any of the bizarre events in this movie. I laughed quite a bit in some places, and although I felt a little guilty about one subject, I still managed to churn out a laugh.Todd Solondz does have a bright future ahead of him. His script is rather witty and in a morbid way, funny. Where he fails is trying to give his characters life. I couldn't agree with anyone in this picture, not because of their actions, but by poor character development. It's like he wrote out all of these weird scenarios and forgot to give any of his characters depth. Some might find what they say deep enough, but for me, I need to know more. Like how did they become the way they are, or why? How about a little background info? No dice.Sometimes it's not what happens to a character or what a character says that makes you sad, it's what a character doesn't do...develop.Rating: 4.5 out of 10",

Nothing is more frustrating for the viewer than characters you would like to relate to that just don't seem to cope with everyday social events like.... talking (take the scorching opening scene of this film for instance).I probably have never seen a film, which made me feel so ashamed for the actions of the characters in the story. Happiness is a comedy, but the only time you laugh is out of embarrassment with what you get to see.All main characters are in some way damaged or distorted, with as a poignant zenith the paedophile familyman. The final scene with this man and his son is without a doubt the most stressing and oppressing scene ever put to film.When I left this film, I immediately noticed I was looking in a different way at people passing on the street. Everybody has a secret life, but nobody ever tells. In Happiness it's the only thing you see, the secret life of seemingly normal people. It is the perfect example of what you never want to become. And although a few of the many characters in this film are not really that believeable and real, there is enough sickness, embarrassment, stress and psychological suspence to make a wonderfully embarrassing movie about life.>",

Yes, I found it a bit uneasy and a bit stirring, but not because of the subjects it touches - pedophilia, murder, rape - every day I see stories in the newspaper that report cases of all of those and a wide variety of other crimes and perversity. It was the intimacy in which the stories are told - (possible spoiler) when little Billy and his father speak about masturbation, and later about rape. The unspoken scene when Allen enters Helen's apartment was one of my favorites, maybe because it's very real, very possible. The movie's title is very ironic, in my opinion, because the movie deals more with the abscence of happiness rather than that. It is very funny, in a very sarcastic way, but also very serious and sad. It's a bit exaggerated (well, related to my own life, anyway), but not unbelievable. Of course, for the movie to be like I describe it, the acting should be excellent and the filmmaking flowing and direct, as they both are. I'd recommend this movie to everyone, but not everyone wants to see the world in all its ugliness, not that \"Happiness\" shows even one thousandth of it, but happiness is something close to all our hearts. Oh, and on other reviews I read that people would like to keep children out of this film, well, I don't think it would traumatize them or hurt them in any way, it isn't like children these days don't know about pedophilia or sex. I think children simply wouldn't understand what this movie's all about, since a child's definition of happiness is very different from an adult's.",

There seems to be a war going on between those who think it was real and worth viewing and those who think it is completely far-fetched and just plain sick, thus not worth watching. I must say that I think it is a good dose of reality for those living in their own little sheltered worlds. Those who think that these kinds of things are not going on in today's world, even right down your pristine little suburban street are the deluded ones! Yes, it is hard to watch, yes it is sick, but it is REAL!!And it does happen!! I think it is uncomfortable for many because maybe it hits too close to home! I think it is fair to say that anyone watching this film can identify with at LEAST one of the so-called 'sicknesses' of the characters, therefore, it is the look in to the dark recesses of their own minds that makes them so uncomfortable. The world is a messed up place, and we all contribute to that in our own fashion, some more than others, but nevertheless, we all do, because our lives all clash with one another at some point. The best we can do is to face it and deal with it, not act as though we are separate from it! I suppose what I am trying to say is that this work is an important, unflinching look at the REAL reality in this world and, like it or not, it does affect you in one way or another, so you might as well face up to it by identifying with this film!

However, the craft of the film is undeniable and that could certainly be called \"good\".  I was captured by the film.  I could not walk away. Even at its most desturbing moments, I was spellbound by the Father and Son relationship.  I cried for Joy -- almost everytime she was on the screen.

            "content": "This is one of my absolute favorite movies. Great characters.  Great story.  Some absolutely hysterical scenes.I have to point out that this movie is not for everyone.  I don't want to give too much away, but some of the subject matters are extreme to say the least.  This is not the kind of movie that your mother would like (or at least my mom).  You actually sympathize with some people who do some pretty horrible things.  The characters that you really hate in this movie don't really do anything too wrong (when compared with some of the other characters), you hate them for being small-minded, judgmental, and phony.There are some hysterical parts in this movie, but I see it more as a drama than a comedy.  You really get involved with the characters.I think that one of the themes of this movie that other reviews missed is that it is about happiness, about what makes people happy.  Some characters pretend to be what they think a happy person should be and are miserable for it.  Some characters do whatever makes them happy despite what others may think and despite the consequences of their actions.This is a very smart movie, kind of like a more twisted version of \"American Beauty\".  I was upset by the fact that this movie is not more accessible.  I had never even heard of it until I was watching \"American Beauty\" with some of my friends and one told me that if I liked \"American Beauty\", I would like \"Happiness\" too.  He was right.  I realize that a movie like this is not going to be widely accepted, but I would think that I would have at least heard of a movie that is this good and this well made. The fact that I hadn't even head of it took a lot of my faith away from the movie industry.This movie is not only terrific, but it is also entertaining.  A combination that you don't see in a lot of movies.  This movie is not for everyone, but if you're the kind of person who can handle some extreme subject matters, than you will love it.  10 out of 10.By the way, if you have not seen this movie, watch which imdb reviews you read.

However, although it was almost an emotional ordeal to watch, I must admit that i truly enjoyed this film. There is enough sick humor involved to keep a dedicated viewer from being completely appalled...though dedicated is sort of a relative term. The acting is superb- Phillip Seymour Hoffman does a nauseatingly good job at portraying a pudgy, pasty, perverse cubical-dweller. John Lovitts...is...well...John Lovitts. In my twisted opinion, the best scene is of course, the last...a powerful example of why you should never, ever, ever trust the tongue of a dog. To put it simply, if your ideal movie is something along the lines of the wizard of oz or other PG-or-lower tripe, this film will leave a profoundly bad taste in your mouth...and thats assuming you don't even finish watching.

Adding to their troubles are the people around them, who both mirror and amplify their lack of contentment. What could be called bad behavior isn't done arbitrarily or viciously: rather, good intentions gone real bad. Therein dwells the irony and wry, dark humor....very Shakesperean. The characters, script, scenes, and editing make this a gem. Note: this isn't a Disney film, and nor is it about happy people. Well, maybe one person finds it.",

All of us have had experiences the mere thought of which makes our hearts clench with disgust. This film is filled with nothing but such experiences. It leaves you with a feeling of defeat, disgust, and hopelessness.

Possibly the most important part in this movie is the song written by Joy expressing her need for happiness, you see we all need happiness, and if happiness is sex than what about the pedophiles, and perverts,  all they need is happiness too. This movie not only fearlessly faces those issues, but also creates them. I never thought about pedophiles, and other perverts in such a way before, I still believe that most of what they do is wrong in every way shape and form, but now I can see it from their point of view. That is what this movie does, it shows you these characters what they do, what they want, and all that, but it does not judge them, or tell the audience that these men are bad with harsh jarring music, or an aphorism expressed by a surrounding character berating them for what they are.

However, nothing seems to be what it appears to be as their lives, to varying degrees, spiral out of control. The cast, which includes Philip Seymour Hoffman, Lara Flynn Boyle, and Ben Gazzara, among others, dish out their lines with a droll dryness that can be found only in a Solondz film. The script is cringe-inducingly funny, the individual stories are interesting without exception, and the languid pacing allows the viewer to absorb all of the horrors presented.

Life becomes a a cycle of aimless wandering, searching for meaning when the characters themselves are actually preventing their own personal development. Everyone is doomed and desperate, struggling for desires that often come from rather immoral or selfish motivations, but each 'sympathetically pathetic' in their total inability to fight back against this natural order that Solondz presents. It's a desolate film, but also totally aware of its capability for dark comedy, relishing in tragic irony as the sole relief in what is otherwise a hell of repression and self-deceit. In short, you'll laugh, but you won't have a fun time.\n\nI like to think that Baker's Bill Maplewood is actually a darkly comic take on Peter Graves' Captain Clarence Oveur from Airplane!; \"have you ever seen a grown man naked?\" (3.5/5)",

At other times, this is a drama that  will probably deeply upset you. It all feels like a bit of a cruel joke really but then you see that, well, there's nothing else like this is there? Why can't a rom-com also be about the, um, 'stuff' that this film is about? Why can't I laugh one minute and want to cry in horror the next? This is actually a truly groundbreaking film. Groundbreaking but also, what the hell did I just watch!? Groundbreaking/what the hell did I just watch!? about sums it up really. \n\nThe cast are great and the script is well-written and the film looks good and blah, blah- blah, once you start watching it you'll be too gobsmacked to even try and look at such things critically.

            "content": "If we didn't spend our entire lives searching for bliss, we wouldn't have a reason to live.  Happiness is a driving force in humanity - it's the emotion we most eagerly turn to time and time again, after times of anger, sadness, and yes, even happiness.  Once we experience elation, there's never a moment in which we don't want to feel it again.  It's much too addictive to pass up, like an ice cold Diet Coke on an afternoon in mid-July or a cup of hot cocoa following a long winter walk.\n\tBut alas, not everyone is equipped with an endless supply of dopamine - some, unfortunately, are more fruitful in their ecstasy than others.  1998's \"Happiness,\" written and directed by black comedy master Todd Solondz, is about that small percentage of individuals, who either spend their days putting on a happy face in order to be culturally accepted or succumb to their misery.  \n\tA film so downbeat in its storytelling strategies should be unattractive - I'm sure most would prefer to sit through something delightful like \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\" - but Solondz isn't the type to drown in his own death wishes a la Michelangelo Antonioni.  He, instead, sees the twisted humor in the widespread suffering of his characters, looking at mini-tragedies such as disappointingly uninterested one-night-stands, unfulfilling work experiences, and joyless sex lives as if they were sitcom tropes.  Imagine one of those funny scenes in a \"Friends\" or a \"Seinfeld\" where someone says the wrong thing, where the wrong character shows up at the wrong time, where the wrong outcome is produced.  This time, though, the comedy isn't bright - it's bruising.\n\tWhat Solondz's goal is is hard to say.  Is he interested in creating a social satire specifically pointing a finger at the white upper-middle class? A character study that focuses on unlucky - some terrible - people who crave contentment but will possibly never find it? Here, we aren't so pressed to find out.  We can only watch in inexplicable hypnotization as we decide whether to laugh, to cry, or to wince.  If we're lucky, maybe we'll experience all three.\n\t\"Happiness\" circles around three sisters, Joy (Jane Adams), Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle), and Trish (Cynthia Stevenson).  When we first meet Joy, meek and kind-hearted, she is in the process of dumping a self-pitying loser (Jon Lovitz) who verbally abuses her for not reciprocating his premature love.  Nearing thirty and completely aimless, Joy causes alarm in Trish, a cheerful housewife married to Bill (Dylan Baker), a therapist by day and a child molester by night.  Trish is the kind of woman who believes you won't amount to much if you aren't married and are without kids; Bill is the kind of man smart enough to know what a horrible person he is while still being too stupid to control himself.  Helen, the most successful of the sisters, is a well-off poet tired of the endless praise from love interests, literary critics, and the public.  She craves disappointment, to feel like she isn't good enough for once.\n\tAlso connected to this cast of thoroughly messed up characters are Allen (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a mouth-breathing pervert who tells his therapist (who just so happens to be Bill) of his wildest sexual fantasies but is only confident enough to briefly shout them out to anonymous women on the telephone (two callers just so happen to be Joy and Helen; Helen is also his neighbor); Mona (Louise Lasser) and Lenny (Ben Gazzara), the long-married parents of the sisters whose relationship is shattered after Lenny calls for separation in order to achieve much desired \"alone time\"; and Billy (Rufus Read), Bill and Trish's awkward preteen son more concerned with climaxing for the first time than with any other sort of middle-school based emotional issues.\n\t\"Happiness\" is a challenging film.  Apart from the sympathetic Adams, who has a presence timid enough to make you want to give her a bear hug, the ensemble is comprised of characters not conventionally likable or unlikable; they exist in a middle-ground of average, monstrously selfish one moment and sympathetic the next.  These are people we'd meet on the street, appearing convincingly mild-mannered in the scope of a glimpse.  But once doors close and fears are amplified, they turn into relatable, if not pathetic, connoisseurs of depression, searching for happiness but unsure of where exactly to find it.  \n\tCovering their self-hatred is a visible irony represented by pastel colors and interludes of sitcom-ready orchestral music; when one traumatic scene ends, we can expect Solondz to transition to the next as if a jaw-drop is normal, as if a disturbing confessional is a witty one-liner in disguise.  He is the finest director of black comedy I've ever seen - everything about \"Happiness\" should be dead serious.  And yet, we find ourselves laughing in-between grimaces, a description more literal than any other time I've used it.  \n\tIt's not an easy film, but there's something consuming about the way it explores the underbellies of what's considered \"normal\" in American society; what happens when the all-American dad is actually a serial rapist, when the successful author yearns for unanimous panning that will never arrive, when the 60-something married couple destroys the idea that marriage can last a lifetime by proclaiming boredom? The sly subversion of \"Happiness\" is what makes it such an excellent film - but I can only recommend it to the most cynical of viewers.  Most will be unsure what they should be thinking.  Even I don't know.",

            "content": "Happiness is what I would call a pretty disturbing film, but I mean it in the very best of ways. It examines its subject matter not with violence and hysteria, but with words and behaviour. It was heavily criticised on release due to its controversial themes, but when you attempt to depict a subject matter such as paedophilia, there's no way you're going to do it without upsetting someone. Todd Solondz bravely tackles issues such as loneliness, dissatisfaction, maturity and child molestation head-on, highlighting how they affect both the sufferer and those around them. The acting is fantastic, especially from Dylan Baker. With a sexual attraction to children getting the better of him, Baker portrays his character as restrained and in control, but always on the edge. What's so admirable about the films approach is it doesn't deny that what he's doing is morally reprehensible and has no place in modern society, always showing the damage that he is doing, but it doesn't make it seem like he does it out of a will to cause pain. He's just a man with a sickening compulsion that threatens to destroy him. This storyline is the emotional highlight of the film, but all the others work too, especially when you have master character actor Philip Seymour Hoffman on the cast list. All these characters want is to find their own happiness in an unforgiving world, and the film shows how that can often be a journey paved with misery and ridicule.",

Their lives intersect with pedophiles and masturbating prank phone-callers.  \n\nFunny in a pitch-black way and surprisingly moving, the film undercuts our images of happiness and explores the ways in which we perhaps deny ourselves true happiness by denying some basic aspect of our identity or by not accepting other people for who they are. \n\nNot for the squeamish or easily offended, Happiness is independent cinema at its finest: unapologetic, in-your-face, and totally original.",

            "content": "Ahahahaha. Man. This movie is hilarious and bleak. This is one of the darkest dark comedies ever made. There aren't many movies that so forthrightly deal with such disturbing subject matter; and yet, somehow, the movie is very funny. It's hard to say exactly how, as the movie never goes for gags or punchlines and never seems to overtly mock its absolutely wretched characters. And yet it made me laugh, somehow. Perhaps just its willingness to go straight ahead into scenes totally unlike anything ever made before is what made me laugh.\n\nIt's one of those movies with a large ensemble cast and several intersecting plotlines, like Robert Altman's Short Cuts or Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia. At the core of the movie is a group of three sisters. One of the sisters (Jane Adams) puts on a brave face but just cannot seem to find any sort of success, professionally or personally. Another (Lara Flynn Boyle) is a writer who feels like she's a fraud, and is being stalked by her perverted neighbor (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who likes to call random women from the phonebook and masturbate. The third sister (Cynthia Stevenson) thinks she has the perfect little suburban life, but little does she know her husband (Dylan Baker) likes to molest little boys. A few other characters weave into and out of the story.\n\nThis might be the only comedy I can think of that features child molestation, multiple rapes, murder, suicide, masturbation, and very explicit discussions of all of the above. Every time you think, \"No, the movie can't possibly go there,\" it goes there, and then just keeps going and going. It seems impossible to believe this movie was actually funded by anyone, and yet there it is. The acting is all excellent, especially by Hoffman and Baker as two sad, but different, perverts. This is one of the earliest major roles for Hoffman, and shows what an incredible actor he already was before we really knew about him. Baker is incredibly good in this movie, though the nature of his part might make it easier to see why he hasn't been cast in too many starring roles since. Jane Adams is also brilliant here. \nThis is the second film I've seen by Todd Solondz, after the similarly dark and satirical (though less extreme) Welcome to the Dollhouse. It definitely makes me curious to see where he could have possibly gone from here, though I know he does have several other films. On the basis of the two films, Solondz is a solid director and an unbelievably nervy writer, one who genuinely isn't afraid to do anything. This is not a movie I would recommend watching with your family, or anyone else really. But you should still watch it all the same. Also, it has a nice little closing credits song sung by Michael Stipe, so that's a fun bonus.",

Happiness is an ensemble drama that skips around between multiple storylines. Three sisters; a young women socially isolated seeking relationships, another happily married with a psychiatrist husband and three kids. Unfortunately, her husband develops an unnatural fascination for his 11 year old son's male classmate, fantasizes about mass killing in a park, and masturbates to teen magazines. One of his patients, Allen (Seymour Hoffman) has a fascination for the third sister who desperately wants to be raped. Meanwhile, the apparently stable 40 year marriage of the sister's parents suddenly unravels when he decides he has had enough and wants to be alone. The lives of these people are all connected by the desire for happiness, often from immoral, dark sources. The only situation that seems out of place is the conversation in a diner where a lady admits to Allen about murdering someone. Clearly this is a film not for everyone due to the disturbing subject matters, it's the zenith of the darkest of dark humor. Fantastic all around performances by a formidable cast, especially Dylan Baker and Seymour Hoffman",

Director Todd Solondz takes the viewer on an extraordinary journey, and it's incredibly profound, amusing, and most certainly unforgettable. He makes punchlines out of misery and pedophilia while eventually arriving at a touching and tragic vision of humanity. It is distressing and utterly hilarious at the same time, and the performances across the board are simply fantastic. \n\n\"Happiness\" is an ensemble piece of five different stories, all of which intersect from time to time. The film concerns the lives of several related New Jersey residents--a sexually frustrated professional (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a pedophile psychologist (Dylan Baker), his blissfully delusional wife (Cynthia Stevenson), their 11-year-old son (Rufus Read) who's concerned with his inability to ejaculate, an unhappy older couple (Ben Gazzara, Louise Lasser), and others. Self-centeredness is the chief characteristic of nearly everyone in this film.\n\nAt two hours and 20 minutes,\"Happiness\" rambles a bit, but the strength of these characters is undeniable. The film strongly benefits for thoroughly realized characters and relationships along with Solondz's masterful ability to switch the tone from comic to tragic at the drop of a dime. We experience empathy for the kind of people we would ordinarily feel uncomfortable around. Solondz does not judge his characters, he doesn't excuse them, and he doesn't reduce them to wicked villains or victims. He simply sees them, and he invites us to do the same.",

She's considered too much of a catch in an ensemble that includes a stepford pedophile (a truly disturbing Dylan Baker), a prank-calling masturbator (the great Philip Seymour Hoffman), and a family of fake smiles, obnoxious housewives, elderly divorcees, and pretentious poets. Yeah.\n\nAnd Todd Solondz divvies into chapters eyefuls of each tale in \"Happiness\" before ultimately bringing them together, sort of, in the way moving up in this world only foreshadows responsibilities we can't fulfill and challenges it sounds like shit to face. \"Magnolia\" this is not. How can we expect to be happy to no end when life HAS an end? It's less trouble to just die alone and soon. \n\nFear not because, oh yeah, \"Happiness\" is hilarious as all hell. Solondz's movie is one made entirely of the awkward cliffhangers in two-bit conversations. It ignores when silences come up and presses on, going so far you'll be more than squirming in your seat, not being able to make a good fist.\n\nIf you thought \"American Beauty\" and \"Little Children\" tried your patience enough for sticky embarrassment at home, \"Happiness\" is not for you. It's broken, yucky, and doesn't behave. Solondz knows where there's smoke there's fire, and he's given his film a black hole of a core that bleeds, and that you can't get rid of.

Lacking anything redeemable, this film is an exercise in futility.\n\nSeemingly going through the motions only, the story builds zero empathy. Having antagonistic characters in the role of protagonists doesn't make them more relatable, it makes them seem disconnected. The point that writer/director Todd Solondz is trying to make is apparent, it just doesn't work.\n\nSolondz is trying to push our buttons. He's trying to make us realize there are bad people out there, not in the shadows, but living among us. Of course we all know this, but the degree this film goes to make that point comes across as painfully labored.\n\nBill Maplewood, played by Dylan Baker, is an uptight shrink and part time pedophile. He has a seemingly idyllic life: Successful career, loving wife, great kids. All the trappings of milquetoast suburban bliss have been achieved. If not for the image of him in his car jerking off to a teen magazine, we'd think he was Dick Van Dyke. \n\nWhat's going on is comically obvious, but the script relentlessly tries to raise the stakes with a character that we've taken no emotional investment in. It doesn't work. The deliberately awkward (and numerous) conversations with his preteen son about the birds and the bees are hackneyed at best, depraved at worst. \n\nThe fact that these conversations keeps popping up serves no purpose. By the time he has a tearful confessional with his son, we're over it. Yet another awkward conversation with his son, about the penis, has lost all meaning by this point. A tearful confessional with his wife would have been much more rewarding, but this film seems to deliberately avoid rewarding the viewer.\n\nBill is just one of the emotionally bankrupt characters in this piece. Allen, (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a prank-calling masturbator who's apparently incapable if communicating with any other human beings. Eye contact and conversation are foreign concepts to this introverted shut-in who stalks his neighbor. \n\nAt one point, the neighbor (Lara Flynn Boyle) seems to enjoy his filthy, anonymous phone calls. Then, using the tired cliche of the horny and lonely middle-aged woman, she turns the tables and begins to stalk him. A meeting finally takes place and once again, nothing happens. Just more awkwardness. This film thrives in it.\n\nOf course there are many other characters that this film inelegantly tries to tie together in a bizarre love trapezoid. That's right, all the story-lines are linked... needlessly. \n\nThe shrink's wife is the sister of the horny neighbor, whose other sister is a peckish and shy wallflower, whose parents are splitting up. Any kind of backstory or explanation isn't even attempted. Apparently, they live miserable lives just because that's life. Hence the ironic title, \"Happiness.\" Get it?\n\nI'm curious as to how this film garnered so much acclaim. This seems to be one of those films that critics claim to like only to not be labeled as uptight. The thought process being that a good review means you are one hip and groovy film critic. \n\nNormally, I myself would be tempted to look at a film such as this and applaud it for making us face the ugliness that's all around us. There's something noble about addressing our fears and pushing boundaries. However, there has to be something even slightly compelling or endearing in order to make that possible. Unfortunately, this film lacks either of those qualities.",

This film brings about shock and, at parts, even intense discomfort, yet it still manages to carry across a profound message about life and happiness to its viewers.
