            "content": "To be a teenage girl when the Spice Girls were around, there was no better time to be 12. I admit it, I was such a fan of the girl power group. How could you not be? Admit it, you say you hated them, but secretly you had a poster of Ginger Spice in your closet. They were cute, they were fun, they were talented and before you knew it they were gone. But for 2 years, it was nothing but girl power! So out of the height of their fame we naturally had to see if the Spice Girls were good for something else and that meant a movie! The Spice Girls made a movie, to show how crazy their lives were at the time and let them just have fun with it and they did spice up our lives real good.The Spice Girls are enjoying their fame, but they become dissatisfied with the burdens of it. A sinister newspaper owner, Kevin McMaxford, is trying to ruin the girls' reputation in order to cash in on the headlines, and even dispatches a photographer to take pictures and tape recordings of the girls. Annoying film director, Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth, who stalks the band along with his crew, hoping to use them as documentary subjects; at the same time, the girls' manager, Clifford, is fending off two overeager Hollywood writers, Martin Barnfield and Graydon, who relentlessly pitch absurd plot ideas for the girls' film. Amid this, the girls must prepare for a concert at the Albert Hall, their biggest performance yet. But between all this craziness, would they even want to continue to sing at the price of their friendships? You'll have to see, but I'm sure you could figure it out.I think a lot of people are a little too harsh on this film, the girls gave it a genuine try. You can tell they just had fun and wanted to do this for the fans. I think there were actually some really funny parts, like when they went through the spice boot camp. The whole last scene where they are going through their action scene in London, it's so random and just a good time. See, what I liked about this film was it's harmless nature. It was made for the fans specifically because we loved them so much. I admit that I'll watch it every once in a while still just to go back down memory lane and it still brings a smile on my face. The songs are so darn catchy, I can't help it. There are some very fun cameos that get a good giggle. The story is very predictable and the movie is over the top silly, but that is what makes it fun. I'm here to defend the film, I think people over analyze things way too much. Sometimes, you can't explain it, but you just want to let go of the real world and spice up your life a little bit. The Spice Girls may never win an Oscar, but they won the world's hearts for 2 short years, the girl power may have fizzled a little, but I'll take a trip down memory lane any time for Spice World.6/10",

            "content": "I've liked the Spice Girls for years, but I'm not sure why. Ordinarily, I don't care for their brand of dance-pop fluff, but somehow they make it sound good. Regardless of what anyone says, they are talented singers and dancers, and they show that numerous times. They're also pretty and most of them wear outfits that show a lot. And while they're not accomplished actresses, they are simply adorable.I don't think anyone intended this movie to be taken seriously. It's just good clean (well, slightly naughty) fun. Roger Moore comes the closest to giving a good performance, in a role that appears to be spoofing Bond villains. Just in case we don't get the joke, he pets a long-haired cat. One of the funniest scenes has the girls complaining about people thinking they fit the stereotypical image people have of them. Of course, Emma says this while on a swing in a three-year-old's fantasy world.The girls actually show they have intelligence. Or do they? I thought Melanie B was the one with brains. She's no better off than the others!Another humorous incident: Victoria can't make up her mind whether to wear the short black Gucci dress or the short black Gucci dress. Emma suggests she wear the short black Gucci dress. Problem solved! Of course, the girls are being harassed by the tabloids, whose top personnel are shown being evil.And then there are the guys pitching their idea for a Spice Girls movie. Some of what we see is supposedly their imagination. Including a Dukes of Hazzard style incident with a bus, which was done so cheaply it's obviously not real. In the closing credits, the girls are actually more talented delivering dialogue because they are being themselves, not merely playing exaggerated versions of themselves. I've never seen communication with the movie audience quite like this! It's not for people looking for Shakespeare. But if you want to laugh and hear music that is bubbly and upbeat, this is pretty good.",

Playing themselves (albeit slightly exaggerated) seems to be a stretch.  The lone shining star as far as acting is Meat Loaf, who in his role as SpiceBus driver provides comedy release without being Jar-Jarish.  The fact he delivers the line \"hey I love these girls, and I'd do anything for them...but I won't do that...\" without blushing is priceless.This movie has some of the cheesiest scenes in the history of film, with the aliens scene being among the worst, but when this movie hits with the goofiness, it hits well.  I still laugh to this day when I think of the plastic SpiceBus jumping over the plastic London Bridge.  Surprisingly, one of the best musical numbers is the cafe scene...where the girls show that they actually do have some discernible talent.This is the best summary of the movie I can give:  I hated the Spice Girls until I saw this movie, and now I have to say that I actually own a CD of theirs",

After they split up and weren't cool anymore, everyone forgot about the movie. But ho, ho, what's this? Years later, here I am cleaning out my old Disney and Barney videos and stumble across my old friend that I used to watch everyday. Even at my old age of fifteen, never failed to crack me up.Obviously, this isn't meant to be a contender for Oscars. Anyone can see that. But I can't find much to hate about a movie that's practically the visual to go along with the song \"Girls just wanna have fun.\" That's all it is, fun. And a lot of good fun at that. It's just a guilty pleasure, and it's so much fun to watch it with old friends singing into hair brushes and wearing feather boas. You just need to keep in mind that it was publicity for their new record and it's not meant to be one of those heavy movies you over-analyze. Recommendation: This movie is much funner when you watch it jumping up and down on a couch like a seven year old.",

            "content": "Bob Spiers had worked in British TV for years - Bottom, Fawlty Towers and Absolutely Fabulous of the shows that he directed - before he was asked to direct the movie of the Spice Girls. He had no idea what they looked like and turned the job down until Jennifer Saunders told him that he should take it.If you want to be snooty and say that the Spice Girls didn't mean anything, they were the first act to reach number one with their first six singles, as well as the first to debut at #1 in the UK charts five times in a row. And this movie, despite critical savagery, is still the highest-grossing movie of all time by a musical group.At once embracing the pop culture that spawned them and thumbing their noses at it, Spice World is, well, about the Spice Girls avoiding bad press from newspaper owner Kevin McMaxford (Barry Humphries, who is also Dame Edna) and his photographer henchman Damien (Richard O'Brien). There's also a camera crew led by Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth (Alan Cumming) and two constantly on-the-pitch Hollywood writers George Wendt and Mark McKinney) who want to make a movie about the band.The band is also playing Royal Albert Hall while making time for their mutual best friend, who is due to have a child any day now. That's really all it's about, but I'm certain that their audience was happy to come see the film and hear 15 of their songs in the theater.The reason for people who may not enjoy the band to see this is because it's so delightfully weird and well casted, with Roger Moore as the secretive head of their recording label and cameos from Elton John, Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry, Bon Geldof and more.This movie also reunited Rocky Horror alums Meat Loaf and O'Brien, as well as O'Brien with his Shock Treatment co-star Humphries.Perhaps what's most interesting is what isn't in this movie. Any mentions of Princess Diana and Gianni Versace were edited out after their deaths, as was a cameo by Gary Glitter.Beyond having Moore in this, I kind of love that when the Spice Girls' bus jumps the bridge, a similar slide whistle sound as the jump in The Man With the Golden Gun is heard. Victoria also dresses up as Honey Ryder from Dr. No.Maybe you weren't around for the Spice Girls. Maybe you were and couldn't deal. Either way, you should still check this out. I mean, even as a lifelong metalhead, I could find things to enjoy here.",

That woman is indeed a great -and underrated- comedian, I wish (no pun intended) she was acknowledged for that. The rest of the girls are just adorable. Loved the singing bits, songs and reworks from their hit singles we all love are performed.\nThe film satirises their rose to fame and everyday life while at the peak of SpiceMania.

It's a cheesy movie full of cheesy jokes. It's not supposed to be an academy award winner. It should be the first of the genre \"Cheesy for the sake of being Cheesy\". I mean, if Meatloaf voluntarily in this movie, we all know that it's not to be taken seriously. Mr. \"Bat-Out-Of-Hell\" himself wouldn't be in one of these movies to try and earn his acting credibility. Love this movie for what it is. A cheesy good laugh to watch if you're depressed.",

As a child and massive fan I found the film entertaining as it was to cracked up to be, it was all the phenomenon of the time. Looking back now it was a great time for me enjoying it and themselves as a girl group enjoying massive success and this is why I can accept why the film may not be any BAFTA hands down winner, obviously the film was never meant to be! It was written by their managers wife! And has too many more than subtle references about Britain. The acting is cheesy but no way did it tarnish any of the many important actors/comedians/singers who cameo'd in this film because as I remember Richard E. Grant saying it was just so great to be part of the experience, it really was a time-line in history. Now who cares whether he was lying or being honest we know he is an actor who gets paid big bucks, but the fact Roger Moore was in this film and Meatloaf, I don't think you can call them all sellouts. Fact is Spice Girls did make an impact on us all, this is just a bit of history left to show their mark.",

            "review_title": "Much better & much funnier than you'd think",
            "content": "This movie is FUN. And the sad thing is that most people are too close-minded to see that. The general consensus seems to be: \"It's the Spice Girls in a movie? It's going to be awful!\" and either they never see the movie, or they allow their prejudices to judge the movie for them.Firstly, let me say that I am not, and was never, a Spice Girls fan. I was way too old for their target market when they were popular, and whilst one or two of their songs had catchy tunes, some were downright annoying. They were a very cleverly manufactured girl band in a time when that market was wide-open. Giving each girl a distinctive character and style was a stroke of genius on the part of their 'creators', and while they didn't have particularly strong voices (except perhaps for Mel C), they didn't have particularly bad ones either. I've heard far worse. So I went into this movie purely out of curiosity, expecting it to be somewhere between awful and merely silly, but I ended up enjoying myself thoroughly. Also, my 65-year-old father loves this movie, and he saw it only having heard vaguely of the Spice Girls, but not knowing their music at all. Yes, Spiceworld is an exploitation movie; BUT it does an excellent job at it! What I loved most was the way it poked fun at itself all the way through. The character of the screenwriter pitching his idea to the girls' manager (brilliantly played by Richard E. Grant) saying \"It's obvious to us that the Spicegirls are movie stars!\", when it's obvious that they're not, and everyone knows it - there's even a scene at the beginning where he says, \"Yes, but can they ACT?\" and his boss responds with, 'Who cares?\", or similar. I loved that. And while the girls CAN'T really act (some are worse than others; I've read that Victoria was the only one who had taken acting lessons before, but I can't say it showed since I thought she was the weakest link), it's obvious that they're having fun with the script, and they don't do too badly at all.The script was another great surprise to me; it's full of good lines and funny characters that poke fun at themselves and their stereotypes. An example of this is the great Roger Moore playing the \"Chief\", who is presumably the Big Boss of the Spice Girls. We only ever see him on the phone with Clifford the manager (Richard E. Grant), and every time we do he is stroking, in pure Bond Villain (or Dr Evil) fashion, a small white animal on his lap. But every time you see him he has a different animal; first it's a cat, then a rabbit, a tiny white pig etc. I thought that was such a great way of poking fun at the stereotype of the villain always having a white pet. And then the character himself has these fantastically enigmatic, senseless, but hysterical lines, like: \"When the rabbit of chaos is pursued by the ferret of disorder through the fields of anarchy, it is time to hang your pants on the hook of darkness. Whether they're clean or not.\" and: \"The headless chicken can only know where he's been. He can't see where he's going. Do not be that chicken.\" I love that off-the-wall humour, and this movie is full of it. Of course, some people just don't GET that kind of humour, which is fine by me as long as it doesn't make them slam the film because of it.Other moments I love, which elevate this film from could-have-been-dodgy to funny, are the casting of Meatloaf as the Spice Girls bus driver, and then having him say lines like: {on fixing the clogged toilets} \"Hey, I love these girls. I'll do anything for them...but I won't do that!\" - which is, of course, a play on Meatloaf's hit song \"Anything for Love\". Also the parody of the stereotypical characters of the girls, which of course were made up for them anyway, like Victoria not knowing what to wear, and Mel C saying \"It must be really hard for you, Victoria, trying to decide whether to wear the little Gucci dress, or the little Gucci dress, or the little Gucci dress\", and Victoria responding \"Exactly!\", or when Victoria falls into the Thames and continues to scream for help once she's been rescued, and yelling \"This dress is dry-clean only!\", or Geri saying \"Calm down, haven't you ever heard of the word 'compromisation'?\" There are scores of these great moments but they really work better in the film than if I wrote them down here. All I'm saying is that this movie is not ever in a million years as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Yes, it's not the greatest, but then most films aren't. It's so much funnier than you'd think, and yes it has its cheesy moments, but sometimes it's SUPPOSED to be cheesy! That's where it's funny. I really don't understand why this film, whose only aim was to be FUN, and in this it succeeded more than admirably in my opinion, is in IMDb's Worst.",

If you're old enough to remember M-TV when it was actually JUST a music video channel, this is what SPICEWORLD is (think of the classic Michael Jackson video/movies like THRILLER where it was music and a bit of story tossed in for good measure). Nope, not Oscar\u0099 material by a long shot, but still quite enjoyable.Oh yes... one last thing: I saw this movie on PPV in 1998 and immediately fell in love with it and the Spice Girls.

            "content": "In the 1990's, the Spice Girls were the reigning queens of pop, selling countless amounts of records across the world.  An unprecedented marketing blitz followed, culminating in the film \"Spice World.\"  Backlash was inevitable, and many were ready to dismiss the film or praise the film solely based on their dislike or enjoyment of the Spice Girls' music.  When reviewed as a film in its own right, \"Spice World\" is a very entertaining movie with its tongue always firmly in its meta-textual cheek.The Spice Girls -- Geri Halliwell (Ginger), Melanie Brown (Scary), Emma Bunton (Baby), Melanie Chisholm (Sporty), and Victoria Adams (Posh, now Victoria Beckham) -- play themselves.  The Girls are getting ready for their first live concert in Royal Albert Hall, but their preparation is beset with several obstacles, including the overdue pregnancy of the Girls' best friend (\"AbFab\"'s Naoko Mori) and a vicious tabloid editor (Barry Humphries) that wants to see them ruined so he can the ensuing headlines will sell millions of papers.  A host of supporting characters add to the mix, including the Girls' high-strung manager (Richard Grant), an insidious paparazzo (Richard O'Brien), a clueless documentary film-maker (Alan Cumming), and a Hollywood producer/screenwriter duo (George Wendt/Mark McKinney) relentless pitching ideas to the Girls' manager for movie spin-offs.The Girls do play themselves to a point, but they are more accurately playing themselves as the public sees them.  Sporty is always on an exercise bike, for instance, and Baby is never without a lollipop or stuffed animal. They live up to their stereotypes and play them to the ultimate hilt.  The Girls themselves seem relaxed, with the most confident performance coming from Geri, who seems quite natural on the screen.  Mel B and Emma both seem almost as relaxed, but Mel C seems like she needs a little more coaching on screen presence.  Victoria, unfortunately, looks quite uncomfortable whenever the camera focuses on her, and in some scenes she actually comes off as resentful that she had to star in this film.The director, Bob Spiers, is best known perhaps for his work on the series \"Absolutely Fabulous\", and he brings the same comic hand to this film has he did to that supremely funny show.  The comedy is played light, never too much over-the-top, although a good deal of silliness is inserted.  Dramatic moments are often muted by a small joke or bit of campy melodrama.  Nothing is ever taken too seriously, and the film clips along at a good pace, peppered with hilarious fantasy sequences, knowing self-parody, and satirical jabs at everything from hospital drama to action movie car chases.The film is full of cameos as well, including both musicians and non-musicians.  Elvis Costello turns up as a bartender, while Meatloaf plays the driver of the Spice Bus (a double-decker bus emblazoned with SPICE on its roof).  Jennifer Saunders shows up as a bitchy fashionista, while Bob Hoskins' role is too funny to give away here.It's easy to see why some people dislike the film, however.  The soundtrack tries to fit as many Spice Girls songs as possible into the film, which is to be expected, but the songs themselves are of a wildly varying quality, from the rousing \"Spice Up Your Life\" to the questionable \"Viva Forever.\" It's also hard to buy the Girls' backstory as struggling musicians, and the film lacks any kind of dramatic tension, which may be intentional, but it gives the film a fluffy quality that does not appeal to everybody.  Some moments in the film now seem oddly indicative of future events: about a year of the release, Geri would leave the group and the Girls' next album without her would signal the end of the act, with all the Girls going on to solo careers of amazingly diverse success (Geri and Mel C have score the best, while nobody wants to hear Victoria's album, ever).  Keep this in mind during the fantasy sequence with Stephen Fry as a square judge.All in all, \"Spice World\" is a very entertaining diversion. It's a pop song in film format: it's airy, fun, and slightly mindless, but for a while you forget about your worries.  Certainly not as bad as people have made it out to be, but one to avoid if you really just don't like the Spice Girls.  7 out of 10.",

These are the greatest pop legends of the 90's, Girl Power shook the world and so of course they were gonna exploit it for all their worth, but the thing that makes this pop band movie so much better than any other are the cameos, the list is endless.Its got more start turns than an Austin Powers movie, and thats saying something, and great thing is everyone has a sense of humour about their own position, even the girls themselves.I grew up with the Spice Girls and was a major fan - I'm 19 now but watching it now i find it even funnier - cos now i understand the jokes that flew over my head 8 years ago, and i know exactly who all these brilliant actors and musicians who make their cameos.It has great lines, a great and beautiful cast and shows the lives of the spice girls at their most normal and bizarre at the height of their fame, for the young girls the world over who loved the spice girls this is a great film to bring back the memories of almost 10 years ago.A must for fans - avoid if you had no love for these girls",

The Spice girls should stick to singing, but not in the movies!! They sounded absolutely awful, and I got really sick of hearing all of the same songs that I've been hearing for the past few years. They had only 1 unreleased song in that whole movie!! The opening credits had the theater in hysterics though, it was soooo cheesy!! I don't know why George Wendt, Mark McKinney and so many others were in this, they really didn't have any real purpose in the movie, the producers probably could have saved a little bit of money and hired some absolute no-namers to play the exact same parts!! And the whole Alien scene. Come on now, that was way too dumb, even for my cheesy self. The last fifteen minutes was the most entertaining. The main thing this movie does prove, is that the Spice Girls are easy on the eyes, and that they have GREAT shoes!! I'd say that if you are over 15, you should steer clear of this movie, unless you're a Spice fan, and you are REALLY inebriated!! although I did give it a 10/10. Cuz I was Really inebriated when I watched it!!",

That's because instead of having actors and a plot, the film plays like a giant advertisement for this prefabricated \"super group\". In other words, the cynical folks who brought us this \"film\" were basically trying to squeeze every last drop from the franchise and sell more records. Fortunately for the world, the group was already on their way out and the film made much more of a fizzle than a sizzle at the box office (thank God).As with other vanity products, the actors really cannot act and have the charisma of cheese. While I know this may sound like sacrilege to some, this is a lot like Paul McCartney's vanity opus, GIVE MY REGARDS TO BROADSTREET. Like this other film, lots of glitzy locales, special guest stars and noise were all used to try to hide the fact that the singers were not all that talented as actresses. Had all the glitz been removed, you would have been left with...well...nothing. So, instead there are a billion costume changes, crazy sets and pointless cameos--all to hide the utter vapid nature of the film. Overall, a total waste of time for anyone but a Spice Girl zombie-fan. I saw it because I am a masochist--otherwise, don't bother.",

            "content": "Between the ages of 9 and 11, the Spice Girls were my favourite pop group, which was a legitimate enough reason to see this film. It was the first film I ever saw at the then-new Virgin Cinema (now a Cineworld) in Spytty Park, Newport, South Wales and I have loved it ever since. Within the following year when the video was released, I was in my now-defunct local Woolworth's with my mother and sister and when my mother asked if I wanted her to buy this movie on video, it was an offer I couldn't refuse. I have watched it several times when I was younger but not in recent years because the video is in my bed drawer with the bed drawer side to the wall (like my 'Charlie's Angels' movie DVD) so I decided to rent the DVD after not having seen the film for as long as I could remember. It's as excellent today as it's always been and upon watching this today, I spotted a few things that I hadn't noticed in previous viewings such as Mel B styling Bob Geldof's hair at a party, Jonathan Ross interviewing the girls early in the film and Barry Humphries playing the hot-headed newspaper editor Kevin McMaxford.While this film has lines that are silly and make no sense (such as Clifford's hair-in-plug holes announcement) and a cheap-looking scene of the Spice Bus jumping over the Tower Bridge as the girls rush to their concert, the dialogue is memorable and funny in parts, the cinematography is suitably varied, the editing is straightforward yet effective, the pacing is swift and the acting is just right with the Spice Girls truly allowing their personalities to shine, particularly Emma and Victoria (who smiles a bit more here than people may think). Despite some of the songs having different instrumentations than one would normally hear, the music is a essential asset to this romp and it was a good idea for the Spice Girls to use their second album Spiceworld as the main soundtrack and there were even some delights from their debut album Spice. The incidental music may be rarely used but it included a groovy piece when we first see the girls' pregnant friend Nicola and creepy, tense music when the bald photographer steps out of the toilet for example. Although the Spice Girls are the main stars here, there was fantastic support from Meat Loaf (who references one of his songs before the girls encounter some aliens) as Dennis the Spice Bus driver, Richard E Grant as Clifford, Naoko Mori as Nicola and Claire Rushbrook as Deborah plus more celebrity cameos from the likes of Elton John as himself, Michael Barrymore as Mr Step and Stephen Fry as the judge.Overall, this is an excellent musical comedy that didn't deserve the Razzie it received. 10/10.",

Every \"drama\" scene drains the movie of any fun shown before. Half way into the film it becomes really bad.  Frankly I felt the director said, \"We got their money, who cares what they see next?\"  Then the film becomes a cheap montage of lousy sets and action. What is truly sad is that the Spice Girls do have talent and actually interesting personalities.  They deserved a good movie to showcase their skills.  And this movie dragged them off the stage.  I was a fan and I felt exploited and insulted by this worthless film.  I hate the Spice Girls because of this film.  It bluntly stated, \"We feel our fans are idiots. They'll gladly buy any cheap item we drop in their laps.\" This movie has made me disgusted with the Spice Girls.  They obviously care as little for their fans as they did with their careers.

It presents a muddled premise that plays off many dimwitted subplots. Title regards influence as if the world really needs more Spice Girls. We see the Spice Girls in concert, bizarre movie ideas, unsatisfied reporters, media problems, signing autographs for aliens, and yes, a childbirth scene. Just what is this nonsense about? Directed like a bad music video by Bob Spiers who previously gave the world the horrible remake of That Darn Cat. With that film being a total waste of film it is obvious that lightning strikes twice and this poor sap gets struck with a second terrible film choice. The only difference here is that he gets to direct five reasonably attractive women who cannot act. The film is colorful to look at but not pleasant to experience. Despite their popularity The Spice Girls cannot act nor lip synch their own music. They are colorful in their flashy outfits as well as being attractive to boot, but that doesn't carry their performances above embarrassment. Plus we have a variety of celebrity cameos who had nothing better to do than sign onto this piece of crap. If you are looking to spice up your world then I recommend the weather channel and leave this film to suffer in its own defeat. Score: 2 / 10",

Wait, backing up, why the hell would anyone think this was a good idea?It's hard to pinpoint the most ridiculous and awful part of this over-complicated, and yet, plot less film. Was it the aliens that the girls could understand because of the subtitles? Was it the doctor on holiday when a baby just appears after birth? Was it the toilet photographer? Was it the Dr Who bus? Was it the Rocky theme for a half a dozen steps? Was it the neglecting-the-pregnant-friend morning scene so they could train sing at fruity boot camp? Was it Bond's sad turn as Blofeld? Was it the dozens of called in favors from the guest appearances? Was it the girls breaking the fourth wall in the end credits and, incredibly, believing there were more than one person in the audience? Was it the two teen fans that looked even less interested in spending time with the Spice Girls than anyone watching this even when they're playfully thrown from a random boat?My excuse for watching this terrible plea to buy their CDs was that I listen to the How Did This Get Made podcast and it's all-but pointless listening to that hilarious podcast if you haven't seen the movie they make fun of on their show. I cannot wait to hear what they have to say about this. (I actually have a good idea as I watched this film.)Basically we have five girlfriend singers who are stalked by an amateur documentary maker, sabotaged by a tabloid editor, yelled at by their manager, fantasized by the movie-within-the-movie director/writer and made to feel guilty by a random, yet never explained, pregnant friend. Mercifully \u2013 not really, but I do try to be positive at times \u2013 the girls keep on rocking and remain BFFs for-eve-r!How on Earth did this make From Justin to Kelly look comprehensible?My guess, this movie began the downfall of the group and even if you're a die-hard fan to the end, spare yourself from this dreadful pile of donkey's discharge.* * * Final thoughts: Admittedly, I actually attended a Spice Girls concert once, back in the 1990s. Personally, I only liked 2-3 of their songs (still do,) but not enough to see them in concert. But, for a friend who absolutely loved them, I bought two tickets for us to go since he was feeling down. For whatever reason, he couldn't go and he sent me with his boyfriend who also liked them. It was literally one of the most painful experiences I've had\u0085that is, up until I saw this movie. After showing up a ton late, the girls played a dozen or so songs I'd never heard of, nor liked, and took \u2013 no kidding, 4-5 15-minute intermissions in between every 2-3 songs. It wasn't bad enough I didn't really want to be there in the first place, I was barely friends with the boyfriend replacement and I didn't care for their music as a whole, but they stretched it out as long as possible with far too many breaks.And still, I would rather go back to that concert than watch this again.",

            "content": "Let's just be brutally honest here; this is a Spice Girls vehicle. No doubt about it. From the biggest hater of the film to the biggest fan of the girls, everyone might as well admit from the very beginning: this film was primarily (and, in the opinion of many, purely) made to promote the Spice Girls as well as their then-new album. The moment you realize/accept that fact is the moment that this film gets easier to sit through. However, it still is very, very hard to sit through, and the majority of the people I know wouldn't be able to sit through the entirety of this mess of a film, not even to satisfy the most basic human instincts of curiosity by finding out what happens in the end. The film pretty much plays like a 90-minute promotional video, or a compilation of music videos with pointless plot in-between each performance to keep the music from getting to be too much. Newsflash: the people who would willingly watch this would most likely be just as happy with a 90-minute compilation of music videos or live performances; they don't care about the film itself. I'm not saying that every single Spice Girls fan hated, or even disliked the film itself(I'm not even claiming that one single fan didn't enjoy seeing the girls being \"themselves\"); what I am saying is that they wouldn't have cared if this feature was a 90-minute long music video, instead of the barely coherent mess that the movie is. But, back to the point I was trying to make; the film is a Spice Girls movie. Not a comedy, or a music movie, but a Spice Girls movie. Made entirely for the fans. This, of course, means that the movie is exclusively enjoyable for the fans... and now that the girl-band is no longer a hot subject, and it's no longer \"in\" to like them, their fan-base has been reduced to a minimum. Therefore, now, only seven years after the film was made(or a few years ago, for that matter; ever since they stopped being popular) the film will only appeal to those who are still fans. As you have probably figured out by everything I've written up to this point, I am not, nor have I ever been a fan of the girls. They are charming, sure, their songs are catchy(admit it, even you've hummed along one or two of their singles when it came on the radio), and they are, undeniably, quite attractive, but that's all there is to it... and that's certainly not enough to carry a feature film, once they're no longer famous. Of course, the director probably didn't think about that, and merely made the film to capitalize on their popularity. Oh well. The film now belongs in the same category as one of those films made about some famous guy/girl/group of people that people no longer care about... probably all inspired by The Beatles(unless someone came before them... I'm not sure if they were the first bands to do feature films). The thing is, The Beatles not only were popular back when they made their films, some 30-40 years ago; they still are popular. The Spice Girls aren't. They were merely the newest of the popular teen-bands... and they didn't last much longer than most others. Now, that's enough for the analyzing, on to the review. The plot is barely coherent and poorly paced, constantly throwing new characters into the story, that appear for a few minutes only to disappear again, as well as introducing subplots that are never used to full advantage. The acting is atrocious. The characters are tired stereotypes. The cinematography is forgettable and unimaginative. The humor is British humor at its worst(I think, at least; I haven't seen enough British comedies to determine if there is a lower level than this). All in all, the film have little to offer(apart from one or two clever references and some good self-parodying in one or two places) to anyone but Spice Girls fans. I recommend this exclusively to Spice Girls fans. It's to painful to sit through for virtually anyone else, even if it's just to laugh at the pure stupidity of it. Everyone but Spice Girls fans: Avoid at all costs. 1/10",

When I think back, I don't know exactly why I did, but I was only eleven/twelve years old at the time, so I've obviously changed a bit since then. Right now, I'm basically indifferent to the group, so I don't have any strong feelings about their reunion. Anyway, I obviously wouldn't have even thought of watching this movie back in the day, but a decade after it first came out, I have finally watched it, and have learned that I wasn't missing much.The film shows the Spice Girls (Melanie B, Melanie C, Emma, Victoria, and Geri) as they travel around in England on their double-decker bus, meeting lots of people, and sometimes having fun, but also experiencing all sorts of trouble. Meanwhile, a newspaper editor named Kevin McMaxford, who hates the Spice Girls, is spreading rumours about them to try and ruin their reputation, and a film director named Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth keeps coming up with silly movie ideas for the band. The five pop stars have a gig coming up in a few days at the Royal Albert Hall in London, but as it draws near, a lot gets in their way! Some love the Spice Girls and some hate them, but regardless of that, as a film, \"Spice World\" is a very poor effort. The story isn't very well-written, carelessly slopped together, and it seems a lot of things were just thrown in, such as the group meeting extraterrestrial fans. The film often seems rushed, jumping from one scene to another too quickly. The script, which was clearly just slopped together as well, is very poor, with both the band members and other characters blurting out lines which are supposed to be funny, but are just ridiculous! Almost all the gags in the film (yes, this is a comedy) are lame. I never laughed, and none of the gags ever gave me a full smile. Lastly, the ending of the film is a tad abrupt.Now, if I were a big Spice Girls fan, I'm sure that would have helped a bit, as a good number of their songs are featured in this film, whether in full or in part, but I still certainly wouldn't have cared for much else in the film. I think I've made it clear that regardless of the music, this is one unfocused mess of a film! It was probably meant for the group's preteen fans mainly. I remember a lot of them, the majority of them girls, but there were definitely quite a few boys as well, and I'm sure most of these fans liked it. However, the movie really doesn't have a lot for most people, apart from the songs for fans, and sadly, that is not enough to make up for the extremely poor quality of \"Spice World\".",

Meat Loaf and Richard O'Brien are, of course, wasted. Few speaking lines, no musical contributions, really just cameos.For those who like bad movies (i.e. enjoy making fun of them MST3K style), this is still NOT a good movie for you. I think that's because the movie is already supposed to be a comedy. For some reason, it's difficult to crack funny jokes at a bad comedy. Maybe that's why MST3K never used comedies in their show. The bad humor cancels out your good humor, somehow.Anyway, a movie to avoid at all costs. Zero stars.",

            "content": "About half way through Spice World, it dawned on me that it wasn't going to get any better than the level it was maintaining and a nasty thought hit me: \"when people ask me why I actually motivated myself to sit down and watch this all the way through, I am going to have to think of something to say in reply rather than merely shrug and look down at the floor in embarrassment.\" I found myself for the next ten minutes thinking up various excuses I could use as reasons but eventually settled for 'Curiosity'.Yes; when a film is so bad it motivates you to actually think up reasons you're going to have to say to people when they ask you why you watched it, it's struggling. As it was with Thunderbirds, I was curious as to know what the hell it was all about. I was old enough to remember the Spice Girls and old enough to dislike them but distinctly recall this film getting released. Following the break up and now apparent reunification, Spice World as a film doesn't even hold together as a piece of nostalgic nonsense that should be good enough to kill a few hours as we watch global female icons strut around in little costumes and sing silly little songs. Spice World does not even give us the luxury of having a plot; instead it is more of a documentary-come-spoof of not only the band in question but certain generic films of yesteryear. This means it plays out more like Epic Movie than anything else.Spice World is really just one massive contradiction. It contradicts itself, its characters contradict what they want to be and how they want to be seen as and even the immediate ending contradicts whether or not it is a film within a film. At the time of the Spice Girls, there was very much an atmosphere of the band wanting to take over. The title of this film: 'Spice World' suggests a world full of 'spice'; the video for the song of the same name is set in a dystopian future where everything is exactly that; the 'V' sign the girls use to signify girl power is commonly associated with 'victory', ie; Victory, girl power rules'; there is also the familiar sight of a band cashing in on consumerism and globalisation as they make their presence more known around the world. But rather than Spice World posing as some sort of political/musical version of Battleship Potemkin; its scenes play out more like a retread of films that we've already seen. Roger Moore was James Bond and he spoofs the Bond villain persona; Richard E. Grant sits and listens to film pitches al\u00e1 The Player and the final incident involving a bomb blowing up not only means the film is confused as to whether its fiction or not but whether or not it thinks the fourth wall is reparable once it has been broken.The worst example of contradictory content in the film comes very early on when the girls are sitting in a bus, that looks more like an actual room than anything else, discussing how they hate being seen as the 'baby'; the 'posh one' the 'scary one', etc. Fine you think, maybe they are getting sick of that but what follows is an immediate counteraction to their complaint in the form of a montage showing each of the girls dressed as Wonder Woman, Marilyn Monroe and then of each other. The girls go from wearing their clothes, acting dumb and stating that \"there's more to us than just our persona tags\" to..........wearing even more clothes and costumes and acting in an even dumber manner. You can imagine the thought process: so Ginger Spice doesn't like to be called Ginger Spice anymore; \"Ok, I know; I'll dress up like Wonder Woman and crack a whip.\" Yes, I can see there's so much more to you than your generic tags. The other glaring example of contradiction in this film that the girls fall foul of comes in the form of their allegiances. Nearer the beginning of the film rather than the middle, the girls talk about how important their fans are to them; this idea returns to haunt them since the actual final third revolves around a dilemma the girls face: stay with a friend as they give birth and shun fans waiting at the gig or vice-versa. There should be no argument: they've established their fans come first but what happens is they counter balance their priorities by staying in the hospital with their pregnant friend.Spice World is a film that does absolutely no favours for anyone and that includes the girls themselves. The Spice Girls come across as plastic, one-dimensional and rather stupid; frequently getting their priorities, beliefs and ideas mixed up with one another; never giving us the impression these are smart and good people making smart and good music. The film's portrayal of Italians and homosexuals is disappointing as is the incompetent film crew consisting of a black man and a fat person; the way the bad guy is a fat, spitting Australian bent on magazine sales who has an English assistant is horrible; the film's narrative wants us to believe that stuff being printed in the newspapers by a man who gets the scoops in an impossible manner is entertaining and realistic but it's just silly. There just isn't enough space to cover all the things horribly wrong with this film but I am surprised this didn't destroy the Spice Girls when it first came out. Cheap laughs; a nasty narrative; horrible archetypes and so many times in which the focus band of the title come across as incompetent is enough to label this trash, 'trash'.",

Spice World is, and is meant to be, purely the fan-fantasy featuring five of their favorite singers doing... well, whatever. The film goes around with several subplots, one more forgettable than the other. But throughout we do see Spice Girls interacting (and overacting). When you are a child fan, that is how you imagine they must spend some of their free time, or at least, you fantasize about it in a similar fashion. Their personalities in the film are actually only exaggerated versions on what stereotype their nicknames presented them with. If you are not a Spice Girls fan, do not see this film. You will probably not enjoy. Unless you are looking something 'so bad it's good'. Film goes nowhere and gives you nothing, unless you are a fan and enjoy seeing them on big screen, mostly singing familiar songs, bickering and having fun. It is definitely a plus if you are in a super-funny mode and ready to have some laugh with them and at them. My diagnostics: 8/10 for fans, 3/10 for everyone else.",

            "content": "I was stunned to find the panning this film got. Okay, it's not high art, but it's a good laugh, surely?One thing removed from this film in just two years is the veneer of satire. Released in England at a time when the media had begun a predictable backlash and the Spice Girls were about to jettison their manager, this tale of dictating management and not-that-subtle Robert Maxwell spoofs was vaguely on the money. Now that such things are behind the group, and they are indeed back in media favour (for marriages and babies more than the music, and without Geri) this edge is stripped from the film.So, what are we left with? Well, the girls aren't about to threaten the Academy Awards, though \"Baby Spice\", who had acted professionally before the group, is noticeably stronger than the rest. Characterisation is strictly one-dimensional, with the constant \"Gucci dress\" fixations of Victoria and crowbarred-in football associations of \"Sporty\" the most irritating element. Suprisingly, the loudest member, Mel G, has the least material foisted on her, and takes the minor role in all the amateurish vignettes. Baby is allowed to smile cutely, and Geri is the brunt of a cavalcade of bra jokes. But this isn't so bad, surely? To spend 90 minutes in the company of five pretty girls, well, four pretty girls, three, well, two, surely, isn't so hard.Unfortunately, the lack of on-screen presence the girls generate means that they have to be supported by a wide variety of actors, and even other pop stars that achieve a greater presence in momentary cameos (look out for the great scene with Elvis Costello, forced to work as a barman now times are hard). George Wendt, Richard O'Brien, Barry Humphries and even Meatloaf add an air of interest to proceedings, meaning that when the camera switches back to the stars it does tend to sag.When the girls do start to get interesting is when they're performing their songs. Though as most of their songs are remixed or rejigged snippets, this would surely fail to attract the teeny-tot audience at which the film is primarily aimed. As I've said, there are moments of attempted satire, though these are less well-aimed barbs than poorly-aimed damp squibs.Yet still I contend: songs, girls, Roger Moore sending himself up rotten and Richard E.Grant overacting enormously. Not a classic, certainly, but surely good for a throwaway laugh?",

By the end of the movie, the wannabes had thrown all their drink ice at the movie screen and were booing it out loud.  This is one reason not to watch this movie, even on video at home.  There is a chance the ice you throw at the tv screen may somehow harm it, and your booing will wake the neighbors.The teeny-boppers were not impressed with everyone else's responses to the film (violent vomiting, painful spasms), but I'm sure they've seen it another 40 times on video, alternating it with viewings of Titanic.In short, this is a bad movie.  A very, very, very bad movie.

OK, three out of four ain't bad.) To appreciate the movie, one must see the movie for what it is, a satire! The movie was described as a \"mockumentary\" because it basically made fun of everything within reach and some things that were out of reach, like the extraterrestrials who traveled across the galaxies to get autographs from the Spice Girls! C'mon, lighten up! This movie was never meant to inspire or stimulate the intellect. It was made strictly for laughs. The Spice Girls even made fun of themselves. Anything is fair game! The first time I saw \"Spice World\" was in 1998 when I took my daughter, then 10, to the movies. Although she enjoyed it (she was big on the Spice Girls at that time), for me it was sheer torture and an insult to my intelligence. I wanted to cover my face and hope that nobody saw me. I felt that the movie was an excellent example of intellectual manslaughter! If this wasn't bad enough, when the movie was released on video, my daughter wanted the video as well. So we got to see the movie in the privacy of our home. Oh boy! But seeing the movie in the spirit that it was made in, was a totally different experience. It was actually entertaining in a corny way! It definitely qualifies as a candidate for the Golden Turkey Award because it is so bad that it's good! The great and talented Sir Roger Moore obviously read the script before he agreed to contribute his talents to this movie. So it is obviously that he saw the movie for what it was meant to be, a satire, or as they put it it, a mockumentary.The movie was loosely based on the Beatles' HARD DAY'S NIGHT. (OK, before you Beatles fans go into a frenzy over that remark, let me explain and redeem myself!) The movie is about a wildly popular group as they tour the country. In 1964, the Beatles traveled by train. In 1997, the Spice Girls traveled by their ridiculously luxurious bus. The scene around the bus should serve as a tip off that this movie is not meant to be taken seriously! Both movies involved a villain who hated the main attraction of the movie.So unless you are an \"old teenager\" with fond memories of the \"good old days\" (the 1990s), you may want to lock the door, put on a set of head phones (or turn the volume down low so nobody can hear what you are trying to watch) before putting this movie on.Then, just lighten up and try not to take everything so damned seriously. You may actually find yourself enjoying this awful movie!",

I'm way too old to be a Spice Girls fan; my husband and I saw this on cable, and my main reason for scanning it was to see Roger Moore.Let's get the obligatory bashing out of the way:  the Spice Girls can't act very well, they sing a little better, they've got a good media machine hyping them, a good arranger for their tunes, and I liked the \"2 Become 1\" video on MTV.The script for this movie, however flawed, was a little gem.  And in regard to all the other posters decrying Roger Moore's involvement in the movie, I recommend that you catch the flick on cable or rent the tape and watch Mr. Moore's scenes again, carefully.  He's always in Chief's minimalist office/sitting room, there's no one there but the animals (and behind the cameraman are the lighting guys and the animal wrangler), and Mr. Moore works wonders with jaw-breakingly nonsensical dialogue.  Not only all that, but he ended up with probably the most sophisticated and opulent wardrobe of anyone in the movie!Oh, and for those folks who think Mr. Moore may have been desperate for money to do this movie--Do you remember that little programme on the telly back in the 60s?  \"The Saint\"?  Five series (seasons) in black and white and two series in colour?  Mr. Moore was co-producer of the two color seasons and gets his bit whenever a videotape is sold or the package is aired, which is quite often on both counts.  It's kinda like having an American 401(k) retirement plan, but with better music and clothes.Love & Lasers! GalaxyGal",

The whole thing reminded me a bit of The Beatles' movies, I guess it's just a modern day spoof. The movie is just one joke and anyone who takes it seriously need their heads checked out! One of the funniest bits in the movie is (quite near the end) the journey from the hospital to the Albert Hall. The bit with the bus 'flying through the air' was hilarious. Another good bit was 'Bob, we've got to sort out your hair' and poor old Bob Geldof ended up a ridiculous hair style... v. funny!",

Their manager Clifford and his behind the scenes boss want to control the girls' lives with the sole goal of getting them to the concert in the best shape possible. A documentary crew wants access during the girls' busy schedule. A Hollywood pitch team wants them to star in a movie. The London tabloids want to print whatever they can get their hands on, even if it ruins the girls' careers. Through it all, the girls evaluate their lives and wonder if they've lost sight of what is really important in life.........The ironic thing about this film is that the things that are shown as a 'danger' to them in the film, are the exact same thing that gave these five stars the career and the money they have today.And it's the same people who thought it would be a good idea to release a Spice Girls film, to milk every last penny they could from the girls. And it's a good job they released it when they did, because they had just reached their peak.So the film is nothing more than an excuse for them to sing their hits, and inbetween have some fun little cameos for the older members of the audience. And it's just all over the place.Obviously the group can't act, but they have screen presence, and the story is paper thin, throwing everything in the mix to try and avoid people from spotting the incoherence of the plot.It is rubbish, just like the processed pap that the group released over their two years at the top of their 'game', and paved the way for the loud mouthed teenagers we have strutting the streets being totally abhorrent toward one another and their peers.That's Girl Power.An utterly vile piece of filth that should never be seen by anyone.",

If you see 'Spice World' starring the Spice Girls in your local Hollybuster video store and you've never really liked the Spice Girls, you probably won't like this movie.  That's not too difficult to figure out, or so I thought until I read some of the reviews here.  Did they think that Baby Spice would win an Oscar for her performance?  Did they think that a movie 'based' on the Girls' lives would be thought-provoking?  Maybe they just thought that this would be the first PG-rated movie with full nudity.  I can't figure it out.I personally like the Spice Girls.  They seem like they are a lot of fun, and their music is upbeat.  To be honest, I think that they brought us out of the drudge of Grunge and Hard-core rap that we were experiencing in the mid-90's.  They brought the happiness back to music.On the other hand, I blame them fully for the popularity of all these teeny-bopper singers that have invaded my radio, but that's not my point.'Spice World' is just a fun little movie that is a guilty pleasure for me and many other people.

A classic case of a good comedy being put together by having a good team behind them. Lots of fun poked at themselves, which is what makes it, I think, very funny indeed - the girls aren't afraid to completely take the p**s out of themselves. (or they weren't afraid, in those days - the progression of Victoria \"Posh\" Beckham into pop culture paranoia makes you wonder if they'd do it as well now) All up, take it for what it is - a cheesy flick about a pop band phenomenon.

Definitely not to be taken seriously (some people act like they were expecting Shakespeare here), it's a funny, charming, witty and light hearted romp through a week or so in the life of the Spice Girls. Of course, the girls play stereotyped versions of themselves - Mel C is always exercising, while Baby is constantly sucking lollipops and Posh obsesses over which black Gucci dress to wear. The girls aren't bad actors; they seem quite natural, which is probably not as easy as it sounds when making a film. The plot is quite simple, but the twists and turns it takes (eg the screen writers explaining their premise to Richard E Grant becomes a narrative of the girls actually doing the crazy things that so far have only been committed to paper) make it a wild ride. My favorite part of the film is the incredible special effect of the double decker Spice bus leaping over an open drawbridge. The build up to this scene was perfectly tense, and the climax of the scene was brilliantly conceived and executed. I've seen this film many times over the last few years.

I think the movie does a good job of depicting a week in the life of the SG but too much of the film is spent with utter silliness and stupidity with their \"Girl Power\" stuff. Lots of cameo appearances here as well, with the one surprise being former \"Kids In The Hall\" alum Mark McKinney.There is one scene that is total BS though: There is a flashback scene in the middle where the SG are nobodies and they're at a greasy spoon with their Oriental friend and they say they have a song and a dance routine that they hope will give them fame. Oh, I guess that means that you weren't put together by a producer and given dance lessons and song lyrics from others. You were always buddy-buddy and aren't like all the other put together for a buck pop groups. What total crap! Why would they even try to sell that fact anyway?

I think the plot was good although parts i didn't get such as the guy who wants to make a movie of the spice girls and the creepy photographer. Overall the film gives off a feel good image and a let your hair down one. The spice girls different personalities make it good viewing too. I think at times the movie tried to be too serious forgetting the fact that some of the story lines were a bit too silly and that the spice girls aren't professional actors. However the funnier and less strained scenes were brilliant such as the bits at the old house and the photo-shoot. Now being nearly 18 i am well out of the movies original target audience, although i was when it was released! So now being older i can pick up on things that are not good but that doesn't take away my initial love of the movie.

They were the biggest craze I personally have ever witnessed. After making two hit albums, they decided to have a go at acting, and made a film finally released in December '97 (I believe). I was too embarrassed to queue up to see it at the cinema.In mid-'98, SpiceWorld was released on video in a range of special edition tins with all five members on. Quite ironic really, considering Geri had left the band in March. The woman at the counter couldn't help but chuckle as I'm at the counter with \u00a315 purchasing this. Something tells me I should have worn a mask to hide my identity.After seeing the film, I haven't seen it again. It sits on the shelf gathering dust. I'm giving it away at a car boot sale next week. It's an absolutely poor film. The Spice Girls are about as useful as actresses as a pea-shooter in a gun battle. The plot is absolutely hideous. Not that I can be bothered to remember any of it. Richard E Grant stars as The Spice Girls manager, who tries to stop some villains trying to make them look like retired amateur porn stars. Could have fooled me, they already do. The gags are so useless and make the five stars of this movie look total idiots. What's so frightening is, the gags are scripted! They actually rehearsed the jokes! Ohmigod!!!!The media slammed this film and made The Spice Girls look like utter laughing stocks. No wonder you wouldn't recognise the remaining four tarts today. 1/5",

            "content": "I have been a huge fan of the Spice Girls since I was nine years old, I have listened to their songs thousands of times, and I was lucky enough to see them live at Wembley Stadium when they reunited (without Victoria) in 2019, so obviously I saw this movie at the cinema when I was a kid. Basically the Spice Girls: Melanie \"Mel B\" Brown aka Scary Spice, Emma Bunton aka Baby Spice, Melanie \"Mel C\" Chisholm aka Sporty Spice, Geri Halliwell (now Horner) aka Ginger Spice, and Victoria Beckham (then Adams) aka Posh Spice (all deservedly winners of the Razzie for Worst Actress, they were also nominated Worst New Star) are the biggest girl band in the UK and across the world. They have performed their latest single, \"Too Much\" (wrongly nominated the Razzie for Worst Original Song), but they have become tired of the burdens of fame and fortune. The girls' uptight tour manager, Clifford (Richard E. Grant), is becoming frequently annoyed by their lack of commitment to their scheduled appointments, and he is often pressured with calls from the head of the girls' record label, the cryptic and eccentric \"Chief\" (Razzie nominated Sir Roger Moore). Meanwhile, sinister newspaper owner Kevin McMaxford (Barry Humphries) wants to ruin the Spice Girls' reputation to sell more copies, so he dispatches photographer Damien (Richard O'Brien) to capture and record the girls' every move. Also stalking the girls is less threatening but more annoying documentary maker Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth (Alan Cumming), hoping to use them as subjects for his next project. Clifford, and his sympathetic assistant Deborah (Claire Rushbrook), are also trying to fend off over-eager Hollywood writers, Martin Barnfield (George Wendt) and Graydon (Mark McKinney), who relentlessly pitch absurd plot ideas for a feature film for the Spice Girls. The Spice Girls are preparing for a performance at the Royal Albert Hall, and meanwhile stick to a schedule of practising songs and routines, travelling in the Union Jack painted Spice Bus, and making public appearances. This means less time to themselves, including spending time with their pregnant best friend, Nicola (Naoko Mori), who is due to give birth soon. The stress and overwork culminate in a huge argument between Clifford and the girls, they storm out on the evening before their gig at the Albert Hall. The girls think back on their humble beginnings and their struggle to the top, they reunite outside the now-abandoned caf\u00e9 where they practiced during their childhood years, they reconcile, and decide to take Nicola out dancing. However, Nicola goes into labour at the nightclub and is rushed to the hospital, giving birth to a healthy baby girl. The Spice Girls have a run in with Damien, disguised as a delivery doctor, but after hitting his head, he realises the error of his ways, and goes after McMaxford, who is fired in a \"Jacuzzi scandal\". The girls' bus driver Dennis (Meat Loaf) goes missing, so Victoria drives the bus, and it is race against time to reach the Royal Albert Hall in time. There are many obstacles on the way, including a jump across Tower Bridge over the open gap, and Emma discovering a bomb underneath the bus. The Spice Girls make it for their performance, with thousands of fans in the audience, and watching live on television, as they open with \"Spice Up Your Life\". As the credits roll, the Spice Girls are talking to members of the film crew, until Mel C breaks the fourth wall, the girls talk to us (the audience), and discuss their film, just minutes before the bomb explodes on the bus. Also starring Jason Flemyng as Brad, Steven O'Donnell as Jess, Michael Barrymore as Mr. Step, Richard Briers as Bishop, Jennifer Saunders as Fashionable Woman, Hugh Laurie as Poirot, Stephen Fry as Judge, Peter Sissons, Sir Elton John, Jonathan Ross, Jools Holland as Musical Director, Neil Mullarkey as Barnaby, Dominic West as Photographer, Bill Paterson as Brian, Elvis Costello as Bartender, Bob Geldof, Bob Hoskins and Kevin McNally as Policeman. Despite their lack of acting skills, Mel B, Geri, Emma, Mel C, and Victoria are likeable, and do their best to spoof their nickname personalities, obviously they make up for it with their catchy songs, it is also fun to spot recognisable cameo guest stars. Featuring the songs \"Wannabe\", \"Stop\", \"Spice Up Your Life\", \"Too Much\", \"Saturday Night Divas\", \"Never Give Up On The Good Times\", \"Do It\", \"Say You'll Be There\", \"2 Become 1\", \"Mama\", \"Who Do You Think You Are\" and \"Viva Forever\". This film was made for two reasons, to cash in on the worldwide success of the Spice Girls brand, and an attempt to capture the same vibe that The Beatles, and Sir Cliff Richard brought in their films, it did do well at the box office, but critics and fans were less than impressed, you can maybe laugh at how silly it is, apart from the songs, a disappointing musical comedy. It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Picture, Worst Screen Couple for any combination of two characters, body parts or fashion accessories, Worst Screenplay, and Worst 'Musical' of Our First 25 Years. The Spice Girls were number 32 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Adequate!",

Baby Spice - stop sucking those lollipops, it's not cute, it's retarded. Sporty Spice - her voice is like a constant drilling in my ears. Ginger Spice - I'm so glad she left the group. Posh Spice - my goldfish has a better personality. Scary Spice - well, she was the best of a bad bunch.Richard E.Grant seems to be as embarassed as I was while starring in the film. The cameos from famous faces are only successful when they don't have to be on the screen with the Spicegirls. Roger Moore is quite funny and Bob Hoskins doesn't shame himself.  I don't know what genre you'd put this in. It can't be classified as a comedy because it's not funny. It can't be classified as a musical because these girls can't sing.

            "content": "Movies come in three basic categories: flick, movie, and film. What Spice World amazingly does is break the barrier to create a whole new category that cannot be describe in any words for it's so profound beyond any comprehension. The pure excellence of this movie has forced me to never compare any other movie to this one; it's quite difficult to compare any movie that I have seen and will see to a movie that's more than a standard deviation above a film.I firmly believe that Spice World is the best movie made and is a universal symbol for what the cinema should be. Always. It is crafted with such delicate perfection that it's tantamount, if not paramount to, a Hearts on Fire Diamond.Now, the message of this is a vital message that our society has never received before: Girl Power. This is not a simple movie about feminism or oppression of women, or how to break barriers that are implanted by the almighty Man. It's about none of that. We see five young ladies struggle with the identities that society has knighted them with. As most hardcore Spice Girls fans know is that they did not chose to be deemed \"Ginger Spice\" \"Posh Spice\" and so on and so forth. Those alter egos were in fact forced upon them with a printing of a magazine. We see these ladies not as the \"Spice Girls\" but rather as women who are broken and are in a constant struggle with their true identity meanwhile the struggle of their job being that facade of flamboyancy that is just so them.\"I think we're just getting comfortable with who we are\" is the beautifulest line in the movie and is response to Melanie C stating \"Why do people stereotype us all the time?\" I teared up when I heard that. This film took the universal concept of identity that everyone struggles with at some point in their life, and they made this wonderful piece of art.Aside from its profound meaning, it's a genuinely fun movie to watch. Ever since I saw Spice World, I am strong with my stance that every single movie should feature Meatloaf as a character making weak references to his gloriously powerful songs such as \"I'd do anything for love, but I won't do that\". With a pinch of pop culture references, the cinematic experience the viewer goes through is tantamount to an euphoria.Thanks to Spice World, I have learned the true meaning behind Geri's words of \"Girl Power\". This film is definitely one of the movies that everyone must see at least twice. The only criticism I have is the unrealistic transition between outside bus to inside the Spice Bus. However, such minute details can be overlooked.",

There are many many memorable moments from this film that every time it comes up in conversation people will always quote. One being the 'bus going over the bridge' scene and instead of having the stunt proceed a clay model is used.The script is very funny and will get a laugh from even the most skeptical.

As far as the film, again think of A Hard Days Night. Completely plot less, just a vehicle to hear the music and see the larger than life performers on the big screen. Ahh, but it was a slick well made film wasn't it and the charisma of the stars did in fact carry it over the goal line. So it can also be said, constant reader, of Spice World.

Enough so that we occasionally trek to Los Angeles just to be closer to the aura of the entertainment world.  I was in London when the Spice Girls went to the top of the charts there, so I witnessed their phenomenon twice.That in mind- I must say that \"Spice World\" has got to be, hands down, the worst movie that I have ever seen.  The acting is just outright uninspired and lousy.  The plot line... well.. let's just say you won't have to think much during this movie.It is so bad that we both have recommended it to friends on the premise that you'll never see another movie as bad as it. :)  Personally I nominate the birth scene for worst acted scene in the history of the entertainment world.Looking for similar pictures?  Check out \"Cool as Ice\", Vanilla Ice's movie of the same genre.  It's actually a little better than this one.",

Most movies made feature a credit that will read something to the effect of \"story by...\" but not this one. No, that credit is actually replaced by one that reads \"idea by...\" and that pretty much tells you everything you need to know. Really? The biggest pop female pop band that the world has ever seen and one that apparently made between $600-$800 million can only come up with a movie based on an idea? I guess it really doesn't matter that SPICE WORLD has been called one of the worst movies ever made because their fans ate it up when it was released and apparently they are still very fond of it. I guess if I was a die-hard fan of the group then I'd enjoy seeing them in anything no matter how bad it actually was. What makes this film so bad is that there really doesn't seem to be any idea of what this movie is supposed to be about. I'm sure it was an attempt to milk the success of the band and that's understandable. I just wish we had actually gotten a backstage look at the lives they were going through or at least gave us some sort of realistic look at the band. Instead we basically just get one long music video where the girls play their music and get to try on many different outfits. Nothing the five girls say are funny. Nothing they say is very interesting. In fact, nothing they do is all that entertaining. The movie actually reaches a level where it becomes painful to sit through it any longer. Heck, the girls can even lip-sync their songs and that well. SPICE WORLD doesn't quite earn a BOMB ranking thanks in large part to the girls being cute and wearing tight clothes but you can look at a magazine for this. The film itself is quite bad and sadly it never reaches a level to where you can just laugh at it.",

In an era where films seem to be manufactured on a conveyor belt, Spice World is truly one of a kind. A film that places the Spice Girls within a fictional narrative involving aliens and delivering babies is surely unique. Love it or hate it, but at least admit that it is different.Personally, I think the movie is hilarious. I didn't really expect any of the Spice Girls to be great actresses but watching them struggle to even convincingly play themselves is amusing. The plot is suitably ridiculous and the musical segments are agreeable enough. Spice World may be crap, but it is always entertaining.If watching Posh Spice fall into a river is not your idea of great cinema, then I pity you.

Granted, there are a few inventive situations scattered throughout for off-stage interplay, but the whole thing could have been much better if all the men and their subplots just disappeared and the girls were just allowed to sing and play.Previously unavailable on DVD except in pan and scan mode (at least every place I've ever shopped), this film has finally been re-released on DVD in its original wide screen format on the eve of a tenth year reunion tour.

Scary Spice inspired me to love my huge curly hair. Sporty Spice inspired me to embrace my inner tom-boy. Their songs were catchy and widely popular for a while. Their movie venture may not have been as successful as their songs. However, it was not a total flop. Spice World had a wacky but interesting story line and a few compelling sub-story lines.

The Spice Girls don't sing very well and in this movie they don't sing very much. But if there singing is bland, their acting . . . well they don't really act they just kind of spout bad puns and giggles a lot. I saw them on a talk show just before I saw this movie and I swear it took me almost the entire hour to figure out which one was which.Apparently an homage to 'A Hard Day's Night', 'Spice World' shows us a day in the life of The Spice Girls, a flash-in-the-pan British singing group that have no discernible talent. Their merchandise line includes albums, dolls, T-shirts, coloring books, mousepads, posters, stickers, mugs, bookbags, lunchboxes and on top of the pile 'Spice World'. It is as useless as those items and can be passed over just as quickly.They are cheerful, positive, wear each other's clothes, sleep in the same bus, urinate together and have the moniker 'Girl Power' without ever stopping (at least in this movie) to tell us what that means exactly. They don't have time because the movie is more interested in dumb skits, idiotic sight gags, wasted supporting players (Richard E. Grant, Bob Hoskins, Roger Moore) and their pregnant friend who goes into labor for reason I have yet to figure out.'A Hard Day's Night' worked because the Beatles were so much fun to watch together. George, Paul, John and Ringo had individual personalities and when we weren't watching them having fun together we got to hear some of the greatest rock and roll songs ever written. The Spice Girls are so lacking in personality that I swear after 30 minutes, the screenplay desperately tries to find something for them to do.I didn't know much about The Spice Girls before this movie, and when it was over I still had not idea why they were so popular. I just recently learned that Geri Halliwell dropped out of the group and became the U.N. Goodwill Ambassador. She apparently decided that there was only so much that one could do with platform boots and a plunging neckline. Now that's girl power.",

I won't say that is a pretty lousy timekiller. It just isn't worth the appeal, even with five singing Barbie dolls who can dress. The movie is a lot of kidding around, but it actually has its heart in the right place in satirizing movie references and showing off its \"Girl Power\". There!

As you easily know, this movie was put out within a year following the Spice Girls' rapid rise to fame and fortune, and so you have here a rush job in the making. It all goes to show why promoting big name franchises pays off in these high-tech days, without a whole lot of \"movie\" to back it up (Are you paying attention, Sony?).Sooner or later, you're gonna find SPICE WORLD sitting right next to those New Kids On The Block tapes in the thrift stores, and even the GARBAGE PAIL KIDS MOVIE on the dusty shelves of hidden stockrooms.

It doesn't really matter.Much like a Rambo film, Avengers films, or a Spiderman film, you know what's about to happen; full of ass whooping and awesome.Starring the Spice Girls ( all of them) doing what they do best -Spice up our lives, you would be a fool to miss this one-of-a kind film that the entire human civilization looks back upon in instant nostalgia and wonder.Here's an example straight out of the film :Posh: You could always take your shirt off, Geri. Ginger Spice: Shut up. Posh: It was just a joke.It keeps you in suspense. \"Will she take her shirt off?\" you wonder. Inside you, you beg she does. She instantaneously feel the need of religion, and accept Jesus into your life. If Jesus doesn't persuade her to take off her shirt, who will? Well no one, because she doesn't take her shirt off.But the thought of it was still amazing.A must watch. If you have a weak heart, consider yourself warned.",

For the ones who think this movie is rubbish , i would recommended them to watch it again. Come on all Spice Girls fans let's try to remove the Spice World movie from the bottom 100 , we can do it. I think the girls should love the Spice Girls because they're Feminist , and that's a really good and important thing. My favorite is Emma Bunton , i think she's so sexy and in the other hand she's so sweet. I also really like Geri Halliwell , i like her personality and i think she have had a hard life , she deserves to have a good life. I hope the Spice Girls come back together for a 10th year reunion.Does anybodye knows how can i contact the Spice Girls??? If anybody knows please contact me at gio_9391@hotmail.com Thanks Giovannixxx",

Before you see this movie, take this short and simple survey: 1. Are you a female or particularly flamboyant male? 2. Were you born in the time period of 1986-1991?If you've answered \"No,\" to any of the above questions, avoid this movie at all costs. You will be revolted and maybe a little disturbed. But hey, if you answered \"Yes\" to those questions, chances are you've already seen the Spice Girls more than once. You remember that they were a huge hit, that Spice Girls paraphernalia drowned girlish child and tweenie stores, and that you and your best friends would pretend you were the Spice Girls during recess and argue about who got to be Baby Spice. If you answered \"Yes,\" chances are Spice Girls still retains that touch of magic it always has. What is the \"touch\"? Who can be sure. Perhaps it's the fact those Spice Girls kicked butt, that their clothes were cool, that they came out on top, those neat accents (if you didn't grow up in the UK), their awesome clothes, and those completely addictive songs that were the most fun to sing during slumber parties. It is what it is. That being said, for all you \"No,\" people, the Spice Girls is not going to have the same memories or magic touch for you. Though I can't directly relate, I can imagine it being an obnoxious, shallow, unstable, and undeniably annoying movie destined for kindergarten girls. Because Spice Girls will always be THE Spice Girls to me, I'm giving it a 7.",

Little did I realize back then how bad the acting was, how it now seems like a low budget movie, and how it was poorly directed. However, at seven years of age what did I care? They were my superstars that I hung posters up on my room. They were the girls I looked for inspiration, this ladies who were my idols at the tender age of seven. While watching this movie I got excited and loved singing to the songs with all my best friends. So what if it isn't a award winning performance? I will find this \"ancient\" movie in my attic one day thinking back to the 90s, and I will blow the dust off of the paper cover protecting the video cassette. What good memories it brings back. If you were young at the time and loved the Spice Girls, then by all means watch it for those memories. If you were never a fan or never knew about them, don't watch it. I guess it's just a movie for us who have been fans screaming on the couch when we were in grade one.",

He's sitting there explaining the Plot.  They get to a scene when oh my god they're running late for a concert so they hop in their bus and rush along to make it to the show.  Of course on their way a draw bridge is going up and they do the same old \"Speed\" scene.  The producer they are selling this Idea to says sounds expensive and George Wendt quickly replies \"Doesn't have to be\" and they cut to a picture of a little matchbox replica of the Spice Girls Bus going over a model Drawbridge.  Just Hilarious!!  But the rest of the movie was horrid jokes were much worse and it was so bad that any other scenes were just a waste of time to even remember.

The film is nothing more than a series of filmed songs with a few supposedly comedic sketches linking the material. The Spice Girls share 'witty' banter and drive around London in their tour bus while various nefarious managers and media employees work against each other in a plot which has nothing to do with the main characters. The script is dumber than dumb and the Girls are no actresses, with their one-liner delivery quite embarrassing. Poor old Richard E. Grant chews up the scenery while Alan Cumming delivers the fakest accent ever. The rest seems to be an excuse for endless celebrity cameos, which at least takes your mind off the tedium a little.",

            "content": "Anyone who grew up during a certain timeframe can't have not come across the Spice Girls to some degree in the late 90s. Actively listening to their music, or watching their movie, well, that's another matter. Even if one enjoys a genre generally, movies emphasizing music are a separate issue, elevating ham-handedness to another level that one must specifically prepare themselves for. Then there are the broader questions of whether those known for their music can also act, of whether the comedy will land, of the quality of the story - and how much English flavor will be lent to a feature about an English musical group that has international appeal. Suffice to say that there were already a lot of factors hanging over this film before it even entered production. Let's not beat around the bush: this is possibly worth watching as a matter of curiosity, or for those who are huge fans of someone involved. Yet if you're looking for earnest entertainment value in any capacity, 'Spice World' is almost certainly not the picture for you.I genuinely appreciate the work of the hair and makeup artists, and the costume designer. The production design and art direction are swell. The filming locations are splendid, and it's a small joy to see what roles were whipped up to provide cheeky cameos for a wide array of actors, musicians, and otherwise celebrities. (Having the most fun themselves, and likewise probably bringing the most to the movie, are Richard O'Brien and Roger Moore, among others.) Even speaking as someone who never paid particular attention to the Spice Girls when they were the talk of the town, I'd be lying if I said I didn't like (at least some of) the music, and the dance choreography. Furthermore, to the credit of writer Kim Fuller above all, I can honestly say there's some real humor here. There's some fine wit in the dialogue and scene writing, even at its most ridiculous, and some facets of parody and referential comedy, too. Some of the exaggerated characterizations are entertaining in and of themselves; more infrequently, some sight gags or physical comedy come off pretty well, too. Whatever else is true of this picture, I had a good time watching in at least some measure.That's the good news. There's also a lot of bad news, however, foremost of which is that the plot is astoundingly thin - yes, there is an actual plot on hand. But it's effectively the very literal least that could possibly be penned to provide an excuse for stringing together the various scenes and ideas, and it's managed so weakly that one could be forgiven for supposing that it was the last thing Fuller put in his screenplay. Furthermore, far removed from the cleverness that 'Spice World' can claim at one time or another, too much of the would-be comedy boils down to \"Haha! Isn't this so silly?!\" I know conventional wisdom says that puns are the lowest form of comedy, but the folks who hold to that ethos have clearly never watched a picture that wanted them to laugh just for the mere fact that someone or something is behaving in an abnormal manner. I thought Seth MacFarlane went low with the common tactic of 'Family Guy' of wanting us to get our chuckles from \"Look! A thing you recognize! Isn't this great?!\"; sadly, the approach here is worse. And that dovetails into one more crucial criticism, which is that too much of the amusement this film would seek to provide is pretty much a precursor to MacFarlane after all: the mere presence of the Spice Girls, partaking in whatever the script and director Bob Spiers are requiring of them, is supposed to be Enough. Well, sorry to disappoint, friends, but except for the most diehard Spice fans at the absolute zenith of their popularity, that tack is nowhere near enough.I don't think this is so bad as to deserve the full ire it has gotten in the past twenty-five years. Despite what the Stinkers Awards have to say, I don't think this is anywhere close to deserving to be counted among the \"100 worst movies of the twentieth century\"; I've seen too many other features that were far worse. It's worth repeating that I did get some honest laughs out of this; there's some real fun to be had. 'Spice world' does have some measurable intelligence behind its craft. It's just regrettable that there's not more, for too many of these ninety minutes rely on the cheapest of all possible gags, and apply the least of all effort to entertain. With a bit more care, this could have been more meaningfully enjoyable; instead, it's noteworthy and memorable for all the wrong reasons. Indeed, again: unless you're one of those Spice Girls diehards, I don't know how much need there is to see this, save for the direly curious. Yes, you could do much worse, but at the same time, with so many other flicks you could be watching, why spend time with this one?",

I undoubtedly enjoyed their music growing up, entirely truthfully... they did some bangers, don't @ me.As for the film, which I probably haven't seen in 15+ years, I'll put it this way: Spice Girls as musicians: yes! Spice Girls as actresses: not quite. It's extremely cheesy and the acting is very subpar, but the likeability of Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton & Co. at least keeps it watchable; to me, anyway.Richard E. Grant commits to his role, while they also got James Bond himself, Roger Moore, involved. There are also a number of cameos. Their music is entwined well, I wouldn't class myself as a fan but I rate a fair amount of their songs.I can understand if you dislike this, I truly can, but I found it alright to be honest.

Apart from the catchy music and the generally enjoyable overacting \u2013 the all star cast makes it a genuine 'spot the actor' vehicle. (For example: this from http://filmbabble. blogspot.com/2007/06/20 -great-modern-movie-cameos.html : \"Elvis Costello as a bartender and credited as 'Himself' Costello plays a nice tongue-in-cheek note as the Girls talk about their possible flash-in-the-pan prospects\".) It spoofs everything about those bad movies we loved to watch \u2013 model buses jumping over model bridges, E.T. (the Movie) in 'bad green coats', the Magical Mystery Tour amazing bus, media moguls (Rupert Murdoch anyone?), Hollywood 'run and go' action movies, over-sexed Italian dancers etc. The more I watched the more I saw. I drove my daughter crazy pointing out ... 'hey that is a takeoff from ...'. If you are studying cinema or just have a movie trivia interest, Spice World certainly gives you more to argue about than Citizen Kain (sorry Orsen) or Pret-a-Porter (apologies to Robert too).

I was even more shocked to find that a couple of the girls actually had some talent (I won't name names to protect the worshipers) I've never paid attention to the Spice Girls -- their music is okay, but not something I would buy. There were some really lame parts to the movie (the flashes to the future, the whole baby thing, etc.), but overall it was somewhat amusing. It's too bad that it was all fabricated -- they should have taken a Madonna \"Truth or Dare\" approach -- maybe then the critics would have been more kind. However, I liked the cameo performances by Elton John, Bob Hoskins, etc. and I loved the takes on other movies and songs (e.g. Spice Girl Five aka Tarantino's Fox Force Five in Pulp Fiction, etc. and Meatloaf's line about \"I won't do that\").

So the Spice Girls aren't exactly the world's greatest actresses, but they never aimed to be. Yet their first attempt at making a feature film was nothing short of fantastic. The film follows a (busy) week in the live of The Spice Girls in the build-up to their first ever live concert at the Royal Albert Hall.The satirical cameo appearances (by such greats as Roger Moore, Meatloaf and George Wendt) blend well with the very funny script which pokes fun at the Girls, the media, and anybody or anything else that gets in the camera's way.Richard E. Grant, Alan Cummings and Claire Rushbrook all make fine performances as they desperately try to keep up with the fast-paced world that the Spice Girl's lead.The 'Speed' sequence with the bus and the whole alien spaceship scene (plus the very clever credits sequence) were undoubtedly three of the more memorable parts, but the photo shoot scene where they dress up as each other is also bound to make you laugh.Described as a thriller, with a little romance and a lot of comedy, Spiceworld: The Movie captures the hearts of Spice fans everywhere as their favourite pop artists rush to the stage in the final performance of \"Spice Up Your Life\".Despite the credits warnings of 'candy-coloured tarts with acting abilities lower than their IQ's', I found \"Spiceworld: The Movie\" to be very good, indeed! 8/10",

It reminds me of \"Kevin and Perry go large\", another movie you are in love with as a teenager but when you reach your mid 20s watching it makes you cringe.I don't feel this movie has any importance in this day and age.

This movie itself is ...well... OK I guess and would be watchable for people who were fully aware and interested in them in the mid-90s, but I am not sure anyone else will really get into this film.

However, my own reading of it is that it shows up the spice girls for what they really are; a group of talentless, uninteresting, stereotypes.  Remember that the film itself is an event, and so should be viewed not on a purely entertainment level, but also on a physical plane. Yes, the spice girls were selling out completely, and made an embarrassing spectacle of themselves by making this film, but then it is also a document of their final months as a band. Soon after the release of the film, splits within the band were noticeable and this lead - as I'm sure we all know - to the departure of geri halliwell, reducing the fiesty five down to a floppy four. The post-ginger spice viewing of this film is remarkable entertainment, and gives meaning to the in-band strain. Halfway through the film, the spice girls question the roles that they have been typecast into as to why they should be them. They try each others role for a photoshoot, but this is all swallowed down as fun and frolics, and just as long as ginger spice returns back to her normal bumptious and gory self, then that's fine. They are trapped in their glossy image, and they can't escape. There is no hope. The ending of the film, I believe, is not a happy one. They tried to resist the mould that had been set for them by their media image, and in the end they submit to it and have to carry on and perform for the fans that have paid premium prices to see the spice girls, and not five individuals.",

But because the girls are so fun to watch, and there are some pretty funny jokes and random humour in it, it manages to keep its head above the water despite having no plot to speak of.So y'know, if you want a fun bit of nothing that doesn't make a ton of sense but leaves you feeling kinda good nonetheless, this is a good movie choice.",

            "content": "It is a shame that most movies fail where an outrageous comedy such as Spice World succeeds. The back of the laserdisc that I purchased without seeing compared the movie as a cross between A Hard Day's Night and This Is Spinal Tap. You couldn't have a better comparison.I am not the biggest Spice girls fan, but writing this review in 2001 long after their 15 minutes of fame are over, I can be a little less closed-minded.Here is some questions that you in 2001 (and beyond) may ask of this movie:1) Is this movie is funny?Yes it is, I agree that if you liked A Hard Day's Night you will enjoy Spice World also. It is funny in the very same nature. A pop sensation gets into all sorts of trouble when they have to be both a pop-group and true to themselves. It leads to some hilarious sequences, some in a dream state.2) Do I have to like the Spice Girls to enjoy Spice World?It helps, looking back now on the \"Spice phenomenon\" of 1997-1998 I can think of no real reason why I disliked them, they are decent singers and each had their own distinctive style to them. It is funny in retrospect how much this group DID NOT share in the same style as the Backstreet Boys and N*Sync. The Spice Girls were separate entities, while today's boy bands aren't. The movie revels in this, each bit of dialog having wit and coming exactly from the lips of the characters that say them. Everything fits together beautifully and is seamless. Anyone with a sense of fun can enjoy this movie.3) Does the movie have camp appeal?Absolutely. You have many many fun and campy scenes. Hear Roger Moore say \"A chicken without a head can only know where it came from, but cant see where it's going. Don't be that chicken!\" or hear Victoria tell Geri how to help a sick boy out, \"Why don't you take your top off for him?--I know I was just joking.\" To which Geri replies, \"I know. No real point in that though, his eyes are sealed shut--Oh look NOW there open!\" At it's very least Spice World has HUGE camp appeal and look for the hilarious Bob Hoskins cameo!4) Is watching Spice World a religious experience?No. But you will have a good time if you have any sense of humour, and that is what movies are all about. Check it out, I bet you will like it!Peace out,Shawn",

I really got into the story; it's perfectly matched and it cares to make sense the whole running time, leaving the spectator without a single plothole. It's so good to see that the producers decided to not treat the Spice fans like morons, and brought up an inteligent and sensitive script.Some scenes are really brilliant, creating an unique atmosphere that brings your heart upbeat, tingling to joy some moments and downcasting to tears some others. I actually cried when the girls fought, It touched me so deep that made me feel all vulnerable inside. Thank God the film ends up O.K., and every time I remember that the Spice Girls broke up, I run to my nearest video store and rent this maravelous piece of art and watch it over again, so I can keep alive the fantasy that their are still up together.Overall, this is a MUST SEE  for any human kind. \u00a1Spice up your life!",

Looking back on it, I really can't believe that I liked this movie. I mean I don't think it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it's just really stupid. I remember when I was OBSSESSED with everything Spice: the music, the gum, the lollipops, the books, the movie, the posters, and yes, even the dolls. I think I still may have some of the dolls, and I'm sure they'll be worth lots of money (I know my Ginger Spice will be). Anyway, back to the movie. Practically everyone I knew went to go see the movie, and all of us like it. I think that most people hate it now because they are afraid to admit that they liked the Spice  Girls, or that they still do. I am not a fan anymore, but I have to listen to their music every now and then for memory's sake. I still even watch the stupid movie every now and then, also.

We have all the key elements - five girls who have assigned 'characters' which are not how they see themselves, a megalomaniac manager who will stop at nothing to get the girls to perform, the tabloid editor who reviles the media monster he has created.There is no plot to speak of - the girls are heading to the Royal Albert Hall for their first gig - and , erm, that's it.  Along the way they have some adventures, with both the actors and the girls sending themselves up outrageously.Particularly funny is Richard E Grant as the manager and Roger Moore's one liners - 'when the speeding melon hits the wall etc' are priceless.Ultimately, SpiceWorld is a fun piece of non threatening fluff that will make you smile.

After the Spice Girl's popularity had passed, I thought I might as well agree with everyone else, that it was the worst movie ever made. Years later and more neutral, I came across the movie in the basement and out of boredom, decided to watch it. And you know, after watching it, I don't think it was as awful as everyone said...I mean it's alright.",

And realize it's not as bad as you might fear (or everyone said when it was released). In fact, the Spice Girls vehicle is even enjoyable as shallow, but not so dumb entertainment, with a good camp quotient. The self deprecating humor is a good surprise, and the girls seemed to know where they were going - that is, nowhere fast as a \"band\" or musical talents. And the cameos are sometimes really hysterical - I dare you not to laugh at Sir Bob Geldof after his makeover. OK, \"A Hard Day's Night\" it may quite not be, but I wish every teen exploitation movie were as smart as this one. And I bet it will gain cult status over the years. Fear not and be among the first to jump on that particular nostalgia bandwagon !",

They perform all of their hits. You can't take a movie to seriously, when it has sill quotes in it, like, my personal favorite (and senior yearbook quote), \"The headless chicken cannot see where it is going, it can only remember where it has been. Do not be that chicken.\" My husband and I knew we were destined for each other because we both share an affinity for all things spice girls. The humor in this movie is timeless, and unsurpassed.

(I also think the Spice Girls are hot, and I have no problem watching them jump around.)It features spunky actors, silly writing, cute British film tributes/references, neat cameos, fun music (if you like that kind of music that doesn't refer to killing, sex, or whining), and is an obvious ride on the merchandising train that the Spice Girls were.There is nothing stupid, or bad about this movie. It's just simple fun. (And it features Sporty Spice!)If you were expecting an Oscar contender, than you obviously have little clue about what this movie brings to the table.

In a time when so many people in the entertainment business take themselves so seriously it is great to watch the five girls make fun of themselves, they knew their acting ability was minimal, except perhaps for Geri, who may have a future in this field. The plot works on several levels, on one hand it can be seen as pure slapstick but also their are more serious threads running through it, such as press intrusion, media distortion of offhand comments (such as Geri's remark about the pope) and the girl's dilemma of balancing their responsibilities between their management and loyalty to a friend (Nicola). This film came out at a time when you couldn't watch TV or open a paper without seeing articles about the Spice Girls, I think many people were put off the girls by this and hence the negative reaction to the film initially.

The acting was not just bad, it was so bad it made their singing ability look good... and they were playing themselves! Really, how hard can that be? Don't get me wrong, I'm aware it was suppose to be silly and not taken seriously, but I'm pretty sure it was also suppose to be entertaining... which it wasn't.

Damn your eating disorders, fluctuating weight and inevitable, ironic spiral into self-obsessed media prostitution, that ultimately is a mockery of the whole empowered-girl thing, which will lead to a lonely end of an untalented career.PS When will Mel C release the follow up to Northern Star? I totally loved the album!",

The girls have no motivation as characters and act as if they are paper cutouts brought to life whose only desires are to \"go crazy.\"The girls' antics only re-enforced the idea that: women are incompetent of dealing with problems aside from fashion and childbirth, profit is always more important than safety or artistry, and being good looking is what gets people through life.An overly trashy movie, for an overly trashy era.",

In fact, Spice Girls are really good singers and I appreciated that. At the end, the song \"Spice up your life\" is really good. If you saw the videoclip of this song, well, it is really bad but in the movie, when they sing it... it's really good. Also, to present \"Wannabe\" in a less commercial version was a good idea... it's not the truth but it looks more like the reality. A poor movie but a distracting movit with #1 music of 90's.",

Yes it is stupid, but in a really enjoyable way. The were a great group who knew what they were doing. Still enjoyable today. There are so many great appearances from great actors. They have Meat Loaf, Allan Cumming, Elton John, Elvis Costello, and the funny Roger Moore.

I undoubtedly enjoyed their music growing up, entirely truthfully... they did some bangers, don't @ me.\n\nAs for the film, which I probably haven't seen in 15+ years, I'll put it this way: Spice Girls as musicians: yes! Spice Girls as actresses: not quite. It's extremely cheesy and the acting is very subpar, but the likeability of Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton & Co. at least keeps it watchable; to me, anyway.\n\nRichard E. Grant commits to his role, while they also got James Bond himself, Roger Moore, involved. There are also a number of cameos. Their music is entwined well, I wouldn't class myself as a fan but I rate a fair amount of their songs.\n\nI can understand if you dislike this, I truly can, but I found it alright to be honest.

It doesn't take itself seriously. It knows exactly what it is. It is a satire about themselves, the music industry, and pop culture in general. Plus, there are some surprisingly authentic and tender moments in the movie. It also doesn't hurt that there are some seriously impressive cameos.\n\nEverything in Spice World means something much deeper than what appears on the surface. Every time I thought to myself, \"...ok this is getting ridiculous,\" I paused. Why are there aliens visiting these girls while they are trying to take a group piss in the woods? Why is there a photographer crawling out of their toilet? Why is there a montage of them dressing up as each other? I encourage you to watch this movie and when you start to think to yourself, \"why,\" (which will happen about twice every scene) don't just roll your eyes and shake your head. Really ask yourself, what are they trying to say?\n\nOverall, am I going to start telling everyone they have to go watch it? Yes, actually. Well, maybe not everyone, but definitely those willing to give it a second or even first chance. I think there is real merit to this film. There isn't much out there that takes a satirical look at celebrity and the music industry in as interesting and entertaining of a way as Spice World. Wow, I can't believe I just wrote that.",

What \"Spice World\" DOES accomplish is the cultural preservation of the late 90's Spice Girls phenomenon.  The film doesn't really have a plot; in fact, it is more of an anti-plot as the random flashbacks and dream sequences try to create some semblance of a story but just make everything more disjointed than before.  The lack of action brings all of the attention to the personalities of the girls.  If you don't have a favorite before watching this, you will after (or you will just despise them all, but they are actually pretty likable).  Despite the disdain of critics, this film was a box office smash.  While the Spice Girls have become a forgotten chapter in pop history, I appreciate that this film allows them to live on and serves as a reminder of how big they actually were.  If nothing else, \"Spice World\" will make you pull out your old Spice Girls cassettes and rock out to Wannabe like it's 1996.",

Ah, I can't believe subjected myself to this film along with the people involved. It is not that this is an unoriginal piece of crap made by bunch of chuckling and sneering dorks, but it is an inconceivable exercise with barely any plotting or direction. I wonder if anyone even read the script or was developed. I guess this is or was supposed to be a tongue-in-cheek and self-reflective parody which could have worked if anyone knew what was going on. The music is really bad and the costumes are barely tolerable, but not as much as the Spice Girls. Spice World follows the Spice Girls wherever they go with all kinds of inane ideas and caricatures with musical montages, and only separated when we see another character besides the Spice Girls which a lot of the scenes seem to have been cut from other scenes. We have Hugh Laurie, Elvis Costello, and Roger Moore just to name a few. I could not believe the disorganization throughout the whole film which could qualify for ridicule by Mystery Science Theater 3000 since we have a scene involving aliens. The Spice Girls are made up of Mel C, Mel B, Ginger Spice, Baby Spice, and Victoria Beckham. Their film debut and music are well in synched with each other in terribleness. There are even few random moments that I thought I was going to chuckle, but never did. I would place this film with Pootie Tang. I know you are going to wonder why I bothered to watch this film in the first place and it's quite a long story, but what compelled me to see this happened after seeing it in a list of films that were going to be removed from Netflix. I already miss the chance to see Donnie Darko which is considered a cult class. I do enjoy the so bad, so good film once in a while. I clicked hoping to get a chuckle at its terribleness, but was not prepared. I won't tell you what I want. What I really want. Oh and don't expect it to be sexy because I tried that as a last ditch effort, but didn't work too well.\"",

But to call this a movie, let's be fair, is a stretch. This is more like a collection of wild skits and music videos, jumbled together and rushed into movie theaters to capitalize on the bands ridiculous success.\n\nSo as a film, it's safe to say this is a complete failure, and a shameless cash in on the girl band's popularity. It simultaneously reinforces each member's stereotype, and yet complains about them. Tries to make us feel sorry for the girls with their grueling schedule and lack of freedom, yet presents the Spice Girls as spontaneous free spirits.\n\nOn the other hand though, the girls do get to drive around London in a Union Jack clad Double-decker bus driven by Meat Loaf!** The Spice Girls also have a close encounter and one of the visiting aliens, grabs Scary Spices's boobs! Richard O'Brien plays an uber-creepy paparazzo popping out from under fruit bowls, and the band's road manager is a wonderfully manic Richard E. Grant. Sir Roger Moore makes an appearance as a Bond-esk villain, resplendent in his Maoist suit, posing with an assortment of cute furry animals, including a piglet!\n\nThen there's the rest of the cameos: Michael Barrymore, Richard Briers, Elvis Costello, Bob Geldof, Stephen Fry, Jools Holland, Bob Hoskins, Elton John, Jennifer Saunders, Jonathan Ross, and yes, I've missed some out! Everyone involved seems fully cognizant of the kind of movie they're in, even the Spice Girls themselves, and just seem to be having fun with it. So while this movie in every measurable way, sucks, I find it impossible to hate!\n\n* Ginger(Geri Halliwell), Sporty (Melanie Chisholm), Baby (Emma Bunton), Posh (Victoria Beckham) and Scary (Melanie Brown)\n\n** Michael Lee Aday\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nThis is a movie that's really just for fans of the Spice Girls, and/or those nostalgic for that period in time. It will also probably appeal to people in the UK more than anywhere else, due to all the cameo appearances from British talent.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThis is bright and colorful, but a regular DVD or streaming show will do. One idea. You could host a Spice Girl's themed fancy dress party! Have everyone (yes, guys, everyone) dress up as their favorite Spice Girl in some of their more iconic getup's (Geri Halliwell's form-fitting Union-Jack dress was always a hit!). Play the music, watch the film, consume a few tasty beverages, and have a blast!\n\n\nBest Moments:\n\nA hack Hollywood writer is pitching a story featuring the girls as a team of crime fighters called Spice Force Five. He explains each characters role in the gang, and we watch the master of espionage, Sporty Spice, being lowered on wires over a Subbuteo*** table to score a goal. I also liked each and every time Baby Spice smiles (okay, what can I do? She was my favorite!) :-)\n\n*** A table top football (soccer) game.\n\nhttp://talkiegazette.com/spice-world-1998/\n\nhttp://facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\nhttp://twitter.com/talkiegazette",

            "content": "This frolicking British flick is colorfully insane every second of the way; this can clearly be seen from the impossibly-campy antics experienced by the Spice Girls between traveling tours to the girls' signature over-the-top costumes. The movie pokes fun at the girls' struggles with celebrity fame, media morons trying too hard to cash in on their brand and, of course, those malicious men who would love nothing more than to see the musical quintet dead in the eyes of the public. Borrowing more than a page from The Beatles' A Hard Day's Night, Spice World highlights the girls' best songs in strategic, and sometimes unexpected, locations; for example, their legendary \"Wannabe\" is sung impromptu at a local pub with a boom-box serving as the only musical backdrop. Like the Beatles' films, many numbers take place during concerts or recording sessions; however, unlike the Beatles, who performed glued to their instruments, Geri, Melanie G, Melanie C, Emma, and Victoria provide high-flying choreography in addition to their vocal talents. The ending song \"Spice Up Your Life\" demonstrates exactly why the girls were so popular. This sequence will make you want to get up and dance. \n\nThe film truly encompassed the decade of the 90's:  the obsession of retro furniture (just take a look at the interior of that traveling, double-decker bus!), platform boots so high they could reach the stratosphere, healthy amounts of \"girl power,\" and 'anything-goes' fashion (\"could somebody please tell me exactly what the dress code is here?\" one character remarks). The Spice Girls could have created a convoluted and overly-absorbing piece of cinematic self-promotion, (ie, the Monkees' film \"Head,\") but they have, instead, gone the more fun and carefree route by placing themselves in comic and embarrassing story-lite situations filled with fun, flair, and secret agents bottle-feeding baby piglets. My favorite sequence in when the girls are put through military training; each of the Spices don a green, unflattering camouflaged army outfit, except for Posh, who still retains her fashionable flash in a short, tight, army-patterned dress. It is silly to watch, sure, but I appreciate how the girls stay true to their public on-stage personas.\n\nThe upside and downside of Spice World is that its humor succeeds only half the time. While I believe taking the \"campiness\" out of the film would have been a major mistake, I also believe the film would have been much stronger as a whole if many jokes had been taken farther, instead of being cut halfway before reaching their humorous pinnacles. One such example is towards the end of the film when the British police stop the girls from reaching their concert at Albert Hall; Baby Spice approaches the officers with a pouty-puff display of innocence. Then... the scene cuts, and the girls (somehow) arrive unscathed to their concert a couple minutes later. If Baby Spice had gone farther in her pleas, (or if Ginger Spice had interfered by whacking the cops across their kissers,) I would have been more satisfied. \n\nBut despite the half-hearted attempt at many jokes, the far-fetched nature of the story disguised everything that did not work. I am annoyed by critics (both professional and amateur,) who give Spice World one star out of five. One star? Really? My personal rule-of-thumb is that one shouldn't call a film \"cheesy and all-over-the-place\" in a condescending manner if the film's intent was to present the world as being, well, cheesy and all-over-the-place. (Extra points to the alien encounter scene.) In all honest, I enjoyed the groovy and rockin' Spice World; while it did not ascend to the heights of A Hard Day's Night or Help, it is on-par with Herman's Hermits' musical comedies of the 60's.",
