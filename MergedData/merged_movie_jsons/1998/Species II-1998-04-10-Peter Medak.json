            "content": "Of course, killing the alien was no reason to stop the producers from making a sequel. The cliffhanger from the end of part one (a rat with alien DNA might spread it like a disease) was completely ignored though. Although we were told in the original movie, the alien DNA came from light years away, it is now found on Mars (just around the corner in astronomical terms), and astronauts take it home to Earth. Since there was a bit of gore and sex in the first movie, there is a lot more gore and sex in the second one, as if that could improve the quality in any way. We get a lot of clich\u00e9 characters, from the corrupt senator to the uncompromising general, and the survivors of part one are treated carelessly by the screenplay: Helgenberger lends a willing hand to cruel experiments, Natasha Henstridge returns as the alien's latest clone, but during the whole first hour of the movie, she has nothing to do except sit around in a glass cage. Madsen just needs to run around armed and look cool - he understandably gives a lackluster performance. The sequel was definitely not as intelligent as the original and tries to hide the lack of ideas with gallons of blood. I voted 8/5/6/7 for the 4 parts of the series.",

            "content": "A team of astronauts, returning from a trip to Mars, are attacked by an organism that oozes out of a soil sample taken from the red planet's surface; after blacking out for seven minutes, they awaken, unable to recall what has happened to them.Once back on Earth, the astronauts are subjected to several tests; whilst checking the blood sample from Captain Ross (Justin Lazard), the team leader, a scientist is mysteriously killed. When the dead man's body is examined, DNA is found which is similar to that of Eve, a human/alien hybrid (Natasha Henstridge) that has been created in a top-secret laboratory (from the same batch of embryos that resulted in Sil from the original Species movie).It seems that one (or more) of the crew of the recent Mars mission is host to an alien, and unless they are captured, they will endeavour to procreate ASAP with as many partners as possible.Species II has a very silly story, with some particularly daft plot turns (Eve learns to drive from watching The Dukes of Hazzard!), but with lashings of quality gore (including several gruesome alien births and a shotgun blast to the head), better alien effects than the first film, and even more nudity, this sequel is still very enjoyable and worth watching if you liked the original.Michael Madsen returns as tough-guy Press, along with Marg Helgenberger as science bod Laura Baker, and also turning up for the fun is the ever reliable James Cromwell as the senator father of space hero Captain Ross.If you're in the mood for some undemanding mindless sci-fi horror, then check out Species II\u0097it's not as bad as a lot of people seem to think!",

Now, I am not about to tell you that this is a great film, but if you set your expectations low, you are likely to have fun. Despite the icky (and variable in quality, though impressive in the last 10 minutes) special effects and the large amounts of blood and t&a, the film never becomes truly disturbing, because you're never meant to take it 100% seriously. Michael Madsen understood that, to be sure, and thanks to his trademarked coolness, he walks away with the picture. As for Natasha Henstridge, she has more or less a supporting part, but one that is rather imaginatively linked to the central story line. Overall, a movie with no artistic pretensions and, undoubtedly, many flaws (someone else already mentioned this; why didn't her head explode when she escaped from the lab?), but watch it in the right frame of mind and it's quite enjoyable. Do you know any other movie that features sex between slimy aliens?!?    (**1/2)",

            "content": "After returning from a mission to Mars, a team of experts' tracks down the infected astronaut carrying a parasitic alien before he can meet up and mate with a similar human/alien hybrid.A very rewarding sequel to a fine original, this one turned out to be very enjoyable. By adapting a more straight-up storyline instead of dealing with all the science and facts, there's considerably more action in this one in terms of splattered victims which seems to be the main focus of the first half. With an increase of splatter, there's some great kills and creature make-up used during those scenes, and the tentacled beings covered in slime generate a lot of fun, especially bursting forth from people's stomachs or chasing around the ground which are good times. Several other scenes with the alien children shooting their cocoons together and the effects work there allows even more goopy, gory fun in conjunction with a continuation of fun kills, miraculous healing abilities from both creatures and copious nudity. There are some flaws here, though, namely the decision to allow the captured male into the quarantined zone with the girl when there's plenty of knowledge to indicate his goal is to mate with her, as well as the film's rather tacky CGI during the finale when the practical effects were working so well. It loses some steam in the middle where they keep coming up short in the quest to stop him rampaging and raping woman as they're always on the other end of it, but otherwise there's still a lot to like here.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity, several Sex Scenes and attempted rapes",

            "review_title": "A Sequel to a Second-Rate Franchise with a Top-Notch Director",
            "content": "An astronaut gets infected with alien DNA during the first mission on Mars and runs amok on earth. Preston and Laura team up with a peaceful, genetically re-engineered Sil (Natasha Henstridge) to track the monster down.The first film became a cult favorite mostly because of the excessive nudity, near as I can tell. The plot was pretty straightforward and it does not stand out as one of those films that needed multiple sequels and its own franchise. And yet, here we are.Writer Chris Brancato was working with MGM and knew the studio was interested in making a follow-up to Species. He pitched an idea to executive Greg Foster where this time two hybrid alien women would strike. Foster liked it, but once Brancato went to \"Species\" producer Frank Mancuso Jr., he asked to \"approach this from a different angle, so that we don't have a tired retread of the original, as sequels often are.\" So Brancato took inspiration from \"The Manchurian Candidate\", where \"somebody on a mission comes back, apparently a hero, but actually with some terrible demon inside.\" We get much of the original cast back, and some really fine additional casting, including James Cromwell and a memorable role by Peter Boyle. We also get director Peter Medak on board, one of the great Masters of Horror (given his background in Hammer and \"The Changeling\")... and even aliens designed by no less an artistic authority than H. R. Giger. In many ways, this film exceeds the original.Having Medak on board brought a few key changes. When Medak was approached by producer Frank Mancuso, a condition of Medak's agreement was to hire on composer Edward Shearmur (\"Die Hard\"). Also, Peter Boyle is a friend of Medak's and they have worked together many times since the 1970s, so we have Medak to thank for this key bit of casting. Even production designer Miljen Kreka Kljakovic came through Medak. (Kljakovic is not a household name, but look him up -- from \"Delicatessen\" on, he has made a long list of great films.)And yet, the critics hated it and even the cast was disappointed. Michael Madsen expressed his opinion saying, \"Species II was a crock of (doody). There are a number I'm not very proud of. The movie studios can't mind that much, as they haven't contacted me to tell me off about it. I'm honest - if I've made a bad movie, I want my fans to know what they're letting themselves in for.\" (Regardless of what Madsen thinks of the film, Medak loved working with him.)I have to disagree with Madsen. The film is actually intelligent and clever in a way. The special effects were ahead of their time, even if they may appear dated today. The head regeneration scene is a bit cheesy, but even that allegedly cost $75,000. So it was not a cheap effect. I suspect when people look back now (2016), they will see this is a better film than given credit for.The Scream Factory disc has an old audio commentary ported over (and it is as good as ever). We also have a new interview with Natasha Henstridge, which gives us a bit of a rundown on her career and how she transitioned from modeling to \"Species\". Oh, and don't forget new interviews with the effects crew. Whether you think this is a good movie or not, these interviews are valuable and really put 1990s horror and science fiction in context.",

The premise is hard to buy, but hey, it is science FICTION. The effects are not bad, and the acting is fair. There is a lot of gratuitous sex. Michael Marsden may be the bright spot in this average sci-fi flick. I wouldn't pay to see this in the theatre, but on video....

            "content": "This movie begins with a REALLY stupid premise: they recreate the SIL from the first film (who killed many people and is still played by Herstridge)and they try to figure out a way to kill her in case creatures like her invade Earth! (!!!???) Meanwhile a manned mission to Mars returns to Earth unknowingly infected with an alien virus which produces a MALE version of SIL (Justin Lazard). Like the first he has to mate with women who get pregnant immediately and the babies FORCE their way out.Now this IS a stupid movie--no two ways about it. The plot is dumb full of plot loopholes, the dialogue is howlingly stupid (I THINK some of the lines were meant as jokes), it's VERY gory and contains a large amount of female nudity (naturally Lazard is never shown completely nude). BUT, as a stupid B movie, it does work. I was truthfully never bored. It's only 90 minutes and DOES move quickly. Also the special effects aren't bad...but not as good as the first.The acting, like in the first one, varies. Herstridge is actually not bad--she was terrible in the first one. Michael Madsen walks through his role. Marg Helgenberger was surprisingly good (considering she has the worst dialogue). James Cromwell is excellent as a slimy senator. As the main SIL here Lazard tries--but he's given nothing to work with. He is a very handsome man with a very nice body but can't do anything with his character.And it has a silly ending which sets up Species III. There is one very disturbing aspect of this picture--there are MANY views of nude women torn open and dead as their babies come out. We get the idea with the first one but they keep constantly showing other victims. It's unpleasant and sick...it gives the film a very sick edge. Because of that I can only give this a 6. Again--this is NOT a good movie but a very good/bad one.",

Basically three astronauts succeed landing on Mars, and not long after they leave they are knocked out by a creature, and for a while, you're not sure which one is infected and will mutate. Meanwhile, Dr. Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger, from the previous film) and her scientists have cloned the DNA that made the previous creature (Sil), and she looks exactly the same, they've named her Eve (Natasha Henstridge, also from the first film), she has been made friendlier, and she is fine as long as their are no men around the facility she is locked it. You soon realise that Patrick Ross (Justin Lazard) is the one who is infected, the other two are fine, and that he is having numerous amounts of sex, and making many children that will eventually evolve/mature into monsters like what we've seen before. The female astronaut dies, but Dennis Gamble (Forrest Gump's Mykelti Williamson) is accompanies Laura, and Press Lennox (Michael Madsen, last from the previous film), the hunter. Also starring Basic Instinct's George Dzundza as Colonel Carter Burgess Jr., James Cromwell as Senator Judson Ross and Myriam Cyr as Anne Sampas.

            "content": "Wow... were there really racial stereotypes as bad as that in the movies less than ten years ago? Probably the most offensive thing out of many offensive things in Species II, Mykelti Williamson plays a man who can't utter a single sentence without it being a reference to himself as a \"brother\", or how much he wants some \"bootie\". There's even a reference to him having large genitals, and of course when he gets the girl, she has to be black. God forbid he should actually date a white girl, right? I'm actually amazed they didn't just stick a mop and bucket and a bowl of KFC in his hand and have done with it. An absolutely risible representation of black man in a trash movie.Naturally, this being Hollywood then the strong (ie. white male) survive to dominate the picture. Sure, the women can talk about science, but they're there to be told to shut up and sit back so we can concentrate on Natasha Henstridge's breasts. Of course, in these sort of films the makers forget that someone gets to be an alpha male by brains as well as testosterone, so we get the thick as bricks Patrick (played by Justin Lazard) walking around doing whatever he pleases. Hey, he's a red blooded, wholesome American - he gets to do what he wants, right? That includes having the exploitative titillation of the entire premise (alien propagates via sex) subverted with an attempted rape. There's even a delightful cut scene instated on the DVD where he kills a transvestite. Lovely stuff.In the opposite corner as the tolerable face of ego-led masculinity is Michael Madsen in a \"what the Hell is he doing in this?\" excursion. I see from IMDb that two straight-to-video sequels were released. As I can't think why on Earth I watched the first one, let alone the second, then I think I'll give them a miss. Truly repulsive film-making.Oh, one last thing - look out for the glass when Eve (Henstridge) breaks out of her cage. It actually shatters before she touches it.",

The script has obviously been hacked about and changed so often that sub-plots started in one place never resurface or get resolved in another place. When faced with any choice the characters in the movie always choose the one most likely to get them killed. The gore factor is high and almost never justified. Female nudity is frequent and almost never justified.Also in its favour it can be said that the creature effects are not bad though rather dark to hide the wires. H.R.

A sequel to the original film really could have written itself as the door was left wide-open at the end, but instead of following on directly from the first film; we've got a thread about a mission to mars thrown in to further things. Three astronauts go to mars, and one of them comes back infected by alien DNA. The supposed national hero lusts for the recreated 'Sil' (a clone, a bit like Ripley was in Alien 4), who finds herself confined to a high security prison under the command of Dr. Laura Baker. However, when the astronaut begins killing women; the government realise that some serious clean-up work is in order, and proceed to track down Press Lenox; apparently the only man capable of helping to stop the alien.The film doesn't have a lot of depth as aside from letting us into the idea of the alien originating from mars; it's pretty much just a spin-off from the original. Characters from the first film return in identical roles, while new blood such as Mykelti Williamson don't do much to make the film any more interesting on the character front. It's obvious that this film wasn't given big studio backing as it all feels very cheap, and this is mostly down to the rubbish CGI, which was also featured in the original film. In fairness, here it isn't used as often and the effects that don't use computers do look rather nice. There's not a lot of gore on display, but there's some inventive kill scenes and the alien, being based on a H.R. Giger creation, is suitably imaginative. It's a shame that original star Natasha Henstridge is so underused, as her role feels a lot like it's only in the film as a tie to the original; and I'm sure that I'm not the only one who wouldn't have minded seeing more of her. Still, while this film really isn't very good; you can't expect brilliance from a sequel to a minor mid-nineties hit, and I did enjoy watching it.",

We have seen what the alien was like in \"Species\". Now it is the other gender as well...NASA's recent mission to Mars brings back an unexpected surprise. For years many scientists have wondered whether there was life on Mars, but the astronauts that land on it bring back life with them. Alien life... The soil samples that the astronauts bring back from the planet contain alien DNA that infects the crew. Only one of the crew is fully infected with the alien DNA - Patrick Ross. Once back on Earth, Patrick goes about mating with human women and producing offspring on at an alarming rate, becoming more alien than human. But with two aliens on Earth, it is not long until the two are bound to cross paths. And then, it is the end of the world as we know it.The film brings back Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger from the 1st film, back to fight the alien menace for a second time. But having a male alien and a female alien out there is bound to cause problems. And even though Eve is half human, anyone can see that the other alien half is going to get in the way. But as you will see in the film, the scientists get themselves into trouble by firstly creating an alien, and then re-awakening dormant alien genes in her to find Patrick. It just goes to show how powerful the sex drive is... alien or human.",

            "content": "Species II starts with the first manned mission to Mars code named 'Excursion' manned by Patrick Ross (justin Lazard), Dennis Gamble (Mykelti Williamson) & Anne Sampas (Myriam Cyr) reaching it's destination after 11 months in space. Patrick Ross becomes the first person to walk on Mars, he takes various soil samples & heads back to the Excursion. When back on board some strange slime starts to pour out of the sample cannister... Back on Earth the astronauts are treated like hero's but while at a fund raising event Patrick has sex with two d\u00e9butant's (Nancy La Scala & Raquel Gardener) whose stomachs open up & human like baby alien creatures emerge. Patrick asks his Father Senator Judson Ross (James Cromwell) for help but is ignored as Judson doesn't want any bad publicity, Patrick continues to create alien offspring using various prostitutes, pole dancers & horny housewives. Meanwhile Dr. Orinsky (Baxter Harris) is attacked & killed by Patrick's mutant alien blood & General Carter Burgees (George Dzundza) calls in professional hit man Preston Lennox (Michael Madsen, returning from the original) & Dr. Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger, also an original cast member) who has created Eve (Natasha Henstridge, yet another returnee) from a frozen alien embryo (mentioned in the original) who seems to have a telepathic link with Patrick, but to use Eve's vital ability to it's maximum potential they must turn her almost completely alien...Directed by Peter Medak I have to admit I get a real kick out of Species II & I like it more than the original Species (1995), I just love the thing & for that I apologise to no one. The script by Chris Brancato moves along at a nice pace & is never dull or boring which is always a good start & it features more blood, gore, sex & nudity than just about any other major studio film I can think of. This is pure exploitation for the modern generation! Species II knows that it's all about blood & nudity & doesn't shy away from it, in fact it revels in it! The actual plot is about as silly as you could imagine, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense & is somewhat clich\u00e9d & suffers from simplistic one liner type dialogue but what the hell, I just like to sit back & enjoy the bombardment of nastiness that Species II takes great pleasure in serving up. The characters are a bit dumb especially the comic relief black guy & the fat General with one eye but hey, it's all good fun. There are some great gore scenes in Species II, exploding stomachs, a cool effect when Patrick blows his head off with a shotgun & it grows back, slimy alien tentacles, a nasty looking cut up blood splattered corpse on an autopsy table, someone has their guts pulled out & lots of blood splattered all over the shop. Species II doesn't skimp on the sex & nudity either as it's all here, a threesome, straight sex, alien sex, a motel complex full of prostitutes, a strip club & rape. Trivia: there is even a deleted scene on the DVD in which Patrick picks up a woman who turns out to be a transsexual so after finding out he breaks her neck. Technically Species II is pretty good, director Medak uses some cool shots like zooming into people's eyes & nice angles like the Star Wars (1979) rip off start as the spaceship zooms across the screen only this time Medak places his camera above it instead of underneath. The special effects are actually very impressive & hold up well even now & don't forget Species II is over 7 years old & that's a long time in effects development. The CGI is solid & doesn't embarrass itself while Steve Johnson & his team pile on the slime & blood in some great yucky over-the-top scenes. The aliens designed by H.R. Giger look organic & visually cool especially Eve although this is where some of the effects become a little bit ropey. I liked the production design with the contrasting hi-tech labs & the old dark run down outhouse building at the end complete with pulsating purple alien cocoons! The acting is not going to win anyone any awards but Madsen as the cool hit man Lennox is likable as usual, strangely the gorgeous Henstridge isn't in the film that much & only gets topless at the end but it's worth the wait boys... Species II is terrific entertainment as far as I'm concerned, I just loved all the nudity sex & gore, I was in heaven! Species II has a bad reputation which is fair enough, but to be honest I don't give a s*it if anyone else likes it because I did & that's all that matters to me. Great entertainment for those with the stomach but anyone with delicate moral sensibilities should stay away...",

At some point the film makers realized they had nothing to work with, and decided, \"Hey, let's make this one as bad as we can!\" The gore is plentiful but laughable, the dialogue and script ridiculous, acting and production values are close to rock bottom. The best thing you can say about it is that it's short.However, there must be some redeeming value to it, because I did watch the whole thing. I shut off \"Anchorman\" after 30 deadening minutes. I also bailed on \"Resident Evil\" after about 45 minutes. Perhaps if Species II had gone on ten minutes longer I might have hit the Stop button.I've read that Species III went direct to video.

At least the original 1995 film featured some impressive visual effects and playful nudity, whereas this sequel only has mean-spirited gore and gratuitous sex scenes. Remotely interesting is that the screenplay isn't just an identical re-telling of the original, but a fairly new Sci-Fi story....albeit a very BAD one. Once again, the scripting team behind \"Species\" associates alien life forms with insatiable sexual hunger, only this time the outer space monster is a male and thus even more determined to copulate all humanity to death. The first successful Mars expedition returns to earth but something awry happened to the three astronauts during the seven minute radio-intermission. The same extraterrestrial monster that provided yummy Sil with her alien DNA entered the bodies of the astronauts. One of them is immune, the second is destroyed fast but the final alien-carrier; the handsome and very popular Senator son Patrick Ross, quickly becomes an unstoppable killing machine. Beautiful Natasha Henstridge plays the clone of her own original character, who's telepathically linked to the new alien/human hybrid. Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger both return, but their characters' personalities seem to have changed drastically. The respond to certain situations different than before and the script doesn't even bother to enlighten us why they failed as a couple. These are still acceptable shortcomings... Much worse is the total lack of tension, the provocative dialogues and the exploitative portrayal of women. This movie will probably be enjoyed the most by younger and inexperienced horror & Sci-Fi fans that disregard a good, plausible plot on their search for graphic gore. We're really served a lot of that: exploding heads, spontaneous alien-births, exaggeratedly long tentacles and torn open torsos. Yuck.",

When one of the crew is killed by an infection the race is on to catch the crew's captain Patrick before he `fxxk's the human race into extinction'.  The military re-team Baker and Press Lenox with crew member Gamble to hunt down and destroy the alien before it breeds.This is a vapid piece of trash that doesn't even bother to take itself seriously.  The plot is daft in the extreme and was clearly thought up while the scriptwriters were driving to the pitch meeting.  The action is split into two camps.  First we have the horror sections which consist of rubbery monsters etc.  Secondly we have the human side with Michael Madsen et al - this is almost a comedy - certainly the actors are taking it seriously.  The horror bits are just for the sake of it - a man blows his head off in full colour for no discernable reason.  The story have no excitement, drama or tension, the effects are mainly poor - the `alien' being the worst and the final showdown being laughably terrible.The cast are terrible and deliver their lines with all the professionalism of monkeys.  Madsen and Helgenberger are good at this type of rubbish but even here their lines are poor and their performances are rough.  As with the first Species film - the cast seems to be full of good actors who didn't read the script.  James Cromwell is OK but he has been in much much better fare than this.  Williamson is not a great actor but has been in better films.  Here he is only allowed to be a `black sidekick' and comes across like a sub-par Will Smith, among the dialogue he's given is the clanger `I'm going back to Africa on somebody's ass!'.  Maybe the only thing that attracted him to the film is that he shares his last scene with a gorgeous nurse (Evelyn Ebo) who is by far the sexist woman in the whole film!  Dzunda is a famous face and really should know better.  Lazard is interesting but ultimately he's just a model-type.  Richard Belzer turns up for 30 seconds as the President - best known as Munch (Homicide: LOTS) he clearly is trying to not be Munch, but he is too good for a cameo in this trash.The use of nudity and violence is aimed at the teenage boy market.  There are lots of cheap effects and lots of titillating scenes (two women/one man scene, lots of sex) for the boys.  However if you want anything more than a bit of self relief then I'm afraid that this isn't for you.To sum it all up I'll let a quote from Helgenberger's character say it all - `this is awful, just awful'.",

I have a bad habit of watching movies even if I already know I'm going to hate them (this is why I've seen Scary Movie, 2 and 3, for example), so this may be why I've been a little bit numbed to idiocy in the movies.I can certainly recognize stupidity at any level when I see it in the movies, and there is plenty of it in Species II, but it takes a lot more than this movie has for me to describe it as the worst movie I've ever seen or a total waste of celluloid or some other such nonsense. It is certainly not, for example, a \"grade Z exploitation flick, ripe for the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 treatment.\" In a massive lapse of cognitive function, scientists, including Dr. Baker from the 1st movie, have decided to make a clone of Sil, this time named Eve, to study her more extensively than they had the chance last time. They somehow made her more docile and controllable (although still female), and she cooperates with them, suffering through the tests and tortures that she has to endure for them to demonstrate things like her remarkable ability to heal. After one such session, Dr. Baker walks Eve back to her glass holding cell, and Eve tiredly asks Dr. Baker something like, \"Why do you do this to me?\" Eve spends her time reading and learning to drive by watching Dukes of Hazzard, her favorite show, when she's not being poked and prodded by people in white coats. The only thing that the scientists seem to remember about Sil from the last movie is her unstoppable sex drive, so men are not allowed anywhere inside the area where she is kept, at least until the end when Dennis Gamble (Mykelti Williamson), one of the men on the mission to Mars casually walks in, walks right up to the glass and tries to flirt with her. Good thing she was unimpressed by his genetic code, otherwise they may have had a serious security breach on their hands.While scientists were busy studying Eve for some kind of weakness that they could use should another, ah, outbreak occur, other scientists are busy successfully completing the first manned mission to Mars. On the way back, there is a lapse of communication for seven minutes, I think, and the next thing you know one of the scientists has been infected with alien DNA, much like the stuff running through Eve's veins. Evidently the smart aliens (in this series, the ones in space, off-screen, sending intelligent radio signals to earth) have intercepted the Mars mission and sent a scout back to earth for another shot at those pesky humans. But fear not, it's not long before the slimy monster aliens take over the colonization efforts.Given the feeble plot, it's not hard to see why Species II focuses entirely on the sexual aspect of the alien species. Natasha Henstridge is not most, but ALL of the draw that this movie has, so they have to pander to who they know is in the theaters. And judging from what happens during the movie, most of the people in theaters are adolescent boys who really shouldn't be watching this movie. Okay that was a guess, but while Natasha gets topless for about three seconds, there is still extensive nudity and group sex in the movie, most of which results in bloody birth scenes stolen from the Alien movies, as he steadily compiles a growing herd of offspring.Dennis Gamble, the token black guy and comic relief, has no purpose but to constantly complain that he can never get any booty, until scientists inform him that because he's a carrier of sickle cell anemia, his blood can be used as a weapon against the alien. In the movie's defense, there is a great scene where Patrick Ross, who was infected in space, finally reaches Eve, with whom his hormones have been communicating since he got back to earth, and they have an intense love scene from opposite sides of thick glass. Interesting in that it is a shining moment of skillful acting in an otherwise dreary slog of drivel.Also, I have to admit that I was impressed with the head regeneration scene, but only in the way that I was impressed with many of the special effects in Hollow Man. It was a fascinating thing to watch, despite all the while being very obviously a special effect. If you absolutely loved the first film (and I mean LOVED it), then you may enjoy this one slightly as well. But in the Species series even more than normal, if you didn't like the original you'll hate the sequel. And in some cases, hating this sequel doesn't even require a lukewarm opinion of the original.",

Since Gamble's blood has Sickle Cell, he told Lennox to use his blood and Gamble stained the machete with it just for good measures.

            "content": "A tired, by-the-numbers sequel to a film which wasn't good enough to deserve a sequel in the first place. SPECIES II has a threadbare plot about aliens which has been recycled so many times that it's merely a continuation of the first film, offering up nothing new in the way of surprise or intrigue. Alien man mates with woman before turning into big scary alien creature. That's all there is to it.The actors aren't particularly bad but are served by an atrocious script which makes them all sound like idiots who are one step behind the events proceeding around them. Michael Madsen is his typical laconic self (as he is in all of the films he's been in) but is given virtually nothing to do but wave a gun around a bit. He just goes through the motions. The black lead is also on hand for comic value, and surprisingly he doesn't get killed at the end, which makes something of a change. Marg Helenberger is virtually unrecognisable and is also given little to do with her role. Natasha Henstridge, on the other hand, was never much of an actress in the first place and she only gets naked once, briefly, at the end, which is something of a let down for fans of the first film. Justin Lazar tries his hardest to look scary and scared in equal measures but he's nothing more than a bland, macho face picked more for looks than charm. I'm sure Peter Boyle turned up in a small role as a lunatic asylum patient but I could be wrong.So, all in all things are looking pretty bleak from this film but it does have two things to win it an audience. The first is the nudity. A number of actresses are willing to strip for the camera which seems almost as bad as the exploitation films of the '70s. The second factor is the special effects. The mission to Mars at the beginning has some great SFX, very similar to those in EVENT HORIZON. However, the gore and monsters are not so impressive. The gore is simply too computerised, as it was in WISHMASTER; it looks very fake and insubstantial. The monsters are all of the CGI-waving-tentacles variety and soon become tired and not very interesting. The only monster of interest is the big scary computer one at the end, which is pretty good, but it dies far too easily in what seems like a very rushed finale. And what was it about the ending in the ambulance which made no sense whatsoever? SPECIES II is run-of-the-mill stuff which passes the time but ends up ultimately disappointing every viewer, including fans of the original. As I expected really.",

The good news is that (most of) the principal cast returned (quite a rarity in sequels these days) and it sort of follows the Terminator/T2 rule where the original bad guy is now the good guy, helping to defeat something even worse.Despite the original alien, played by Natasha Henstridge with her trademark lack of clothes, being killed off in the original, she's been cloned back now to help the human race hunt down a second alien (this time male). Now\u0085 that doesn't sound like a bad plot for a B-movie, however, my main problem was that Natasha Henstridge is hardly in it! She only really comes into the film in the final act and, by then, it's a little too late to make any real difference.The story focuses on all the wrong characters. Even though you also have Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger reprise their respective characters, the film spends too much time on those related to sub-plots and a new sidekick who is little more than a wise-cracking helper who's constant slang and (alleged) witticisms about his lack of sex soon become annoying.But, when the story gets it right, it still retains enough of the fun and bloodthirsty chaos of the original to make it just about watchable.

I don't mean to imply that this movie is \"good in a bad way\" like \"Plan 9\". (That attitude gets old after a while.) I honestly think this motion picture, while certainly not an all-out success, does qualify as about an hour and a half of gooey fun.When I went to my local theatre to see this, one thing I did notice was just how much fun the rest of the people in the theatre seemed to be having. Sure the plot, which I won't even bother trying to explain, makes no cohesive sense. But while handing over my five dollars to get my ticket, I honestly don't recall ever even expecting it to. One thing I certainly didn't expect however was for this to be as incredibly gory as it was. As the various body parts exploded in cascading rainbows of slime, I couldn't help but feel refreshed, especially when in comparison to \"Scream\" and other films of it's ilk where Brandy or whomever else can get stabbed violently, but never bleed a single drop. I got the feeling that my fellow viewers in the theatre felt the same way as, from my vantage point at the back of the room, I watched their silhouetted heads duck and weave as the digital sound made it seem like dismembered alien limbs were flying right past their heads. I watched the ladies present throwing their hands up in front of their eyes to shield themselves from the carnage, with their boyfriends nudging them in the shoulder going, \"Look honey, Look!\" One woman in particular, after a nasty sequence involving an autopsy, actually said out loud, \"That's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen.\"ANY movie that can do that, can't be (and isn't) as bad as everyone wants you to think it is.",

This time out three astronauts are the first to land on Mars but on their way home there's a seven-minute gap that they can't remember. It turns out one of them (Justin Lazard) is contaminated with alien DNA and now he's impregnating as many women as possible so that they will give birth to alien babies. Back in the lab, Eve (Natasha Henstridge), a replica of the alien from the first film, has a connection to the latest alien while Dr. Baker (Marg Helgenberger) and Lenox (Michael Madsen) try and figure out what to do next. Despite three cast members from the original returning, this film doesn't have any of the originals charm or excitement and in the end you can't help but feel that you're wasting your time watching something that was only made to try and make some quick cash. The movie doesn't work on any level but the biggest sin is the fact that it's deadly boring from the opening scene to the final one. The opening stuff in space just looks plain cheap and the special effects are more laughable than anything else. The end chase tries to recapture the magic of the film film but fails as there's not a bit of suspense and by the time the ending does happen you simply don't care what happens. Everything in the middle is just mind-numbingly bad as we get to see Madsen and Helgenberger discuss what they should do next while evil government official want to do things a different way. Both Madsen and Helgenberger appear to be going by-the-numbers as neither add any life to their characters. The same is true for Lazard who's just not very convincing in his role as the alien. The supporting cast includes Mykelti Williamson, George Dzundza and James Cromwell but none of these fine actors bring much to the film either. Henstridge stays in a cage for the majority of the running time so she doesn't get to add much but thankfully she does strip towards the end of the picture. Peter Boyle appears uncredited and steals the film in his small role.

With a few notable exceptions sequels are inferior products and FAECES 2 continues the traditionDoes anyone remember NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 2 ? If you do then you`ll remember it ignores a very important plot device involving Freddy Krugar and his victims , and it`s the same with this film which totally ignores any internal continuity with the first movie . But you don`t really notice this when you see the makers have ignored important concepts like logic...First of all a manned mission is sent to Mars . Why ? , there`s no real reason ( Except to set up the plot of course ) for this happening . Yes I do know the Americans sent a dozen or so Americans to the moon but that was during the cold war when they were engaged in a space race with the USSR , both sides knew that if one side get there first the other side would have suffered a massive national humiliation hence both the USA and USSR spent massive amounts of money and expertise on trying to get to the moon first . Why do you think NASA stopped sending men to the moon ? Because they`d won the space race at the cost of billions of dollars while the Soviets weren`t prepared to spend vast amounts of resources on a meaningless race where they`d be only second . Space travel isn`t cost effective , that`s why NASA have a real life problem in sending manned missions to Mars because there`s no money to fund such a project . If someone found unlimited resources on Mars like oil NASA would be able to get funding but this isn`t mentioned in SPECIES 2 . NASA send a mission to Mars because it`s there and get some laughable sponsorship deal from soft drink and sportswear firmsNo hold on tell a lie , it transpires halfway through the movie that the US military want to put military bases on Mars . Military bases on Mars ? Against whom ? If it`s military bases with their missiles pointed against countries on Earth then where`s the logic in that ? Wouldn`t you keep the bases nearer their targets ? It`s a bit like General Tommy Franks keeping all his front line bases in Iceland when intervening in Afghanistan and Iraq. And neither does this contrived plot point explain how NASA got their incredible budget to go to Mars .Talking of the military , isn`t there some required basic fitness level for the military ? I`ve never seen a serviceman weigh four hundred pounds . This sums up all types of carelessness on the part of the makers , things like Lenox holding his pistol sideways . Why would he do that if the sights are located at the top of the gun ? Oh and the first man to step foot on Mars is the world`s most famous guy but can walk down a street without being recognised , until the script requires it . And is DNA a living sentinent being ?

Upon recently rewatching the first two, I thought perhaps it was time to polish my review a bit. Don't get me wrong, the movie is still trash\u0085 but it doesn't deserve quite the lashing I originally gave it.The movie starts in space as the first manned mission to Mars approaches the alien world. Patrick Ross sets down on the planet's surface as the Earth rejoices. Upon returning to the ship, something from the Martian rock samples infects him and the other astronauts as they make their way back. After receiving a hero's welcome, Patrick violates the sexual quarantine with a pair of sisters and quickly (in rather nasty fashion) becomes a father to two little alien hybrids. We also learn that a more docile clone of Sil from the original exists and becomes extremely aroused when Patrick does the deed. Laura (from the original movie), who cares for Eve and now runs the program to find weaknesses in the alien species, is able to bring Press Lennox back into the fold when it becomes apparently that another alien hybrid is on the loose. Meanwhile Patrick has become more alien after a suicide attempt and starts rapidly expanding his family, leaving a trail of gutted women in his wake. Press and Laura are able to determine that Patrick is the cause after the female astronaut dies in nasty fashion and Gamble, the third astronaut, is found to have avoided infection due to being a carrier for sickle cell anemia (the aliens cannot handle genetic disorders). They eventually have to activate Eve's alien DNA in order to track Patrick via a psychic link the aliens possess. But this allows him to sense Eve's existence and almost break her out after turning himself in. He escapes, killing his senator father shortly after, and returns to his spawn in order to have them cocoon and reach maturity. Eve manages to escape and Press, Laura, & Gamble follow her to Patrick's hideout. As Eve and Patrick begin to mate, the team uses a toxin derived from Gamble's blood to kill the cocooned offspring before the final confrontation. Eve briefly regains her humanity and attempts to help but is killed via phallic tentacle being shoved down her throat. Laura then sprays him with the toxin as Press uses Gamble's blood on a pitchfork to end Patrick. As the place is cleared out the following morning, Eve's body is loaded into an ambulance but her abdomen begins to swell as the movie cuts to black.This movie is a very strange contradiction. It is SO bizarre in so many ways yet so painfully dull in others. The direction and most of the acting is just plain meh. Whereas the original had this weird charm to it, this one just feels a bit\u0085 off. The practical effects are amazing but there's the fact that women give birth minutes after sex via uterus eruption. Not to mention the third act alien sex scene and tentacle murder. I'm still stunned that a major studio made this movie for a wide release and it isn't just some strange live action hentai tentacle porn. I also find it weird that in the age of bizarre and \"so bad it's good\" movies being popular that something this weird isn't discussed more. But I feel that says a lot about the movie: insane and weird but somehow very forgettable. If you have a strong stomach and like strange movies, maybe try this. Otherwise, just stick to the first one. 3/10",

You might want to see this one simply out of curiosity since you have seen the first flick, else stay away from this movie.",

You could or rather they could top the amount of nudity though and that they did!

Premise regards a mission to mars in which the Senator's son is inflicted with an alien virus. At one point he is witnessed blowing his head off with a shotgun only to reform it. He leaves a trail of bloody pregnancies everywhere he goes. Natasha Henstridge returns as a recreated alien only this time she's with us. It all winds down to a battle between two creatures that is in itself impressive, but we have to endure a lot of crap to get there. Well directed by Peter Medak with fine production. Henstridge handles the action well but this time she is basically switching sides and changing her name. Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger reprise their roles but they are virtually flat. James Cromwell is wasted as the Senator. It is sad to see him go from Babe and L.A. Confidential to this. The same can also be said of Mykelti Williamson after playing shrimp loving Bubba in Forrest Gump. Unnecessary sequel that does nothing more than attempt to repeat the success of the original as well as present gooey special effects. The first film was little more than the umpteenth ripoff of Alien so do not expect a genius plot from this garbage. If you thought the first one was bad then be forewarned of this. Score: 2 / 10",

The plot here just wasn't as interesting as in the original \"Species\" movie. But hey, isn't that usually how most sequels fare?The acting performances in \"Species II\" were good, though it was obvious to see that the actors and actresses were struggling with an inadequate script that offered little to work with in terms of storyline and character development. It was nice, though, to see returning cast members Natasha Henstridge, Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger reprise their roles from the first movie. \"Species II\" have James Cromwell, Mykelti Williamson and George Dzundza on the cast list as well, among others.Now, something that was a major improvement in \"Species II\" in comparison to the 1995 movie \"Species\" was the special effects. They definitely upped their game here. And the H. R. Giger alien designs are just hands down amazing and so cool. I loved that about \"Species II\", especially because there was paid more attention to the details and bringing the alien creatures to life on the screen in more adequate lighting and with proper practical effects. Just a shame that the storyline was an anchor holding the movie back.Sure, \"Species II\" is watchable and entertaining enough for what it was, given its limitations and such. An okay enough sequel, but it could have been much better.My rating of director Peter Medak's 1998 \"Species II\" movies lands on a five out of ten stars.",

As the film ends, we see a rat with a glint in it's eye, then a long tongue reaches out to zap some food. We know the 'species' survives.\" Presently I saw this first sequel, \"Species II\" and perhaps expected it to start near where the first one left off, but it doesn't. In what seemed to me a bit of scientific foolishness, an astronaut lands on Mars just for a few minutes, while the rest of the crew orbits, then after taking three core samples re-joins the mother ship, and puts the samples into cryo-cooled chambers for the trip back to Earth.Meanwhile a new female creature named Eve was made from the dead Sil's DNA, and she has been carefully molded and studied with the hopes of unlocking the secret to fighting off the alien DNA and its species. Natashia Henstridge is still beautiful in that sister role.SPOILERS FOLLOW. As the astronauts prepare to head back home, we see one of the cryo chambers defrost, pop open, and a copious amount of snot oozes out and onto the floor, and during a brief blackout attacks the one that was on Mars, infecting him without anyone being aware. Back home, his main desire is to have sex with young naked women and impregnate them with this alien DNA. One mad scientist, who was in the looney bin, theorized that Mars was once very similar to Earth, but it was rendered barren eons ago after this strange species inhabited it and, if we are unable to fight it off, a barren Earth will be next.Sensing an urgency, Eve escapes and eventually battles the new alien that had taken over the astronaut's body, and both apparently die. Meanwhile the lady scientist who had been working with Eve sprayed a poison she had developed which killed the encased alien pods stuck to the ceiling, before they had a chance to metamorphise into full blown aliens.

But, in one of the planetary samples, a specific fungus carrying the alien race from the first SPECIES film thaws out on board the American space shuttle and invade the body of Patrick and astronaut Anne Sampas(Myriam Cyr). For some strange reason, Dennis Gamble(Mykelti Williamson)wasn't invaded by the alien. Later testing might prove that being a sickle cell anemia carrier might've saved him. This also might be a key to killing them because it's proved through experimental testing by Dr. Laura Baker(Marg Helgenberger)on clone half-human/half-alien Eve(the VERY, VERY sexy Natasha Henstridge)that the breed are able to regenerate cells.When women are being found mutilated soon the government will be on the lookout for Patrick, who has been having sex with various females(hookers, lovers, admirers, etc)and impregnating them with half-human/half-alien children who burst from the stomach not too long after mating occurs. When these children reach a certain stage in numerous days, they will turn into a cocoon and once released will be fully grown to terrorize and conquer the human race. Colonel Carter Burgess, Jr(George Dzundza)is the military muscle behind pushing the experimental project for finding a way to kill the alien species and when he discovers that another is on earth(..after the murder of a scientist who discovers alien genes in Patrick's blood), he calls in Press Lennox(Michael Madsen), the kind of special ops man/bounty hunter with a skill for finding prey he target. He's the man the government call in to do their dirty work. He'll team with Dennis who sees for himself, when Patrick blows his head off with a shotgun(..with it subsequently regenerating before his very eyes), what the alien is. Laura, who has bonded with Eve during their period of time together(..while it's Laura's job to find a way to kill Eve, it's really her agenda to protect her from harm), will also have to team with press to stop what could be a global disaster from taking place. Patrick must be stopped and the storage place of the cocooning aliens must be found before it's too late. The most prominent threat..if Patrick and Eve mate an even more advanced alien being might emerge perhaps too unstoppable for anyone to handle.The cast doesn't have a lot to do except quote their lines and the film is rather derivative of other similar sci-fi films using threatening aliens, but I found it decently entertaining in a race-against-time sort of way. I wanted more Henstridge, here used more as a sympathetic being, and the pace is so fast plot can not catch up..but, I'm one in the minority who doesn't believe this is the worst sequel ever. It was just not as well developed, screenplay-wise. It does feel rushed, but has some gruesome alien-attack sequences such as the aliens protruding from the bellies of their human mother hosts. It's forgettable, but could be looked at as a flick to watch when you got time to kill.",

The dialogue in the sequel is trashy in a number of places which I think downgrades the film distinctively as opposed to what it would have been had they paid more attention to making the dialogue more intelligent. Frequently very gory & bloody and also suffers from plot errors in that one of the members of the space team who was exposed to alien DNA isn't considered suspect along with the others even after the other crew members have become fully infected with the aliens DNA. Dumb scripting. Its weird in the sense that they seem to be aiming for a younger audience in this one but if they are aiming for a younger audience they only made the film more death & sex orientated & generally cruder-that is some kind of a warped take on what younger people respond to. I think this film damaged the career of Michael Madson who was pretty good in the original and made Natasha Henstridge a non entity in the film business also. It looked like the budget was fairly generous for the film but I doubt if they made it back in the box office. It's always a mistake to treat the audience as if they are morons whose idea of a good time is slurping beer through a beer hat.

            "content": "In the first movie, scientists managed to create an alien life-form by utilizing certain DNA-altering procedures sent from an extra-terrestrial radio source. The result was a half-human, half-alien monster that once released into the world had the capability to destroy all human life as we know it. Fortunately, an emergency team was assembled which destroyed the alien before it could propagate. However, apparently not content to let matters rest, the U.S. government decides to recreate that same alien life-form under what they consider to be even better security. Ironically, the top-secret project is headed by a scientist named \"Dr. Laura Baker\" (Marg Helgenberger) who just happens to have been one of the people who helped destroy the first alien a few years previously. At the same time, a manned space mission to Mars blasts off even though one of the scientists involved in the process warns of the possible existence of alien DNA there that might have been responsible for wiping out all basic life on the planet. Naturally, rather than heed his warnings, the U.S. government arrogantly confines him into a mental institution and proceeds full speed ahead. Sure enough, after landing on Mars two of the three astronauts become infected with the alien DNA and they are heading back to earth-where the alien life-form named \"Eve\" (Natasha Henstridge) waits in her secure lab facility. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that typically sequels are seldom as good as their predecessor and this particular film is no exception as there were some scenes which were simply too preposterous. Additionally, I didn't care for some of the special effects which included all of the scenes involving the alien offspring. However, the story itself was fairly interesting and the fact that both Natasha Henstridge and Marg Helgenberger were cast in this movie certainly helped this film as well. Admittedly, it's not a great movie by any means but viewers who liked the first movie might find this sequel somewhat enjoyable. Overall, I rate it as about average.",

Compared to the first movie this one adds very little new and originality.Seems like the only reason why they put Natasha Henstridge in this movie was to connect this movie with the first one. Her character is a totally better one this time and quite frankly I think the movie and particularly its story would had been better off without it. It would had also made this movie more fresh and original to watch. 2 other actors from the fist movie also re-appear in this one; Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger. Michael Madsen is basically always awesome to watch in any movie and any type of role he plays. He is a pleasant addition to this movie, even though of course its far from his best movie role, which is also due to its silly script and poor dialog. The chemistry he had with Helgenberger in the first movie is also completely gone in this movie.Seriously the writing of this movie is so lazy. Her we have an alien that is being hunted down, who is inside the body of the first man who walked on Mars. That makes him about the number one most famous face of the world, yet he can walk around freely and the military and all secret agencies have a hard time tracking them down. Really not the most believable and likely plot premise. The movie is filled with some other holes and big improbabilities.There also are some new characters appearing in this movie, not played by the least actors. Mykelti Williamson, George Dzundza and James Cromwell are some well known names. There also is a quite nice little cameo by Richard Belzer as the U. S. president, which is quite fun if you know Richard Belzer. Unfortunately none of the great actors can really spice up the movie its script.The movie obviously had a lesser budget to spend this time. At times the movie even looks like a made-for-TV movie, which also might be due to the fact that director Peter Medak has a lot of experience with TV movie and not as much with big theatrical movies, even though he is capable of something better. Just watch the 1980 horror movie \"The Changeling\". Despite that all, the movie its effects are all quite nice looking and the movie also has some good looking gore to shock with. What the movie is lacking though is its good eerie atmosphere of the first movie. It also makes \"Species II\" a less effective movie to watch.Also having a male alien this means a less seductive and therefore at the same time also less interesting movie to watch.It has some good elements and nice moments but basically you overall are better off by just sticking to the original.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

But so goes the story of \"Species II,\" a weird little conundrum of a film from director Peter Medak. A sequel to the mildly entertaining 1995 original, \"Species II\" has always been a bit of a sore spot for both audiences and for its own cast. Heck, even lead star Michael Madsen once infamously referred to the film as a \"crock of (you know what)\" in an interview. Its storyline is contrived. Its handling of characters suspect at best. And its sense of pacing and resolution underwhelming to say the least.And yet... I kind of enjoy it. Yeah. I'll admit it.It's not even a case of being one of those delightful \"so bad, it's good\" kinda movies. It's just sort-of fun to watch despite its faults. It's a glorified Saturday morning cartoon for grown-ups, filled with gooey gore and plenty of bared breasts and bottoms, designed to appeal almost exclusively to our inner teenager. It's pure kitschy exploitation junk-food. It's bad... but it's what you'd call \"fun bad.\"Three years after the escaped alien-human hybrid Sil was destroyed, astronaut Patrick Ross (Justin Lazard) returns from a mission to Mars a changed man... Little does the world know, however, that he's been infected with an alien toxin that begins to take over his body and transform him into a fiendish monster. Attempting to build an army of offspring, Ross begins to impregnate woman after woman with his deadly spawn. And it's up to some returning heroes (Michael Madsen, Marg Helgenberger), along with a clone of the original Sil called \"Eve\" (Natasha Henstridge) to stop his deadly scheme!Director Medak, best known for the swashbuckling comedy \"Zorro, The Gay Blade\" and the wonderful haunted-house picture \"The Changeling\", does a fairly admirable job here. It's a well-crafted film, with some top-notch design work and a fantastic sense of visual execution. Medak creates plenty of moody sequences and does well with the script he's working off of, with a strong sense of flow and composition. And of course, as was the case with the original, the creature effects and gory deaths are just as mind-blowing as ever, especially thanks to the contributions of H.R. Giger. Say what you want about the film, but the aliens are just awe-inspiring and absolutely gorgeous.And indeed, it's this execution, combined with the charming talents of the returning cast that manages to salvage the experience. Even if he hated the finished product, Madsen is great in his returning role as former mercenary Press Lennox. It's a fun character archetype, and Madsen plays the part to perfection. Helgenberger is given some more intrigue and adventure to work with here, and she improves on her already very solid turn from the original. And I thought Henstridge was even better here than she was in the first film. She's given some more emotion this time around and also a bit more overt action, which was nice to see.Unfortunately the new cast is pretty uniformly terrible. Lazard is a dull villain who fails to inspire dread much of the time, and his wooden performance feels forced and oft-uncomfortable. It's only towards the end when he goes all in that he becomes any sort-of credible threat. Mykelti Williamson, whose usually a pretty solid actor, unfortunately falls flat on his face as the shoehorned comic relief- a catchphrase-spewing African American who punctuates every other sentence with contrived slang. And even James Cromwell and Peter Boyle- two classy and classic actors whom play minor characters- don't do well at all with their respective roles. They seem confused and lost as they fumble over their lines.The film's structure and writing are the film's biggest downfall, though. Writer Chris Brancato's script is trite and silly, with a lot of head-scratching moments that don't add up, and weird sequences that seemingly contradict the prior film This isn't helped by the oddly nonsensical tone, which bounces back and forth between horror and comedy so often, you occasionally find yourself laughing at the scares and wincing at the jokes. I also took issue with the fact that this is a film where characters often behave stupidly just to contrive scares- including one unintentionally hilarious scene where a man actually touches infected blood with his bare hands for no reason whatsoever. And the pace is just nonsensical at times, with the film speeding up and slowing down at random intervals to the point it becomes distracting.And yet... I don't hate this movie. The returning cast is just too good, the visual direction is just too strong and the exploitative sex and violence is just too fun for me to wholly dismiss the finished film. It's bad. Oh, it's very bad. But it's the sort-of bad where you can sit back, pop open a beer, and have a good time watching the insanity before you unfold. Especially with some friends to riff alongside you while you crack fun at its silly moments. \"Species II\" earns a below average but watchable 4 out of 10 from me. It's one of those sequels that's objectively a total failure... but is still enjoyable despite its faults.",

            "content": "The first manned trip to Mars takes the alien that we met in '95 back to Earth. They don't realize this right away. Or maybe they do, and simply cannot openly say that what we before were naive enough to combine with our own DNA(yeah, nice thinking) is now apparently a glob of smart goo. That moves. Jumps. And it can \"take over\" what it comes into contact with, of organic life(and it won't merely lead to a tongue extension, either). I know I'm having trouble typing it. This time, the infected is a man, so we get numerous women that undress in front of, and copulate with, him. Species is kind of a cheap, low-profile, gore-fest kind of horror, that benefited from a fairly impressive cast. This is the direct sequel(where things get bigger, and yet are as, or less, effective), where three cast members return, two of whom in the exact same roles(Madsen and Helgenberger) and the last playing something new based on what she was in the predecessor(Henstridge). Well, actually, that last thing isn't entirely true... her part is basically a cheap and easy way of bringing her back, as it was hard to do so after what happened at the end of the original(which you'll know if you've seen it). The script is basically the writer coming up with a simple, easily explainable way of making a follow-up, and taking it to a slightly higher level, sacrificing common sense in the process. This has a pretty stupid plot, and a good bit of it doesn't make sense. Worse even, some of it leaves you confused, which is almost offensive to even the dumbest of viewers, as the premise of this is about as simple as they come. This has decent pacing; the first time you see it, provided that you're prepared for how bad it is, it may keep your interest for most of the film. The acting ranges... the majority of it is B-movie level and below. I'm not kidding, some of the dummies and animated creatures(the designs are reasonable) in this thing deliver the better performances. The characters aren't particularly interesting or credible. A few of them are clich\u00e9s and stereotypes, like Dennis Gamble's, who's basically the typical black stereotype... speaking 'ghetto', hunting booty and generally just not really adding anything at all to this. The special effects are somewhat impressive, at least for the time. They hold up pretty well over time, too, including the CGI. That, coupled with an early feeling of optimism that this will eventually improve(which it doesn't, trust me) makes the flick bearable to watch, but it doesn't really have anything worthwhile to offer. I recommend this to those who know what to expect(many hot chicks, nudity, sex and bloody, often grotesque, violence) and, well, want it. 3/10",

Like any young good looking pair on a Saturday night, they are looking to get laid. Only problem is that this will result in a race of aliens that take over the would. A good reason to practice safe sex.But of course Americans are a little bit scared of sex in their movies (the good guys always do it missionary style and the bad guys have the fun kinky sex). The result is a dry sterile movie which doesn't know how to explore the dark side of the topic material (humans and aliens having sex).It would have been better to hide the sex and leave it to the viewers crazy imagination. It would be scarier or sexier (depending the imagination).",

Next thing, if you go to a sequel for a movie where the original was pretty gory, aren't you going to expect for the sequel to be a few times worse? People need to give this movie a break and realize that a lot of time and effort went into making this movie, and you can't go complain about a good constructed gore fest movie, when you went to that movie for the exact same reason to begin with, knowing it was going to be terribly gory. Don't be such a harsh critic and hate this movie! Sure the acting wasn't all that great... but isn't it hard to act a role perfectly when you have to pretend there's a horrible alien standing in front of you or ripping out of you?

There are so many things terribly wrong about it that it is funny. There are some lines that come out of the mouths of some of these supposed actors that you can't help crack up laughing about! For example, after the hero is done getting it on with one of the ladies, she says, \"wow you really are a hero!\" I mean c'mon how is that not funny? The hero tries the best he can to act, but you can tell he really has no idea what he's doing. Besides all the things wrong with this, it does have some pretty decent effects especially from 1997. The part where said hero shoots a certain part of his self, when it comes back that is pretty cool, even by today's standards. I would recommend this as maybe a drinking game. Say every time a line is said that makes you laugh, when it's not supposed to be funny, you take a swig. Don't take this seriously, at all, and maybe you'll enjoy it. At the very least fast forward the talky stuff and watch some of special effects. I personally loved the end fight. Those creatures are pretty cool looking.",

For example, the attempted rape by Patrick was distressing to watch. There is no story anyway so why not just focus on the monsters and the effects but naturally in these movies there is a lot of stupid dialogue and superfluous scenes.

            "review_title": "Worst Movie I've Ever Seen",
            "content": "OK, I know I wrote one comment already, but I really feel the need to expand on it.This is quite simply the worst movie I've ever seen.The script was so full of holes it didn't just break my suspension of disbelief, it tortured it. The most glaring example is how Patrick and the other (female) infected astronaut failed to mate despite being stuck together in close proximity in a spacecraft for the year or two it takes to get from Mars to Earth. Then there was that ludicrous scene where Eve escaped. Yeah, Sill got out because the cage they kept her in wasn't strong enough... so of course they're not going to make Eve's cage out of anything stronger! And they've been experimenting on her for years but never bothered to test whether or not their rifles would be effective on her, or whether they should use heavier weapons! Then there's how they send a small number of lightly armed mostly untrained people after her and Patrick, as opposed to a heavily armed SEAL team. And remember how Patrick's blood mutated into some tentacle monster that killed a guy when they tried to test it... guess what was never mentioned again!Don't even get me started on the realism aspect. I mean, a two minute pregnancy in a normal human woman... I'm sorry, even by sci fi standards that's an insult to all medical science. Whoever thought it up clearly has no clue about how pregnancy & the female body works. I don't care if they're fatal: a fetus that grows like that would never survive long enough to reach viability outside the womb, all you'd get is an instantaneous miscarriage. Mind you, it wouldn't be an issue if this was a decent movie in other respects, but it isn't.The acting and dialog were truly terrible. I'm sorry, I just can't get emotionally involved in what's happening to these people at all. They have all the believability and pathos of a glass of water. The ONLY character I ever got any emotional investment in was that nameless woman Patrick grabbed out of a supermarket and tried to rape, and that's just because it's a situation that naturally pushes any decent person's buttons and actually felt fairly believable (it happens in real life after all, minus the \"spawn evil alien baby\" part).The thing that made the original Species surprisingly good was that Sill was a person who was interesting and who you could sympathize with to a degree. Patrick is neither. I think they should have just let Sill's son survive (hey, if those things can survive a headshot they should be able to survive third degree burns), I think he'd have made a much better alien. Then again, the people who made this film would have screwed that up just as badly.The general tone of the film was \"let's throw lots of blood and tits at the screen so nobody can see the plot holes!\" I have no problem with blood and death in a movie so long as it's in good taste, I LIKE horror movies, but this isn't. This is blood and death used as a substitute for decent story, characters, and acting. It's very obvious the scriptwriter and director put no effort into this thing whatsoever. From the glaringly obvious plot holes to the gratuitous rip-offs of better movies like Alien and the Thing (notice that Patrick's alien form looks remarkably like the queen from Aliens!).On that subject, I find the depiction of sex in this film probably its most distasteful aspect. The film has a lot of sex in it but that sex is anything but sexy. It has an adolescent surface titillation aspect to it, but under that it's all about gore and death, something icky to be scared of. It's juvenalia.Now I realize a movie about some freaky alien creature that wants to have sex so it can spawn some sort of freaky alien baby is inevitably going to involve a rather creepy form of eroticism, but the original Species wasn't anywhere near this juvenile. This is sex the way an emotionally troubled 14 year old virgin thinks of it. I'd be inclined to agree with other viewers that it's misogynistic and exploitive except the way it presents male sexuality is even worse.",

I enjoyed it more than the first Species that I saw a few months ago. Maybe people didn't like the sexual predator being male versus a female in the first movie? My rating would've been higher than a 6 had the scientists followed proper protocols when handling unknown alien biology. Where's the biohazard suits? And why did the alien predator try to kidnap a woman in a daytime grocery store versus sticking to finding women in strip clubs and hookers in seedy motels to mate with? He made two dozen offsprings following that plan. There were also inconsistencies with the female alien's character. Other than that, I enjoyed it.",

            "content": "* out of ****Species was a terrible movie that featured lazy writing, no sense of pacing, and laughably bad special effects.  It was virtually a complete bore and a sequel was most definitely not asked for.  Yet, MGM still went on to make one, which is bad, but unlike the original, it's actually not dull at all. As a matter of fact, it's so full of gratuitous gore and nudity that it never threatens to bore the viewer.  Of course, you have to take in the fact that the script is even worse than the original film's.This time around, we have Eve (Natasha Henstridge) as our titillating female alien who was cloned from Eve.  She's supposedly a good guy, which leads us to the movie's villain, astronaut Patrick Ross (Justin Lazard), who has just returned from an expedition to mars, decisively a changed man.  Apparently, he's been infected with alien DNA and is now on a mission to impregnate as many women as possible, thus leading to the births of young alien children, all of which could possibly lead to the destruction of the human race.I'm laughing as hard as you are.  The plot is simply atrocious, but someone felt obligated to make the film anyway.  I'm sure it was a made for a target audience in mind, most likely young teen males who thrive on gratuitous gore and nudity.  Anybody wanting something resembling intelligence and good taste should avoid at all costs.As a sci-fi film Species 2 is a total failure.  The landing on mars is poorly done with bad special effects.  The film's ideas are basically rehashed off of better (or rather, more entertaining) movies like Lifeforce and Alien.  The alien design is definitely uninspired and is often laughably awful.  This sort of CGI is done in complete overkill, especially in the ludicrous finale.As a horror movie, Species 2 isn't the slightest bit frightening, but it succeeds in doing two things: grossing out the viewer and placing a countless and annoying amount of jump scenes.  Justin Lazard isn't a very intidimidating presence, thus for scares you have to rely on his alien form, but as I said before, the visual effect is awful and absolutely ineffective.Keep in mind Species 2 has a desire to outslime its predecessor, which it does.  There are scenes that feature babies popping violently from their mothers' stomachs, a man blows his own head off in graphic fashion, tentacles burst out of people's heads, and so on.  If this is your cup of tea, then by all means drink it up because you'll probably have a good time with this movie.It also feels rather odd for the movie to feature so much nudity.  I do realize that it's an attempt to attract viewers and that it is about women getting impregnated by an alien, but none of the nudity or sex scenes resemble anything near being erotic or titillating, considering all the gore that occurs as the end result.  It just gives the movie a disturbing edge that's more distracting than anything else.  Well, either that or it just adds to the unintentional laughs.  Either way, it doesn't bode well in terms of the movie's quality.I believe it's time to mention the script.  Oh, boy, this thing should be hung in some sort of museum of schlock because it ranks as one of the worst sci-fi pieces ever written for a major studio.  You can tell how ridiculous a movie is when Henstridge's character learns how to drive a car by watching \"The Dukes of Hazard.\"  The dialogue's even worse, with actor Mykelti Williamson saying some of the oddest things, like \"Getting back to Africa on their asses.\"  The line makes no sense, but it's fitting for a movie with the same problem.Performance-wise, I have to say it's also embarrassingly bad.  With the exception of Marg Helgenberger, everybody else is absolutely horrendous. Mykelti Williamson is forced to say some of the worst dialogue, and as comic relief he's cringe inducing.  Natasha Henstridge and Justin Lazard are easily the worst.  Both are so bland and dull, the effect is unintentionally hilarious.Despite all this, I have to say that Peter Medak's direction is actually fairly decent.  He does nothing groundbreaking but at least he knows how to play the material and he has some sense of pacing, even though it's made mostly uneven by the poor acting and dumb writing.  At least Medak gave a good attempt.The final scenes of Species 2 hint at the prospect of another sequel. Knowing Hollywood, I'm fairly certain it will be made sometime in the near future, most likely as a straight-to-video release.  So, just for now, we're safe.",

            "content": "From its very first scene, \"Species 2\" is shocking, because  \"Low Budget\" isn't even strong enough: It looks and plays like a student film.  Even the space scenes look cheap and half-finished, and this is well before the story dives into themes that are either bland cliche or ridiculously overdone. It screams \"B Film\" of the variety you thought had died 40 years ago.  There are buckets of blood and tons of fleshy explosions, gory, squirming tentacles everywhere, and much of it is filmed with the victim perfectly centered in the frame, usually with his or her face in clear view to exaggerate the cartoonish horror of it all.  YES, it's that kind of movie... Extended shots of corpses lying with their innards strewn about, and blood everywhere, vivid, gloppy red, and glistening under gratuitously bright lighting.There is even an over-the-top lesbian scene which could have been snipped directly from the Spice Channel.  And let's face it.  I am a chick, so I can see boobs whenever I want.  So long, drawn out boob-shots aren't that interesting to me.  In the first \"Species\" there can at least be found some male counterpoint to the female exposure,  (I am *more* than willing to sit through boob shots if it means getting some glimpse of Mike Madsen in the deal.) but that is not the case here.  This movie seems to be all about Boy Stuff, being littered with \"babes\" and guys trying to score all the time. It does not satisfy female tastes even in the roundabout way that the original film did.Even worse, this film does almost nothing with character.  While the original had a solid cast that spent significant time fleshing itself out, this movie skims over everything except the activities of the main alien, who is not interesting.   In the first \"Species,\" we got to watch Natasha Henstridge begin as an ignorant and speechless child, and gradually integrate with humans by learning their language and behaviors through trial and error.  Here, the alien is a split personality jock (who looks like a 1980s Tom Cruise), and dislikable from the very start, not at all rewarding to watch or learn about.  The other characters just seem to be going through the motions, and there is none of the seriousness or realism that we saw before.  To complete the unbelievable cliche, they have even added a wise-cracking black guy to the cast... You know that one?  The one who's always saying \"booty\" because that's the word-of-the-year?\"Species\" had one very noticeable weak area, and that was the ending, and the poor decision to stage it in the sewers.  This movie does have a fairly nice wrapup, as it takes place in a barn and there's some good old fashioned walloping, stabbing and wrestling-- perhaps the only high point of this dumb movie, and the only capacity in which it is superior to the first.Still, it's a drag and a shame. And like I said... literally shocking in its amateur execution.   Watch this one first, and it will make the original \"Species\" look like the 'Citizen Kane' of SciFi Horror.\"Species 2\" is really ideal for Mystery Science Theater.Score: D-Avoids an F only because of Madsen's presence, and the very end.",

Species II apparently took a wrong turn in development, and went further down the \"B\" side, instead of the \"good\" side.For all of the people complaining about the sex scenes- that's what the original Species was about, too.  Here's the main unwritten plot; Natasha is a beautiful female alien, and she goes into heat when she needs/wants to mate.  No amount of window dressing is going to obscure that.  Now, considering that plot, why watch the movie if you don't want to watch sex scenes?  (If you wish Species/Species II went *further* with the sex, though, I recommend Femalien and Femalien 2)Unfortunately, the movie just isn't as fun as Species.  Natasha looks great, but this time we get the equal-opportunity-murders of a male alien, killing women thru sex, until he's aware of Natasha's presence.  Somehow, the guy isn't as fun as Natasha to watch.The special effects are bad, and the plot trappings are kind of lame (Mars landing?  Now?).

She is now hanging out in a sealed bubble, attended to by female scientists. You see, if Eve espies a man, she is likely to freak out and go into the kind of terrifying mating frenzy that made the first movie such a riot. I have an ex-girlfriend like that. Anyway, these martian-DNA-tainted astronauts are out there, and only Eve can stop them. So it is a battle to the death between hot-looking naked Natasha Hensridge and some equally naked muscly astronaut dude who has become the alien.Sound silly? Well, my God, it is. Don't bring your fascination with astrophysics or biotechnology with you when you pop this DVD in the player. Nope. Get some buddies, pop open some brewskis, microwave up some popcorn, and have a good laugh ridiculing the film. The alien monsters are totally hilarious.

It was probably because of the director's commentry. On re-watching it with my mum (who liked it and has a really high tolerance for gore) I found that it wasn't all that bad. I listened to the commentry by Medak, and it sounds like he actually set out to make a good movie, but failed. But I had to laugh when he said that he only put nudity in this only when it was nesscessary. Is he kidding? There is soooo much nudity in this that it could be put on a porno channel. But, I must say I enjoyed it and the real stars of this movie are the Ms Henstridge's breasts and, to a lesser extent, the special effects. The DVD is good too, but the extra scenes on it are only sex scenes extended to contain more thrusting and more hilarious tongue antics involving Lazard and Helgenberger (who looks hotter than ever with long hair.)

But it was a surprisingly well thought out exploitation film about an alien woman trying to mate. The high levels of nudity and gore made sense and it worked despite its obvious flaws. Species 2 is exactly what Species could have easily been.I'm not going to bang on about it being an ugly, low effort and completely tasteless film, but that is what it is. The idea going into this one was bigger is better. That means more gore, more sex, more action, more aliens and of course, more boobs. And after a while it all falls flat. I have no issue with films featuring nudity, but at about the half way point there had been so much of it I just wanted to see these people put their clothes back on.The story? Oh, that sucks. It feels like it is trying to do 2 things at once. Retell the first film with bigger stakes, and bring back Natasha Henstridge for another outing. I loved Henstridge in the first film, as it played to her strengths (ie she was new to acting, so they kept her mostly wordless and had her reacting to this new world), but in this one she is hardly in it and is putting in little effort. It feels like she is misdirected. As for the raised stakes, the idea of the evil alien being male this time is a good one, but that is the only praise I will give it.The first film felt like it had worked out its science and managed to tell a story that worked well, with obvious meddling in the finale that soured things a bit. This one is pure nonsense, which normally I don't mind, but this film still insists on playing by the 1st films rules.Other than that, the effects are awful, the monsters are horribly designed and the acting and action suck. Michael Madson is clearly phoning it in and occasionally possibly drunk. The final fight ends with a pitchfork and some air cannons. It's shot like everyone just wanted to get it over with and go home.There just really isn't anything to recommend. It doesn't even work as sleazy schlock as it's mostly boring and takes itself way too seriously, while also trying to work in terrible one liners. If you like the first one, you'll hate this one. If you didn't like the first one then this won't win you over. Only if you are very, very curious and don't mind being bored to tears, then I will recommend this. Simply put, don't bother.

The alien nested itself in the body of a young astronaut whom, when back on earth, immediately starts to reproduce by having sex with as many women as he can.  As stated in the movie by hero-on-duty Michael Madsen \"They can f*** the human race to pieces.\". Not only is there a male alien on the loose, there's also a cloned female from the first alien (see Species 1).

They are essentially the same film, with the first film having the advantage of overall better acting and, of course, being the first film. The second film actually has better effects, some of the same actors, but suffers from sequel-itis. Of course, its biggest drawback (in the minds of many) is that, unlike the first film, the alien/human predator is male. This means that he spends most of the film raping females, which reverses the situation in the first film. No one made much of a fuss about the sexual violence in the first film, because it was the Henstridge character committing it. But its there (check out Henstridge's attempted forcing sex upon the male in the pool and at the end for examples.)

What makes this film \"feel like\" it's something more than the silliness it is is the presence of a lot of good actors. But don't let that fool you. No-one took anything seriously in making this film, so don't think for a minute that you should either. The original SPECIES, while no classic, was a \"serious\" thriller. This one is decidedly not.In a film full of plot holes and anomalies (other people here have already identified many of them, though nothing really adds up if you think too much about any of it), my favorite one is this: the Patrick Ross character is rolling around in bloodbaths for a large portion of the center section of the movie -- and yet he always seems to have a fresh set of clean and pressed clothes. He must have had to take numerous showers and changed his clothes---and yet...when would that have happened? Or does his ability to regenerate his DNA extend to his clothing as well? ;)I know, this is the least of the movie's problems, but it represents how silly the whole film is.Yet all it's goofyness is absolved (somewhat) by our knowing deep down that it has its tongue subtly but firmly in cheek. Don't take it seriously, and it easily becomes a good time on an evening with a bowl of popcorn and nothing better to do. There's a lot of decent actors in it, and most of them seem to be in on the joke. And, as ever, it doesn't take much armtwisting to look at Ms. Henstridge.",

The plot is interesting at first with the whole Mars set-up, but ultimately pointless with no real connection to the 1st film.

Oh yeah....its films like this which make Aliens look even better than it already was.What's next....the direction was really dull and lifeless....One of the saving graces of the 1st film was its visual flare, the artistic style of the directing...and of course, the special effects were fairly poor, as expected truthfully.Overall....rent it if you like watching crap....and for those who unfortunately seen it already....you probably want to shoot yourselves for wasting your time...just pray your head doesn't grow back.",

Guess they thought \"Hey, people like the blood. Lets add more this time...\" The gore appears to be a desperation move in this flick. And speaking of desperation, we move to the...other....reason the original got a cult following. The soft core porn and, almost random, nudity. Taking that little ingrediant, and like gore, doubling it. Not to be funny, but watching the original on your own...when the nudity arrived...its hard to keep your friend down...this time it just over doses it a tad, almost making it feel awkward considering this is not meant to be a porn video. I'm giving it 7, which kind of sounds contradictory considering all I talked about was the bad things. But it is...at times...decent.

Michael Madsen's character was the most laughable along with Mykelti Williamson's . Their lines, f*** words were so stupid that you simply couldn't not to laugh. Some lines reminded me of Alien Resurrection's Ron Perlman (few lines were just awful, though acting and the movie were just superb unlike the one we talk about now). After all, Michael Madsen couldn't resist playing leading role in big studio movie. Overall acting was as if I were watching some video game FMV intros. Well, don't blame the actors - blame the screenwriters. When dialog is horrible, I guess you can't make some scene out of it. Maybe it was the question of money for most actors who reprised original characters from the first movie. The concept of killing Species by spraying some human diseases cells is rather stupid I'd say. Also supposed bursting of women's stomachs who gave birth to little species strangely resembled accurate opening of the Aliens' eggs. I don't get it, why does astronaut woman have sex with his boyfriend dressed like 18th century maid after 10 months in space? And there are loads of funny stupidities in the movie that won't make you yawn. I think the movie even with such poor plot could be much better if the whole tone was darker and scarier, without unnecessary lame humor. There is certainly more facts about Species' life cycle which supposedly would set Species universe and make franchise popular (as Aliens, Predator). That will help comics for now. They should think of some decent screenplay if they will ever consider to do a sequel (it is welcome). FX at the end were OK. And yes, Natasha Henstridge... She is beautiful, who cares about acting?

            "content": "Rating: 1 / 5\nSo Bad it's good rating: 2,5 / 5\n\nThe First \"Species\" was a B-Horror film that was mostly an excuse to have Natasha Henstridge take off her clothes as often as possible, \"Species 2\" is even worse, often makes little sense. The one positive thing you can say is that does stay consistently entertaining. If you can't remember the plot of the first movie, here's what you need to know. Scientists received a transmission from outer space telling them how to splice human and alien DNA together. The resulting creature, a sexy lady with an incredible healing factor and superhuman strength had one goal in mind: breed and have her children replace humanity as the dominant. The creature managed to escape, kill a bunch of people and seduce more than a few lucky guys but her luck ran out when an under-qualified team of scientists managed to track her down and incinerate her. The movie ended with a cliffhanger, a deadly alien-rat hybrid managed to escape! Two years later, that rat died off or decided to take a vacation or something because we never see it again. Instead we tune in to witness man's first steps on Mars. A sample from the red planet contains an unseen threat though, living alien DNA! It merges with the three astronauts on board of the shuttle without their knowledge. The mission safely lands back on Earth but the head astronaut begins acting strangely. Once out of his father's sight (James Cromwell plays Senator Ross), Patrick Ross (Justin Lazard) has sex with two women (sisters who share everything) and they immediately give birth to more rapidly-growing human-alien hybrids. It's like the first movie, but this time it's a guy going around seducing and impregnating women with his alien DNA. It's time to call in the experts who survived the last movie to track down this menace. They are assisted by a clone of the creature from the first movie who shares a psychic link with Patrick. With the rapidly-growing spawns of the creature, a PR nightmare waiting to happen and a growing connection between the two hybrids, there's plenty on our heroes' plate so does humanity stand a chance against this new species?\n\nWhere do I begin with this movie? Obviously the appeal of the first movie was that it was kind of a worst-nightmare scenario for guys horror/thriller. There's a reason that sexy lady is interested in you buster, it's because she wants to give birth to the death of mankind! Use a condom, Earth could depend on it! You get the idea. It was bad, but it had some fun moments. This time, it's a male alien so the stakes are higher up. Not only is he able to go around impregnating woman after woman, but if you give birth to one of these hybrids, you're dead. On the upside, this means that if you thought seeing a naked woman was nice, but you got tired of seeing the same pair of breasts over and over, this time we get a whole parade of different women. The downside is that we get one awkward rape attempt and a plot that really makes no sense at times. So this astronaut that's going around seducing women left and right, but he's a famous astronaut; the first man on Mars. We even see that he's got his face plastered all over children's cereal! Why do people only recognize him when it's convenient to the plot? Why don't they tell the police and the civilian populace to keep an eye out for him? We're told that it's because it would be a public relations nightmare, but come on, wouldn't the fact that he leaves behind a trail of disemboweled women kind of require at least a police investigation or a press conference? When the entire population of the world is at stake, does it really matter what the reputation of one possessed man means?\n\nAs a sequel to the first film, this one isn't really that consistent with the previously established mythology. During the conclusion of \"Species\", Syl gave birth to a son, pretty much the same way a human would.  This time though, whenever somebody gives birth, it's a real horror show! Tentacles start grabbing people's faces, women's stomachs are exploding, there's blood everywhere... no one's safe! It's hard to tell if some of the events are intentionally nonsensical or just errors. Like a scene where some of Ross' blood grows a mind of its own and kills a scientist. It appears to crawl inside the wall and create a tentacle capable of punching through a grown adult's chest in the matter of seconds... and yet no one manages to be able to connect the dead body and the blood sample he was studying as a cause for these events. I'm pretty sure that beaker was labeled and you would be able to read what was marked on it even though it fell to the ground and shattered. Like in the previous film, the ridiculously important mission gets trusted to just a couple of guys. There's a scene where a helicopter is in pursuit of a hybrid. This is complete panic; this could be the one chance to nail the creature! Somehow though, it reaches its hideout and our heroes, who are driving arrive there long before anyone else... including the helicopter!\n\nThere are some cool special effects, particularly when we see the aliens in their natural forms but other times, it's really amateurish. There's a scene where Eve, the new female hybrid is being shot at by soldiers. She falls down, all bloody. Blood starts to leak out of her wounds when suddenly, it starts going back inside her again as she recovers from her injuries. Thanks to her alien powers she gets back up but her clothes are no longer bloody. That's because the footage of her healing is the same footage we saw a second ago, played backwards! What a joke. Next shot, her clothes are bloody again, but no bullet holes. It's embarrassing to watch. Here's another bad scene: Ross has grabbed a woman at the supermarket for the purposes of sex. Apparently his alien brain is really stupid because she was flirting with him right before he forcibly grabbed her and she started screaming. He obviously has a lot of charisma because he's been able to pick up ladies left and right up to now but this time, he's got no time to wait. Unfortunately for the victim, no one in the supermarket or the parking lot is paying attention and tries to intervene. There's hope though because our heroes are right behind them. We see the creature throw the nice lady into the back of a black van (this is the awkward rape attempt I was talking about). Our heroes walk into the parking lot and they see an identical black van rocking and when they open the door, what do they see? A normal human couple trying to get it on. You're telling me there was an identical black van, with another couple attempting to have sex in the exact same parking lot? Give me a break.\n\nThe first movie you can enjoy as a sleazy guilty pleasure but \"Species 2\" is just a bad science fiction horror film. It's not particularly scary or sexy and is often downright ridiculous. It's so bad it made me rethink my affections for the first film. Just skip this one.

His performance was ok, except as we learned from Species, he cant deliver one-liners. But he gave a good enough performance, as did Mykelti Williamson and Peter Boyle, but none of them drew any strength from the screenplay.\nNatasha Henstridge is given little dialogue or chances to prove herself as an actress or even an alien, and she was ok in some parts and her facial gestures gave her some strength, but since she didn't take her clothes off much then she didn't really provide a character that had much importance in the film. I guess you can't blame her though, because then she doesn't have to be second best to her breasts for the duration of the film like in Species.\nSpecies also has poor editing and bad lighting, so in the climactic alien sex scene it seems that nobody knows what's going on. There's also moments unexplained, like why Madsen had to stab Williamson in the leg with a pitchfork and use his blood to kill the alien.\nThere's also tedious use of slow motion at the more impacting scenes and the climax is over way too quickly, so Species 2 doesn't run for too long but could have used a few more minutes of action\n\nHowever, it is much less repetitive than it's predecessor and does introduce some decent new ideas to the series. It also has good, albeit occasionally weak cinematography and a strong musical score. \nSpecies 2 also utilises a good amount of gore and nudity as it knows that it's what the audience is hoping for. There was also some decent visual effects.\n\nSo in the end, Species 2 exceeds the expectations set by Species and i feel it's an improvement, but it isn't hard to improve over Species, so there's little to get excited about.",

This is an impressive sequel that though is far from perfect, has enough momentum to entertain the viewer. This film has enough gore elements to overshadow the paper thin plot, and works. The film is pure popcorn sci fi horror, and though not memorable by any means, this film, this film is nonetheless a worthy film to watch compared to the final two sequels that would follow this film. The acting here is decent at best, nothing ever great, or remarkable. The plot is so-so, and doesn't do anything to blow you away. However what this sequel does is deliver good gore content, and it does it very well. The film plays out like a mindless sci fi horror action film, and it doesn't possess anything truly remarkable about it. Overall this is a fun film that should appeal to fans of alien, monster films. If you can excuse the paper thin plot, you'll most likely enjoy the film. Fans of the first film will most likely enjoy this one as much as the first.

            "content": "SPECIES 2[1997]: It's a sure fact in Hollywood that 60% of all Sequels are never as good as the original. However only 40% of all sequels are often on par if not better than their predecessors and those films are the likes of THE GODFATHER PART 2, THE DARK KNIGHT, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, TERMINATOR 2 and ALIENS. But those films are a few examples of GOOD sequels, if you want an example a dirt average sequel that was spawned off the back of an otherwise average film then look no tougher than SPECIES 2. \r\n\r\n\r\nBut don't take my bias word for it here is an extract from the 2004 interview for the UK website METRO by the film's star Michael Madsen.\r\n\r\n \r\n\"METRO: On your website you rate your own films, and have some negative things to say about lots of them - including SPECIES 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nMASDEN: That's because SPECIES 2 was a crock of shit. There are a number I'm not very proud of. The movie studios can't mind that much, as they haven't contacted me to tell me off about it. I'm honest - if I've made a bad movie, I want my fans to know what they're letting themselves in for.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETRO: You're quoted as saying you've only made five good movies in your career. True?\r\n\r\n\r\nMASDEN: Pretty much. It's certainly less than ten. KILL BILL, SPECIES, FREE WILLY, THELMA AND LOUISE, RESERVOIR DOGS and DONNY BRASCO. Six, that's it, that's not a low number. I'm just hard to please. I've made some crap but you've got to pay the bills.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSource: http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/interviews/1020-michael-madsen#ixzz1LtlGI68M\r\n\r\nThat's right Madsen views SPECIES 2 as \"a crock of shit\" wow how many stars would be that honest? Well then again John Wayne regretted his 1956 dud THE CONQUEROR for being well just bad. So after viewing that average fest of the first SPECIES film let's dive right into the film that the critics, RT and Michael Madsen loathe and MGM doesn't care about it (like most of the trash in their vaults from AIP) the wonderful SPECIES 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAY 2 SPECIES 2 [1997]: After the first film in this four day marathon review series of series I now come to the second film and the last theatrical release film in the SPECIES series. And judging by my rating it's quite clear I didn't enjoy this film right dear reader? Yeah kind of, sure a rating of 50% indicates I found the film to be well not that good. Sure the first film isn't anything special but at least there wasn't such a serious undertone to that unlike this film trying to take the whole idea that a 2-demisonal nymphomaniac driven alien-woman IS something serious. The first film seemed a piece of B-grade sleazy Sic-Fi fun but SPECIES 2 takes itself and its material WAY too seriously in a half-assed Melodramatic way. It's no wonder why Madsen hates this movie so much. \r\n\r\n\r\nBut for what it's worth SPECIES 2 recycles the same lurid plotline with more absurd stuff and blended together with double amounts of female nudity, sex, and gore. But is it enjoyable as the first film? God no it's a step down which can describe the pre -mentioned 60% of all Movie Sequels. The reason why I find this film to be well a step down is due to the serious attitude of the film and its slightly annoying nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLOTLINE \r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Astronaut Patrick Ross and his crew mates Dennis and Anna have a successful voyage to Mars take samples of the Martian soil. But on the way home a gooey substance (sadly not THE BLOB) leaks out of the containers and attaches on the crew. Back on Earth Patrick Ross is hailed as a hero and since he is part Alien now mindless sex with women that explode after being impregnated ensures. Now with one of the crew of the Mars mission staring up a new Alien species, the military now called upon the help of a caged female clone of Sil called Eve( played by Natasha Henstridge), her Doctor and again called upon Press Lenox (Madsen) to track down Ross. But when the Doctor awakens the alien cells in Eve she now escapes from the lab and now wants to have freaky Alien sex with Ross. \r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACTING, SCRIPTING, DIRECTION, AND CINEMA PHOTOGRAPHY \r\n\r\nWhat can I say about the performances in this film? Natasha Henstridge as Eve unlike her previous performance as the 2D Sil is given emotions to try and display in this role. The character of Eve is written to be a tiny bit more 3-demisnonal considering her imprisonment and growing weary of viewing the world through the T.V. But thanks to Henstridge painfully wooden acting and this films over the top seriousness her acting comes across as flat as a flat soft-drink. Madsen who in hindsight dearly regrets being involved in this sequel is one of the saving graces as a repeat performance as Press Lenox but hang on isn't his name Preston? A bit of a continuity laps don't you think? Let's just say Madsen is ok in an otherwise lame film. But one of the more comical minor characters is the insane doctor played by the EVERYONE LOVES RAYMOND stars Peter Boyle (who played Ray's father Frank) gives an over the top performance. For me the sign of a good acting is one actor or actress who could throw themselves into their role but here it becomes comical that Boyle when over the top with such a lame role. In fact seeing more of his bizarre character might have been a bit more enjoyable than the odd mix of the soft-core sex scenes with the sudden gore scenes.\r\n\r\n \r\nAs far as the scripting goes it just seems tacky thrown with this film's director obsession to makes a silly film seem WAY too serious. Although the first film was guilty of doing that at least it didn't go overboard with shitty melodrama unlike this film. And more irritating is how stereotypical the black character is, first we see the character of Dennis on the Mars mission  coming across as a serious person but back on earth he becomes the source of the comical relief by wanting to get laid in a typical look-he's-black-funny-and-cool -Wayans Brother manner. The rest like the cinema photography is well uninspired so to cut a LONG story short that's all I can say with the highly forgettable SPECIES 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall Thoughts\r\n\r\nTo cut a long story short I hated it, sure it was mildly amusing but with this films serious nature and god awful characterization of this films Black hero is just near irritating.  So why not give a rating lower 50%? Well after seeing utter schlock like THE SEX KILLER, WOODCHIPPER MASSACRE, MONSTER A GO-GO and SANTA AND THE ICE CREAM BUNNY  just to name but a few. My standards for a BAD movie are VERY low. To me this film is a below average Sic-Fi sequel that blends elements of various Sic-Fi films both good and bad in one lame package that even the film's star hates it so. Then again if SPECIES 2 was lame how bad can SPECIES 3 be? Oh well two down and now two to go in this 4 day review marathon, the rating for SPECIES 2 is a weak 50%.",
