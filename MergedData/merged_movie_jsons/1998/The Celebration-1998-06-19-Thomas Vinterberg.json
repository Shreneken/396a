            "content": "I have seen this film more than I've bothered to keep track of. That's not to say that I've seen it an unusual amount of times(it's probably not more than three), just that I've never bothered to keep track. Anyway, my point is, every time, it's like seeing it for the first time. I keep discovering things that I must have noticed before, but don't remember seeing earlier. Tonight, I finally realized why; I'm blocking them out. I'm blocking out almost every single second of this film, and here's why; it reminds me of everything I hate about Denmark and being Danish. Everything strangers automatically associate me with, because I'm Danish. Not only does it remind me of it, the film flaunts it, without ever even considering holding back. The way we drink, how superficial we are, how dependent the typical grown male is of women, how racist and ignorant we are... everything. The film effectively airs our dirty laundry to the audience. On this latest viewing, I actually couldn't stand sitting through(a self-contradiction, I know) more than the first half hour... after which I casually followed the rest whilst sitting at my computer, from where I can see the TV screen... when I bother to stretch, so the computer monitor isn't blocking the view. Needless to say, I didn't catch an awful lot of it this way... but what I got was more than enough to disgust me. I can't think of any other movie I have this kind of relationship with... and I know why. I also know why this film has such an impact on me. It's because it's real. True. This is the kind of stuff you don't find in fiction... but in the newspaper, in your own family, in your own people, wherever you're from... the ugly side of us all. The shadow side. What we keep hidden from the outside world, but what we ultimately succumb to if we don't indulge it every once in a while. I chose to center my review for this film around this, because I think it's what really stands out about it. Also, I think we all, by now, know how great the acting, writing and direction is. And, being a Dogme film, it's very creatively filmed, too. So there you have it. A very creative film that puts so much focus on the shadow side of us all, of Danes in particular that is so effective that it actually makes me sick, me, a person who's been watching violent movies since I was twelve and was hardly ever affected by it. I recommend this to anyone who believe they can take it. Definitely not for the faint of heart or very sensitive people. Most people will probably have as strong a negative reaction to this as I did(unless they're far more grounded and at peace with who they are than I am), but don't let that deter you from seeing it. Chances are, you'll love it. If nothing else, you can't claim that it was fake or untrue. 10/10",

This is brilliant in its own right as a 'family' drama. I was hooked from 20 minutes in.

            "content": "First of all, the home video camera style, casting and editing perfectly suited the subject matter and script.  Wealthy and overbearing patriarch is feted on the occasion of his 60th birthday -- extended family and hangers-on gather with some of the best and worst aspects of our culture on display. It's also a rather sad occasion, as one of daddy's daughters killed herself not long ago, but several guests mention how \"nice\" the funeral was, and which room is mine?  Eldest son rises to give a toast to the old man -- and out comes some unpleasantness that people would either prefer to pretend they didn't hear, or stuff forcefully back down his throat.  Then the fun really starts.Thanks to the cast for acting with restraint -- and being believable.Some very black humour (including pathetic scenes of the decadent bourgeoisie at play), none of it gratuitous, some of it damning, some just outrageously funny.  But this is not a light film in any sense.  Guess what really happens when the victimised family member tells the truth?  Ouch! What about when mommy gets to choose between husband and child?  Double ouch!!  And finally, when victim asks dad why he did it -- well, prepare for the blow to the old solar plexus...Trust me, I know.  This is how it really happens.  It's good to see a well-crafted film (that gives its human themes paramount importance) on this subject.  I'm tired of watching films which try to make me feel sorry for rich kids whose parents just don't understand how hard it is to be a rich kid with pimples.As the families (one in ten?) with histories like this one can attest, being \"dysfunctional\" would have been a very happy place to be, compared to the reality as shown in this fine film.",

            "content": "This surprise success based on an uncomfortable subject has become an essential reference adapted for theater in many countries. The film immediately gives the impression of having been filmed with a dysfunctional iPhone of the 70s suffering from a perfectible autofocus. This is certainly the expression of Dogme 95, a manifesto of a strong desire of the directors Thomas Vinterberg and Lars von Trier to move away from a cinematographic world they consider too licked, too clean, too artificial, returning to a sobriety more expressive, more original, more formal, with an excessive despoilment of any aesthetic ambition. This impression will last until the last minute. After this rather negative observation, the film is excellent: between the dialogues, the acting and the unfolding of the story, it keeps you out of breath and you will wait for the epilogue with an unbearable impatience. A must see!",

            "content": "Vinterberg's \"Festen\" which follows the strict guidelines of Dogma 95 could perhaps be hampered in its artistic approach, but not so here.  Indeed with the hand-held camera the reality of the scene is intensified to such an extent one feels an integral part of the drama.It's a family celebration of father Helge's 60th birthday.  It's strange though that all the guests seem to arrive at the same time, speeding up the driveway in great excitement. There is lots of noise. hugs and kisses and the camera intruding in a mischievous way.This family has some terrible dark secrets known to some, not to all.  They are divulged by the eldest son Christian (Ulrich Thomson) in his dinner speech toasting his father. This is a wonderful scene, tense, sharp, riveting.  The guests are shaken to the core.  Is he telling the truth or is he having a wicked game with the assembled company? It's great stuff - really compelling drama.The history of the family can be pieced together from information revealed in a series of toasts, but Christian's contribution renders the party speechless.  It's a fairly noisy film with lots of people talking together, having arguments (Christian's brother Michael {Thomas Bo}     has an uncontrollable temper) or screaming in frustration.  These out bursts contrast so well with the scenes of stunned silence.  They are quite electrifying moments - no words are necessary.Films like this one make movie-watching well worthwhile.  No wonder it won a Jury Prize.",

            "content": "\"Festen\" aka \"The Celebration\" was the impressive directorial debut of the young Danish filmmaker Thomas Vinterberg (\"It's All About Love\", \"Dear Wendy\"), and the first film made according to the rules of the daring Dogme 95 movement. It shows that you don't need big budgets to make a great film. However, Dogme wouldn't work if its films weren't as daring as its ideals of film-making - and \"Festen\" proved that those guys really have much to say.\"Festen\" is an extremely cruel film, and it's somewhat uneasy to watch in some moments. The celebration of the title refers to the 60th birthday of Helge Klingenfeldt-Hansen (Henning Moritzen), who entertains his big family in his castle. But Helge's son, Christian (Ulrich Thomsen, excellent), whose twin sister recently committed suicide, has an important revelation that will surprise - and displease - many people; in the meantime, other secrets are revealed and nobody will get away clean. \"Festen\" deserved all praise/awards it got in international festivals (it won the Jury Prize at Cannes 98) and is a great introduction to Danish cinema. My vote is 10/10.",

And, as most of the European movies, in less than 3 weeks, it wasn't...\nOK, you'll tell the truth: I don't know why but I didn't watch it on a theater, and I could have done it. I waited for its release in video but all the times I went to the videostore I forgot to rent it. But one year after the release on theaters, it was rolling in Eurochannel (a cable-TV channel. It's all about Europe). I couldn't miss that chance so, on a Friday night, at 22:00, I finally watched it. And what an AMAZING film!!!At first, the plot seems interesting and simple but after 20 minutes you finally realize how strong and provocative Festen really is. It's about one celebration made by the patriarch of the family Kingenfelt in the hotel where he lives. He's commemorating his 60 years. Christian, the older son, makes a speech where secrets are revealed. The rules of the Dogme 95 as the use of natural light, camera in the hands, etc, help to create a claustrophobic and confidential clime, like nobody knows that someone is filming them. The scenes look incredibly real. Paprika Steen (Helene) and Ulrich Thomsen (Christian) were more than extraordinary. Paprika is a great actress and I can't stand waiting to watch \"Idiotern\", the second Dogme, in which she's acting again.\"Festen\" is not just a worth watching film. It's a worth watching, re-watching, watching again, renting many times and recording to watch it a hundred times.  Being the first Dogme, it's a mark in the cinema's history.\nGrade - A+",

This is a movie about, among other things, the power of social conventions, how we depend on them to deal with unpleasantness, and just how stubborn and difficult they can be to circumvent, even when your life depends on it. What knocks me out is how much I'm convinced by the whole thing. Every sad detail makes perfect sense. There is so much wisdom here that it never overreaches, no matter how deep in the storytellers get. In particular, the medium of digital video is used in an outstanding way that adds authenticity to the experience. Think about it- most of the hand-held video work we've seen is of our own family events. When we watch the only scene in which Christian weeps, with Gbatokai leaning over and giving moral support, it could almost pass for a candid moment in a homemade documentary.I've seen a lot of good family dramas, but rarely have I had such an urge to hug the main character and unleash profanity at several of the others.",

A wealthy Danish man is celebrated by friends and family at his manor for his 60th birthday, an event clouded by the recent suicide of one of his daughters. What starts off as light satire of the affluent, heightened by the home-movie-like realism that director Thomas Vinterberg got out of using handheld cameras, soon segues to much darker areas. It's a mesmerizing mix of comedy and pathos, and engaging throughout.I won't spoil it, but there is lots of incredibly bad behavior, some overt and stemming from how entitled these people are, and some complicit, protecting their insular world. Nothing shows just how much they are willing to sweep things under the rug than when some of the truths about the past come out, and one of the sons is aggressively taken out into the woods. Nothing shows just how bigoted the group is than when one of the other sons starts singing a racist song to antagonize a black guest (the man his sister is dating) and everyone happily joins in. The father saying the line \"that's all you were good for\" was like a knife to the heart, and the subtlety of the son's reaction (Ulrich Thomsen) is heartbreaking. The unique style of the film and moments like this make it memorable, and it's worth seeking out.",

            "review_title": "A barbecue for Danish family values",
            "content": "Having read about the film makers' \"Dogme 95\" charter I was expecting something pretty bizarre here but \"Festen\" (festival, celebration) co-written and directed by Thomas Vinterberg turned out to be the fairly orthodox tale of a traumatic family reunion. The only oddball feature, which added nothing to the dramatic impact, was the deliberately coarse film quality, achieved, it seems, by using a digital video camera. Perhaps \"no artistic egos were destroyed in the making of this film\" but the impression I got was that somebody competent was in charge, albeit somebody with a taste for odd camera angles.The story centres around Christian, who travels back to the family country hotel (in Denmark) from his successful Paris restaurant to celebrate his father's 60th birthday. We soon discover the family are a pretty gross lot. There's a nymphomaniac sister, a violent, overbearing younger brother, and a twin sister who has committed suicide. Father is a burly dirty-minded bully with a short fuse \"protected\" by his elegant but cowed wife. Naturally a family like this has enough dirty linen to fill the hotel laundry which they proceed to reveal in the course of the evening in front of twenty or thirty guests, who, just in case they were thinking of leaving, have had their car keys hidden from them. Complicit in all of this are the long-suffering hotel staff, who can't see it happening to a more deserving bunch of people.It's a bit difficult to say much about the acting - not understanding Danish is a bit of a barrier- let alone Danish mores. Christian (Ulrich Thomsen) is played as the still centre - we find out about him from what others say- yet he holds our attention throughout. Thomas Bo Larsen as Michael the obnoxious younger brother puts in a full-blooded manic performance and Paprika Steen as their sister Helena gave her role plenty of depth. The father (Henning Moritzen) was a bit two-dimensional - not enough charm to offset his basic nastiness. Among the minor players, I particularly liked Lars Brygman as Lars, the reception clerk, who never loses his (somewhat stunned) composure even as he is lying fully clothed in a bathtub at the behest of Helena looking for ghosts in the ceiling. I also liked Helmuth (Klaus Bondam), the Danish idea of the comic German toastmaster, who after some particularly shocking revelations at the dinner table manages to suggest dessert, coffee and dancing in the lounge - and the stunned guests meekly comply.There were hints of Bunuel in this movie (\"there's nothing charming about the bourgeiose\") and perhaps \"Last Year in Marienbad.\" The spirit of Ingmar Bergman was not far away either. The hotel itself, near Stockholm, according to the rather wavery credits, had a pretentious overstuffed, claustrophobic atmosphere that seemed quite appropriate.Well. I don't know if Dogme 95 has anything new to say about film-making, but this was a watchable story. I think, however, anyone coming from a family like that would avoid reunions at all costs, even if seeking revenge.",

            "review_title": "A different kind of film",
            "content": "The first film following the Dogme-rules is Thomas Vinterberg's 'Festen'. He and famous director Lars von Trier, who's 'Idioterne' is the second Dogme-film, want to attack the \"auteurs theory\" that claims that only one person, the director, is really responsible for the finished product. Vinterberg and Von Trier try to show that this does not make any sense. In a way they show us, but while doing that they also create a certain style that seems to distinguish their work, especially Von Trier's, making it really the work of a certain director. Therefore it also proves the auteur theory is true in a way.Back to 'Festen', not only the first but arguably the best from the Dogme-films. It tells the story of a family coming together for the 60th birthday of Helge (Henning Moritzen). We learn to know other members of the family. We also learn one of his daughters, part of twins, recently killed herself. Then, at dinner, the oldest son and other part of twins Christian (Ulrich Thomsen), announces he and his sister were sexually abused by their father. At first people think it is a bad joke but do not really respond, but when he announces the same thing again the guests do not think it is funny anymore. Especially the other son Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen), an aggressive man with apparently not a pleasant passed, gets really mad trying to keep Christian away from the party. How this develops is for you to see.The story is interesting and almost unbelievable at the same time. I was pretty surprised at times. The material is pretty heavy and the style, according to Dogme-regulation, adds to that atmosphere. Since the camera is always moving, it is hand-held, and since no filters and artificial light are used the film gets a raw and gritty look. Those effects seem to tell a viewer things are not as they should. It works the same way for Von Trier's heavy material in 'Breaking the Waves' and 'Dancer in the Dark'. What also works for 'Festen' are the performances. I almost would not call them performances, it really feels like your watching a home video made by one of the guests, recording events of real people.'Festen' is different from other films, in a good way that is.",

Since I had similar childhood experiences, I only care about the story, and to me this is definitely the best movie dealing with the subject of incest I have seen yet. I was suffering with Christian when he finally opened up to his family. It was very moving to see him struggling desperately to make them listen to him despite their violent resistance. And it was a very good feeling to see him succeed in the end. All in all I saw a very touching movie with lots of overwhelming emotions for me.\nThis movie is special because it shows that the suffering does not end when the children grow up and leave home. And it shows why it is so hard for victims to talk about their experiences by expressing one of their biggest (and unfortunately very realistic) fears: That noone will believe them, and that even their family will refuse to listen to them because they don\u00b4t want their illusion of a happy family to be destroyed.",

            "content": "A different and interesting movie with some important message delivery.After witnessing what Thomas Vinterberg has done in the Hunt (2012), a masterpiece of Danish cinema, I had to check out other works that he had made, which took me back all the way to 1998 and to Festen, a recent directorial debut for the young Thomas. Although it discusses the same topic as the Hunt, it has a very unique a different approach to it.In Festen we witness a rich family dinner in Denmark, and we see the spiral towards some dark discoveries as the hours go by. What seems to be in the beginning another typical eccentric rich family gathering, becomes an uncomfortable reunion where some very serious matters are brought to the table.The message the movie conveys is daunting and yet I find it highly relevant, we as a society, specially in big gatherings and reunions, have a standard set of rules of politeness that we follow and one would be considered rude or an actual outcast if he /she wouldn't abide by those rules, in Festen this is taken to the extreme (or maybe not), and it criticizes how those standards we follow, cause sometimes for us to awkwardly ignore major issues that can be unfolding right in front of our eyes, and we choose the superficial approach.Now it would be legitimate to ask why I haven't given a much higher score then? Well for starters, I've read some previews reviews, including some from Danish people, who claim that this exposes a real issue with special importance in their society given how superficial they are, I cannot of course speak for this as I 'm not Danish so although the message is critical, it doesn't touch me probably as it does to Denmark nationals if this represents the truth.Adding to that, and although I do believe that Thomas is an amazing director and this was an innovative approach, I am not a fan of the camera work and the perspective that we look into the film, a lot of people argue that it brings some realism, almost resembling an amateur camera filming the events, but for me it didn't quite work and it brought some odd feeling while watching it, for me it had the reverse effect, it didn't seem real, I still believe it's a great film regardless and definitely worth watching, if the same message was conveyed in a different manner this would be a 10/10.",

It's the right approach, all things considered; if this were done as a 'normal' film, the acting certainly would carry it, but by everything being either hand-held in its pre-historic digital video, or in a distorted perspective (no tri-pods were used, to my understanding), there's an energy to it that can't be touched. There's real manic, nervous, anxious energy to the whole piece, even when it's just two characters sitting down to talk, like early on when Christian, sort of the main character in this ensemble, is listening to his dad (or step-dad I guess) telling him something important before festivities begin (or the one who really kicks off the central conflict - that being the one being celebrated for his 60th birthday, good old dad).It's not really important; not like, say, the bombshell that Christian drops almost carefree during his toast at this big familial engagement at this country hous, or the fact that this is taking place just days after the death of his sister by suicide. Meanwhile, other characters are dealing with things, like the volatile, abusive f*** of a brother Michael, and the other sister who is just trying to keep it together but can't understand, barely, how a party can go on like this in the first place.Tension ripples through this whole film. I can imagine, or just see, someone watching this and being put off by it. It's reckless, sloppy filmmaking in a big way - camera-work at times is jumbled and all over the place, and angles seem to jut-out with large letters. One would see this again in the couple of times Lars von Trier tried this (even Dancer in the Dark had the feel). But this is successful so much because the style is approximate, and even tries to keep up, with the emotional stakes. These characters are frayed and at best awkward with the revelations being tossed about, and some side things like, say, one of the characters bringing to the party a black taxi driver. When the party guests, led by obnoxious Michael (that actor, Thomas Bo Larsen, is incredible here by the way, if almost, probably over the top), sing a racist song at the table, with the man at right there. Yes, they're pretty much all horrible, folks! This shouldn't be funny as it is. Often, it's shocking and provocative, and is like if one took The Rules of the Game or Exterminating Angel (the latter I'm reminded of due to a moment or two where it seems like no one will be able to leave the house) and the filmmakers strip it all down until the bare, raw nerve endings are standing up, and characters puncture them one by one. There are times where it's funny just because of the tension in the room - it's not funny as in there's a punch-line, more like you need to laugh for just the relief from the nasty feelings. Other times, you can't laugh because of just how disturbing things get, like when a letter is discovered and read out loud. That scene in particular may be the best in the film: everything grinds to a halt when the truth fully, without any doubt, comes to light.It's incredible work because there's little room for subtlety here. If you're looking for BIG, this is big work, and yet on a very low-budget, super independent scale. Just as the camera-work is being performed sort of like a high-wire act, the family and friends at this gathering are on a similar edge as well, always ready to fall over with the threat (and visible appearance) of chaos and violence. Maybe in the days of Cassavetes this sort of filmmaking was possible, though even then he had tri-pods and artificial light. And because everything feels real, and real-time for the most part, it's hard not to get caught up into the action and these character's problems - even when you know you can't be on their side, or find them much sympathetic. The Celebration is cinema on fire.",

            "content": "This is not the most disturbing film I've ever seen but it ranks right up there, both for the subject matter and the filming style of the cinematographer. I think the point of the jarring jumps and distorted filming angles lends credence to the emotional story of a dysfunctional family coming to terms with events in the past that threaten to bring it down disgracefully. What surprised me was how none of the extended family seemed to be upset by the purported abuse revealed by Christian (Ulrich Thomsen) at his father's sixtieth birthday celebration. You would think some of them would be repulsed, if not by the revelations, then by the sheer insanity of the immediate family in dealing with each other. I mean really, how do you recover from Christian's opening remarks to the gathered guests - \"Here's to the man who killed my sister..., a murderer.\" Talk about being a party pooper.A couple of curiosities in the story. First, Christian's request to his father to select the green or the yellow note. Since it seemed Christian was resolved to deliver the shocking news in any event, my own reaction is that he would have given the same speech either way. Then there was the mysterious posture of the head kitchen chef Kim (Bjarne Henriksen). I felt he was in league with Christian to some extent, but nothing he personally did in the story really bore that out, unless you want to consider his involvement in hiding everyone's keys so they couldn't beat a hasty retreat. To a certain degree, I also thought the waitress staff knew about the Klingenfeldt dirty laundry, and wouldn't be too upset if the truth came out.Aside from the father Helge (Henning Moritzen), the most despicable character here was Christian's brother Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen), who seemed to treat anyone in his orbit with equal disdain and contempt. His forced relations with wife Mette (Helle Dolleris) bordered on violent rape, and in that regard, I had to consider that even if he had been away at college during his father's abusive period with Christian and sister Linda, the suicide victim, his aggression appeared to mask his own abusive past by a father who didn't give much of a damn. It's no wonder that sister Helene (Paprika Steen) gave voice to all of those fears and resentments by stating at one point - \"They've always been ghosts in this house.\"",

It is a powerful, immaculately acted and performed and photographed study on the level of the great Greek dramas, but placed oh so uncomfortably in modern times.Helge Klingenfeldt-Hansen (Henning Moritzen) is the patriarch of a large family whose 60th birthday is cause for a huge celebration, a party in the wake of the latest subterranean dark secret of this ominous group - the suicide death of the eldest sister (Lene Laub Oksen - seen only as a spirit), twin of Christian (Ulrich Thomsen). Christian returns to the party from his successful Parisian restaurant career bringing with him his history of multiple institutionalizations for 'mental illness'. He is joined by his brother Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen), a ne're do well owner of a sleazy grill in Copenhagen and married to Mette (Helle Dolleris) in a 'challenging' domestic life (!), and his lawyer sister Helene (Paprika Steen) who quite against family rules is living with a black man Gbatokai (Gbatokai Dakinah). The only calm one among this disparate group is the mother (Birthe Neumann).Problems arise before the party begins, old sibling differences and family squabbles rising out of the cracks in the glorious old castle that houses the celebration. But the clinker comes when Helge asks Christian to offer words at the feast, a task openly welcomed as it gives Christian the opportunity to flail out the truth about the Helge that everyone seems to admire but who in fact is the nidus for the dark submerged evils that permeate the family. In the course of the celebration all of the family problems are revealed in a manner that is as stunning as the blackest of Greek tragedies.The cast is extraordinary: every actor is gifted and performs difficult roles to perfection. Outstanding among them are Ulrich Thomsen and Paprika Steen who give notice of great acting talents. Much has been said about the manner in which the film was made according to Danish codes: suffice it to say the code's rules magnify the importance of this wholly successful film.

His children he has not seen for a long time start to arrive, along with other relatives. The first one we see is Christian, his eldest son, a quiet but troubled man. He is walking down a desolate road on his way to the house, and is passed by a car with his younger brother Michael, his wife, and three children in it. The car stops and they greet each other, then Michael throws his wife and kids out and tells them to walk the rest of the way. This is our first glimpse at Michael's crudeness. He turns out to be a bigoted ruffian. The other main character is their sister Helene, who has a coloured boyfriend. This causes problems later when he arrives, and he is racially insulted by Michael, who also conducts a racist song by all the guests. There is always a troubling menace underneath the surface of this film. The scene where Christian gives his first speech sets the tone of the film, and leaves us to ponder. We also learn another sister committed suicide, and left a revealing note, which Helene reads out late in the film. It is always fascinating to watch. Very powerful stuff once again from the Dogme stable. It certainly has its unique and effective style, and always keeps the viewer watching. Superb film making.",

At first, the movie seemed rather ordinary--lots of family and friends arriving at a small family-owned hotel to celebrate the 60th birthday of the patriarch. Everything seems quite normal except for two things--a daughter in the family recently died and you're unsure what exactly happened to her AND one of the two brothers you meet is a jerk (pushy and nasty to say the least). The other brother is the pride of the family and he has been called upon to deliver a speech at the festive dinner later in the evening. When he rises, he asks his father WHICH of the written speeches he's brought should he read--the one in the left hand or the one in the right. From here, all hell breaks loose and the viewer is taken into the darkest recesses of a very sick and disturbed family abounding in secrets. The characters ring very true--the bully brother, the other brother dying to reveal the family secrets, the father and mother steeped in denial. What an amazing movie.PS--This film is NOT appropriate for children. Use common sense if you choose to allow your teen to watch. I think it's appropriate to show them but the subject matter is very graphic and may need to be discussed with your child after you watch the movie.PPS--Although this movie was part of the so-called \"Dogma95\" movement (calling for a simpler and purer type film free of \"Bourgeoise\" content), I could care less about such labels and the whole anti-\"Bourgeoise\" thing sounds like a lot of pseudo-intellectual nonsense. The movie was wonderful--that is what's is important. MIFUNE was another \"Dogma95\" film and I hated it. This is the same argument I have when I watch the \"French New Wave\" films. To those who are disciples of this \"dogma\", they will not accept any criticism (though they themselves criticize everything else). I cannot embrace the films or reject them based on some stupid set of rules that the directors, producers and writers adhere to. The end product must stand on its own.

There are instants when a humbly gagged chuckle is induced and is then immediately smothered, as it dawns on us that a scene is not meant to be funny. Or vice versa.Vinterberg directs the script so dexterously that we're constantly compelled to probe for indications of the deliberate pitch. Yes, the plot and backstory are unpleasant and grim, yet some peripheral characters, and especially what they do, are out of classic slapstick. This is the inflection of The Celebration, a passage in an extensive generational epic.Vinterberg shot the film on video, then blew it up to 35-mm. film. He joined with Lars von Trier and two other Danish directors in endorsing a deed called Dogma 95, which was brought to light at Cannes and contracted them all to shoot on location, using only natural sounds and props found on such location, employing no special effects or music and working solely with hand-held cameras. It would be oppressive if demanded for the long haul, but the approach definitely works for this movie. A comparable technique is at the crux of John Cassavetes' films.It's a testament to this Danish cult favorite, a vivid depiction of denial and comeuppance, that genre and narrative don't lose balance between one another. The script is innately crafted, the actors are adept at displaying their feelings, and the drawn-out family outing's progress through to dusk is replete with anguish that the droll aspects indeed prolong. And then the denouement, and we can just jut our heads forward in amazement when we see the characters rambling back into the same room again.",

The character-playing, camera technique and use of light and shade, is unique, something quite apart from the run-of-the-mill fodder mass-fed to the undiscerning pop-corn squad. \"Festen\" has to be seen three or four times for you to be able to digest what is simply pure basic hardcore cinematography at its best: wonderfully executed by actors who put Kodak Theatre red-carpet walkers to shame.

I am quite all right with sitting through such, if in the end there is some value. That was not the case for me here. In the end I knew things about what happened to some of these people, but very little about why; I gained little understanding of the members of this family beyond the superficial.In \"The Woodsman,\" which was also a painful movie to watch, I felt that I came away with some understanding of one man's struggle with antisocial sexual compulsions and could even have some sympathy for him. But here, the only understanding we get about the father's molesting his son came from his comment to him, \"That's all you were good for.\" Can't we expect a bit more depth than that? Every few minutes there was some new disgusting act or revelation by the members of this family that made me wonder if any family could be so screwed up. With the group singing of a viciously racist song I realized that there were hardly any decent folks in the entire lot. What is the point of our eavesdropping on such a tawdry mess?I knew nothing about Dogme 95 before having seen this and looked it up afterward. This is the first official Dogme 95 film I have seen (I did see \"Breaking the Waves\" and liked it) and it may be the last. The rules laid out by Dogme 95 seem foolish to me. If you want to accomplish a certain effect, then why not use any tool at your disposal? Why impose some artificial restrictions on yourself? As Dogme 95 pertains to \"The Celebration,\" I found the washed out grainy color and hand held camera work annoying and distracting rather than involving. I felt that the story was contrived and unbelievable. For example, the only reason the breakfast scene was in there was so the patriarch could deliver his apology, and he showed no sign of having been beaten to a pulp the night before. If there was humor or satire here, it flew right over my head. \"The Celebration\" may be a cautionary tale for potential child molesters, but for me it was a pretentious downer with no redeeming value.",

Ironically, it's sometimes relatively easy to mistake a deeply dramatic scene for a comedic one. This is a sharp and somehow disturbing tragicomedy that reveals the transformative power of truth, showing how a seemingly ordinary birthday party can change into an acute contest filled with accusations and revelations. After a rough and intense night no one is left unharmed, and the characters subconsciously know that even before they start to delve into the past.A cultivated and wealthy patriarch Helge (Henning Moritzen) is having a huge, luxurious 60th birthday party, and the whole family is invited. In the group there are three of his children: Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen), a chronic and irascible boozer, Helene (Paprika Steen), an anxious and depressed anthropologist, and Christian (Henning Moritzen), a withdrawn and angry restaurateur, whose twin sister recently committed suicide, among other guests. Before the party even starts, the intimacy of the main characters is exposed, as they plunge deeper into the state of irrepressible existential angst with their peculiar pre-party 'preparations'. When the family gathers for a sit-down with the man of the night, a huge feasts begins and toasts are about to be made. As of then, nobody even expects that Christian is about the make a shocking Speech of Truth, one that will change the course of the whole evening, destroy the relations between the relatives, and ultimately cause a hell of a farce. By accusing his father of sexual abuse when he and his loving sister were little (additionally pointing out that his father is the true killer behind the sister's suicide), Christian only encourages others to expose their true feelings. What began as a celebration of one happy man's birthday turned into a violent, alcohol and hate-filled showcase of the most shocking kind. The gradual loss of innocence (though it's all right to assume that such a disturbing even took place before) is properly 'enriched' with a Dutch racist song, a few fights, a few bottles of wine, and a late-night dance that is supposed to smooth the whole repugnant situation. It's only surprising to observe as all the relatives eat breakfast the next morning in the exact same place, looking into each other's eyes without any apparent regret.Indisputably, The Celebration is Vinterberg's visionary approach to a family-in-shambles. As in every other Dogme 95 picture, the realism of the whole story is enhanced through on-location shooting, natural sounds, hand-held cameras, and no additional effects whatsoever. Even though it's hard no to laugh at times, the devastating power of this film is as harrowing as the main characters are cold-blooded and self-contained.",

It's called a funny satire in a reviewer's quote on the video box. I think he was just trying to be smart. Reviewers are prone to label as satire anything that falls outside their experience, and to demonstrate their coolness by laughing at what moves the groundlings. The situation, a family reunion that explodes the family, could easily be treated as comedy, and is in the first scenes, but for the rest of the film it's played straight, as far as one can see, and the characters' suffering seems intended seriously rather than ironically. If satire was the aim, the filmmakers chose a style ill suited to it, that jarring, repetitive, pseudo-photojournalistic style now commonplace in TV crime shows and soft-drink commercials. It can be used well; most often it's just irritating; but the impression of in-your-face immediacy that is its object is the opposite of the distance required by satire. Here, it does something else that put me off: it makes the film look like an American film. So do the younger actors, who play in the same Methody style as Americans; the black-sheep brother comes off like a Danish James Spader, only with more talent. They're still good actors, and I I believed their performances. But with this qualification: I believed what they were doing, but usually I didn't believe they'd be doing it. On American cop shows the pseudo-documentary style is often used to add verisimilitude to scenes that would seem false without it, and I felt it was being used to the same effect here. Most of the characters' lines, especially at the banquet table, I found unmotivated; that is, they had plenty of motivation in general but none to say that particular thing at that particular time. I found most of the reactions unlikely too. I kept finding myself asking Why? Why this? Why now?

            "review_title": "A continually gripping drama about families and their secrets and a masterpiece of 90's film",
            "content": "Ten years on and Festen (1998) remains a surprisingly radical piece of film-making; a work of daring drama that presents a story rich in the very basic need for intrigue and suspense, and tightly structured around a vast ensemble of characters brought together under the pretence of family. The film works because it is superbly written, impeccably performed and directed with a real, piercing scope of intelligence. However, the reason that the singular elements manage to come together and envelope us so successfully in a way that few films of recent years really do is down to the visual presentation of the text.Although Lars von Trier's The Idiots (1998) remains perhaps the most successful experiment in working within the confines of the Dogme 95 manifesto - with the limitations of conventional cinematic style used there to outwardly convey the search for inner purity and emotional simplification of the heartbroken central character - Festen's use of style works towards bringing the audience into the film, into the family; so that the darker, more mysterious elements of the script appeal more to our natural sense of curiosity and the voyeuristic nature that film, at its most basic level, presents. Had this film been shot more conventionally, with glossy 35mm colour stock, elaborate lighting and ornate production design the story, characters and performances would have still worked, but the overall sense of intimacy and painful emotional suffocation simply wouldn't have been so searing. The use of hand-held digital video, natural light, sloppy jump-cuts and lack of music create a sense of abstracted realism; tapping into images familiar from wedding videos or self-shot home-movie footage of birthdays, anniversaries, etc and making the audience almost a member of the proceedings (an innocent viewer, caught up in this painful family turmoil, or a co-conspirator, aware of every action the central character is about to make and implicit in his downfall).The scope of the story and the manner in which it is presented lends itself to this idea that what we are watching is somehow real; which offers the already engaging drama an uncomfortable feature that manages to question the very nature of what it is to be an audience. Of course, at the back of our minds we're still aware that what we're watching has been created; with the artifice of self-shot video being a deconstructive element in itself, especially when combined with the disintegration of the facade of film-making further created by the strict rules of the Dogme. However, once again, the technique works in favour of the drama, not against it; creating a film that is clever and satisfying on a self-reflexive level and also something that rewards and entertains as a piece of intelligent, character-based drama. Such notions are further underlined by the naturalistic performances from the talented cast, who forgo any ideas of ego in order to play these characters as close to the knuckle as they possibly can. It's pushed even further by the careful direction of Thomas Vinterberg, who has yet to produce a piece of work that comes anywhere near the effective brilliance and originality of the film in question.Although the influence of Dogme would wane somewhat within the next couple of years, being pronounced dead as early as 2002, the idea of removing all sense of obvious cinematic artifice in order push the emotional and psychological concerns of the story to the surface was an interesting one, and something that clearly worked, both for von Trier's provocative masterwork The Idiots and this fantastic film itself. For me, Festen is one of the great films of the 90's; a continually gripping drama about families and their secrets and a modern-day Greek tragedy of epic proportions.",

            "content": "Oh my god- this is fantastic! A danish extended family all get together at a large mansion in the country to celebrate the 60th birthday of the patriarch of the family which sort of has an unmentioned shadow over it since one of the family members recently came to a bad end in that same mansion.Rough germanic mannerisms create quite a stir of hilarious foul language with the comedy that comes from the different characters interpretation of what this day should mean and how they interact with each other.This is a rough flick in that it handles the idea of a large extended family protecting someone at the expense of a few of the other family members- a common and disturbing practice. It was chilling to see the various family members lie through their teeth and rewrite history to avoid confronting uncomfortable truths about their own inaction.This movie's location reminded me of various large old hotels I have been to in Switzerland and the characters act very German but that's only because I don't really know what a Dane is, I just know Danish act very German in that they don't like to expose their personal affairs publicly and pull excessive stunts to avoid the appearance of being imperfect. Keep up a good facade of fakery at all costs pretty much. Danish also sounds like German a lot(this is a subtitled foreign film).There are some beautiful European women in this film and it has an indie feel to the camera shooting- at times you feel like you are one of the guests.. it's very well done.Near the last bit of the movie the pacing falters but I think that's on purpose to create a sense of confusion we can share with the guests on how to take it all.If you are familiar with the hypocritical abusive parent screaming from the highest rooftop they are without sin and then try to turn it around on you, you will appreciate the dynamics of this plot. It's a powerful film that is funny at the same time.IF you have traveled in Europe the architecture of this mansion will be especially entertaining as so many little details are to be had here- there are many subtleties to the plot and the characters and the plot is simply fantastic!!",

            "content": "FESTEN, aka THE CELEBRATION, has many eerie similarities to William Shakespeare's play HAMLET. The most obvious similarity is both are set in Denmark. More specifically, both are set in the elegant residence of an unappealing patriarch who, as the story begins, is celebrating a milestone accomplishment. Both FESTEN and HAMLET have a disturbed youth returning from another European country to attempt being cordial to his detestable parent. To make the parallel stronger, the actor who plays Christian in FESTEN bears an uncanny resemblance to a young Laurence Olivier. In the play, Christian laments the untimely death of a dear female friend, much the same as Hamlet laments Ophelia. Of course, both protagonists have a deep secret that they must reveal about their detestable parent and feigning insanity may be in the plans. Hamlet and Christian both are disappointed in their mother who seems to also know her husband's secret but offers to support him rather than her disturbed son. These similarities in no way detract from the impact of FESTEN. In a way, they elevate its worth in my opinion.",

If Your don't know the specific dogme-rules, check themselves out by searching the net. Unconventional and annoying photography is one of the rules, as the camera has to be hand held. Yes, it's able to annoy, but it doesn't matter - the story behind this film is so compelling, you don't mind.It all starts as we see a lot of people going to celebrate father's 60ieth birthday back at the mansion. The siblings at coming with their respective families, quite different from each other. The oldest son has prepared a speech of which only a couple others in the kitchen know about. They look forward to it.When the son starts off his speech, the story really kicks off, and from then on the son is a walking nightmare, at least to his father! This also shows how important the idea of dogma-rules is. It helps in understanding that a good movie doesn't need all the fuss, if the acting and manuscript is good.I give this a rare 10 out of 10, since I think this is the best film I saw since 1995 (Se7en).

Finally I had the chance to see it on video, and I must say this movie kicks every tearjerker Hollywood movie out there. I do not mean to classify this a tearjerker, 'cause it is not.It is a tale of people living with a dark secret and wanting to get rid of this finally after a long time. I did not know the secret before I started watching this, so 30 minutes or so into the movie it hit me smack in the face as if I had driven into a wall at 50 mph. It was so shocking to hear it that I felt very uncomfortable watching people in so much pain being misunderstood, exiled.The biggest asset in this movie must be the Dogme 95 Manifest. The emotions in the story are perfectly portrayed by all of the magnificent cast, who are truly awesome. The emotions do not come from some composer's teary soundtrack or a director of photography's lighting, this is pure and simple an actor's movie. Vinterberg directs this cast with such confidence that you are bolted to your chair for 105 minutes.The symbolic constant reappearance of Christian (Ulrich Thomsen) was a great find in letting him portray the secret that won't go away and will come back to haunt the family, his way of playing this character was riveting, always on the bring of insanity, but on the other in total control of his feelings. The brother Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen) is the obnoxious rascist person who has trouble with just about everybody. He doesn't know anything about this secret and can't believe a word his brother is saying. Sister Helene (Paprika Steen) is the one who doesn't want the secret to come out in order to save the family from its own dark secrets, during the course of the movie she is eating by her own guilt and ultimately gives in to it. Sister Linda (Lene Laub Oksen) is the sister who has committed suicide a year before this story unfolds because of this horrible secret. Certainly the most tragic of all characters was the mother (Birthe Neumann) of all the children, she has known about this all along and doesn't want anybody to know this secret either to protect her husband or in fear of her husband. She has lost a daughter to this secret and has to live constantly on the edge between truth and lies.Certainly not everybody will like this movie as much as I did. But people who are willing to pay attention to story, great acting and are not turned off by shaky camera movement are in for a rollercoaster ride.And I keep referring to the \"secret\" in this review because I don't want to spoil anything for first-time viewers.10/10",

Already in the first scene with the younger brother throwing his own wife and kids out of the car in a rather rude way, it becomes obvious that this movie will not meet the usual standards of etiquette.As the movie sticks to the rules of the Dogma 95 manifesto, the whole shooting was done by hand-held cameras. The hence somewhat shaky pictures may be a bit irritating in the beginning but at the same time, they make one feel being very close to the action and the unusual visual angles that become possible by using this technique, draw into the movie. Also, be aware that the movie does not use any background music, which is another concession to the Dogma 95 rules.The most shocking element of the movie probably is not the unadorned disclosure of the committed pedophilia itself but the fact that the whole pretending of being a family with respect for each other is an utter lie and has been for a very long time. It is only conventions of behavior that helped to keep up appearances. Especially the mother is living in her own world of negating the undeniable facts that once were presented to her very own eyes.Then, while some hard-boiled spectator may still shrug his shoulders thinking, that every family has its black sheep and maybe also its obnoxious Boor like the younger brother Michael, the whole evening party starts singing a racist song which is directed towards the black boyfriend of the daughter. Although this happens under the influence of alcohol, one could reply that alcohol only reveals the real character of people, ending in the conclusion that great parts of society are corrupted in a certain way. Some spectator may be able to relate to similar events in his own family background and start feeling uncomfortable about it. Still the movie is not all negative since there are also some pleasant characters like the waitress Pia (plaid by a young Trine Dyrholm) who is in love with the elder son of the family. At the end of the movie her affection is being answered and there is even hope that they both will live a happy life in Paris.For all those, who are looking for a feel-good movie, please go a long way round this one but for all those who fancy exposures of a complacent bourgeoisie, this is a must see.",

It's his sixtieth birthday and a display of happy unity of the clan is in order. The extended family arrive from far and wide to settle in for a residential banquet. Including Christian - who nobody actually invited, and not his sister, who happens to be dead.From the icy charm of the bourgeoisie to the loving arms of the chambermaid, Celebration (Festen) lures us into a comfort zone with the trivia of various family members as we get to know them. Little do we realise that there is a speech coming at the formal dinner that will shock and splinter, producing a night of heart-break as family skeletons are dredged up with shattering effect. Like a macabre travesty, the horrors that are revealed are stifled beneath the stiff upper lip of black tie and bravado, until the only celebration is one of confronting truth.Director Thomas Vinterberg achieves remarkable results within the strict remit of the rather arbitrary 'Dogme95' rules of minimalist film-making. Everything is shot with a domestic video camera in low light or candlelight - looking rather like a home movie about a family gathering. Given the rather bland nature of the first half - both visually and with a story that comprises little more than day-to-day emotional ups and downs - there is a temptation to switch off and dismiss Celebration as a pretentious failure. Unfortunately for viewers who simply want to be entertained, there is very little to see. But for serious minded audiences it is well worth the wait for it for it all to kick off. \"The main course is a surprise,\" as one character so aptly points out.Head of the table Helge is given the choice of two alternative speeches from one of his offspring - the green or the yellow. It has all the innocence of family charades. And then the bottom falls out. Nastily, disturbingly, sickeningly - and so on. And it doesn't stop. After first revelation, it's a dizzying descent through moral quagmires as people try to keep the party going. But it is so realistic that we feel the pain of family members - even as they try to hide behind the fa\u00e7ade of formal dress.A slightly theatrical touch is the staff taking all the car keys so no-one can leave. Together with the documentary-like feel of the movie, it creates an almost unbearable claustrophobia. \"Feel what it means to spit in your family's face!\" snaps Helge to his recalcitrant progeny. We do.Many filmmakers have done little with the realism that Dogme95 can evoke but Vinterberg uses it to full effect. We are so convinced of the ordinariness of everything that the plot developments, as they pile up, trap us into empathising with characters that are in a profoundly uncomfortable position. He takes a very dramatic situation but hits us between the eyes by concealing it until we expect nothing out of the ordinary. He says, \"The characters played by Ulrich Thomsen and Thomas Bo Larsen arise from my fascination with James Caan and Al Pacino in The Godfather, and Moritzen's patriarch was of course inspired by good old Marlon, not that I'm making any comparisons, of course.\"Almost a parallel to the Dogme revolution against style over substance and the abuse of art by Hollywood, Celebration is cinema at its most powerful but without reliance on technical wizardry or artifice. Its simplicity and emotional force reminds me of the famous stage-to-screen melodrama, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf. Except that Celebration, after its release, accomplished that rarest of feats by being adapted for stage, to critical acclaim on London's West End and then going on to Broadway. Adaptations in German, Greek, French, Italian, Swedish, Polish, Czech and Slovenian followed. One critic said, \"It suggests not merely that there is something 'rotten in the state of Denmark' but that pomp and ceremony are universally a mask for guilt.\"The very first Dome95 film, Celebration puts Denmark firmly back on the map in the history of cinema.",

            "content": "Festen (The Celebration) impresses on many levels.  Compared to other productions, particularly those of Lars Von Trier, there are more abstract elements, less of a documentary style and more emphasis on storytelling. In the earlier part of the film when you are getting to know the family members and their circumstances and personalities, there is wonderful intercutting between the brother's and sisters in their various rooms within the hotel where the party is taking place, which in tandem with the unfolding narrative regarding the demise of their late sister is incredibly powerful. A striking tale which looks at issues of sexual abuse, family politics and how people react to shock, I would strongly recommend Festen to anyone, especially those familiar with the Dogme style who aren't put off by it.",

This enough should have made it hard to stand, but there is more. It is the anniversary of the head of the family. He is 60 and he invited his parents, his children and grandchildren and some family friends. They all try desperately to stick to the routine of social gatherings, but can't as the big son makes a shocking announcement.From then on, it is both fascinating and frightening to see how our social instincts shape our behavior, even in situations that are well beyond normalcy. Suicide, incest, racism, adultery, home violence, class exploitation, they are all in this movie with civilized upper class white people. This is one of the movies that abide by the Dogma 95 rules. That means, among other things, that you can't add props, use studio sounds including music), add special lightning or filters, credit the director and that you must use a hand-held camera. This adds to the difficulty of watching the movie along with the language and the terrific social tension, but I do think it is worth the effort.At one time a guy tries to use a club to beat somebody and another one stops him. Was that a subtle irony to the Dogma 95 rule that you can't use weapons or depict murders? :)",

The merits of the manifesto lie less in the fact that such trickery is bad (indeed, there are always new tricks available to the clever artist, and the wholly naturalistic film would be wholly dull), but in that it encouraged directors to think about what they were doing, and not fall back on clich\u00e9d short-cuts to induce certain responses in the audience. But a great film is a great film, whatever the rules under which it is made; and 'Festen' reminded me of Robert Altman's 'The Wedding', which begins with a long zoom shot from a static camera, the complete antithesis of the hand-held style that 'Dogme 95' dictates.'Festen' starts as a black comedy, the tale of the re-union of a highly dysfunctional family. But it soon becomes clear there's a reason for this dysfunction, and the story soon becomes truly horrifying, yet utterly convincing in its depiction of how a bully can remain unchallenged. Perhaps the take-home message it that crimes that can never be forgiven can never be acknowledged, either. Although the darkness gradually overwhelms the humour, it's a superbly executed movie, ultimately sympathetic but completely unsentimental, and with an immediacy that is the benefit of the chosen method.",

I am one of that film's few supporters (there aren't even many people in the US who have seen it, and most who have, whether an American or not, don't like it), but The Celebration blows it away. Idioterne, though exhilarating, is flawed. This is partly due to the quickness of its conception, production, and editing. The Celebration, however, is flawless. It contains some of the greatest editing ever. Watch the scene where three characters are linked together in a split second around bath tubs and suicide. It is enough to make your heart skip a beat.\nFesten also has some of the most complicated characters you're ever going to see in a film, and they're involved in one of the most complex situations that could be conceived. You'll be laughing in one moment, then you'll be beaten down emotionally, and then you'll shake your fists in anger.\nThere has been much said about the pretentiousness of Dogma '95. I personally think it is a great idea. I have heard that \"it seeks to destroy the very foundations of filmmaking that artists have tried for 100 years to build.\" I say, good! That's what Italian Neorealism sought to do, and it produced The Bicycle Thieves, Umberto D, and La Strada among others. It's also what the French New Wave attempted to do, and it produced Breathless, Shoot the Piano Player, and The 400 Blows. Need I say more? I have hardly ever felt that a situation was more realistic in a film when the Dogma rules were used. The Idiots, The Celebration, and other films made in a similar style, Dancer in the Dark and Breaking the Waves. Dogma 95 is attempting to do something ORIGINAL. I know that scares the heck out of most people, but thank God for these directors. Even if they don't produce something as great as Idioterne or Festen, it will at least be interesting. I predict that in less than 20 years, The Celebration will be taught in film classes.",

            "content": "I know some have compared this to some of Luis Bunuels work but this is a much tougher and realistic film and I don't think this compares to Bunuel at all. This film starts out with a family and many friends getting together for a birthday bash in the Danish countryside. Christian (Ulrich Thomsen) is picked up on the side of the road by his brother Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen) and they head to the hotel for the 60th birthday of their father Helge. They are joined by their sister Helene (Paprika Steen) and it is the same place that Christians twin sister drowned herself in a bathtub. At dinner Christian gives a toast and announces that Helge molested him and his sister when they were young and that he was responsible for her death. Meanwhile, one of the girls that helps in the kitchen had an affair with Michael and tells him she had an abortion. The cooks and the rest of the help take all the guests car keys and hide them so nobody can leave. Helene's boyfriend shows up late and he's African-American and at one point everyone in the room starts singing a racist song. The story is strong and so are the performances but one thing that I did not care for is the way it was shot on video and blown up to 35mm so it has that rough docudrama look that Lars Von Trier does also. The whole film was shot with hand held cameras and there is no music added to this film. In fact, there is no added sounds at all in this film. Thats part of the style Dogma 95 and I personally don't care for it. I wish they would abandon this style and start hiring good cinematographers with more contemporary equipment to make a more professional looking film. The script is very good and the tension at many points of this film could be cut with a knife! I started cringing and wincing everytime Christian would make his way to the table, I knew another dreaded toast was on the way. The script does a good job with some of the more unpleasant characters like Michael by giving them some purpose to the story than just being obnoxious. By the end of the film you come to discover that he had a reason to be part of the film. For you admirers of trivia, director Thomas Vinterberg is not listed in the credits but he does have a cameo as a cab driver. Well written film is enhanced by solid performances but the overall style of the filming is an irritant. Too bad!",

All performances are stellar - from Ulrich Thomsen's Christian to the wonderful Paprika Steen's Helene, but for me, the performance of the film is by Henning Moritzen as the father, Helge, whose 60th birthday celebration it is which draws his whole family together. When he flatly denies his oldest son's accusations of rape, complete with a tinge of outrage, I almost believed him - but not quite.This film is about the layers of culture and mannered behaviour which are ultimately only of molecular thickness, so that when the layers are peeled away, only the fittest can survive. The cocoon safety of the family unit quickly becomes the jungle. For me, the most shocking scenes were when Christian is beaten up for revealing this family secret so publicly, and when the remainder of the family simply got on with the festivities as though he had never spoken of what his father did to his twin sister and himself when they were children. Anyone who has blown the whistle - at work, in politics, and within families - will be familiar with this level of mass denial, followed by counter- accusation, then the inevitable being cast out. Given this is a Dogme film, we the viewer are drawn into proceedings almost as though we are there, and so when something shocking happens, we are shocked also, partly because we realise we are part of the story and no longer at the safe distance of a casual observer. It is worth sitting through a certain level of discomfort to eventually hear the handful of words spoken by Helge which are essentially his admission of guilt. He throws this sentence into the air, almost as though he's daring his family members to believe him. The contempt he has for his children is clear.This film is for lovers of cinema. I'm not sure I'd call \"Festen\" entertainment, but like other Dogme films, it will give you plenty to think about.",

I'm a big fan of Lars Von Trier's films (apart from The Idiots) and I understand that he was part of the whole Dogme 95 wave of filmmaking which saw Danes making films on hand-held cameras, using no props and no false lighting. Festen is the first official film to adhere to all these rules, although director Thomas Vinterberg did later admit to covering a window in one scene. Naughty, naughty! You'd think that it would be pretty difficult to make a good film in these conditions (have you seen The Idiots? It's dreadful!) but Festen somehow pulls it off. It's not just a good film, it's a great film.I was immediately engaged from the start with the strange camera angles and movements instantly grabbing my attention. In fact, it's this strange visual style which makes the film so involving and gripping. At times it feels like we're watching a fly-on-the-wall documentary, or perhaps some found footage from one of the guests. It also helps that the performances feel so real. You completely buy into the whole situation, no matter how darkly farcical it becomes.Festen features an array of characters who stick in your head after the film has finished. My favourite was probably Michael who had me laughing out loud on several occasions. He's an utterly over-the-top vile loon! Of course, the more you see of him, the more you start to dislike him and wonder how on earth he ever got married and managed to have two kids in the process! The film really gets going when one of the sons gets up to do a speech. Awkward doesn't even begin to describe it.The less you know about Festen the better! I avoided reviews because I didn't want any of the various shocks or twists revealed to me. That way you can become one of the guests who look in horror as the family's dysfunctions are revealed over the course of the night. I think a lot of credit has to go to Thomas' screenplay. It's a wonderful script which makes full use of its one-location idea and reveals its drama through character interactions which don't feel contrived in any way.I understand that Festen has been turned into a play and I can see why. There's so much bubbling under the surface and it often explodes beautifully in front of us. I love the way the characters slowly develop as the film goes on, as we get to learn new things about them. It makes the film so much richer and deeper. I also loved the ambiguity of it all. It's never made clear, until the end, whether what's being said is true or not.Towards the end of the film, Festen reveals itself as something much more than a dark comedy. It becomes a very sad and moving tale about childhood atrocities and losing someone you love. There's a haunting dream sequence at the end of the film which I found beautifully done and quite emotional. Festen is a great film, full of great performances and excellent filmmaking. Thomas Vinterberg isn't afraid to shock the audience, but unlike Lars in The Idiots, the controversial material is all relevant to the story and not used merely to make the audience react.",

Unfortunately, this is one of the dictates that undermines the viewing of the film; on the one hand there is some great photography as seen in the early car scenes and on the other hand there is so much shaky and jerky camera work that viewing becomes very irritating, perhaps intentionally so.Nevertheless, I add my endorsement to this collective and the purity of its aims. I rated this film 8/10 for its excellent cast and its unpredictable, cohesive, and disturbing narrative, but I would have rated the movie 9 if the subtitles had been edited for consistency and verisimilitude by someone for whom English was their first language. Forgive me if I am wrong but it does not appear so; characters use a wide range of strong language that is unsatisfactorily translated.I must add that I particularly approve of the collective's disavowal of the use of script contrivances like murder and weapons - devices that are absurdly banal in typical film industry product.",

But the film seemed to be pretty much of an exercise in following their little rules, which results in a movie that left me longing for the artistry of real cinematography. The producer described the Dogmatists was wanting to strip away the pretensions of big expensive films, and that is something  I appreciate. But I want to see the actors faces. Take a film like Crumb, really low budget, but you see everything. Celebration didn't seem to really care about its characters or story which I found incredibly trite and unbelievable. I was told I'd be profoundly moved and that people all over the world were really moved by this film, but I just did not believe in the story at all. It was quite a crude effort at writing a family story with a big secret, which reminded me a bit of Sam Shepard plays from the 70s. Big weird family with a horrible secret to be discovered. Or to go way back, Eugene O'Neill. But those family stories are so far better written than Celebration--it is just nothing as a story. And the wearing effect of the visual quality as the movie gets literally darker and grainier as it goes along reminded me of experiences I've had in bad theaters where I've had to complain about the lighting. I like the idea of stripping away pretense and making movie making possible without enlisting the approval of big companies, but I assume in the future it can be made to look better and that the writing will really count and the acting will be good. There was one fine actor in the movie, the father, who was in Bergman's Cries and Whispers, and I started thinking about Bergman, who had very beautiful cinematography: it's not something to be scorned.",

            "content": "Festen is a Danish film that details a successful patriarch's 60th birthday celebration. The man, Helge, is visited by his relatives, children, and friends, all of which respect him. That is, until one of his two sons, Christian, stands up at dinner and accuses Helge of some horrendous acts done in the past involving sexual abuse. Initially, the visitors ignore the outrageous claims, but things unfold as Christian continues to act against his father. Thus, the birthday celebration turns into a manifestation of the despicable relationship between Helge and his children. The final scene brings some surprise, not in a plot twist but in the way its played out. Overall, the story is involving and has many aspects that are easy to relate to for all audiences.There are some interesting technical aspects. The camera is largely hand-held, leading to much shaking and rocking and rolling. Although it added to the family atmosphere, it was distracting at times. The acting was well done, especially with the two brothers Christian and Michael. Ulrich Thomsen plays Christian, the son that appears to be mentally unstable until evidence is able to support his claims. Thomsen's acting style is effective and gives a strong impression of deep struggling. The character that really jumped out at me was the other brother, Michael, acted by Thomas Bo Larsen. Even though he is a simple-minded, ignorant, and rather mean character, its hard not to like him. Despite his negative traits, it becomes clear that he is an innocent but mislead individual. He often serves as comedic relief, but also has deeper significance in the events.Festen pulls the audience right in, mostly due to its compelling story and characters that are easy to relate to. The dark past of the family serves as an intriguing plot element that satisfies to create an unusual celebration. Recommended for everyone, but especially for people that love unconventional yet dense movies.",

            "content": "Festen is utterly essential viewing. Simply masterful in its construction; heart rending, intellectually engaging and original. What comment does it make? That the rituals of civility can mask the worst barbarity and that justice and truth can be dismissed as madness or foolishness or conceit if it convenient to do so. And that most of us take sides according to how it advantages us. So many of us are only interested in what serves our vanity. So very few of us stand up for truth. Often those that do are ridiculed or seen as unseemly; outsiders and disadvantageous.Its a devastating indictment of the human condition as one of brute competition and powerplay. There are only two methods of salvation from this. Heroism and love. The eldest son gains his heroic strength throughout the film through a series of humiliations, as well as physical and mental battles. The remaining daughter, from the love she has for her family, and the trust she places in her socially rejected but utterly beautiful guiding light of a boyfriend finds her way through puzzles, confusion and doubt toward the truth.The ambiguity of the smaller roles fill the film out with a Shakespearean richness. The wife of the younger brother - cowed victim or shabby harridan? The singing grandma - oblivious and dotty or sinister and affected? The depressed uncle - self-involved joke or victim of circumstance? It is the ambiguity of these characters that reinforce the tension of the main plot. Did the father or didn't he? Is the son an insane troublemaker or an avenging hero?And lets not forget the chorus of the waiting staff - guiding us through the evening, none except the chef (a conductor of sorts) quite sure where the evening is going.This film is a spoken opera.

            "review_title": "The #1 Dogme movie - and still the greatest!",
            "content": "Danish Thomas Vinterberg's FESTEN from 1998 is, in my not-so-humble opinion, the greatest movie of the The Danish New Wave which began in the 90's with Ole Bornedal's cynical thriller NATTEVAGTEN from 1994, and sadly is on the verge of ending now (2007) - ironically again with Bornedal as a front-runner. However FESTEN remains a remarkable testament to a time in Danish cinema history where directors managed to bridge the gap between art and mainstream, at first in the early 90's by reaching the audiences in eye-hight with movies that had a realistic feeling to them, and then in the late 90's with the Dogme95 movement that gained Danish cinema a success it hadn't experienced since the silent-movie era of Carl Theodor Dreyer and Benjamin Christensen. Thomas Vinterberg was/is a member of the Dogme95 brotherhood created by Lars von Trier, and FESTEN was the first movie directed under the 10 rules of the Dogme95 manifesto, which provocateur Ole Bornedal recently dubbed nothing but \"a smart producer trick\" in the Danish movie magazine Ekko.FESTEN is a so-called docu-drama that deals with the consequences of incest, family secrets, family relations, and family rituals. It depicts the Danish mentality by putting the Danish upper-class family Klingenfeldt on display. There happens so much between the lines in the Klingenfeldt family. The consequences of the family father Helge's (Henning Moritzen) incestuous cruelties to his four children in the past are obvious: the sister (Lene Laub Oksen) has recently committed suicide, Christian (Ulrich Thomsen) has a strained relationship to the women of his life, Helene (so-called Dogme-queen Paprika Steen) is a paradoxical upper-class eccentric hippie-type who smokes weed, and little-brother Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen) is a violent screw-up who won't acknowledge the truth about his father. However Helge is never portrayed as an arch-typical villain. He is brilliantly portrayed by Henning Moritzen as a realistic three-dimensional character. In FESTEN everyone is pretentious and cool on the surface, but the pain and secrets of these characters shines through the social hypocrisy constantly - therefore it's more a story about the unspoken than the spoken.When the guests arrive at Helge's 60th birthday celebration party, Helge and his wife (Birthe Neumann), the two sons and the remaining daughter welcome them at the entrance. We hear how everything said is excruciatingly superficial and stupid. The words, the hand-shakes and the hugs don't mean anything. Don't they have anything substantial to say to each other? In another scene Christian exposes the family secret in his first speech, however the dinner guests just ignore it, and keep going on, as if nothing has happened. It takes Christian three more speeches, and one from Helene reading aloud the suicide letter from her sister, before the truth is acknowledged. It's shocking to see the guests sit there and do nothing! This is the typical Danish mentality: nobody wants to interfere - everybody minds their own business. Helge confronts Christian merely to manipulate him into thinking he is insane! In a third scene scene the social misfit Michael makes the dinner guests, unaware of their wrong-doing, sing aloud the old seemingly innocent, however really underneath racist Danish song 'Jeg har set en rigtig negermand' in order to provoke Helene and her African-American boyfriend Gbatokai (Gbatokai Dakinah). This scene implicates Michael's insecurity and displays Danish racism at its worst. There are many more scenes worth high-lighting, but these three are great examples.Everything works in FESTEN: the fully-developed three-dimensional characters, the acting, the innovative hand-held Dogme95 camera style, Vinterberg's and Mogens Rukov's manuscript. Many has hypothetically tried posing the question: what did the Dogme95 rules do for FESTEN that it couldn't have done without? I say everything. One has to realize that everything that worked so beautifully in this gem was worked out on basis of the (paradoxically liberating) limitations of the manifesto. Every decision from the manuscript (real locations, genre-movies not allowed etc.) to the acting is made on the basis of Dogme95. If stylish camera and lighting setups were a possibility the harsh realism and fly-on-the-wall-feeling of it wouldn't have been achieved, and it wouldn't have been the same movie. As Lars von Trier put it: \"Limitations are liberating\" meaning that complete freedom leaves one with too many options, so creating rules is just a way of setting up the playground.I have a particular fondness for this movie. FESTEN along with the second and third Dogme95 movies, Lars von Trier's IDIOTERNE from 1998 and S\u00f8ren Kragh-Jacobsen's MIFUNES SIDSTE SANG from 1999 introduced me to a more intelligent and interesting way to approach movie-watching. FESTEN has an arty feeling to it. Apparently the time was just right for such a movie, but as aforementioned it managed to bridge the gap between art and mainstream. It's a dark, funny, and intelligent movie. Perhaps the humor made it so easy to swallow for audiences world-wide in spite of the arty hand-held camera-style and raw realism. What surprises me to this day is its international success, because the tone of the movie is Danish (I would think). Perhaps the social hypocrisy portrayed in FESTEN, which feels so Danish, is in fact a world-wide phenomenon. Watch this! 10/10",

We are slowly introduced to a comfortably middle class Danish family, then sit transfixed as all their respectability dissolves away. This is not pleasant viewing, but it is utterly compelling.  Tension is maintained throughout the film by a series of knife-edge scenes, at so many stages you feel the film will burst and snowball into unrestrained violence. The violent behaviour of Michael (erratic younger brother) always stays three seconds ahead of bodily harm to himself and others.  Another tense moment is created by the head chef collecting all the party-goer's car keys so they can't escape from the terrible pronouncements of Christian - at this stage I was convinced of all out war. The treatment of Gbatokai, the black American who is the butt of a racist song is tormenting. Don't watch this film to be uplifted, watch this film to try and understand the depth of being human and the way we all interact. I don't think there is a finer portrayal of a dysfunctional family (and society too) in any other film",

            "content": "The Celebration is famous for being the first \"Dogme-95\" film and somewhat invented the rules for this new art-house styled genre. It was an idea first invented by Lars Von Trier who set up the rules for making a Dogme film and first got the idea for starting up the system when he made Breaking The Waves and then decided to invent the true routine of how to make a Dogme film. The Celebration became the first official Dogme film and remains the turning point for this modern approach to art-house cinema. Thomas Vinterberg admitted to breaking the rules of dogme film-making when he covered up a window during the filming of The Celebration.So what is Dogme exactly? Some people have found it very perplexing to what actually makes a Dogme film; well the answer is that on the surface it is about gaining the utmost realism when making a film. It means a director can't rely on special-effects, artificial sounds, props/sets are not to be brought onto the premise of filming, music can't be used unless it occurs in the scene and no non-natural lighting is allowed. This is just the basic drift of what creates a Dogme film. It's a fascinating idea that really does help to bring out the needed realism that has been taken away by too many effect-driven Hollywood films.The Celebration is a story that revolves around an extremely dysfunctional family who're all gathering for the 60th birthday of the \"likeable\" head of the family. From the abrupt opening we're introduced to many repulsive characters that're all on their way to this grand party. The tension is slowly built up to a shocking outburst from one of the party-host's sons who unveils some dreadful truths during his \"supposed\" toast to his father \u0085 Critics across the world have applauded and hailed The Celebration as one of the finest films to come out of modern art-house cinema. When I first watched The Celebration I had read quotes from critics saying it was a darkly funny film, yet I didn't find one moment of the film and rather found it to be a first-class study of a shattered family and a film that I found was a sincerely difficult watch. It's not a film to be taken lightly and there are moments of the film where you almost pity the characters for standing in front of people and revealing shocking truths about one-an-other to a roomful of people. Thomas Vinterberg manages to succeed in making the viewer cringe in their seats while they watch an evening of detestable human behaviour pan-out.There are many films that go out of the way to shock and exploit problems, without actually making the viewer compelled to continue watching or paying attention. This is because the story eventually becomes ridiculous and pointless, since it seems to lack any meaning or study of the problem at hand. But, The Celebration is certainly an unforgettable experience that draws you deeper and deeper into a plot full of twists without making you want to stop watching. I felt obliged to watch to not get side-tracked from the story because it was so intriguing and dangerously exciting.It's impossible not to respect the style of the film because it's one that is so unique and takes cinematic realism to the very depths of its core foundations. The human behaviour throughout the film is one that can be thoroughly studied for its sociological meaning. It remains an enthralling film with some what of a \"mystery\" element to the story and with the sharp style from the hand-held camera you'll get the feel of the stress and anxiety that is perceived throughout the film. The actors and actresses portray the emotions that are rising, flawlessly and with a realistic ease. There are some moments which feel ad-libbed which makes the film feel raw.Something that bothers me about the film and it's where the film slightly loses its purest tone of realism, it's the fact that the children all disappear when the dinner-party starts. It's obviously because the film was not seen as acceptable material for such young children to become apart of. Nevertheless, it is noticeable and it's very rare for someone to ask \"where are the children?\" and so feels as if they've literally vanished from the realism of the story. Furthermore the film does at times feel slightly clumsy and there are moments that feel slightly slow or drawn-out.Overall The Celebration is a landmark film for art-house cinema and remains an enthralling, but challenging picture which demands you to not move away from its complex, narrative structure. There're bound to be people who will dislike the film because of the approach it takes towards telling a story, but if you're a film buff it's a must-see.",

The movie was dead and called for resurrection\" (ohh and you can read their menifesto, where they repeat this twice), so this wundergroup is going to save movies, right? ok. let's trash everything that came after 1960, and replace it with something that was shot with a hand-held camera. I think it's a nice change, but I couldn't stand more movies shot the same way.

His eldest son Christian has returned for the party. His twin sister recently committed suicide. His brother Micheal we quickly discover has temper and drink issues. We see him being cruel to his wife, a domestic servant and later to his sister's boyfriend. Helene their other sister is an anthropologist and she has brought her black boyfriend with her. Micheal despises him and is openly racist.During the course of the dinner, Christian stands to give a toast and tells everybody that his father abused him. The rest of the guests are unsure how to react. Christian repeats the accusation, he is forcibly thrown out by his brother Micheal, his mother wants him to apologise.

The ensemble of players is marvelous. Vinterberg charges each of them with a unique and potent electricity. Their interactions are dense with explosive chemistry and human suspense. Many circumstances are analogous to watching someone fall. You watch it happening, time seems to slow down, and you helplessly cringe when some of the pain is transferred.The subject matter is not silly in the least, but the labyrinthine events of the story sometimes seem facile and, because of the Dogme rules, falser than false reality.

            "content": "\"Festen\" or \"The Celebration\" is a Danish film from 1998, so this one is comfortably over 20 years old now and getting closer to 25 as well. The original Danish title is actually closer to the German title as well. It runs for 105 minutes approximately and the director is Thomas Vinterberg, not even 30 years old, of course who is still having gigantic successes these days and is among Europe's most successful filmmakers. Of course, the recent Oscar-winning \"Another Round\" comes to mind immediately, but there is way more. This film here, which also reached the prestigious 8 at the left side of the comma is one of his early works, but not earliest works. At that point, he was in the industry for almost a decade already as well and worked on several other full feature films before that. He is also the co-writer obviously and the one he collaborated with was the late Mogens Rukov. Not the only collaboration between him and Vinterberg, but it really also wasn't the case that they worked on many films together. As for the cast, you will find Danish actors of course, but many of them have also been in international and Hollywood projects by now. Take Ulrich Thomsen and his appearance in a Bond movie immediately after this one and his inclusion here sure might have helped him with getting a key role in a 007 film. Paprika Steen is also easy to identify, not only because of her first name. Trine Dyrholm was also in it, but she, even if fairly famous too, is not one I immediately recognize. Thomas Bo Larsen also has great screen presence here, maybe more than everybody else, and he has worked with Vinterberg on so many other occasions as well. He was surely among the less likable characters this time, but not the main antagonist, at least not with what we know at the very end.The story turns darker and darker as I stated in the beginning of my review. Early on, it still seems more like a darker comedy for example with the scene in which one character pushes others out of his car and forces them to walk for a mile or so, so he can get in the car with his brother. Now if you think that this is an example of fraternal love, think again. The power plays were immediately there with Thomas Bo Larsen's character and how he plays with Thomsen's in an almost fighting manner. Really a lot about egos there or about the former's ego at least. This is not just visible in terms of physical actions, but also in terms of dialogue as we find out about one character not being too happy about another's success with his business in Paris. This Paris reference also gives a slight bit of positive closure, aside from the key story if you consider that positive, because we have Thomsen's character ask a girl he likes if she wants to come with him to Paris and his brother immediately mocks him and treats him with disrespect. This brother gets his fair share too as he has a conflict with a Black man and is depicted as a prime example of a racist. The song later on is of course another brilliant depiction of that. Maybe Thomas Bo Larsen's character (never know if Bo belongs to the first or last name there) is one who offers the most to discuss here. I mean he is still not a remotely likable man. Look at his anger attack when it comes to shoes. Look at his extramarital affair. Look at the girl he ignored after getting her pregnant. Okay, he did not know that, but still. He also did not care when he found out. Or take it how he loves going against his own brother physically when instructed so by his dad.Then there is said dad of course. For a large part of the film, you cannot be sure if he is really such a monster or if it is just a way for Thomsen's character to punish him, even if the tendency is the latter really from the moment he gives his speech. This is also where the film becomes really brutal in a psychological manner with what it is exactly that he is letting out there and also how he does it with the simple, almost playful introduction. As for the father, we already see a bit of how much of a psychopath he is with his little mindgame early on. It seems as if he has something meaningful to say to his son, maybe about health concerns (my first thought), and then he starts rambling and tells a joke about prostitutes. Enough said really. This is where we knew which direction this entire thing would be heading. Of course, also when he then attacks his son for laughing (well \"laughing\") and immediately tells the son's mother, his wife in a way to make sure there is even more backlash against Thomsen's character. This was from the very start by the way, so sorry for my review not being in chronological order. The end of the birthday celebration then was, however, also chronologically the end for the father, not in a vital sense, but in the sense of company as he has to leave and is made to do so by the other brother, who is also not a likable fellow, but still not as low as his dad. This was of course also a memorable moment with how he goes and his wife is also not going to join him despite how she defended him when giving Thomsen's character the \"chance\" to apologize in front of everybody.Perhaps this memorable ending was also one reason why maybe some people saw more in this film than there actually was. I mean it is well-crafted overall, certainly well-acted, but for a place in the imdb top250 where it's surely not far away from, it's definitely far away in my perception. There were some lengths in here too, especially in the middle part, and this film could have been ten minutes shorter, maybe more. Had they cut the right scenes there, maybe I even would have given it an 8 out of 10. Bus this way. I cannot. The wild camera style is of course a crucial component of the narration here, but I can see why this dogma approach (you also see with Lars von Trier for example) may not be appealing to everybody. I kinda got used to it I would say. It also added a bit of comedy almost when we have the evil brother complain about his shoes and even become violent there when the camera is up where with his face and gestures, then moves down to his feet for a very brief moment and instantly up again. This had a bit of a humurous touch almost, even if I am not sure it was meant that way, but it kinda fits because the film felt lighter early on (also the three piglets comment) than it did in the last segments for sure. Thinking of it, it was still a pretty devastating moment showing us how issues are dealt with in his marriage and how he is not a sane man. Okay, these were just a few scenes and inclusions I discussed now and of course there is way more, but the review is long enough and I shall leave it at that. There was also not really one single moment of hesitation for me if I give this film a positive or negative recommendation. It is the former of course. This is definitely worth seeing, but definitely not if you are in the mood for something uplifting. I give the outcome here a thumbs-up and recommend checking it out, even if it is surely a bit on the overrated side, so perhaps don't expect greatness. Some of the sceneries were also pretty nice.",

            "content": "Festen is I think a film of genius. Theer is plenty of reason to regret, when one looks at films like Idioterne and Festen, that neither Von Trier nor Vinterberg have since adhered even to the spirit let alone to the letter of Dogma 95 (now officially withdrawn). Von Trier has gone on to be a highly successful Hollywood director, Vinterberg to be an unsuccessful one, but nothing either has done has the power and conviction of these Dogma 95 films. The hand-held cinematography is disconcerting, as is the use only of natural light as the shadows lengthen but the disconcertment is in complete rhythm with the theme and development of the film itself. I do not wish this to be a spoiler, but even the coyest synopsis gives away the 'surprise' and it does not matter in he least because it is the treatment of the subject rather than subject itself that really surprises. It is a film that pulls no punches,that cuts into its subject and turns the knife as far as it will go but which (in conformity with the 'vow of chastity' of Dogma 95) contains nothing gratuitous, nothing prurient, no ultra-violence, no falsely-sustained drama, no phoney climax nor shock denouement. Yet all these things (without the vow) might have been seen as 'natural' accompaniments of the theme. In this way the film poses extremely important questions about film and about our conditioned expectations of film quite as much as the questions it poses about society and family relationships. The film remains true to itself and true to its theme from beginning to end. It neither seeks to concoct a happy ending nor a tragic conclusion but achieves a real effect of catharsis all the same. At times it is also appallingly but always appalling. Devoid of sentimentality, it nevertheless achieves a remarkable quality of empathy with all the characters it portrays (the standard of playing being universally excellent). It is a film whose importance will I believe increase with time and which will come to regard as one of the finest of its decade and one of the very best films of the late twentieth century.",

            "content": "As far as I remember I may have watched bits of this Danish film when I did Film Studies in college, but we certainly talked about it, and when I found out it was in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die I was most interested to watch it. Basically the whole of the respective family and friends of businessman Helge (Henning Moritzen) have gathered together at the family-run countryside mansion to celebrate his sixtieth birthday. The family include his wife Else (Birthe Neumann), his eldest son Christian (The World Is Not Enough's Ulrich Thomsen), his younger son Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen), and his daughter Helene (Paprika Steen). After seeing the people gathering in their rooms and catching up with each other, we find out that the other daughter of Helge, Linda, Christian's twin sister, committed suicide, and Helene has found her suicide note, but she hides it before the dinner. We see Michael have a fight with his wife, and we find out that he had an affair with and made a waitress pregnant, but he braves himself as the people start to eat, but then, after his father thanks everyone for coming and stuff Christian decides to make his own speech. He tells all the guests everyone about the fact that his father sexually abused him and his Linda when they were children; everyone ignores these accusations and they assume this is some sort of joke or a figment of his imagination, his father has a private talk with him about this speech, but he appears to apologise. He is encouraged to continue the slander though by hotel chef Kim (Bjarne Henriksen), as she knows about the abuse too, so he continues a toast and says that Linda killed herself because of Helge, to which his father confronts him again and threatens to reveal facts about him. Soon enough Helen's black American boyfriend Gbatokai (Gbatokai Dakinah) arrives to join the party, and this does not make Michael happy as he is racist, and speaking in their own language he gets many of the guests to sing along to a disgraceful racist children's song to offend him. After Else makes a toast to try and put Christian back in everyone's good books, he gets up again to accuse her of witnessing one of the rapes that his father did and not doing anything to stop it, to which he is dragged out by Michael and two other guests. After one or two more attempts to run back into the hall Christian ends up tied to a tree in the nearby woods by his brother and the other two men, but while he is not at the party a guilty Helen finally decides to read the letter she found written by Linda. In the letter Linda writes that she killed herself because she was haunted by dreams of her father raping her, and in a moment of anger Helge admits to everyone that he did indeed abuse Michael, and that it was all he was good for. He leaves the hall and the guests who are all shocked, Christian comes back to the hall and finds out that Michael is missing, and he approaches his father to beat him up and say that he will never see his grandchildren again. The next morning, and the end of the film, Helge admits that he did wrong in the past, and that he does love his children, but Michael is not in the mood to forgive him, Christian is returning to Paris with waitress Pia (Trine Dyrholm), and as he leaves the rest of the family quietly have breakfast. Also starring Helle Dolleris as Mette, Therese Glahn as Michelle, Klaus Bondam as Master of Ceremonies and Lasse Lunderskov as Uncle. This was the first film in a series known as Dogme 95, and something to do do with avant-garde filmmaking, these films had rules, such as on location filming, no inserted sounds, hand-held camera-work, in colour with no special lighting, no filtering, no effects (for something like a murder), a story in present day, no genre, in a certain frame format, and an uncredited director, the only other film I know in the series is The Idiots. Anyway, this new approach to filmmaking makes for an interesting watch, not just when you consider these rules, because it makes the story all the more believable, and it adds to the tense atmosphere, it is a compelling story about something terrible revealed in an event that should be happy, and all in all it is a most watchable drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Good!",

It definitely captures your attention and does not let go till the last minute.I was not very familiar with the Dogme concept till I saw this movie. To tell you the truth, initially I thought my DVD had a problem. The lighting was horrible and the camera movement very jerky and could actually make you sick. Thanks to IMDb I learned that this is due to the rules of Dogme. I don't know, maybe I prefer not to watch another Dogme movie then (already seen Italian For Beginners). I truly believe the movie would have been much better if proper filming equipment was used.The acting was above average as well, and the characters were well defined. I am not sure what era did the movie mean to capture (thought it was modern 1990's), But my concern with character identification, was showing a large crowd as all racists.

            "content": "Thomas Vinterberg's 1998 film, The Celebration, is a film that balances two of storytelling's most fundamental themes, comedy, and tragedy. The film is a glimpse into the lives of a horrifically dysfunctional Klingenfeld family who, on the sixtieth birthday of their patriarch Helge (Henning Moritzen), see their comfortable, carefree, bourgeois lifestyle tainted by an evening of relived trauma, revelation, and betrayal.The film follows the three children of Helge, the eldest son Christian (Ulrich Thomsen), a restaurant owner in Paris and the black sheep of his family, his younger brother Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen), a sleazy drunk, desperate to live up to his father's expectations and their sister, the well-travelled, caring, and progressive, Helene (Paprika Steen). The children, as well as a horde of guests comprised of friends and family, have gathered at one of Helge's Danish countryside hotels to celebrate his birthday. What is expected to be a lavish evening of cocktails, tuxedoes, and excessive amounts of food quickly devolves. Christian proposes a toast to his father, the man of the hour, and gives him a choice between two small envelopes, one yellow, and the other green. Helge makes his choice and his fate is sealed as Christian announces he's selected \"The Speech of Truth\". What follows is the revealing of decades of family secrets rooted in Helge's oppressive sexual deviancy.The Celebration is humourous, tragic, thought-provoking, sensitive, and dark. It is a film that contains the rarity of men being vulnerable on screen, rather than misogynistic, testosterone-fuelled, agents of sex and chaos. But it is also a film that shows that evil man is capable of inflicting on those they're supposed to care for most.While the story is filled with the melodramatic tones of a chamber drama, the actor's performances bring a sense of urgency and reality to the situation. Ulrich Thomsen plays quite possibly one of the most sympathetic male roles in cinematic history. While we don't know every detail of the children's upbringing, it is easy to feel what Christan and his siblings had to endure all while conforming to the bourgeois lifestyle they were born into; being restricted by the shackles of the expectation to look the part of their social class. The actor's on-screen chemistry is undeniable with Larsen and Thomsen lovingly insulting each other in a fashion only brothers could.The film was the first official entry in the \"Dogme 95\" manifesto, put together by fellow Danish director Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg himself. The manifesto outlines a variety of restrictions on the making of the film including having only diegetic sound, only natural lighting, etc. While many of these restrictions can make the final product seem amateurish and clunky, they work in favour of The Celebration. The low-key, intimate, cinematography from Anthony Dod Mantle evokes a feeling that we are not supposed to be viewing this film; that what we are viewing is the home video of one tragic night in a family's history. This feeling is brought on by the film only containing handheld shots as well as the now nostalgic quality created by the distortion of early digital technology.While many viewers cannot relate to the experience of growing up in the high-end, bourgeois, environment the Klingenfeld children did, Mogens Rukov and Thomas Vinterberg do a masterful job at writing a variety of characters who could be related to by anyone from any walk of life.",

            "content": "The very first feature from Dogma 95 movement, Thomas Vinterberg's audacious family expos\u00e9 sets its narrative entirely within a one-day spell, Christian (Thomsen), a seemingly-decorous man comes from Paris to celebrate his father Helge's (Mortizen) 60-year-old birthday at their family-run hotel in a rural Denmark, other family members and friends are also invited, including Christian's younger sister and brother, Helene (Steen) and Michael (Bo Larsen).Frenetically embracing itself to the Dogma 95 doctrines and its trimmings, the film plays out like a horror movie that anticipates the low-budget found-footage creepiness, natural lighting counterpointing its formal grandeur of the event, hand-held camera slithering around like an insidious creature from all possible approaches to observe the impending drama. Vinterberg pulls no punches from Michael's horrendous excesses, insolent, finicky and randy, a male chauvinist pig (with the plot thickening, violence and racism would in no time join up), he is egregiously obnoxious, which trenchantly conveys the impression that he might be the black sheep in the family, who could cause some riot and embarrassment to his holier-than-thou parents, that's a splendid trick to set the premise. On the other hand, a more haunting undertow trickles in concerning about Christian's twin sister Linda, who committed suicide of late in one of the hotel room's bathtub. Through a jumpy montages of actions occurring in each sibling's rooms (boosted by a brilliant idea of peeping from an angle of surveillance), Helene discovers a note Linda left in the latter's room, its context would give the final word about the dirty secrets concealed in this family.The main event of the day is the birthday banquet, Helge, a quintessential upper-crust patriarch, having a stable marriage with Else (Neumann) over 30 years, is well positioned to enjoy that particular day, before all the congratulatory mirth would uncomfortably dissipate after Christian's bomb-dropping toast, not one, not two, but three, vitriolically aiming to his parents. He is relentlessly charged, to seek out justice in his own term (also on behalf of Linda), and the guests' much subdued reaction has been palatably teased out to an almost implausibly farcical sphere, hypocrisy and self-denial run rampant whilst the celebration must go on, at least on its face value (aided by a ludicrous car-keys hiding scheme conceived by the chef). Suddenly, it reminisces of Luis Bu\u00f1uel's surreal allegory THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962), no one can leave the party, where moral corruption and sickening frailties are perturbingly disclosed. Vinterberg displays a shrewd discernment of the socio-psychology among his subjects, and the ensuing pay-off is uncompromisingly gripping, until the finale sets its ambiguous tone on the aftershock. What happens happens, the surviving damaged goods have to carry their bloodline no matter what, a human tragedy stems deep from the vein of human nature's vice and cruelty .The Danish cast illuminate with affecting performances galore, Thomsen as the silently-fuming Christian, Steen as the unstably nervy Helene, Moritzen as the unfazed Helge all leave indelible marks in their conflicting narrative arcs; yet, it is Neumann, who kills in the scene of her double- edged speech, such an atrociously refined poise achingly testifies that her Else, should be condemned with no less culpability than her children-molesting husband, and in her final shots, she still vainly attempts to come clean out of it, that is a truly extraordinary scene-stealer. Finally, a disconcerting gripe falls on to Bo Larsen's Michael, a shifty-looking youngest son, he is the bad seed who inherits all the deflects from his parents, and the fact that Vinterberg chooses him to stand in a moral high-ground over them does contribute to some ill-feeling of this otherwise groundbreaking feature film, a liberation from machine-bound unwieldiness and trimming down all the usual accessories, puts the thorny narrative in the centre with raw fierceness and closeness, ultimately, it hits like a sledgehammer, take that?

            "content": "I had to borrow that funny quip from noir classic \"Laura\" for it kind of sum up what this Danish film is bringing us: a bold, poignant and furious portrayal of a family masking an atrocious history within an apparatus of proud almost-aristocratic hypocritical dignity. I could find no comparison with that film but that's not saying much. So how about starting with a small paragraph about Dogma 95?I saw many films so far but I wasn't truly familiar with that Dogma, I got it about that diploma initially shown, mixing it with a right-of-using visa. Thankfully my honor was intact for I did pick up a thing or two about it a long ago. In my critic of Mark Cousins' famous study of film-making throughout history, I was alluding to that Danish school of naturalistic film artists with Lars and Thomas as initiators. Dogma 95 was and still is a hymn to minimalist originality, without any fancy shots, artificial lighting, a straightforward approach to a story, no tricks, no static filming, truthful dialog and all that jazz. Go find a way to shoot hallucinations, ghosts or flashbacks with that...Still, as an artist, it was amusing to know that I could fulfill my own visions and accomplish significant things without any apparatus, through a lack of art for its own good; for an art with a proudly minor A. My approval of that dogma wasn't without fascination and curiosity and I think that opinion still holds up today, it is so promising to count on that possibility to do big films without much support. Now, would I say that it was a fail? No way. This is a classic and I applaud Thomas to do so much with so many constraints and I can grasp why limitations within your activity can in a way bring a sort of passion and fun and uncommon horizons in filmmaking, purifying it from pompous artificiality or planting a soil of originality allowing imagination to flourish.But that glorious mission isn't without a catch and unavoidably, a focus is lost and things quickly start to look unnatural, which is ironic taking into account that dogma's aiming for pragmatism. As uncommon and brilliant as it was, Art was so distracting, clouding its own topic that I had to watch this film again so I could finally focus on what was occurring within protagonists, not around.And so I could focus on it for as long as all dynamics and plot points could stay within my scrutiny and I could maintain an control on all on-goings, both visually and psychologically. A tough job if you ask. Frankly, I first thought I was watching a flick with that 80s poor quality as if it was shot in piracy or in a dark room if you got my point. It was suspicious again with all that shaky form of shooting, that fuzzy look; out of focus shots and that particular way of showing all protagonist in a hurry, and a mad (or should I say madcap?) situation following a display of fury or brutality or simply: a man throwing his family off a car so his sibling can go with him, missing pumps causing a marital fight and many additional bits of incongruity causing gratuitous confusion.That's right, it was all awkward chaos and I was wrongly anticipating a film with an illusion of distinction first, awaiting angry outbursts to pop up midway and inflict a slow corrosion and finally, masks falling and victims confronting culprits, making for a satisfying conclusion. But as soon as it starts, it's all noisy and angry and within that awkward chaos. You don't know if you should cry or laugh, cathartic hilarity is good but that film had to dig within a difficult taboo and an ugly scandal, and drama or all its tragic implications couldn't bloom in that canvas that had art as a priority...It's a pity for a film about such hot and difficult topics as as trauma, chagrin, guilt, racism and it had its bits of brilliancy, illuminating us on how a family subconscious can unfold through ignominy: particularly Daddy or Mommy intimidating Christian, calling his own lack of trust with girls during his childhood or his instability with jobs, ignoring that it had probably a lot to do with his past, also fascinating was that Black companion who was constantly facing ugly slurs, mirroring Christian's status as a victim who got disapproval from family just at his first accusation against Daddy, showing that villainous affinity and hypocrisy that allow criminals to commit an atrocity in all immunity. So many insights that film could bring to light, not only with its catchy writing but also frantic acting and a hypnotic photography (I'm thinking of its grainy grim photograph at night) but for all its ambition, this film has its failing, and as far as story and insights go, it only built a big wall of artsy flashy stuff with hardly cracks to go wriggling through.Without a doubt, art took away all possibility of drama and got all shocks in abandon in favor of an agonizing wish to push a boundary or two, following that Godly dogma, simply said, it's a cool-looking, flashy (but not unsubstantial) flashy drunk trip.Post Scriptum: In fact, that Dogma 95 was fairly analogous to that Oulipo authors' school in Balzac's nation: a group of writing mad guys always looking for difficult and crazy tasks to accomplish, such as writing a full book without using that sign coming in fifth position in ABC, just what I'm doing right now in this criticism. You got my point but my writing might sound awkward and so could I fulfill my goal to say all I thought about it? Highly doubtful.And that's my actual point about this film.",

            "review_title": "You won't laugh out loud but Danish director gets credit for breaking new ground in the realm of black comedy",
            "content": "The noted Danish director, Thomas Vinterberg, asks the question, 'is there nothing sacred?', and decidedly answers in the negative. Some may call 'The Celebration' a black comedy, which according to Wikipedia, fits the definition: \"In black humor, topics and events that are usually regarded as taboo\u0085are treated in an unusually humorous or satirical manner while retaining their seriousness.\" But the film also falls under the broader category of farce: \"a farce is a comedy that aims at entertaining the audience through situations that are highly exaggerated, extravagant, and thus improbable\u0085Farce is also characterized by physical humor, the use of deliberate absurdity or nonsense, and broadly stylized performances\u0085Furthermore, a farce is also often set in one particular location, where all events occur.\"If one accepts Eric Bentley's definition of farce where one is permitted the outrage without the consequences, then Vinterberg has broken the societal taboos of pedophilia by asking us (in effect) to consider that the consequences of such a transgression might not be as bad as one thinks. Indeed, when Christian spills the beans at his father's big birthday bash that he was molested by his father as a child, the outrage is certainly there for all to see-but the consequences are hardly what the viewer is expecting.'The Celebration' reminds me of a much darker version of 'Seinfeld'. The four 'Seinfeld' buddies are deeply flawed human beings, but once they come across a much darker force (The 'Soup Nazi' as one of countless examples), they must prepare themselves to do 'battle'. The end result is that our 'heroes' may end up a bit 'bloodied', but their far more neurotic counterpart, must inevitably receive his/her comeuppance.Hence, Helge's children, Christian, Michael and Helene, are cast as the protagonists, who inevitably must take their 'evil' father down. But along the way, they too, with their serious flaws, are exposed as pyrrhic victors. Perhaps the most flawed of the three children is Michael. Immediately we see what a hothead he is when he kicks his wife and children out of the car, to give his brother a ride, driving up to the family-run hotel where the celebration will take place. Later, he flips out completely, berating his wife for forgetting to pack his favorite shoes, that he was planning to wear at the party. If there's one wrong note in the film, it's Vinterberg's decision to cast Michael as an out and out racist, after he sings a racist song, disparaging Helene's African-American boyhood. The whole idea here is to highlight the characters' limitations, not make them unsympathetic!Vinterberg also hints that Helene has not lived up to her expectations. When she finds a suicide note belonging to Christian's twin sister, Lisa, who killed herself a couple of months before, she ineffectually hides it, afraid to reveal its contents to anyone. Helene's mother, Else, expresses her disappointment in her surviving daughter by alluding to her failed career choice as a singer and her flirtation with socialism. Else's racism is much more subtle when she claims Helene chose 'anthropology' over 'law' (a dig at Helene's black boyfriend).And finally there's Christian, who Helge reveals during one of their 'one-on-one's', has a history of psychiatric problems and failures of relationships with women. While a victim of sexual abuse as a child, Christian can only ineffectually lash out at his parents in front of friends and family members. Even after his initial claim of abuse, he comes back for 'more', castigating his father again and then his mother, claiming she was a witness to Helge's pedophilia and did and said nothing. The whining Christian ends up being tied to a tree by Michael, as the younger son believes his mother's story that Christian is a teller of 'tall tales'.Soon, however, the far more disturbed Helge gets his comeuppance. After the toastmaster reads Linda's suicide note (given to him by Helene at Christian's behest), the deceased daughter implies she was also molested by Helge (as part of a dream, she says). Helge finally owns up to his behavior, by outrageously stating that was all Christian \"was good for.\" But instead of anyone calling the police, the consequences are minimal for the family patriarch. That evening Michael administers a non-lethal beating; in the morning he beats a hasty exit as Michael asks him to leave the breakfast area\u2014with the further proviso that he will be not be seeing his grandchildren ever again.As for Else, she declines to join her husband 'in exile'. Some internet posters have stated that she too deserved Helge's fate. But consider this: at the time the abuse occurred, what could she really have done? If she had went to the police, would anyone have believed her? Or if she tried to leave with the kids, what kind of financial support would she have had and wouldn't have Helge done everything in his power, to prevent her from taking the kids?You may have noticed, of course, the low quality of the film's production. That's of course due to Vinterberg's allegiance to the Dogme 95 Collective school of filmmaking, which Vinterberg was one of the founding members. We all remember what this silly avant-garde movement was all about: no props, no music, a hand-held camera, filmed on location, director getting no credit, etc. In short, Dogme 95 was just another word for 'low-budget' and a well-meaning attempt by independent filmmakers to achieve parity with the big-budget studios.Vinterberg's real achievement here is extending the genre of black comedy into a new realm. Taboos are refreshingly swept aside with a 'happy ending' (the antagonist is dealt with by his family not the police; facing ostracism instead of a criminal sentence). 'The Celebration' is not much of a 'laugh-out loud' spectacle but still manages to be fairly original.",

            "review_title": "...and I thought my family reunions were rough.",
            "content": "The Celebration (aka Dogme 1: Festen) is a solicitous Danish film that successfully marries smart content with the unique form of the \"Dogma 95\" movement in a way that is complimentary instead of intrusive. The film concerns three siblings who, along with their extended family and friends, get together at their father's country estate to celebrate his 60th birthday (think The Rules of the Game meets Fanny and Alexander). The celebration, though haunted by the recent suicide of the man's daughter, goes as anticipated until Christian, the eldest son, is asked to give a speech. His declamation, which contains the startling accusation that his father repeatedly raped him and his (recently deceased) twin sister when they were children, sparks a series of revelations, accusations, and intrigues that transforms the benign evening into a darkly humorous farce. Supported by a strong cast and the naked Dogma ascetic the film deals with themes of abuse, denial and repression in a way that is intelligent and wholly absorbing.Spearheaded by Danish director/provocateur Lars Von Trier and cosigned by The Celebration director Thomas Vinterberg as a reaction against Hollywood; the \"Dogma 95\" movement rejects all things superficial in film-making including but not limited to artificial lighting, non-diegetic music/sound, tripods, and post-production image manipulation. The Celebration was the first film released that met the Dogma criteria and is, surprisingly, better off for it. The film's shaky, grainy, hand-held camera work and natural lighting (intrinsic to the Dogma movement) lends the film the intimate feeling of a \"home movie\" though the camera work is anything but amateurish. The camera intrusively views the action from a variety of angles both distant (high angle shots from the ceiling) and intimate (among those at the dinner table). The overall effect of this v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style is an immediacy and rawness that magnifies the film's amalgam of emotions. As a result, the characters and their dilemmas become uncomfortably real and affecting. However, it is not solely the film's aesthetic that engenders a strong emotional reaction, it is also the intelligent script populated with well drawn characters and turbulent themes.The screenplay of The Celebration unfolds like a thriller with each new (often drunken) revelation introducing a new theme or expanding on another. The main theme is obviously abuse which permeates the film beyond the aforementioned central conflict between Christian and Helge, (the father). Michael, the younger brother, is verbally and sexually abusive towards his wife, berating her for not packing his shoes then having violent (read: abusive) sex with her. The party guests are (perhaps unintentionally) verbally abusive towards the black boyfriend of Helene, Christian's younger sister, singing a drinking song about a \"Black Sambo whose face was black as pitch.\" Events like these can be understood as a critique of Danish society by Vinterberg who uses The Celebration to reflect upon the petty minded rudeness and audacity he sees in the people of Denmark. Abuse is also noticeable in the families' reaction to Michael's revelation as they violently eject him from the party, going so far as to tie him to a tree. It is this denial of abuse which is, perhaps, more shocking in the film than the overt abusiveness of the family. The theme of denial is perhaps the most affecting theme in The Celebration as it extends through all the characters in the film and even into the audience. In life, people are often predisposed to side with the accused rather than the victim and this is certainly evident in the film. Michael's revelation of his father's abuse at the party is met with silence and disbelief from his extended family. Vinterberg extends these feelings of uncertainty into the audience by continually bringing into question both the truth of Michael's accusation and his character. The seeds of doubt are sown in conversations between Michael and his father who, up until he was accused of rape, seemed like a congenial and benevolent man. In one conversation, the father threatens to tell everyone how \"sick\" Michael was as a child, how he had to ruin everything for others, and even that he was committed at a sanatorium in France. Michael meets these accusations with silence and the way he hangs his head suggests that there is truth to them. Much of the suspense of The Celebration is derived simply from the dilemma of who is telling the truth. Once the truth is known, the theme of denial is also manifest in Christian and his mother's implied repression of the abuse. It can be understood that the abuse Christian endured as a child has had long reaching repercussions on his life. He has repressed those memories and has been unable to move on with his life or have any kind of lasting relationships. The only person who seems to be aware of Christian's situation is Kim, the chef at the estate, who was friends with Christian as a child. He encourages Christian to come out with the truth saying that this is \"his time.\" The events of the film can be understood as a catharsis for Christian as, at the end of the film, he asks Pia (one of the servants at the estate) to go to Paris with him. Another case of repression is seen in Christian's mother, Else, who witnessed him being abused as a child and did nothing about it. She is perhaps the most despicable character in the film (barring the father) and does not deserve her place at the breakfast table at the film's end. Despite the bleak and serious subject matter of the film its tone is darkly humorous as the film plays up awkwardness for laughs. The dark and grainy Dogma aesthetic lends the proceedings verisimilitude and lays bare the characters and their emotions as they deal with themes of abuse, denial, and repression. The Celebration is a perfect marriage of form and content to create a film that lingers in the mind.",

You could compare it to what Claude Chabrol has done in the French cinema of the 60's; digging up the dirt inside the \"bourgeoisie\". \"Festen\" is one of the best psychological thrillers ever made. I am using the word \"thriller\" because there is such a tension inside this film before and after THE eldest son's revelation has been made. You know that something unusual was bound to happen. Actors are unknown (well out of Scandinavia anyway) but are all excellent. This is also an anti-rascist movie which deserves applauses only on this account.

But what you think will be an inter-sibling payoff actually takes a much darker turn.Throughout the film you cannot help but feel the dread of an impending doom, of something going terribly wrong and activating a domino effect of family tragedy. When the moment comes, the big \"Aha\" moment, it's so understated and out of nowhere and at the same time intense as hell. This is the biggest strength of the film.

In my opinion it is akin to the neo-realist movement in Italy after the war. Dogme 95 is maybe a bit more extreme and it is in any case voluntarily chosen. The neo-realist directors simply had to cope with the fact that all the studio's were destroyed in World War II.\"Festen\" is a dogme 95 film about the 60th birthday of a pater familias. His son uses his speech to make serious allegations against his father. On first sight the film is very naturalistic and seems plausible enough. On second sight, I do have my doubts. Accusations as serious as these are made either well prepared or by accident in intoxicated condition. In the film both are the case.Fourteen years later Vinterberg would maken the film \"Jagten\" (2012). The two film titles are not only phonetically related, there is also a relationship between the stories of the two films. The story of \"Jagten\" is 180 degrees different from the story of \"Festen\". \"Festen\" is about true accusations that initially nobody believes. \"Jagten\" is about false accusations but everybody believes them.As a film \"Jagten\" seems more plausible to me. Ironically \"Jagten\" is no longer \"Dogme 95\" at all.",

Any possible change, in whatever direction, would likely make it a less hard-hitting experience. The message is urgent, the storytelling is brutally effective, and every aspect of the craftsmanship is simply superb. And the acting. Holy sh!t, the acting.This is a film that must be viewed multiple times (get the DVD!). The story is quite simple, but the characters and their relations are anything but. There's so much understated history in Festen that it probably would be a trilogy if everything were spelled out.For instance, what role did grandpa have in making Helge a child abuser? Is he really as senile as he behaves, or is that partly an act he plays to avoid responsibility? Maybe I'm over-interpreting, but I get the impression that Helge was continuing a sick family tradition. This family certainly has plenty of sick traditions.At one point, Helge seems to be hinting at an incestuous relationship between Christian and his dead sister, but then slides over to a more general accusation of being an unsupportive brother. Is Helge trying to deflect his own guilt, or is Christian in fact more than a simple victim? The ambiguity is brilliantly done (resolved in the climax).And the little details. When Helge changes from black tie to bathrobe, he's finally ready to change from monster to human. The symbolism here works on every level, from personal unmasking to larger social criticism.Much has been said about the Dogme95 agenda; some like it and some don't. In the hands of a lesser director than Vinterberg, the Dogme tricks could easily come down to a gimmick, and it certainly won't work for every movie. But in Festen it's used, with devastating effect, to enhance the merciless realism of the story.Festen is an emotional roller coaster that left me completely drained. Despite the grim subject matter, it's sprinkled with the kind of absurd, black humor that makes you laugh, and then immediately feel bad for laughing. When Helge delivers his list of nasty counter-accusations, Christian just keeps eating with this blank, detached look on his face. This is oddly funny, but it's also how clinically depressed people often behave.In the end, Festen is a powerful, optimistic story of redemption and personal growth. The old man had to be broken so the children could start healing. I like to think that even the father came out of this a better man. The younger brother ends up a little less of an a-hole. His response to Helge's apology was another perfect moment: That's great dad, we all appreciate it, but forgiveness will take more work than a few pretty words.",

These movies make voyeurs of us all. But I don't go to movies to see what I already know. If it's already in my head, I  don't need to sit in a theater to review it.

You don't need expensive special effects, a famous cast, exotic locations and a complicated story. Dogma 95 has been quite a successful way of making movies. The rules are maybe a little bit too restrictive, but definitely had to be introduced to in a way \"purify\" the European film that has become more and more a blatant copy of Hollywood produced crap. The movie was in every aspect realistic. The acting was natural (I especially liked the excellent acting of Ulrich Thomsen and Paprika Steen), the story was intriguing and escalating until a shocking end. The only location (the Klingenfeldt family mansion) made the atmosphere even more claustrophobic and disturbing. The guests were like trapped inside and were in way forced to witness the fall of the Klingenfeldt family. Anyway, Thomas Vinterberg along with a few other talented directors has brought some freshness into European movie production and will hopefully continue doing so in the future.",

The film immediately gives the impression of having been filmed with a dysfunctional iPhone of the 70s suffering from a perfectible autofocus. This is certainly the expression of Dogme 95, a manifesto of a strong desire of the directors Thomas Vinterberg and Lars von Trier to move away from a cinematographic world they consider too licked, too clean, too artificial, returning to a sobriety more expressive, more original, more formal, with an excessive despoilment of any aesthetic ambition. This impression will last until the last minute. After this rather negative observation, the film is excellent: between the dialogues, the acting and the unfolding of the story, it keeps you out of breath and you will wait for the epilogue with an unbearable impatience.

The finest food is being served along with the finest wine and the party seems perfect.

The actors are all at the top of their game and with a wide array of characters the ensemble is very good - Ulrich Thomsen and Thomas Bo Larsen, in particular, as Helge's sons. All the performances together really come close to creating a very good dose of dramatic tension.The problem is the Dogme style. While it is certainly a good idea to have a \"pure film\" and one that concentrates on story over aesthetics it certainly detracts from the cinematics of the film. The lighting, camera work seem very forced at times just to blindly stick by these rules and don't emit the effect they had potential for in a tense drama like this. \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" had a similar setting - a house - yet the camera was much more cinematic and the drama just as well played and certainly just as intense if not more so.The rules of Dogme are nearly impossible to follow exactly - even admitted by their creators - and I think that is the point. It is the idea that matters and their is still gray space left. No set of rules can be end all be all for anything really, much less something as abstract as film-making. Yet this film still screams 'overkill' with its visual style and that ultimately brings it down a notch. --- 7/10Rated R: adult themes and profanity",

            "review_title": "Vows of Chastity: Alternatives to Hollywood",
            "content": "`Festen,' or `The Celebration' as it is known in the US and UK, is a superb film if you look at it in the right context. Not only is it alternative to typical Hollywood filmmaking in that it is foreign from Denmark and therefore would naturally have its own differences and nuances about it, but that it was shot following a set of standards called the Dogma 95 Rules. In order to fully appreciate `Festen' you must come to understand why these ten rules were set in place and why the director, Thomas Vinterburg, felt it was necessary to film in this precise and odd manner. Otherwise the film may be interpreted as some low-budget independent film with a good plot but highly undeveloped and not entertaining.The Dogma 95 Rules were set in place to restore truth back into the cinema. Nothing could take place that was not actually happening, so that everything the viewer was witnessing, although it may be a story and fiction, was being played out before them. For example, one of the rules states that the film must not contain superficial action. There are no murders that take place in the film because they would not be taking place in real life. Everything the screen shows you is real and therefore truth in its purest form that a fictional movie can offer. There are no illusions taking place- optical work and filters are forbidden. By doing so there is a sense of aesthetic purity in the film. Shooting must be done on location and temporal and geographical alienation are forbidden. The sound must never be produced apart from the images or vice versa. Knowing these rules before viewing the film gives you a certain level of respect for what was being done in the film. `Festen' is focused around the characters and the story, and by using these rules it more clearly sharpens and defines them because all the new technology and sensationalism is washed away and you are able to focus on the purer concepts of the film.`Festen's' biggest fault is that although truth is viewed much clearer through these set of rules, the picture certainly isn't. These rules may seem to draw attention away from the fact that the film looks as though it was shot from a camera bought from Best Buy. It must also be understood that the camera must be hand-held, but any movement or immobility attainable in the hand is permitted. In contrast it's strongest advocate may be the rule that states that the director must not be credited. By not having the director credited alienates almost an director who might want to pursue such a radical project as this because he/she would not get a recognition for the film. At the same time it once again focuses on the film itself and not the fact that there was any production or technology involved in the process or making. It simplistically calls attention only to the actors/characters and what is going on in the film, because according to the Dogma 95 Rules nothing else matters. Therefore, in viewing the film within the context of these rules and understanding that the film is attempting to get back to truth and purity makes viewing it and unique and very enjoyable experience.",

I thought the delivery of this was fantastic and so completely unexpected, perfectly juxtaposed. What I thought was even more interesting was the reaction of the guests.

I think it was well handled and the idea of the father's power over his family and how it is challenged was interesting.  However, the dogme rules of hand held digital cameras and natural lighting hurt this film in my opinion.  Some hand-held shots are fine, a whole movie full of it is just annoying.  I think the good (not great) acting was really compromised by the lack of adequate lighting, giving it almost a Blair Witch feel in some parts, which is no compliment.  As a point of reference, I found myself comparing this film to Pinter's The Homecoming.  They both deal with estranged sons coming home to dysfunctional families (though they differ greatly in how the son confronts the father figure).  They could not be more different though in execution.  In Festen we have the constantly moving camera while in the Homecoming the camera is often static, since it is basically a recording of a stage play.  I thought Homecoming was superior in terms of acting (THAT was great acting!) and cinematography.  Again, I think the dogme rules actually detracted from the performances in Festen.  I would give it a 7 out of 10, mostly for the way the family, immediate and extended, reacts to the confrontation between father and son.",

            "content": "My first thought upon finishing Thomas Vinterberg's Dogma 95 film Festen was, \"Wow, I'm glad my family isn't that messed up!\" In this provocatively honest film, Vinterberg examines the inner workings of a family held together by little more than ties of violence and secrecy. Brought together for the patriarch Helge's 60th birthday, the members of the family find themselves trapped inside the lodge, subject to disturbing revelations about Helge's past made by Christian, the oldest son, who's twin sister has recently committed suicide. Christian accuses Helge of sexually abusing him and his sister during their childhood, and cites this as the reason for her death.Festen is a complex film, its many themes (including abuse, racism, and denial), enhanced by Vinterberg's skillful direction in the Dogma 95 tradition and a cast of talented actors, including Ulrich Thomsen as Christian and Henning Moritzen as Helge. According to Vinterberg, Festen serves as a very obvious metaphor for Danish society, showcasing the Danish people's \"petty-mindedness, claustrophobia, and drinking habits.\" As a member of a foreign audience, that particular aspect of the film was lost on me. From my perspective, the most prevalent theme in Festen is secrecy and deception, which works on many levels throughout the film.The most obvious instance of deception is Helge's image as an upstanding family man. Before Christian reveals the information he possesses about Helge's past, we view the older man in a favorable light. He tells jokes, laughs a lot, and seems to enjoy playing with his young grandchildren. Even after Christian's speech, Helge's reaction is that of a reasonable, kind-hearted father figure. He doesn't blow up or throw Christian out of the house. Instead, pulling his son aside, he says quietly, \"My memory must be failing me. What you talked about. I don't recall it at all.\" This moment is where Vinterberg uses deception at its most sophisticated level in the film: as a viewer, I was unsure whether or not to trust Christian and his allegations. Not only was Helge fooling his entire family; he was fooling me as well. Even Christian seems to become a little confused. After a long pause, he says, \"Sorry, it's probably me who got it wrong,\" and seems to be willing to let the matter drop.In addition to old family secrets, we see deception taking place among the staff of the lodge. Kim, the head chef, grew up with Christian and knows about Helge's abuse. Along with encouraging Christian to stick to his story, he convinces some of the wait staff to go into the guest's rooms and steal their car keys so that the family members will not be able to leave once they hear Christian's allegations towards Helge. He instructs the young waitresses not to tell the older staff what is going on because \"they have pensions to think of.\" One of the most humorous scenes in the film occurs when the guests are attempting to call a taxi service from the front desk of the lodge, and Kim is shown on the other end of the line acting as an answering service informing them that \"the line is busy. There is an eleven-month wait.\" It is not clear whether or not Christian is aware of the steps Kim is taking to ensure that he is able to take action against his father, adding yet another layer to the tapestry of lies woven throughout the film.There are numerous other instances of secrecy throughout in Festen, with each new revelation putting a piece into the puzzle of what really happened years ago during Christian's childhood. During another memorable speech in front of the entire family, Christian reveals that his mother knew about the horrible acts Helge was performing on his children, and did nothing. Later, Helene, Christian's sister, reads a letter written by his late twin explaining why she killed herself, in which she references Helge's abusive nature and confirms Christian's accusations. At this point, Helge has no choice but to own up to his actions and apologize to the entire family, who now view him with contempt.Once all the secrets are revealed, Festen loses much of its energy and ends fairly quickly. The plot is definitely driven by the numerous threads of lies and deception that weave in and out between the characters. Vinterberg kept me continually on my toes as I gathered information from each character and tried to figure out who was really telling the truth. As an examination of a troubled family's difficulty revealing unsavory events that happened long ago, I thought Festen was very successful. Most importantly, I found that the film accurately portrays the discomfort and distress people feel when their illusions about their relatives are shattered, which I think is something that happens to most of us as some point in our lives.",

            "content": "If only one film could be used to argue that courageous and innovative film-making could be used in the service of electrifying and spellbinding entertainment, Celebration would do the trick. Thomas Vinterberg's heinously underhyped film engages in the usual paradox of the Dogme film: that is, by using hand-held cameras, producing sound and picture together, eschewing studio lighting, costuming, music, and in many other ways attempting to strip away the apparatus of artificiality that purportedly stands between a film and its audience, the Dogme films in fact call attention to their own filmic-ness, simply by being outside the parameters that our eyes and ears have been accustomed to translating into a sense of naturalness. No matter how much a Dogme film may actually be akin to the way in which we perceive and experience the immediate physical world, it is the Hollywood style of picture that we are accustomed to process as reality. Certainly Dogme is not the only movement in any medium to have confronted the fact that in art, naturalism is achieved through artifice, while nature reads as artificial. But while the visual presentation of Celebration emphasizes precisely that awareness of the camera it attempts (or pretends to attempt) to negate, this is not what we generally understand as an art film.In a sense, the continuum along which we measure narrative or feature films and experimental or art films is like the continuum on which we situate contemporary fiction and poetry. Both call into play a means (picture and sound, or language) and an end (story, content, argument). Narrative films and fiction tend to employ the means to the end, as is conventional; experimental film or contemporary poetry tend to emphasize the means over the end, or to place the means in the limelight with the end. Naturally, as on any good continuum, there is a middle area where intersection occurs. In Celebration, however, it is the audience who, as a result of its training, emphasizes the means and pays attention to the camera work and other details of the production which the director believes or claims to believe are invisible, or indistinguishable from reality, the lived experience. Celebration gives the story all the attention it deserves, and the plot is the stuff of the most satisfying melodrama.Two twins, one dead by her own hand with rumors of unspeakabilities. A fetching and honest maidservant. A drunken and outrageous brother. A shocking interracial affair! An enduring upstairs-downstairs friendship. Mysterious signs scribbled on the wall, allegations of scandal, rough fondlings, physical violence of every ilk, and the very best wine flowing freely. If it weren't for the extraordinary sensitivity of the actors and their reluctance to roughhouse their parts (which no doubt arises in part from the characters' own reluctance to come to grips with an increasingly unavoidable truth), this would be soap opera at its lurid best. Ulrich Thomsen in the lead role as Christian is stupendous: befuddledly determined, shyly grim, politely and stiffly the right arm of vengeance. Paprika Steen as his sister Helene is another stand-out: weary, blowsy, smoking endless cigarettes with a particular suck-and-exhale technique that gives an instantaneous and tangible knowledge of the dry stickiness of her tongue and the roof of her mouth. She staggers between the moral extremes of hypocrisy and loyalty like a sloppy drunk. And Klaus Bondam, playing the toastmaster at the family reunion, is also impeccable as he doggedly and unthinkably continues with dignified mindlessness to plow through the conventions of the evening in the face of a total familial apocalypse.Celebration, then, is the best kind of old-fashioned entertainment. The manner in which the film is produced may seem artificial in its departure from mainstream techniques, but it is paradoxical not only in the sense that in employing the techniques of naturalism it produces an effect of artificiality. The second paradox of Vinterberg's interpretation of the doctrine of Dogme lies in the fact that this sense of unnaturalness in no way excludes a simultaneous sense of shocking intimacy and immediacy. Close-ups of mouths and eyes twitching, fingers tapping, the quick sounds of glasses clicking and footsteps on dry dirt or leaves, the jolts and trembles of the cameras in the hands of the actors: all these combine to give a dizzying and almost sickening sense of being trapped inside the film, something almost akin to the IMAX experience from which this, at any technical level, could not be more removed.These techniques have parallels in more mainstream cinema, of course. The Blair Witch Project is one example. But while that film was understood to be reality and unmasked as fiction, Celebration is exactly the reverse: the real wolf in sheep's clothing.",

It really dilutes the message i'm afraid.It's clear that Vinterberg and Triers must have talked a lot before Thomas filmed this, and that's not a bad thing at all. Not the most mindblowing movie of all time but a great example of the genre.",

I was surprised that once I'd seen the first 2 scenes I was actually living in the movie... Very rarely - if not never -have i experienced a movie holding so well on to my mind! I simply couldn't (and wouldn't) think about nothing else while watching this movie ... and i felt it in my body several days after! It's like the actors are acting live, as the camera isn't there ....and that fact makes both intimate acting and fast storytelling possible! ...the best movie I've seen in my adult life ....admitting I haven't seen a lot, but claiming I've been selective and only watched serious movies!",

Being credible requires reality. Finding reality - in its purest sense: where the things encountered are things deprived of disguise - in a movie is, in most cases, totally unexpected.Not in The Celebration. From the very beginning to the very end, the characters take you to a stage where all you need is guts to see what is really around you, what really matters in life. And all this beautiful disclosure is the sole product of the actors' meticulous acts of unfolding every little reality atoms. This is perhaps because each and every word, each and every wrinkle has its own story, and significance - or not: just like in life. One of the most challenging tasks would be to decide whether the movie is so credible because the actors are real masters of their vocation or because they do not play, just exist for the sake of pumping your heart, opening your eyes, and making you really happy and sad for being part of reality.In my version, the actors worth mentioning are: the cast, the crew, and digitcam - For they all contributed to the success of the film as much as a human being possibly can.",

In the beginning there are several clues of what's about to happen (e.g. brother and sister touching each other a little too inappropriate). And there's a political angle too with the upstairs/downstairs setting a la Gosford Park. All the names of the two brothers and the living sister have biblical contexts; those of the parents have not.The use of the Dogme-rules do contribute to great intensity, because there are few distractions. There is still room from interesting camera-work from Anthony Dod Mantle, perhaps best known from the von Trier-movies (and the in-jokes about his name).There are moments in the movie when it starts losing its credibility. Guests stay on no matter what happens; their car keys disappear and no one seems to bother. When the racist song starts, Festen goes deliberately over-the-top and from then on resembles sometimes the absurdity of a movie like Le charme discret de la bourgeoisie (a movie where Festen has more overlapping with). It tries to balance a line between drama and absurdity, but there's no bridge between these two (if there ever can be).The plus side is that after seeing this you can easily attend your own family celebrations.

All I can say is that if these films are any kind of representation of Scandinavian film-making, then I'm already hooked.Festen start off as slightly humorous tale of a family gathering to celebrate a 60th birthday party which quickly deteriorates into an incredibly bleak and shocking portrayal of unearthed family secrets. Without spoiling how things play out I can say that a number of bombshells are dropped during toasts at the party which alter how the family is perceived and unravel the fabric of the family forever.The writing is superb (I'll have to assume it is a faithful translation, but I can say that the subtitled dialogue wasn't clunky at all). The direction has a 'home video' quality which I wasn't very keen on at first, but once you're used to it it works quite well for a film that is very much stripped down to the basics of story telling. Lastly the acting is generally excellent, of particular note were the actors playing Christian, Michael and Helge who were all truly great and thoroughly believable. The only performance that didn't work for me was the thankfully brief appearance by the American boyfriend Gbatokai who felt a bit like an amateur actor amongst professionals.This is a truly great film for people who appreciate a simple style of basic film making to try and tell a story with a heavy topic, just through great acting and a great script. However beware of the description of this film as a 'black comedy' which it most certainly isn't for 90% of the film.",

Vinterberg, one of the supporters, has materialized what it declared, congratulations.  With the least technicality to have achieved a complete and good story is an odyssey.  If Hollywood cares to make a replica, welcome, we will have a more refined look of the story. Yet, the flavour would be very different, bloodier and sexier for sure.Most emotionally or physically injured children (by parents of course) would desire to engineer a similar or even more excruciating plot against their \"attackers\" on their birthdays in a confined venue with a big crowd of relatives and friends.  Let them have their celebrations alone on their own like what Helga, the small fascist king in his own house, finally has in hand, abandoned.  Not only the living reciprocate what he has, even the deceased, Linda, speaks through her suicide letter to make allegations of her dad's sexual abuse.Christian just has done what many are cooking up in their retaliatory minds. In actuality, it takes much courage and hatred to tear down all the curtains covering the secrets and scandals of a family plus the daddy's hypocrisy in front of so many familiar faces.  The struggle of Christian is obvious when he goes to his friend, the family chef (Bjarne Henriksen). Pain and pleasure emerge together after his first part of \"success\".  He's got guts to give such a speech, just overwhelmingly powerful and destructive.  No greater destructive power can compare.Interesting the situation appears to be, however, I have not even one single slim of wish to be a guest.  The entire family is skin-deep beautiful with abnormal psychology.  How can I dine at that hall of infamy listening to those nauseatingly true speeches.  Poor guests, nowhere to run.I was watching it with wicked smiles on my face thinking about spiteful plots against those who has done me wrong, not necessarily a family member.

I just do not buy this. If the daughter was so afraid and mad at her dad why didn't she moved out?! There are some other holes in the story as well.

And with all the money they save is that they can fly to all the screening and explain to you why putting 10% effort into their work is art. I would like to suggest one amendment to the dogma95 doctrine: the problem with only using ambient lighting is, as the day gets darker a $800 video camera can't adjust like our eyes can in the real world. The result as the day progresses the film quality gets worse, not exactly a natural effect if you've ever been anywhere at night. Maybe all the d95 directors could get the actors to bring a few lights from home and set them up themselves, then the directors wouldn't have to lift a finger, or spend a penny.

Many viewers were turned off by the shaky home-video approach, but the story itself, the acting and the general feel of the movie made me forget all about the faded visuals, and if you pay attention, the camera captures many details that your 11-year old daughter most likely probably wouldn\u00b4t. A 60th birthday party, shocking revelations and the most dysfunctional family since \"Once Were Warriors\". Henning Moritzen as the father is brilliantly cast against type, Ulrich Thomsen gives an astonishing performance as his son, Christian, but hey...the entire cast is excellent. Unforgettable drama and twisted humor make for a truly riveting experience, admittedly not to everyone\u00b4s taste, but that\u00b4s the thing with all movies, isn\u00b4t it? ***\u00bd",

The whole idea of writing a purist manifesto turned me off to the these movies. Italian neo-realism by Danish guys with camcorders. So I was expecting to hate the Celebration but instead I think its great. When a movie gets hyped like this one or Eyes Wide Shut, then allot of people, understandably, turn off and decide weather they are going to like it or hate it before they even step in the theater. I watched this movie with out thinking about the dogma thing at all and if you watch it that way then it really is very good.  Sure its easy to shock with stories about child molestation but the film that is built around that plot device is well made and it didn't seem to exploit the subject matter cheaply. I thought it provided an entertaining, some times comical character study of family and public humiliation. Gbatokai, the black American boyfriend, was cool and I loved watching him taunt the hothead jerk of a brother. The characters seemed very real and their actions rang true (unlike Mifune in which some character motivation made no sense at all). Iv seen a few films that were made with Hi8. I think its a great democratizing technology (low light shots have an eerie quality) but the transfer to film can be an annoying strain on the eyes. I cant sit through one in a theater but on video its just fine.I know it can be hard to do but try and forget that its a dogma movie or art film or whatever and just approach this film with out any preconceived notions or expectations. You don't get to feel culturally superior by ragging on it after its over but at least you wont feel like you wasted your money.",

For someone who can connect to this movie, it is a roller-coaster of emotions, but in a very cynical way. For those of you that liked this movie, you should also check Nil by Mouth.

            "content": "Thomas Vinterberg's Festen (The Celebration) has the honour of being the first film made and released under the Dogme 95 manifesto. Now that all the hype has died down it's interesting to see what Dogme has done for cinema, and in my opinion, the answer would be very little. This is without a doubt the best of the bunch, because it dares to use the limits of dogme and create a proper narrative story, where as Lars von Trier, with the second Dogme release The Idiots decided he would make a sardonic, black comedy that wanted to shock more than entertain, Vinterberg however, gets the mix of black comedy, great acting and an interesting story just right.Festen takes place over the course of a weekend, where a large group of family and friends have gathered together to celebrate their father's sixtieth birthday. But as the day draws to a close each of the family member's dark secrets begin to come out. At the centre of the action is Christian (played brilliantly by Ulrich Thomsen), a troubled young man, still coming to terms with the death of his twin sister. There is also his brother Michael (Thomas Bo Larson) and his sister Helene (Paprika Steen). Each of them has conflicts that we know will be let loose to the party members by the end of the film, but the stand out is definitely Thomsen.Festen is a very good film, with the first hour being at the 10/10 level of excellence, drawing you into the conflict, making the audience hungry for more, but the films ending just isn't enough to satisfy. It feels as though Vinterberg and his writers have run out of ideas, and the final ten minutes come off as just confusing. But there is still a great deal to enjoy in the film, the cross cutting of scenes is fantastic, and the use of hand-held digital video gives the film a perverse home move feel to it. Plus it's a great opportunity to step back in time to when everyone was still crazy about Dogme, and it's a much more accessible film than the others in the series, namely The Idiots (1998). 8/10",

Incredibly non self-conscious, it is viewed more as a documentary than a work of fiction. The actors and actresses in this film are neither. Maybe it's the language barrier and cinematography, but the performances in this film were exceptional.

And then, out of the blue...BANG ! Something even more gut-wrenching hits you.During most of the film, I was waiting for the situation to totally explode....but it didn't. Everyone just goes on partying, drinking, shoving away the terrible, unspeakable family secret that has been revealed by the eldest son Christian (brilliant performance of Ulrich Thomsen !).\nBut the secret is always there, in his face. And THAT was, for me, the best thing in the entire film ! No hysterical crying from Christian, no over-the-top emotions from a tormented victim.....just that accusing,  still face in the background (you can see the emotional storms raging beneath the surface)while the party and the denial go on.....And finally, when Christian asks his father WHY, the answer felt like a blow in my stomach. \"Because it was the only thing you were good for\"......I rewinded this scene over and over again, just to listen to the actual Danish words. They express so much more emotion than just the subtitles, even when you don't speak the language (which I don't).Anyway, this is a film that you have to see to understand what everyone is talking about. Just rent it, and DON'T let yourself be put off by the sometimes boring scenes. The horrifying stuff that comes next will make it worth every dollar you spent on it !",

An almost voyeuristic peak into the ( titanic understatement coming up...) dysfunctional family headed by patriarch Helge , it is set at the party celebrating his sixtieth birthday. During the first twenty minutes i developed the depressing feeling that it was going to be another predictable film about family bereavement , marked only by a wobbly camera and natural lighting.  I was wrong , a set of horrific , shocking , uncomfortable revelations , and the almost surreal first reactions to them , plunge the hitherto unneventful celebration into the family reunion from hell.  The dogme 95 restrictions give the whole thing the feel of a home video , i almost felt intrusive witnessing these events.  The ending i was impressed with , it's possibly the happiest ending one could expect after the events of this film , but it still felt quite downbeat. All the performances were astounding , usually i find it hard to judge an actor when i am reading subtitles , but in this film the performances were so naturalistic  that i couldn't help but be impressed. I would class this film alongside raging bull and Nil by mouth in that i think it is a great film , yet not entirely pleasurable to watch. A very impressive film. 9/10",

However, camera work still provides various fresh executions such as there is a scene where camera changes its position quickly (pulled from its place in a harsh way so it can be put in its new position) to follow the car which enters the garden behind a wall or there is a scene where camera behaves like a fly, after a flight, resting on a bed for a short time.

It moved something deep inside of me. What Christian is revealing about his family, is so unpleasant and gives an understanding for how terrible a thing incest is. In another comment from 24 April an anonymous wrote that it's terrible, because they make us laugh of incest. I don't know where that idea come from. This movie is funny sometimes, but it's tragic when Christian and his sister are making speeches about incest. I do not think people where laughing there.I have just seen it for the second time, and when Christian is starting to read his green speech my heart started beating faster, because I knew that he was about to reveal something terrible, but I couldn't remember how it went. It was unpleasant and yet fantastic. This is what a movie can do to you when you are living in it instead of just watching it.An important thing to notice is, that this movie is not great because it is a Dogme movie. The story with these actors would always have made a fantastic movie. But I like the shaky camera and what else comes with the Dogme rules. It gives the film an authenticity that makes it even more real. Like someone attending the party where filming.This is my favorite Danish movie, and only a few movies can come close to it.

One by one, we are introduced to members of this atypical but perhaps not-so-abnormal family, who have gathered to celebrate the 60th birthday of the father, a sociable entrepreneur.We learn that Michael, the youngest and the most troubled of the family children, failed to show at a recent funeral in the family, the one for his own sister, for which he makes no attempt even to give excuses. There are a number of eccentric behaviors and enough uncertainties to make us feel uncomfortable, as we are only bystanders listening to pieces of small conversations.  Nonetheless, we see nothing of extraordinary until the eldest son, Christian, decides to drop a bomb shell at the dinner table.We do not know whether we should believe Christian's story; we feel modestly attached to him, but there are indications that Christian may not be completely with himself, for example, he seems to be in a strange relationship with one of the house maids, and the grandfather of the family totally ignores Christian' remarks at the table. In this way, we identify ourselves with numerous guests at the party, who are unable to decide what to do with this new development and whether or not they should change the course of their normal behaviors on this supposed-to-be joyous occasion. The movie is cleverly designed and well executed (e.g. various unconventional camera shots) and succeeds in keeping us in this uncertain, uncomfortable and uncommitted state.Criticisms can be made towards the use of clich\u00e9 tricks, such as spoiled and volatile Michael, who at the end steps up to the challenge, a family chef whom we also find to be a family philosopher and an unwelcome guest from an exotic land with almost supernatural 20/20 insights. These defects, in turn, cast some doubts on real motives of the film makers and makes us wonder whether the serious topic was treated seriously enough. Nonetheless, FESTEN is an original, unconventional and yet very entertaining piece of work. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "Festen opens with a high-speed car race in which three siblings and other party guests are vying to arrive first at a place they all seem to desperately not want to go -- the estate of their father, relative or friend who is celebrating his 60th birthday.Through a series of vignettes following each of the siblings into their respective rooms for the weekend, their personalities are revealed, as well as some underlying information that is looming over the festivities -- the fact that they have recently lost their sister due to suicide.As characters congregate and the movie whirls through various party sequences, the celebration is punctuated by toasts in which one of the siblings brings forth highly incriminating claims against his father. The party tries to cope with this by acting like it didn't happen. Meanwhile, the head of the kitchen staff, who knows the claims to be true, conspires to steal everyone's keys, keeping them locked in the space, forced to confront what's real.After the accusation (and a few follow-ups), there is a lot of work done to preserve the myth of innocence in the family. Possibly the most wrenching depiction of this comes during the matriarch's speech, when she uses a story about the accuser's imagination in childhood to undermine the veracity of his statements, claiming that he has always been unable to distinguish fact from fiction, though she knows he is telling the truth.This movie is not for the faint of heart. It contains at least half of the bad stuff in the world: violence against women, violence in general, rape, harassment, collective and aggressive racism and pedophilia. BUT, it's totally worth watching.",

That sounds like a lovely idea bringing back the same old films we have seen over the years by famed directors, but do we have to crap on Hollywood? They have been giving out some good movies and those that stinks - they're just a movie! Some people actually enjoy these terrible movies. Now for \"Celebration\" - it was a good movie because of its acting, script, dialogue, suspense and mainly the focused story which is unoriginal and cliched. But for the camera style - who said that Hollywood have been doing that poorly? It adds a nice touch, but I would kill myself if I see Chucky the doll discussing his family secrets on a hand held camera! The Dogme films just add to a great list of movies, but please don't expect Hollywood to magically turn all movies into Dogme-type films because I'm sure  that there are so many people that would not like \"Celebration\" because they expect better.

So far, so normal. But it is the execution of this story that is so impressive. Vinterberg pushes the rules of Dogme to its limits e.g hand-held cameras only, so he ties one to a boom. The story, of how people refuse to acknowledge parents abusing their children and how people will move to the crowd (everyone starting to sing the Little Black Sambo song) is portrayed brilliantly, particularly by Ulrich Thomsen, whose introverted performance is the highlight, along with the amazing near-death-experience/dream.The concept of Dogme95, telling realistic stories realistically, is a masterstroke, and this film is the benchmark for experimental filmmaking. I greatly look forward to seeing Idiotern, Mifune and The King Is Alive if they possess this film's sheer genius, insight and admirable lack of respect for convention.",

Besides the wonderful acting and script, I think my favorite aspect of this film is the way it demonstrates the power of denial.  When Christian first announces to all the dinner guests that his father raped him, no one reacts- they all ignore him. Every time he talks about it, the resistance to believe him becomes stronger and eventually results in a great deal of violence. It is very satisfying to see him validated in the end.

It's impossible not to compare Festen with Idioterne by Lars von Trier as von Trier is claimed to be one of the most talented (and indeed the most neurotic) directors in Denmark today, and because both these films are made according to the DOGMA 95-programe von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg has signed.

I watched it for the second time on Saturday afternoon after a fairly boozy Friday night with a friend who hadn't seen it. I found it pretty unbearable at times, as did the friend. Its tension relating to the verbal revelation of unspeakable acts is peculiar to this movie. The closest thing to it would be if Hitchcock had staged a group therapy session. The embarrassment, disbelief, revulsion and denial of the group is palpable to the sucked-in viewer. At times we wish the avenger Christian would just f*** off and let us enjoy the celebration! (As another reviewer said, at times the viewer feels almost intrusive, and by the same token shares the feelings of the group). Strangely, the intensity of its disturbing middle section, with the battle of wills between father and son, is only lightened once the group has been broken down and forced to accept the truth by a memorable missive from beyond the grave. Two performances I haven't seen praised here are that of the chef, a burly bloke who grew up with Christian and is on his side, who helps make the unmasking of Christian's father possible; and the weedy, neurotic-looking man who keeps trying to leave saying, \"I can't take it! I already suffer from depression!\" That might have gone for many in the audience too, if it weren't for something noble about the entire enterprise that keeps you glued to your seat.",

The story, the way the director shows it, the characters and the way the cast play them; are ALWAYS important; either in a low-budget film or in a blockbuster. Otherwise, things like cinematography, soundtrack and modern equipments may increase the greatness of a production. So, I guess these guys missed the point, or also, they were just trying to make people see what's really important in movies' matters.This \"Festen\" has lots of \"amateurisms\": The scenes are sometimes out of focus, the natural light is not always enough, the camera - which according to Dogma 95, must be managed only with the hands - trembles excessively, and things like that. But the storyline involves you and makes you forget these imperfections, what leads us to a paradox. They intended to prove that, as long as the movie has something to say, these imperfections are not important. But the opposite is also true, cause, when seeing \"Festen\", you conclude that the lack of these intentional problems wouldn't affect the quality of the production at all. So, this dogma 95 seems more a protest than some kind of esthetic statement.What about the movie itself? A numerous family is reunited in the patriarch's mansion in order to celebrate his 60th anniversary, but disturbing facts are brought to light with tragic consequences, making you laugh at the same time you get anxious with the tense silence that fills the room.In the end I had to admit: This dogma 95 may be stupid, but gave birth to a great movie.",

I assure you that I have never experienced the grief of the antagonist, nor the suffering and redemption of the protagonist.Its first quality is that it is well written story (it is neither too incredible to be unbelievable, nor too familiar to be dull), secondly the characters are convincingly portrayed (only after watching several times do you realise that the actors react to their every social circumstance, regardless of whether it has been revealed to the audience or not), and thirdly I should mention the unique directorial style. The cameras are all hand-held and the footage is unedited. This may sound pretentious perhaps until you read the Dogma manifesto, written by the director and Lars Von Triers I did not mean for this review to be quite so long winded, however I hope that it is testament to my love of the film.

Unusual but fit to such a story: a family reunited for the sixtieth birthday of the father, having to face its past of pedophilia and the present psychological consequences on the now-grown-up sons and daughters. Interesting is the right word, even though it did not deserve a full ten (I awarded it a 9) because, in my opinion, it suffers from the same problem John Cage's music has: the idea is stronger than the realization, so that what is on the screen is not as valuable as what the director had in his mind.

            "review_title": "Festen's message to the United States",
            "content": "\"The Celebration\"- Not Just for Danes Thomas Vinterberg's \"The Celebration\" was a 1998 Danish film about family and friends coming together for Helge's, a Danish man's, 60th birthday. One of his sons, Christian, revealed to the guests that Helge had sexually abused him and his twin sister when they were young, and that was the reason why his twin had committed suicide. The film realistically portrays contemporary social issues that occur in many western societies and exemplifies common ways that individuals deal or cope with them. Although \"The Celebration\" was Danish, it sends a powerful message to other nations, like the United States. A country's political views and actions shape ideas about topics such as immigration. Verbal, physical, sexual, and substance abuse are all factors that impact familial development. In that sense, this message becomes global. People are social actors, and their social environment shapes who they become. Danish society in the 1990's influenced the messages in this film, but I think it should be also be viewed by Americans to understand their own culture.Alcohol played a role in the film as a source of abuse as well as a source of escape. The entire group consumed alcohol at the party, and they appeared to consume more once everyone began feeling awkward after Christian's story. Christian seemed to have been using the mood-altering drug to manage or numb his bottled emotions. Michael was a perfect example of an alcohol user who became violent and verbally abusive, which we saw during his interactions with Helene's African-American boyfriend. Alcohol consumption is quite popular in Danish society, for in 1994, drawn from a sample of about 2500 males and 2500 females, only 3.2% of Danes 16 years of age and older abstained from alcohol (WHO). Although abstinence in the United States is much higher, statistics have shown high levels of binge drinking (WHO). Alcohol most likely influenced Helge's abusive actions when the children were young.Michael's way of dealing with being raised in a hostile environment was to create one of his own. His father was powerful and showed his power through verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. Michael learned how to be in control by mimicking his father's behavior. Helene's form of escape was to surround herself in a culturally diverse environment and be removed from her family setting. There were glimpses of anxiety as she puffed down cigarettes. Vinterberg strategically tilted the camera for a dysfunctional effect. The long takes, home-video camera, and dull lighting takes the viewer into the story as if they were there. Watching the film makes one feel awkward and uncomfortable because it is so realistic.Verbal and physical abuse targeted Helene's African-American boyfriend. In Buckser's \"Communities of Faith: Sectarianism, Identity, and Social Change on a Danish Island\" (1996), he discussed that Danish identity has been challenged since they joined the European Union in 1972. The globalizing world brought in new people and ideals. One constant Danish trait that has survived has been their language, which could explain why people in the film were upset with Helene's boyfriend who continued to speak English.Immigration and globalization is also a domestic topic of debate in the United States. Although the United States does not have a concrete identity that dates back hundreds of years, there is still tension with immigrants. Both the United States and Denmark have had political parties that had agendas to refuse foreign peoples social rights and services. In the 1980's and 90's, the Yugoslavian Civil War brought many central European immigrants to Scandinavian countries. During that time, there was also a large influx of Muslim immigration. In the 1990's many immigrants, like the Muslims, lived in Muslim enclaves separate from Danish society (Assyrian International News Agency 2010). In 2005, George Bush and Homeland Security began the construction of a multi-billion dollar wall stretching across the Mexican and United States border. The wall was quite a controversial topic, but there were still many people who were supportive. The Danish Progress Party until in the 1990's stated that, \"refugees should not be integrated and only in exceptional cases be granted permanent residence. Access to Danish citizenship should be limited by a quota arrangement, and be given only to people with ability to care for themselves and with sufficient knowledge of Danish language and culture\" (Bjorklund and Anderson 1999). Both countries have dealt and are still dealing with controversy over immigration.Clearly, between alcohol abuse, hostile environment in the family, and tensions of immigration, we can see the similarities of Denmark and the United States of America. These are not just Danish issues. \"The Celebration\" displays these cultural problems in a harsh, yet effective manner. I love its honesty.Sources Assyrian International News Agency, 2010 http://www.aina.org/news/20080718105208.htm Bjorklund, Tor and Jorgen Goul Anderson.

The way the film handles the subject matter of a family dissolving upon the revelation of rape/sexual abuse was darkly comedic.It was incredibly realistic in the way that family members handled the revelation being dropped. In situations like this it's incredibly hard to accept or come to terms with the truth of someone you know being a monster. If you've only had positive experiences with someone of course it's going to be difficult, near impossible to accept that they are actually a horrible person that wounded those around them.The mothers demeanor throughout for my implied a guilt from either blocking these horrible acts the father commits out or accepting and burying them. It visibly breaks her down more and more as her son reaffirms his revelation multiple times and eventually we learn what the daughter that killed herself wrote in a hidden note.It's an uncomfortable movie to be sure, but it tells a heart breaking story unflinchingly.",

I happened to find the film extremely engaging, and was not bothered in the least by the seemingly amateurish cinematography. I detected a false plot note that put a damper on my enthusiasm as the film drew to a close. The father rightly draws the wrath of his sons for his despicable behavior and at the end is shunned by the family at large, finally providing redemption of sorts for his abused twins. However, early on Christian mentioned that his mother knew of the father's transgressions, and even witnessed an event in progress but did nothing. She defended her husband throughout the celebration, tried to deflect all of Christian's comments, and remained in denial throughout. Christian rightly harbored anger and condemnation for her early on, yet there is no closure on such an important issue. Michael's late sudden epiphany and outburst regarding his family's tragic dysfunction should have been directed to her as well, not just his father. She was the knowing yet silent facilitator. Nevertheless, she is allowed to remain seated at the closing breakfast table, and is depicted as almost noble as she rejects her husband's entreaties to come with him, as he is driven from the breakfast room. She too should have apologized to Christian, and should have been sent off in disgrace.",

In so much of the other Dogme-style films that have been made, the narrative has been secondary to stylistic elements or an adherence to the Dogme \"rules\". In \"Festen\", however, the sheer emotional power of the scenario and the accompanying narrative grips you from the get go. The film doesn't allow you to casually sit back and analyze what's going on intellectually (as films like \"The Idiots\" or \"Julien Donkey-boy\" do); it instead forces you to engage with the narrative on a more personal level. You cannot help becoming emotionally involved in what is unfolding in the film and this is what makes seeing \"Festen\" an incredible cinematic experience. This film will make you experience anger, sympathy, disgust and laughter, and will have you cheering for the protagonist. There's not that many films that I find can do that these days and this is what makes \"Festen\" one of the best films of the past 10 years, IMO.",

Thomas Vinterberg here is on the waggon of disturbed Dane Lars Von Trier, who believes, that his only way to big headlines is handheld camera, causing the whole audience to puke from seasickness - OR maybe the dogma-guys have a bet: how far can you go, when you've \"got a name\", before audiences leave the theatre.  -Read - if not familiar already - Hans Christian Andersen's story about the emperor and his invisible, new clothes. Every cinema-owner and -staff takes pride in giving the audiences the best possible show, by constantly upgrading and maintaining expensive equipment, -and for what purpose...? For showing dark pictures out of focus, shot with auntie's old videocamera.....    FESTEN does not cry for the Super Panavison photography of RYAN'S DAUGHTER, but something in between might have done...      The trouble is, that FESTEN during it's first 3 weeks in my little flea circus, have sold about 10 times our total on RYAN'S DAUGHTER --sorry, Mr Lean, -sorry Mr Young...

The  tireless toastmaster, the american who can't understand what is being said and brings Christian to tears, the 'Getting Warmer' game. Channel 4 spoilt it by showing some of the major revelations in an earlier documentary, but it was still horribly engaging and interesting. Also: showing up rich familys to be corrupt and in a worse state than you or I is always amazing to watch.Added to that, the handheld camera didn't stop the film being excellently directed.

Next order of business: if you are at all squeamish about dysfunctional families or psychological (or physical) violence in the movies, stay away. You might see this picture described as being about a family reunion or birthday celebration. Do not go expecting wholesome family fun! Now a word about technique. The movie was shot on video, not film, and the camera movements are, shall we say, liberated. It often swoops about, flying around the action; sometimes does quick pans, like someone watching both sides of a conversation; and occasionally stands still, observing quietly. It virtually becomes another character in the film. I can almost guarantee you've never seen anything like the camera work in this picture.This, along with the quasi-verite style and apparently exclusive use of available light, enhances the believability of the story, and the end result is that there's not a false moment in the picture. I don't even want to get started on the greatness of these performances, because I try to limit the length of my little reviews. It's simply a monumental acting and directing job. Finally, to the story. I can't tell you much without spoiling it for you. I will say that you've never, ever seen family trauma treated in such an honest and unsentimental, yet tremendously powerful fashion. The ebb and flow of confrontation, retreat, and confrontation renewed, are so compelling, so universally human, yet the treatment given is so fresh and vital....well, I just can't say enough, words fail me.

            "content": "Though I know little else of it, the Dogme agreement between several Danish filmmakers requires that movies be shot in natural light, and with handheld cameras. The lighting requirement, only noticeably disappointing once or twice during the movie, seems to mesh will with Vinterberg's general idea of how lighting should set mood. The presence of candles in the movie is not only made more noticeable by this requirement, but the extra attention payed to them is definitely a positive addition regardless of the reason for the attention being paid it. The handheld filming was also beautifully done. The effect of not having a totally steady hand, composed with the odd angles not easily achievable with a full rig and the ever-so-slight hint of the cameraman being slightly affected by the actors' performances combine to place the audience more inside of the movie than one might expect with curious lighting and grainy-seeming film. This is a boon, as the acting was exceptional. Ulrich Thomsen, who plays the protagonist, endured with admirable skill numerous close-ups in which every twitch of every facial muscle was meant to portray the weight of stress and emotion being endured by his character. Thomas Bo Larsen, who played a bit part in \"The Kingdom II,\" another excellent Danish production, really shines out in this movie as well. As full and exciting as it must be to portray a character with serious notable psychological issues, Larsen does not seem to notice that this is a movie. The other actors also did jobs ranging from unnoticeable to excellent, though these two really do stand out as having done a good job. Some loose ends existed in the movie in such a way as to _impose_ disbelief on those already wilfully suspending it, though only in a few select cases. Despite my two subsequent viewings, (The last two 35mm showings to occur, as ours, the last reel in existence) is to be destroyed as soon as Carnegie Mellon returns it to the distributor, I remain unclear on some technical points which do not seem to be intentional. All in all, I would give this movie an 8.5 to 9 out of 10. Not quite perfection, but very well done in almost every possible way.",

It's really the sort of film that needs to be seen twice in order to fully appreciate. The first viewing wraps you up in the plot, of course, while a second go around shows you the tremendous ability of the actors to carry their characters through the story. Ulrich Thomsen drives the movie with his incredible performance and Thomas Bo Larsen does great as well. I can't think of a single actor who gives a bad performance in this film, but those two really make it. I'm a fan of Scandinavian cinema but we don't get too much Danish stuff in the US.

At one time the camera is put down on the ground. According to the rules it should always be handheld. If you watch all of the dogme movies this would probably be the movie where you notice it the least.

By stripping the film of all its cinematic illusions (artificial camera shots, non-diegetic sound, editing tricks, dramatic lighting), the film becomes distilled to its barest essentials, and is therefore all the more evocative. Festen, the first Dogme 95 film, works beautifully in that regard. Vinterberg's claustrophobic study of a family falling apart at a moment when it should be celebrating its solidarity is both emotive and subtle, despite its taboo-inflected plot line. The acting, which, as with most Dogme films, relies heavily on improvising within a set scenario, combined with the hand-held and highly personal cinematography draws the viewer into the microcosm of the family mansion in which the film takes place. The paradoxical ironic detachment Dogme directors speak of when detailing the Manifesto and Vow of Chastity juxtaposes with the austere ethical sincerity with which they produce their films. The end result therefore is a film that is both self-aware and all the more compassionate because of its determination to adhere to its own moral code, something which cannot and never will be said for the amoral tripe regularly regurgitated by Hollywood's hedonistic cash machine.",

            "review_title": "A good Dogma 95 film",
            "content": "WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.I went into this film without knowing much about Vinterberg, Dogma 95, or the film itself. The more I read and learn about all three of these things, the more the movie makes sense. Vinterberg does a great job of capturing the true purpose behind the Dogma 95 commandments. The film is truly a Dogma one, with natural lighting, hand held cameras, a basic set and no clear genre. The actors portray the feeling of the film very well and really embody the characters they play. Vinterberg does a good job of complementing the story line with the Dogma 95 style and portraying themes of relationships and deceit.The film begins with the main character, Christian walking down a dirt road through a field. He is picked up by his crazy brother Michael and brought to a lodge to celebrate their father's 60th birthday. Several other family members, including their sister, Helene, join. We quickly find out that their other sister has recently passed away and learn later that she committed suicide. It goes on to show some of the relationships between different family members and friends, building to the scene where they all sit down for the patriarch's birthday dinner. When Christian, the oldest son, is asked to give a toast, he asks his father to pick between two prepared speeches he holds in his hand. He proceeds to reveal to the whole group that he and his late twin sister were sexually abused by his father as a child. As the film progresses, we find more and more as the family tries to determine who is telling the truth-Helge or Christian. In the end we find that even families that seem fairly normal can have deep, dark, disturbing secrets.The Dogma nature of this film creates a story that seems real, probable, and eerily relatable. Vingerberg uses the commandments to create something that seems incredibly realistic, like the story is being told from the perspective of a home video or a fly on the wall. This \"real-feel\" makes the abuse accusation and discussion painfully realistic. We hear of abuse among celebrity couples, or see it on crime shows on TV or in Hollywood movies. But all these sources glamorize the act and make it seem like something that will never happen to us; something that only happens on TV. In The Celebration, without all the lights, filters and special effects, you get the feeling that you're really sitting in the room, listening to Christian expose the horrible truths of his childhood and his sister's. It's disturbing and powerful in a way that no Hollywood or mainstream film could match. It makes you question what you would do in Christian's situation, in the father's, in the family members'. Vinterberg did a great job of making the style of filming complement the story.Relationships-especially unhealthy ones-are a common theme throughout this film. It is obvious that the relationship between Christian and his father was unhealthy, with the ultimate example being the father's reason for why he abused Christian and his sister. One can infer, however, that the other siblings do not have a great connection with their father either. In the beginning the receptionist at the lodge alluded to some troubles between Michael and his father. Helene also seems to disagree with her father on many points. In addition, Michael and his wife have an extremely toxic relationship. He seems to have no problem degrading her, even in front of the children. The one sex scene in the movie depicts him forcing her to have very rough sex with him. He blames her for everything, including his own clumsiness and irresponsibility. The relationship between Helene and Gbatokai seems alright when it is just the two of them, but the disapproval from Helene's family seems to greatly affect her and cause problems between them. There are very few, if any, positive relationships to look to as role models and this seems to have caused a family full of dysfunctional relationships. This theme follows the Nordic tradition of showing a realistic family where things are not always perfect.Deceit is also a theme in this film. For most of the story line the father maintains that he never abused the children. He managed to keep the abuse hidden from his wife and the rest of the family for much of the children's lives and also maintain a \"good dad\" image. He also denies the abuse to Christian's face. Helge lives a lie throughout most of the film to try to keep up his image. The cook, Kim also seemed to be in on the secret but did not let Helge know that he knew. He continued to serve the father and the rest of as usual until he assists Christian in getting the truth heard. The surviving sister, Helene also keeps her mouth shut and pretends she doesn't know anything for a good portion of the film. When she finds the note hidden by her sister she knows about the abuse. She could have used this information to help Christian earlier on but she pretended to not know anything about it. The truth many of the characters hide is an important and prevalent aspect of the film.The Celebration demonstrates a good use of the Dogma 95 characteristics and relatable themes. Vinterberg created film that even to those who have not been victims of abuse can connect with. The combination of the realistic filming and the real-life problems like unhealthy relationship and deceit make it a film that pulls the viewer into a world that could be his or her own. It is emotional and difficult to watch at times, but the chaos of the story keeps you watching. Overall, it is an interesting story and a good example of the Dogma 95 films.",

At least I didn`t. All the actors are good, but I think that Thomsen and Morritsen stand out, they both use very small means to convey the characters feelings.

Much alcohol is consumed which adds to the tense dinner atmosphere.None more black comedy from those supposed no sense of humour socially stable Scandinavians proving that cultural stereotypes are just that, stereotypes ...and that even the grimmest subject matter can be treated with humour.... anyone fancy a comedy about sectarianism....?Filmed according to the Dogme doctrine, FESTEN is a raw experience that shows that with a good story you don't need any pre production or much post for that matter. The Dogma vow of chastity requires that there should be no music unless it occurs where the scene is being shot, that the camera must be hand held and moving, and that there should be no special lighting. Despite this - or maybe because of it - FESTEN is an emotional family crisis film dealing with love, cruelty and racism and its a must see.You might think that the Dogme restrictions would render FESTEN a bit bleak and amateurish, after all why would filmmakers want to return to these baked beans methods of production. SIMPLE! It works rather than polishing a turd of a story as so many films do. FESTEN is narrative driven and character led. 140 minutes of gripping drama-charming grotesque overbearing that sticks to you like s___ to a blanket.Go and rent it now.",

            "content": "The opening scene of The Celebration sets the tone for the whole movie with the younger brother acting cruelly towards his wife and children and then getting angry at the hotel receptionist. As each character is introduced, we are shown a side of them that implies anger and frustration. Each member of the family has a very different personality and there is tension between each of the characters throughout the movie. The various members of the family are introduced as they are gathering for their father's 60th birthday party. The movie continues by introducing the main plot line and then reiterating the conflicts surrounding this one problem, rather than building on it or introducing other story lines.At the birthday dinner, the eldest brother, Christian, is asked to give a speech for his father's birthday. Through this speech, Christian reveals a family secret and sets the movie in motion; the rest of the movie is spent readdressing this one problem. After the secret is revealed, the guests of the party are convinced that it is not true, and everyone returns to their dinner while Christian leaves. When Christian returns, he is insistent that he is telling the truth and begins to convince some guests of his credibility. Again, he leaves and returns to continue to try to convince others of the truth of his secret. The film continues in this way, with the conflict between Christian and his family. The film does not seem to be going anywhere except back and forth between the two sides of the argument. No one is winning and no one is losing. The movie does not move forward until the very end; and when it does move forward, the movie is over.The camera angles throughout the film add to the drama but also give the movie the feeling of a horror film rather than a drama. The various angles make it seem as though a mass murderer is going to appear out of hiding at any point in time and torture any of the characters around. The movie, however, is far from a horror film and could do without the filming from the upper far corner of a room with a fish eye lens. The quality of the film is also less than desirable and makes it seem like a very old film that was cheaply produced. The movie required hand-held cameras which makes for quick and uneasy movements which add to the feeling of a horror film.The scene with Helene, Christian's sister, in their dead sister's room, when they are playing getting warmer, is perhaps when different camera angles are most utilized and the film has a spooky feeling. During this scene, it almost seems as if the ghost of the dead sister will appear and Helene will be traumatized by seeing her sister's ghost.The movie seems to be documented as a home movie, which creates of feeling of reality. With no special effects or perfect lighting, the movie is simple and believable. The acting adds to the feeling of reality. It is done well with a variety of characters and various personalities. Each of the family members have a large role to fill. They seem to not even be acting; they are just a family with real problems and are allowing someone to film them in their everyday conflicts.The film uses the characters to emphasize gender role stereotypes. Michael dominates and controls his wife, but also has a conflict with Michelle, a waitress, who he has led to believe he will marry and share his wealth with. Christian, Michael, and Helene's father is the main source of conflict in the movie and his wife stands by his side to defend and obey him. She submits to his requests and acts as you would expect a stereotypical wife to act throughout the majority of the movie. When Christian first begins his speech, it is clear that his father knows that his secret is about to be revealed. As all the other guests are laughing, Helge appears nervous and uncomfortable. While Christian is delivering his speech, he attempts to seem lighthearted and jovial and does not want to make anyone uncomfortable. This, however, is not an option and everyone appears immediately shocked. His mother attempts to quiet Christian and defend his father, furthering emphasizing the gender roles seen throughout the film.The Celebration is filmed using only hand held cameras and no artificial lighting. The actors seem to not be acting, but rather living their lives and allowing it to be recorded. This styles allows for the film to seem like a home video in which everything is real and it is easy to enjoy because there are some very relatable aspects throughout the movie. The plot, however, has no depth. After the initial controversy is introduced, nothing is done to deepen the plot or move towards finding a solution.",

            "content": "Pedophelia, sexual abuse, racism and ghosts are all elements interwoven in to the Danish film The Celebration. The Celebration also known by its Danish name, Festen, written by Thomas Vinterberg was my first experience with Dogma 95 style and I must say it was a very refreshing experience. Through the use of the Dogma 95 filming technique the audience is invited to participate in the festivities of a wealthy man's 60th birthday, which quickly take a turn for the worst with the airing of the family's dirty laundry. The camera angles give the film an up close and personal feel as the audience becomes a party guest. The movie was nothing less than an entertaining but perverse emotional roller-coaster ride. Through the entirety of the film we, as the audience, are forced to endure to awkward situations which are created when Thomas Vinterberg capitalizes on the eccentric. The single element of this film that had the most pervasive effect on the audience's emotional response was the filming. The film was shot using a 35mm hand held camera. All light is natural and all sound and music was present during filming. In addition Vinterberg, utilizes the close up and camera angles that beckon us in. In effect these elements bring the audience into the scene providing them with a seat at the party table. Furthermore, when parts of the film are shot in a darkly light room or a room with an odd perspective the audience finds them themselves craning their necks to get the best view. Many examples of this exist in the movie, several of which I will touch upon briefly. The darkness of the filming reflects the darkness of the themes Vinterberg portrays. The overarching theme of the film is sexual abuse. Sexual abuse took precedent when Christian, the eldest son, stands to give a birthday speech for his father. He asks the party guests to choose between two speeches he has written, one a green speech and the other a yellow speech. The chosen green speech is a shock to say the least. Christian tells of the years of sexual abuse he and his sister endured at the hands of his father. This is confounded by the additional confession that the Christian's mother was aware of and even witnessed the abuse. Christian is clearly in a state of shock brought on by the recent suicide of his twin sister, Lene, and as a result is accused of making the story up. Adding to the shock value of the film is the sexual abuse apparent within the confines of marriage. Michael, the youngest brother, demands his wife to have sex with him. Several scenes prior to Christian's exposing speech we watch as the couple engage in a verbally violent disagreement. Post-disagreement Mete reluctantly agrees to \"lay with him\" which in progresses into abusive intercourse. Witnessing this abuse, the audience is left to wonder if this is norm of most Danish relationships is sexual abuse, though I fear this was not Vinterberg's goal. Furthermore this element of the film kept me entranced. Although the subject matter is not lighthearted it is emotional provocative and holds the audiences interest by embracing topics that most films wouldn't dare include. Ignoring cycles of abuse is another theme that Vinterberg exploits. Vinterberg keeps the audience engrossed in the continuous action as another theme, suppression of abuse, emerges. Initially this can be seen as Michael forcibly expels Christian from the dinner party after Christian's second attempt to unveil his father's dirty deeds. When Michael's attempts to silence Christian fail he brings him into the woods and ties him to a tree. This not only demonstrates an attempt by Michael to conceal his father's abuse but it also demonstrates his inability to control his own anger. During these scenes the audience is able to see Vinterberg's unique filming style. He uses close ups of the actors faces which increase our perception of their fear and anger. His lack of artificial lighting leaves some ambiguity as to what actually occurs in the film and makes us feel as if we are hindered by the darkness just as the actors are. Another family secret is revealed when the unsuspecting toastmaster receives a note which Helene requests he read aloud. The note confessed to the entire dinner party that Lene took her own life as a result of the sexual abuse of her father. Though she took her own life one can rightfully say that her presence was felt through the entire film. Vinterberg revives the memory of the Lene in the most intriguing ways. At the beginning of the film the audience knows very little about the status of the Lene until, Helene is tempted into child's play with her. Through this slightly unsettling game of hid and seek Helene finds her sisters suicide note. Though it may seem to the audience that Lene has served her purpose in the film she has not. The film could not be complete without an added element of confusion when Christian, in a drunken stupor, converses with Lene in what seems to be a dream or hallucination. He is then pulled from hallucinations by the ringing of his phone. When he stands to answer the phone we find that he is lying in bed with Pia, one of the house staff and a past lover. The continued relation with Lene confuses the audience and makes thin the line between reality and spirituality. In summary, Vinterberg proves to us that a movie can be captivating, engaging and even stunning using the bare minimum of filming resources. This film is contrary, in every way, to Hollywood films but it is still successful. Its success hinges on the realistic filming through low lighting and hand-held camera styles in addition to the connection we feel with characters and their dire situations.",

            "review_title": "The Celebration truly captures the essence of a dysfunctional family",
            "content": "The first Dogme 95 movie captures what a dysfunctional family really is with only a hand-held camera. Hollywood's idea of a dysfunctional family is Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt, two very successful parents, raising twelve children. In a movie like Cheaper by the Dozen, we do not feel the slightest bit sorry for the neglected youngest child. In contrast, Vinterberg is able to bring the audience into his movie and feel the raw emotion. Vinterberg captures this through his new artistic Dogme elements along with his remarkable cast. These stand out cast members play the roles of Christian (Ulrich Thomsen), the successful restaurateur whose twin sister recently committed suicide; Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen), the short-fused son with a bitter wife; and Helene (Paprika Steen), the rebellious daughter.The family is gathering for Helge's 60th birthday at the hotel. He is accompanied by his wife Elsa, his daughter Helene, and his two sons Michael and Christian, among others. All of the children begin to arrive and get comfortable in their rooms. Helene is far from comfortable when she begins to unpack in her deceased sister's room where she finds a suicide note, but decides to keep it to herself. At dinner, Christian accuses his father of raping him and his deceased sister, Linda. The family gathering continues to heat up for the duration of the movie. During Christian's toast at the celebration dinner he reveals that his father sexually abused him and his sister. The family reacts by merely ignoring and telling him that this is absurd. Vinterberg's brilliance is portrayed by his ability to keep the viewer attached to Christian and concerned while we do not know if this accusation had really occurred in his childhood. Instead we are left contemplating, as if we were sitting in the very dinning room they were, like the rest of the family. We are hammered with the statement, \"Here is to the man who killed my sister.\" The rules (Vow of Chastity) that make Dogme 95 what it is are the sole reason for the deep emotional connection that the viewer feels. The hand-held camera is used in artistic ways that serve different purposes throughout the movie. Most often the viewers are allowed to feel like they are a part of the scene due to the placement and movement of the camera. The use of the camera is also used to show the different personalities of the main characters. The movie begins with Christian in the distance walking towards the camera. Immediately, the viewer sees this character as enigmatic, and after his confession his story remains a puzzle until the very end. You feel Helene's sense of importance to the family when we witness her taxi ride to the party. The camera makes it seem as if you were sticking your head out the window as the driver weaves in and out of the lane to get to the party. Vinterberg's clever camera use also exemplifies the obscurity of the dead sister Linda. The camera carefully follows the signs and gives us an impression that she may be their haunting the room Helene is residing in. Lastly, the constant quivering of the camera exemplified the uneasiness that all the family members were feeling as they anxiously tried to leave. Even if the viewer's stomach does not agree with this trembling camera, I feel that Vinterberg is still able to depict the intense emotion and suspense.The next important element of the way that Vinterberg captures this family catastrophe is the lighting. Dogme 95 requires that the film does not use special lighting. Only criticized for breaking this rule once in The Celebration for covering a window, Vinterberg truly captures the mood through the use of natural lighting. The beginning of the movie begins in the mid-afternoon on a beautiful day. It was portrayed that most everyone was arriving putting on a content face to make the day for Helge. As the hours pass by the natural dark lighting accurately brings out the gloomy and sinister mood that has come to pass because of the alleged abuse and secrecy of the deceased sister. As the celebration drags into the night the camera is grainy and dark, but Vinterberg is still able to hold onto his crowd until the end. We are still entangled by the mystery that little tricks like these may go easily unobserved by viewers.One element that does not make sense to me is the title that Vinterberg chose for this movie. When someone thinks of a celebration, the first thing to come to mind is happiness. From the very beginning we get the feeling that this may not be a very pleasant birthday celebration. It also seems that there is an underlying tone of irony. Christian makes a serious accusation towards his father, and Vinterberg is trying to make a play for some laughs. This is not kind of humor that a westerner like me would understand. Therefore, I still stand questioning the title and sense of humor Vinterberg uses.Vinterberg was recently interviewed in Rome saying, \"I like to be on thin ice\", and this was definitely the case in his conception of the first Dogme movie. As an American, I would not typically choose to watch a film like this one, but Vinterberg has given me the opportunity to witness a piece of art through a low budget film produced with a simple hand-held camera. For once, I was able to experience strong emotional empathy for the characters in the movie. The screenplay is written so well that I can appreciate it regardless of the fact that I am not familiar with the language or the actors. The Dogme 95 rules create an effect that makes the viewer feel like they are there with the characters. No matter what, Vinterberg has your attention until the final minute of this movie.",

            "content": "If you're ever feeling like your family might been a little quirky, just take a couple hours out of your day, watch this Dogma film and you will feel at ease about your family. Thomas Vinterberg delves into a story of a dysfunctional family with an unforeseen secret that has remained buried, which may have been for the best. Coming together for the seemingly honorable Helge, played by Henning Moritzen, a little known family secret is let out of the bag by his son Christian, played by Ulrich Thomsen, which ultimately led to Christian's sister's suicide.The first Dogma film ever created has left its mark on the Danish film industry. Festen is an intricate film, intertwining various themes such as concealment, abuse, and racism into one ball of entertainment. Vinterberg also intends to use the film as a symbol of Danish society, portraying their drinking habits and feelings towards immigration. This symbolism was not very apparent to me as an American viewer however. He probes an awkward subject and manages to turn it into an award winning film.The main theme depicted in this film is that of concealment. Helge is a well respected man and held in high regards by my peers and family. Our first few glimpses of Helge are of him laughing and playing with his grandchildren, seemingly enjoying himself as well as others enjoying him. As the movie progresses, the secret is revealed by Christian but it is not immediately known whether Christian is fibbing or not. The family doesn't have a strong response as I expected, rather the scene just sort of progresses. Helge even seems to convince Christian this was all fashioned in his own head when he tells Christian, \"I'm sorry but my memory must have slipped me because I do not remember this.\" Christian seemingly takes the bait when he claims he \"probably got it all wrong.\" The theme is full force here, as it seems that neither actors nor the audience know what it is true and what is not.Vinterberg furthers this theme in the movie when one of Christian's life long friends, Kim-played by Bjarne Henriksen, on staff at the lodge elects to retrieve and hide all of the guests keys just prior to Christian's unveiling of his father's true past. It is never really clear whether or not Christian knows about Kim's attempt to help Christian get his story across. We later see more secretive action when it is revealed that Christian's mother, Else-played by Birthe Neumann, knew of Helge's actions, yet did nothing to stop him. I got the impression that the suicide of the one daughter was seemingly forgotten when we see Christian's second sister, Helene-played by Paprika Steen, going to her room and saying \"it is one thing not to talk about it, but another just to cover it up.\" Also prevalent throughout the film was the noticeable abusive relationships held by some characters. I do not want to go in to too much detail and ruin the film, but on multiple occasions we see various forms of abuse. Such as when the guests are first arriving and getting into their rooms, we see Michael, played by Thomas Bo Larsen, and his wife Mette, played by Helle Dolleris, arguing over a pair of missing shoes. Michael gets upset with Mette because she forgot to bring his \"good\" shoes and a rather loud verbal dispute arises between the two. We see these two fighting again when Michael is in the shower and slips. He gets infuriated, claiming she left the soap on the floor, when actually there might have been some outside forces in play there. We continue to see little tidbits of abuse, at one point Helene and Michael get into an argument in which Helene calls Michael a \"nazi bastard.\" The metaphor of Danish society and their feelings towards immigration brings some abuse with it, mainly when the entire family sings a racist song with a black man present. Although it is in a different language, Helene tells him the nature of the song so he's not left in the dark (that was not a play on his skin color).Though there are numerous other occasions involving abuse, I will not go into it too much and ruin the movie. The continued abuse and concealment are intermingled throughout the movie. Some secrets have caused abuse, while some abuse has caused secrets. Vinterberg keeps you engaged throughout, wondering what twist he will throw at you next. I think he chose a subject, family troubles, that most everyone can relate to, although maybe not specifically, and creates a successful film. The characters in this film did a great job of wearing their emotions, making the language barrier not that big a deal.",

It is also about revelation, dark secrets, and the sinister side of family life, the sorts of things not usually associated with celebration. As such it is a movie not recommended for those who have triggers.Thomas Vinterberg, the co-founder of the Dogme 95 avant-garde filmmaking movement, uses a very distinct cinematography in The Celebration. The point of Dogme films was to forego the use of special effects and anything too technological, eliminating every bit of film equipment but cheap, hand-held cameras. As you may expect, this gives the film a very distinctive feel about it, as well a distinctive story-telling pattern.If Vinterberg aimed to mimic a home-video style in this film, then it was not especially successful. It is an interesting an artistic style, but it is just that\u2014the audience is not going to believe that there is a character running around filming all of the events of movie because of the nature of some of the events. That said, what Vinterberg manages to create with rudimentary hand-held video cameras is truly stunning. There are a lot of jerky shots and scenes, with some scenes having a distinctly amateur feel to them, but it is obvious that a lot of thought is put into each scene. Though the movie does an obviously dated look about it, being filmed in 1998. There is also a rogue brick-sized mobile, if anyone was in doubt of the film's era.Because of the Dogme movement's vow to stick to the basic values of acting, themes, storytelling, and theatre, it takes a strong cast of characters to keep the movie afloat. And here Vinterberg certainly delivers, with some of characters coming across so strong they flirt with soap opera territory. There is of course the rich father who seems like a harmless, benign patriarch, a passive, prim matriarch, the prodigal son, the passed away sibling whose absence is just as strong as any character's presence, the fighting couple, the foreigner with the good morals, and so on. Each character has a role to play, even if it is just to help highlight how messed up the family truly is.And the family itself is quite a character\u2014this family's gathering in a European hunting lodge for a 60th birthday may not seem like a relatable experience, but the relationships and interactions between the characters are sure to dredge up uncomfortable feelings, memories, and associates in the audience. Everyone has had those uncomfortable family reunions. Perhaps because the film is drawing on these universal experiences, there is a very definite tense atmosphere about the movie before any major revelations. Of course the sister's suicide\u2014in that very building\u2014is hanging over the party, but that is not the main reason the audience is so tense. The short of it is that Vinterberg can work some amazing magic to create such a strong atmosphere with such minimal obvious effort.It is not a horror movie, but The Celebration could certainly be in the running for one of the most anxiety-inducing movies I've seen. One simply can't shake the feeling that something terrible is going to happen, and it doesn't seem like it is going to be anything less than a murder.There is no murdering going on to speak of, but there is a panoply of other uncomfortable, disturbing issues both floating around and at the centre of the film. Typical of a Nordic film, The Celebration does not balk at the idea of getting dirty and gritty, exposing some of the most dark behaviour humans are capable of. Equally adding to the disturbing atmosphere is the family's reaction.When Christian (Ulrich Thomsen) gives a speech to his father and reveals that he and his twin sister were raped, the family is quiet and a tad uncomfortable\u2014but tittering. Then when he brings it up a second time, he is assaulted, dragged out of the lodge, and left in a forest bound to a tree. Instead of outrage at the father, the family directs its outrage at Christian, who has a history of being unstable. Which, of course, would make sense with his traumatic childhood experiences. To make it worse, he reveals that his mother walked in on what he was doing to him and his sister, but she did nothing to stop it.One more highly uncomfortable scene is when the family also sings a racist Danish song in front of Gbatokai, the black boyfriend of Christian's living sister Helene. This is not a healthy family by any means; it is reinforced how much this family can do, especially when it is removed from the eyes of the rest of society. One gets the suspicion, also that Vinterberg, is trying to at least hint at something present in Danish culture. Racism is not unique to Denmark by any means but, for a western European country, it is remarkably unabashed about it. It is an issue still today, as evinced by Denmark's current issues with its immigration policies being too conservative and constraining in comparison to EU standards.This socially unacceptable behaviour by the family within its own territory is one of the things that adds to the film's feeling of seclusion, and claustrophobia. Out in the country among itself, the family becomes its own small community. This feeling is also further enhanced by car keys being stolen, so that no-one can leave, and everyone literally is stuck with their family. Due to a lack of mobile phones only the concierge can call out for cabs, and he's been paid not to. Thus the feeling of isolation is complete and successful.The Celebration was nominated for, among other things, a Golden Globe. It won the Best Foreign Language film New York Film Critics Circle Award, as well 23 different international film festival awards.",

How can people complain about the bad quality, about the bad photography, saying a kid could shoot it better? Of course it's not quite Lars Von Trier, and at times the camera is trying too hard to be oh so special to the point that it looks forced. But overall it's well done. I must the idea of Dogma rules doesn't appeal to me, as I'm against rules in art. It's rather silly. But as long as I enjoy the result - does it really matter? The most unique thing in this film, is the fact that it makes fun of all these taboos, which is a taboo itself. This is a comedy, you laugh through this film, it doesn't really upset you. But than there's the ending, which I must say was the only thing that truly disappointed me. I just don't like happy endings I guess, and this one seemed especially fake - and after all that wonderful bitter sarcasm!",

I thank the writer and producer of the film for touching people in a way where the reality of this abuse is exposed. I also feel it is good film to give to friends and supportive people who are helping a loved one who has survived this and is healing.

            "review_title": "Good Film.....In a Disturbing Sort of Way",
            "content": "For starters, the Celebration is definitely not a \"feel good\" kind of film, and it is certainly not a celebration. In fact, there are many points throughout the film that made me very uncomfortable. The film is very dark and has a very eerie feeling to it. The Celebration explores the interesting relationships of a very dysfunctional family. While gathering to celebrate Helge's 60th birthday some very dark and disturbing secrets are exposed that put quite the uncomfortable twist on the party. None of the characters in the film really come off as \"likeable\" and most of the scenes have sort of a dark/haunting feeling to them. It is not the easiest film to watch. With that being said, it is a very powerful film that will have your attention from start to finish. The movie starts off by introducing us to Christian and Michael, two brothers on their way to their father's 60th birthday party. Right off the bat we get a peek into how unlikable Michael's character is when he forces his wife and children to walk the last few miles to the house. As the movie progresses Michael's character shows more and more flaws and doesn't win anyone over. Christian, on the other hand, is a tough character to read. He's very quiet and does't show a whole lot of emotion (at least right away). He seems to be the one who has it all together, but we later find out that he's got a dark secret that is haunting him. After revealing his startling secret during his \"toast\" to his father, Christian puts a very emotional twist on the dinner party which puts a great deal of strain/tension on just about every relationship in the family. Even after everything is \"worked out\" you get the sense that this family will never gather together again, which leaves an uncomfortable/unsatisfying taste in your mouth. I believe that it was the filmmaker's intention to expose the flaws of all the characters to show the audience that this was a very real story. There is no Hollywood type of hero in this film who comes and saves the day. The unlikable characters are something to watch for in this film. One other interesting dynamic of this film is that we don't really know who knows what, or how they know it. For example, Michael seems to believe that Christian is making up his story right away, but at the end you get the feeling, while Michael is beating his father, that he may have known about it all along and was helping to keep it a secret. Another interesting relationship is that of Christian and Ken, the cook. It seems as if they had planned all along to reveal this secret in front of the whole family, but it was hard to tell if Christian and Ken liked each other, what exactly Ken knew, or how he knew it. All we know for sure is that Ken was involved in taking everyone's car keys so that they couldn't leave until they heard the truth, so he seemed to know something about Christian's secret. It was also hard to tell if Christian's sister, Helene, knew about his secret. When he was giving his toast Helene had a look of fear on her face like she knew what was coming. However, we don't know if she knew of this secret all along or if she just found out about it after reading the letter she found. Also, Helge's wife defended her husband up until he finally admitted to abusing his children, and then it seemed like she wanted nothing to do with him after he admitted to it. What is strange is that she, according to Christian, witnessed the abuse first hand in 1974. So she was either in denial the whole time, she was just protecting her husband, or Christian made that story up. We never really find out what she knew or why she defended Helge so much. This film leaves you with a lot of unanswered questions and leaves it up to your imagination to decide what happened. This was my first Dogma 95 film, and I have to say that I am not sold on this style just yet. For me, the lack of lighting or props wasn't a huge deal (although the lack of lighting did contribute to films overall haunting feeling), but the use of the hand-held camera didn't do it for me. I will say that I did get used to it as the movie progressed (it really annoyed me at first), but I still didn't particularly care for it. It just seemed a little strange to have all of these very powerful and emotional scenes that were shot with unfocused/unsteady cameras. It was a little distracting to me, and I think that it actually took away from some of the emotion of the film. However, I do think that, in a documentary sort of way, the use of hand-held cameras makes the film feel a little more \"real,\" but one thing that annoyed me with this film was the very unreal fight scenes. They couldn't have looked more fake, and they were just about the only comedic value the film offered. Overall I think that the dogma style did, in some ways, enhance the film from an emotional standpoint. However, I believe that with this storyline already filled with tons of emotion, a little more production value may have helped. Conclusion: The Celebration is a good film and is worth watching, however, you may only want to watch it once because it will leave you with an uncomfortable feeling.",

            "content": "Dunno if this is really a spoiler, but whatever.I really liked this movie for the camera work that was put into it, having scenes of aggression, or even just the parts with people working being slightly choppy, and fast moving with the frame rate being 24fps(I'm not quite sure if that's right or not). The Dogma rules that where followed made the film feel very unique(and I thought worked extremely well) in that the peoples lives were so shaky, and the camera never sitting on a tripod(constantly moving, even slight twitches here and there). The wide angle at the beginning(Christian walking down the road on a cell phone) and in the forest when they're tying Christian to the tree was a little strange to me though. Maybe just a little unusual, because I've only seen those used in skate video's, so it may just be me. When I say their lives are shaky I'm referring to the fact that abuse was very present in the film. The main character's brother was abusive, and lost his mind every once in a while. This guy was weird! He would pinch his sister in places that are not at all proper to touch anyone. Like when he and she were waiting outside for the guests to come. Very bizarre character. Nobody really had a secure life, either that or they had a past that was being brought out that was very painful. Scars that haven't healed are very painful to rip open. This of course made the film feel very uneasy, but interesting.I am very bothered that they showed the brother having sex with his wife. I really don't think that they needed to show that. They could have hinted at it, and then moved on. I would say that it made the brother, and the entire family feel more perverted. This is a plus since the films objective seems to be to bring out the strange perversion/abusive nature that this family has. Still, they didn't need to show it-the film would be fine without sex, or showing nudity. Maybe inter-cut the scenes of the sister and her friend searching the room with Christian's girlfriend in the bath(Without showing her boobies) with something else. Who knows, since they had something happen in all the rooms at the same time, the could have had some other event happening, and something happens there.",

            "content": "*CONTAINS SPOILER*Denying the past sometimes seems like the easiest option; but holding on to a painful past can hold you back from fully enjoying the present. Only by accepting the past can you truly be free to embrace your life and move forward. Winner of the Jury's Special Award, The Celebration tells the tale of a son sharing unpleasant family truths at his father's, Helge's, 60th birthday and their journey with abuse and denial. The Celebration (Festen) looks at the influence of abuse and denial, and how a family can overcome their painful past. A wealthy Danish family gathers for the celebration of the father's birthday and get so much more than they could have imagined. The father asks his oldest son Christian to share a few words about his recently deceased daughter Linda- Christian's twin sister. To the father's surprise Christian has already prepared a speech to reveal the truth about the father's abusive relationship with Christian and Linda. Denial plays a prominent role throughout the film as the family slowly begins to accept the truth they had been ignoring for many years. The Celebration (Festen), directed by Thomas Vinterberg, was an instant hit when it was released in 1998 under the rules of Dogma 95. Festen is the first film to delve into the rules of Dogma 95 and create a counter-mainstream film. The Vow of Chastity sets up the rules of Dogma 95 and includes that filming must take place on location with a hand-held camera and no special effects or unrealistic actions are allowed. Through these rules, a realistic innocence is created, allowing for an authentic experience for the audience. As innovative and refreshingly unique this technique is, it is also distracting. The occasional blurry scenes make it hard to see what is happening and makes the film appear to be of low quality. Furthermore, there were some scenes that were extremely choppy and made it hard to focus on what was happening as I felt like the camera was being tossed around. I feel that the quality could have been better, even with a hand-held camera. During the scene at the beginning where the family is arriving, the camera jumps around in a haphazard manner that gives the scene a chaotic feel and it was difficult to understand and see what was occurring. Overall I appreciated the Dogma 95 feel but did not enjoy the low quality. The main character Christian depicts the struggles and torment that occurs from sexual abuse. As children, Christian and Linda were raped by their father, Helge. The scars of this abuse are still evident in his adulthood through the speech and his intimate relationships, or lack of. For Christian, revealing the truth is met with denial. But with the support of his friend chef Kim, and the other staff, Christian and his family begin to deal with their painful past and current reality. Throughout the movie you see the slow transformation that takes place through the acceptance of the truth. At first no one wanted to accept the horrid truth and felt it would be easier if they continued to ignore it. But the final acceptance brings the siblings closer and mends their relationships. Moreover, the past abuse has a great affect on Christian's intimate relationships with women. Pia, a maid, tries to offer herself to Christian, but he simply ignores her actions. He is not interested in having any relations with her until the end when the abuse has been accepted. Christian is finally able to move on and have a relationship with Pia. The younger brother, Michael especially struggles with the denial of his father's abuse. At first he tries to get rid of Christian and ignores Gbatokai's attempts to console him. He also takes out his frustration and confusion on Gbatokai by starting the singing of a racist song. Finally after Helene, the youngest sister, reads the letter from Linda, Michael is forced to confront the problem and he begins the process by beating up his dad. But by the morning he is able to respectfully and calmly ask his father to leave. The theme of abuse is also evident in Michael's relationship with his wife Mette. Verbally and physically, Michael hurts his wife. We first see this in the car on the way to the party as they are yelling at each other and as he makes Mette and the kids walk all the way to the party. In addition, Michael engages in abusive sexual behavior with his wife. Michaels's abusive behavior, along with his infidelity, is evident throughout the movie and you can see the pain it causes Mette yet her unfailing devotion to him. It was frustrating to watch her continuously put up with him but I am sure there are many viewers who can sadly relate to her trials.In conclusion, The Celebration is the first of the Dogma 95 films and uses innovative techniques such as hand-held cameras and no special effects to simplify the filming. It creates a unique experience for the audience and gives it a realistic feeling. The Celebration depicts a Danish family as they try to deal with the painful truth of abuse and overcome denial. The themes of denial and abuse form the storyline. Through the celebration of his father's birthday, Christian is able to overcome the painful past of sexual abuse and move past his issues of intimacy. Furthermore, Michael struggles with the harsh reality of the past but is finally able to be freed and grow closer to his siblings. Through revealing the past, the family is set free to embrace their past and enjoy the present. Overall it was an emotional and well-done film. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a touching film that challenges and stretches us to see what parts of our past we have yet to embrace.",

            "review_title": "A disturbing film on the duality of humanity",
            "content": "\"Here's to the man, (my father) who killed my sister...to a murderer.\" This film does an incredible job at getting into the depths and complexity of real relationships. Having to feel so uncomfortable at the realities of their relationships while watching the film was very powerful in that it elicited inspection into each main character. One of the real strengths of this film is its ability to push past characters with stock emotions to truly explore the duality present within relationships. The Celebration tells of a family celebrating Helge's sixtieth birthday. His children, Christian, Helene, and Michael gather together along with many other distinguished guests. Despite the initial merriment, Christian's first toast threatens to shake up the entire family. His accusations of rape forces the family to deal with the past.As a viewer I was fascinated by the emotions explored in the film. It successfully presented many emotions that were clearly distinct in and of themselves. What made the film engaging and realistic was that multiple personalities were present in each character. The interaction was done in such a way that it didn't slip into confusing characters, but rather ones that invited contemplation. One character that highlights the effects of a mixture of love and hate in this intriguing way is Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen). During the opening scene of the film, Michael kicks his wife and children out of his car on the side of the road in order to drive another adult man. They are left to walk the rest of the long walk on their own. Soon after, we witness a fight between Michel and his wife. During the fight he explodes, thoroughly destroying the room. His rage is also evident as scenes depict him beating his past mistress, Christian, and his father at three separate times within the night. This type of forceful reaction and lack of concern for his family is absurd. Interestingly, although Michael is clearly portrayed as the most violent character of the film, he also is involved in the only consensual sex scene in the movie. Also, he spends almost the entirety of the movie fighting on the side of the revealed sexual abuser by abusing Christina. Finally at the very end of the film he fully understands the situation, and combats the abuser for the victim. Having so many examples of the negative qualities of Michael and then showing a switch successfully invites the audience to further contemplation of the real nature and duality of humanity, which is neither fully good nor fully evil.Another expression of duality that prompts contemplation is Helge's (Henning Moritzen) relationship with Christian. The mixing of traditional perceptions of fathers and rapists leads to a very uncomfortable and disturbing situation for the viewer. At the beginning of the film he is presented as a successful and well-liked businessman with many friends coming for his party. The party starts out filled with hugs and joyful exclamations. Soon after Christian begins his first speech though, Helge's perfect image is shaken. It's especially fascinating that Christian's speech comes as at least some degree of surprise to the audience. There are hints before that something in Christian and Helge's relationship is not a good one, and yet I was not expecting Christian to reveal rape. I was quite surprised at how quickly my perception of each character changed so quickly. It was done in such a way that it was believable, and not just a random plot twist that seemed to come out of nowhere. It is especially interesting that this concept is not introduced immediately in the film. Instead, there is time to develop him as the well-liked man. Even Christian's speech doesn't begin as it is indicative of something so horrid as he is smiling and appears to be honoring his father. In reality, the story is about to take a very clear plot turn. Also, it is interesting that although Michael accuses his father of abuse, there is an element of questioning the reality by the other cast members and Christian's recanting initially. I found myself initially emotionally connecting with Christian, and yet being slightly drawn away by the other guest's interactions. The ability of the writers and actors to make me question reality without getting lost from the emotions was powerful. This interplay keeps the audience engaged, trying to delve deeper into their relationship to understand its complex nature. The juxtaposition of their relationship that illustrates a mixing of roles was well done. Other techniques that were used to accomplish illustrating the duality between illusion and reality were the filming and artistic techniques.The film was filmed in the style known as Dogme 95, which began in 1995 in Copenhagen. In order to promote \"cinema of the moment\" the film was entirely shot on location, without makeup, and had no fixed cameras. The beginning of the film shows rolling hills and a beautiful countryside. As the film progresses to the scenes in the bathroom and at the dinner table though, freehand cameras shot the camera footage so it became shakier as the characters engaged in more physical movement. This style ends up inevitably shaky and comes off as very raw. This goes a long way to complimenting and cuing the mood of the film for the audience. The emotions of bitterness, anger, and chaos come though as so raw and exposed that as an audience member, we are forced to confront these challenging emotions. Overall I wouldn't say that I emotionally liked the film. It was disturbing and challenging, and yet this is exactly the intent of the film. It does this quite well and I was fascinated by the contemplations I had as a result. I would recommend the film if you can handle its mature themes and also have the time to truly engage with the film. Although it isn't a feel-good film, the raw and explorative qualities into humanity is powerful and thought provoking.",

            "content": "Many films are made to bring the audience to a separate reality, an escape from their everyday life. Some succeed and some do not; what is hard to find is a film like The Celebration, a film that transports you into a family and lets you bear witness to the collapse of all order as if you were truly there. This feeling is brought about because the movie was filmed in the Dogma fashion, leading at times to a seemingly shoddy production value but none-the-less a very distinct and powerful atmosphere. This method creates a feeling of true reality, for example, if you were outside at night it would be difficult to see clearly without lights, which is accurately represented in the film when Christian is tied to a tree in the forest and we can see barely more than his silhouette. Standard cinematography practices that you find in mainstream movies are also absent; there are no aerial camera shots, no zooming and fading, practices easily observed in a Hollywood movie. Instead, all filming is done by a hand-held camera, held by someone on the ground, moving with the actors when necessary, creating a feeling as though your eyes are those of the camera's, truly making you feel as part of the story. Do not expect to be happy anytime during your time watching the film, the subject matter and its presentation do not allow such a luxury. Rather, expect to feel torn, twisted and perhaps very sad; this is not an easy film to watch. The Celebration does not shy away from mature subject matter and what the movie depicts and creates is very real. Centered on the celebration of the father's sixtieth birthday we watch as an occasion of joy turns into one about sorrow and tormented pasts. Following the recent suicide of the oldest daughter, the family is looking to ease some painful memories by having a fun night, however this is not possible. Asked by his father to say a few words about his sister's passing, Christian, who is notably suffering from it, decides that this is the occasion to bring to light the past torment that he and his sister suffered from their father. The night descends into chaos from the moment of Christian's speech onward. There are really two characters that stand out in the movie, Christian and his brother Michael. Christian is obviously troubled and has suffered a long time with the memories of his childhood. He lives in France, away from his family, perhaps for those very reasons. He could be living there as an escape, trying to live a different life, with his past locked up inside. Ulrich Thomsen does a phenomenal job acting out this role. He truly makes the character feel as if all of a sudden he is releasing all these pent up secrets and is going to do so no matter the cost. His facial expressions, or lack thereof, really say a lot about the character. Christian is emotionally damaged and he has finally come to a point or occasion where he feels the need to share the reality of his dark childhood. Christian's younger brother Michael is the other standout character in the film. He has spent his life trying to live up to his father's wishes and expectations but would not necessarily be considered a decent person. He has several demons of his own that he seems unconcerned with but which add great depth to his character. Michael is not a good husband. He treats his wife poorly, seeing her more as a house and child caretaker than as someone he loves. Michael is also a racist. He may not be violent towards blacks but he does lead members of his family in a very distasteful song about blacks, showing how unwelcome Gbatokai is, to Michael. By the end of the movie, when Christian's story has been verified, Michael cannot stand how he looked up to his father his whole life and turns violent against him, showing the difficulty he has with the new situation. Thomas Bo Larsen portrays this character excellently, with his quick spats of rage being incredibly poignant. Un-credited due to the Dogma nature of the film, director Thomas Vinterberg created a movie that gave the burgeoning genre some very strong beginning steps. Despite the requirements necessary for a Dogma film, the movie is well made, specifically, well-acted. However, recommending the movie is not easy. The film is never super slow, but it is not particularly fast paced. What keeps me from giving my recommendation to the common audience is the subject matter; watch this movie only if you truly do want to experience the dark and painful situation of father losing his family because The Celebration is certainly no celebration.",

            "content": "Overall I thoroughly appreciate the film, I feel it was well done and expertly told the story of this twisted family. Even without understanding Danish, the body language and clear emotionality with the actors was convincing and I believed the progression of events and it made it feel as though the characters themselves were moving forward in their lives and not being fed lines by a director. The wildly contrasting emotions depicted were startling but effective; there would be moments of truly uncomfortable silence at the dinner table then the brother screaming at the top of his lungs. Sound was an interesting aspect of emotions for the film and differed for each character. Michael always had his emotions on the surface (especially anger) and would yell and curse constantly, and it is hard to watch him as a character disrupt Christian's emotionally charged silence. After the movie progresses and Christian calmly breaks that secretive silence, suddenly seeing Michael run about in chaos and fury is not so bad compared to the deep emotional pain inside Christian. The interesting Dogma style film angles and hand held techniques supplemented the realistic feel of the family interactions. The hand-held filming reinforced the Danish standard for artistic films as well as an added sense of realism in the storytelling. The family is rather strange and a bit crazy, but are believable in their characterization and the way the truths of the past emerge through the woodwork of a long family dinner wraps the viewer up into the plot and slowly reveals the darkness this family holds within them. The lack of a background score definitely supports the emotional transitions in the film; the vivid and natural sounds would lose some of their subtle power if there were instruments to distract from it. The lighting and carefully chosen settings of natural light help to remove any feeling of these terrible events being dreamlike. Keeping the story real-feeling puts the emphasis on how the abuse portrayed is not something just seen in this film, but also something that can happen to any of us. I appreciated how there was nothing miraculous that saved them from the horrors within their family, that fixing anything would have to come from within them. The mother as a witness to the abuse is an interesting and familiar figure; when she witnesses the abuse, does she act? Repress it? She simply goes on with her life, but that also rests some blame on her shoulders for not protecting her children. The little abuses grow into larger ones and they are all layered into one very dysfunctional family. The theme of denial or repression was one that pairs nicely with the one of abuse. At first when Christian reveals his dark relationship to his father, the family pretends it didn't happen and tries to continue on with the dinner rather than face reality. They do this several times, but once it becomes apparent that Christian is not lying, they are forced to face the discomfort. In the Dogma style, there is not supposed to be any superficial violence, and I would like to know more about how the violent scenes were filmed since I couldn't tell if they were genuine or not and it detracted from the realistic feel. Other than details like that, I felt the movie had few drawbacks beside the discomfort of viewing such a dark film. For a story full of such dark, horrific truths, the Dogma style was perfect to play out this story because it removes many of the Hollywood-esque techniques that make films larger than life. Without extra music, sweeping film angles, or manipulated settings the story is given a realistic quality that would otherwise be impossible. The Dogma style requires every event to have as little superficiality as possible, nothing fake or superimposed. In the world of films such as Avatar and Harry Potter which bend reality into fantastic alternative possibilities, a film such as Celebration has such a stark realism that strikes deeper than an epic adventure. This story could happen, and the movie-making technique doesn't have to manipulate what is depicted to convince the viewer of the film's realities beyond the acting. The themes of abuse, relationships and repression are portrayed skillfully in this realism and avoid the obstacle of believability that cookie-cutter films must overcome. The commentary this realism evokes on the health of relationships, owning up to truth and abuse is quite pungent and important.",

            "content": "\"This family is Kaput\" words uttered by the character Michael while he nearly beat his father to death. Kaput meaning destroyed is not only how I would explain this family, but also how I would explain the quality of this film. Although this film was done in 1998 the camera angles and quality of the film made it feel as though it dated no further than 1970. Although the story eventually grasped my attention it was hard for me to forgive the minor issues with the camera.For starters the actors in this film are very believable, believable to the point that I had to keep reminding myself that I was not watching a home video and that I was watching a movie. In the beginning of the movie I angrily sat there staring at the screen, wondering what the hell was going on. I found Michaels character to be a little over the top seeing that he let his family walk to the hotel for the simple fact that he wanted to speak to his brother about something. That did not sit too well with me. As the movie progressed though the characters came along painting different parts of the story which eventually fit its self into one piece at the end.This movie is very unique in the way that it is brought along. The topic of rape is a very touchy subject, and when you add a parent molesting their children for many years then it becomes a topic that no one wants to hear about. This movie builds you up to think that this family gathering is going to be somewhat odd, but then it throws a curve ball at you showing that this family is not just very odd, but very disturbing as well. The phrase \"skeletons in the closet\" would have little meaning to this family. What is interesting about this gathering though is how everyone seemed so calm although the situation which was presented on numerous occasions throughout the dinner. This is what threw me off. How could all of the guest stay at that table singing and clapping and laughing when they were in the presence of a child molester? Not only did they still go along with all of the festivities, they did not leave and they woke up the next morning to have breakfast and act as though nothing ever happened. I don't know what though were more confusing, the guest and them partaking in this matter as though nothing happened, or the father/ masters of ceremonies letting all of this go on knowing that his son was telling the truth.Although I would not prefer a movie such as this one, I could not help but to think about how good this movie was overall. When I eventually figured out how off this family was I was very angry at how the mother and father could not only do this, but also how they could let this go on. By the end of the movie though I felt very sad for the family as though they were real. Although what the father did was unforgivable and what the mother allowed to go on was unforgivable I felt sorry for them because they were hopeless. They both had a disease which allowed them both to not protect their children and let them grow up in a world where they are never going to feel comfortable or safe, seeing that they could not be comfortable or safe in their own home. This may happen in places all across the world which this movie helped me realize but there is nothing a lot of us can do about it. This movie made the audience feel like that as well. Although Christian but this situation to light what happened in the past could not be changed and that has brought one of the children of this twisted family to her death. This movie leaves you to think about is this happening around you and it also leaves you to think about how powerless the rape victims are when these things are happening to them. With that being said this movie was a very sad and unfortunate movie in which you wish could not be true. I thought this movie was great though when it came to acting and the story. The movie eventually came together although it took time but I would recommend it to most people who like a movie filled with drama!",

This is quite simply one of the best movies ever made about familial dysfunction.Dogma 95 is document signed by four directors which says that only hand held cameras should be used, only natural light and sound be used and no post-shooting manipulation.  I think for most parts this is a stupid publicity stunt.  But for the purposes of this movie, this is the right technique.Festen (Celebration) was shot with a digital camera which allows for better images in the dark (especially if there is only natural light).  However digital technology still being rather primitive a lot of images are very grainy, especially the ones shot at night.  It is amazing how Vinterberg uses this limitation as an unique strength.  The story starts out in broad daylight as we get introduced to the characters.  The handheld camerawork is mostly fluid at this point.  The images while not sharp aren't too grainy either.  As nightfall approaches and the emotional bombs start to drop, the images become more and more grainy until the emotional sequence between the wayward son and the father in the garden is almost unviewable. Even the indoor images with more light to shoot are impossibly grainy.  I suspect Vinterberg did manipulate his camera while shooting to obtain those images. This perfectly captures the tortured emotions the major characters are undergoing.  The camera movements also reflect this.  Then for the final resolution at the breakfast table, Vinterberg carefully bathes his entire cast in the full morning light.  The picture is no longer as grainy as it was earlier.  You sense a resolution approaching.  The camera movement is a lot more graceful and the editing not as jerky as before.  When the resolution comes (the father's statement and the son's gentle advice), you can literally see some hearts breaking and some hearts being healed.  This is because the camera allows itself to capture the emotions on the faces fully.  Of particular note is the granite face of the mother as the son talks to his father.The hand held camera allows for great flexibility in what the cameraman decides to concentrate on in any particular take of a scene (i.e. judgments can be made at the site of shooting as opposed to an editing room).  This is a valuable asset if you are filming a family drama involving various interactions.  This obviously will not work for an apic, say \"Titanic\" which requires spectacular visuals.  The limitation however is that the audience can get real tired.  There were various points during \"Festen\" when I could appreciate the camerawork but also got fed up with it.  Only the superb script and extraordinary acting kept me glued to the seat.  A more limited use of the hand-held camera as in \"Breaking the waves\" might have worked better.  But as it exists, the underlying story and acting are so strong that no amount of technique can ever overwhelm it.",

You could easily imagine that the entire movie was shot by an uncle of yours using his handy-cam. The feeling of authenticity seems to me to exaggerate, in a positive way, the overwhelming emotions of disgust and rage one feels.Vinterberg has definitely managed to capture his audiences attention, and in doing so the Dogma 95 has become a vehicle for the brilliance of the plot, and not the central aspect of the film. \"Festen\" is a fairly provocative film, although, in my mind, not nearly as provocative as Lars von Triers, \"Idioterna\". The subject itself is one of utter importance, but the Vinterberg\u00b4s main critique seems to me to focus on what he seems to find perverted in the Scandinavian, or perhaps even European, burgeoise society. It is of course not for me to judge whether he is right or wrong in his criticism, but the fact is that one does recognize certain elements which are fairly typical displays of the lifestyle of the well-off, elements that seem to belong to times long gone.",

But Festen is different; the shaky-cam and intimate angles play into the domestic instability, and actually impart an energy that helps place the audience at the table, stewing in the atmosphere of uncomfortable tension. And this Thomas Vinterberg film is one that relishes tension, playing off of the tightrope walk between social graces and honesty. The family is taken aback by explicit and unexpected accusations, and their first response is to ostracize the accuser despite the emotional authenticity of his pleas; the air in the room is quickly replaced by a shared, uneasy denial, almost surreal in nature. It takes several additional outbursts, including the testimony of an unquestionable source (from a candid suicide note) to ultimately force the truth onto the family, and even then breakfast returns to a cheery balance the following morning, with the notable exclusion of one now-reviled family member. Equal parts caustic, bleakly comic, and dramatically powerful, Festen is stripped-down but hard-hitting, a testament to the strength of a new aesthetic movement when paired with a narrative that actually complements it.

Hanging over the occasion is the recent suicide of Christian's twin sister, Linda.  Then, during the toasts at the dinner, Christian drops a bombshell.\n\nBrilliant drama from Danish director Thomas Vinterberg.  Immediately engrossing, with well-developed characters, each with their own unique peculiarities, and a high level of engagement.  Very interesting plot, with Christian's revelation kicking the intrigue up several notches.  It doesn't let up from then on out.\n\nClever camerawork from Vinterberg.  Many of the shots give a home-movie feel, heightening the candid, family atmosphere, and providing a touch of irony, considering how the plot develops.\n\nThe ending may feel anti-climactic but anything more would have been unnecessary and would just have diluted the brilliance of the movie.\n\nSolid performances all round, with Ulrich Thomsen, as Christian, the pick of the lot.\n\nThomas Vinterberg went on to direct two more masterpieces: Submarino (in 2010) and The Hunt (in 2012).

            "content": "You haven't been to a dinner party from Hell until you've attended the festivities that surround Thomas Vinterberg's \"Festen\", a visceral drama with occurrences more nightmarish than anything you could ever imagine happening prior to a family event.  Most dread trivial reacquaintances, like getting stuck chatting with your aunt who peaked in high school, revisiting the cousins you never much got along with in the first place, or getting awkwardly kissed by elder relatives you couldn't admit the birthdays of if they asked.  It's not ideal to socialize with people you were born into socializing with - but it's much more enjoyable than the harrowing experience the Hansen family endures over a cold weekend in 1998, where the sixtieth birthday of patriarch Helge (Henning Moritzen) goes awry following a startling confession.\n\tThe get-together, held at the family-run hotel, is already a breeding ground of heavy tension: recently, eldest daughter Linda (Lene Laub Oksen) committed suicide in one of the building's several bathrooms.  Though her death is tragic, the family is past the mourning phase - the circumstances surrounding her demise are unknown to most, the majority of the family looking at it as a fatal bout of depression.\n\tBut Linda's twin brother, Christian (Ulrich Thomsen), knows the truth.  Linda didn't kill herself because of ever-mounting stress or a particularly bad case of melancholy - she killed herself because of the sexual abuse she, along with Christian, endured as children at the hands of their father.  Being the eldest two kids, their younger siblings, Helene (Paprika Steen) and Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen), know nothing of the abuse.  So when Christian's toast to his sister at dinner turns out to be a startling confrontation, the family, bourgeois and prosperous, is thrust into a long-winded state of denial, eventually transforming into civil turmoil.  \n\tFamously, \"Festen\" was the first film released under the short-lived reign of Dogme 95, a movement conceived by Vinterberg and Lars von Trier that was designed to take the most naturalistic aspects of filmmaking and put them in the place of the more conventional, costly characteristics of modern moviemaking.  Most noticeably, the era utilized handheld, digital cinematography, unnervingly realistic performances, and an unshakable feeling of voyeurism rather than passive entertainment.  In 2015, such practices are hardly revolutionary - by now, mumblecore and grittily minded horror movies have taken Dogme's place - but in the '90s, it was unheard of, save for the John Cassavetes pictures rarely watched by the mainstream.\n\t\"Festen\", along with von Trier's \"The Idiots\", are the best known films of the movement - and though \"The Idiots\" is still unseen by me, I can confidently say (as someone without much of an opinion regarding von Trier) \"Festen\" is the superior of the two, a feat of filmmaking that goes far beyond the gimmicky nature of Dogme itself and stands as an unshakable black comedy that progressively becomes a moving drama.\n\tIt begins with the same attitude we carry when attending family reunions, one of barely-there excitement soon eclipsed by decided anxiety.  Without the knowledge of what's to come, we can only laugh at the appalling behavior of Michael, who, upon his introduction, kicks his entire family out of the car to give the walking Christian a ride to the hotel, despite enough room.  We can smile at the way Helene's workaholic nature deteriorates as the family gathers and she is once again looked at as a child who, what do you know, grew up and became successful.  Even the uneasy relationships presented pass by with an uncomfortable chuckle - we've felt that very same tension, and a sort of relief washes over us as we realize that we don't have to partake in conversation ourselves.\n\tBut once Christian's toast at dinner turns the reunion into a revelatory exhibition of abuse, we, along with the invitees, don't know how to react.  Though we're disgusted by everyone's instantaneous denial (they all go back to eating as if nothing happened once the accused is spotlighted), part of us wonders if we'd do the same - would we ignore a bombshell just to continue on the cumbersome path we dreaded to embark on in the first place?\n\tWith its voyeuristic camerawork, fearless direction, and too-close-for-comfort performances, \"Festen\" asks us to at once emphasize and look at the scenery in horror.  It is painfully confessional and painstakingly well-conceived - the story, involving and often times funny, is well-suited for the rules of the Dogme.  Vinterberg's direction is so effortless it's not hard to come to the conclusion that everything we're seeing onscreen is spontaneous, completely in the moment; but when we leave the theater speechless, stunned, it's clear that the intended effect was not to execute a forgettable exercise in celluloid eccentricities but to take us on a journey far too disturbing, far too poignant, to ever lose sight of.  \n\tSome have questioned the tone - is it farcical or is it unflinchingly realistic? - but Vinterberg doesn't strive for either label.  It's a slice-of-life with too much crust, carrying an abundance of grit and not enough joy.  And yet, you can never take your eyes off the screen, either because the actors so perfectly embody Vinterberg's vision or because the cinematography, appearing in-the-moment at first glance, stunningly reflects the film's events.\n\tAs \"Festen\" closes, we're well aware that we'll never have an experience quite like it, and that Christian will never have a moment during his lifetime that won't be haunted by his past.  The final shot, a close-up of his thoughtful face, is shrouded in silence but says more than anything most films could ever dream of.  Despite the emptying of inner-demons, the unforgivable can never be forgotten; an emotional scar can never be lightened by an over-the-counter topical cream.",

The central idea is the gathering of relatives and friends for a father's sixtieth birthday of a moderate successful hotel resort located far away from the city- sort of like the hotel inn of \"The Shining\".  We had just learned that much of the characters had just come from a funeral of a sister who was living at the resort for we don't quite know in terms of it's circumstances until as the movie progresses. All I can say is that while watching this is like the hand held camera equivalent of Ingmar Bergman's \"Cries And Whispers\" since the revelations are shocking and demands some mature understanding.

            "content": "The first film to be made under the controversial Dogme 95 manifesto, whereby filmmaking is stripped by to the bare basics, no luxuries or special effects. Just filmed as it is on camera, rather like a home movie. Festen was directed by Thomas Vinterberg (The Biggest Heroes (1996), It's All About Love (2003), The Hunt (2012)), is a simplistic but explosive film about family affairs and the secrets and lies every family has. Helge (Henning Moritzen) is a respected businessman and family patriarch, who is about to celebrate his 60th birthday. He's invited most of his family to celebrate the big day at a family run hotel in the Danish countryside. They include his wife Else (Birthe Neumann), his depressive eldest son Christian (Ulrich Thomsen), daughter Helene (Paprika Steen) and his volatile younger son Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen) But, Helge faces a major tragedy, his other daughter and Christian's twin Linda (Lene Laub Oksen) drowned herself in a bath at the hotel before the celebrations start, but Helge decides to keep this a secret from everyone at the party, knowing it would ruin everything. It's an unusual drama, dark if that, but it's amateurish nature seems to suit it. At times, making the viewer feel like a fly on the wall, looking in on these uncomfortable situations, but for a Dogme film, it's better than Lar Von Trier's The Idiots (1998)",

The celebration of the title refers to the 60th birthday of Helge Klingenfeldt-Hansen (Henning Moritzen), who entertains his big family in his castle. But Helge's son, Christian (Ulrich Thomsen, excellent), whose twin sister recently committed suicide, has an important revelation that will surprise - and displease - many people; in the meantime, other secrets are revealed and nobody will get away clean. \"Festen\" deserved all praise/awards it got in international festivals (it won the Jury Prize at Cannes 98) and is a great introduction to Danish cinema.",

Ironically, it's sometimes relatively easy to mistake a deeply dramatic scene for a comedic one. This is a sharp and somehow disturbing tragicomedy that reveals the transformative power of truth, showing how a seemingly ordinary birthday party can change into an acute contest filled with accusations and revelations. After a rough and intense night no one is left unharmed, and the characters subconsciously know that even before they start to delve into the past.\n\nA cultivated and wealthy patriarch Helge (Henning Moritzen) is having a huge, luxurious 60th birthday party, and the whole family is invited. In the group there are three of his children: Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen), a chronic and irascible boozer, Helene (Paprika Steen), an anxious and depressed anthropologist, and Christian (Henning Moritzen), a withdrawn and angry restaurateur, whose twin sister recently committed suicide, among other guests. Before the party even starts, the intimacy of the main characters is exposed, as they plunge deeper into the state of irrepressible existential angst with their peculiar pre-party 'preparations'. When the family gathers for a sit-down with the man of the night, a huge feasts begins and toasts are about to be made. As of then, nobody even expects that Christian is about the make a shocking Speech of Truth, one that will change the course of the whole evening, destroy the relations between the relatives, and ultimately cause a hell of a farce. By accusing his father of sexual abuse when he and his loving sister were little (additionally pointing out that his father is the true killer behind the sister's suicide), Christian only encourages others to expose their true feelings. What began as a celebration of one happy man's birthday turned into a violent, alcohol and hate-filled showcase of the most shocking kind. The gradual loss of innocence (though it's all right to assume that such a disturbing even took place before) is properly 'enriched' with a Dutch racist song, a few fights, a few bottles of wine, and a late-night dance that is supposed to smooth the whole repugnant situation. It's only surprising to observe as all the relatives eat breakfast the next morning in the exact same place, looking into each other's eyes without any apparent regret.\n\nIndisputably, The Celebration is Vinterberg's visionary approach to a family-in-shambles. As in every other Dogme 95 picture, the realism of the whole story is enhanced through on-location shooting, natural sounds, hand-held cameras, and no additional effects whatsoever. Even though it's hard no to laugh at times, the devastating power of this film is as harrowing as the main characters are cold-blooded and self-contained.",

The acting was fantastic, as was the writing, which really added great depth and authenticity to the various characters in the film.
