            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: The Girl Who Leapt Through Time",
            "content": "The poster of this animated movie looks a little suggestive, but nope, it's actually a wholesome time travel movie which explores a little on the vestment of such powers to a klutzy individual, as well as relationships, and the perennial question of what would anyone do if you have the ability to go back into time, and make changes presumably for the better.The Girl Who Leapt Through Time tells a wonderful story centered on 3 friends, the tomboyish and clumsy Makoto Konono (voiced by Riisa Naka), and two hunks Chiaki Mamiya (Takuya Ishida) and Kousuke Tsuda (Mitsutaka Itakura). Theirs is a friendship formed after school at the baseball court where they spend quality time talking about typical teenage stuff. Things start to change however, when Makoto by accident gets the power to time travel, and in her own ditzy way, uses her new found abilities for \"good\" - directly for herself, or in some Emma like moments, to influence the outcome of relationships for her friends and play matchmaker.And that's just scratching the tip of the iceberg. While it's animation style is kept simple and fairly straightforward, it doesn't compromise on the complexity of its storyline. Not that it serves to confuse, rather you'll be amazed by the amount of pathos the story contains, with its various subplots especially when the time travelling stuff kicks in. It has adult sensibilities in the treatment of the plot, and knows exactly when to hit the right emotional chords when warranted.Although based on a book, the story here serves as a quasi-sequel of sorts which takes place some 20 years later, what I can say is that the love stories intertwined has its major one being able to touch like that in Be With You. I loved that movie, and watching how this bore some similarities, you can't help but feel the same emotions coming across in the same way, nevermind that the characters here are animated, as you can feel the pain, the love, and their despair. And that is something that I should say is difficult for the genre - they're not real persons on screen - but yet being able to evoke emotions and for one to react and empathize, definitely makes it powerful, and a cut above others. Something that our local animated films had failed to do in giving us cold characters and bastardized stories from folklore.But it's not always all the time serious in tone or mood. The movie has light hearted moments, sometimes bordering on the slapstick, no thanks to the bumbling Makoto character. In a sequence, it was reminiscent of Chinese Odyssey starring Stephen Chow, where each time travel moment gets played ad nausem with different comedic effect. Undoing blunders as we see is not exactly Makoto's forte, and while she may be using her powers in a carefree way, with great powers come great responsibilities (sorry, can't resist that one!)As usual, anyone can find fault with the time travel paradox which rears its ugly head in any time travel movie, but I would suggest that you park those thoughts aside, and enjoy the story that the Girl Who Leapt Through Time is telling. There are slight attempts at addressing it with its creation of totally new and different realities with each jump, but even then a major paradoxical flaw still exists. At its lowest denominator, the film reminds to seize the day like it's your last, do what's right, and don't be shy in telling someone how you feel about them.The Best Animated Film of the recent Awards of the Japanese Academy, this film gets my vote of support too with its superbly emotional and touching tale, and with its similarities to that aspect of the film which I like to Be With You, it will be no surprise if this movie finds its way to my Top Ten of the year. Highly recommended!",

            "review_title": "Excellent, although somewhat puzzling",
            "content": "This terrific fantasy focuses on a girl who discovers she can jump back in time, and much of the movie is a light-hearted exploration of what a teenage girl would do with that power, which is essentially relive life better, avoid uncomfortable conversations, and eat pudding. The lead character is likably average.There are a few oddities in this movie. Some of them are because it turns out, as I learned at wikipedia, that this isn't actually the same story as the novel upon which it is based but a sequel containing a character from the original movie, which explains a lot. Apparently the original story has been made into several movies and TV series in Japan, so the assumption was probably that everyone would understand a lot of references I didn't get.Also, towards the end, we are given little pieces of information that suggest there is a whole other story to learn, although whether that story is in the original book or whether that would be the subject of yet another narrative I don't know.Then there's the ending, which is logically unsatisfying and yet which I ultimately found emotionally resonant. It's one of these puzzling endings that has you reading wikipedia and going through the IMDb forum posts (which offer a lot of fascinating theories).Well worth watching.",

            "content": "I saw this film at the US premiere at the New York International Children's Film Festival and it really knocked my socks off.The plot of the film has a high school senior named Makoto Konno going through life blissfully hanging out with friends, and trying to cope with the pressures of being a high schooler. On a day when everything is going wrong Makoto suddenly discovers that she has somehow become able to leap through time. Suddenly able to relive great days or correct past mistakes she thinks she has somehow managed to to find a way to make her wishes (and those of her friends) come true. Unfortunately it soon becomes clear that some of the changes have consequences that she never intended.(I dare not say too much more since the revealing too much will clue you in too early as to whats going on in the film, perhaps taking a bit of the edge off the wonder. Trust me you'll thank me once you see the film yourself).More like a novel than a movie this film takes its time getting to where its going and its better for it. Here we have a bunch of likable kids who are simply trying to get out of school and go on to the next level, at the same time trying to deal with things like lost puddings and the members of the opposite sex. Since we get to know and to like the kids (and adults) we become invested in what happens to them. Will they make the right choice? Who can say when you have the ability to do it over again.One of the better animated features of the last year (from any country) this is a smart drama/comedy/romance/thriller. This is unlike any American animated film of recent vintage in that it talks to its audience with out dumbing everything down or needing to follow some corporate formula for success. Here is a film that is more than just dumb jokes, but is instead about people. This is a movie that should be seen by anyone who wants to see a great movie, and not just an animated one.",

            "content": "The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is a very original, well thought-out fantasy about traveling through time. It's categorized as Sci-Fi on IMDb and has quite a decent ranking in the genre. However, Sci-fi is only a secondary tool used in the story. The whole movie has a strong undertone of philosophy. I am glad that I could watch it in HD.Makoto is a jumpy, goofy and lovely highshoolgirl in her senior year. She has 2 buddies in the class, but doesn't know one of them is having a crush on her. Later, she obtained a special ability of leaping through times, and escaped a train accident using this ability. Inspired suddenly, she dumped herself into a time-traveling life that seemed perfect, until......Don't get it wrong. This is definitely not Back To the Future or Terminator. It's never heavy enough to depress you, yet it got messages delivered. The movie blends ordinary life into the fantasy, which gave you another way to look at our ordinary lives. Makoto was cumulating her ego and gradually becoming ignorant after the magic worked time to time . This is a reflex to anyone that became arrogant after some achievements. Chasing after her personal desire for too long, Makoto finally realized the worst consequences always come from the smallest mistakes. Therefore a great portion of this film is about her trying to fix everything back and forth. Different from Butterfly Effects, this movie dealt with such topics in a comedian way. Makoto's goofy personality never gets old, yet it's very involving to see the whole story from her perspective. The romance, although cartooned, had a very realistic touch concerning the youngsters. In Eastern culture, teenagers aren't really supposed to date each other, since their lives only cross each other's at this very innocent, immature and short time. this film rendered the whole feeling to a new level, that at least ties with If You Listen Closely (Whisper of the Heart). It's more surreal and fascinating at times, and finally come to a conclusion that's as beautiful as it's poetic.Although Hayao Miyazaki had raised the bar of animation features (in Japan and worldwide) for more than 2 decades, The Girl Who leapt Through Time still stood out on its own. After I watched this, I could only say, \"Rest in peace, Mr. Miyazaki, for somebody is coming to take your legacy.\" Visually, it's not entirely detailed as some of Miyazaki's recent works. In one viewing you can fetch all the themes and little Eastern eggs the director intended. But this one viewing may touch you deeply. Have you ever ignored another girl/boy, who tried to give you her/his puppy love and first kiss? Or have you ever ignored another human being who got into a lot of troubles without your help? Makoto's tears were shed several times during 1 hour 38 minutes, giving me a lot of chances to reflect on my own ego and personality.What if? What if I could give more attention to him/her...? We ask such stupid questions in real life? The movie's not silly. It's a good movie for kids, teenagers, young adults, middle-ages and elders. No wonder it's so worldly welcomed.9/10 superb direction and art design, with a heartful story to reflect on.",

            "review_title": "Timeless Masterpiece",
            "content": "There are about 10 Japanese films that I re-watch almost every year since their releases. \"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time\" is one of only three such animated films for me.\"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time\" is based on a 1967 hit novel of the same title. The original work has been used in numerous film and dorama adaptations, most famous ones being the 1983 film directed by Oobayashi Nobuhiko. Instead of making just another anime adaptation and possibly becoming just another adaptation shadowed by the 1983 film, the producers took a risk by creating a spin-off movie with the setting of about 20 years after the original story. The gamble paid off big time, as the animated film went on to win at least 23 awards worldwide.The underlying theme in this movie was \"the importance of living the moment\". Our protagonist was given the power to leap back into time to correct her mistakes, only to realize later that the short-term gains only lead to greater losses that followed. The story was extremely well-constructed to teach the lesson of embracing things the way they are, and never run from confrontations, because once that moment gone, you'll never get it back.The director for this film did a phenomenal job of pacing and creating many memorable moments, but it was the live-action film screenwriter Okudera Satoko, who really made a difference for this movie by composing a story out of number of time leaps that slowly developed the main characters and made so many epic scenes possible. Many anime screenwriters fail in movies because they incorporate too many characters, as it is common practice in series, into the limited 100 minute time-frame. What's remarkable about this piece of work is that it focuses on only three main characters. Even counting the secondary cast, there are only 8 characters in total who we are given the names of. The limited number of characters not only improved character development, it also allowed the story to focus on the underlying theme.I was actually very uncertain about the viewing this year because I started watching a lot of TV anime again since the last viewing. However, the only new flaws I've noticed was the excessive still motion in some scenes and most backgrounds, and that the protagonist was being a bit overly insensitive in few instances, which made her character a bit unrealistic. Animation is years ahead of its time, and it still is an excellent example of what happens when music is in harmony with the story/animation. The insert song by Oku Hanako, IMO, is still the best selection ever made among hundreds of Japanese films, anime, and live-action doramas I've encountered. Ending theme is a truly poignant one that really captured the mood and made the story sink in, and the music score throughout the movie has been used perfectly to enhance the drama.\"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time\" is a timeless masterpiece that made me want to cherish every moment, and it's a movie I expect myself to be re-watching for many more years to come.",

            "review_title": "The best of the \"Tokikake\" Movies...",
            "content": "\"Toki O Kakeru Shojo\" (or Tokikake) is probably the most adapted modern short story in Japanese Literature. As of date, there have been six different versions of the Tsutsui Yasutaka story in both TV and movies -- the NHK drama \"Time Traveler ('72) with Shimada Junko; the '83 movie with Harada Tomoyo; the Fuji TV Drama special ('84) with Minamino Yoko; the Fuji TV Drama special ('94) with Uchida Yuki; the '97 movie with Nakamoto Nana; the TBS TV special ('02) with Abe Natsumi and now Hosoda Mamoru's anime movie. Yet director Hosada (Digimon TV series, One Piece) and screenwriter Okudera Satoko (Concent, Kakko No Kaidan 2) took the unique approach of crafting not just another tired adaptation of the novel but rather developed a sequel to the events of the novel which covered a lot of the same themes but with inventive and interesting twists.While at first I had my doubts, I quite enjoyed this movie and consider it my favorite of the \"Tokikake\" movies. Konno Makoto (voiced with great enthusiasm and likability by Naka Riisa) is your typical Japanese high school student who deals with typical teen problems at school and home. Her best friends include brainy hunk Tsuda Kousuke (Itakura Mitsutaka) and happy-go-lucky transfer student Mamiya Chiaki (Ishida Takuya). As with the novel and previous movies, Makoto's world is suddenly turned upside down as she develops the ability to traverse backwards in time (in this case, through a \"time leaping\" device hidden within a walnut shell). What is unique about this movie (and what sets it apart from the previous adaptations) is the exploration of the ramifications of Makoto's \"time leaping\" powers. Whereas before in the novel and movies, heroine Yoshiyama Kazuko/Yoshikawa Tomoko was able to time travel with no real consequence or impact on those around her, the heroine here sees the impact that her powers have on others. At first Makoto uses her powers without abandon and almost in a reckless manner. In time however she soon discovers that not only does her powers change the course of events for herself but also the lives of others. One of the saddest lessons we learn along with Makoto is that \"precious moments\" can't be recaptured or replayed in time.There are fun tips of the hat to the novel and previous movies as well. Makoto's eccentric aunt (a museum painting restoration artist) is hinted to be Yoshiyama Kazuko, the heroine from the novel (a lavender branch is seen near a photo of her as a teen) and the accident that gives Makoto the powers of time travel occur once again in a school laboratory during classroom cleanup duty, similar to the movies.The animation, compliments of the famed Madhouse Studio (Perfect Blue, Paprika, Millennium Actress) are exceptional. The characters move with fluid and vibrant life and the CGI parts are very captivating.While I miss the 1983 theme song by Harada Tomoyo, the soundtrack music by Yoshida Kiyoshi and theme song \"Garnet\" by Oku Hanako are serviceable.\"The Girl Who Lept Through Time\" (a much better title than the often used \"The Girl Who Conquered/Traversed Time\") is a wonderfully touching, funny and captivating movie that teaches us to enjoy those small moments in time for they can never be recaptured again.",

            "content": "The company that made this movie - Madhouse is aptly named, because this movie is insane. What happens when an average high school girl discovers she has ability to travel in time ? Makoto discovers she has ability to move back in time, and she \"jumps\" to correct for all the inconvenient things that happened to her in the past days which includes getting better grades in her exams, exchanging position with another person to avoid getting involved in a chem lab fire, avoiding collision with a guys who's getting thrown across the lawn, eating a pudding before her sister gets to it etc.. All these made possible because she's already experienced them once.Based on a novel by Yasutaka Tsutsui, The girl who leapt through time, or Toki o kakeru shojo (a.k.a. Tokikake) is an animated version of a classic which has been made into a movie, and TV drama in the past with live actors. This is a modernized version reflecting cultural changes in the way youth perceives the world around them. What haven't changed much is the city scape of Japan in the urban area, and it's interesting to compare this movie to the one made back in the '80s.The plot takes maximum advantage of what funny things a person can do when they have the ability to travel in time, and this is done in good humor which is insanely fun to watch.Some connection to the movie with same title made in the '80s also by Kadokawa is hinted as Makoto's aunt is Kazuko Yoshiyama who was the Girl that leaped through time in the '80s version.Voice over is superb (in the Japanese version), and the voice and character of Makoto matches so perfectly.One of the best anime to come from Japan in recent years, this movie is highly recommended for anime fans, and Asian movie fans alike.",

No problem is too trivial to be solved by a little time travel, from pop quizzes to uncomfortable conversations. But, nothing in the past can be changed without consequence, and Makoto's frivolous use of her ability may result in one or more of her friends being lost forever.The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is about as mainstream and accessible as anime gets. The characters are all pretty normal, likable, and relatable. There's a lot of humor in the first half of the story, while the last half is quite serious, heartfelt, and poignant. The animation and character designs are clean and smooth, and have a very modern appeal. The score has a lot of piano pieces that occasionally caught my ear in a very pleasant way.I recommend this both to anime fans, and to those who aren't particularly familiar with eastern animation. The story is an entertaining mix of moments both somber and lighthearted, the characters are great, and the visuals were top-notch.

But things fall apart in the last 30 minutes or so where the tone drastically shifts and everything loses steam. GIRL works best when it's dabbling in teen movie fare, where it's charms are inherent. I couldn't help but be disappointed by the ending, which feels rather disparate from everything that came before it.6/10",

The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is a Japanese animated film that dwells in high school life and all that comes with it, the crushes, the puppy love, the platonic friendship and friendship that soon blossoms into romance. To spice things up a bit, the creators incorporated time travel in the mix and gave it to our klutzy heroine Makoto and the end result is absolutely satisfying as it manages to hit all the right spots and tug your heartstrings. The animation is just gorgeous to look at. It reminds you of a Ghibli movie due to its breathtaking use of rich colors and lavish texture, the film itself almost comes alive with its near perfect animation. The voice work done is perfect as well, integrating it seamlessly into the film thus giving life to the colorful and cheerful characters on screen. While the Sci-fi part and the time travel stuff may not be ironed out to the highest level, I suggest you leave your Einstein mindset right at the doorstep and just enjoy the story that the film is telling.

            "content": "With Christmas only being 2 weeks away,I started to think about what movie I could pick up for a friend who is a big fan of animated films.Having recently introduced her to Hayao Miyazaki's tremendous 1997 film Princess Mononoke,I felt that it would be a good idea to take a slight division from Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli,by taking a look at the work that regular Ghibli Art Director Nizo Yamamoto had done with Mamoru Hosoda,which would also give me the exciting chance,of witnessing someone leaping through time.The plot:Taking a pile of pop-quiz school papers up to the rarely visited top floor of the building,student Makoto Konnon is shocked to find the floor completely deserted.Looking round the disused rooms,Makoto notices that someone has written on a chalkboard in a laboratory room \"Time waits for no one\".Hearing a sudden sound,Konnon trips over an object on the floor,and starts to fall to the ground.Expecting to crash to the ground,Makoto instead enters a time continuum,that takes her a few seconds back in time.Being unable to completely understand the event which has taken place,Konnon at first, goes back to spending time playing catch with her close friends Chiaki Mamiya and Kousuke Tsuda, until a near fatal accident leads to Makoto seeing time flash,and leap,before her very eyes.View on the film:Taking a different route from the traditional path of time travelling films,where the event that the character has to sort out involves accidentally creating some sort of dystopia future,this adaptation of Yasutaka Tsutsui's novel by Satoko Okudera instead takes a strongly down to earth approach,which allows for the film to be focus on the intimate relationship between the three main characters,instead of needlessly getting tangled up by any useless exposition.Keeping the movie limited to a handful of characters,Okudera makes each of the three friends people who are distinctive and easily identifiable to any viewer of the film.From Mamiya trying to gather up the courage to ask the first girl he has ever fancied out,Tsuda trying to make the most of the opportunity's that are available to him,whilst also making sure to keep a grip on his friends in the \"past\",and Makoto,initially seeing time travel as a similar activity to the games that she plays with her friends,until a sudden defeat at this particular \"game\" leads to Makoto having to enter the adult world to sort out her troubles.Going in a similar direction for the time travel aspect of the story,Okudera decision to keep the travelling aspect grounded,allows for the sudden sharp twist in Mokoto's time travelling fun to strongly resonate with the viewer,due to the movie having allowed the viewer to see the fun time travelling adventures through Mokoto's eyes,which allows the viewer to have the same feeling of hopelessness as Mokoto has,when she discovers the very negative effects of her gift.With previously having been the director of a Pokemon type of TV show/movie called Digimon,director Mamoru Hosoda shows an astonishing progression from his kid friendly past by making an elegant,stylish film that most \"live action\" directors could only dream of.Showing a clear influence of Studio Ghibil's Japanamation and also backed by a strong English dub, Hosoda brilliantly uses light and the side of frames to create a slightly supernatural sense of mystery,as events which Hosoda had subtly put at the side of the film, (such as a weird noise that Mokoto only hears for a few short moments before her travelling begins) turn out to be the main key for Mokoto to sort out the troubling events which have taken place.Allowing the viewer to jump head first with Mokoto in the moments through time,Hosoda expertly contrasts the smoothly drawn earth sections of the film by giving the time travelling a rough and warming sketch feel that's covered in 1000's of whirling pencil lines,which leads to the viewer wanting to leap back in time with Mokoto again and again.",

Makoto (Riisa Naka) is a high school girl who, through serendipity, gains the ability to leap back in time (but she only manages moments or hours back). She has platonic relationships with two high school boys, Chiaki (Takuya Ishida) and Kousuke (Mitsutaka Itakura), and they spend their time playing baseball.With her new-found abilities, she does nothing spectacularly profound, and the films intentions aren't to comment on paradoxes or to shift the space-time continuum as is usually the case with time travel narratives. Makoto uses her abilities to repeat events that pleasure her, to ace a school test, and also to avoid certain embarrassing situations with her friends. But as her relationships with, particularly, Chiaki and Kousuke, her leaps become more personally profound, as she attempts to possibly save the people she cares for (within the context of small human moments of danger, and not the usual global/country catastrophes.I love the fact that in Japan, they do not distinguish between live- action cinema and animated (anime if you like) films, they are all simply movies. Now I'm going to contradict this with a Western perspective: This beautifully animated film is a delight to view, with its traditional two-dimensions, it is evidence to the west that 3D, computer generated animation is not the overbearing format, and 2D is still a genuinely viable medium. The film is filled with charming human moments, both touching and thoughtful. Teenage comedies rarely have this level of tenderness of character, that also explores concepts of fate, the passage of time and the intricacies of small human moments, and the delicate nature of human relationships.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

            "content": "All three of his films that said, the other two being Summer Wars and Wolf Children, while neither without flaws(Summer Wars did have too many characters with some better-developed than others and Wolf Children had an at times rushed beginning and ended inconclusively) are great films and near-masterpieces almost as good as the best of Studio Ghibli.The Girl Who Leapt Through Time did get a little too complicated at the end and the character designs lacked the sophistication and detail of the rest of the animation. Speaking of the rest of the animation on the other hand, it's fantastic(something that all three of Hosoda's films have in common) with its luscious watercolour-like backgrounds and beautiful colours. The animation in the time-leaping is so inventive and effortlessly drawn it leaves one breathless. The film also has a great music score(another thing that all three Hosoda films had), it's positively hypnotic and sometimes rousing and sometimes melancholic, I also much appreciated the use of unobtrusive piano scoring.There is a thoughtful script that sounds remarkably natural(Japanese and American, dubs don't always translate well but it does fine here), complete with a deft balance of comedy and drama. The story is always engaging and not boring at all, it's funny, it's poignant, it's imaginative and it's thought-provoking, also using the time travel idea very effectively(one of the better films to do so). The messaging is well-handled and not laid on too thick. The characters are likable and interesting rather than being swamped by the time travel and the voice acting is good in the American dub(even if the title character's voice acting may be shrill for some, personally it wasn't a problem) and very good indeed in the Japanese version.Overall, a great film, near-masterpiece status in fact. If you loved The Girl Who Leapt Time and haven't seen Summer Wars or Wolf Children yet, do so. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Having watched the trailers on the net for Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo (official English title: The Girl Who Leapt Through Time), I've been looking forward to it for a while. With character designs by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, the same guy who did those for Neon Genesis Evangelion, and animation by Madhouse, Tokikake (as it is nicknamed in Japan), is a great-looking movie. Lively and interesting backgrounds, lush colours and detailed animation, it's a joy to look at. Particular mention must be made of the time-leaping effect, which gives you a sense of breathlessness. The voice acting is extremely enjoyable, with the voice actors really managing to convey their characters' personalities, while endearing them to the viewer. The music is great, with a wonderfully wistful theme song \"Garnet\", provided by Hanako Oku. The direction is interesting, with some really nice shots effectively conveying the more important events and scenes. Overall, I really enjoyed Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo, which is why it is such a mystery as to why it is only showing in one cinema house in all of Tokyo. With Gedo Senki generally failing to live up to people's expectations, were Tokikake shown in a few more cinemas, it could have the potential to be the surprise blockbuster of the summer. Definitely to be recommended over Gedo Senki as the anime movie of the summer.",

But waited until after dinner to watch it, and to cut the already long story short, watching this movie was an experience! From the very first scenes I was grabbed. The artwork, I must say I adore, the scenery is beautiful. As for the storyline, sure, we've had time-travelling stories before, but there's never been one which after seeing it, made me want to watch it again (Seriously, as soon as it was over, I watched it again!) Cutting the even-longer story short again, I highly recommend this film, even those who are not lovers of anime might find themselves enjoying this film.

            "content": "The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is the film that put director Mamoru Hosoda on the map and made him a household name in the anime circles. It's a time travel story, but with a very different take on the usual clich\u00e9s. Here the time jumps are short, almost meaningless, and the traveler is not some young adult with a destiny or a world to save. Instead she's just a teenage girl.But it's that seeming normality of the story that makes it so special. Makoto (Riisa Naka) is an average girl, who likes to hang out with her friends and play baseball. She's not even all that bright. She's actually pretty dim, especially when you compare her to the usual heroines of cinema. So when she suddenly gains the gift to travel through time, you can bet that she's not going to be responsible about it. And that's where the film's charm and humour come from.It's also a good animated film on the technical side of things. Studio Madhouse has a distinct animation style that fits the story extremely well, being both fluid, expressive as well as rather urban, if that makes any sense. The voice acting is also flawless, the colours are bright and summery, the music sounds great and all in all it all simply works.If I had to nitpick, I'd say that the ending was not to my liking. Nothing wrong with it, really, but it shifted the tone rather abruptly, though not as much as to be jarring. Though I did like the explanation for the time travel, even if it seemed to have some plot holes. But then, time travels always have. It's pretty much inevitable.All in all this is a good film to check out for all anime fans. It has personality in spades and has an astonishingly good idea for a captivating story. Personally I do prefer Hosoda's Summer Wars to this, but it's a matter of opinion.",

However, things become magical when she realizes the power of time travel and tries to fix the wrong in her life. However, she fixes what possibly should have not been fixed and puts a strain on both her and her friends.It gets a little too complex for it's own good, especially around 3/4ths of the way thorough the film. Sub-plots should have been explained a bit longer and the pace should have probably been slowed down just a little bit. The audience almost expected for something to go wrong and that is potentially a bad thing here as it feels like it weighs down the plot and makes the revelations either arbitrary or more of a Deus ex machina.7.4",

            "content": "Before I watched this movie I had watched a marathon of Anime at Glasgow Film Theater which included Wolf Children, From Up On Poppy Hill and 5 Centimeters Later. There's quite a few things I saw recurring in each of them. High School Romances that stem from awkward interactions, either between two separated friends or a girl who can't tell her feelings to a boy, which lead to lots of tears over their incapability to proclaim their love and stress over hesitant confessions leading to no confession at all. I don't mind Romances in stories, in fact I'm writing my own story where two childhood friends get together, but there are way too many simplistic tear fests in animes, in fact all across animation love stories are developing too quickly. These animes also have a tendency to make the romantic side of the story seem like a death scene from the Grudge. The girl is totally petrified of the guy's feelings towards her in those cases but in others their feelings are immediately mutual. If getting a girlfriend was this easy I would've moved to Japan years ago I began to really like this movie. Great animation, a strong and independent female character, who for the whole time fought against her strengths with short skirts and hanging around men. Although the idea of a time travelling device being disguised as a walnut was pretty stupid it was funny and enthralling up until the last 20 minutes where it turned into another high school romance story with a lot of unexplored plot points like one guy's reason for going back in time, why time travel was invented (other than allowing silk haired hunks to get girlfriends). And what kind of ending was that. The main character goes back in time, altering everything she had altered on her own for that boy only to be told he was going back . Why? What about the crappy timeline he lives in, which he went to the past to avoid, is so great that after spending years in the past he wants to go back there?",

            "content": "I wasn't sure what to expect from this animated film when it was given to me \u0096 I can't even remember the discussion/messages that led another user to post this to me (sorry) as it took me a while to get around to watching it. The film starts out with a bit of a comic air to Makoto's jumping through time; mostly she is addressing minor issues or mistakes that she makes rather than anything more significant than that. After a while though the film starts to move towards more of the emotional core of the story and becomes somewhat of a coming-of-age tale, albeit with low-distance time travel involved. This in turn develops into quite a touching (if not totally clear) set of events that end the film and provided quite a warming conclusion. Contrary to some reviewers here, I do not think the film is perfect or that the writing is brilliant but I will admit that it was cleverly written. The thing that appealed to me about it was that, even as it was about time-travel, it kept the heart and reality of the characters close to hand \u0096 it didn't become Jumper with global action sequences, rather it maintained the focus on Makoto and her relationships. Her newfound ability didn't change who she was or what she felt \u0096 just gave her new perspectives and opportunities, which the film uses within this context to good effect.The animation is typical in feel for the country of origin but is still impressive. It is more \"normal\" than some may expect but the style is cool and the back and foregrounds are all convincing. Although fans of the genre may be used to more in the way of excess, this is still a good-looking film and the effects and imaginative touches it has are mostly used to enhance the story telling rather than just being for the sake of it. The characters are well-drawn in animation terms but in terms of development the main job is done on Makoto. Visually she is cute and appealing, with emotions clear on her but also in the script and performance (by Naka) she is made a real character and is a real part of keeping the heart in the film. The rest of the characters are very much supporting but they are also good from the other actors.I enjoyed this film. Personally I didn't think that it did enough of any one thing well enough to justify the flawless reviews and votes from some of my peers here, but this is not to say that it is still not very good. The sci-fi element never overshadows the heart of the characters and it remains a coming-of-age story even as the leaps and jumps get more convoluted \u0096 and it is this core that makes it as engaging as it is.",

            "content": "\"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time\", a little masterpiece by Mamoru Hosoda, revolves around Makoto, a seventeen year old girl who spends her days lounging with Chiaki and Kosuke, her two best friends. Early in the film, Makoto discovered how to leap backward in time. Hosoda uses this newfound ability as a metaphor for the anxieties and dilemmas teenagers habitually face and seek to avoid.And so we watch as Makoto uses her powers to dodge responsibilities and glide through life. This, of course, eventually leads to unintended drawbacks. Pretty soon Makoto is setting off chain-reactions which demand her full attention. Her little temporal jaunts then make an unintended shift; they become a means of confronting adulthood rather than a means of prolonging adolescence.\"Time waits for no one,\" a sign reads. Hosoda's film itself finds teenagers and adults facing a daunting sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of choices and decisions. What's the right choice? What if I make a mistake? If time can't be reversed, how can I undo any potential future \"errors\"? If we have little control, why choose at all? Why not stay protectively cocooned in infancy? Or bed!Eventually it is learnt that Chiaki is himself a time traveller. He's a kid from the future, running from his own problems and desperate for solutions. Specifically, he's in search of a painting. This painting, which depicts a young woman who radiates calmness amidst swirling chaos, becomes the film's metaphor for a kind of mental or philosophical state which Hosoda advocates: serenity and wisdom in the face of turmoil. Repeated cutaway shots to a cloud cluster, huge, tranquil and looming almost preternaturally over a canvas of confusion, epitomises this state of mind. It is also hinted that Makoto's aunt, a woman who works in an art gallery and restores paintings, is herself Makoto in or from the future (the film's source material makes it clear that they aren't the same character). She works alongside a painting which Makoto will one day preserve, the very painting which will hopefully help Chiaki find peace and strength within his own, original time-line.Ignoring the film's temporal shenanigans, and its fetish-like obsession with ultra short skirts, \"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time\" works well as a romantic drama. When our cast are not cutting their way through much sexual tension, they're goofing off, playing baseball or trying to reconcile both long term planning and the unexpected whims of the heart. The film ends with Makoto promising to meet Chiaki in the future. Hosoda's bittersweet theme song suggests that this liaison never occurs.8.5/10 - See Hosoda's \"Summer Wars\".",

I need not have worried as it was a lovely film with a good set of characters and a good story.The story follows the adventures of seventeen year old Makato who, following a fall in the science lab at school, discovers that she can leap back in time. She finds this out when she has an accident which should have killed her but instead of being hit by a train she finds herself a couple of minutes in the past and relatively unscathed. Once she learns how to repeat the feat she sets about making sure that instead of having a terrible day where everything goes wrong she has a great day instead; she isn't late for school, she knows all the answers in a surprise test and avoids an embarrassing accident in her cooking class.

            "content": "17-year-old Makoto Konno is having a bad day. She's late for school, she fails a pop quiz, she burns up her home economics class, and her sister ate her stash of pudding. To top off a great day, she gets into a horrendous accident that propels her through time.And so goes the time-traveling Japanese Anime' (Japanese animation) odyssey \"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,\" the most pleasant, engaging, heart-warming, and funny animated feature I've seen from Japan in a long time. This Anime' was directed by Mamoro Hosoda from the novel by Yasutaka Tsutsui. \"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time\" (which is about as original and inviting and simplistic as a movie title could possibly get) is actually a sequel of sorts to a novel also written by Yasutaka Tsutsui over 40 years ago, and the story has been adapted into two live-action films released in 1983 and 1997.Makoto Konno is a bright, but not super-smart junior-year high school student. She's pretty, but not beautiful, and her life is exceptionally ordinary. She's also not all that popular and has some trouble with the guys. So when you throw time travel into the mix - possibly using elements from fanfare like H.G. Wells's \"The Time Machine,\" \"The Terminator\" (1984), and \"Back to the Future\" (1985) as inspirations - what can possibly go wrong?At first, Makoto uses time travel to improve little trivial matters in her own life, like waking up earlier so she can be on-time for class, pass her pop quiz, and avoid the fire in home economics. And she can get to the pudding before her sister does! However, as she continues traveling back in time and righting certain wrongs in her life, she soon discovers that her actions are having adverse affects on her family and friends, especially her two best pals Kousuke and Chiaki. Things become complicated when these time travel machinations force Chiaki to profess his love for her (among another alarming secret), and Makoto is forced to travel back in time to avoid the inevitable.\"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,\" even with its blending of teen comedy, teen drama, sci-fi and romance, never finds the time to step into the many time travel paradoxes prevalent in such movies dealing with this subject matter. The film also never wallows in any kind of philosophical angst, pity, or musings about the future and how to avoid it by going back in time. The movie avoids these paradoxes simply because they're not relevant here.The animation is pretty simple and straight-forward without any real complexity; the story is too simple for it. Everything the story needs to tell us is right there for us. But the story does take an unexpected turn to avoid a horrific tragedy for one of the film's main characters. This tragedy turns an otherwise pleasant ride in Anime' into a desperate attempt to change the entire course of the film's events. And this tragedy is resolved in an unexpected, thoughtful, and romantic fashion. The love story here is probably the most interesting thing about the picture, even more than the obvious science fiction elements in the story, which will probably be the most interesting thing for fans of the genre.\"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time\" is a pleasant and fun ride - most of the time in this picture. You can watch this movie - alone or with other Anime' fans - and not hate yourself for doing so.10/10",

Its basically a shojo style anime where the girl takes center stage and faces tough questions about growing up. Of course, these tough questions are given a new spin because not only can she literally avoid answering them, but change what she says once she says it. The film is so well done, however, that it never becomes even remotely obtuse and is easily followed from beginning to end.The animation is absolutely gorgeous, combining hand drawn and digital through high tech layering software, and achieving a combined effect of realism and beauty that few cartoons can lay claim to (in this way it felt a sister film to Takahata's Only Yesterday and My Neighbors the Yamadas.) If you find yourself staring endlessly at the backgrounds, you're not alone. Nature is on full display in this film, and the characters that inhabit it never seem far from a stream or flock of birds. Sunlight glinting off of sign posts, fields saturated in pastel greens, and the cozy warmth of indoor nesting play a large part in setting the mood. Character designs are detailed but not distracting, with all the main characters having expressive unique faces that don't veer off into the Anime extremes. The sound is a huge factor in the film, as it should be in all animation in my opinion, with subtle and effective voice work.I have a feeling this will become one of my most watched animes. It has a sense of humor about itself, but the emotional notes ring very true. You find yourself caught up in a world where reality isn't exactly what it should be, but the stakes aren't all that high in the larger universal context. What you end up with is a story about relationships, ethics, communication, and the inevitability of making mistakes.Hosoda Mamoru was a Studio Ghibli animator and was set to direct Howl's Moving Castle, but declined and went on to work on his own projects. Howl's Moving Castle seems, in retrospect, like the last movie in the world this director should be involved with. The Girl Who Leapt Through Time reminds me more of Kondo Yoshifumi's If You Listen Closely (or Whispers of the Heart), one of my most beloved films, about a young girl also facing adulthood who lives partly in a world of fancy.

You may even think that time travel movies are all the same...the same scene done a little different, you couldn't be more wrong, this movie adds humour to the repeated scenes in numerous different ways. I personally like to watch foreign films in their original language, but I ended up with the dubbed version...however, the voice dubbers did justice for such a beautiful movie.

            "content": "In this (non Studio Ghibli) animated movie set in contemporary Japan, Makoto is in her last year of high school. She is a typical high school girl standing on the edge of adulthood - bright, gawky, clumsy, sociable, unsure of herself, looking forward to further education, not really into boys yet (or not that she would let on, anyway). We see a picture of this likable young woman's life, from always being nearly late on her way to school, to her younger sister eating the pudding she had saved, to life at school, to playing baseball each afternoon on her way home with her two contemporary male pals Chiaki and Kousuke. Then an accident happens and Makoto discovers that she is able to (literally) leap backwards in time. At first, she uses this ability to improve small things in her own and her friends' lives - maths test scores and the like - but then she discovers that there are more important implications.This film - which treats the time travel consequences with respect while never offering an explanation as to how or why - is actually about how the big issues which affect ordinary people are actually all small things - even love, the biggest thing of all.The development of this story is always pleasing and interesting and, at the end, very moving. Without giving anything away, the ending is bittersweet, entirely fair, very sad and full of hope, completely unexpected, and had me (60 year old English man) crying like a baby.The animation, while not enormously sophisticated, is perfectly suited to the material, the backgrounds are atmospheric and attractive, and the film works beautifully. My only criticism is that Makoto's US voice characterisation is somewhat shrill, but I will try again with the Japanese audio and subtitles.Recommended.",

If you come with a Western point of view, this movie is way above everything you've seen, but compared to many Japanese anime, it's slightly above average. Of course, it is an average computed on watchable animes, yes?Anyway, the story presents us with high school girl emotions and time travel and consequences of actions in the same package. After a while I was surprised to see a scene in which a bullied high school student snaps and does something really bad. It took courage to present something like that in a basically feel good movie. And the ending is not that happy either. Hopeful, but not happy.So, one can watch it both for the high quality of the animation, the sci-fi part or the romantic part, yet somehow it didn't affect me so much. Maybe it was because of the bad translation filter I had the misfortune to use or maybe it is the high expectations for a film that won a Best Animation award in Japan.",

I did wish Chiaki Mamiya and Makoto Konno kissed in the end. I didn't figure he was gonna be the love of her life since I thought he was sleazy but as the film went on, he was the complete opposite! It's amazing how the character really changes into something you wouldn't imagine! Although I honestly hated him when he kept calling her 'stupid' even as a 'joke'. The film didn't really bring tears to my eyes but it is scary when those people including Makoto were about to die as the train was about to hit them.

It's almost like the director was trying to assert that love existed on what is a mostly a blank canvas, so the viewer has to use a lot of imagination to conjure up a love story that I feel doesn't truly exist.If it does exist, it's buried in plot holes and a tangled story line that doesn't build tension effectively. It doesn't feel like there was ever much on the line, partly because of how death was brushed off so easily from the start of the film to the bitter end, but mostly because the characters act and react so vacantly to whatever craziness is presented to them. It doesn't help that there is hardly any character history presented, with this just being a look into a slice of just a few days in time.I wanted to enjoy the movie, but found myself constantly unattached and underwhelmed by the main thrust of the film. I feel there was so much more potential for the main character to truly learn valuable lessons, and for story arcs to be more deeply refined but the importance of detail was overlooked in favor of a convoluted plot which ends in what I can only describe as a train wreck of anticlimactic hell.",

Animation - This is probably the best thing about this movie. Though the visualization of time travel, the editing, and some of the direction is all pretty bad, the overall look of this movie is fantastic. The characters are kinda generic and look like they're walking on green screens, but the backgrounds are amazing. Characters - The characters in this movie are so underdeveloped its almost impressive. There aren't any character arcs and everyone is incredibly shallow. I don't know anything about the main character except that she's a bit of a jerk. I don't know anything about the side characters, or the main characters family that isn't extremely surface-level. The finale is supposed to be really really sad, but I can't care because the characters haven't been developed and the story barely makes sense. Story - I can follow what they're going for but it just doesn't work. The characters are too flat and the editing is too bad for me to care. This movie is listed on IMDb as Animation, Adventure, and Comedy. Its animated, but there's no adventure or comedy. I think its supposed to be a romantic drama, but just barely. This movie is so bad. Barely anything is explained, and trying to figure out what happened is a pain. If you really want to watch this, stop watching after the main character notices the numbers on her arm.

            "content": "I must say that with all the raving reviews of Toki wo kakeru shoujo, I was expecting a much better movie. I usually like anime, and I agree that on the technical aspect, this movie is near flawless: The style is nice and simple, the animation is excellent (though some 3d scenes look a little rough), the backgrounds are amazing, and the music is nice ( maybe just a little on the generic side). But I'm trying to be as objective as I can here.However, I think that there are serious problems on the pacing and the story. The pace rushes through the beginning of the film, but halfway through, it abruptly stops, and very strangely finishes in a slow, anti-climatic fashion. In the same way, the story begins very lighthearted, comedic approach, and progresses nicely to a more serious situation building up tension, but there are some events in the end that simply mess up the whole basic idea. Being a time travel story it should be very careful with paradoxes but it ends up being overly complicated, with no explanations about several conflicts, and still doesn't manage to avoid inconsistencies. I understand that the movie is a part of a series of stories about the subject, and maybe reading them all, the final twists might make more sense.. But as a stand-alone story, its very far from coherent.In my opinion the romantic comedy + subtle science fiction elements were enough for the movie to be very good. I must say I was very interested halfway through the film. But it tries to go further adding complexity and fails. By itself, the characterization and the script of the different situations is very good. It feels more natural than many other anime films I've seen, and I did find most characters endearing, -I do give the movie credit for that-. But I had a very hard time understanding why did the writers decide to go in a different direction by the end of the film, the main idea was already solid and very clear, story had progressed in an intelligent manner. Nevertheless after all that, it's as if the film had an identity crisis, and didn't know what goal to pursue. The tone of the final act clearly attacks all of the previous achievements of the movie, it takes itself much too seriously, throwing in an additional half baked sci-fi plot, transforming the whole experience into a melodramatic, confuse and eventually meaningless mess. Needless to say, I was very disappointed.(and I did understand the movie, in case someone was wondering)However, I give it a 6/10, because of what it could have been, and what it does achieve halfway through the movie.",

            "content": "I read the reviews for this movie on IMDb before I watched it and well I did somewhat enjoy the movie it's very overrated as most of the people who reviewed this movie gave it between eight and ten stars praising it as being one best Animated movies of all time. I respect other people's opinions and enjoy reading about other people's experiences when watching movies it's what made me want to watch this particular movie because of the various opinions on it both good and bad so I just hope my opinion is viewed the same way.The movies premise was one of the things that caught my interest in the movie. The story is about a teenage girl named Makoto who after an accident at school discovers she is able to travel backwards in time by literally jumping through time. She does pretty much what most of us would do as a teenager if we discovered the ability to time travel keep turning back time to do juvenile things like sleeping all day then turning back time and getting up early fully rested or cheating on a school exam to get the top mark. After having some fun with her new ability she soon discovers that it's not all fun and games and that her actions have unforeseen consequences for both herself and others and with each jump it becomes harder and harder for her to fix her mistakes.The main reason I couldn't get fully invested in the movies story line is because it's actually a high-school romance Anime and well it does have some interesting ideas and the animation is fantastic this is more a movie for a younger audience who can better identify with the characters or for people who first saw the movie at a younger age and look back on it now as a personal favourite from their youth but if your an older anime fan this may not be as enjoyable depending on your individual taste in anime and movies.There is only one thing about this movie that I hated and that's during most of the movies outside scenes there's this extremely irritating screeching sound which is possibly meant to be a bird or insect of some kind making the noise this sounds like a petty thing to complain about but the noise is so loud and irritating it's hard to pay attention to what the characters are talking about when all I can think about is what is making that sound and why. I initially thought it was my TV or the Blu Ray but whenever I paused the movie or muted the TV the noise stops so it's definitely meant to be a part of the sound editing.I recommend this movie if your a fan of Romance/High-school Anime I would say this is definitely a movie aimed more at mature young adults. The story is cleverly written the animation is stunning and it does have a certain charm to it that even someone like myself who isn't the biggest fan of the genre can appreciate.",

            "content": "A shimmering hot sunny summer day, crickets happily chirping in the background, very bright green and blue colors, two guys and a girl playing some baseball, leasurely talking about life. Yups, Toki O Kakeru Shojo is that kind of film. Which is a little surprising, considering Hosoda's earlier efforts. Luckily, it turned out all for the better.Hosoda gathered a reputation when he elevated two mainstream series (Digimon and One Piece) to a slightly higher level through their movie spin-offs. Sadly, not enough to make them enjoyable. So I quickly lost track of Hosada and after having watched the original trailer of Toki, felt little incentive to renew my interest in his work.Still, when I came across Toki O Kakeru Shojo for a second time, I decided to watch it anyway. And I'm glad I finally did. Hosoda manages himself better with material that hasn't established itself yet. Toki is at heart a typical drama reminiscent of the films of Takahata or Hiroshi Ishikawa, enriched with some fantasy elements, bringing him closer to the work of M. Shinkai. And while his talent doesn't match that of any of the names mentioned above, it would be unfair to call Hosoda second-rate or light-weight.Toki O Kakeru Shojo takes a lighter approach to its romantic theme, mixing in a timid sci-fi perspective. Though the whole time leaping business might sound important, in reality it's just a simple means to put some accents on certain parts of the storyline. It does bring a nice twist to the film, which could otherwise have slipped rather anonymously between a long list of Japanese dramas (animated or not).Visually, Hosoda's style is somewhat acquired. There's a distinct lack of detail in the character designs and the coloring is kept simple as well. Still, it works for the slender, realistic looking characters, especially when you see them animated. The lack of detail allows the characters to assume some more realistic movements. The backgrounds on the other hand are often very detailed and rather lush to look at.The soundtrack is simple but effective, largely consisting of music that creates a soothing atmosphere without being too noticeable. There are a few times where the music is a little over-the-top, but in general there's enough cricket-chirping and soft piano music to put you right at ease.To keep with the lighter atmosphere, Hosoda leaves room for several comedic scenes which blend in well with the rest of the film. By doing this, he makes sure the film never becomes too depressing or hard to swallow. The sci-fi elements remain simple but effective throughout the film and help to keep the film entertaining, leaving the viewer in a constant chilled atmosphere.Toki O Kakeru Shojo is at heart a very simple romantic drama, with a few additions to keep it interesting to the seasoned fan. If you're in the mood for action or lots of plot twists, there's little here for you. But if you're up for a little variation on the Ghibli magic, this film might be a pretty good bet to make. It's not up there with the best, but Hosoda isn't far behind either. 4.5*/5.0*",

I bought the DVD with English subtitles in a nearby store, and felt like a little child once again, being so absorbed by the fantastic animation that appeared on my TV screen.Mamoru Hosoda, known mostly for work in the Digimon series, created a really beautiful picture, which would appeal to everyone, no matter what age. The story is based on a book of the same name. It shows the bizarre, and sometimes complicated, adventures of a girl named Makoto, who one day realizes that she is able to leap through time. Like every normal teenage girl would probably do, she starts to take advantage of that uncanny, and basically random, gift. Whether it's a class test, or a boy-related problem, she can easily omit the difficult circumstances by leaping back in time and changing the whole situation to be just as she wanted. On one horrible occasion she even saved herself from a certain death. I believe that up to this moment anyone would want to have that kind of power.However, not everything can go as smoothly as one can imagine. Makoto starts to understand that her frequent, and mostly unnecessary, time alterations cause harm to others, including her dearest friends, Chiaki and Kosuke. She is not only distancing herself from them, but also putting one of the boys in grave danger. Surprisingly enough, in one tragic moment, Chiaki confesses that he is the one responsible for her newborn ability. Then Makoto starts to regret her superfluous outbursts, which caused more pain than happiness actually. After all the events she even recognizes her true feelings and knows that she made a mistake by rejecting Chiaki's offer for a date.I must say that the story really caught me right from the start, as it presents an instructive take on the matters of time travels. It's hard to find another anime, which shows this particular topic in such a convincing, and enjoyable way. While the detailed and colorful animation is on the highest level, with every character drawn to perfection, it sometimes feels as though one is watching a feature film. Great voice-over makes it that much easier to grasp the full potential of the characters' personalities.It's only a shame that it wasn't advertised on a bigger scale, as it might have been as big as Spirited Away or Howl's Moving Castle once were. I recommend it to every anime fan out there, as it's one of the most splendid and pleasurable animations of 2006.",

Afterwards it slows down to a crawl in which the whole point of the story seems to be heavy on high school dating, which would be absolutely FINE in the realm of coming-of-age stories if it weren't for the fact that you really don't get an opportunity to feel pathos for any of the characters. There is so much potential there, but for the most-part there are no real dynamics within the interactions or relationships. Also, you get the strong vibe that if you say no to a boy when he asks you to date, you are too picky (just say yes to whomever demands it, I guess), so I don't see how this movie would also be good to show preteens/teens/children.This becomes another time-traveling movie where the protagonist has fun with their newfound ability at the beginning but then confronts consequences surrounding said fun, and there is nothing wrong with that. Unfortunately it is also a film where the character could have easily solved all of the problems that are beginning to form just by going back to the beginning and not messing around with anything.Also, the last 30 minutes of the film seem very phoned in. As if the writer looked back and said \"Huh, this really isn't going anywhere, let's see if we can just throw in some obvious tropes.\" Just when you think it is all going to speed up and go somewhere, it really doesn't. Every action within this film just seems like a ploy to suck the viewer in with no real sense of finalized answers. Specific plot holes, and just blatantly overlooked explanations we would have liked to have known would have been nice to put in this review, but that would be hard to do without giving major spoilers. Trust me though, there are SO many holes and little things that a character could have simply done to solve this that, if you actually care about these kind of things in storytelling, would frustrate the heck out of you.Not recommended. It's OK, but nothing to write home about whatsoever. Definitely over-hyped.",

Makoto has had a bad day, making all sorts of stupid mistakes and even falling onto a small walnut-shaped item in her chemistry room. But none of that compares to what happens next: while riding her bike on her way to see her aunt, the train passes through the street. She tries to stop in time to avoid it, but she is hit, dying. But then she wakes up where she was five minutes ago. She has gone back in time.I was immediately drawn in.This films is fascinating on so many levels. It never goes quite where you expect it to go. It is not deliberately subversive, but it is clear that is telling its own story, using tropes and clich\u00e9s instead of falling back on them. The twist they throw in at the halfway mark is clever and smart, and it really adds to the experience, making the movie as a whole even more rewarding than it otherwise would have been.To call the direction inventive would be an understatement. Every artistic decision is the right one. For example, look back at the title of the film. That is not metaphorical. Makoto literally leaps through time. Her powers activate because she flies through the air upon being hit, and whenever she wants to jump through time, she has to jump from high up. When she arrives at her new temporal destination, she is on the ground, rolling. That is so smart and innovative. Time travel as an idea has been around for hundreds of years, and it has been done to death. To bring something new and different to the equation is difficult, if not impossible. But Hosoda managed to pull it off.This is very much a high school supernatural drama. There is everything from teenage awkwardness to teenage indecisiveness to teenage anxiety. But it is done well. I felt like I was seeing the first teenage drama ever made. There is a sense of energy to every second of the film. Things like seeing someone trip and fall were ten times funnier than they otherwise would be thanks to the time and effort put in my the animation team. Animation allows for more energetic expression, something this movie takes full advantage of without making it seem like too much.Makoto is the highlight of the film. The animation on her is fluid and sharp and hyper, and the English dub voice actor does a great job of matching it. She captures every scene of the film. It's enough to almost make me wish there was no time travel element, and the whole story was just her journey through high school.Hasodo's first major project was directing the first two Digimon movies (or, if you're a Westerner, the first two-thirds of the Digimon movie). I was surprised by this, but it makes sense. Those movies were way better than they should have been thanks to two things: one, its ability to make it's human characters interesting to watch and listen to even when they're not doing much; and two, its ability to make a low budget sing. Those two elements are apparent here. Not a lot of extraordinary, jaw-dropping things happen- except in the middle third- but the feel of the movie, that of a hot, past-its-prime summer day, more than makes up for it.As for the 'low-budget' thing: this film has far more money than any of the Digimon movies, but it did not have enough money to go for the big guns on every shot, like a Miyazaki movie could. There is an almost tangible desire of this film to conserve the money for the spectacular shots. And there are a lot spectacular shots. The animation of her going through time is a showstopper. It's like she's traveling through a giant watch.All in all, it feels somewhat like the animated equivalent of an artsy indie movie. There are all the ingredients: young, brilliant director, low budget, adding new twists to old mechanics. It's a unique experience.But that does not mean it does not remind me of things. The first thing that came to mind was the fantastic episodic video game Life is Strange. Some elements of that were clearly lifted from this and given a hipstery, sepia-toned makeover. But as it war on, it started to remind me of a mix of Inception and Run Lola Run. Obviously, the tone is different, but it has a quality of etherealness and visual inventiveness that reminds me of the former and a quality of experimentation and videogameiness that reminds me of the latter.There are a few things that stop this movie from measuring up to the great Miyazaki films. Though the pacing is almost absurdly good, it still doesn't give off as much narrative heft as it wants to. And while there are no characters I find unbearable, I wish the other characters were as interesting to watch as Makoto. But these are minor gripes. This is the sort of film you feel bad for not giving a perfect score. It's powerful, evocative, and innovative. These are the kind of films we need more of. Hosoda may be no Miyazaki, but with luck, he could usurp Miyazaki's crown. If that happens- and it looks like it is- the future of Japanese animation looks bright.",

            "content": "I am not keen to like movies like these, mostly because they are animated, don't get me wrong they might be great and grown up like but sometimes they lose face for me. That's also why I will always get surprised when I see something like this. Story 9/10 - The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is about a girl who suddenly gets to stop time, however she is affected by a counter on her hand, which she doesn't get at first, her friends consist of two boys and a girl, probably more than that but mostly about three people, these three friends are, Kousuke Tsuda, Yuri Hayakawa, Chiaki Mamiya. The movie is mostly about events up to a certain plot line that will blow your mind, it isn't that huge at all but it still will make you twitch and wonder. When she gets this power she uses it for selfness needs, changing many outcomes including the many times that Kousuke Tsuda asks her out on a date, In the end however she slowly loses more and more chances to change the future ending up with an outcome she certainly didn't want, I am not going to tell you what the outcome was or what it involves I am just going to say that you should defiantly see this movie for its story if not for anything else. Actor - 9/10 Likable Characters from start to finish, normally the voice acting for something like this is screwed up, sometimes they choose the wrong voice actors to do something like this, but in this movie they didn't, I have seen it in Japanese and in English, and I can say that both are great, the English voice cast does a great effort to bring the characters to life, it is like they wanted to act good in this movie and I like that fact. Also it should be mentioned that even though that there aren't any famous people acting the voice, I wouldn't say that there is but they feel like they would be in my opinion they are just as great as say some of the greatest actors of our time. Music 10/10 - I was surprised to hear the two songs, and especially the inserted song, normally when they sing somewhere in the movie it is sometimes ruined, not as well but sometimes it is just not that perfectly done at all and you feel left alone really. Hanako does those two songs the justice they really need, if it was just for the story it would be okay but the music does a lot to create an even more exhilarating experience, I feel like they couldn't have done it without her at all, great song, great voice, just great music, it really needs to be point out. Animation 8/10 - It is computer animation as I see it, that's not something that I hate at all, but it does prove that it could've been done more awesome with real hand to hand drawn images but then again somewhere probably hand drawn so I can't say anything against that at all anyways. Overall 9/10 - The story is great, music great, actors great, the animation could've been better but then again it was drawn to perfection in my opinion it is like they really wanted this to work, I would say buy it and keep it, store it away and one day in the near future and even in the far future see it again, I am sure it will work for you even the second, the third time, it is great and I say love it!",

After a mysterious event in the science lab and later being hurled into two oncoming trains, Makoto discovers that instead of dyeing she gains the ability to \"leap\" backwards through time re-living periods of her life again. Reminiscent of both \"Run Lola Run\" and \"Groundhog Day\" it begins as a playfully fun comedy of errors then shifts gears, as Makoto begins to realize the consequences of using her new powers thoughtlessly. She literally falls on her face several times before she comes to learns some hard life lessons about what is really important and what she needs to do to make things right again before her time-jumps expire. The ending is bittersweet, heartwarming and triumphant. It is not surprising that this anime is so good when you realize it was made by several talented ex-Ghibli studio refugees.

It has a wildly imaginative yet simple story backed up by believable characters and good animation.The story is universally relatable: who hasn't thought about what they would do if they could travel through time? The film successfully illustrates the consequences of tampering with something one doesn't fully understand and ultimately shows that things aren't always perfect, no matter what you do. As the main character's time leaps start to cause unwanted consequences you truly feel for her as she tries to do everything right.The characters truly make the world come to life: the protagonist is instantly likable as a bit of a klutz, and her sometimes erratic behavior provides some great comedy. The other characters are completely believable and relatable as well. The depiction of the friendship between the three main characters at the beginning feels incredibly real and natural. It's hard to not care for them.The voice acting and animation aren't bad either. The character animation is particularly smooth and pleasing to the eye. The characters convey loads of personality through just the way they move and act. The voice acting is great, and brings a great deal of emotion to the characters.In summation I can hardly find any major criticisms for this movie. It won't blow your mind, but it's a genuinely touching and heartfelt film.Recommendation: Absolutely worth seeing. If you're trying to get friends into anime, this is the film to go.",

He needs to be more charismatic and he needs more time on the screen. I get that he's a super cool dude. The most compelling aspect of his character seems to be his hair.

            "content": "Adolescence is a confusing stage of life, things adults may find silly can be of paramount importance to the young teenage mind and priorities are seemingly a deck of cards in a continuous state of shuffle. It can be confusing and frustrating, but it can also be a little magical amidst the turmoil. Few movies capture this feeling and time in human development as well as the girl who leapt through time does. It's lengthy title cleverly alluding to both its coming-of-age theme and sci-fi leanings.The cast is small and the characters are complex, rich in life, yet not conforming to traditional teenage stereotypes. They feel like real people. The story is refreshingly focused, yes as the title suggests there is time travel involved, but the narrative resists devolving into a bog-standard, action-packed, save-humanity kind of tale and instead, keeps its feet firmly planted with the characters and their emotional journeys. There isn't much practical science involved and this creates some potential plot holes for some viewers, yet what may not make sense for the head in this story, always makes sense for the heart.Aesthetically, the visual style is very firmly anime, reduced frame rate, giant eyes, and wildly fluctuating amount of visual detail...the works. Your mileage may vary.The story takes a while to get into high gear, opting to spend more time getting to know the characters and how they interact with each other rather than rushing the plot device or spouting much exposition at all. That said, when the narrative begins clicking, it trots along at a brisk pace. Many science fiction films fall into the trap of over explaining their plot device, something The Girl Who Leapt Through Time barely even attempts. To some, this will be refreshing, letting the unknown science be unknown science and focusing on character instead. To others, it may bother them that the writers didn't pack some pseudo-science babble in to gloss over potential plot holes through narrative distraction. Either way, the approach almost seems like a brave choice in a film genre so dependent on flashy, scientific gimmickry, that it almost loses sight of character. That stated, as the crux of the narrative is character driven, and the characters are all young teenagers, some audience members may not be able to relate to them or their choices, possibly diminishing their investment in the story.Overall though, with some suspension of disbelief, the film has a charmingly light touch. It's moving without attempting to be life-changing, it's subtle without being vague, and it's angsty without being grim-dark or emo.Content-wise, there's very little here to keep this one from being a good watch for the whole family. An objectionable joke is repeated twice and there's a moderate amount of danger, but nothing's pervasive, and the film has a general feeling of innocence and exploration.Should you see The Girl Who Leapt Through Time? If spending a couple hours with carefully crafted anime teenagers trying to figure out their place in the world with a mild sci-fi flavor seems pleasant (or unpleasant), then you have the answer appropriate for you.-Josh Evans",

The look of the film is different from Studio Ghibli, but still considerably realistic.

My favorite scene is when Makato goes back through time to the moment when she discovers her time leap powers, it's a beautiful sequence with a beautiful song.

But even then, they don't focus as much on the traversal of time as other stories do (and fail). The only problems with the traveling is the \"teleportation\" they do. Like her moving instantly from one place to another. Along with her transferal of momentum to her previous self. Those make no sense, but they're not given much focus either, so I can forgive those faults. *end spoiler*The entire story is an obvious labor of love. So much detail has been put into the characters and which parts of the story you are being shown. The movie never feels like it's wasting your time. Only towards the end did I feel like they were dragging a bit. I loved the big twist. It was done really cleverly.I also wasn't impressed with the voice acting, nor sound effects. The main character sounded really fake when she was laughing and crying. Really fake. It bugged the crap out of me. She was good outside of those moments though.

However, she soon finds out that frivolous use of time-leaps hasn't just affecting her own life but lives of many others as well.Directed by Mamoru Hosoda, the film doesn't concern itself with figuring out the technical process behind time-leaps and simply runs with the concept.

Things do get grim & serious in the second half but the ending isn't satisfying enough.The animation is rich, colourful & wonderfully detailed. Characters however aren't very compelling, and interest in their journey is lot mid-way.

Initially she uses this ability frivolously, to undo embarrassing moments, retake tests at school, extend fun times, etc. but eventually learns that her changes could have consequences on other people's lives. The light-weight story is enjoyable and fun, especially the scenes of Makoto crashing into her 'new presents' (she literally has to 'leap' to make the temporal transfer) but a bit confusing and ill-explained, especially the nature of the time travelling. Having not read the book nor seen any of the other versions, I didn't appreciate that Makoto's aunt Kazuko Yoshiyama was the 'girl' in the original eponymous book and that this film was essentially a sequel, which explained mysterious aunt's cryptic insights (the whole Aunt/painting-restoration subplot seemed to go nowhere). The animated backgrounds are outstanding, with a rich pallet and fine details, and the characters, if a bit simply rendered, are fine (other than Makoto's crying scenes, which look ridiculous and undercut the pathos of the moment). I am always surprised by how engaging and affecting anime characters can be. 'Turning back time' is a classic wish-fulfillment fantasy and lends itself to entertaining 'learning from your mistakes' stories (1993's 'Groundhog Day' is great example). 'The Girl Who Leapt Through Time' has some fun with the concept but doesn't offer much new and the d\u00e9nouement, which drifts into incoherent metaphysics, isn't very satisfying (but IMO and I'm five decades past the target audience).",

            "content": "\"Time waits for no-one\". Ever wanted to go back in time and avoid a certain conversation or pass your exams (knowing the answers beforehand) with that elusive one hundred percent rating? Makoto did, and dare I say I would watch her do it all again. Hosoda is an acclaimed director of the Japanese animation genre, particular with his accessibility for Western audiences. However one of his first films that broke through the international spectrum was this, a science-fiction romance that boasts both hilarity and drama. Upon reflection, despite the frivolous shenanigans, it's a meaty story. Acting as a personable coming-of-age drama that ticks along perfectly. A teenage girl acquires the power to leap back in time, and so she starts to resolve minor problems that she and her friends experience. However she starts to realise that messing with time causes fatal consequences.The ability to seamlessly blend a variety of genres and still maintain adequate character development for central protagonist Makoto all comes down to Okudera's pragmatic screenplay. He takes the idea from the original 1967 novel and questions the motives of a teenager if they were to acquire such power. They wouldn't leap back in time to stop a war or change the course of worldwide history. They would time travel to match-make their best friend or consume their mother's delicious Wednesday night dinner again. It's a personable story to Makoto, which is why the plot feels so involving. You believe in her actions. We watch her grow as a young woman every time she \"time-leaps\", in an attempt to improve her life. But naturally, changing the course of time for one's personal gain consequently results in others having their timelines affected. Makoto rapidly realises that her life is altering for the worse, despite having control. A romance blossoms and then swiftly dissipates. Her friends too busy to play baseball with her. It's small narrative alterations like these that prove the time-shifting narrative structure is as effective as ever. Hosoda inventively recycles the same scenes, as Makoto travels back in time, to comedic effect as she attempts to perfect each scenario. He then culminates her journey into this pivotal scene involving a train and then it hits you. This wave of realisation. It's not about the destination, it's about the journey. Makoto's to be precise. And I have to admit, it's a near perfect resolution.The rules and laws of \"time-leaping\" are set out from the start and Okudera frequently leaves breadcrumbs for further developments, such as Makoto mysteriously garnering markings on her arm. Where he does fail though is the third act, which is all too common in sci-fi anime flicks. The entire story and character motives are explained through a long succession of verbal diarrhoea, and is abhorrently uninspired. It lacks the impact and inventiveness of the story that preceded it, basically hand-holding the audience relinquishing all sense of mystery. A five minute scene almost diminishes the entire story, but fortunately Hosoda gets back on track and delivers a conclusion that made me stand up and shout \"I ship them!\". Sweet, tender and executed with the correct amount of sensitivity.The animation is stunning as to be expected, particularly the moments where time stops and characters are floating in mid-air. The bustling environment harnessed bright colours and character movements were fluid. There are a few scenes where background characters lack detail and look somewhat unfinished, but it's all part of the charm. Also to note that Yoshida's score was exceptional, especially the piano tracks. Suitable for that summer sweetness and chaotic classroom life. And probably for the first time ever, I actually liked the English dub. Suffice to say I loved the film. Adored it even. If a film manages to push me into shouting at my TV \"Run! Find him before it's too late! Embrace him!\" then it's a success. Hosoda is the man! Oh, be right back, just going to travel back in time so I can watch this again.",

            "review_title": "Takes \"Playing God\" to a New Level",
            "content": "(This review discusses the English dub, so don't read if you hate dubs.)Makoto Konno is your typical teenager: careless, athletic, a social butterfly and a girl who just manages to get by in both school and life. One day, however, things take a turn for the worse: after running late for school, flunking a test and getting into a series of accidents, Makoto's bike jams on the way to her aunt and causes her to run head-on with a train, a normally-fatal incident which she-miraculously-comes out of alive. Confused, her aunt informs her that she's experienced a phenomenon called \"time leaping,\" a gift, she claims, most girls her age possess at some point in time. Makoto then uses this gift to her own advantage, not realizing that her pleasure is causing those close to her to suffer.Having just watched this movie for the first time, I was surprised how well it was able to take ideas that'd been done before in prior movies (such as Groundhog Day, The Matrix, a Nolan mindf*** movie like Memento and the incredibly-underrated Bruce Almighty) and add enough originality to make it seem new. The Girl Who Leapt Through Time may just be your typical coming-of-age story on the surface, but it's done in a way that males, especially adult males, will get something out of it too. It's got its humour (such as when Makoto tries to leap out her bedroom window and her sister perceives it as attempted-suicide,) its dark moments (such as when Makoto shouts in fear as one of her best-friends and his girlfriend get hit by a train) and its slapstick comedy, all wrapped in a fun package. But where the movie really shines is in its overlying theme of regret when facing the past: far too often we regret the mistakes we've made and wish we could reverse them, but sometimes it's for the best that we can't; besides, even if we COULD change them, would we be satisfied with our revisions?Aside from the beautiful animation and interesting characters, it's also important to take note of the voice-acting. While I know nothing about the original Japanese, at the same time I think the English dub deserves its fair share of credit. It seems that, far too often these days, people snub dubs under the pretext that they butcher what makes the original voice work so special, not stopping to respect the effort that goes into the dubs so that people who can't understand Japanese and/or have trouble with subtitles can appreciate what's being offered. To that end, the English cast is fantastic. I especially have to applaud Emily Hirst, who easily steals the show as Makoto and is a sheer joy to listen to. I also have to applaud her for her very convincing crying moments, as those are very hard for voice actors to do in animated movies. Not only were they well-timed, but they sounded authentic to the point where I can easily see a real person take her place.In the end, this is just another must-see for animation and movie fans. Far too often in the world of anime, directors associate mature with man's insatiable lust for pootytang. With that line of thinking, we often end up with anime movies and shows that are disgusting to both watch and visualize in our mind. To that end, I'm glad that The Girl Who Leapt Through Time doesn't go for such filth, instead challenging our minds and getting us to think about life in general. The film isn't perfect, there were a few parts that got a little grinding to watch, but that doesn't make it any less of a masterpiece. I can't recommend it more.Final Score: 9/10.",

The story revolves around the girl and the events that happens to her, and her meddling with them by leaping through time.There is indeed very little plot and fewer surprises. It is just that, a heartwarming film about teenagers sorting through their emotions. What else needs to be said? The art brings back some nostalgia.

I like movies like this that bring you into atmosphere of peace. The plot is thorough unlike some anime and although there is minor action and no real fight sciences it's a successful modern piece of anime. Enjoy, the film.I enjoyed Mamoru Hosoda work in Samuai Champloo, and look forward to watching Wolfe Children and Summer Wars.I think the art in the films is scenic and serene, and though less dazzling than other films still has beauty of it's own. Other films that I would consider as therapeutic watches are Secret World of Arietty by Hayao Miyazaki, and maybe one with a little more action would be Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.

            "content": "When it comes to Asian animation most people are familiar with Studio Ghibli and the many classics they have made over the decades. So naturally it would be difficult to find anything that both very detailed in animation and as enchanting in the same level as Studio Ghibli. The Girl Who Leapt Through Time might not be as detailed, but its very likable leading character and heartfelt story makes up for it. The Girl Who Leapt Through Time tells the story of a teenage girl who finds that she has the ability to leap through time and tempers around with time to discomforting results. The plot is surprisingly lighthearted for the first half with lots of humor, but the second half on the other hand is more serious. While I did find the second half to be just as good, it wasn't as engaging. It's abrupt going from teenage girl using her power to go back in time prevent her sister from eating her pudding to teenage girl trying to stop her friends from getting run over by a train. The leading character is very charming, smart, funny, strong, and three dimensional like any good female character should be. The other characters are just as likable and you'll start to like them over time thanks to some good writing and character development. The animation is good and appealing to see, but it's not really detail as something like A Cat In Paris or even Akira. Though it does have cool imagery when you the main character leaping through time. The voice acting is pretty good and felt on par with any live-action movie in terms of a delivering emotions. The English dubbing is also very good as well with none of the characters getting on your nerves. The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is a very engaging movie with a heartfelt story to make one memorable experience. While it remains to be seen that this will be as popular as something produce by Studio Ghibli, it's nonetheless just as entertaining and worth watching.",

Though keep in mind, this is coming from someone who expects a lot out of movies that are acclaimed... (an 8/10 on IMDb is decent, though Butterfly Effect has ~100k votes as opposed to around 4-5k votes on this movie) Sure, the movie has great eye candy and is nicely animated. But the characters are deliberately made to be very dim-witted and it's obvious to someone like myself, or someone who's mature enough to tell. The way the characters are so flawed (seemingly deliberately, just to fill a plot that can't fill itself if you know what I mean) remind me so much of how characters from like, 7th Heaven (the American TV show with a bajillion adopted kids in a family). I feel that this is a way for writers to cut corners -- just give the movie some sort of scaffolding just to give the animators something to animate. I can go on and on about the things that really bugged me about the storyline, the characters... lots of the dialogue felt way too much like extremely artificial, meaningless filler to me. The way Makoto was thinking after Chiaki made his confession was very irrational and stupid... and she never really sat down to think and just leaped through time whenever she felt like it, even if in the end she leaped for Chiaki... it just feels like the characters never learned anything fundamental. even after exploring that aspect, there are many other issues brought up that makes this movie so incredibly incomplete as a story -- deliberately vague just to desperately fill up a storyline, like cheating on a long term paper in order to make your essay an extra page long by increasing the font size of the period at the end of a paragraph or something. Very nice animation, but very disappointing story... I only watched this movie because a friend asked me to. Lately I've been kind of avoiding anime because I expect way too much out of story lines, dialogues, character development and just... everything that makes you think and question. if makoto made an entry on fmylife.com during the middle of the movie, I feel that most people would have voted \"you totally deserved it.\" if most people voted \"I agree, your life sucks\" then it probably would have been because of her aunt who just never told her the right stuff (again, just for the sake of driving the storyline someplace...) Good for a younger age group and eye-candy or if you want to just sit back and not think too much -- don't watch it if you expect something remotely profound, witty, smart or innovative out of the storyline.",

            "content": "While I generally don't gravitate toward anime, this movie was interesting. It shares some similarities with Time Traveler's Wife because time is unstable in the sense that the protagonist can only travel back a set number of times. It seems that you absorb the power to time leap from a future device. While she originally uses the time travel to benefit herself she later uses it to help others, ending up by running into another time jumper. So all in all, this movie has a simple but powerful storyline, although it doesn't attempt to make any political points and is bland in that regard.In a lot of ways, this film has drawbacks. It is obviously intended for a young audience and is a bit absurd at times, sometimes to the detriment of the film itself. Even so, there is something compelling, to some extent, about this movie, which is why I gave it a rating of 8 out of 10 rather than 2 out of 10 which I gave the film Roma, to give one example. It reminds me a bit of the 2001 Japanese film, Spirited Away, in some ways, although that film was much stronger than this one.Despite these positive elements I would not watch this film again. The main reason is its overall childishness and lack of themes that connect with wrongs within society as a whole. While the main character obviously has some anxieties about the future, the general nature of society itself is not changed, leading to only small changes which, at first, only benefit the protagonist. With that, my review of this film comes to a close.",

            "content": "Honestly, I have only seen this film twice in my life. I first watched it in 2012 and then later this year. The plot holds up very well over time as it does not rely on animation trick, gimmicks, or tries to do anything more than what I perceive it should.It's about a girl who was going to die because she was being negligent in her life, and through circumstances learns that she can jump through time.What I really liked about this film is that even though the person had super powers, it was more of a curse as life as more of an ebb and flow to it. So taking what seems as a good opportunity might take away something that could have been even better.The animation on the piece was really good for the time; there are clearly sections where dialogue was more important than the animation so they did cut back in quality during those times. But it does not get in the way at all and there are some scenes that are ageless.This is a very heart-full movie and not to be clich\u00e9, but I am a man that typically does not cry and this movie has managed to get me to cry both times I watched it, as it is a really well scripted movie.",

            "review_title": "Spoiler: it's NOT science fiction!",
            "content": "On most sites, this anime is classified as drama, romance, fantasy, comedy and whatnot... Well, what not? Science fiction, it is not! If someone told you so, it's so very much wrong! This is anything but Science Fiction. Have that in mind to not get frustrated. If after that, you still want to know about it, then you may have a nice treat in this film.Although the story is mostly dependent on time travelling, brought by a future time traveller's gimmick, it's not a Science Fiction film. In a way, it is also not a romance, although there is a lot of romantic plots unfolding. Drama? Sure, lots of drama, but that is, just like time travelling, a device for the film.So, what's it all about, you may be asking. My wife and I watched it together, without knowing anything about it. My wife got really upset by the ending, while I got puzzled. It took me a moment to realise it, but my wife got it immediately. She turned to me, with tears on her eyes and a nervous smile, and asked what is it with these Japanese films and their poetic endings?!That's it! It's a poem in form of animated film! It's somewhat more linear than, say, a Terry Gilliam's film, but, like most poems, it's meant to make you feel, not answer your questions.If you haven't seen it and are trying to decide if you would ever, then stop reading this and watch it! After this point, there will be spoilers...Is it worth watching? For me, it was. People watch films for different reasons, like entertainment, insights, emotions, laughs... This one has a little of everything, even many glimpses of a plot, but it's never shown. It will never tell you who the time traveller is, why he decided to travel so \"far\" and, most important (and frustrating), if he will ever meet the protagonist again.If you are the kind of person that needs a story, a plot, a reason why, then maybe this is not the kind of film you are going to like. The lack of that doesn't make this a lesser film, but a different kind, for a different target viewer.Even taking that into account, the film has some flaws. The main flaw is the pace. It starts slow, then takes a sudden leap, then gets sluggish again, before gaining speed and... Almost taking off, because, as I said, it's not Science Fiction, a flying Delorean will never come to rescue the characters, so they have to make through it on their own.The interesting thing about this film is that I watched the credits rolling full of hope, even though, after what my wife said, it was obvious that it would never happen: the time traveller meeting the girl again. A bigger part of me wanted to see that, but another said that it shouldn't, because it's a poem. Showing them meeting would completely destroy the film, and make it fall down from an amazing poem to just another \"sci-fi\" dramatic romantic coming-of-age-y whatever.It's not a film for the masses, although the production comprises wonderful graphics, sound works, voice acting and, on its own way, script. The important part of this film is not the production, though, but the thoughts and feelings embedded in it. I dare you to eat a pudding without recalling this film ever again! Or a nut, for that matter...",

I didn't want to recognize that, so I scored 10 points for both.\nI thought that the process of becoming to love increasingly was very well written. Wrom an ordinary classmates to a special person. This is probably because the scenario writer is a woman. Also, I think that the gradation, which is gradually becoming a serious problem from everyday boring incidents, was well linked. And the climax ... The way to make the climax is basically the same as that of Tomoyo Harada's one. The reaction of young lady who meet the crisis of her lover is so cute. I think the story ideas are elaborate and striking. This director seems to have been sluggish recently, so I hope he can meet a good writer early and start shining again.",

This is so wondrous! Even though there are some anime movies that don't make you shed a tear, they are actually suggestive and thought-provoking!I've been wanting to watch this film for a while, and, finally, I got it! I did like how the storyline was elaborated, and there were several ideas that make you look at certain situation in your life from a different angle. Incredible ending, thoughtful plot, mature mindfulness in every scene!Spectacular piece of art!",

            "content": "The surprising thing about this animation is that it conveys more emotion than a full 2-hour movie. It's impressive because every line of dialogue actually serves a purpose. At the same time, it's funny, tragic, philosophical, melancholic and accompanied by beautiful landscapes.The plot is easy enough to follow for a time travel movie but it gets really confusing towards the end. The consensus I think is that everything is left ambiguous and every theory you may find to explain some stuff in the movie can be countered by the same stuff from the movie. So just enjoy for what it is. A coming of age story through the eyes of a time traveler.As for the animation, it's really beautiful. The scenery sometimes gives off a vibe of serenity as only a time traveler can feel. Time is stopped and you're there in the present, not worrying about the future or the past because you already know it. It's totally in contrast with the character of Makoto who is a clumsy person with a very short attention span always running towards... well, towards everything.The end of the movie finds a changed Makoto but not in a 100% sudden change as you can see in Hollywood movies. She's still her, the same one at the beginning, only a little wiser, like all time travelers.I prefer a clear scientific explanation for most movies but here, the producers went with \"plot holes are part of the story\" concept and they choose this intentionally. Watch the animation for what it is, a beautiful exercise in high-school time travel. (where the high school students don't try to do stupid stuff)",

            "content": "If you suddenly gained the ability to quite literally leap through time, what would you use it for? The sheer fun of it? Getting better grades? Or something else? What if you merely wanted the present to continue; to still live out those memorable days with your friends, playing around and having fun; rejecting the future and not wanting things to change? In the movie, a girl is presented with this exact possibility. She suddenly finds out that she has been granted the ability to travel through time, and uses this ability for the purposes mentioned above. At first she tries to correct all the mistakes she made that same day she got the ability; from preventing making a mess out of things in cooking class to dodging people being hurled towards her. And before soon, she tries to keep the times from changing, undoing love confessions and other events which can change her and her two friends' lives.However, everything has a consequence.Even the seemingly most insignificant and puerile of acts can have grave consequences, as such acts are often made out of ignorance or selfishness; both which are traits that rarely bring out a good result if actions are based on them. Our heroine has to learn this the hard way, as she sees how fateful her so-called insignificant acts are, and how wrong she is in her childish beliefs. What she want is merely to keep the fun times around; with her and her two beloved friends. She wants time to stop, to remain in the present. However, time is inexorable; the future is relentlessly closing in on us. And she has to learn this the hard way. But she learns. Through hardships, through death, and most important of all, through love, she learns that the future is not something to be avoided. Rather it is something to be cherished; something one should embrace.And that is the basics of the plot and characters in this story; a girl who repeatedly travels back in time to keep the times as they are, and actually learns during this process that it is better to look forward and into the future rather than intransigently dwell on the present. Her two friends aren't focused on that much, but both are portrayed beautifully when they are, both the though-shelled Chiaki and the obliging Kousuke. Accompanying the beautiful plot is a standard-fare movie animation; which means beautiful and detailed landscapes, cityscapes and backgrounds. And while character movements are fluid, the designs themselves are a bit lackluster, and should have been more detailed. The soundtrack which follows on top is equally beautiful, with serene piano tracks accompanying the at times laughter-provoking and at times melancholy story, and a somewhat expected, yet beautiful ending theme.It's a beautiful movie, which is good for many things, but especially its underlying hints about looking towards the future and accepting that the present will change as well as the simple message that every act has a consequence; especially childish and ignorant acts at that. And even if such themes does not interest you, I think this beautiful story is well worth spending one and a half hour of your life watching.",

The story telling is fantastic I wouldn't say it wasn't the best but really please do watch it, you will not be disappointed. Just to remind it's just a movie so doesn't expect a lot from it but it sure is good on whatever it wants to convey. Makoto is a very free spirited character and does what she likes. She has two good friends. These are some of the most important things a person needs to have otherwise its simply not worth living in this society. The story is of course about time travel but will not bother you much as it is kind of a requirement, there is not much mystery or hype about it so its good thing about the movie. In simple terms please don't focus on time travel but on other aspects of the movie.",
