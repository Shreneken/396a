            "content": "Having watched the regular release version I was somewhat confused as to what was going on, though I was able to surmise the base elements of the plot, but when I saw the uncut version with the scenes left in, things made a lot more sense.The plot seems a bit obscure at first; unless you're sharp, you're not going to be able to follow it. That is all I will say about that.It's true the acting wasn't magnificent but I really don't know what everyone is complaining about. Plenty of action, yes, and Milla Jovovich looks great. I thought it was a pretty good watch myself, and I am in the minority there. I definitely don't think it's a waste of time, though it is a bit dark. It's now in my DVD collection, in fact.Rent it, watch the uncut version. Though not my favourite movie of all time, I enjoyed it.",

            "content": "Good watch, could watch again, and can recommend.This is certainly something different. It's a different approach to vampires (hemophages), it's a different approach to sci-fi, and it's a different approach to corporate dystopia. Oddly, the Umbrella Corporation from \"Resident Evil\" is the closest of which I can think.Milla Jovovich is entirely capable of performing high action sequences, and carrying the movie, which she does wonderfully. I don't doubt that she has some pull in the production process, but the problems in this are mostly the weak character work and the \"I have this really cool idea I'd like to do on screen, it'll be totally different than anything else out there.\" of it all.Some of it (nose plugs) are actively distracting, and other things are just odd choices (squared off sword), while there are cool concepts (dimensionally printed weapons), and scenes that just look cool even if they're not especially practical or sensisble (swords on fire in the dark).My only personal gripes are day walking vampires, weird foley sounds for the guns (most are right, but it is hard to tell on made up guns), and why in the hell people with guns would charge someone instead of firing.I think this movie holds up as good as it did when it was released, and I have a good time re-watching it.",

            "content": "In the future research into a rare blood anomaly has gotten out of control, making it more infectious and deadly than nature ever did. It spreads. The world become split between the uninfected humans and those infected who have developed the traits of the vampires of old. Known as Hemophages, they fight back in a war led by Daxus as head of the new totalitarian world. In the middle of this war is Violet, a Hemophage whose infection lost her child. Violet steals a secret weapon from Daxus to return to her people. However when the weapon turns out to be a human child with a mutation in his blood Violet hesitates. She goes on the run with the child but both sides seem determined to kill her and her ward.This film got roundly harsh reviews when it came out in cinemas and it maintains an equally low rating on IMDb but, arrogant as I am, I thought it might be a piece of mindless fun. Well, I'm sad to say that my hope proved to have no founding in reality. It isn't that the film is really bad, because it isn't. It is more than it doesn't really follow through on anything or do anything that well and the result is a rather messy and inconsequential film that I really struggled to feel anything strong about whatsoever \u0096 not a sense of fun, excitement, interesting or even hate.The plot is the first obstacle to get over as it exists in a world that, as Violet first says, is hard to understand. On the surface it is a typical totalitarian state with disease and war at its core and thus surely would offer some potential for commentary on our modern society (OK maybe not V for Vendetta but perhaps something). Sadly no, nothing like that is to be found and instead the world is one of assumptions and half-baked ideas from other sources. This is a minor problem compared to my main issue with it though. Others have picked holes in the specifics but for me it all falls over because it simply takes itself too seriously. On one hand it is a comic book movie with excessive action and loads of (rather obvious) CGI but on the other we get loads of heavy moments that just clunk their way across the screen.It could have gone either way and have been better for it. It could have been more fun and a bit less full of itself \u0096 embracing the comic book style and making the CGI look part of the \"unreal\" effect rather than leaving them to stand out by looking a bit cheap, like they couldn't match everything else due to budget constraints. Conversely it could have gone more adult, properly explored the maternal theme and developed the characters beyond the one dimensional but then I guess that would have risked the teen action crowd. However by trying to do neither and both at the same time the end result is a bit messy. I could go on but I'll leave others to tell you about the clunky script, roundly flat acting and disjointed story but suffice to say they are correct \u0096 nothing is really done well here.Even the action, which surprised me. Some scenes offer excitement but mostly they are all overdone and full of too many baddies and an inability to keep the camera still for longer than a second to let us enjoy what we are seeing or feel close to it. The one scene I did think was well done was the conclusion; not brilliant because it still suffered from excess but the darkness and the 1-on-1 (as opposed to 700-on-1) did at least make me get into it a bit. Jovovich has a good body and is not a \"bad\" actress here but really she does offer little more than the basics. Any vague attempt she does make to find the person in her character is either misjudged or ignored and all we are left with is the sight of her in tight clothes killing people while looking sexy; perfect for the teenage boy market but those days are a decade or so behind me and I just felt bored. Bright is dull while I can only assume that Fichtner hoped for a franchise and took a role that would potentially give him an expansion potential in later films (yeah William, drop me a line and let me know how that's working out for ya). Chinlund at least has the good taste to furiously ham it up; maybe it is because he is a ham or maybe it was a decision but either way at least he has a bit of fun and his character never gets sucked into being dry and serious like the rest of the film (he's still not great though).Overall, not as bad as some would have you believe but certainly no earthly good either. The approach is mixed and mostly fails to inspire, excite, engage or even interest. I would have liked to see it try to do something in particular \u0096 be silly, be clever, be childish, be adult \u0096 something. Hell, I might even have liked it if it had been such a shambles that it became fun to mock. As it is though it is just totally mediocre, boring, flat and uninspiring. Even teenage boys deserve better.",

So wait for this film to come out on DVD, because the shorten 88 minute verison of the film will totally disappoint everyone.

            "content": "\u00b6Despite what some might say, Ultraviolet is actually pretty decent movie. It's unique and original in one area: In most \"vampire fare\", vampires are immortal beings, but in Ultraviolet, hemophages (which are for all intents and purposes vampires) are not immortal. Instead, the virus which causes them to become hemophages significantly shortens their lifespan, 12 years infection to death.\n\u00b6Milla Jovovich is a gem. Some of her character, including Violet really are heavyweights where badass females are concerned. Violet is so sassy and adorable. Ultraviolet has Milla jovovich, William Fichtner, and Nick Chinlund, all of whom are great actors and their acting prowess is shown very well in the movie.\n\u00b6The choice of sets and costumes are superb and flamboyant for lack of a better term. The score is unique and although it has some orchestral elements, it's definitely not a conventional orchestral score. I know nothing of cinematography. That being said, the visuals are outstanding.\n\u00b6In Ultraviolet, there is a disease which comes from the far east and frightens many people into wearing masks. I wonder where I have heard that before. :P :D\n\u00b6Ultraviolet's plot and story-line are creative, but not necessarily completely, totally, and utterly unique. The fight scenes should be slower and more graphic. That's about it as far as problems I have with the movie",

            "content": "Ultraviolet was embarrassingly terrible on so many levels. My husband and I usually really dig the comic book and action movies, so I think that our expectations were reasonable for the genre. The kinds of movies that Ultraviolet tried to channel were X-Men, The Matrix and Underworld. Unfortunately, this movie failed to do so.1) Dialogue was laughably bad. One of Milla's lines was actually \"Because these beautiful moments turn evil when they're over.\" What?? This was regarding a romantic pass made at her. Totally incongruous with the setting. 2) Excessive use of CGI is a personal irritant. Additionally, the motorcycle chase scenes were only one step above TRON. I might as well have been watching my 11 year old neighbors play some video game. 3) Zero character development. I didn't care about Violet, the french guy, the scientist guy, the pretty boy, or the evil nose filter guy. I didn't care about their individual goals (mainly because they weren't very clear). I didn't care about characters dying, and I didn't care about the revelation at the end; the only indicator that I had that it was important was her somewhat awed reaction.To be fair, Milla Jovovich has an incredible face and body and is well-suited for fight scenes. If all-CGI, all-the-time is your thing, then you'll be thrilled with the loads of glossed-over fight scenes involving Milla and hordes of green screen baddies. If you're like our entire theater, you're bored. Really, fake fights just don't impress me.",

            "review_title": "Great imagination and visual style, but unjustly compared to bigger movies",
            "content": "The worst part about Ultraviolet is that it has THREE genres of movies to compete with. People will compare it to the blockbusters of Sci-Fi movies, Martial Arts movies, and Heroine movies. It will have a tough time trying to stand out when people will inevitably compare it to HUGE movies like Crouching Tiger, The Matrix, Kill Bill, Underworld, etc.Let's remember that Ultraviolet had a relatively small budget, and yet it did quite a bit with it. With all that said, let me say a few words, good and bad ones, on Ultraviolet.Yes, the story in Ultraviolet is its weakest point. The problem is in the lack of emotional attachment to the characters, the odd choice and delivery of lines (although you can't deny how great the \"It is on.\" line is), and the strange dream-like stuff it goes into at times.A lot of the themes in this movie are very fleeting, maybe because they've just been done so often, they need no emphasis. There's one particular story element that you might miss ENTIRELY if you didn't pay attention during one shot. That's how little emphasis there is on story in this movie. The plot is also a little hard to follow at times because it jumps around.It's strange to see so little emphasis on the story when we know from Equilibrium that Kurt Wimmer is very capable of writing a good story. It makes me wonder if the lack of story was intentional or not, but the unfortunate bottom line is that it hurts this movie.So what saves this movie? Why 8 out of 10? If we were interested in movies only for their story, we wouldn't be interested in movies at all...we would all read books instead.Yes, a movie is defined as picture and sound. In that case, Ultraviolet is quite an amazingly interesting picture and sound.Ultraviolet sacrifices story for a very visceral picture and oodles of style. I haven't seen a movie that looks this COOL in a long time. It really reminds me of the type of style that 60's sci-fi movies were going for- very robust in color and costumes, but modernized and expanded for our time. It's certainly a very nice departure from the typical and BORING space station/stainless steel/green look of modern sci-fi.The action is kick-ass, applause-worthy at times...although I'll admit that I've seen a bit better from similarly-budgeted movies (\"Versus\" comes to mind). They could've had some more variety to it (like maybe some better/badder foes), but considering who and what they were working with, I think they did a good job.Another big strength of the movie is the very cool concepts. Color-changing outfits, gravity belts, disposable paper cellphones, crazy ninjas that drop out of planes like giant pinballs, and entire weapon arsenals stored in wrist devices. All of it with designer-quality fashion to it. You can tell where the budget went in this movie. Like I said, it's an older, weirder, more stylish sense of sci-fi that you don't see very often these days. In fact, a lot of this movie can be defined as set-pieces more so than a single flowing experience.True, their ability to execute some of these ideas (specifically, the motorcycle chase) is limited by their budget. I think it can be overlooked, though. Some rough edges on CG never hurt anybody...anybody that wants to whine about the graphics really doesn't want to appreciate the movie for what it is.Overall, I enjoyed this movie, more so for its visuals, music, concepts and set-pieces than for its story or characters. It's really quite interesting to look at. There are more moments in this movie that make me think 'awesome!' than in all of The Matrix trilogy. If this movie isn't a success, then I hope it at least inspires the movie that does get this particular formula just right.",

It has some potential, the action sequences look a little mundane as we have seen it all before but they are quick and effective. The story is quirky enough to be interesting and some of the backdrops look good.The problem is, Ultraviolet neither makes sense nor holds together as a film. Huge chunks of action and story seem to have been lost on the cutting room floor. The film is left overloaded with the expensive bits that had already been paid for. Lots of sweeping city-scapes and shots of Mila walking down corridors don't make a film.It reminds me of other Japanese live action Manga smash-ups (See Kasshern etc). The problem is that Japanese films have every right not to make sense and be completely over the top, as it is what they do best. Unfortunately, due to a westernised need for slight reality, Hollywood have attempted same thing and ended up with a cheap looking film with a poor script stuck together with a bunch of crap one liners.",

            "content": "After having been given repeated warnings about how bad this film is, I went ahead and watched a borrowed copy. About thirty minutes into the film I had reached a decision: I was enjoying it. While certainly not Oscar-winning material, most people apparently were expecting some kind of cinematic masterpiece rather than what they got, an over-the-top comic book-like action set piece with a modicum of plot to tie together the action sequences.The gunkata sequences, closer to Wimmer's original idea of the form, do not approach the stark and yet orgiastic death-art of Equilibrium, but they're fun all the same. The movie is full of neat, if improbable, gadgetry, from gravity manipulators to disposable paper cell phones. Nick Chinlund chews a satisfactory amount of scenery without stuffing himself down the viewer's throat. Milla Jovovich herself manages to use a two-dimensional role to display probably the most range I've ever seen her give outside of \"The Messenger\", and she was certainly much more attractive in this movie than in any of the others I've ever watched her in. All these things contribute to what amounted to a popcorn bowl of a film: not something you'd eat for every meal, but a nice snack for a change of pace when you don't want something too substantial.The problem seems to be that most people can't just shut off their brains and enjoy a romp once in a while. Would this film ever seriously contend for Best Anything? No. But it certainly does not deserve the almost universal slagging it has gotten since its release.

Milla Jovovich's hair and jacket change colors for no discernible reason throughout the film. I think the pretty colors are supposed to distract us from the incoherent script, but it doesn't work. The Sky Captain-style post-processing just makes everything look blurry. (And why is it applied to only half the shots?) Just about everything in this movie is borrowed from something else, and it's slapped together on the thinnest of premises and tarted up with lots of CGI. When there's a break from the ridiculously-choreographed action sequences, the audience is bludgeoned with nonsensical subplots and indescribably awful dialogue. By the time the heroine met the villain in their final showdown, the audience in my theater was laughing out loud.If you appreciate Milla Jovovich's body, it might be possible to enjoy this film by renting the DVD and watching it with the sound off and your techno MP3 collection blaring in the background while you do something productive, like picking the gunk out from beneath your toenails.

The CGI however was excellent (except for the last scene, I guess they ran out of money)and probably the most interesting part of the movie. The action which is why I saw the movie suffered from repetition: from the characters, to the setups (Violet is being attacked when she is out-numbered), to the moves, unnecessary sword fighting when they have guns with bullets, unnecessarily repetitive situations (big circle everyone attacks at once and violet wins with ease no challenging battle), and a lack of depth.

What it also features which most people will unknowingly pass by. Is a huge social- political subtext with stabs at religion and disease control. Jovovich in a color changing outfit and hair style stars as Violet a young woman who was accidentally turned into a hemophage. The futuristic term for vampire, after the government created a virus that went a muck and ended up infecting a huge portion of the population. After being quarantined, experimented on and her pregnancy terminated she joins the hemophages in a war against humans. Enter Six played confidently by Cameron Bright a young boy whose also a weapon he holds an antogen that can destroy the population. Needless to say everyone is after him, Violet is on her own and protecting him. It's pretty standard stuff but there is a strong maternal instinct seen between the two actors and makes the film much more important. Also separating the film form the usual Hollywood garbage is a undeniable subtext about society. There's a huge religious emphasis in the film from the appearance of crucifixes, color schemes and stigmata. Along with that comes the decision to rally the infected into camps where they disappear courtesy of the gov't. Because after becoming infected your no longer deemed human by society's standards. Also the creation of a virus to control the population is scary stuff but is it really so far from reality. The film asks probing questions sugar coated with flashy action sequences and wondrous cinematography and that is. Utterly breathtaking. From the vivid colors to the camera dynamics the film represents a completely new step in the right direction. As a whole it's a completely original experience. Sadly, most people won't see it as so. Distracted by some bad acting, the unbelievability of the scenario, some hammy dialogue and the disbelief that hot chicks kick butt. People will be turned off.

For most of the movie, she is out to kick butt.Needless to say, the action is highly artificial. Violet makes fighting evil look as easy as 1, 2, 3. It takes her about half a second to kill ten people, so in order to stretch things out, the fights are either in slow motion or they show her taking out fifty people.A more competent part of Ultraviolet is the set-design. Anyone been to Disneyland? did you ride Space Mountain? If you've had the honor of standing in the two hour line to board, you probably would have had plenty of time to look at the decoration of the queue. Pretty spiffy huh? For a moment you'd actually think you are on a space station. If anything I've just said makes any sense to you, than you'll have an Idea of what Ultraviolet looks like, lots of neon lighting. Director Kurt Wimmer and his costume designer clearly could not figure out which color Violet looks best in, red? black? white? yellow? or of course violet. When you run into that kind decision making problem in life, the solution is simple, why not try them all, which is what happens. A lot of people are calling this a bad film. I didn't think it was terrible, but it is obvious where the movie is flawed. The question then becomes whether the movie is sexy enough to ignore the flaws. I leave it to you to watch it and decide for yourself.",

And thus, I cant make a solid judgment on it just yet. Its actually the studio's cut that made the film bad for me. For a comic book movie based on a comic book that never existed, the film more than delivers. And I believe thats what they wanted to make in the first place, an original COMIC BOOK MOVIE.Its just a shame they cut 30 mins of the plot and the movie looks like a big plot hole to everybody, cause if these weren't cut, everything would make perfect sense, and each extraordinary thing you see on the screen would be clearly justified. Same with the fast cuts in the action, thats again someone else's mess definitely not wimmer's.This movie had so much potential, and it would be unfair to only blame wimmer for it's major flaws.Even with this cut, I enjoyed it, it was fun, bright, with vivid colors had something original about it, that people cant just at least admit. And no its not the worst film i have ever seen. Its actually a misunderstood film with its highs and lows and if it wasn't cut to death, it would have been a another cult classic like EQ was before it.",

With the right budget, the right director and time, it could have been the best film of the year. Otherwise, it will leave you feeling like something's been left out. What I liked was the fact I went for a cheesy, mass-action, campy, comic-book/video game movie. I expected fighting, explosions, gratuitous scenes with some nudity and a minimal plot. No, this isn't plot intensive like Silent Hill. (Again, an underlying feature that could have been better handled). So, if you're like me, and you enjoy seeing Milla do her thang, faceless soldiers being under mass slaughter and needless, gratuitous violence, then this is the film for you. Of course, I look for this type of movie only once per year. Just as a break from everything else. The quota has been filled!",

            "content": "I really am speechless in trying to describe how I felt about Ultraviolet.In some respects, I think I truly wasted ninety-plus minutes of my life watching this movie.In others, I am just terribly disappointed with Kurt Wimmer, who gave us the excellent cult film Equilibrium just four years ago.But Ultraviolet, well, Ultraviolet attempts to clone the successful points of any number of science-fiction films that have come before it. Only it fails miserably in all respects. Yes, it could easily be pinned on Sony for tampering with the film and taking out so many vital plot points. But even with what's left, I cannot fathom how this movie could have been all that great to start with.The film is just an incomprehensible mess. Explaining it here would just waste even more time, but suffice to say, Milla Jovovich is Violet, a member of a mutant race that has practically been wiped off the face of the planet. She is sent to illegally intercept a weapon that is being touted to further destroy the race, and is told not to open it. Being a rebel, she does, and finds a human boy named Six (Cameron Bright). Everyone seems to want him dead, so she takes it upon herself to try and protect him from just about everyone.Original? Far from it, and this is the problem. The material has been done before, and has been done much better. Everyone involved seem to know it, and they are just seemingly trying to deliver something that does not totally reek of being clich\u00e9d unoriginal filth. But that is exactly what this is. Jovovich for one reason or another, is invincible, and just kills everything in sight without batting an eye. And since she can do this, she can save the boy from just about any situation. So at a crucial moment when he needs to be saved, what is the audience to think? That she's going to fail? How are we supposed to feel sympathetic for characters who are so unoriginal that we can tell what is going to happen miles before it actually does? But therein lies another problem - the film does not make any sense. In their infinite wisdom, the editors took out more than a handful of vital plot points needed to really flesh out the characters and the story. As it is, the characters involved seem to have ongoing relationships that the audience only can grasp mention of, they never know the specifics. They just kind of go place-to-place, and it is assumed that the audience will just forget the fact that there is little to no mention of what anyone is doing, just that Jovovich is kicking ass and taking names almost every five minutes. There is no real cohesive storyline to follow at any point. We just get pieces of what was once Wimmer's script, and the film just kind of assumes that those who truly want to make sense of the movie, will just use their imaginations. Is this a good enough reason to blatantly miss key points needed to fully grasp the later actions and events involving some characters? No, and whoever thought so needs to get their heads examined.On top of a story with no sensical values, the acting and dialogue is pretty terrible too. The few lines within the film are short and sweet. And they do nearly nothing to move the plot. Some of Jovovich's voice-overs do indeed work, but only sparingly (albeit much better than some of her \"classy\" one-liners like \"Watch me\", which she repeats about five times). At least with the voice-overs, we do not get to see any acting. When we actually see her physically speaking, Jovovich is just totally unenthused with everything. She has no excitement in her voice, and she has a total lack of any caring for even attempting to make her desire to protect Six look real. Indeed she is not that great an actress to start, but she is only continuing to perpetuate that notion with her deplorable acting here.Bright is not all that much better. He has a whole total of three minutes of dialogue in the film (but plenty of screen time), and it is all delivered with the intensity of a gargoyle statue. It is so bland and so wooden that you begin to wonder why they even bothered to cast anyone in this role in the first place. Nick Chunland and William Fichtner are not all that much better, but at least the majority of their acting is delivered with some sort of inclination of attempting to act. Sorry to say, they do not appear all that much in the film.The visuals for the most part, attempt to save the film from complete annihilation, but only work to a point. Yes, they are vibrant and exhilarating, but they never really pique interest. Some of the costumes and sets are downright ridiculous looking, and only continue to beat the film down into being worse. The special effects are titillating in one respect, but in others, they just look like a bad rip-off of something else. What is worse is the fact that the majority of them look like they are lifted right out of a video game (even down to some sequences of first person shooter). The crazed and bizarre editing helps accomplish this feat, and while it was meant to look stylish, it just ends up looking goofy.For all its faults, the film does have a few intriguing moments. It has a few moments where it also proves that it could have been good if it had better direction, and a much better editor. If Sony was thinking the action alone would save this movie from being a laughing stock of putrid trash, then they clearly need to rethink their position as a Hollywood studio. And fast.1/10.",

The first one certainly is the awful screenplay, with a bad story, silly dialogs and no development of the characters.

I mean, it was just something like so out there, and so hard to believe. It was difficult to believe, and so it was so unbelievable.\" or \"Woooooooooooooo! Kachew! Kachew!\" At times, Mila may seem to go silent for 5 minutes or so. Don't worry, it isn't your DVD player. Mila is just waiting for something to happen in the movie so that she can talk about.

Then the film calms down for a little breather until the next amazing fight sequence. Following a holocaust some humans have become Hemophages, a sub-species with enhanced physical abilities. Violet, must protect a nine-year-old boy who has been marked for death by the human government.In the wake of 2005's disappointing Aeon Flux, underrated Kurt Wimmer director of Equilibrium (2002) writer of The Recruit (2003) and Salt (2010) set about creating an up-to-the-minute Sci-fi.However, after shooting wrapped Kurt left after being pressured to deliver less emotional PG-13 rated film. In turn, Ultraviolet was completely re-edited by the studio and apparently this marred the finished product significantly.Acting wise, William Fichtner puts in an unusual performance, Sebastien Andrieu and Nick Chinlund both seem unsure what's going on. With an abundance of forgettable bad guys, Milla Jovovich excellently plays Violet who has enhanced speed, incredible stamina and acute intelligence. Her character at first seems very one dimensional as she plays her usual Resident Evil kick-ass self. But even in the short running time her character develops, you're given glimpses into here past, as she bonds with 'Six' played well by Cameron Bright.There's great effects, stunts and a thumping score. A lot of reviews have criticised the CGI usage, however, it's stylised, hyper-real and sleek. It's not meant to be faithful representation of a real world. Holograms, swords, a new invented language, gun-fighting and martial arts. It's science fiction entertainment, set in the 21st century, nothing more, nothing less.It's fast, it's fun - Ultraviolet is an pleasing sci-fi action but possibly could have been so much more if Wimmer was allowed to deliver his cut.",

Its great stuff which operates nicely with in its own on screen world. It helps that this is a movie in motion, its basically a 90 minute chase with some fights and exposition thrown in from time to time. The fights defy gravity and make your jaw hang open in disbelief (the good kind). The wonder of it all is to due to clever deus ex machina or mc guffins with in the story (vampirism and neat gadgets) and they help keep things moving along at a good clip. Actually the film has enough slack to explain (or not) pretty much everything satisfactorily until the final twenty minutes or so when it becomes clear that some one removed several lines of exposition. Its still good, but you will feel that you've missed something.I have to say that I like that the film doesn't feel it has to show you everything. some of the fights happen in the dark or bodies will pile up just out of view. Its a ballsy film that allows that to happen since it trusts its audience to fill in what just happened based on the after math. Fight fans may squawk, but I liked it.I accepted the film on its own terms and allowed it to work its magic so I liked it.

Milla Jovovich is very beautiful, I like action movies, and the time it was playing suited my schedule.I was expecting the movie to be bad because action movies with a female protagonist always are. Hollywood must think Americans aren't into action-chick movies like this and don't want spend the money/time/effort into making these movies as good as they can be. Within the first 5 minutes, I was completely engrossed and shocked by how good it was.This movie was a pleasant surprise because someone did sweat the details for a change. The fight scenes were very well choreographed. The special effects and stunts were unique. The plot was unique. The acting was great. The film was the right length and the pacing was perfect. The setting was futuristic and funky looking. I've never seen a movie quite like this one and, in this day and age, it's very rare, unfortunately, to see a movie that isn't just like every other one out there.Milla Jovovich is amazing. She is beautiful and she somehow manages to come across as being feminine AND tough at the same time. It's a delicate balance and something hardly any actress can pull off.So why not a ten then? The film moves very fast and if you blink you may miss something which can make a scene confusing. After I left the theater, we discussed the plot and \"compared notes\" to help each other fill in the grey areas. If a little more time was spent dropping easy to follow clues, it would make things easier to follow for the average American.

Only years later did I watch it again & suddenly realize what an original and effective film it is.In a nutshell, this is a comic book. It captures the essence of those great old rags you grew up with as a kid and puts it in motion. Unlike other comic book film *adaptations* which try to put the story in a real-world context, making it more believable, rational & dramatic, ULTRAVIOLET goes in the opposite direction and stays true to the art form of comic bookery. The fantastic irony is that this movie isn't even based on a comic book. The comic book stylings were a pure invention by director/writer Kurt Wimmer, and if you didn't google it like I did, you'd be none the wiser that he just pulled a fast one on you.It's with that same playful spirit that the whole film should be approached. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT take it seriously. Don't whip out a magnifying glass to look for loopholes, scientific impossibilities or lapses in logic. If you've ever read a comic book, you should know that the whole genre is based on preposterous, logic-defying, irrational idealism. People defy gravity. Guns never run out of bullets. Corpses don't bleed or spill guts all over the floor like you might see in Platoon. Characters' dialogue and reactions are delightfully predictable and clich\u00e9 (including the awesome line \"You're all going to die\"). And the superhero has a perfect body with expertly choreographed moves (with the gorgeous Milla Jovovich in the lead role, is anyone complaining?).You could almost view this as a satire, similar to Catch-22 or Starship Troopers, except that there is no satire. Hence my title \"tongue-in-cheek without the tongue\". This is just straightforward fun wrapped up in a candy package. In that vein, I rate this as one of the best comic book films out there (almost as good as the Japanese film \"Cutie Honey\"). Watch it & relive those nostalgic memories of growing up with a stack of DC & Marvel comic books. Or if you never had that experience, it's never too late.

Let me break this down for you.Plot: There is none really. Violet has some kind of ultra-contagious plague that the government is trying to eliminate. Even though it's so contagious that BREATHING THE SAME AIR can infect you. So half the people run around with gas masks. The lead \"bad guy\" is so obsessive that he buys his GUNS in sealed plastic bags. Which just makes NO sense when you get to the end of the movie. At one point there is a 10 minute (or less) love interest between Violet and some random vampire. No character development, so don't worry about paying attention. Did I mention that there seem to be virtually NO bad side effects to this \"plague\"? You become super strong, super fast, and super pretty much everything. There are vague references in the movie about Violet \"dying\" but this isn't really adequately explained so I'm gonna assume since she never DOES die (unfortunately), that it can't be that hard to avoid. They keep using \"holograms\" as an excuse to build false suspense...but nobody really cares because the movie is just such a pile of crap that I was just blankly staring at the screen at this point.Graphics: sub par and over hyped. As an example: For some reason these \"vampires\" who are being hunted to the brink of extinction buy a belt that has a SUN trapped inside it for fusion power...this somehow lets violet drive her motorcycle sideways across a building while being shot at by a helicopter (something about gravity powers). She kills the two pilots and this is apparently enough to make the helicopter explode. The whole time I was watching this, I was bored. HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN? The graphics are SO cheesy that you simply cannot suspend your disbelief. Parts of it just look like a violent Toy Story. Not that I dislike Toy Story, but the point is, the CGI graphics in it should NOT be combined with live action.I can't go on...this movie was the worst thing I've ever seen.it is worse than Plan 9 from outerspace.For the love of ALL that is holy, do NOT see it.",

The disease doesn't actually transform people into vampires but rather sharp teethed people with heightened senses and abilities, as well as extremely short life spans. Violet being a vampire has chosen to fight against the humans who seek to destroy them in order to eliminate the virus.What amazes me about this movie was the fact that just like ''Sin City'' and ''Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow'', this movie is made mostly(more like entirely) of 3d. I personally thought that the combination of real actors, 3d effects and 3d environment strengthened the action and visuals of the movie. What also surprised me was the incredible shifting between different colors in the movie. The colors will literally change in the environment and everyone in it, depending on what happens during the movie. Violet and the sets will change from red to yellow, to blue and back and forth again and again, freshening up the visuals in the movie. The action sequences draw heavily from ''Equlibrium'', but since that was a great movie and Kurt Wimmer also wrote that movie that only helps keep you entertained. I'm not going to say that all of these 3d special effects were hard to make, and I will openly admit that this is a low budget movie, but I still recommend this movie and asks everyone who reads this review and watches the movie, to understand that and keep an open mind.Watch this movie or buy it on DVD, you will not regret it in my opinion",

The argument is pathetic, the actors are horrible (except Milla Jovovich) and the assembly and the writing are too idiot. Only the acceptable thing of this film is the beautiful actress Milla Jovovich. This film tries to be a mixture between \"The Matrix\", \"Kill Bill\" and \"Underworld\".But it can't to be like these films. Too many martial arts and too many actors doing the idiot make this film a rubbish. Violet is a woman who has become a more intelligent being, fast and strong mutant than humans. She hates the humans, reason why she decides to annihilate them and to take revenge of who created her. In her fight, she founds a human boy, Six, that is able to maintain to the mutants like Violet alive.After all,this is a really boring film that has too much action and can becomes eternal. Please,don't go to watch this rubbish,you WILL hate it. If you hope to see a film as \"Kill Bill\" or \"The Matrix\", don't watch this one.",

I'm a zombie man, myself but this is a lavishly colored, beautiful movie with good special effects and I'm glad I finally took the time to watch it. If it didn't have Milla in it, I'd have given it a 7 because some of the visual effects didn't work, I've seen more dramatic and more exciting movies and because the soundtrack sounds so much like the soundtrack to Robocop that it seems almost plagerized.

The movie gives you a strange feeling about the possibilities of modern special effects. The colours have been digitally adapted and it gives you a strange surreal feeling. There are not much dialogs but this is the strenght of the adaptions from graphic novels, the pictures or scenes are more in the focus than the spoken words. I liked it.",

            "content": "This is a review of the unrated extended cut on DVD. I liked the little sci-fi concepts thrown in such as flatspace (void where you can store huge amounts of stuff without showing or weighing you up), changing costume/hair colors and gravity defying devices (letting motorcycles ride on walls). I liked the fight scenes where you often saw the Violet character surrounded by dozens of guys. They were a spectacular mix of different martial arts, gun-play, swordplay and rhythmic gymnastics (as learned in the extras). The battle on the rooftop against the Chinese where Violet doesn't strike a blow and continually avoids bullets was great. Camera work was bold and original with very nice work on reflective surfaces such as tears or glasses.However, the computer special effects sometimes looked fake (witness the plane or the helicopter a few times) and the nice futuristic cityscapes were eerily empty distracting from immersion. I didn't particularly care for the story that could have been tragic if well told (because of Violet's background and the dying infected) as it seemed like an afterthought between the fight scenes. I didn't feel as if Violet was really in jeopardy, her trials felt flat. As for Milla Jovovitch's performance, she was faithful to her reputation and delivered action-wise looking very fit (what an amazing belly!) while showing lots of intensity in her eyes while her line delivery could have been better. All in all, Ultraviolet is not so bad as the critics made it out to be. It has neat sci-fi concepts, somewhat exciting action but lacks in story and emotional involvement. In the sci-fi/super female hero sub-genre, it would be below Aeon Flux and above Catwoman.Rating: 5 out of 10 (average)",

They try to incorporate unbelievable advanced technology with a more modern day looking setting so the two aspects clash. They can make weapons materialize in their hands but their form of infection control is still rubber gloves. The plot itself is kind of hard to follow and doesn't seem to make any sense at times. How vampires fit into the movie, i have no idea.I signed up to IMDb for the sole purpose of warning anyone who wants to see this movie. This movie was horrible and do not waste a dime on this movie.

Said child's blood would restore these \"vampires\" to their \"human\" forms, thus restoring a semblance of peace in Kurt Wimmer's dystopian future. Note the quotation marks: I use them because the \"vampires\" display no potentially exciting bloodsucking qualities, and because, due to some acting flaws, the \"humans\" similarly display no obvious \"human\" qualities. If you aren't totally put off yet, then you should be, because it is exactly as preposterous as it sounds. Despite its inherent ridiculousness it starts off relatively well. For twenty minutes, things explode and a variety of exciting methods of transportation are used, including helicopters and motorbikes, allowing the film to proceed at a reasonable pace. Sure, it's over-the-top (I'm pretty sure motorbikes can't drive up buildings), but it's inspired by comic books, so I guess that's the point. Unfortunately, it's all downhill from there as it tries to inject itself with a dose of seriousness in the form of issues such as the threat of disease pandemics while trying to remain an exciting action film: the same characters that discuss peace and unity also come out with clich\u00e9d one-liners such as \"You got blood on me\" and \"Is that all you got?\". The action sequences are linked by unnecessary shots of CGI scenery and loose references to something that may be a plot, creating the impression that entire sections of this film have been left on the cutting-room floor, and because of its sense of self-importance it quickly gets tedious despite its relatively short running time (80-ish minutes). The animation style (comic book inspired, lots of bright, annoying colours) gets boring quickly and the acting is poor, although in fairness it isn't really helped by the weak dialogue or the premise of the film as a whole.In short, this is a woeful film partially redeemed only by the fact that the lead actress is a supermodel.

First it has one of the sexiest and most beautiful leading lady's on phenomenal display. Guys ( and gals) if you like maxed out eye candy, this movie needs to be near top of your list. Speaking of eye candy, the super-stylized action is truly a joy and even a marvel to behold. Is every single shot award-worthy? No. In fact some scenes or shots are very cringe-worthy. This movie strangely represents both extremes of the quality spectrum. Some are C-movie level. Some are among the most beautiful and enjoyable ever. If you can be totally objective, and just let each scene be what it is, there is a LOT to enjoy in this movie. I own the DVD, and love putting it on about 3 to 6 times a year. It's original. You have to respect and appreciate that. It also took a lot of risks in its its originality. Big balls should get big appreciation. Especially when the end result is overall very enjoyable. Will you roll your eyes occasionally? Sure. But dont throw this one out because of that. Just know what your getting into beforehand, and everything will be fine. In fact it's going to be a lot better than fine. One of my favorite action sci fi movies of all time. A hell of an enjoyable movie if you let it be. I recommend watching more than once.

It's nothing new, but it moves quickly, and there are great action scenes ahead.Kurt Wimmer, Mike Smith and Hiro Koda choreographed some very unique action scenes that feature Milla Jovovich doing what Christian Bale did in EQUILIBRIUM just as well, and employing a lot of mele\u00e9 weapons work and dodging her enemies attacks so that they kill each other instead.

Kate's moves are full of dark meaning, Charlize can make you cry for joy, but Milla has something going on that only a guy will understand. Not that he'll be able to explain it. There's something about the way Milla can evoke a sort of daring that defies her being outranked. She could die tomorrow and somehow she would live on in my mind as someone who is fiercely independent and so defiantly beautiful that I actually ache thinking about it.Here she is once again being handled by a director who is as enthralled by her as us male audience members. On more than one level, this movie could use improving; it ultimately needs a better storyline, for example. But what it does do well is showcase Milla. And that's all it really has to do to be worth the price of admission. For the most part, we're treated to long, loving shots of her, though I must warn you, when she is asked to take off her clothes early on in the movie, the director betrays his sex by shooting her from a great distance and in the shadows. Still, with the possible exception of the Fifth Element's director, Luc Besson, I'd say this director, Kurt Wimmer, is probably the most successful at capturing her in all her maddeningly unfathomable glory. So what if the screenplay needs work? Anyone would have a hard time trying to find some way to fully accommodate Milla.",

A PARK!Bad Acting: i don't even want to comment here... none of the actors are excused.Dialogue: Violet and the kid were on a first letter basis just minutes after meeting.

A random collection of actions. in a nutshell: Violet recovers some kind of weapon that puts all her people at risk. she discovers that it is a human child. she then devotes her life to protecting this child. which is a good plan, apart from the kid being an intolerable little brat, because she takes out 6 or more people at once with no problem. which is OK at the beginning of the movie, but throughout the plot (random collection of actions) she never meets a real challenge in a fight. oh yeah, don't forget a failed attempt at adding a love interest and a sense of maternal responsibility, neither of which make sense in the last 10 minutes of movie, and only robs you of brain cells to accompany the money you paid to see it.

Lemme give ya a crash course on art: Art can either have a message for the recipient to ponder over time, or it can be a bundle of kick-ass entertainment for the recipient to enjoy now. A movie is a dual medium: it has a narrative expression, and it has a visual expression. A lot of people have got it into their heads that only the narrative expression - the story - matters. This is not true. Some movies (Catwoman, for another!) excel in visual style, and that is the whole point. Sure, I agree that it's a sad trend that more and more movies are like this, but in the cases where it's done really beautifully, I think it should be appreciated for the art that it can be. I am a comic book reader, and although this movie was not in fact based on a comic, it does indeed try its very best to be like one. Visually, I thoroughly enjoyed Ultraviolet; despite the forgettable story it had lots and lots of amazingly gorgeous scenes, and I had the instant urge to see it again.

That renewed a bit my lost faith in mankind (For a while, at least)That being said, this film was pretty dire anyway: And not even Ed Wood style so-over-the-top-bad-it's-hilarious bad, but just downright dreary and forgettable. Coupled with the movie's lame acting, lame CGI, lame story, and nose plug villain was a misguided marketing campaign, as this has nothing whatsoever to do with vampires and honestly I'd get further into this since I really can't remember much about the sad excuse for a plot that \"Ultraviolet\" was. Personally, I consider it to be not only the worst Milla Jovovich film (And that's saying something) but also one of the worst (And dumbest) movies ever made. Seriously, it was even worse than the \"Resident Evil\" films\u0085.How is that possible?Fortunately this drivel didn't became a franchise of films. It would have been something horrible.",

            "content": "In the late 21st Century, a war between humans and genetically modified \"Hemophages\" who have enhanced speed and stamina, gets a new player as an infected woman named Violet (Milla Jovovich) finds herself having to protect a 9-year-old boy (Cameron Bright) who is considered a threat to the human population.Ultraviolet is an awful movie that fails on nearly every level. It suffers from horrible acting, weak direction and lame writing. The film did have some potential to succeed but it didn't work out too well. The premise was pretty far-fetched yet still interesting. Unfortunately, they did a really bad job with it. The characters were all laughable and poorly developed. The dialog was terrible and unconvincing. Also, the film took itself too seriously and there was no real fun to be had. For the entire movie, it just kept a serious and dull tone. The story wasn't confusing just very silly. It would have been fine if the film had a sense of humor but it was just too serious. I'm guessing it wanted to be taken seriously but it went over the top in that sense.The acting was horrific and nobody gave a good performance. Milla Jovovich just fell flat as Violet. She was wooden and very dull. Sure, her appearance may fit the role but her performance was still pretty bad. Cameron Bright kept the same expression on his face throughout the entire film. He was completely unconvincing and bland. After seeing him in Birth, I thought he had some potential to be a good actor but I guess not. Nick Chinlund was just bad as the villain. William Fichtner gave the best performance but that's not an achievement.I have never seen Equilibrium and I'm not sure if I want to see it. After watching this film, I don't think Kurt Wimmer has a lot of talent. He moved the film at a decent pace but he never generated any thrills or excitement. The fight scenes were so bland and lame. Also, it was the same type of fighting throughout the entire film and it got repetitive really fast. The film was very stylish though and he should be given credit for that. However once you get by the decent eye candy, there isn't much to be found here. It lacked in everything else and it ended up being a complete bore. In the end, Ultraviolet isn't worth watching.

            "content": "The touching climax to Ultraviolet has Mila Jojojojojojojojojovich, an actress of many talents, though few acting related, kneeling over the body of cloned boy-child six. We thought he was dead but this was, aside from wishful thinking, just one lattice of audience misdirecting pastry in Kurt Wimmer's action adventure pie. The boy awakes, revitalised by vampire Mila's antibody infused tears. Eyes open, the scene is pregnant with soft strings and emotional intensity \u0096 he looks into her spray painted face and contorted with confusion softly says \"Violet, I don't understand \u0096 I thought I was dead\". Er, pardon? You thought you were DEAD? How exactly? In the clone afterlife? But this, believe it or not is the perfect rounding off for a truly absurd portion of Eurotrash. Wimmer may not have a rich command of the English language but that's okay, he isn't really on top of his game in any department. His garish, braindead actioner is that rare thing \u0096 a poor adaptation of an imaginary comic book. We've seen the real thing murdered for years but Wimmer can't even put his own idea on the screen \u0096 indeed his head may have been the best place for it. It's the old story about a war between the 'hymophages' (vampires) and us humans. Mila is one such vampire who steals a guitar case that contains a small boy (Bare with me) \u0096 the boy may or may not be a bio-weapon engineered by evil Dexus, the head of, what else, a evil corporation who is trying to wipe out the blood infected menace. The plot, and it certainly is a plot of some kind, is a gamely excuse for Kick Ass Kurt to recycle his favourite scenes from the Matrix and to be fair to him, perhaps in the knowledge that the screenplay isn't his strongest card, they're suitably over the top. Not graceful you understand or even well directed \u0096 the machine gun edits make your eyes hurt as do the shaky close-ups, but this is the only thing keeping you going so you're grateful that Mila kills a room full of men roughly once every 3 minutes. When she isn't killing escalating numbers of disposable manpower we're in trouble with the story creaking though its p*ss-poor paces.As subtle as a fist through the sphincter, Ultraviolet wants to be the Matrix with Vampirism but some interesting production design aside, the poverty of imagination and invention added to the truly hideous computer effects make this one as animated as Keanu Reeves' face. Exposure to Ultraviolet rays can give you cancer \u0096 a tantalising prospect after 90 minutes of this. Don't \u0096 not even for an 'ironic' day in the cinema. If you're considering it you're not that sophisticated believe me.",

I liked all the action, all the suspense, and most of all, Milla Jovovich! Changing the hair and attire color was a amazing thing to see. That outfit was really crazy when Violet(Milla Jovovich) absorbed the blood into her costume. And with a body like Jovovich you just couldn't compare. The weapons she used; the guns with secret loaders, the Bladed Uzi, and the super sword, would definitely make Blade jealous. And the sword fights are phenomenal.

Because everything you do or see after this movie, will be ray of sunshine in your life! So, let's assume you're out for a picnic, it's a beautiful day, you are eating a sandwich from your picnic basket. Then, all of a sudden a large bird flys over and craps directly in your sandwich. You then proceed to unwittingly eat the sandwich without realizing. No need to worry,\u0085. its not bad as sitting through Ultraviolet. Now, let's assume you're walking down the street and you slip on a dog turd, fall down some stairs and land head first in a bucket of acid some child left on the sidewalk, followed shortly by your body being eaten by radioactive, plague rats. No problem, at least you'll never have to see this god damn move again!So why is this movie so bad, I really don't know where to start. First off, the CGI is terrible; the superimposition of the motorbike in the chase scene is horrific and could have been rivalled in MS Paint. The dialogue is beyond awful; there are no words in the English language that do justice to the bad acting and terrible dialogue in this movie. And if there are, I certainly can't use them on IMDb.By far and wide, the worst part of the movie is a scene where Violet sends a hologram to the \"enemy base\", the hologram pulls up in a car, and is faced down by many rows of (probably CGI) enemies. Some bad dialogue later, the car and hologram are toast \u0096 pan to real Violet and the child she is protecting. Child says \"There's too may of them, there's just too many\"\u0085 Then, INSTANTLY, pan to vision-like scene of child and Violet playing in the park\u0085 child dies. What the hell??!?!?!?!?!?!??! At this point, I felt my arm moving of it's own free will \u0096 yes, it wanted to punch me in the face for watching this god forsaken film!I like many others here have been compelled to sign up to IMDb just to warn other people of this movie. If you are waiting for the director's cut\u0085 you'll be waiting a while I fear, as I'm pretty sure this movie was so bad, it's just not worth taking the risk of releasing another potential failure.I consider myself to be an easy movie-goer, I don't ask a lot from movies. I've seen movies that have gotten 3-4 on IMDb and thoroughly enjoyed them. But Ultraviolet takes the cake. (It takes it, eats it and then spits it in your face, then laughs at you for paying for the cake!). I always thought Derailed (the Van-Damne one) was the worst film I ever saw (followed closely by AI),.. but yes, we have a new loser!

            "content": "Ultraviolet is a much needed action movie for a couple of reasons: 1) The action is insane. You point out another movie that has at least an iota of adrenalin infused action mayhem like this movie does, and I will eat my own mouse pad and seek this alleged movie out. Seriously, the action scenes have set a standard: kick ... MY... A$$! Milla has outshone her competitors in the arena of B.W.C.K.M.A ( babes who can kick my a$$) When she growls that she's pi$$ed, you know it as she has the action chops to back it all up. 2) This movie had a couple of moments which caught me off guard. I was surprised at how touched I was in some areas as Violet opens up to the boy she's protecting, Daxus. It was just the last thing I expected to see, and the movie has a strong heart, it's just built on a shaky foundation, but more on that later. What I appreciate is the director's approach to infuse his story with genuine emotion, no matter how hokey it may seem. That alone will be the bane for many viewers of this film, I can tell you that right now. But I enjoyed his earnest approach. 3)The movie's gadgets. Two words: freaking' .... COOL! When Violet uses a disposable phone, I giggled as ... I WANTED ONE! As well, her weapons were great too, I just really appreciated the fact that a lot of thought went into her arsenal and her world in providing little quirks of innovation. Those three elements pretty much guarantees a DVD purchase for me alone. But with the good, comes the bad. My biggest gripe comes from the maternal switch Violet abruptly fumbles into. The movie's running time is really short, so the transition of Violet going from professional injury dispenser, to over protective mommy is a bit pretentious. A little bit more development on that front would have served the movie miles in believability. My other complaint is the on/off again direction of the script, as in some of the moments in the movie shone, while others were dealt with... less attention. The director applied double pressure on himself by taking on the all consuming director's chair, and by writing the script. I love the way Kurt directs: he has vision up the whoso with camera shots of crystal clarity, so yeah his directing is what pays the bills. What I'm not so hot on is the writing, and consequently, iffy writing translates into iffy acting. Some of the lines Milla delivers in the movie will elicit scoffs and giggles for the dead pan delivery. But ultimately, this movie sits comfortably as there is nothing visually like it. This movie could have been revolutionary, but action for me alone will never cut it. If the story had been ironed out and properly formatted, this movie would have transcended the video game-inspired trappings it finds itself in, but as it stands, it remains with a disappointing story overall, but with action you have to see to believe. But do me a favor: I write here to obviously offer up my opinion, but if you are reading this or any other review, remember to come to your own conclusions. Right now, on Rotten Tomatoes, this movie is sitting at a putrid 10%, so they deemed it as a stinker. As a result, people tend to allow critics the finality of opinions, so don't be a drone, and come to your own conclusions. SEE THE MOVIE, AND JUDGE FOR YOURSELF!!!",

Not only is Jovovich possibly the most talented supermodel turned actress currently, she was so convincing as violet that you would wish this was a telly series. But too bad it isn't, and too bad the writers decided to take a nap instead of giving us much of a plot. The story is as simple as this: Violet was a normal human being living light years into the future, a future without any disease. One day, her husband dies from a rare vampire-like disease that managed to survive the sterilization era and when the government gets to know that violet is pregnant, they quarantine her and in the process murder the child she is pregnant with. They they force her to live amongst the small group of closely studied surviving individuals who are carriers of the disease. One day, Violet (now a member of an underground resistance group) breeches security and intercepts a top secret package. She is told by her superiors not to open the package, and to destroy it if her mission becomes compromised, but Violet, ever the rebel has her own ideas. While transporting the package, she opens it and discovers that there is a child inside of it. She then takes it upon herself rescue the child and fight all those who would jeopardize her newly assumed personal mission. As long as you can get over the fact that the film looks like an overblown Loreal Advertisement, you'll be fine because Milla (looking very much like Selma Blair on something very strong) kicks some major butt, and looks good doing it too.",

After the initial outbreak the human population named the infected Hemophages & have rounded them up into concentration camps, this prejudice continued until it was decided to wipe the Hemophages out completely, small groups of Hemohages still exist & fight for survival including assassin warrior Violet (Mila Jovovich) who is sent on a mission to steal a secret weapon developed by corporate madman Daxus (Nick Chinlund) that is said to have the capability of wiping all Hemophages out. With this secret weapon in her grasp Violet is hunted by Daxus & his men& they don't intend to take prisoners...Available in both a PG & longer Unrated cut this colourful futuristic action film was written & directed by Kurt Wimmer I have to admit that I actually quite liked Ultraviolet, sure there's the typical IMDb comments that claim it's the 'worst film ever' which every single film ever made has (they can't all be the worst film ever, right?) but if you approach it in the right way then Ultraviolet is a lot fun & the first half certainly provides plenty of action & style for your money. The plot & film itself feels like a graphic novel or comic book adaptation & is perhaps moist similar to Blade (1998) with it's Vampires vs humans battle with a sole Vampire caught between the two factions, the actual story about Violet & a young boy on the run is alright if not exactly brilliant & the happy ending sucks but to be honest the plot is little more than a device to hang various action set-piece scenes one after the other. As far as action films go I doubt you will find one more packed with shoot-outs, fights, explosions, car & bike chases & general mayhem than Ultraviolet. The first half in particular is none stop action & once the film settles down it becomes slightly dull by comparison. The action scenes have a certain amount of imagination & flair too, the plot isn't great, it's a bit predictable & there's nothing deep or meaningful here but if you just want stylish good looks & great action scenes then Ultraviolet is worth a watch.Another huge influence on Ultraviolet is The Matrix (1999) with it's cool poses & visually great action scenes, The Matix had bullet time while here we have Gun Kata which is some nonsense about being able to predict the trajectory of bullets or something. Anyway the action scenes her are cool with an anti-gravity device which lets Violet ride the side of a building on a motorbike, lots of slow motion fights, plenty of shoot-outs & it's all filmed with an amazing visual style where the camera moves all over the place & everyone & everything just looks cool & stylish. I also thought Violet herself looked great in that tight fitting outfit & shades, it's sort of cool how her outfit changes colour depending on her mood. None of the fights have any blood even in the Unrated version. There's loads of CGI here, some of it looks a bit cartoon like but it's pretty good for the majority of the time.With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 this had a decent enough budget & most of it ended up on screen as the visuals are spectacular at times although unfortunately the same cannot be said about the story. Apparently shot in China. The acting isn't great, Jovovich looks great but other than that is forgettable as is everyone else to be honest.Ultraviolet is a film which has a bad reputation it seems which is a puzzle to me as I think it's great action packed fun with a terrific sense of style, it's just a shame the story is weak & some of the acting is poor especially during the emotional bits towards the end.",

            "content": "The above summary actually sounds better, as an idea in and of itself, than the resulting movie. After Kurt Wimmer's surprisingly entertaining and under looked Equilibrium (starring pre-Batman Christan Bale), I had high expectations for his third movie. I had seen this movie in it's theatrical debut. I remember leaving the theater, however, confused and bewildered. I figured the second time around would yield a better indicator of the actual worth of the movie.Kurt Wimmer made a movie based on a non-existing comic book. The convoluted story is about a pathophobic authoritarian dystopia, where a super soldier virus evolves into a plague and leads to forced relocations and ultimately genocide. Two factions are born; the healthy (medial totalitarian state) and the infected (terrorist rebel underground - a.k.a. hemophages, a.k.a. \"blood-eaters\", a.k.a. vampires). Symptoms of the infection include stronger bones, better hearing and eyesight, faster healing and hyper-fast reflexes. The only drawback is the dozen year life span.In all honesty, I like the first half of this movie. The first 5 minutes is an action movie delight, complete with an air bomb/bowling ball ninja death squad. The narrative voice-over, that follows, is when the dread begins. This is mostly due to the realization that this is a puree of preexisting ideas. Equilibrium (also a puree) worked because it didn't try too hard. It didn't fall into the computer graphics trap. It presented a world that was slightly askew, yet eerily possible. All those things that worked in Equilibrium have been tweaked here to the nth degree and subsequently combines into a Frankenstein movie. Unfortunately, it just looks, feels and acts too much like an Aeon Flux clone. Do we really need two?The movie is a hell of a nonsensical but visually stimulating ride, until about 1/2 way through. This is about the time when our infected and meta-skilled heroine, Violet (Milla Jovovich), ends up on the fence between her people and the organization she is sworn to defend because her maternal instincts kick in. A highly skilled assassin turns into a highly skilled assassin-soccer mom. Milla Jovovich has a certain knack for picking outrages roles and generally excels in things requiring little acting ability. She does look exceptional in a tight body suit. Some of the technology has a nice wow-factor (gravity leveler and transportable space, to name a couple), but is simply there for show.The second half of the movie is her trying to act in the middle of a nonsensical, non-stop action scenario. It becomes a case of \"are we done yet?\". It is just too much and too repetitious to deal with. Nothing new is added to the mix after this point, so it becomes a case of rinse & repeat. As in his previous movie, colors are primary and important. I guess Wimmer forgot to add the visual context, because all the color changes just seem to be part of the cool factor and have little to do with the plot. There is a lot of wire work and continuation of gun-kata (from Equilibrium). The problem is we are made to believe that a nurse and wife became an uber, meta-human assassin through a metabolic change and not training. Is Wimmer choosing nature over nurture or is he just so intoxicated off the smell of his own genius that he didn't even consider what he was creating?For Wimmer this is his Modern Prometheus. It is the monster he created with his own hands, that is currently proving to be his outdoing. On my \"shot scale\" this is a 5 drink minimum. The top half is good, with the bottom half being synonymous to diving head-first into an empty swimming pool. Save the last 3 shots for the second half of the movie, as you will be bored to tears otherwise. Here's a toast to Wimmer. May his next movie not suck! Zum Wohl!-Celluloid Rehab",

            "content": "WHAT WENT WRONG?!!!!! That's the nagging thought that will not leave throughout this film.After all, this movie was made by the people who made Equilibrium which didn't score high on all fronts but delivered a great package at a lower budget.Also the fighting style pioneered by that movie was brilliant and to think what he could have done with it in this movie considering now we have a hot chick with superpowers was tantalizing.The pedigree of the maker of this film is evident from the concepts in this film:- 1)For the first time that I can remember humans are the bad guys and it's the bad guys were routing for (vampires), WHAT A CONCEPT.2)The one liners of this film are as simple..... and cutting edge as they get (a couple of them were overdone though), when the DYING CHILD SPEAKS SO UNEMOTIONALLY ABOUT HIS IMPEDING DEATH I HAD GOOSE BUMPS.3)The storyline had some major potential the star-warsque method of using names and words and offering no explaining teased the mind.4)The multiple parties with different political and ideological viewpoints was of the level of a A-grade film.5)Like I said before watching people fight with with both swords and modern guns in a modern setting is shear poetry, the entire concept of Gun Kata developed by Kurt is sheer visual poetry.6)The \"speak, hear and say no evil scene\", sheer brilliance, the fights towards the end of the movie..... mind blowing.7)Milla Jovovich may not have repeated her performance from Resident Evil but she looked stunning in parts she carried the role with a level of panache that I never though a woman of her beauty could.The rest of the cast to acted in brilliantly and even though this is a lower budget action film no one really overacted. Cameron Bright as 6 and William Fitchner as Garth were brilliant.SO WHAT THE HELL WENT WRONG???!!..........Here are a few prime candidates..1)I am a an action and B-Movie fan and normally I feast on lower grade special effects and cheesy dialogues but this movie HAD POSSIBLY THE WORST SPECIAL EFFECTS I HAVE SEEN IN EVEN A LOWER BUDGET FILM IN A LONG TIME, the film makers may have air brushed the entire film purposefully but the helicopter chase scene and ALMOST EVERYT OTHER BIG ACTION SCENE even though they were brilliantly conceptualised,were ruined due to the pathetic special effects. I mean any sensible film maker knows there is a budget and he has to work around it. (FOR ME THE BIGGEST Villain)2)Kurt sure doesn't learn from his mistakes, equilibrium fell short mainly due to its boring and uninspiring villain and here we have a villain who is not only all that but also overacts.To add to that we have him breaking into monologues trying to explain the entire storyline of the movie.3)While Milla looked stunning in some scenes she looked positively hideous in others, we are constantly showed her rear and toned abs and even showed her bare rear (haha), her violet hair works for a while but after a while becomes overbearing.4)THE RATINGS.................AGAIN For some weird reason its OK to kill a few hundred people and murder and rape a person as long as you don't show blood and its OK to show the naked ass but anything else is a no-no.Only the warped people on the rating board can explain the mundane rating parameters.And once again the film-makers (IN THIS CASE I SUSPECT THE STUDIO BECAUSE YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THE BLOODSHED WAS SHOT BUT WAS BADLY EDITED OUT), fall victim to the lure of universal and we have another PG-13 rated action movie on out hands. (NO 2 CULPPRIT).So yet again we have a movie with had some great potential but failed considering the pedigree that cast, plot and directer had I would like to put it up there with Underworld Evolution and AVP in wasted potential.Would not recommend you rent this movie but you can borrow it or watch it on TV IF YOU ARE REALLY BORED.-s PG-13 rating, boring villain, super cheesy special effects, wasted potential +/-s no explanation given to a lot of concepts +s super conceptualisation of shots and scenes, pedigree displayed in some scenes, bad guys are the good guys etc.total 4/10 (absolute and factoring in expectations).",

            "content": "It seems that Ultraviolet really doesn't have too good of a reputation. I really can't get behind the negativity though as I found this to be a perfectly entertaining bit of sci-fi action. It's certainly a case of style over substance but again that's okay. The writing isn't great to be fair but the movie is more or less relentless in its action and spectacle. The reason that it ultimately gets away with this, is because Milla Jovovich looks and acts the part; and she is in practically every scene. Like many female fronted superhero movies, it gets a bad rap and I often wonder if there is at least a little bit of sexism to blame for that. But whatever the case, I usually find these types of movies far better than their reputation suggests they will be. Having a kick-ass, statuesque girl fronting a superhero flick makes them automatically more interesting as far as I am concerned.Ultraviolet, like Sam Raimi's Darkman, is one of those occasional movies that follows the conventions of a comic-book adaption without actually being based on a comic at all. The credit sequence shows various fake comics to give the impression that it is, while the storyline, title and heroine certainly seem like they have come from the pages of one. We have a dystopian future world, an immoral figure ruling over the masses, an army of robotic black-clad minions defending him, a group of rebels hopelessly outnumbered and...vampires. The latter plot element is one that could have been developed more but it is certainly quite distinctive. The action scenes are protracted, over-the-top, wilfully unrealistic and fun. The overall look is perhaps a little too fake at times, with lots of CGI and visual effects that make everything look slightly more comic-book. But, at least it has a consistency of look and feel and even if it is a little excessive, sometimes excess can be okay. It's certainly nowhere near as bad as is often made out to be. If you go into this one with the right attitude, you should really have a bit of fun.",

            "content": "I've read reviews that blast Wimmer for this film. And as a film critic, I would have to agree that this is not your average action /fantasy/adventure film. It is an entirely different genre that will probably find it's niche in the same fashion the old Saturday morning serials at the movies did. This is a COMIC BOOK for the screen, like Nemesis (next review), and should be viewed like one. There is little lead in, except for about ten minutes of narration by Jovovich to set the stage. The action scenes are fast and final, and nobody gets out alive, except our heroine. The characters are polarized, no doubt about good guys or bad guys, and the scenery is futuristic and simple. If you are looking for science fiction with the depth of Star Trek or Star Wars, forget this movie. But if you want to watch one of the hottest women on the planet kick ass and take names without the entanglement of complex plots or deep emotional meaning, here's your film. Milla Jovovich is the perfect choice for the film, Nick Chinlund does what he does best, gives us a character we can despise, and William Fichtner rises to the occasion in a role that does little to show his real abilities. Cameron Bright is the perfect CLK (Creepy Little Kid), as one critic described him. Oh, and despite the opening credits where they show you comic book cover after cover in several languages, Ultraviolet was never a comic book in print. Perhaps I am belaboring the obvious here, but for the benefit of those critics who have blasted this film, the comic books at the beginning tell you the film itself is a COMIC BOOK. Or would you prefer the term Graphic Novel? You guys get it now? As far as the kiddies, parents should look this over first, but it wasn't terribly offensive in language or nudity, and the violence is over so quickly it may or may not make a bad impression.",

            "content": "I'm a basic theatre regular, I go a couple times a week just for the sheer fun of seeing whatever is released good or bad, whatever is playing. Over the years I've developed the ability to find a least one good thing about the majority of bad films I see just to feel like I haven't completely wasted my $10.95. I invited to see a free midnight screening of UltraViolet, which, judging from the trailer just seemed like slightly different version of Aeon Flux. I'm trying very hard to come up with one positive thing about Ultraviolet, but I can't even come close. Ultraviolet is so frustratingly awful to watch, I had to walk out an hour through the film because it was giving me a headache.Calling it the worst film ever made is a bit of a stretch, I understand, but Ultraviolet is truly worthy of the title. Every member of the cast was terrible, the dialogue sounded like it was written by a preteen fanfiction writer and the CGI was just plain unimpressive and did not blend in well with the rest of the film.It is very difficult to give a summary of the film's plot, because it was virtually nonexistent. I could not understand what was going on 90% of the time. Many characters, elements and backstories were introduced but never explained or explored further making them pointless to what was going on. It story basically travelled from plothole to plothole, the most annoying of which was a scene were Violent was running from the government with 6, a young weapon of sorts Violet, being the cold merciless killer that she was, decided to save for an unexplained reason. Endless numbers of guards are chasing them through a skyscraper, then outside, then suddenly they're back in the skyscraper, then they're outside again, then they're back in the building and in a subway. It was just confusing! Were they outside on ground level or inside a skyscraper? Never bothered to explain.Another scene in which Violet was cornered in every direction, she gets a hologram phone call in which see says she would meet Nerva in 10 minutes and seconds later she is unharmed at such a meeting point, Kurt Wimmer (writer) simply forgot to finish writing a chase sequence. Were did all those guards pursuing her go? How could she possibly of escaped when she knew she was cornered? Through the first half of the film Violet referred to her kind as hemophages, and in the second half as vampires. It did show infected victims of the hemophage disease had fangs, but how were they vampires? Where did that title even come in? Not one character portrayed any of the trademark vampire characteristics. Maybe hardcore fans of the Ultraviolet comic book would understand this reference, but what of the rest of the audience? Direction was the worst of it all. Even though I said the actors were terrible, given the source material and their schmuck of a director, I doubt any of today's finest actors could have salvaged anything out of this nightmare. The camera work was particularly agonizing and dull, as it seemed every 'tense' moment the world had to freeze and the camera had to jump to everyone's eyes, guns, outfit several times before the film would get moving again. I believe it was a ploy to try and lengthen the 97min running time.The action sequences aren't anything to behold, pretty pathetic seeing as how Ultraviolet is nothing but. Every action scene is the exactly the same as the one on 2 minutes prior (literally), turning even some of the most over the top moments into an utter bore.Maybe by some freak chance the film redeemed itself in the last 20 minutes after I walked out, I wouldn't know. I can only beg people not to see this movie and allow it to crash and burn like only the most horrid trash deserves. One can only hope it bombs during opening weekend, cautioning Hollywood to stop making this type of garbage.If you must see a piece of eye candy jumping around shooting armies of people and having things explode every 5 minutes, go see Aeon Flux. It may not be good, but it at least tries, which is more then I can say for Ultraviolet. 0/10",

Ultraviolet is quite unique and original to watch but overall the film doesn't offer much in terms of plot.Stylish and visually creative to look at, one of the redeeming factors is the look and presence of Milla Jovovich. Sporting slim and tight attires, and different sorts of wig's, she has the proper look in a CGI filled film as this. Ultraviolet as a film is disappointing compared to director Kurt Wimmer's previous film Equilibrium, as one can tell the similarities between the two. However, that film had a better meaning, comic relief, overall plot, was more suspenseful, and was more entertaining and interesting throughout. Although Ultraviolet is quite forgettable, it's simply a mindless action film. Don't expect too much.",

Most of the fight choreography is uninspired, slow, and just plain unexciting. The fights are hackneyed, the acting from basically the entire cast (including the normally decent Fichtner and Bright) feels phoned-in, and the plot is full of holes and eyebrow-raisers.A real disappointment.",

Jovovich does a reasonably good job in her typical woman-slayer role, Cameron Bright excels in his typical creepy-child role, and William Ficthner is still engaging in his typical neurotic gadget-guy role. The fights are much less cluttered than those of Equilibrim, and each one is pure eye-candy, especially the fire-filled finale in which Jovovich dukes it out with Daxus (Nick Chinlund, looking utterly ridiculous with tea strainers affixed to his nose. My main complaint here is the CGI. It is incredibly awful and looks like one of the first 3-d video games. Other little nitpicks include a few minor plot holes, and a character's rebirth for which no explanation would be fitting, especially the one provided. Who knows.

Now, here's why I am confused by this film: the director Kurt Wimmer last directed film, EQUILIBRIUM, really worked for me - that included Christian Bale's acting, the production design, the costumes, the fighting, the editing. For ULTRAVIOLET, these are the elements that were missing unfortunately. I couldn't buy Mila Jovovich as a hardened superhuman assassin who couldn't be defeated and barely hurt (for example, her voice is too soft and not forceful enough for an assassin type character), the costume and production design seemed to be over the top, to the point that it became corny and/or unoriginal. The music again was just as generic. And worst of all, the story was nonexistent or jumbled, the dialogue was uninspiring, and the characters were one-sided.

But to my surprise,I liked \"Ultraviolet\" a lot...but I feel hard pressed to justify it. \"Aeon Flux\", a very similar future-dystopia/martial arts movie in a similar vein, left me cold, and I like Charlize Theron better then Milla Jovovich, so what's my deal here? Yes, the story line is pretty sketchy. Yes, it's kind of silly watching \"V\" get all choked up about the fate of one child when she blithely kills dozens (or hundreds) of people in the course of the movie. And the movie doesn't explain its back story nearly well enough. And yes, the CGI is a little sketchy in spots. And yes, Jovovich's delivery is pretty laughable in some of the key scenes. I don't care. I like \"Ultraviolet\" anyway. Partly I think it's because I like the way Wimmer directs action scenes (I saw elements of the \"Gun Kata\" from Wimmer's previous film in many sequences). Some of it is that I think the film just plain looks cool; the characters wear their futuristic costumes well, every one looks great and polished and streamlined and M.J. was born to wear futuristic spandex that shows off her navel. Some of it is because I really liked some of the supporting performances, especially the actor who played \"Daxus\" (who is in some ways the most interesting LOOKING actor in the movie - his countenance dances with humor and malice simultaneously), the kid playing the enigmatic \"Six\" (the camera seems to love him and he really does bring something to the role) and the guy who plays \"Garth\" (even with ridiculous vampire fangs). So I can see why some people might have had problems with this movie, but I liked it for the same reasons I liked \"Equlibrium\" - there was just enough right with it to let me overlook the obvious clich\u00e9s and weaknesses. I may pick it up for my DVD collection if I can find a good, cheap used copy somewhere, which is a close as I come to a \"seal of approval\".",

            "content": "It continually astounds me that Hollywood movie studios can crank out trash like this over and over again and not learn their lesson. Didn't Aeon Flux teach us anything? Ultraviolet, despite being jam packed with more action scenes than you can shake a holographic sword at, is one of the most boring spectacles ever put on celluloid. I had to take several breaks during the course of the movie so as not to fall asleep.The movie opens with a line from Violet (Milla Jovovich). \"I was born into a world you may not understand.\" Violet lives in a futuristic world full of horribly rendered and poorly constructed CGI skyscrapers, where there is a thinly veiled underground war going on between vampires and humans. These vampires are actually human, but have been transformed through a virus. The humans want to destroy the vampires to supposedly quell the threat of the virus, but the vampires don't want to be destroyed. Violet, of course, is one of these vampires, who, of course, have super-speed, super-intelligence, super strength, and, in the case of Violet, super-tight spandex pants. The virus is supposedly highly contagious, yet all the citizens of the city wear are masks that barely cover their mouths, and even then these masks only appear in scenes here and there. Another problem with this supposed \"war\" is that we never really see any difference at all between a vampire and a human - they are virtually exactly alike. Oh wait, now I see the difference. They have rather pointy canine teeth. Of course, how silly of me. That's a perfectly good reason all humans want to kill all vampires. Sigh......we are never really given a reason for this war between vampires and humans to exist - it is just a thinly veiled excuse for Violet to show off her Kung Fu skills.Here is another problem with the film. Violet's fighting is so perfect, so flawless, and so over-the-top that all tension completely vanishes from the entire movie. The question is never \"Will Violet get out of this mess?\", but it is rather \"Holy crap another action scene - can we please move on?\" Aside from this, each action scene is an exact duplicate of the previous one. Violet wanders into a circular room, around which stand an absurd amount of guards. The guards rush forward in a chaotically inept matter. Then Violet, in two-three minutes of indistinct loud gun banging sounds, debris flying unimpressively around the room, and the tired and oh-so-overused sound of her sword stabbing someone, kills everybody. Then she rushes off the scene as if she's going to be late to the next circular ambush of bad guys.Anyways, back to the story. Violet infiltrates a large vault type thing. When the guards discover she is an impostor, one guard yells to his superior, \"She probably blah-blah-blahed this and blah-blah-blahed that to get past our security measures!\" At that point I thought to myself, \"Then why wouldn't there be a security measure against THAT?\" Plot holes abound in this movie like holes abound in swiss cheese. Kurt Wimmer (the director) doesn't care if something doesn't make sense - he just cares that the action looks good.Unfortunately, he even fails at that. One of the action scenes involves Violet running up the side of a building on a motorcycle, across the top, then off into the air at a hovering helicopter. This is a scene that should be steeped in tension, yet I couldn't take my eyes off of the horrible CGI. It looked like it belonged in an XBOX 360 game. Now, I admit, Wimmer was probably going for a stylized look, but even considering that, there are so many sloppy camera cuts, and such horrible background to foreground contrast of lighting that I found myself blinking more times than I probably should have been.The movie goes on to have Violet find a child who supposedly contains a cure for the vampire virus. She proceeds to \"bond\" with him, if it can even be called that. The chemistry is completely lacking between the two; supposedly Milla Jovovich wanted to play Violet as a tough, strong willed woman, but all she comes off as is an angry teenage girl. The problem with her is not simply that she is a one-note character. It is that she is a one note character trying to be a multi-layered one, yet failing at it miserably. Each line spoken by every character in this film, especially Violet, made me sit back and gasp in astonishment, wondering if possibly a monkey could have gotten hold of the script - it certainly would have made it a better film.The overall problem with Ultraviolet is that it believes it is cool. A film like this may have worked if it were aware of its stupidity, and had played it up for the sake of the camera - a self-parody, if you will. Yet Ultraviolet's belief in its own coolness factor is precisely what destroys it as a film. It is not cool. It is supremely, absurdly, and unequivocally stupid, lacking cool in every single department there is. It has a clich\u00e9, tiredly overused plot; a one-note, uninteresting villain; a bad actress in the role of an uninteresting protagonist; acting so bad Van Damme would be proud; video game quality CGI; repetitive and boring little bursts of unimaginative action called \"fight scenes, and finally, an ending so hollow and so predictable that you realize you have just completely wasted an hour and fifty minutes of your time. The ONLY redeeming quality in Ultraviolet is its interesting visual style; coupled with a good story and some good characters, this movie may have turned out to be a surprise hit instead of the steaming pile of box-office trash that it is.",

She shines like a star in this movie but the movie's plot is so wretched that nothing can save it, not even HER. I watched the whole thing because just watching her is entertaining but I was pretty pi$$ed off with the idiot who wrote in that she should fawn over a human child she has no relation to, will die soon, and whose adult counterparts she has no qualms whatsoever about slicing and dicing in the hundreds.It simply makes no damn sense and ruins the whole movie. We had a TON of potential- this world of UltraViolet includes elements of vampires, matrix, aeon flux, etc.. this could have been a GREAT GREAT film.Instead it was ruined by an absolutely STUPID and POINTLESS attempt at a plot twist- vampiric assassin has a soft spot for a random child that any other day of the week- she would kill without mercy.Yeah that makes TONS of sense. If you love watching this actress- watch her in this and curse the IMBECILES who HOLLYCRAPPED ultraviolet. They screwed up aeon flux and bloodrayne the same exact way- take someone who is sexy because they are inhuman and superhuman and try to make them have a frail human side- dumb. lame. pointless. The exact opposite of what we came to see here on all counts. Idiocy in script writing- excellence in action heroine. To hell with whoever wrote and directed this crap.Check this gorgeous girl out in RESIDENT EVIL instead- she shines just as bright but the script is not as worthless. I hope to see more of this goddess soon and I hope someone in Hollywood realizes THEY CANT WRITE FOR CRAP and gives the writing job to someone who can actually WRITE.Because this awesome woman is being WASTED on crap plot flicks.",

            "content": "In the ever increasing sweepstakes to create lame action movies that lack even a shred of originality, Ultraviolet is the new secret weapon. Containing not even one original idea in it's entire running time and showing off it's low-budget status at every opportunity, Ultraviolet proves to be Ultra-Lame and Ultra-Lousy.There is a plot of sorts to Ultraviolet, but the film basically boils down to one long chase sequence. Violet (Milla Jovovich), a woman in the future who is a hemophage, a person infected with a rare blood disorder that resembles some traits of vampirism, such as long teeth, light sensitivity (although not a single character in the film who is a hemophage hides from the sun at all). She is also a one-woman killing machine and is sent on a mission to retrieve a secret weapon from Vice-Cardinal Daxus (Nick Chinlund), who runs the world, seemingly (Although why does he have the title Vice-Cardinal? Does he want to give himself a promotion at some point and needed room to grow?).Violet succeeds in her mission but discovers that the weapon is a boy named Six (Cameron Bright, playing close to the same role he would essay in X-Men: The Last Stand). Violet, unable to turn the boy over to her fellow hemophages, decides to go on the run, getting help from a scientist named Garth (William Fichtner).Ultraviolet has been churned from pieces of about any other science fiction or action movie of the last decade. The Matrix, Underworld, Blade, Blade Runner and various zombie movies are among the many sources it steals from and yet writer-director Kurt Wimmer manages to make none of the final product compelling. The action sequences are monotonous and average (Watch as Violet runs away from people chasing her with guns and swords then turn around and kill them. Now, watch it again five minutes later.) and you quickly catch on to this film's theme: Violet is going to kick-ass no matter the situation and everybody going up against her might as well go ahead and lie down, because she will put you there otherwise. There is no suspense, no concern for the character, no even the slightest bit of excitement. And as with so many other films since the Matrix, Ultraviolet is a martial arts fest that is snooze inducing (Is it a requirement that to be the soldier of a megalomaniacal ruler you must know martial arts?). This is action on auto-pilot, without a semblance of real energy to it.The film's plot is inane in the extreme, and the dialogue ranges from insipid to over sophisticated for what is surrounding it. The film introduces the characters and situations in a flashback sequence at the beginning, but it fails to give us any reason to care about the plight of the central character since it still manages to leave big gaps in the story. Wimmer also stages some of his scenes laughably, with at least two sequences where characters shoot or slice multiple individuals one after the other in the same fashion and they all fall like dominoes. The movie also features some outrageous leaps of logic and stupid behavior by the characters (Why would Daxus lead an attack on the hemophages himself in a building with only a few soldiers for backup? So he can show in a future scene how good of a shot he is and proves his evilness? That is what the film suggests).Ultraviolet isn't helped by the fact that almost every other aspect of the film is sub-par. The computer generated visual effects in many sequences are cheap and generic, looking as if they were lifted out of a computer game. Ultraviolet is obviously taking a page from the Star Wars prequels and Sky Captain, filming actors in front of greenscreens and adding the environments later, but unlike those films, almost none of the surrounding imagery is convincing. The acting ranges from mediocre to terrible, Klaus Badelt's techno inspired music-score quickly proves repetitive and droning and the film has such a overwhelming visual style to it, using an endless amount of filters and post-processing, as to become headache inducing after only a few scenes.Ultraviolet is a perfect example of a filmmaker lacking any good ideas of his own, stealing ones from others, mashing it all together and saying he had \"a vision.\" Apparently, Kurt Wimmer's vision is all reruns.",

Despite the awful storyline, failed script, and awful acting, this movie still kicks Aeon Flux's ass. Mostly just because Mila looks AMAZING and the film is all together a stunning cornucopia of gorgeous gorgeousness and incredible smoothness and flow. Costume work, set design, graphics and fight choreography are superb--the best I have seen since Lord of the Rings, which is really quite a feat. So, if you don't care about beauty and cornucopias of gorgeous gorgeousness, keep away from this movie.

Excellent action, and enough moments of \"Wow\" in an era saturated with these movies to make it stand out.

Her performance in Ultraviolet is amazing, from running crazy to search for Six, to fighting the 'vampires' amazed me. Of course, advanced technology played a part and its as good as the Matrix. One example is when she's dodging a whole load of bullets and she's swooping around while the enemies kill each other by mistake, and small things like when her hair and clothes instantly changes colour.The storyline is set in the future: there's an outbreak of a virus and people infected by it 'change'. Violet is one of them, and to not spoil it too much, it changed her life in a tragic way. She soon finds out when delivering a briefcase that the only way to save her is a boy known as Six. He carries the antidote to save her and everyone else. She soon ends up being hunted though by the Government and she's frantically running with the boy to find some safety. There's no silly twist in the plot, no bad acting, it's all perfect! There are twists in the plot and they will leave you shocked.So when it comes out, I recommend you watch this film. It's one of my favourites and you won't forget it. (If you have any questions then feel free to ask.)",

The way Ultraviolet is depicted on the covers is very different from Milla Jovovich in the film, and so this created a sense of cognitive dissonance right off the bat, giving the impression that the film may not be as interesting or very true to its source material. This was a bad decision, especially since Ultraviolet is NOT based on a comic book, and the artwork was commissioned especially for the movie. Why go out of your way to point out how far your movie strayed from your artistic vision?The movie then opened with this voice-over, \"I was born into a world you may not understand,\" which I think is the absolutely best way of lowering the expectations of the audience ever invented. It was as if the film-maker just straight-out said to us, \"OK, look this isn't going to make much sense, but we tried our best.\"After the voice over, there is an action sequence punctuated with CGI effects which were embarrassingly bad. Finally, a bunch of guys are killed and a team of police are sent to examine them. The head policeman then says, \"OK guys, remember, don't touch the bodies, for obvious reasons.\" He then proceeds to touch the bodies.And that was it, that was as long as I could manage to watch this movie. Possibly it got better, but I kinda doubt it. The visual effects were horrible, the action scenes were horribly affected and unnatural, and the dialogue was just silly. It was just a really, REALLY lousy movie.",

Ultra-thin plot, ultra-bogus special effects, and ultra-boring actions scenes add up to a miserable experience. I've never yawned so much during an action movie.There is no character development here. The plot is very vague and leaves us wondering many things. I don't know why I care who is a vampire and who isn't. Was there any real point to this movie other than Mila jumping around in yet another plastic outfit? I can't find any positives for this movie so I simply gave it a 1 out of 10. I can't say that I'd give it a 0 out of 10 if I had the ability because that sort of rating is reserved for movies that aren't entertaining at all.

I'm still glad i was one of the few to go to the pictures to watch it. Every time i watch that film i find something new to take away from it. One of the things that stood out in Equilibrium was the fact that there was a very strong story, excellent actors and that the action scenes built up throughout the film, each one better than the last......so why oh why did Kurt not stick to such a winning formula for Ultraviolet?As many reviewers have stated, this film is void of a decent story/plot. What we have instead is one action scene after another which do not stand out from each other due to the repetitiveness and CGI usage.Don't get me wrong, this film oozes of Kurt Wimmer and that certain style for architecture, costumes and action that left me so impressed after Equilibrium. It just seems that Kurt went OTT for this outing and wanted to do everything all in one go. The idea of Gun Kata and the style it brings to the screen is a clever trademark and one Kurt could carry on for many a film. It just seems that Ultraviolet was overkill.As some people have stated, each action scene just seemed to consist of Violet being surrounded by bad guys who she then takes out. There was no originality to the action, it was the same each time. By the last fight sequence i didn't care about what was happening....which is in part due to the story. There's no character building, no fully explained back stories and....well, you just don't care about Violet, the kid or any of it!I've read on different sites that the studio had done a usual money grab job on this and left a lot of Kurt's original material on the cutting room floor. Before watching this film i contemplated waiting for the DC to come out on DVD but i'd have had no comparison if i hadn't of watched the theatrical version. The unrated version that is to be released is only 7 minutes longer.....which i really do not think would rescue this film.....i don't think an extra 30 minutes would.I hope that on his next outing Kurt looks at going back to the basics as he did with Equilibrium rather than being disillusioned with more money for his budget.One plus point, good to see Milla Jocovich making her claim as one of the best action chicks out there.",

ULTRAVIOLET is Wimmer's follow-up, a similar movie with a similar theme: in a futuristic world plagued by a vampire virus, a sole woman rebels against her own side and ends up on the run from pretty much everybody. However, where EQUILIBRIUM excelled in what it set out to do, ULTRAVIOLET is just a big mess \u2013 a muddle of clich\u00e9s, silly ideas, and poor acting that's laughable from the very start.Milla Jovovich seems to be the actress of choice for these B-movie messes; after her 'success' in the RESIDENT EVIL trilogy, filmmakers are crying out for her to kick ass in their own movies. She's not a patch on Bale in Wimmer's previous movie; in fact, she's one of my least favourite actresses and she just doesn't seem to have a clue what acting is all about. Standing around posing and looking cool does not a good actress make! It doesn't help that there are some other terrible performances from cast members like scene-chewing villain Nick Chinlund while other, decent actors like William Fichtner are completely wasted.The story about vampires and viruses and antidotes is all very pass\u00e9 and comes off like a shiny, chromatic variant on the UNDERWORLD silliness. To make matters worse, this film boasts some of the poorest special effects work I've witnessed in my life \u2013 absolutely awful CGI cityscapes and rubbishy looking explosions and gunfire. The motorbike chase is hilarious awful and one of the worst things I've ever witnessed in my life. I know the makers of this are trying to pass it off as SIN CITY-inspired comic-book-on-screen mayhem, but it just looks like what it is \u2013 amateurish in the extreme. Even the action scenes with their own brand of made-up martial arts called 'gunkata' were done better in EQUILIBRIUM. No, ULTRAVIOLET is a film that's not worth bothering with in the slightest \u2013 a poor, uninteresting excuse for a movie.",

Unfortunately, I cannot do so for this film because I do not know what the film was about.There were many problems with this movie. The directing was terrible. There were many scenes that could have been shot much better. Who wants to see an action scene with an aerial wide angle view? To make matters worse, this view was often the only view that the fighting scenes were shot in. There were times when there were tens of guys trying to kill Milla Jovovich in all directions, but suddenly all these people died after Milla waves her arm. And the corpses formed a neat circle. Haha, were they trying to be the futuristic Da Vinci Code? This film tried too hard to look stylish. There were more than 3 occasions when the bad guys fell to the floor after being shot. They fell one by one as if the were line dancing. It was so choreographed that it became unbelievable and comical. As others have pointed out, weapons materialising in the hands all of a sudden was too unconvincing.The worst part of the movie was that scenes jump from one to the next without explanation. In one scene, Milla & the kid were in a building, with bad guys all around them. There was no escape. The next second, Milla & the kid was already outside the building, without any explanation how they got out of the building! This was just one example. If I quoted all of these ridiculous example, I would be writing down the whole movie.Seriously, avoid this film. It is very bad.",

According to most, Ultraviolet is one of the worst (current IMDb rating: 3.7), but I didn't think it was that bad at all. Not good, either. Just rather mediocre. If you're looking for a big dumb action movie, you could do a lot worse. For much of the film's run, Ultraviolet (Milla Jovovich) runs around slicing people up with little in the way of plot (what there is is fairly confusing). Yeah, the action sequences are laughable, and they do get repetitive, but they're enjoyable in a stupid way. It's only when the film decides to act as if it had a human level that it gets really weak. None of the drama works, mostly because it's difficult to understand what has already happened and what is presently happening. Plus, the action up to a certain point moves at breakneck speed, so it's pretty dumb to slow things down so the characters can actually speak to each other. Less speakie, more killie! Perhaps the movie's worse flaw is a difficult-to-follow climactic sequence. Like most bad sci-fi films, Ultraviolet's main draw is the visual design. However bad everything else might be, the movie looks awesome. It's mostly done with computers, like Sky Captain and Sin City. Some of the movie plays as if you were watching your friend enjoy a (fun) video game. Not especially recommended, but it's better than people have said.",

Milla's battles are with her katana are astounding. Milla's acting is genuine with her connection to 2 individuals in the movie. Thought provoking scenes are apparent but are obviously cut back to save time; another studio mishap. Lastly, the fight scenes are uniquely portrayed with katanas and guns. All in all the movie has vast potential and its uniqueness should not be compared to the other movies such as Matrix, Underworld, and Flux \u0096 just because it falls in that genre.

This movie has an interesting premise, a manufactured virus infects a percentage of the population with a disease which gives vampire like properties such as quick healing, fast moving, ultra hearing, super strength and pointy teeth. Unfortunately the disease also gives you sun short life (10 years or so) span and sunlight harms you. The virus is extremely contagious, just a drop of bodily fluid on the skin is enough, so the (fascist) government is wiping all the \"vampires\" out. A war between the vampires and the government is therefore in place with Violet as some sort of warrior character in the same mold as Seline from Underworld.There the good bits end. Just the plot outline - I imagine this was the pitch that sold the movie to the execs cos after this the actual production of the movie fell apart. I think the studio execs decided to give the film a reasonable budget in the hope that the good premise would turn out a good movie but actually a smaller budget would probably have done this movie more favours. As it is the film is filled with outrageous fight scenes 20 vamps vs Violet (not a scratch on her), 100's of humans vs Violet (not a scratch on her). The fight scenes need more of a mention as the film is virtually entirely made up of them - there is little or no plot or character development and some wild inconsistencies in the bits they do reveal (why does nose guy where all the protective gear given his situation?).Heavy (and i do mean heavy) use of CGI ruins the movie giving it no basis in reality. So you get portable gravity packs that allow a motor bike to ride along the side of buildings or up them (but not the ability to fly???). Worst of all - \"Concealed Weapons\" - in this reality it appears you can pluck weapons (and many weapons) from thin air, these range from samurai swords, machine guns, machine pistols, infinite bullets. This is not explained. In The Matrix - this is explained - The Matrix is not reality and therefore the rules of reality can be broken if you can override your own minds interpretation. Ultra Violet is supposed to be set in reality, albeit a future one, and so there is no excuse for this non-sensical plot devices, simply used so that the fight scenes can be bigger and sillier. If any basis of reality was present Violet would have to keep going back home every 3 minutes to tool up.With a smaller budget the use of CGI would have been restricted and therefore they would have had to base some \"Universe Rules\" in reality and the film would have been better.Acting - fairly wooden and 2 dimensional, and this is being generous. Milla sort of reads her lines out in a flat monotone - virtually no emotional content. Bad guy - again fairly stereotypical, no anger or emotional content to his character either, he just didn't really try. The wee boy - doesn't say much throughout the film and does indeed appear to be mute for a good portion. The Vampire baddie - fairly stereotypical but he ain't in it much so he don't have many lines to say. Vampire love interest, really just the one or 2 lines to indicate this, Violet: \"Why did you bring me back?\", Vampire Love Interest: \"Haven't you guessed?\"- paraphrasing but that is essentially it, he ain't in it much so he don't have many lines to say.The film is essentially - Milla + Bad Guy + Fighting + CGI. Milla not good, bad guy not scary, Fighting too stupid, CGI too over the top. Therefore the movie just gets tedious.",

The story evolves around a super-human/vampiress named Violet, who in stealing a super-powerful weapon from a group of Vampire Maffia's, discovers that she must pit herself in danger to protect a 'vunerable' ten year old boy named Six (Six?)

Jovovich sure has some moves! And the creepy smile of Cameron Bright (Six) is enough to send shivers down my spine (thus the 'mild action and SCARY SCENES) well, i'm not going to say 'make sure you see Ultraviolet' as there are many a greater movie out there which perhaps you would enjoy, however fans of this type of genre may find the action and candy-eyed costumes something to snap up.

Milla is always fun to watch, and she does her usual ass-kicking well; quite possibly her best action work. The kid is adorable, the villain is a prick, and I personally find the idea of riding a motorcyle up a building kinda cool. Alls well in the world. The movie is centered around futuristic vampires, it's not supposed to be realistic. Get a clue people...I've seen people complain about her fending of a whole legion of soldiers without taking a bullet. She's, for all points and purposes, a genetically enhanced super heroine with all kinds of uberness; the impossible is ~what they do~.For those complaining about character development, read the comic book. The same thing could be said about the X-Men movies, accept anyone who hasn't been living under a rock already knows the history of the X-Men so the development wasn't necessary. Did Storm get a chance to talk about her past as a thief and connection to some evil demon entity in Africa? No. Did Wolverine get to mention that Lady Deathstrike was at one point a love interest? No. But I don't hear anyone bitching about them. Why? Because it's already common knowledge. The point to this movie was Milla/Violet's interest in a child and how that child changes her views and perspectives. Clich\u00e9, maybe, but the movie did its job. If you want to know her life story, read a f*cking book.It's not supposed to be rocket science. It's not supposed to be deep.

This movie kept me guessing, on edge, and wanting to watch it over and over again. The unrated extended cut is the DVD version I purchased the day it came out.

Milla J. was mesmerizing -- super-powerful and exceedingly beautiful, but vulnerable -- in the title role. The bleak urban/corporate future portrayed was fascinating, and I don't particularly care about the plausibility of sci-fi plots -- I accept outlandish premises if it makes for a good story.I'm also guessing that aside from lacking gross-out violence the basic goodness and innocence of the main characters and the simple good versus evil nature of the plot were a disappointment to people who prefer sleazy anti-heroes and morally ambiguous stories and outcomes.",

Basically a weird mix of \"Polar Express\" and \"Kill Bill 1\"; with a plot that seems to have randomly selected script elements from every \"Matrix\"-like film produced over the past ten years. When \"Polar Express was first released, many predicted that the substitution of animation for live action would take over the film industry. But they expected this to be driven from the animation side and not from the live action side. But \"Ultraviolet\" shows that this takeover is really being driven by the live action production companies. It is basically is a cartoon with occasional cutaways to actors, interactions between actors and animation, and a voice-over narration. Interestingly, not only is this not a new thing, it actually goes back to the days of silent films. In the early 1920's Max and Dave Fleischer introduced a cartoon series called \"Out of the Inkwell\" which superimposed animated figures on real film backgrounds (allowing a live actor to interact with a cartoon character). Walt Disney (in his pre-Mickey Mouse days ) borrowed the idea for his series of \"Alice\" cartoons (there were 56 cartoons in the series) and even reversed the idea and superimposed a live actress (Virginia Davis) on an animated background. Obviously these early examples are crude by the standards of \"Ultraviolet's\" digital effects but the concept itself is identical.\"Ultraviolent\" is not much of a story but it is decorated with many stunningly beautiful shots of Milla Jovovich as the title character. The story is weaker than the \"Underworld\" series but on a par with most of vampire-Matrix-post apocalyptic-CGI stuff the industry has been cranking out lately; including Milla's \"Resident Evil\" movies. The negative criticism of \"Ultraviolent\" relative to this other garbage is absurd; its all pretty awful but at least here there is an emphasis on the Milla visuals and her costumes are second only to Beckinsale's. They would be as just as good if the costumer realized that flat black presents major contrast problems.Milla can act (see \"Dummy\") but not much is required in that department for \"Ultraviolet\".\"Ultraviolet\" is based on a comic book and the film features loads of lame hyper-edited martial arts scenes that don't require stunt work because they are just microsecond cuts edited together to simulate fighting. \"Ultraviolet's\" plot revolves around a young boy that Milla is trying to protect. They are caught between a government run by the medical establishment and a resistance movement of disease-enhanced humans. That might sound like \"Dark Angel\" but instead of a \"Bladerunner\" production design, think of 1980's \"Flash Gordon\". All in all, \"Ultraviolent\" is as good as most of these futuristic exercises in excess and better than some.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",

Almost made me change my nick to Cleric. Anyways, i think that there is no justification in watching this film at the movies. Simply wait for it to be on TNT or borrow the DVD from a friend. Do not, i repeat, DO NOT waste any money on this movie. Kurt Wimmer has to learn his lesson.",

Some of you say that its plot is similar to a video game, so let me tell you something: even PACMAN has a better plot than this movie.The scene where Violet kills the gunmen of the helicopter in a mid-air shootout, not even in this lame futuristic world is possible that a helicopter just explodes like that. I couldn't believe what i was watching i started laughing so hard that i decided to \"enjoy\" the movie by laughing at it's lameness, not even that was possible.What the hell is so wrong about this virus? everyone just turns out to have more agility and become stronger. Why the hell they become \"vampires\" i don't recall watching any bloodsucking on the film (and i don't dare to watch it ever again just to be certain) Why does everyone have swords when they can materialize automatic weapons out of the clear blue sky? Why in God's name was this movie made? I cant believe that someone would actually want to film this load of crap.(at least it made me register on IMDb, i couldn't remain silent after watching this)",

With everyone on her tail, she must use her skills to not only protect the boy, but to live.I gave Equilibrium a 9, it was truly an amazing film. When I saw the trailer for Ultraviolet, I was as hyped up to see it as I thought I would be. The immediate thought that sprang into my mind was Equilibrium: The Sequel, only this time with Mila fighting the good fight. Throughout the course of the film, you get the sense that there are good parts in it, a snippet here and there. Unfortunately, the editing of a film can change the view of it drastically. For better or worse, films like Donnie Darko, Kingdom of Heaven and Blade Runner all have director's cuts. I would very much like to see this film again, with Wimmer's vision in the editing stages, not Screen Gems. What could have been a bloodbath 120 minute R rated film, turned into an 88 minute PG-13 kid flick.For a studio to take a directors film and totally re-edit it is basically a slap in the face. Poor Wimmer has his name pasted all over this pile of dung heap and I for one feel sorry for him. Not that what he had was all that great to begin with, but I can see a rating being higher then a 2 with a director's cut. So where does this film fault? Pretty much everywhere. It's main pitch to the audience was it's \"wow\" factor in the fight scenes. Some are good, some are pretty bad....like do we really need to see a fight through each and every person's shades? It's disorienting and horribly done.Mila is wooden here and Bright plays the exact same character in every single film he does. He's that creepy kid. This one of two films where he plays a boy that is known as a \"cure\". He does absolutely nothing, other then running with the main character and saying wooden lines that are suppose to make our hero \"feel\" something.To be completely honest, I did not know this film was about vampires until have way through it, when I saw the teeth and was like, \"what the hell is going on here?\". Would it have been a better film if I has known it was about vampires, probably not. Why even have the vampire story in here, they do not use it at all. There is no vampire mythology in here. They could have simply made something up, \"alien blood\" in their system, or some other crap excuse to \"cure\" them, but vampires? The lead villain has no memorable factors about it, whatsoever. He's boring, inane and most of all pointless.When you see a scene with the lead female on a motorcycle, that is riding on the side of a building because she used some kind of gravity device, you know you're in for a \"cool look at this scene\" type of film...house of the dead anyone? To say that Wimmer is the next Uwe Boll, is not fair. Equilibrium is an astounding film, and Ultraviolet, although a big, big misstep, is not the end of his career. Ultraviolet is a film you can definitely decide to skip when you see it sitting on the shelf in a video store. If you're looking for something to equal Equilibrium, look somewhere else please. This film is in no way an entertaining movie. The only chance I will give it, is when I see \"DC\" on the cover.",

And how true.This movie was somewhat confusing, i.e. The hemo-phages are supposed to be vampires, but they walk around during the day and don't ever suck blood...and then they eventually die? I've heard that this same non-blood-sucking vampire deal is also like Blade (although I haven't seen Blade, so I can't say..). The plot was also confusing as the villain said their master plan rather quickly as if it weren't that important. I get what the villain was trying to do, but why? Also in the movie...color changing Violet? This was also shown in some of the trailers...How come she changes colors? It's kind of cool, and I guess then it doesn't need a purpose.I also thought this movie was too short for all the stuff that needed some explaining. Something like 85 minutes? I was surprised that it wasn't at least two hours like most movies today.This movie wasn't great...but what kept me there were the kick-ass fighting scenes. Some might not agree, but I thought it was definitely awesome. Violet has the coolest guns ever and the coolest storage for them and she was pretty kick-ass herself.What also kept me there was the technology stuff they had. All the stuff they had was just so amazing and just makes me think about how the world might end up (minus vampires). Even down to a backpack in the movie, I thought it was cool.The script wasn't that great...I'm pretty sure the actors said *the* cheesiest lines.

It's just an annoying style-feature for nothing.2) Fights in the movie are all boring to death. \"V\"s wins. Ever. Even when there are 700 (!) people trying to kill her at the same time. She's just like Superwoman without any real opponent...3) CGIs are horrible! Even some TV-Shows have better special effects than this movie, Especially when it comes to landscapes or buildings. Sometimes you'll feel like at the beginning of blue-screen technology at all.4) The movie has no logic at all. Facts are changing during the whole movie. Don't even try to ask yourself things like \"Where did that come from?\" or \"How did she get there?\" You'll get mad. There are definitely no reasons available for anything in this movie. No rules to stick on, no orientation point. Everything is possible, at any time.5) Vampirism? What the hell is in that movie that is connected to this topic? Only the sharp teeth? Again a totally useless style and merchandise item.6) The dialogs are really stupid, over all pathetic in a way thats not fitting at all and in-consequent.7) The characters are flat like a mirror. No character development, no depths. And what's worse: Especially \"V\" seems to be changing her mood the way she feels and way of thinking in secs. She's totally in-consequent, a different person in every scene.8) The scenes are totally unconnected. In one second the story and characters are here... In the next one they are there, without any link between locations and situations. You will lose orientation during the movie. maybe a compass would help, don't know...9) The evil guys are more stupid than a piece of sh**. Guards standing there, leaving \"V\" her time to come in slowly, taking a look around... just like they were stoned or something. Think they all lost their will for life long ago and just waited for their death.10) Holograms. If there is a hole in the story: Fill it with holograms. The problem: Don't use this trick too often. More than one time a movie is a sign of real poor story-writing...Finally: This movie is a bad mixture of elements from Kill Bill, Equilibrium, Vendetta and Aeon Flux without any frame. Empty streets, a nameless city, an unknown world and a story thats just brain-twisting.My recommendation: Burn your copy! Don't watch it!",

            "content": "Milla Jovovich appeared in one of my all-time favorite sci-fi action comedies (The Fifth Element), but she also holds the title of \"Most Overused Female Actress\" in some really shoddy flicks (Resident Evil, Dummy, and Return to the Blue Lagoon just to touch on a few). So I hesitate whenever I see her name attached to a title. Perhaps her agent needs to be a bit more selective when handing her manuscripts.So it is with a heavy heart that I have to say her unfortunate role selections seem to have no end in sight with the addition of ULTRAVIOLET to her sagging film repertoire.Vampires (aka Hemophages) have been done to death, but I don't mind that. If a story is interesting and contains vampires, hey, that's fine by me. But shoving Milla into a body-fitting, white leather outfit and having her kick butt in almost every scene makes me think that much more could've been made out of this film rather than just a vampiric female ruffian who's deadly with a blade. Swinging swords and Matrix-like action sequences were all one gets to see here ...that and some really bad CGI (harkening back to the days of TRON).The story of vampires and humans battling for supremacy is nothing new to film, too, and it would've been nice to see more character development surrounding Milla's Violet character and that of the main antagonist, Vicecardinum Ferdinand Daxus played by Nick Chinlund. But we just are led to believe that the two hate each other because they're on opposite sides of the human/vampire equation. Or are they? It seems the scriptwriters/filmmakers couldn't make up their minds about that either. What a mess.The story tries to pull a sympathetic chord with the audience by explaining that Violet lost a child in-utero, so when she starts feeling empathy for Six (Cameron Blight), a young boy who carries a virus that can wipe out all vampires (or can he?), we (the audience) are supposed to support her decision not to kill the very child who could kill her. But the emotional impact is nil, again, since almost all of the film time is dedicated to swordplay, killing, and showing us how nice Milla looks in her leathers while decapitating a few hundred bad guys at a time.There have been comparisons made between Ultraviolet and AEON FLUX. I've seen and rated both of these films and found the latter much more entertaining than the former. Although both films had deadly women as their prime protagonists, Aeon Flux actually had a story behind it with some intriguing concepts, while Ultraviolet simply put a futuristic bent on a worn-out theme.",

            "review_title": "Ultraviolet-- Live Action Anime Awry",
            "content": "At best Kurt Wimmer's \"Ultraviolet\" is an entertaining B-movie-- an ambitious clumsy attempt at live action Anime. The distinctly seamed transitions between live action and CGI are both bewildering and perplexing. Truly, \"Ultraviolet\" faired better in its trailers. That being said, I found \"Ultraviolet\" predictably entertaining primarily due to its charismatic star Milla Jovovich. Jovovich is gorgeous. With her long lean body baring her flat stomach and streaming black hair, she is hot. Also as Violet she possesses a similar kind of screen presence that Hugh Jackman brought to \"X-Men\" as Wolverine. Granted that is a very contemporary reference and that \"X-Men\" is a much better movie, Jovovich's star power compensates for some of \"Ultraviolet\"'s inequities. Not all. Director and Writer Kurt Wimmer previously employed an innovative cross of gun play and martial arts in his \"Equilibrium\". That trademark is also present in \"Ultraviolet\". Wimmer invents the concept of \"flat plane\" technology as a means of arming Violet without altering her sleek wardrobe. \"Ultraviolet\" has glimmers of style when it is not overly mired in CGI. The movie is a dichotomy: there is a cool look about it; otherwise, some of the effects are well, cheesy.Set sometime later in the 21st century, a super race of soldier is created induced by a generated virus. This vampire-like race is called Hemophages. Hemophages have acute intelligence and reflexes, and great strength and speed. Unfortunately the Hemophages go rogue. Vice Cardinal and World Leader Daxus (Nick Chinlund) is systematically exterminating the Hemophages\u0097a race he basically created. Violet (Jovovich) had a normal life until she became a Hemophage\u0097a victim of the experimental plague. Violet now a deadly warrior joins the Resistance against Daxus in these \"Blood Wars\". Violet aligns herself with Resistance Leader Nerva (Sebastien Andrieu). Violet intercepts a weapon designed by the Government to eradicate the Hemophages. Violet uses her warrior prowess to obtain the weapon, only to discover that the weapon is a 9 year-old named Six (Cameron Bright), who was raised in the government laboratories. Upon further investigation employing the resources of scientist and friend Garth (William Fichtner), the threat Six poses is unclear. Though what is certain: Six is dying. So Violet must save Six and uncover Daxus's conspiracy.Milla Jovovich is the only redeeming feature of \"Ultraviolet\". Once past Wimmer's convoluted set up, all that remains is disposing of the villains and saving the young child Six. Jovovich has great physicality and style. No doubt she trained long and hard for her role. When not overly edited her martial arts sequences are clean and brutal. Jovovich plays Violet cool and somewhat aloof. Her Violet is a sleek Terminator \"chick\" tempered with honor and a resistant motherly instinct. Our hero also speaks plainly. When told she will not get out of the lab alive, Violet says, \"Watch me.\" She is renegade loner hero chic. Cameron Bright elicits the right sympathy as Six, who is not at all what he first appears to be. Nick Chinlund is charming and forceful, providing a formidable nemesis for Violet. Wimmer's narrative twist works in the movie context. Otherwise, his story is rather predictable. If you have no interest or affinity for Jovovich, don't see \"Ultraviolet\". Jovovich has a genuine screen presence and style. She just needs to select more deserving screen projects.",

Mainly because it was kind of unusual and fairly well written.It also is an action movie that doesn't suffer the crippling ailment of an ensemble cast that occasionally damage the story.My one beef is the way the planes at the beginning are continuously circling the tower without being attacked.

See, this is an action movie. And despite the obvious lack of character development, an action movie can still work reasonably well with just its action. That didn't happen here.It didn't happen because the director has no idea how to shoot or pace action. In just about every action scene, the camera is never in the right place. It's never in a place that is even just good. Sometimes it frames the action OK, but it is never where it ought to be to really capture the moment.Combine the poor cinematography with simply bad pacing. Whoever storyboarded these fight scenes have no idea how to pace action in a movie like this. Violet is shown to be a God from beginning to end. At no time is there any form of tension about whether she is going to be able to kill this room full of guys. At the beginning, she's able to take on groups of 3-5 with ease. At the end, when she's taking on 20-30, there is no less ease.This movie so desperately wants to be Kill Bill or the Matrix, but it has no idea what makes those action sequences work. The Bride may have slaughtered a room full of guys, but it took her 10 minutes, and it was not easy. She was breathing heavily through the fight, was retreating to keep them from grouping around her too much, and various other things. These all combine to make the sequence work.When Violet kills people, she basically stands there and either dodges bullets and shoots them, or dodges bullets and cuts them down with her sword. At no time does she make any reasonable effort to avoid bad positioning in fights, etc. All of this combines to destroy any sense of tension in any of the fight sequences.The most that the audience has to look forward to is answering the question, \"How is she going to get out of this?\" Unfortunately, the cinematography ruins even that. And sometimes a battle resolution happens off-screen, so you don't even see how she took out those 30 guys.And so, like any imitation of greatness, it lumbers along from beginning to end, trying to do what the director thinks those movies were doing, rather than understanding why the movies did what they did.No matter what scenes are added back to the theatrical version, these fundamental problems will not be fixed. Maybe it would move it up to a rating of 5 stars, which would be merely average, but that's not exactly the kind of rating that a director should be looking for.",

There is nothing interesting here other than a model surrounded by fuzzy looking special effects walking on a ceiling and talking into a paper phone (actually events in the film). In reality, this movie was about as tolerable as watching someone stomp a sack of kittens to death.There is nothing worth describing here. The action dances between sappy and insulting, the characters are unremarkable, the writing juvenile and impossibly formulaic, and the plot was almost a punch line. Wimmer could have pinched a loaf on a stack of paper and it would have been better written than this writhing abomination.I cannot stress enough how much you should avoid this thing.

The action is fast and intense but so much so that I plain felt overwhelmed.Milla Jovovich is splendid as Violet. But I'm prejudiced, I think she's one of the loveliest and most striking actresses around. There wasn't (to be honest) much opportunity to show her real acting chops in this movie ... for that, see her in The Messenger, where she turns in a top rate acting performance that to me is simply top notch from beginning to end. But I digress. Her role as Violet is more of a reminder of her previous roles in The Fifth Element and the wonderful Resident Evil. And she turns in good, solid performances in all of these; and here is no different. Cameron Bright likewise does a solid job, as he did in Running Scared. This young man looks to have a great future ahead of him.Two fight scenes I really liked were (without giving away anything really ... the rooftop fight scene and the library fight scene. The other fight scenes were all punchy, vivid, action-packed a la Matrix, Kill Bill, but not really as good as these others. The music supported the movie well and overall the intensity and pacing and feel of a video game was maintained well.One thing I liked about the cinematography was the sort of softened edges to ... well, everything, but especially to Violet's face and form ... which made for a very appealing, very sexy, and very lovely image wherever she appeared on screen; which was almost everywhere.The plot was poor but in this kind of movie I don't know that that's too big of a strike against the movie; but there were several gaping plot holes that left me frustratingly distracting. Dialog was sparse, stylized, and full of a kind of campy humor that to me work very well ... think of predecessors like Kill Bill.All in all worth seeing, IMHO, but not nearly as engaging as other similar movies.",

            "content": "Incredibly, this one proved to be even worse than AEON FLUX (2005), which I watched recently! For starters, it looks - and feels - more like a video game than a movie; besides, the bland futuristic setting and the trite plot (concerning humans vs. vampires, again!) offer nothing at all new.Despite virtually non-stop action, this is mostly laughable - especially when considering just how many times heroine Milla Jovovich (a veritable one-woman army) is surrounded by scores of heavies, only to emerge unscathed from the carnage; one rooftop scene even has them killing each other as she contrives to avoid all their bullets! The impossibly slender star (with her constantly bare midriff almost a character in itself!) is sexy but expressionless in her role; while certainly the only eye-catching element in the film, ultimately, she's just a pale shadow of Uma Thurman in the \"Kill Bill\" movies (2003/4)! A subplot involving child actor Cameron Bright - whose blood, ostensibly, is a weapon for the vampires' annihilation but could also provide an antidote to their 'disease' - doesn't help, especially when it descends into sentimentality. The scene when Jovovich opens a case (shaped like a toilet basin!) she's been ordered to retrieve only to find the comatose boy inside is just too surreal for words!! At one point, the villain utters the line \"What a pathetic picture!\"; never was an unintended self-reference more truly spoken!",

If you loved films like the matrix, Aeon Flux, Equilibrium then this is a must.

            "content": "I hate to say this, but Ultraviolet is this year's Elektra. It's a bad hybrid of Aeon Flux, Underworld, Resident Evil and Elektra combined using the production style of Sky Captain, shot against digitally created scenes. Not that it is bad though, I actually sincerely believed, from the trailer, that it had potential to be a really good Milla Jovovich vehicle. Sadly, I was quite disappointed.While Charlize Theron and Kate Beckinsale had ample opportunity to prove their action chops in skin tight Lycra in Aeon Flux and Underworld respectively, I thought Milla already had proved hers, in Resident Evil, and The Fifth Element. Here, she plays Violet, a vampire-ish humanoid with the really strange technologically enhanced prowess.Directed and written by Kurt Wimmer (who actually did the cult hit Equilibrium), Ultraviolet takes what's currently the talk of the down - epidemic disease (ala Resident Evil), which had mutated and infected humans, and after a number of hokey mambo jumbo, some humans become a race of Hemophage, aka humans with vampire-like abilities of stealth and such. Anyway don't bother yourself with the \"science\" behind this film, as it's sci-fi fantasy anyway.Just enough to know that Violet is on a quest against a dictator (ala Aeon Flux), but circumstances turn her own against her when she decides to intervene and save a boy called Six. Six is this movie's Leeloo, a being who can cure Hemophages, or kill them, or kill Humans, or, what the heck! Violet plays surrogate mom (because of her past) to Six, and the two form an pseudo-mother-son relationship, as she does battle against the authorities, and her kind.Just as you thought, from the trailers, that the action will be uber-stylish. There are a number of cool things, like Violet's clothing changing color like a chameleon to suit her environment, and her virtual-turn-real weapons with endless bullet rounds reloaded from the veins in her wrists, which you gotta see to believe. But here's where the problem is. She's indestructible, like a female Terminator who just keeps going. What put me off were the many fight scenes which just didn't happen. It's lazy, she's that good, but still? You see one woman up against countless villains, and the next minute, they all fall down dead. Without seeing her move a muscle. what gives? And there are dozens of \"mega\" fight scenes done in the same manner, which became laughable instead of cool, bordering on the absurd. What is unforgivable too is the finale fight scene, done 90% in the dark. Yes, to prove a plot point and for some out of the ordinary action, but grr...Surprisingly, most of the effects were done by a China digital production team, which made me wonder why this was leaps and bounds ahead of The Promise in terms of effects. It's also a crew team mainly of Hong Kongers and Chinese, makes you wonder about the progress made in China though on film production. Slick effects, but let down by an ultra-weak plot, and cop-out action sequences. Just for those curious, this movie was shot using Sony's high-definition digicam, and coupled with the post-production, really made Milla's skin look absolutely fabulous and flawless in simulated soft focus.I think it's already a staple to have a shot of the actress's butt in skin tight Lycra, as did Aeon Flux, Underworld, and this movie too. But cool shots do not make a good movie, and an extremely bad plot makes it worse. Having bad action just makes it harder to swallow and digest. However, don't worry Milla, I still love you :-) Cool Trailer + Hot Trailer Music = Awesome promotional material. And that's the only thing you should remember the movie by.",

In a future world the government has experimented on a rare and obscure virus seeking to make super soldiers. They succeed but the side effect is that it is super highly contagious, the host needs repetitive blood transfusions and will die within 12 years of infection. The disease escapes confinement and the world lives in terror of infection. Those infected are rounded up into camps, are experimented on inhumanly and coldly exterminated, until they decided to fight back. This starts the war between humans and those infected called haemophages. UltraViolet is Violet (called Vee by friends) who was pregnant when she was infected, and the inhuman experiments carried out on her finally killed her unborn child after she had carried it for 9 months. Then she escaped and now she fights back and is the haemophages top agent and killer. Thats the background into which this world, the comic and this movie takes place. In the comic Violet always gets into impossible situations against impossible odds with her catch phrase \"watch me\" and uses her super senses and abilities to destroy and escape, the movie keeps this tradition alive In the film the humans are on the verge of outright victory and have a weapon that when atomised into the atmosphere will kill all haemophages. Violet is sent to recover and destroy it and the action begins. The only problem arises when Violet discovers that the virus has been grown inside a human boy and both humans and haemophages want to kill the boy. The first to disperse the virus, the latter to destroy it. But Violet can't standby and watch a child be killed and so becomes the target of all sides.With an uncomplicated plot that won't win any Oscars, this film concentrates on style and action. Both of which it excels in so well. Violets outfits and hair change colour to her moods and surroundings, and looks so cool, as do the locations. But the action is simply breath taking, the fight scenes beautifully choreographed, and reminiscent of the first Matrix film. No excess wire work here making a mockery of the fight scenes, she's faster and stronger as per the plot, but the scenes are not totally unbelievable, like many stylised hong kong movies, although it does have its moments. But the best part for action junkies is that its none stop throughout the movie. Rarely 10 minutes will pass without another fight scene, a mixture of martial arts, blades and guns that both mesmerises and delights. Its like watching a trailer, were all the brilliant action scenes are blended into one continuous high octane five minutes that grabs and thrills you. Only this five minutes lasts the entire movie and sets a standard no other action film has lived up to. This is simply the most fun movie I have ever watched. Its simplicity, style and beautiful action never fails to delight, and I have already lost track of the number of times I have watched it.",

Any movie with her is going to be a turkey. and 2) They didn't show it to critics beforehand. Almost always a sign they have a turkey.Still, with those lowered expectations, it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be. I think that it had some strange Sci-Fi hooks in it (weapons being pulled from pocket dimensions, a society where the medical companies establish a quasi-theocratic dictatorship. ) I think it could have been a better movie if they spent more time on character development and less on action sequences.Anyway, here's the plot. Scientists discover the vampire virus, and attempt to use it to create a super-soldier. INstead, they create a class of infected vampire people who need to be exterminated because their HMO's don't cover being a vampire. Or something. Anyway, the world has been taken over by a medical establishment that for some unknown reason, calls their leader a \"Cardinal\" and uses Christian imagery.Now, I am not sure why being a vampire is a bad thing in this movie, because we never see any vampires (or \"hemophages\", as they are called) actually drinking any blood.Anyway, the Evil Medical Establishment has developed an ultimate weapon. Somehow, Mila manages to infiltrate their headquarters and steal the weapon, which turns out to be a little boy. It turns out the boy carries a vampire killing germ and she doesn't have the heart to let the other vampires kill him.The rest of the movie is just an excuse to hang one action scene after another on.

Well, I can start by saying: Don't listen to people, when they say, that you should buy the full version. What is already in this movie is bad and adding more can't save the awful dialogue and the ridiculous action scenes.The CG can be saved, hopefully if they intend to give Kurt more money to that, but I doubt it. I do understand the studio for stopping this project, before it got worse. I wish that Charlie's Angels 2 also was made by the same studio as well.One thing I do like about the movie is the soundtrack. Klaus Badelt did a good job on creating themes. But it was a waste of his talent.The relationship between Violet and the little boy is some of the most retarded and stupid things I have ever seen. It was so laughable sometimes, and (the scene at the playground cracked me up) the dialogue delivered from both of them was plain stupid.The Blood Chinois sequence was incredibly bad. The background was like this big 2D painting, which it obviously was. The editing of the scene was bad as well, so was the long-drawn start where the camera zooms through the eyes and focus on throats. The whole fight itself was nonsense. Violet making flips and jumping around couldn't save her life.Also another classic is the fist fight, when Violet kills 10-20 \"super\" soldiers by hitting them with a destroyed gun. What was that? Few of them also fell to the ground, causing their armor to shatter into a million pieces. Ridiculous like the movie it self.The whole building race sequence was propably the worst. The thing, where she makes it to the top and lands with the bike on the roof top cracked me up. Bad VFX. I can't believe they managed to get it that bad. Well, then the sequence ends with Violet \"flying\" (Don't know how she managed to pull that of) through the helicopter and into a building.Oh, then there is the dialogue. Stupid, rushed and incredible that the script was even greenlighted. The movie has some \"great\" (sarcasm) examples like: \"Do you believe in God\" (which is spoken in the most inappropriate situation) and \"You are all gonna' die\".Kurts Equilibrium was great movie. I enjoyed it very much, but this is just bullshit. How can someone make such a good movie like Equilibrium and suddenly make something as awful as Ultraviolet? There is big mystery to be solved here.Also when you see that this movie actually has FANS (believe it or not.

            "content": "SPOILERS BELOW The short version: do not waste your time on this piece of crap called \"Ultraviolet\". Writer/director Kurt Wimmer is not an untalented fellow, but this is an example of utter self-indulgence gone horribly wrong. All the good will I felt towards him as a result of Equilibrium is now officially dissipated.The long version: The movie is an utter mess, starting with the opening credit sequence: a series of comic book covers depicting the titular heroine in typical action poses, kicking lots of ass. Sounds good on paper, right? Except that the movie was not adapted from a comic book. So why imply it? To try to catch some of the shine off movies that were translated from comics? That can't be it, since that idea is lame. Huh. And the thing goes on way too long before the movie starts.But wait, it doesn't really start. Next comes the prologue, the VO from a cracky-voiced Milla Jovovich (according to rumor she is a heavy pot smoker, which may explain both the voice and her choice of career material) explaining the plot set-up. And boy, is it a doozy.While trying to create super soldiers, some unknown government accidentally creates vampires.I'll let that sink in for a minute.Still there? Too bad for you.These ass kicking vampires are short-lived, though; their bodies burn out in twelve years. Kind of like \"Blade Runner\"'s replicants, but vampires.So, here we are like five or six minutes into the movie, and we still have no movie. Wait, the narration has ended and we're watching a pointless action sequence! Yay! Wait, it looks like pooh! Not the fight choreography or the costumes, but the effects. Yes, this looks like another \"shot against green screen with minimal sets\" thing. For the last time, people, Lucas got away with it because the final result looked amazing. \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\" failed on its merits as a movie, but not because of its overall look. But \"Immortal\" and now \"Ultraviolet\" have both proved that, unless you have a giant megabudget, you really ought to stick to sets for now.Next, some people walk around and talk about stuff. Oh, it's the bad guy. Nick Chinlund plays him with a little zest as the film goes on, but he and his assistant are given exposition to mouth in their introduction. You know, the kind of dialogue no-one would ever really speak because the characters already know this stuff? Sloppy storytelling has really been the order of the day as we finally meet Violet. She pulls up on a motorcycle and is revealed as a courier to take something from point A to point B. After passing a scan, she walks through a seemingly endless (read: tedious) series of tunnels and corridors and body scans and more tunnels and corridors on her way to pick up the something.By this time, I was getting angry with the film. Who is this Violet, why does she keep changing colors based on the environment, and why should I care about any of this since I haven't seen a single authentic human reaction or behavior since this thing started? Ridiculous action sequences start from here and continue on almost nonstop until the end of the movie. The fight choreography is nice, Milla Jovovich has an interesting midriff (amply displayed throughout) and... there's one funny line from Nick Chenlund. I'll give it away so that you won't have to watch the movie to hear it. Violet is facing about twenty-two jillion guards all by herself. Nick looks at her as she stands determined and fearless and asks her, \"Are you mental?\" The real problem with Ultraviolet isn't the tired plot, the uninvolving set-up or the cheesy look of the film. It's the lack of vulnerability of Violet. She kills untold numbers of people in the movie and never gets anything worse than a scratch. It's never explained, but she's even more kick ass than all her own vampire brethren (as she gets rid of a bunch of them with utter ease, too). She is literally invulnerable.Plus, she's living with a death sentence. She will die at a certain time (remember the twelve year limit?) very soon. This can spur characters on to do things they didn't know they could do, which is good for storytelling, but when the main character can't be harmed and has nothing personally to lose, what the hell's the point? Oh, and Kurt: very droll, that little bit where one character asks another, \"Has the third act started yet?\" and the other replies, \"It's just about to.\" Yeah, I know how a screenplay is mechanically constructed, too. Good for you. Too bad you didn't read the part where Syd Field tells you about developing people we care about.Milla: you are stereotyped, Leeloo. Is this and the \"Resident Evil\" movies really all the work you can get these days? Time for a new agent, sweetie.\"Ultraviolet\" makes the live action \"Aeon Flux\" movie look like a masterpiece.",

Here are some good things to be said about Ultraviolet: cool special effects, great scenery, nice weapons, and funky costumes. Here are some not-so-good things to be said about the movie: really bad acting, confusing plot, really cheesy moments at the most awkward times, unbelievable action sequences (even more so than Transporter 2), incoherent screen shot sequences, lame one-liners, and (at times) sappy music. At times, I found myself thinking: does the director really think I'm that stupid? Throughout the movie, people keep asking Violet if she was crazy or \"mental\" for continuing on her violent rampage. Ultimately, I think questions of sanity should be reserved for anyone who goes to see this movie in light of what I and others will no doubt write about it.

So did I love it well yeah because I see the film it could have been if it was finished and is it gonna get in my DVD collection, you bet but will it enter my heart like EQULIBRIUM, SADLEY NO",

Even on its own merits the film is a shameless rip-off of X-Men, Aeon-Flux and Kill Bill's fight choreography and adds nothing new to the table. It's pretty damn worthless. Milla Jovovich is trying to channel Charlize Theron and Uma Thurman; but has even MORE lifelessness in her performance than Scarlett Johanson's Lucy. I know that Lucy was made further down the track, but Jovovich is basically saying the lines here like Johanson was with Lucy: just as dull and just as devoid of character. When she cries it's just that: crying without any real meaning to it. The production value means well, given that this film was shot in then-new- innovator-of-film-recording: high-definition digital video. Besides the sometimes well-shot and planned fight scenes, the story is underwhelming the characters bland the action otherwise by the numbers even during the important moments, and damn the music is just typical we-can-still-make-this-work fanfare that is instantly forgettable.I never saw it when it first came out, but now that I have thanks to Netflix, Jesus Christ is it bad.",

            "content": "The concept of a minority, one that meets the UN definition, at war with a majority bent on its destruction, is a tried and true concept in Hollywood. Bryan Singer rode it to astounding success in the X-Men franchise. It helps to know that in this instance, a minority means the group has diminished control over its collective life compared to a majority group, has distinctive cultural and linguistic characteristics, but most importantly, membership is involuntary. The haemophages of Ultraviolet meet almost all of this criteria, so their story would almost automatically be interesting in the hands of a competent storyteller. Unfortunately, Kurt Wimmer manages to make himself look more like a Brett Ratner than a Bryan Singer here. Of course, the studio was no help in that it cut a lot of footage or exposition that the film's peculiar characteristic might have depended upon, but there are so many problems on display here that one really cannot see how they can all be fixed. Put simply, Ultraviolet is a concept with potential that has been utterly flushed away.The story proper introduces us to a phobic world in which individuals with what appears to be a degenerative disease are mercilessly hunted by a majority populace that hates and fears them. (Sound familiar yet?) The plot concerns itself with the development of a weapon or device that has the potential to utterly exterminate this minority. (This idea, sadly, is very much reflected in reality.) Where it all goes off the rails is that the director/writer throws in a deluge of concepts or ideas and fails in giving the audience the time or means to digest them all. Probably the best analogy for this difficulty lies in the Gun Kata. This concept was introduced to us in Wimmer's debut film, Equilibrium. There, the choreographer took control and developed the Gun Kata into a concept that could take ludicrous Rambo-style action sequences and make them vaguely believable. Wimmer has stated that he intended the Gun Kata to be far more different in form, and maybe he has a point. Unfortunately, the cinematography of Ultraviolet leads me to far prefer Equilibrium.I will be brutally honest. Although Equilibrium's photography does not hold a candle to the excellent steady framing offered by such directors as Paul Verhoeven or Cy Endfield, it is still clear enough enough of the time to make what the participants are doing clear. Not so with Ultraviolet. Ultraviolet has some of the worst photography it has ever been my displeasure to witness, and I have seen films that have induced seizures. Maybe Kurt thinks a static position is boring, but I have news for him: the first and foremost rule of cinematography is shoot a sequence with as few changes in camera position or zoom as is humanly possible. This gives the human eye the ability to focus on what is happening, which in turn allows the brain to focus and involve itself in what is taking place. If you need further proof that shaky-cam has the exact opposite effect to what is intended, then take note of what happens the next time you see a car coming at twice the speed limit in the opposite direction. I guarantee you, you will at least feel mildly confused and alarmed.Another big problem for Ultraviolet lies in the editing. Exposition might stop a film dead in its tracks, but it also anchors the viewer in the film when done correctly. Take for example the scenes in Equilibrium where the Clerics return to their city after destroying a building full of people and their art. Although most of the explanation has already been delivered in an opening narration, listening to Sean Bean and Christian Bale talk about what they do and why, along with the images that show how they fit into society, make it all concrete. In Ultraviolet, no such exposition is even offered. Characters are simply introduced then directed to attack each other. In that sense, it is no different from most pornographic films, except pornographic films take good care to make sure the payoff is at least satisfying. So to deal this film the worst putdown it can earn itself, it truly resembles a porn film that has no proverbial money shot. It is literally the biggest waste of eighty-eight minutes one can dream of.Another commentator has claimed this film was unjustly compared to \"bigger movies\". The previous year, Serenity was made on the exact same budget, and while I thought I would never hear myself defending Serenity, it is by far a better film. Although Serenity was just as poor at giving the action a solid basis from which the audience could invest themselves, the scenes flowed together and made sense. There were no sudden leaps into a park with two characters spinning about with smiles on their faces (yes, you read that right). One understood why the more prominent villains did what they did, even if the specifics of the broader society were a little unclear. And that is probably the biggest problem with Ultraviolet. Everything is so crude and two-dimensional that the deliberate choice to make every set brightly-coloured seems more like a desperate attempt to differentiate the film rather than a precise artistic decision. Ultraviolet shows a director desperate for ideas throwing mud at a canvas and seeing what sticks.For this reason, I gave Ultraviolet a two out of ten. It is astoundingly bad, yet takes itself far too seriously to be any fun in the process. Avoid at all costs.",

This is the best looking movie I've seen since \"House of Flying Daggers\" and, before that, \"Hero\". I rather wish the action sequences had better camera coverage. I didn't see many strikes. However, Mila Jovavich moves like a runway supermodel and is completely convincing in her numerous action scenes. I found her scenes with Cameron Bright (\"Six\") and William Finscher (\"Garth) to be quite touching. Through in great sound and music and you have a boss action movie. There's too many unexplained elements in \"Ultraviolet\" for me to rate it too highly. However, even with it's shortcomings, I give \"Ultraviolet\" a \"6\".",

So be it, I thought this was a very fast paced ultra cool thrill ride. It has loads of action at the front of the movie and the end, the middle is filled with plot devices and more spread apart action. The movie reminded me of two other sci-fi action movies that didn't do all that well at the box office either \"Freejack\" and \"Johnny Mneumonic\" and throw in some \"Blade\" and \"Resident Evil\" and there ya go. Milla was great in this movie, well to me anyway and I loved the action and the guns and the sword fighting. The plot has a world with people who are normal and those infected with a type of vampirism. Our hero has this disease and it makes her a serious butt kicker. She is on a mission at the beginning to retrieve a mysterious package, and this expands to her protecting a mysterious boy who may have a cure for the disease or he may just kill all the vampires. Like I said lot of action ensues...and Milla is just to hot in this one and I love her every changing clothes, her every changing really tight clothes. Man she has a very sexy mid section. Well anyways, I would read other reviews before deciding to see this one, because I am in the minority in really enjoying this one, however I will say give it a chance.

            "content": "I really wanted to like Ultraviolet. From the writer and director of Equilibrium, Kurt Wimmer creates an alternative future where an ancient virus from Eastern Europe turns ordinary humans into vampires. An Orwellian government, bent of destroying the vampires, creates a weapon that will destroy them all. Milla Jovovich plays the comic-book inspired heroine who was infected with the virus and held for the humans to conduct experiments on her through various tests. The testing nearly kills her, which kills the child in her womb. She is sent by the vampire faction to capture the weapon and destroy it.So this film pretty much failed at everything. The entire story was told in the opening narration, and the rest of it was a series of vivid battles with a variety of uniform enemies with no faces, and no cause for existence. There isn't any story development, and some elements come from nowhere and go nowhere. There are peripheral enemies that are not introduced or explained, and Milla just decimates them, and there is nary mention of them after; there is a love story that lasts all of two lines; there is not a lot more. The acting is terrible, of course they weren't given much dialog to work with either. It seems as if Wimmer took a bunch of different ideas (each of which are interesting) and threw them together into a vomitorium. Even the graphics were sub-par. Some scenes looked amazing, and would make a good Blu-ray Disc reference piece, but the rest of it looked two generations old. The city was a tiled texture, the vehicles were smooth and polygonal, and the fire, smoke and glass (especially in the last scene) didn't even look rendered.I didn't watch this one with expecting much considering its short life in theaters and the really bad review from critics, but I was still disappointed. If you want to watch something on your new high-def TV, this might make for a good view for friends, but otherwise you probably want to avoid it.",

Sadly, it just looks absolutely ****. How did they manage that? They had to deliver a Guns & Blades Movie with a PG-13 rating, so all the fights are \"coreographed\" so that no blood ever spills on screen. Sadly, it just makes all battles totally unengaging and laughable: Violet's blades never even become bloody, no matter how many men she stabs! How did they ever think it would work? The movie is also horribly overwritten, forgetting the Rule of Cool: Unless your movie is Inception or The Matrix, do NOT try combining the cool and the cerebral - just pose like hell and don't outstay your welcome. Even at 88 minutes the movie manages to be too long. The six minutes longer unrated version is not likely to improve the movie because of the final \"how?\" How can the movie look so painfully unreal that after 20 minutes your eyes are likely to start bleeding? When the prevents the viewer from suspending their disbelief and constantly screams at the viewer that they are watching a lousy, lousy movie, any attraction for the movie is impossible.One of the worst \"movies\" I've ever seen.

Character development? None. I've seen rolling paper with more depth than any of the cardboard cutouts in this film.I really can't tell you what the film got right because there was nothing even remotely \"right\" about this film. I didn't bother clicking the \"spoiler\" box because that would imply that there was a plot to spoil. The soundtrack was an irritating cross between semi-symphonic and techno which would suddenly stop so someone could spout some sort of random and preposterous line or Milla could either \"dramatically\" remove or put on her shades.And what was with the biohazard symbol... everywhere?? OK guys! I GET it! There's a disease around. There's no need to drive the point through our heads like a railway spike! I mean jeez...the DVD box, the building, hell, even Violet's gun flash (regular bullet shooting guns, mind you, in this super futuristic world \"we might not understand\") came out as biohazard shapes! The whole film was just Violet getting surrounded by 80 black clad guys with the universe's worst aim and Violet mowing them all down with her super-duper machine pistols which she could dispense out of her wrist... or something. If they weren't using regular bullet-shooting guns, they were using swords...SWORDS! in this wonderfully hi-tech world.Violet's hair and clothes would change color randomly from time to time for no better reason than to get the 13 year old video game-addicted boys this film was obviously aimed DIRECTLY at to say to their buddies \"That's sooo coooool!\"I kept looking at the clock saying to myself \"How long has this been on? It has to be over soon,\" only to discover that another painful five minutes had passed.The suckage this film demonstrated was astonishing. I think maybe Wimmer and Boll should co-direct their next project and the suck created by the two of them together would create a black hole that they would both disappear into thereby sparing us anything even as remotely bad as this film was.minus 5 stars.

It's entertaining, doesn't dull down with too much forced and heavy handed storyline, and looks absolutely amazing. Milla did a great job (as usual) and everything about the movie was really genuinely fun. They don't push the whole \"vampire\" thing too much so as to make Violet too much like Bloodrayne or the chick from Underworld and it works a lot better than both of those movies. Aside from a few fangs here and there, you almost forget the vampire aspect of the movie. I enjoyed Aeon Flux for what it was too- and UltraViolet had a very similar feel to Aeon. The futuristic \"dipped in plastic\" metropolis with people so clean they're dirty in charge. the fight sequences were absolutely beautiful masterpieces with Milla at the center showcasing some amazing moves (very reminiscent of Equilibrium).

Some of the ideas were interesting and cool, example: The gravity belt, the look of Violet's sword, the color change, but they were executed in such a bad way. It had cheesy and I'm talking blue cheese, fight sequences. Really, why did I have to wait 5mins if not more for someone to shoot a single shot or wait forever for Violet to respond to Daxus \"Oh it's on!\" I was really hoping she would respond with \"You've got Served!\" OK I'd like to know, did they hire a bunch of college kids to do their special effects and backgrounds? They tried too hard to cover the quality by blurring the crap out of shoots. Milla did do a good job of acting and playing her part. Next time if your going to start and end a movie with telling people that you live in a world we may not understand, then for our sake tell us what is so damn hard to understand. Humans and vampires in the future fighting to kill each other but wait now we have to infect humans because vampire are becoming extinct. Why do they have to be vampires again? Why not just make them zombies or even better the chupacabra. Make this a movie rental.",

            "content": "Fantastic Film!!! Beautiful art direction and stunning visuals, Milla is wonderful for her excellent, unique acting abilities; deep emotions swim under a cool exterior - part of Milla's trademark style but delivered here with absolute precision and total humanity. William Fichtner also has a great but understated role in this as a scientist living in a mobile trailer that expands into a voluminous laboratory due to the 'flat space' technology of the times, another fantastic metaphor extended throughout the movie with incredible beauty and humor. Milla has a lot of cool things to say about this (and the architecture) in the film's commentary section. The film is visually the most elegant and stunning I have seen, largely due to the crispness of execution and the subtle intelligence of art design and choreography utilized throughout - the scenery and style of the movie are a \"vision\" - and the actors seamlessly make themselves part of this world. It is a very graceful yet cutting movie that packs quite a graphic punch but is also willing to explore great storytelling and is often highly poetic in dialogue and theme \u0096 half the story is interwoven in the visual narrative \u0096 so if you are not careful, some of the delicate nuances of this film can fly straight over your head. So do not underestimate this film or the story! Its sparseness of design and execution are part of what makes it wonderful. As an artist or photographer I think one could appreciate how every still from this film would make an attractive canvas or print. Visually it is just superb! The DVD also has some very interesting special features about the filming locations etc... All in all - riveting plot for a sci-fi - full of depth and humor and cool ideas. The story line was rich and sharply executed, not laden down by excess and useless dialogue like so many films \u0096 but minimalist yet powerful and understated dialogue, where every word counts (like a haiku) \u0096 this movie is light and graceful yet full of substance, and the fight scenes were awesome! If you don't \"get\" this movie, don't write it off \u0096 watch it again and come around!",

            "content": "1st watched 12/11/2008 \u0096 (Dir-Kurt Wimmer): So-so futuristic action movie with Milla Jojovovich playing the female tough character this time. The storyline is that there is a battle between mutant vampire-like creatures and the regular humans that have not been infected. Jovovovich's character, violet or \"v\" for short, is sort of a courier(aka. Terrorist) for her vampire group and is introduced to a boy housed in a suitcase that was supposed to be a bomb. This boy is supposedly holding an anti-virus in his bloodstream that could cure all the vampires so she basically protects him for everyone who wants to kill him. The basic plot is very similar to other tough girl movies like Terminator and others where the tough woman character really has a heart that eventually comes out. Milla is OK as the action hero character, that appears to have been based on an Asian comic book character, but there really isn't much new here. OK, so some of the action scenes are kind of cool, and she gets to change her hair & clothing color at what appears to be random times giving her a large wardrobe out of one piece of clothing but that's about it. The evil character(which ends up being the human father of the child) is very forgettable, which I guess is why I can't remember even what he looks like shortly after watching it. So, overall, this was a very blah movie, with a who-cares plot and a nothing really matters ending. I guess I didn't like it\u0085can you tell??",

            "content": "{movie gets a 7, because Milla IS the movie, anyway. Milla herself is not a Ten, but an Eleven, no, an Eleven + ... And I'm sure everybody will agree}I saw the trailer some time ago. Wow, I saw, I wanted. Just for the hell of it, read some reviews, and was dismayed to find that most people didn't like it, that, summed up, the trailer's the best thing about it. I looked at the trailer again with different eyes and spotted lots of warning signs. Yes, a bunch of drawings, computer animations. Movie is most likely going to be not much more, one hell of a disappointment. But, I do collect, after all, and it's Milla Jovovich, the little kid in TWO MOON JUNCTION I had predicted would one day be a star, and then she grew up (delightfully, ever so delightfully, pardon my slavering, I'm only a guy) and was in RETURN TO THE BLUE LAGOON, so, I got me this one, to check out for myself.I'm glad I did.Currently, 4.4? People, come on! It's supposed to look like a graphic novel come to life, with this dazzling heroine, and Milla, bless her cute little heart, fits the bill wonderfully.She's bright and bubbly (and incidentally, I generally hate commentary tracks, but her commentary on the DVD is fun) and then, of course, she is long- limbed and has those wonderful eyes and the glossy hair. Okay, just learned it's a wig. Never mind. I'm talking on-screen presence. Now THAT'S a fantasy heroine. The movie might be in a lesser class than UNDERWORLD and Milla's RESIDENT EVIL, but if there's an IMDb poll where I have to choose the prettiest kick-ass action girl, ULTRAVIOLET would be the main contender. Did I mention those angel eyes and the raven hair with the halo and that the length of those legs measured with a matchstick... Okay, I'll shut up now. Sorry. Like I said, I'm only a guy.What's up with all the religious iconography, the cross motifs? Once they start, they're everywhere, that large building seen from the sky, at the end of corridors...Good idea: Nazi Germany coal-scuttle helmet soldiers wearing gas masks, and later STAR WARS Imperial Stormtroopers, are the very symbol of Fascist oppression. Bad acting: Cameron Bright as Six. Should have been rather a little girl. Like Milla back at the start of her career. Six looked autistic. Six was absolutely sluggish and no fun, not worth the story arc bother, brought the movie down. So too that Nerva guy, had the look, but couldn't act.To sum it up though: The notion that the trailer is better than the movie itself: Well, that has SOME merit, 'cause it's a helluva good- looking trailer. But for Milla fans, for fans of drop dead gorgeous actresses: You need to see this!If you'd go into the movie with a sense of humor, it is a whole lot of entertainment. Okay, the special effects is a lot of drawings, but Milla's not a drawing, and the movie works out a lot better than I expected. Ooh, of course, had it been somebody less attractive in the lead, I'd not have bothered in the first place. But it's model-perfect Milla. Yaaayyy!",

            "content": "With the overly saturated usage of CGI animation, \"Ultraviolet\" could potentially pass off as sequel to the 1982 classic, \"Tron.\" It's quite obvious as to why Milla Jovovich was intrigued to star in this vehicle. All she had to do was simply abide through green screen and voila! There was really nothing to it. And I mean that in a literal sense. There was really nothing to it except lots of violence and over excessive CGI. I can be more entertained getting out my Playstation and feel more of a sense of seeing anything meaningful than to sit though this movie again which in this case is highly unlikely.At first glance, the lively animation looks very awesome, but then they rapidly start to wear out its welcome to the point where it begins to be overwhelmingly aggravating. By the first five minutes it becomes clear that the movie was clearly intended for two types of audience members: one for the fans of the science-fiction genre and the second for those who have short attention spans. Jovovich stars as Violet who has an illness called hemoglophagia which gives her super human strength which makes a hemophage who must protect a boy names Six (Cameron Bright) as she goes into battle against strange humanoid minions led by the evil Ferdinand Daxus (Nick Chinlund) who seem to wear weird looking salt shaker tubes up their nostrils. Even though it pans off as a simple and by-the-numbers sci-fi action film, \"Ultraviolet\" has a reputation of being both complex when it really shouldn't and very repetitive in its action scenes. And while Violet looks sexy in her leather-clad apparel and her Veronica Lodge hairdo, we have to truly care about the characters both heroes and villains to get a better understanding of them to really invest into this movie. In the nearly 90 minute film, Violet in green-screen glory, is battling Daxus' hordes of minions who look tough and menacing from eye reach, but then thy just stand there like numbskulls and wind up getting decapitated. Where's the challenge? Because of its PG-13 rating, we don't see any bloodshed. Unless it was from a distance so that the kids watching won't run from the theaters. It must've been a hefty budget to make this movie due to the amount of special effects utilized. If that's not enough, writer/director Kurt Wimmer hires a greener than an evergreen young thespian like Cameron Bright, who seems dazed and expressionless the whole time through. I often wondered if this Six character was a human or a cyborg? In the end what difference does it make?For Wimmer there was very little in scripting to even care what was happening. There are some shades of \"Minority Report\" touches in this dystopian society all the video game come-to-life action emanates. In this world there only appears to be three occupations you can pursue: either an evil corrupt corporate executive, a scientist, or an enforcer. Sure that may sound simple, but the dialogue unashamedly is anything but. There's a plethora of high-tech incoherent gibbering about antigens, antidotes and little manifestations that if you take their whole diatribe seriously and try to make sense of it, you will likely give yourself a migraine. It tries to have that same aura as that of \"The Matrix\", but it's nowhere near that classic film series. The first fifteen minutes were very captivating, but after a while, it just gets done to death and all the originality gets drained out making the movie quite uneventful. You have a platoon full of baddies surrounding Violet and with her powerful sword annihilates them in one swipe or a few shots of gunfire. I'm guessing, being an enforcer is the hardest job there is.The ending is very convoluted as were invited to a flaming sword battle taking place in the dark which feels like there's a bit of \"Highlander\" going for it only less exciting and dramatic. In spite of the film gratuitous violence and coarse language, \"Ultraviolet\" is anything but an eventful night out for anyone. Between the overdone action sequences and the over abundance of CGI and very little character development, this movie has every chance of winning the Oscars as Wimpy from Popeye's gives up hamburgers.",

Apart from a few brief moments, the fight scenes are spoilt by the director apparently trying to outdo fights from movies that were themselves already over-the-top to the point of silliness.CGI - a Sci-Fi channel TV-movie with a budget of less than $1 million might be relatively pleased with this standard of CGI, but not a movie with a supposed $30 million budget. How did this happen?The movie has a heavily filtered appearance, everything is kind of artificially hued and softened. I guess this was either an attempt to give it a comic book feel, or generally lend it a sense of unreality, the better for us to accept the unlikely occurrences in the movie. Either way, it didn't work, it just looks bad. Hard to pull much positive from this. Milla looks good, and makes about as much of her role as is possible. The storyline isn't as confusing as many other IMDb reviewers seem to be suggesting (they were probably distracted by the bad CGI and other silliness, and stopped paying attention - understandable), and with the right treatment, could have been the basis for a decent movie.

Thumbs down on how it was presented, even if the subject matter was nothing spectacular.The action, the one thing I wanted to see in this movie, was very poorly done, and boring.

If you saw Equilibrium or the Matrix and crave for more action then this is what you have been looking for. Some scenes where they mixed 3d graphics and real life look a little cheesy, but the cool moves are worth overlooking those quirks. The story line is a little too predictable but hey as I said before this was made for action not for plot. Don't watch this if you are some little nit picky touchy-feely English major. But if you want some cool action scenes (which 70%-80% of the movie is made up of) then you should rent it. Plus it has Milla Jovovich (she is one of my favorite actresses).",

I was at no point bored during this movie, and it is another sci/fi action movie that I will gladly add to my list of favorite movies.

There are nights when a 3 & 1/2 hour treatise on the sociological implications of man realizing his Super Id amid the shackles of a defeatist human logic as seen through the eyes of a Ukranian milk man is just the thing.

The plot gets left by the wayside and they go for lots of action and fighting which really doesn't help the film very much.Yes, Milla looks excellent in her various costumes which change colour on her as she wears them. The buildings and backdrops look stunning. You can tell that the fight scenes were made to look so fast by over-cranking the camera to get the illusion of more speed.Sadly the film suffers from being over-cut. The DVD contains an alternate start (much better than the one used in the film) and several cut scenes (which I would have included in my version, I assume they were cut for pacing reasons) and some extended versions of already existing scenes (which were improvements on the actual scenes themselves).This film promised a lot, and delivered a little. Milla gives a really bad DVD commentary, saying nothing for most of the movie. Not saying much when she does speak. The extra features are nothing special either.Generally a disappointing film.Try Jet Li in \"Fearless\", that was miles better than this.",

Anyone that attends a movie sporting a poster like Ultraviolet and expects believable characters, an intriguing plot and world class acting is a bit of a fool. In my experience, those scantily clad action babes with big swords aren't really famous for their Shakespearian dialogs. However, I think the reason why this one really sank like the proverbial turd in the swimming pool is that the director trusted Milla's looks to disguise the fact that there isn't really anything remotely coherent or interesting going on here. Well, maybe he managed to lure enough folks into the cinema before word got out what a mess this is.What I find slightly irritating is that with just a little bit of effort, this could have been at least bearable. So Wimmer has the star, he has the computers, he has the money and all he can come up with is this half baked demo of fight scenes that look as if something went wrong during the editing, i.e. as if they used only the footage that was supposed to be deleted. There are so many awful things about this movie that it's impossible to list them all and hard to pick the worst scene. One of the absolute low points is undoubtedly the bike chase. You can't help but ask yourself why anyone bothered. I mean, during the test screening someone must have had the guts to stand up an let the producers know how utterly boring and pointless this is. Frankly, you suspect that the producers had nodded of at this point already, otherwise they would have canned the project there and then. Personally, I think it would have been so much more exciting (mind you it would be impossible to have it less exciting) to have Milla simply jog down the block with a villain or two in hot pursuit. Instead you get Milla on a bike in cyberspace, some inept gunmen inside two choppers that fail to miss Milla with such precision that you can't help but feel cheated. Half the time the image screams 'blue screen' at you and at other times you simply want to fast forward cause if there is one thing worse here than the rather boring action scenes, its the utterly laughable dialog in between. Right at the beginning Milla introduces herself with 'My name is Violet and I was born into a world you may not understand.' Spot on you think a little later, as this movie fails to make any sense whatsoever. The only thing you actually understand is that in the highly unlikely event that our society deteriorates into anything remotely resembling the world of Ultraviolet, becoming a guard is not a very wise career move.",

I do understand that they were going for a comic book theme here, but it just didn't translate well onto film.A lot of people have complained there was no plot. Well, there was, sort of. But it was pretty stupid and it seemed to completely fall apart at the end. The ending was really kind of confusing. It just made no sense. Is the kid now a vampire? Is Violet still dying?

            "content": "Kurt Wimmer virtually created a new genre with \"Equilibrium\". Following up that cult classic was always going to be difficult but when Ultraviolet was announced, expectations were understandably high. As it turns out, Ultraviolet falls considerably short of the high standard set by \"Equilibrium\". However, this film is by no means the train wreck that it has been portrayed to be. Ultraviolet may be a mess but it still offers more dizzying imagery and computer magic than most blockbusters with three times its budget.The single biggest problem with Ultraviolet is the story, or lack thereof. A longwinded preamble talks about plagues and diseases, which have resulted in a large portion of the population becoming hemophages - a kind of inoffensive vampire. The government's response to the crisis was initially to treat, then simply to eradicate the hemophages. This was the fate that befell Violet, who escaped a vampire concentration camp to become a vigilante. Despite the fact that Violet never looks or behaves like a vampire and the film forgets to explain Violet's inexplicable fighting prowess - so far so good. In fact the film begins in spectacular style as Violet breaks into a laboratory and steals a case, overcoming a virtual army of guards and scientists. The film begins to fall apart at the seams when Violet finds a human child inside the case and decides to protect it at all costs. Her actions are at odds with everything the character stands for and Violet appears to think nothing of betraying her colleagues.The rest of the film is basically one long chase scene as Violet struggles to protect the child, known as \"Six\" from the humans and her fellow mutants. Ultraviolet is never boring, fight after unrealistic fight takes place, characters come and go, flashbacks show glimpses into Violet's old life but nothing really makes any sense or is even vaguely plausible. \"Equilibrium\" managed to create a sense of gravity through its own convincing mythology. Ultraviolet, on the other hand, is about as deep as Paris Hilton.If you can get past the fact that the film is basically an excuse to show off Wimmer's computer trickery, Ultraviolet is an enjoyable experience. The action sequences are disappointingly soft as far as violence is concerned but the martial arts and shootings are innovatively staged. There is a tendency to give every fight scene a \"Matrix\" makeover, with balletic martial arts moves and the requisite bullet dodging, but there are enough new ideas on display to give the film its own identity. The human ball bearings that open the film is one example of Kurt Wimmer's wonderful imagination, Violet's climactic fight against an entire army is another.In the midst of all this action are a couple of nice scenes between Violet and Six. Milla Jovovich is surprisingly effective as the title character and has to be the best supermodel turned action hero in the history of cinema. Violet is more than a rehash of Milla's character in the far superior \"Resident Evil\" films. Violet's actions might not make much sense but Milla somehow manages to stop her from coming across as a complete lunatic. The only other actor worth mentioning is Nick Chinlund as Vicecardinum Daxus. Chinlund gives an enjoyably extravagant performance and he makes a good foil for Milla's subtle take on Violet.Ultraviolet, like \"Equilibrium\", is distinguished by its innovative use of computer graphics and stylish set and costume design. Kurt Wimmer does not simply utilise computer graphics for special effects sequences, he uses them to create the film's tone, style and landscape. As such, Wimmer's films occupy a weird and wonderful place between live action and computer animation. The jarring factor for the uninitiated is that this director is not aiming for science fiction realism but a highly stylised fantasy world. It must be said that this approach was far better suited to the darker \"Equilibrium\". The candy coloured world that serves as the backdrop for Ultraviolet often robs the film of its edge and contributes to the film's lack of gravity.The theatrical version of the film appears to be a studio hatchet job. Apparently, there is at least half an hour of additional footage floating around. I hope that Kurt Wimmer one day gets the opportunity to release a revised version of the film. I suspect that the released product differs substantially from his original vision.",

You got humans fighting vampires, and though it's called a \"blood war\" it's actually just the last remaining, say, five vampires against the rest of humanity. Violet gets caught between lines, protecting a cloned human child that maybe carries the cure for vampirism. So far, so good, there's a lot of action going on and a lot of it is CGI, some of it good, some of it not. The (virtual) sets all look pretty good, and there are some nice shots here, especially the objective shots of preparation and aftermath of the (many) fight scenes. I don't know if this movie has a message, if so, it doesn't quite come across, it's just a well made action flick with a dumb story, a lot of cool over-the-top ideas, especially when it comes to fighting, and okay acting. Compared to its direct competitor, Aeon Flux, it's way better.",

            "content": "Where to begin? If you're reading my comment you probably want to have the bad reviews you've been hearing clarified in one way or another by a human being instead of the lifeless sacks of sawdust that get paid to write their droll and unfair reviews. Ultraviolet is something of a spiderweb of confusion for me. usually I'm good at finding out why a movie is good or bad. this movie is NOT one of them. It took me awhile to figure out why Ultraviolet (although full of potential and cool on its own terms) left me desiring more, so I compiled a list of things this movie needed to make it more interesting; characters: I think a bit of normality was needed so that the watcher would feel more comfortable. I felt a little awkward because I wanted to know the characters but just couldn't seem to care for lack of involvement. the lighting/coloring/hues: the blurred look/and or the bright colors made it hard to concentrate or believe what I was watching, although I realize this could've been added to make it seem more comic-bookish, I'm convinced it would've been better without it. the fight scenes: I would have liked to see violet get a bit hurt to better show her humanity, but besides her illness she appears to have no real rival throughout the whole film, not even the main badguy. the music: not all bad, but in at least one point it was completely offbeat and mindnumbing. repetition: there were a few lines, action scenes and scenarios that were just a bit too reminiscent of equilibrium or even other parts of the movie to be taken seriously. I can understand shoddy CGI, I don't blame them, but the brightness made it all the more visible. the badguys weren't as hateable as you would hope. Stupid, ugly, mean, worthy of extermination, semi-formidable, weird and gross, but hateable? not really, not to the point of inner satisfaction when they died. love interest: well I think what they put in was really sweet, but hell a kiss would've made it even cuter, especially since nothing was resolved. I think they could've talked more about the past and its descent into the futuristic world we're introduced to at the beginning of the movie a bit more than they did, which as I mentioned before makes the viewer feel strongly alienated. and then of course there's the muddled plot line, not a bad plot, not bad acting, but when it's over the viewer feels a sense of detachment, like...you watched it but it never taught you anything, it didn't touch your emotions, we always know the hero wins but it was like watching someone play a game with unlimited ammo, level skip and god-mode on, all at once. It's lacking in what makes games so much fun: the story, and the challenge. So IMHO, an eight, I liked this movie because I liked equilibrium, I like Kurt Wimmer, I like Milla Jovovich, I like the style, the action, the costumes and the character's originality despite what anyone says. I really hope to one day see a Director's Cut. I know it may not come full circle, but I think it deserves the chance.",

            "content": "I recognised the title, and I remember seeing an image or the DVD cover or poster with the leading actress, I guess I just wanted to see it because of her, from director Kurt Wimmer (Equilibrium). Basically, set in the late 21st Century, the year 2078, a disease created by scientists called Hemophagia has spread across the world and wiped out most of the human race, and all those who were caught up in the spread have become vampire-like creatures. Caught in the middle of the devastation is infected warrior Violet (Milla Jovovich), working for an underground resistance, who steals a weapon developed to exterminate all Hemophages. She claims that she hates humans, and she is surprised to see that the weapon is a nine year old boy, the clone of Daxus (Nick Chinlund), his name is Six (Cameron Bright), he is supposedly the cure for the disease. Daxus reveals that Six's blood is actually deadly to humans, and after he refuses to give Violet the real cure he instead has Six taken for dissection. She finds out he is not dead, and she fights against loads of troops in order to get Six back, and of course killing Daxus, and in the end it is Violet's tears tears that save his life, as they get rid of the disease. Also starring S\u00e9bastien Andrieu as Nerva, William Fichtner as Garth, Ida Martin as Young Violet, David Collier as BF-1, Kieran O'Rorke as Detective Cross, Digger Mesch as Detective Endera and Ryan Martin as Detective Breeder. I have to say the only good thing about this film is the gorgeous Jovovich, with her colour changing form-hugging leather clothing and hair, her magnificent belly which is visible in almost every scene, and of course her chopping up and shooting dead loads of bad guys. Apart from that, the film is absolutely pants, the heroine is like Jovovich's previous role as AeonFlux, the story is the same sort of thing as Underworld, the theme is very similar to Resident Evil, quite a lot of the special effects look like they didn't cost much, and it just a completely nonsense story, a silly science fiction action thriller.

Motorcycle chase scenes may have been forever altered by this film's use of CGI, I will not take away your sport by telling you what happened, but be glad this not filmed in 3-D and you watched it on a full stomach! Wimmer's imagery of the evolution of both cell-phones whether post-paid or pre-paid and his take on concealed weapons is way beyond what most folk see them as being right now.The plot is very well-knit until it reaches the end, it seems he slapped on an end as he created such vivid characters that even he did not know where the next step was - this a similar problem in \"Matrix Revolutions\" which also had a conclusion I did not agree with...It is not that the story is so powerful but the fictional people have a life that exceeds the dimensions where they are captured and therefore you are not truly sure where the finish will be only that our conclusion is briefer than their true literary or silver-screen lifespan! The supporting characters are definitely larger than \"life\" - Garth as the vampire who learned to feel again, the boy Six who seemed retarded but was more than he appeared and who can forget Vice-Cardinal Daxus, who's worthy of standing alongside Lex Luthor or Darth Vader.His soldiers bore some resemblance to the Lord of the Sith as well, Wimmer borrowed from \"Blade,\" \"Equilibrium\" and \"Matrix\" but still had a world all his very own.

            "content": "A number of spectators may have chosen to see Ultraviolet because of Kurt Wimmer's previous Equilibrium which while it wasn't quite there yet was still good and promising. Wimmer claimed that he did in Ultraviolet (with a much larger budget) what he had sketched out in Equilibrium.I was one of those spectators. While it didn't have a completely ground shattering story line (but then what movie does), Equilibrium did have a number of interesting cinematographic ideas. Unfortunately it was released roughly at the same time as the first Matrix movie (also sort of in the \"acrobatic gunfight\" genre) and was pretty much lost in the noise. However those of us who saw it remembered to keep an eye for that director who showed some promise.Then came Ultraviolet. Where Kurt Wimmer finally got to do what he wanted to. But somewhere, something went wrong.Because I am at heart an optimist, I still kind of believe that most of the damage was done in the cutting room. Film editing is a bit of a black art and it's amazing how much you can destroy (or mend for that matter) on the editing bench. In this case, the editing software must have been very buggy, the editor very drunk, or someone must have come at night and purposefully destroyed the movie. At any rate the structure of the movie is just terrible. It doesn't flow, the story (what little of it there is) doesn't work, a lot of the scenes feel broken. Even some of the action scenes don't work properly.All of this makes the film quite painful to watch, especially because you keep thinking of the lot opportunities. Oh and for some reason a soft filter is applied on every single close shot of Milla Jovovich (who must have shot this at the ripe age of 29 or 30). This was very distracting for me.In conclusion, and despite the fairly negative comments above, the film is full of interesting little ideas that people who are interested in modern cinematography will enjoy picking out and analyse (hence the 4 I gave). As a movie for the generic public though, it's probably better to do something else at the same time.But honestly, to get this end product, someone must have sabotaged the film. It just doesn't make sense any other way.",

So obviously this was a match made in heaven for me, right? Good god was I wrong. I was having a hard time keeping up with the story, if I can even be called that (I'd like to think it was more like a drug-induced hallucination, but whatever) - mainly because I was blinded by the terribly clashing colors - and about 8 minutes in I decided that this movie was probably not going to get any better. I'd like to congratulate myself for being so right. So OK, the movie's kinda bad, let's just keep watching I told myself. The deal breaker for me came when she opened up that case and we got to witness the worst f'ing rendering of CG EVER. There had to be SOME way to better convey the idea that the creepy kid from Birth was in that case. I mean, what was that plasma he was floating in? Oh my god I was too through with the movie after that.The dialogue in Ultraviolet makes Star Wars Episode III's dialogue sound like an intellectual exchange between mental juggernauts. The action scenes COULD have been somewhat cool, you know, if the people actually tried to fight. V just rolls in, swings some blade around and 63 people drop to the ground. And is the changing hair color ever explained or are we just supposed to assume that's normal?I wanted to cry for the time and money and brainpower and electricity and water and light waves wasted on this movie.

Not only she is cute as hell, but I have the feel that she can act. Of course, with proper guidance. In this movie they changed her clothes and hair style a few times, blurred her face with CGI to the point of MichaelJacksization and let her act while the director was at lunch or sick in bed at home.Even if this movie has more heart break than a south American soap, it also has a lot of head break, chest break, leg break, hand break, let's face it, the woman breaks just about every part of the human body in this movie about (again) faceless soldiers that try to kill their victim with swords in a world where projectile weapons can just pop up in one's hand. The body count is about 1000 people, although they don't really bother to show every single kill.I really wish Milla would stick to smarter movies (or at least movies that are not completely idiotic like this one) and that this trend of comic book character films would stop or at least improve one notch.",

After all, this was written and directed by the same fellow who gave us the highly acclaimed sci-fi action-thriller 'Equilibrium.' It can't be all bad, can it? Well, maybe not \"all bad,\" but that still leaves a world full of terrible possibilities, and 'Ultraviolet' unquestionably inhabits it as much as it can.This movie endeavors mightily, with every fiber of its being, to be slick, and stylish, and cool. There are indeed thoughts herein - facets of the production, shots, action sequences, story ideas - that are wonderfully imaginative. That filmmaker Kurt Wimmer decided to include every last one of them makes this astoundingly overbearing from start to finish. That Wimmer threw in every possible notion to astound the 12-year old boys in the audience, and sacrificed substance in the process, ranges from frustrating to infuriating. The dialogue in particular is absolutely atrocious, but the scene writing and plot at large also struggle to attain cohesiveness, coherence, or a root measure of suspension of disbelief. The overabundance of intended snazzy flair is garish in and of itself, becomes more so in light of proliferate CGI (some instances of which are among the very worst I've ever seen), and makes any effort at gravity and emotional impact laughably maudlin.Part of the problem with Superman as a character is that a being who is Perfectly Good and Perfectly Powerful is Perfectly Boring. 'Ultraviolet' has much the same issue in various ways. Some action sequences are bereft of action or stakes, because the title character needs only to flick a wrist and all the enemies surrounding her fall dead; there are barely any strikes, minimal visible combat, little to no risk for our protagonist. This same sensibility carries over to the visual presentation at large. I do earnestly appreciate the contributions of crew behind the scenes - production design, art direction, costume design, hair and makeup, props and weapons, fight choreographers, stunt people, composer Klaus Badelt. It's unfortunate that all their work is painted over with a waxy sheen of flagrant bombast that washes out color and detail, amplifying by a thousandfold the feeling of heavy-handed artificiality. The result is a sense that from top to bottom, this picture was better in concept than in reality. Maybe it would have actually been bettered served as a comic book, as suggested by the opening credits, so that we could let our own imaginations fill in the blanks - for, every time 'Ultraviolet' fills in the blanks for us, it looks and sounds worse and worse.There are some worthy themes and ideas in the plot, relevant to real life. These are upended by revelations at the climax that sunder what the story had previously been building, pulling it apart at the seams. The nature of the project disallows the cast from putting in their best effort, so the performances are either dull (Milla Jovovich, Cameron Bright) or overzealous (Nick Chinlund, Sebastien Andrieu), with no middle ground. As if the painfully overwrought visuals weren't enough, the squashing of the actors robs the feature of all possible heart. No heart, no meat - just an empty shell. It's a pretty shell, but a hollow one nonetheless.It's not the worst thing I've ever seen. Yet I'm astounded at the choices that were made, so emphatically overloading on zip, zest, and pizzazz without any of the meaningfulness to accompany it. There was potential here, but sadly Wimmer seems to have opted for fashion over function, so that potential is left at best unused, or possibly abused. I'm glad for those who find this more entertaining than I did. I regret spending ninety minutes on 'Ultraviolet,' and I feel bad for those involved.",

However, I really don't know why people hate this movie so much. I think it's similar to why a lot of people didn't like Hulk, in that people had a hard time accepting what was in the movie. In this movie you have to accept that it's far in the future and they have a lot of super-duper high tech gizmo's. For example (from the trailers) Violet wears an outfit that can change color, plus her hair color and sunglasses can change color.Another problem people had with this movie is the CGI. When it comes to CGI I compare this movie to Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. In that movie the CGI that you see was meant to be that way. It wasn't poor CGI anymore then you'd call Finding Nemo bad CGI since they didn't quite look like fish. And like Finding Nemo I'm sure this movie could have looked more realistic, but I don't think they were going for that. I think they were kind of going for like a semi-surreal feeling for the movie.Overall I think this is a kick-butt sci-fi action movie. With vampires... and Martial Arts.If you like far-future science-fiction you should like this movie.Now for a couple of my favorite things/scenes in this movie.******** *********** ********SPOILERS!!!******* ************ **********The gadgets. There are 2 technologies that I think were really well done (but very far-fetched...which is OK).First is what they call \"flat space tech.\" Basically this (for one) allows her to keep an arsenal on her body. I think how it works is it basically reduces things to like a microscopic level and you wear like a bracelet that \"forms\" the item that you downloaded. So you DL the plan and materials for a sword then when your out walking the street and your attacked you can form a sword in like 2 seconds. Anyway, I like that and the ways they used it.Second is really only used in the beginning but it's really awesome, and that is what they call a \"gravity leveler.\" The way I figure this works is that down is wherever your feet (or wheels) are pointed. So if you flip in the air and point your feet at the ceiling and your standing on the ceiling. They use this frequently in the early part of the movie but unfortunately after the chase scene it's not used much (only once more and only for a short bit).Which leads me to my favorite scene of the movie. The chase scene. This is IMO the best sci-fi chase scene of all time. She's on a motorcycle and she uses the gravity leveler to ride on the sides of the buildings. I'm not sure how long the scene is but I found it quite intense. She's being chased by two attack helicopters and most of the buildings she's riding on have a lot of glass so while they're shooting at her (and missing of course) there's glass falling around and in front of her. The first time I watched that scene it was so intense it took my breath away.Overall. 8/10. Great action, good CGI, great sci-fi stuff, but the dialog is silly sounding at times.",

How does a vampire do that? Plus, the only way I even figured out she was a vampire was some of the others had fangs. It's only mentioned a couple of times and they don't drink blood and have no problem going out during the day. What was the point of making them vampires? The whole disease made no sense. How come not everyone was wearing a mask. And why didn't violet wear a mask in order to blend in when she was being chased. Wouldn't that stand out saying, I already have the disease.And I didn't get how she got past security in the beginning and tricked them into thinking she was a human. Made no sense.Last, I'll comment on the action stunts. So over the top and cartoonish. It looked like a video game. Was terrible. Some how violet makes her bike fly and land in a helicopter while never being shot, yet she can blow up the copter. And why can none of the other vampires last more than 20 seconds against her in a fight.

A woman infected with a vampiric disease plans to overthrow a futuristic government before her kind are exterminated. How does she do it? Advanced martial arts, obviously! She doesn't just tackle twenty armed individuals atop an imposing needle skyscraper. Oh no, she singlehandedly wrecks an entire army of seven hundred, with just a sword and a plethora of firearms. Only director Wimmer could capture the technique of \"Gun Fu\" whilst creating a vividly imaginative dystopian environment. Alas, the film is awful. There's no escaping this entirely subjective view. Anyone who watches this will immediately feel nauseated by the obnoxious style Wimmer forces upon us. From low octane inexplicable action sequences to visual effects resembling a retro PlayStation game. The exaggerative aesthetic appeal masquerades a deceptively thin plot with minimal character development and a basic narrative structure. Action, exposition, action, exposition, final showdown, the end. The acting was bland and monotonous, aside from Jovovich who is always a pleasure to watch...and her stomach, where every single frame resembled Darude's 'Sandstorm' music video. Yet, somehow beneath my thick film critiquing skin, I succumbed to the absurdity. Motorcycling through a helicopter mid-air, flaming sword fight, constant hair and clothing colour transitions for no apparent reason, gravity belt for both herself and the motorcycle, \"3D me\" and technology so outrageously unique that my eyes glistened with delight. Possibly the weirdest film experience ever. So visually blinding, that you begin to question if the horrific style was actually on purpose. Did I really witness a hidden stylised masterpiece?

In Ultraviolet, those flaws are magnified. Like 5th Element, Jovovich has the convincing emotional range of a sack of fish. Like Equilibrium, the ridiculous contradictions inherent in the main plot make it impossible to suspend disbelief. And like the Matrix, the action is supposed to carry the show, regardless of characterization, which is almost entirely ignored).We don't know why Jovovich is fighting, and don't ultimately care. She's so good at it, thanks to sped-up, over-the-top fight choreography, that we get no sense of threat to her ever, at all, which means no tension. The evil uberboss is...well, he's lame. Badly written, badly acted, even badly dressed.Worst of all, even the action sags. In addition to the complete lack of tension, the monochrome hordes of Jovovich's enemies make it impossible to make anything out. Rather than pull back the camera, the fool of a cameraman actually closes in even further, so all we see is a swishing flap of fabric, followed by a lot of bodies hitting the floor while Jovovich poses unconvincingly, sword or gun upraised. Interesting to watch once, maybe, but not the fifteen or so times we get the treatment.Give this one a miss.",

            "content": "Ultraviolet (which I will not italicize, as that would simply lend it credibility) fails to entertain because it lacks environment, plot, dialogue, character, music, pace, climax, production value and acting.To say that the film lacks environment is an oversimplification. The film has environment; the problem is, there's no explanation of it. There's strange architecture, and there might be some kind of interesting dynamic between the various groups illustrated throughout the film. However, none of these things are explained, explicitly or implicitly, enough to make them actual, solid story elements.Along with environment goes the dreadful inclusion of such random and distressing elements as 'gravity levellers,' dimensional something-or-other technology (which is nothing more than an excuse to allow Milla to carry lots of guns, which she never uses at the right times), and that laughable gun-dance misery that turned Equlibrium into a poor excuse for a martial arts movie. Not only are these absolutely not necessary to the story, they require a suspension of disbelief which the actual plot simply does not call for.There is no plot. Well, there might kind of be something like an ongoing story, as it'd be nearly impossible to make a movie with no plot unless you were trying. The movie starts to actually explain why the main character is the main character... but abandons it in favor of something that just doesn't add anything to the story or make any sense. The story happens twice. She shoots a lot of people, gets a package, loses it, kills a lot more people, gets it back again, movie ends. There's really not much more to it than that. Oh, this occurs on a background of a virus which apparently turns people into vampires who can walk during the day, don't drink blood and... well, they're people with long teeth that apparently don't live very long, and that's it. There is no explanation for any of this. It's hard to talk about the plot without getting upset.This film lacks character interaction. There are four important characters. Two of them have about five lines apiece, one is the villain (You should've taken the money, Toombs), and one is Milla, who proves here that, given any license with her lines, she is utterly incapable of emulating actual human emotion. This is, admittedly, in large part a problem with the writing; the lines are stiff, forced, random, insubstantial and, very often, completely out of left field. At no time does the dialogue (or monologue; god how I wish I could just forget Milla's narratives) add enough to warrant watching this film without earplugs.Music... this will be brief. At only one point did the music in this film assert itself, and that was to say \"Hey, listen to this, it's loud and bassy, but isn't coming from the environment -- it's music!\" This was the low point; unfortunately, there were no high points.I sat through about five mediocre \"hm, this might be the beginning of a story\" false starts and three \"is it ending?!\" moments. The fact that I honestly could not tell whether it was ending at the first two (the third, thankfully, did not disappoint) very nearly had me in tears at the prospect of more. This movie meanders -- not so much in story as in quality, since the story never really happens -- between mediocrity and pitiful inadequacy. It can't figure out where it wants to be, and never really tries hard enough to look convincing.The lack of climax ties in nicely with the poor pace. Part of the reason it's impossible to tell if the movie is ending or not at several points is that you're never really given anything that could be called a high point or a pivotal story moment. It does become obvious about five minutes from the end that you are, indeed, near the end; however, before that point, you are wandering in the dark, just as the monkeys who wrote this must have been while searching for their typewriters. The lights obviously never came on, and they stopped far, far short of Shakespeare.The biggest complaint I'd heard before seeing this movie was about the poor CG. Yes, it was bad, but there is so, so much more to complain about that I seriously wonder how people could even look past it to see the amateurish graphics work and single it out as the movie's greatest flaw. It's not good. Ten years ago, it would have been... decent. There's just not much to say about it. Yes, it detracts from the film, but that makes it one snowflake in a raging blizzard.In Resident Evil and Fifth Element, Milla was not bad. She was not a shining light of talent, a beacon of acting magnificence, but she was convincing enough that her presence did not detract from those films. Either this is her evil twin sister usurping her fame, or Milla truly is just a terrible actress who had a few good films and some astonishingly great acting coaches (who must now be deceased, possibly by their own hands). While this movie could not possibly have been excellent, it could have been less terrible if Milla had tried a little harder to sound a bit more sincere and a little less... forced, childish, ridiculous, all of these work. Her unbelievably poor performance is probably the biggest reason this is such an undeniably terrible movie.I cannot stress enough how poor this movie is. I felt bad the first time I laughed at the screen... however, the majority of the theatre was laughing along half way through the movie (during the 'serious' scenes, mostly), and I just could not make myself stop. Most of my fellow victims clapped when it ended; they were not applauding its quality.",

Some have blamed this on a small budget and others on 30 minutes having been cut from the final version, but either way it's an undeniable truth.Still yet, Ultraviolet isn't nearly as bad as many are saying it is. The horrible reviews probably have more to do with expectations set too high then with the value of the film compared to others. It certainly isn't one of the worst films that I've seen and the creativeness with it's story and visual effects were among the best.Some have said it is unrealistic, but even though too little realism is a pet peeve of mine, I can't help but wonder what they were expecting out of a comic-book-style movie. Vampires set in a futuristic society definitely is not realistic, but it is a creative use of one's imagination and I fail to see how it's anymore unrealistic then many other popular comic-book-style movies (Superman? Batman? X-Men?). These people obviously missed something here.The visual styles were among the best I've seen anywhere. If you removed the futuristic techno music, which first appeared during the mid-80's, it was stylistically comparable to the authentic punk rock/new wave themes of the late-70's and early-80's. I'm no expert on the use of CGI, but I greatly enjoyed how it was used in Ultraviolet, unlike many critics who thought there it was used too much or too poorly. The creativity of the visual styles and story line alone are enough to warrant a rating better then that of a middle-of-the-road movie.Although I told you that too little realism is a pet peeve of mine, too little creativity is another one that I have. I would rebut critics who think this film was too unrealistic by saying that too many recent sci-fi movies lack creativity (in fact, this is a problem we see everywhere these days and it's probably the result of living in a society that has become a little too structured and orderly, ala \"1984\".) Specifically speaking, it's not the stories that lack creativity these days, but their presentation and how most of them attempt to copy the visual style of only a handful of other popular sci-fi movies (i.e. Alien, Star Wars, Blade Runner, The Matrix, etc.) Ultraviolet deserves credit for not falling into this trap.Having spent much time defending Ultraviolet, I have to say that much of the criticism is spot on and there are few other positive things that can be said about Ultraviolet. It certainly could have been a better movie. Regardless, I still enjoyed it enough to give it 7/10, and while that may be a little generous, Ultraviolet is certainly a better then average movie.",

Unlike Kurt Wimmer's previous effort, Equilibrium, there didn't seem to be much point to this movie other than showing off Milla Jovovich's abs.Don't get me wrong: Milla Jonovich has great abs and if all you wanted to see was those abs then you'll get your money's worth and then some. It did seem as though every shot of Milla Jonovich was really her -or possibly a stunt double- and not just some CGI version of a scantally clad woman a la Catwoman.No, the problem, as I've said already, is that there didn't seem to be any point to all this. Please don't accuse me of not paying attention: the problem is I paid too much attention. In the end, the movie doesn't deliver anything in the way of clear motivations for any of the major characters: the Vice-Cardinal turns out to be evil for no other reason than simply be evil. You can't blame it all on bigotry given what we learn in the final act of the movie. Thus, the movie tries to pass off as a clever movie with a twist but instead turns out to be a silly movie that makes little sense.I have an even harder time trying to figger out Violet's motivations. Here we have the main character in the movie who kills friends and foes with equal nonchalance. I guess they are all bad people and they all deserve to die. Oh if only the real world had the logic of a bad action movie then we could all be serial killers and not have to worry about morality.Yes, I know Violet trying to protect a child. This is a child who is going to die. She herself is going to die. Granted, the movie ends with the child surviving and offering to cure her. But she doesn't know anything about the child half way through the movie other than the fact that he is dying. Indeed, she has every reason to think the child is a retard (sorry... mentally challenged individual) who can't even speak.Not only can the child speak but he's very articulate. Not only is he articulate but he's a genius who knows how to cure vampirism. So why wait until the final act to tell Violet this? Why does he really on his over abundance of cuteness as the only way to get Violet to save him? This is a woman who just killed thirty of her friends without so much as blinking (although, granted, technically all she did was dodge bullets). He needed to provide a better reason for wanting to keep him around. She even decided to abandon him at one point and he just said \"Goodbye\". Why didn't he say \"Don't let them take me and turn me into a weapon! Oh and, by the way, I can cure you.\" Three major characters. Three characters with no clear motivations. That's three for three.Actually, there is one character who has clear motivations and that is he doctor/friend played by William Fichtner. She asked him \"Why did you go to all this trouble?\" and he says \"Isn't it obvious?\" (meaning \"I want to get into your pants\"). Unfortunately, Violet isn't the brightest psychopath on the planet. I wouldn't be so quick to assume that anything came as obvious to her.Martin",

Milla did nothing particularly attractive or revealing. Worse, the color scheme and CGI did much to prevent me from seeing details of anything.

This being the case, you would think there would have been an introduction of some sort.Plot - Who are the good guys and who are the bad guys? The question is more like who are the worst of the bad guys? Something to do with a disease that turns people into vampires (these vampires don't seem to bite people and aren't afraid of the sun)and the government is trying to kill all of them. Anyway, the \"hero\" finds a boy in a plastic backpack that has a disease that will kill all vampires, or will kill all humans, or will cure all vampires (I'm so confused) and the government wants the boy back.Characters - Um, what characters? Other than Ultraviolet and the government baddie, there's nobody else. The boy? You could have substituted a bag of potatoes and it would have been a better casting.Special effects - CGI, CGI, CGI. The entire movie is CGI. Every close-up shot of Milla Jovovich looks like she's in a dream sequence. While CGI is getting better and better, the CGI in this movie looks like something Pixar would do in an animated movie for Disney.Summary - Did I mention this movie is terrible? No story, no plot, no characters, just CGI action. Don't see it unless you fancy seeing Milla Jovovich's bare midriff for 90 minutes.It was just plain silly. Case in point, most of the vampires live in the same building with organized crime gangsters. What prevented the government from storming the building years earlier and wiping everyone out? The Ultraviolet character was completely invulnerable, killing everyone who crossed her path (over a thousand guards at one point). The final battle with the main baddie boss was completely unsatisfying. Normally the hero is the underdog in the last fight and has to rise from the brink of death to defeat the main baddie boss.

            "content": "Since Resident Evil (2002) came out, Milla Jovovich has gained a reputation for being cast in female action leads. Because of that, it is not much of a surprise to see her as a blade / gun wielding vampire either. I am actually more surprised how audiences and critics alike do not favor this over the Twilight series. Many people consider this, because of that specific franchise, vampires have become an extremely tired genre. But in this movie, it was the exact opposite of what one would expect from a vampire movie. I will admit it is not the strongest in its genre but I'm sure people would favor it now than when it came out.Jovovich plays Violet, once a human that became a hemophage (a type of vampire) after becoming infected by a contagious virus that got out of control. At the time she was infected, she was also pregnant and ended up having her unborn child die. Since then, she has called it upon herself to kill any human that fights her and the rest of the hemophages that stand behind her. Supplying her with weapons is her friend Garth (William Fichtner). The villain, Ferdinand Daxus, is played by Nick Chinlund and although he doesn't come across as menacing at all, he is rather comical because of his unintentional deadpan acting. However I did not understand that \"thing\" in his nose. What is the point of that? To prevent him from wearing a face mask?As listed above, these three actors are really all that is note worthy of a mention. Every other character that has more than 30 seconds on screen are just lambs to the slaughter of Jovovich. The film was written and directed by Kurt Wimmer, a decent advocate of the film industry. He also wrote for Law Abiding Citizen (2009), Salt (2010) and others, which have received positive recognition. So why he couldn't conjure up as great a product here? More than likely it was due to the film being cut back so much in running time and writing and directing is not the easiest thing to do simultaneously; especially film making. The story doesn't go into much depth, which can end up leaving audiences either confused or bored.As for everything else, the set design looked cool for a futuristic piece. I was surprised however to see various parts of the movie look like it was completely CGI. I think by 2006, that kind of problem could be fixed easily. As for the rest, I did like the special effects; they seemed to blend in well with their surroundings. What really got points for this movie was the action. Going back to what I said before, Jovovich is action oriented and the way she performs doing her stunts is awesome no matter what else has happened. Lastly, Klaus Badelt's score was uneven. It had more sentimental tracks than it did pertaining to the action scenes. It's not to say it didn't carry any emotion but the action scenes lacked thrills because the music wasn't effective.Kurt Wimmer's adaptation of this comic book vampire isn't the strongest in its genre but its action pieces are well set up. And although it does not have an all star cast, the actors play their roles the best they can.",

            "content": "The opening credits are perhaps the best part of this movie. They use a comic book format, as if \"Ultraviolet\" is a movie version of a comic book. But it isn't. I suspect they were trying to ride on the coattails of other comic book movies like 'Spiderman', 'XMen', and others.I like Milla Jovovich even though she isn't a particularly good actress, but was perfect for her roles in 'Messenger' and 'Fifth Element'. But her voice isn't right for the type of role she plays here. It sort of sounds like Sherilynn Fenn, with a slight foreign lilt to it. But she is very nice to look at, and that to me is the main appeal of the movie. Seeing Milla Jovovich in various costumes and in action, kicking butt as a mutant fighting for the underdogs in this far future version of Earth where the fear of terrorists has been replaced by the fear of pathogens in the air.Jovovich is Violet Song jat Shariff, often called 'V', but we see her as Ultraviolet, unstoppable fighting and killing machine. Here nemesis is played by Nick Chinlund, who as Vicecardinum Ferdinand Daxus rules the healthy portion of the population. As the movie begins we see 'V' showing up as a messenger (no pun) in disguise to steal a case which contains a powerful weapon. When the real messenger shows up 15 minutes later, all hell breaks loose and we first see what a fighting machine 'V' is.The simple story line makes sense, but it isn't a particularly good one. When it is over I didn't feel that the story came together in a meaningful way. As one critic observed, it is much like watching someone play a video game, but not being able to participate.SPOILERS. Young Cameron Bright plays 'Six', because he is the 6th clone of Daxus. When 'V' opens the mysterious white case after she steals in the beginning of the movie, young Six is inside. Somehow he has the antibodies to make all the sick people normal. So the main of the movie is Daxus' men trying to retrieve, or kill, young Six. The movie is a series of thinly connected fight scenes, highly computerized. 'V' always prevails!!",

But you know what, I'm getting really, really sick and tired of hearing \"Oh, this was such a horrible movie. Don't go see it.\" My opinion: You're all a bunch of uptight jerks. I admit, the movie had some cheesy moments, the plot got a little confusing at times, and it progressed a little slow sometimes. But at least I will get past all of that in order to enjoy the movie for what it really is. A good action movie with a good plot, some interesting twists, cool action scenes, and a couple of cute moments. I also admit that a lot people have their own opinions about what a good movie is, whether it be action, drama, comedy, or whatever. But a lot of the professional critics out there call a lot of movies either mediocre or bad. I'm not saying that you shouldn't listen or read what people who don't like this movie say about it. I'm just saying that like with all movies, you should go see it for yourself and make your own opinion. I did, and I don't regret it. My point is, this movie, in my opinion, is not as bad as people say it is. But again, just go see it for yourself so that you can actually have an accurate and honest opinion about it, whether you bash it or not after you do see it. Please.",

What the hell were the people involved in this film thinking? Did they mean for it to turn out like this? I am actually angry that this movie was produced, and that we were fooled into believing that it would be a good movie by previews. I am now going to go watch Jean-Claude Van Damme kick the crap out of some baddies to try to forget what the hell I just saw.

            "content": "Tongue in cheek pure action no-brainers aren't what they used to be. I think the addition of excessive CGI is what has lead to their downfall, at least that seems to be in evidence here.It came off as something about on Par with Batman and Robin. It made me wonder what it'd be like if they made an A-Team movie with a tonne of CGI thrown in. It also made me wish I hadn't bother seeing it.I couldn't help but think the film could have been a lot better. The premise (what there was of one) wasn't too bad and Jovovich was a perfectly reasonable choice to star. I remember seeing the trailer and thinking it looked better then the Aeon Flux trailer (which turned out to be a much better film BTW). But aside from the source material and the leading lady everything about this film was wrong.The dialogue is all over the place. Sometimes attempting to be serious, sometimes overly tongue in cheek and whenever someone says a kind of cool tongue in cheek line, it's followed up by something that ruins it. The action too is like someone with very few ideas decided to make up for it by repeating ab-nauseum. The plot could have been written on the back of a bus ticket, the editing is also pretty shabby and the flow of the film is kind of disjointed all the way because of it. Indeed the lighting, camera work and CGI itself are all pretty second rate.Finally, this film has perhaps the worst soundtrack I've heard in a film. The music chosen for tense scenes and action scenes work about as badly as can be against the visual. Although to be fair it is may be just that the composer was trying to make music as unsure of it's purpose as the film itself seemed. They were probably asking for something part way between Star Wars and the Benny Hill theme.The only positive thing I can say about this film is that Milla Jovovich, for what it's worth, did her best. But then maybe that is part of the problem because she seemed to be trying to play a serious role in a less then serious film. Did she make a mistake trying to take the film seriously? Who knows. Other then that all I can say (positive) about the film is that I've seen worse.",

            "review_title": "Stylish action in a film that sadly suffers under the misdirected intervention of its production company",
            "content": "I bought this film recently, as I had found myself quite attracted by the trailer. Actually, I've wanted to see it since I first heard of it, as the idea sounded interesting. Reading a few reviews here on the site, I got to expecting an awful film... the majority seem to hate it. However, the Trivia page states that it was taken out of Kurt Wimmer(the writer and director)'s hands, so I also watched with that in mind. Apparently, his cut was deemed too \"emotional\". I wouldn't exactly say that the version I saw(which was, unfortunately, the short, theatrically released one, and not the slightly prolonged one that is said to increase its quality) lacked emotion, though it could have been better. As others say, the idea is definitely good, it's the execution that leaves something to be desired. First, the good points; the film has some incredibly stylized action, and a good amount of it. The visual style is amazing. The CGI, while at times cartoon-y(early on, I thought to myself that this would make an awesome video-game), is marvelous. In fact, if you watch this as a comic book brought to life, or a video-game in the form of a motion picture, you may enjoy it quite a lot... I know I did. The question is, should this in fact have been released in either of those two mediums... rather than as a film? Because the main issues(apart from what results of the cut (up) version) are ones that would not really be issues if it had been. There are \"static\" moments in the action, where everything stands (perfectly) still, which takes some intensity out of it(which would not happen if it were a comic book), and the presentation of the action scenes is very stylized... almost too much so, for a movie. The dialog varies... at times, it feels too \"fancy\", almost Shakespearean, but it can also be pretty cool. The acting varies, but I found little of it to be bad. Milla does well as usual in the \"tough, female warrior\" role, though this time with a deeper character(not to say that Joan of Arc was not one) than other times(*cough* Resident *cough* Evil). Cameron Bright does some of his best work here, and much of it is through gesturing and body language, although he wasn't exactly asked to do all that much in the other films I've seen him in...(those being Godsend and the third X-Men). He was quite good in The Butterfly Effect as well, though. The characters are full, if not all terribly fleshed out in the film. The heroine is one you want to succeed, the villain is one you love to hate. The humor is limited, but good. The pacing is fine, though it tends to feel like the film is rushing. Not too much, and it definitely didn't become overwhelming(like a Paul W.S. Anderson film, for example), nor did it run out of steam. The writing is fairly good, though there admittedly isn't that much of a story. There are several twists... they're great, though at least one seemed like it could have been put to more effective use. The trailer also gives two(maybe more) away, which is unfortunate. The production design and look are well-crafted, and the ideas explored are fascinating. The visuals and cinematography take a little getting used to, but I certainly grew to like them, before the film was over. The action is all very cool and slick, with several completely unique sequences. The fights, unfortunately, suffer from some repetition(one against all, cornering, etc.), and there is little in the way of a sense of danger towards Violet... she wins the fights with relatively little effort, in nearly every action sequence. Again, in a video-game or comic book, this would fly, but here, it almost leads to them becoming dull to watch... they didn't, for me, but I am quite a big fan of action, sword-fighting, shooting and martial arts... so I may not be the best to objectively judge. Wimmer's Gun Kata definitely did not disappoint me. I must admit, I am one of the people who did not watch Equilibrium; I am a fan of The Matrix, and as such, I, too, expected imitations to follow after its release around the turn of the millennium. Wimmer's successful sci-fi action piece looked like that, to me. Now, however, having seen what he can do when he is denied final cut... I will be on the lookout for it, and for any of his future projects. Screen Gems, however, who edited this... I will be wary of, from now on. The DVD comes with a \"making of\"-featurette of about half an hour, in five parts, 12 minutes of deleted scenes that sadly have no explanation as to why they were excised, and a reasonably informative and entertaining commentary track with Jovovich for the flick itself. I recommend this to any fan of comic books, video-games, martial arts and action. Watch it thinking of a comic book brought to life, a video-game put on the silver screen, or both... and hope along with me that they'll continue the story in either or both mediums. 7/10",

There would be potential to any kind of movie. But no; first action sequence starts to go wrong: Overacted and million times seen combat choreographs, guardians made out of glass, overuse of dramatic or \"dramatic\" (Jovovich can't act drama) expressions and camera drives. Also this basic declaration of total stupidism in action movies: Soldiers with projectile weapons try to _catch_ the main character, not _shoot_ her. Soldiers with all kinds of machine-guns also go face-to-face with a subject known to be dangerous. Also, those soldiers are SO poor shooters..how come they ever got selected to military/guard training? And what kind of efficient way of guarding is to stand in a circle? :D I also hate when combatants are made stupid and invalid weapon users in order to increase the amount of action and in order to add n+1 persons to main chars kill count.I've also always hated those over-complex combat techniques, which in practice could lead you into hospital, not beating the bad guys up. I mean that even in a movie, combat should aim to beating enemies up, not to look sexy or perform impressive acrobatics. Also motorcycle as a vehicle of this kind of a \"cool\" character is so old trick. Why there couldn't be a Mini Cooper? Super low-fidelity computer graphic also suck; I've seen better graphics even in a mid-quality computer games.Then another thing sucking: Milla Jovovich. Person, who doesn't achieve being sexy even by trying as hard as possible. Thing that, for example, Uma Thurman achieves even without trying. Also, when American tries to be cool in Japanese, it doesn't succeed, unless it's Uma. (: One thing I always wonder with this kind of movies is that how come they use almost centuries old weapon technology (Berettas, Uzis, G-36s) when all other tech is so advanced (disposable cellphones..)? And since when has a Micro-Uzi (even modified one) become wound-burning hot from its exteriors after shooting? Great laugh, though.One and only thing rocking in this movie are the sceneries. I see Wimmer being same kind of fetishist with all those gas masks and radiation signs as I am. However, he overuses them and soon it becomes an old \"invention\".After all, only good thing in a world of movies including \"V\" in its dialogs is followed by words \"for Vendetta\". This \"V\" sucks, big time.",

There is enough action to fully stock a chain of shops selling movie action sequences - a vast tonnage of ordnance is expended, and if that doesn't dispatch enough faceless goons then there is more than enough swordplay to do the trick (which it does).

But combing through the reviews, I see I'm not quite the only one.If this film has a forte, it is definitely the visual impact and the crew seems to know this. Toward that end, they give Milla Jovovich morphing costumes (most of which are plenty easy on the eye) and each fight sequence has its own distinct theme. The fights are definitely another character in the movie, really more prominent than most of the actual characters. Is this really a problem?I also found myself surprisingly taken with what little there was of a story. When Violet develops an attachment to the kid and it becomes the two of them against the world, that resonated with me. In a later scene she's paralyzed with grief and despair and that moment stuck with me. I would definitely like to see Kurt WImmer's cut wherein the emotional content isn't butchered by the suits.Okay, I know this film isn't going to be any sort of defining icon of our generation. But my expectations for this overall genre are never high and this one surprised me. I personally found Ultraviolet to be considerably more entertaining than similar offerings such as Aeon Flux or the more recent Clive Owen vehicle, Shoot 'Em Up.Will you be one of the proud few who \"get\" this movie?

The latter is especially bad when closeups of faces are shown, making everyone look bizarrely smooth and not in a necessarily beautiful way. The intro made me think it was based on a comic book and that's what they were going for with the cinematography, but sure enough it wasn't based on any source material.

The editing was terrible, especially during the fight scene were terrible.

            "content": "\"Ultraviolet\" is a fairly intelligent, fairly clever and fast-paced action script, directed by an incompetent hack. The interesting angle here is that in this case, writer and director are the same person.Being that Milla is the star here, and the trailer was a mess from start to finish: whiz bang effects and flying objects, no dialogue and all CGI, the trailer looked like a sequel to Ice Cube's motorcycle bomb, \"Torque.\" Cinema geeks, though, were maybe a bit curious about this one, because writer/director Kurt Wimmer was responsible for the very good \"Equilibrium,\" starring Christian Bale and Taye Diggs.\"Equilibrium\" was a clever, dystopian, character-driven drama featuring the made-up martial art \"gun kata,\" a form of martial arts that integrates the firearm. Though the vision of the future borrowed heavily from Kurt Vonnegut, George Orwell and others, the movie worked as both sci-fi, action movie, and character piece. It didn't get a U.S. theatrical release, but is well worth the rent.And so does Wimmer get a theatrical release with \"Ultraviolet,\" a movie he supposedly wrote for Milla after seeing her in \"Resident Evil,\" itself a movie that stole much of its ideas, but is still a tight action/horror movie worthy of midnight screenings and slumber parties. And Wimmer sat down and wrote a script, and had a lot of really good ideas.Wimmer thought of sub-atomic devices that create their own unique gravity. He thought of flat-space technology, where somehow small spaces can contain larger ones (nothing new; Star Trek uses this, but no one ever explained it very thoroughly). He thought of a plague that infected every human being alive, and while this isn't a new idea either, he made it bio-engineered, and likely to cause a human to want to drink blood. Oh, and he gave everyone actual martial arts abilities, not just made-up gun kata.All the makings of a great action movie, right? And even after the slow, personal pacing of \"Equilibrium,\" Wimmer screws this one up about eight ways from Sunday. Technology is never explained. Martial arts sequences are photographed poorly, if at all, rendering the choreography worthless, if it was there in the first place. A great rooftop sequence is wasted, because the camera jumps from gun barrel, to eyeball, to person's ear, all for no reason. That's not stylish, that's pointless and confusing, and the wall-to-wall CGI from start to finish just distracts. This isn't \"Star Wars\" or even \"Sin City.\" Keep it simple, Wimmer. You're not George Lucas.All that said, the dialogue isn't terrible, though it suffers from both too much, and not enough, exposition throughout. William Fichtner is so good, he's in the wrong movie. And the opening credits sequence is even better than the movie, working cast and crew names into comic book art. If this movie comes on cable, I'll watch that part and nothing else.In the end, the film is about half-a-shade better than people are saying it is, and far, FAR superior to the incomprehensible, poorly shot, poorly lit, poorly written \"Resident Evil: Apocalypse.\" If somehow you liked RE:A, then you'll like \"Ultraviolet.\" If, on the other hand, you loved \"Equilibrium,\" don't spoil your illusions-- wait for whatever film Wimmer does next. Assuming he gets to make one.",

In the first few minutes we are told that we are about to enter a world we don't understand. And that is completely right I don't understand any of it and neither are we allowed any breathing space in it. Most of the suspense is taken away when in the early moments of the film we are told that any tight spot that our heroine is found under can be undone by coming up with some totally random device that we had no idea existed a few minutes ago. This is a bad film but I would still recommend it . Why well to some people this may turn out to be a real GUILTY PLEASURE! Seriously Kurt Wimmer who revels in his cheese smells real bad here",

It manages the impossible by making Milla Jovovich un-sexy. She does not look like a real woman. Through the soft focus lens, her face appears as lamely computer-generated and un-textured as the rest of the film. Jovovich's unique face is composed of hard angles that create interesting shadows. Why would you mess with that? A toned midriff cannot carry a movie.Either Jovovich cannot act or she needs a new agent. The script was absolutely non-existent, but somehow William Fichtner (poor guy needs a new agent, too; he's a good actor) barely comes away clean. Everyone else in the film cannot makes heads or tails of their lines, and it is clear that they have no idea who their characters are, what they are doing, or why they are doing it.The music is mind-numbing and entirely uninteresting. If you like techno/trance/beat music, this is for you.The \"action\" sequences were all the same. Every single one. There was no tension prior to a fight scene. Everyone who challenged Violet either got in a circle or lined up to die.The universe of Ultraviolet exists without explanation, despite the attempt at exposition by Violet. The audience has no sense of why and how things work: Why do you need helicopters and helicopter blades in a world where motorcycles can defy gravity? Why do some characters have to carry around their guns and other ones can hide them in some sort of personal cyberspace? Perhaps most infuriating is the laziness of the film. There was no attempt to flesh out a story, just buzzwords like \"virus\" and \"vampires.\" Maybe the director and producers thought the audience hadn't seen Underworld, it's sequel, Aeon Flux, and The Matrix. Or maybe they did, and that's why they didn't bother to tell a different story or to even tell a story at all. It's been done before, and it's been done much better.",

Here's a little advice for Kurt Wimmer: Equilibrium was fine the way it was, it did not need to be remade with a female main-character and a B level science fiction story line.

While I was unimpressed with some of the acting in this movie, as well as some of the plot details (or lack thereof), I was fascinated by the color and graphic qualities of the film. The music was well suited, and Mila Jovovich gets an A+ for continuing to take on roles that are quirky and challenging. The action scenes in this movie were precise and entertaining--as was the whole movie. It's not meant to be \"Mona Lisa Smile\" or \"As Good As It Gets,\" it's just a fun sci-fi movie.

It was a random collection of badly choreographed action sequences, excruciatingly poor one-liners and close-up shots of Milla Jovovich's face and ass. At the start I began to get apprehensive as the initial action sequence unfolded in the Blood Bank (what was the point of that scene anyway, it had NO relevance at all to the story), and over the next 30 minutes I got more and more embarrassed at the number of people giggling and laughing at the screen. By the time one hour had passed, people were leaving in droves. The ending was a relief, I have never seen such a retarded film in my life. The advertising poster was more intelligent than the film itself, and there were so many plot flaws that I can't mention them all in 1000 words. The fact that I didn't realise that they were vampires until 20 minutes from the end reflects the level of storytelling here, my recommendation to the writer is that he should go and jump off a very tall building.

Now, the humans and hemophages are at war. Violet steals a weapon, which turns out to be a child. The child has some stuff in his blood that can be used to kill all humans or all hemophages. So, she is constantly attacked in attempts to reach the \"weapon.\" And there, the story ends. It's all a collection of scenes where Violet kills people. Yes, it's entertaining, and it's brought flair by the camera, but it shows that Kurt Wimmer is lacking creativity when the story line constantly repeats itself. It seems great and absorbing at first, but after we are treated to the same type of scene over and over, it gets a bit irritating. But, if \"Ultraviolet\" succeeds in anything, it provides good fun for its target audience, which is probably teenage boys. The whole world that we don't understand looks pretty good. Everything- the fight scenes, the set and especially the characters all look really good! The action is stunning and entertaining, even though there is a lot of it. The best scene was when she was getting chased by a helicopter. So, it has hot girls, plenty of action scenes, and loads of special effects. Add some music and weapons, and you have \"Ultraviolet.\" Now, can you see why teenage boys would like it? But, the movie is obvious style-over-substance. Every scene is short, and the next one has the characters in a different setting with a different subject on their mind. There are at least 3 or 4 of these scenes, and that shows a lack of creativity. Take this: Violet is about to battle 700 men, and then she ends up in a park with the \"weapon child.\" Weird? I don't understand Violet's world.What happened to fighting 700 men? How did a child get hidden in a case? How can she fight more people than her? How come she constantly changes color and clothes? How come she uses the gravity device in only one scene? How can she pass off as being human in the beginning scene? Why do the two hemopahges attack her? Why does one of the characters have something in his nose? What kind of weapon does she have that can transform? How come everybody shoots at everything? To add to that, the story is thin. It's highly lacking of and depth. The only part that had enough detail (besides the background) was Violet. Every other character hardly has a personality, besides the ones that we would expect.But, the fight scenes are entertaining. It's easier to rent the movie and skip the fight scenes, and stare at the special effects and main character, because this movie packs nothing that can be labeled as substance, unless you count an incoherent storyline. I don't understand Violet's world.Don't forget. It has one of the worst lines in cinema. \"Are you mental?\"Good: Action, good camera angles, special effects, hot girlsBad: Shallow, bad dialogue, repeated and incoherent storyline, Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",

I'm still in shock actually, part of me refuses to believe that somebody got payed to do this. it has ABSOLUTELY NO REDEEMING qualities aside from one shot of Mila's naked butt. The plot was non-existent, stupid, boring, and pointless even by action movie standards. The choice of vampires is completely redundant and has nothing to do with anything. Seriously, NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING. They don't drink blood, they don't shy away from the sun, pointless. Furthermore, the acting isn't bad, because it's not even there. You have to have acting before rating, and there is none whatsoever in this film. vegetables are more animated than Mila or anyone else here. No acting present. We see the same scene again and again and again, Mila kicking major ass in moronic, highly unimaginative and repetitive ways, even when it's 500 against her or something. What's the point in watching someone so invincible there's no challenge (hence no drama) in the film? Don't filmmakers understand that a movie with no significant movies is BORING? Kill Bill pushed the massively-outnumbered show down to the limit, and at least Tarantino did it in style. the settings look retarded and amateur, the bad guy is a douche, and even the camera is out of focus sometimes, HIGHLY UNPROFESSIONAL stuff.

            "content": "A few weeks ago I rented Equilibrium, the only other movie directed by Kurt Wimmer (he's written a few), and I found it to be overly-consumed with style, but possessing just enough presence to be a moderately enjoyable film. I've heard the film has a cult following, and I was looking forward, a little, to Ultraviolet because usually a first time director who is a little long on mood but short on plot tends to tighten up in both directions and produce a better effort the second time around.Not so with this film, however. Ultraviolet is a confused, convoluted mess, with almost no thought given to plotting at all; it's barely an excuse for some ridiculous action sequences strung together, let alone a film. The film is set \"in a world we probably don't understand\" (now there's truth in advertising) and follows the story of one Violet (Milla Jovovich), a sword-wielding hottie in a skimpy midriff baring outfit who is being hunted because she's a mutant/vampire/ultrahuman/different/take your pick. Leading the hunt trying to catch her is Daxus (Nick Chinlund), an unimpressive functionary with little screen presence. Also on Violet's side is fellow mutant/vampire/ultrahuman/different/take your pick scientist Garth (William Fitchner), who builds her weapons/brings her back from near-death/ fulfills a few sidekick duties (Fitchner also played the leader of the Underground in Equilibrium).The plot \u0096 as far as I can tell, anyway \u0096 is mostly Daxus trying to capture Violet and Violet trying to rescue some kid (Six, played, and I use that term loosely, by Cameron Bright) who may or may not hold the key to 'curing' her, because apparently being a mutant/vampire/ultrahuman/different/take your pick is eventually fatal. Why you'd want to be 'normal' when you can change your hair and garment color at will, survive fifty-story jumps, and move faster than lightning is beyond me, but that's another story (it would have to be as it's not explained in this one).Violet kicks, punches, stabs, and mostly shoots her way through progressively larger numbers of maladroit villains, all of whom stand there and just take the beating, for the most part. After defeating a room full of guards without taking a scratch, she ascends to the roof where she takes on forty dudes from the vampire Yakuza (again, without a scratch) before riding her motorcycle up the side of a building, into a helicopter, and shooting everyone in sight. It's comic-book violence exploded to an absurd level, where it actually becomes funny rather than cool. You don't laugh with Violet; you laugh at her. Repeatedly.Jovovich tries to be a good soldier through all of this; no doubt her experiences making the abominable Resident Evil 2 prepared her to be in mindless films with lots of action, and I've read she trained quite a while to be able to do the martial arts moves here. She looks good and moves fine, but no one ever confused Milla with a great actress, and if she keeps doing crap like this, no one ever will. It's hardly even worth mentioning anyone else; the dialogue and direction are so bad all of the other actors couldn't have done a good job even if they wanted to. Even in this mess, though, young Cameron Bright stands out as truly awful; obviously some studio honch's kid, the cherubic little brat is so flat and dull you suspect Wimmer was busy playing poker rather than giving him any sort of direction. It's not easy to stand out as terrible in a movie this thoroughly bad, but Bright manages it.Obviously the only people who need to see this film are those whose intimate fantasies involve Milla Jovovich; she's hot, she's slinky, she looks great. But for anyone not completely hung up on her, don't bother. You won't find anything redeeming in here at all: no good ideas, no cool concepts, not even much interesting design work.

ZERO. and she was supposed to be slicing them. but they don't even hide it. she slices, they scream and die. no blood. not even cut up clothes. it's insane. they show multiple scenes where you can see the sword contacting the guy's neck, she slices, but 0 blood. unbelievable.this movie makes me said, because it could have been an awesome action flick. i hope they remake this with competent film-makers one day (1 viewing, 5/17/2020)",

            "review_title": "Slick looking comic book film",
            "content": "Director Kurt Wimmer wowed sci-fi fans in 2002 when he made his first film Equilibrium. Equilibrium was set in a dark future where there is no freedom of any kind and a ruthless all commanding government rules over everyones thoughts, decisions, feelings and lives. It wasn't a huge hit, but it must have sold a butt load of DVDs cause Wimmers been given a second chance to direct and here he comes once again with yet another action sci-fi film thats sure to satisfy sci-fi/action fans.The story for Ultraviolet gets a little complex, but it goes something like this. The government tried to create a race of super-humans but by mistake created a race called the hemophages. The hemophages have more strength, a mean set of fangs and a desire for human blood. The humans are trying to eradicate all hemophages and have come up with a way to do so. Thats when Violet (a hemophage) is sent into the humans headquarters to destroy the secret weapon. The Blood War has begun. What ensues is a game of cat and mouse across a futuristic landscape filled with gravity defying motorcycles, super hot chicks who kick ass and swords made of fire.When I first saw this movie what first popped into my mind was that it was the complete anti-thesis of what Equilibrium was. Well, at least from a visual standpoint. I say this cause the movie is still about a totalitarian government trying to control all, the movie is still very much futuristic and it still has awesome sword/gunfights much like the ones we saw in Equilibrim. But when we look at Ultraviolet from a visual standpoint the movie is completely different from Equilibrium. Things are not dark and gritty at all, in fact its the complete opposite of that. Everything is bright and colorful, lots of bright blues and red dominate the screen, lots of yellows, I mean whatever color you can come up with shows up on screen. And let me tell you it gave the movie a very shinny happy look that I dug lots! This movie is the pure definition of eye candy! You may get a little lost with the story, you may not like some of the CGI, but you will love the colorful slick look of the flick. So expect something that will jump at you from the screen.Storywise the movie tries to set its foundations pretty fast during a voice over in the first 15 minutes of the film. There's a lot of set up for this story and it almost feels like we walked into the middle of a film already in progress but I kind of dug how fast it went. Dare I say that I think the flick was trying to establish its story fast so it could get to the good stuff...the action! I say this because after the movie establishes its foundations it explodes into a series of slick looking action pieces that are sure to satisfy any action science fiction fan. In what film have you seen a motorcycle that can run through walls? In none I tell you! I must admit that this movie surprised me with many of the ideas that it presented. Violet has a kick ass anti gravity belt that allows her to walk on the ceiling as she kicks her enemies ass! Can you get cooler then that? I think not! So be ready for some original action sequences. Its obvious that Wimmer put a lot of effort in making everything look slick, futuristic and different. Every building, every uniform, every vehicle, every computer or machine is like nothing you have ever seen and I have to give credit to Wimmer and his crew for creating a visually cool/slick/colorful flick. Cool is definitely a word I would use in describing this flick.The movie does have a glitch or two though. It ain't a perfect film. In some instances you can tell that the movie had some great ideas, but the budget for computer generated effects wasn't too big. For example, even though the idea about a wall riding motorcycle does in fact kick ass, there is a scene or two in there that looks too cgi for my tastes. Same goes for some helicopters that look like something right out of a video game. But you know what, I was having so much fun with the action, slick colorful visuals and fast paced story that I honestly didn't care, I let all that go cause I was having a blast with this flick.Milla Jovovich -who is hotness personified- has becomed this generations \"Ms. Sci-Fi\" with so many cool science fiction and horror films under her belt. And you know what? That suits me just fine because she does a great job in everything she is in. I loved her in Resident Evil, I loved her in The Fifth Element and I absolutely loved her here. In a strange turn of events, in Ultraviolet she is a kick ass assassin/vampire yet she has a maternal side that pops up every now and again however reluctant her character was in showing it and I enjoyed that little back and forth between being maternal and being a kick ass assassin trying to save the human race from themselves.So in conclusion, this movie isn't going to change the world. But its a cool as hell little film, with a great slick look. A movie for comic book geeks and sci-fi fans as evidenced by its way cool opening sequence which is composed of a series of different comic book covers. One thing is for sure, this movie knew who its target audience was! In my humble opinion I believe that Wimmer has scored another winner. Whats next for this extremely visual director? Ill be on the look out thats for sure! Rating: 4 out of 5",

Instead of taking a deeper view of what was engaging about these movies, it jams all the aspects of \"Wow, that looked cool!\" together in a mish-mash that simply does not work.The story is simplistic and uninspired; the dialog seems to have been written by an eight year old; and the special effects, while passable in some places, are simply put together in a hodge-podge mess. Ultraviolet embodies why movies that are created foremost as a showcase for SFX and visual extravaganzas, with the plot and script tacked on afterward, invariably fall short.Simply put, this movie is awful.

            "content": "Ultraviolet reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.comrating: 1 out of 4Ultraviolet reminds me of a bad techno song: an electronic, neon pounding, continues on and on and on and on, pounding and pounding, boom bada bada bada boom bada bada boom, until it lulls itself into a tinny silence, with annoying symbol sounds and electronic squeaks, attempting to raise a quiet anticipation in its listener, only to revert back to an equally floor-vibrating/migraine-inducing pounding that continues on in its tireless repetition for what seems to be, well, let's face it, an eternity.For those familiar with Writer/Director Kurt Wimmer's earlier work--Equilibrium in particular--Ultraviolet will be no surprise; it'll just be a sad digression. Wimmer takes what made Equilibrium an indie hit, gives it a slippery coating of neon paint, sheds away any depth of character, and exponentially raises the body count while lowering the MPAA rating to PG-13. He then rolls this film out onto a pastel filter, wads it up and throws this piece of anime-fanboy trash our way. The two films' premises are essentially the same: big evil totalitarian government against little rebel with not-so-little powers. Equilibrium spiced this equation up with a nice turn of philosophy, where Ultraviolet instead opts to give its rebels pointy teeth and call them vampires. Milla Jovovich plays the heroine this time, prancing around in skin-tight spandex and expelling endless sprays of bullets. Her name is Violet, but since she's obviously \"ultra\", we all like to call her Ultraviolet. In the dictator's role is Nick Chinlund as Daxus. The little boy caught between the sides is Six, played by the insidious little actor Cameron Bright. The details of the story are superfluous, since its only purpose is to work as a clothesline for the film's countless fight sequences. Suffice it to say that Violet has to protect Six. Why doesn't really matter. The film doesn't slow down enough for anybody to care. And when it does finally put the bullets on hold, like a bad techno song, the lull is rife with annoying little electronic squeaks of pathos. It's all really very silly. But in a film where plot doesn't matter\u0097think last year's Ong Bak\u0097our enjoyment is contingent upon the film's successful execution of its main event. For Ultraviolet, its featured talent is its combat. But maybe I was blinded by the neon glare, but I just wasn't that impressed. Out of the dozen-plus action sequences, only a couple kept me from checking the time on my wristwatch. In fact, much of my wristwatch's action gave me more excitement than Ultraviolet's mass-murder, but maybe because the hands on my watch ticked away the time until I could depart from Wimmer's pastel unreality. What's worse, the two action sequences that fingered past my glazed-over eyes were straight out of Equilibrium. Oh, Wimmer\u0085The fault in these action sequences is that Wimmer chose to not fix what wasn't broken with Equilibrium. Problem is, critics and audiences alike forgave Wimmer's low-budget methods from Equilibrium because, you guessed it, Wimmer had a low budget. But Wimmer was given $30 million for Ultraviolet; easily enough to abandon the cheap camera tricks of Equilibrium. But instead, Wimmer ate away at the $30 million with his effects-heavy reality. Reality, however, is a generous word for Ultraviolet's setting. Violet's opening lines of narration read \"You may not understand my world\". This is very true, but for the sole reason that the CGI effects are so scrappy that it's nearly impossible to actually believe in their transition to celluloid. Somebody must have noticed how bad Ultraviolet looked. And this person should have done the right thing and shredded it all to pieces. It'd be one less comic book knock-off for us to wade through. -www.samseescinema.com",

            "content": "Equilibrium blind-sided us because we couldn't imagine that Christian Bale and Sean Bean would be in such a horrendously written film. We kept looking for the humor - the wink that would let us know it was a parody. It never materialized.So we knew that Wimmer would produce another incredible, outlandish, horrendous, execrable film. But this honestly sunk lower than that. Much. Much. Lower. I understand eye candy for the sake of eye candy. I understand checking your brain at the door and enjoying the pretty pictures. I understand spending the budget on after effects and forgetting to hire actual actors. I even understand the people who think that Wimmer is some sort of visionary and not the repetitive hack he clearly is. I appreciate the occasional 'really dumb but really pretty' movie.The CGI exteriors (anywhere that they were not in a small, highly lit room) were one long video game cut scene using outdated source technology. They looked terrible. The glaring high beam of the visual style loses its punch about 5 minutes in so the rest of the film that could have been eye candy is just one long overly stylized nightmare of fuzz filters and geometric interiors. The basic plot - okay - fine... battle between the establishment (religion + government=evil again, just like Equilibrium) and those it had decided to exterminate (just like Equilibrium)... trite, annoyingly easy, and poorly laid out.If you're banking on style - you need to HAVE a style and that style needs to be fairly unique and not an obvious aping of your own and other's films. And if your characters are going to be trite two dimensional idiots - at least make them CONSISTENT trite two dimensional idiots. And if you're going for an action film, hire an action director who understands what actually makes sense on screen instead of relying on what would \"look cool\" on paper or in a comic book.Immediately after watching this movie - we watched Blood Rayne. And Uwe Boll managed to look like Spielberg in comparison. If you're prepared to have your intelligence insulted over and over again for 90 minutes - this movie is worth it just to see what some studios are willing to bank roll.",

            "content": "Ultra Violet is a great, fun action film. It really does put the \"science fiction\" back into Sci-Fi action films using creative technology to embellish main character Violet's capabilities. It also takes chase scenes to places they've never gone before (specifically, sideways). As you would probably expect from a Milla Jovovich action vehicle, the plot is quite thin and serves mostly as a source of sympathy for Violet, and a reason to have many, many, many fights. However, since the plot is so minimal it doesn't get bogged down with itself or worse, have huge holes or contradictions. There's enough there to motivate the characters and to let the villain have some surprises up his sleeve.The fights are really good. As with Equilibrium, director Kurt Wimmer has done some more fanciful imagining of the possibilities of blending pistols and martial arts (and in this case, dance) into a m\u00eal\u00e9e fight sequence. Realistic? No; Cool as Hell, yes. And, he doesn't wear the tricks out. This sort of film typically has a lot of the main character dispatching minions with ridiculous ease. In this case, if she's not pulling off a new move, they keep the minion-icide to a minimum on-screen. That really helps keep the movie moving along.The visual look is color-drenched, and somewhat-obviously-CGI; basically, like a futuristic comic brought to life. In fact, the anime influence is even mentioned in the opening credits sequence. It doesn't come across quite as well as Sin City's stark, mostly black & white look did, but it's a good effort. It does contain the feel of the film very well.Milla's performance was very good. I don't just mean the fighting, I think she did very well at the few personal bits the film had. I definitely felt very sympathetic for her, maybe more than I was supposed to.

The kid actor playing number #6 is really, really, really...bad. He looks like the kid in The Sixth Sense when he sees ghosts, but permanently.

I also loved Equilibrium, although it had a few weaknesses, it was an awesome movie, and did Kurt Wimmer good credit.Ultraviolet, however, may prove a low point in both Jovovich's and Wimmer's filmography. The movie simply has NO STORYLINE. Even if I wanted to write a spoiler, I couldn't do so, because there really is absolutely no story that I could betray. The film moves seamlessly from one action sequence to another, has ABSOLUTELY CRAPPY CG, and the characters cannot even be described as 2-dimensional. If anything, they're about as emotionally intense as a paper clip. If you've watched anything remotely using CG these last few years, you'll be horrified at the CG sequences this movie hits its viewers with. It's abominably blocky, blatantly unrealistic, the textures look live they've been stolen from a decade old Corel Draw add on CD, in some parts the action sequences even stutter, which is integrated as a stylistic element in some of the later parts of the movie. None of this can hide the crappy quality of the sequences, however. Since it is *IN* to have child actors in action movies again (recap: Terminator 2, Mercury Puzzle), this film also boasts one, though thankfully with very few lines. Apparently, \"Six\" alias Cameron Bright was denied his lollipop, as he persistently keeps a scowl in his face even when it doesn't suit the scene.From the trailer, it wasn't unquestionably obvious that this movie would be about vampires - I'm sorry, *hemophages* -, which in light of recent blockbusters leads me to believe that this addition was made to the script after the numbers for Underworld: Evolution were in. It really doesn't add anything to the already non-existent storyline, but gave the make-up department a reason to go to Walmart to shop for fake teeth. Has anybody even reviewed the movie before it was sent to theaters? Not only is the make-up work and digital remastering crappy at the best of times, but the props are ridiculous. In one and the same scene, Jovovich's face is well-textured and irregular (read: natural) when viewed from the side, but once the camera goes into frontal close-up, her face is so ruthlessly digitally softened up that it looks like a latex mask.These are just the things that irritated me during the first half of the movie, before it degenerated even further into a remarkably bloodless mayhem of severed limbs, bullet-time shoot-outs and crappy CG sequences.A few days before Ultraviolet, I watched Deep Rising. While the latter may not be a gem of movie history, it also has a very nice female co-lead in the form of Famke Janssen, it has steady action sequences and - for its time - acceptable CG effects. I really should have stayed home, invited a few friends, and watched Deep Rising instead of spending precious money and time on a movie so useless, so utterly devoid of character development and storyline, so insultingly bad CG, that I'm sure my IQ must've dropped several points just from sitting through it to the end.Don't watch this movie. It doesn't even serve as an amusingly bad movie, because at least after the first motorcycle chase, you'll feel insulted by the lack of work and dedication that should have gone into producing this.",

I suppose that it was a big plot point in the comic (which I've never heard of). The visuals in this film are fun, like a decent-budgeted music video. The use of color was really engaging. However, a lot of the CG shots just look ludicrous. The problem is once the visual ecstasy wears off, you're left with a convoluted story and a heroine you don't really like or care about. Violet just comes off as an apathetic bitch, not some kind of bitter anti-hero. What Hollywood keeps missing when it tries to create a female action heroine, is that she should still be a woman. I mean, Violet lost her baby(from what I could tell)! She should still have emotions, she should still be vulnerable sometimes. She doesn't have to be exploited for pointless T&A. She should be complicated. Like a real woman, or a real person in general. Maybe they should have taken a page from James Cameron. Ripley, Sarah Connor, Max from Dark Angel? He actually has some ideas about sci-fi heroines that connect emotionally.",

So much so, if these techniques were used in that movie, \"The Matrix\" would have easily defeated \"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace\" as the #1 movie in 1999. So action alone gives Ultraviolet a 9/10, possibly a 10/10.But as with most movies, incredible visuals, a sexy heroine, and well choreographed action means nothing without a story, and the story nearly killed Ultraviolet. Even worse, the acting was also below standard. Where the story, if you can even spot it, and the action are totally incompatible. Warrenting at the most a 1/10.If stylized action is your thing that is at least up to Matrix level regardless of story, definitely recommend Ultraviolet. But if you want, well, a plot, look for something else.The visual effects were obviously not big budget, not in the $100 million dollar range. But in a way that is a good thing, so the financial loss is minimized.Bottom line, loved the action and the visuals, hated the story and the acting. As a general movie, it can be at the most a 2/10. As a stylized action movie, 4/10 at the most.Splitting the difference, give Ultraviolet .... 3/10.",

            "content": "First, let me start by saying I am both a huge fan of Milla J, and Kurt W's movie Equilibrium (most underrated movie). That said, both have failed to make a worthy effort with this movie. It is as boring as it is pointless of statement. The action sequences are tired and slow \u0096 one so overdone in other movies, I am wondering how it made it past the editing floor (UV jumping off the roof and lands in a crouched runner's pose with small cracks in the earth beneath her \u0096 hmmmm, can you say Underworld or Matrix, or\u0085.you get the point). The visual effects are interesting in and in themselves \u0096 shape shifting colors and anti-gravity. That is about it though as none are really explored or explained to any satisfaction. Neither was the whole vampire concept of the movie. The government was experimenting with biological enhancements for soldiers and created vampires that desperately want to be cured and return to humanity? After which follows some bland allusions to different breeds of transforming hemophage types that are loosely aligned yet somehow competing (for what? Who knows or cares? \u0096 not the viewer). And a guy driving around in 18 wheeler (secret bio lab) dragging a big red container can't be tracked by a government sophisticated enough to create a bio-weapon powerful enough to enslave the entire human race? Basically, this was probably a decent idea (at one point) with poor execution. The writing isn't tight or at least didn't translate in the visual (that could be due to the poor shots and direction). Saying it might have been a good idea though may be giving it more credit than is due (again, since I thought Equilibrium was superb). If you are addict of japanimation and/or live action doctored with a lot of CG, then perhaps some mild enjoyment will result. I found the movie lacking in essentials on every level. It had no story, boring action, no surprises, and the acting was overdone.Don't say I didn't warn you.",

            "content": "Before I start off commenting, let me say that I've had two years of working for a movie theater chain in the US to bring to bear on this experience. I have seen bad movies (If anything because I didn't have to pay for them) This...was not as bad as it could have been.Nor was it on the Caliber of Wimmer's other directorial work (Hell, most of his writing work too). In a head-to-head contest I have no doubt that Equilibrium would dominate completely, with the recruit not far behind.Yet I didn't walk out, and I'd go see it again (preferably in the company of friends).If you're not a particularly visual person you might find some of the cityscapes and futuristic devices overkilled (I counted gags stolen from Blade Runner and Milla's own Fifth Element among other things) And if you're looking for a deep thought-provoking film or one that leaves you asking \"...why?\" at the end this isn't the movie for you. Wait until Silent Hill comes out in April, or for that matter go and rent 2001.This was a popcorn flick.The story centers around Violet, citizen in a world where AIDS has been replaced by a blood- eating disorder called HGV; turning citizens into faster, stronger versions of themselves coupled with an allergy to sunlight and a need for sometimes constant blood transfusions.Let me translate that for you. VAMPIRES IN THE FUTURE.Violet becomes embroiled in a bitter struggle when she is sent to capture a \"weapon\" that turns out to be a Six, a child. Cue the sudden \"Man on Fire\" impulse to protect the little boy using her supreme skills of ass-kicking.once again translated: MILLA IS GOING TO OPEN A CAN OF WOOP-DIDDY ON FOLKS.Any person, (any rational person) would be immediately turned away by the \"Vampires in the future\" bit as I was. I can recall sitting in the theater very vividly and mentally going \"....What?\" at the snark comments and Milla leaping like a faun on crack across the screen. About halfway through the film as Milla was facing down yet another room full of people who wanted her dead simply because she was Milla Jovovitch (perhaps they weren't happy with her work on Resident Evil: Apocalypse) It hit me like a slap in the face. This is a Hong Kong Style Action Movie.True it didn't have some of the more subtle plot nuances that a great deal of Hong Kong Action flicks do (Hell, Tarantino did it better) but that's what it was. Kurt Wimmer's growing contribution to a great number of Filmmakers and TV directors who have fallen in love with the far east. Sure it lacked the finesse of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (But that was Asian initially) It completely destroyed the stoic good nature of HERO, and it made no claim whatsoever to the deep and thought provoking message that the Matrix gave us.It was fun. It was 88 minutes of Escape. Sure the fight scenes were repetitive, sure some of the concepts were unbelievable, but it was fun. It shouldn't have reminded me of Kung Fu Hustle but some of the lines and blatant threats brought back memories of Characters silhouetted in hallways before holding out a hand and asking their antagonists to \"Come and get it\"Too often in movies today we're seeing \"remakes\" or rehashing of a proved concept time and time again. Hollywood is in dire straits, saddled with a plethora of remakes from it's brothers and sisters in neighboring countries. In desperation we're turning to our own past to find films to create fresh fodder for an uncompromising audience that demands total and complete entertainment catering to their specific whims.I don't applaud Kurt Wimmer for \"Vampires in the Future\" because-frankly-he could have done it better. I don't applaud Milla for illustrating once again that yes she has a very nice body and yes if called upon she could probably break most of us into tiny pieces. I applaud them however for trying for a spark of originality regardless of how ridiculous the concept and how much they borrowed from other sci-fi movies to make it.He did the same thing for EquilibriumI've seen bad movies. I've searched desperately for some saving grace as characters bumble through lines and try to come off as serious-or jump start a franchise. Ultraviolet's not Equilibrium, (not by a long shot) but it still manages to be a fun good time at the movies.Will it win an Oscar? Of course not. Does it deserve accolades? not really. In a world where Hollywood is relying on zombie resurrection techniques to bring back life to an industry that's running out of it however I'll gladly overlook the \"Vampires in the Future\" concept and try to puzzle out a story. Because hey. It could be Catwoman.",

In this sense, it's reminiscent of The Fifth Element (another Milla movie), although cinematically, a little more artful and surreal with softer camera work.As an action movie, this is second to none. The movie wastes little time to get into the action. Almost immediately, the movie goes into intense fighting and tension, and it virtually does not stop.So, if one is looking for a lot of action and a lot of very entertaining cinematography, intense fight scene after fight scene, this movie will not leave one wanting.Its flaw, if you would call it that, is that its plot is quite thin. In fact, the many \"turns\" that are innate to any action movie are done quite sloppily and sometimes arbitrarily. The effect is that the conflict between the characters and the evolution of the plot seems a bit amateurish and prosaic. I know many will harp on this as denoting this as a bad movie, but as I stated earlier, this is subjective, depending on what one wants.If one wants a VERY prototypical quasi-futuristic action flick, reminiscent of The Fifth Element, Underworld, X-men, The Matrix, Spider-man, etc., as I did, this movie will be extremely entertaining and visually appealing and thus, I give it my very high recommendation",

I was severely disappointed by this movie, not only with the dialogue and lack of coherency and plot, but because a decent actor (William Fichtner) and a good director managed to not make this work. Fichtner was underused as a character, and Wimmer must have gone on a mental vacation while filming this. Milla Jovovich should stick to Resident Evil movies, and Cameron Bright needs to crawl in a hole somewhere. He has the power to ruin most every movie he's in, so why do directors continually give him work? The plot line...alright I couldn't really find one, but it hardly made any sense. With little to no background on the characters or the reasons why humanity has \"evolved\" the way it did were left completely out of the picture. The main villain was nothing more than a joke, and I don't have enough space or patience to explain my dislike of him. A minor point, but one I need to make, is that the film was far too short. Everything was rushed into and crammed together so that it made hardly any sense. If it could have been stretched out by another half hour or so, things could have flowed more naturally (although it still probably wouldn't make up for how bad this film is).That's the bad (and not even all of it). Here's the good: the fight sequences and the use of color. The fights were beautifully choreographed and really the only things that kept me watching this movie. The colors were bold and vibrant, and even though their constant changing was never explained (like so many other things), they were very nice to look at for an hour and a half.The only reason I gave this film a five instead of a two or three is because I'm giving Wimmer a break and I'm holding out hope for him. After the way he was treated by Dimension Studios, I can't blame him entirely for this travesty. Plus, I know that he has more talent and skill to make a better movie in the future.

            "content": "Wow, was this movie bad! Bad writing, bad fight scenes, bad special effects.WRITING/PLOT: Unlike most second-tier comic-book films, Ultraviolet assumes that the viewer has read the comic books or been filled in by somebody who has. Anybody who hasn't will likely find the plot and character motivations difficult to follow. Why do the groups want to kill each other? Is there a benefit to either side in not finding a cure? FIGHT SCENES: If there was something impossible, we just didn't see it and were expected to guess how our heroine achieved success. In other fights, the special effects make the Matrix and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon look like documentaries containing actual fights. Finally, in lesser situations, the bad guys were dumber than the bad guys in B-Westerns.SPECIAL EFFECTS: What were they thinking? Even where they copied the Matrix style speed moves (bullet-dodging), they couldn't make it look good. It's telling that the best special effects in the movie were the distance shots of the main building in the shape of a biohazard symbol and the tall \"tower\" in the city center, both of which left the viewers wondering how that building could be useable.FINAL THOUGHTS: Cameron Bright does a decent job playing the weird, creepy, kid. However, the only apparent reason for the kid to be weird or creepy is to make the audience suffer.Usually with a star who has one acclaim as one of the \"FHM's 100 Sexiest Women in the World\", \"VH1's 100 Most Hottest Celebrity bodies\", and \"Maxim's Hot 100 of 2005\" list, you can expect some other entertainment. However, Jovovich's considerable natural beauty is sorely lacking, apparently edited out in favor of special effects and image shots.",

The script was just poor and the acting reflected it in everyone that wasn't Milla Jovovich, Cameron Bright, or William Fichtner.Wimmer has made quite a few good movies so far and this could have been so much better, especially with some of the concepts.

            "content": "WOW! I saw the scores, I read the reviews and I'm not a fan of Wimmer or Equilibrium but because I'm masochistic I had to rent Ultraviolet. Actually, to tell you the truth by the time I was popping it into my DVD player I was kind of figuring I would be getting a good laugh from the movie (note: this is an upswing in my pre-mood for the movie) The movie starts off with this pseudo Marvel comics intro, it even goes as far as tries to be like the intro of Mallrats but instead of using the actual artist to do comic covers it goes with a bunch of knock offs.I have to state that this movie jumps right into the story; it's even quicker than any of the Romero Dead flicks, but then again those movies were actually 'written' when you compare it to Ultraviolet. Beside the well known studio editing they seemed to have re-dubbed over half the movie, at some points I was wondering if I was actually watching a movie that was originally filmed in English with all the excessive out of synch lip movement I saw going on.The rest of the movie is just schlock crap, honestly. The v/fx reminded me of Sci-Fi Channels quirky commercials, all of which looks rushed and half ass but in UV they decided to over-compensate the blue screen by going with all blue lighting in hopes that this would fool the audience into thinking that it's not crap but style.After watching the movie I could see why the studio pulled the project from Wimmer and just decided to do what they could to try and make a buck. It's as if Wimmer sat down to Blade, Blade Runner, 28 days later and a few episodes of Aeon Flux, picked out a few gimmicks he really liked and wrote a movie around them. The movie constantly seemed to contradict itself especially with the how easy it was to spread the disease. Honestly, if it was as communicable as they kept saying in the movie, I think we'd be seeing people in a lot more plastic bubbles, not just walking around with their SARs masks on, especially with Six, if he had something in his genetics that was as deadly to them as they claimed than they should've been worried about his dead skin cells as they flaked off his body. But like I said at the start of this, this movie just attempted to look good and cared nothing about the story.I can't get over how the movie just seemed to castaway any sense of believability in hopes of thinking the viewer would be dumb enough to buy any of the crud appearing before them. Someone honestly thought that the general public would sit there and ignore everything that didn't make sense and be overpowered with the thoughts of \"that's so cool looking\" when even that wasn't an option.",

            "content": "It is a great movie. A lot of Action. Awesome acting in it. Great Action Movie. It a female empowerment movie. Has a look of fight scene and thrilling scenes. I bought the unrated version and it was Awesome!! It has a video game type scene. I think there 3. Featuring a butt-kicking babe (in this case, the svelte and sexy Milla Jovovich) in a dystopian future, and both specialize in the kind of barely-coherent, video-game storytelling that's constantly overwhelmed by an over-abundance of low-budget CGI. Director Kurt Wimmer fared much better with his earlier film Equilibrium, but he's trying for a lively comic-book vibe here (beginning with Hulk-like opening credits) with a digitally enhanced, Tron-like color palette. It largely suits this late-21st century story of a \"blood war\" between the ultra-violent Violet (Jovovich), member of a vampire-like group of resistance fighters infected with a man-made virus called the Hemophage, and the human Vice Cardinal Daxus (Nick Chinlund), who's determined to eliminate Violet's kind once and for all. Wimmer takes all of this way too seriously, crafting a plot involving Violet's rescue of a human clone boy (Cameron Bright) that's intended as an homage to John Cassevetes' 1980 drama Gloria, but Wimmer's good intentions are mostly lost in a repetitive series of chaotically choreographed fight scenes, mostly involving the tight-bodied Jovovich wiping out dozens of armor-clad enemies. It's all too numbingly hectic to qualify as a satisfying movie, but sci-fi buffs should give it a look anyway, if only to see how locations in Shanghai and Hong Kong contribute to the film's futuristic design.",

            "content": "My first impression of this movie before I watched it was \"It's something like Equilibrium\". At that time, I didn't even know Kurt Wimmer directed Equilibrium. With Milla Jovovich and a Sony Pictures release on its side, I never did expect a big screen movie to be this bad. I feel cheated for buying the DVD, I feel violated by the awful directing, and I feel totally insulted by the computer graphics.Unlike Equilibrium that has a solid (albeit paradoxical) story and a good directing, Ultraviolet looked like a home-made movie by some high-school students on an obsolete PC. It's a futuristic movie; hence the application of computer graphics to generate a futuristic world is extremely important. Yet, they didn't spend any efforts on it. There was no art direction at all. They just design a few futuristic looking building, generate it using computer graphics, and put it there. An artist's paintbrush could produce a better picture. There were absolutely no details. Polygons were just put there. I don't think they even render it! Helicopters and motorcycles look fake when they move, out of proportions when the camera angle changes, and at high speed, the frame rates actually drops to a very visible lag. They didn't even care enough to make sure the bullets don't overlap with the target.The sound effects were so artificial and non-consistent it made me switch off my home theater and watch it solely on the TV's speakers. Gunshots without sound, surround sound where there were not supposed to be, and a total inconsistency of volume leveling throughout the entire film made the DVD a waste of money.Then come the directing. Scenes were done without focus, without objective, and without care. It's not refined and it lacks motivation. Every scene is like a general shot that shows everything. It doesn't capture the objective of the scene, where the focus on a certain angle will tell the viewers what is the intention of the scene, what and where the director wants you to see, and how you should be feeling. This is directing at its worst.Being an action movie laden with martial art fighting sequences, I would expect a level of commitment to the action choreography. The idea of the \"Gun-Kata\" in Equilibrium was very good, very believable. When they reuse it here based on Violet's super-hearing, it's just plain silly. The entire scene was a joke. Yes, my father actually laughed at the scene. When it came to fighting, the scenes were even more absurd. One whoosh and ten guys surrounding Violet goes down to the floor dead. Punches were thrown without aims, and when they do connect, there is no impact. A blade going into the body has no feel to it. Thugs go down with one twist of the arm, and there were hundreds of thugs for Violet to pound on. The piles of bodies on the floor after a fight sequence are absolutely amusing. You would ask at the end of every fight scene where did those bodies come from. There are absolutely no attentions to details in this film! Talking about details, the design of security measures against the HGV is just brainless. You have multiple designs, from a full body suit to a single nose piece. Front-line soldiers wear full body suits. Supervisors wear a transparent face plate that does not cover the entire face, and the scientists wear goggles and mouth-pieces, leaving the nose exposed. When Daxus go outside, he wears only a nose-piece, nothing else. Yet, he has sterile napkins ready to wipe any cups he wishes to use. Did anybody even ask if the coffee was safe?! If you don't think all those are good enough to complain, how about this: he puts his gun in a sterile, vacuum package.Milla Jovovich is a good actress, and this is definitely not one of her best work. Neither is Nick Chinlund. There are just no depths to their characters.The script was not doing any better either. The dialogs in this movie were one of the worst I have ever heard. Violet said \"... a weapon used to kill me and everybody like me\" twice in the movie. It's a little redundant I think, since I am sure by that time we should already know what the story is all about. Then she said: \"I am a titan, a monolith.\" That was the last straw for me.I have never seen a movie as bad as this since Ticker and Unspeakable. My friend bought the DVD together with me. He didn't even finish watching the movie. So for those who are considering this movie, I advise you to save your money, time, and brain cells. I lost half my sanity watching this movie.",

It was a disgrace to the genre, it was a black point for Milla who is a fantastic actress with great physique and style. What struck me was that this movie tried to make a combination of Equilibrium, Matrix, Aeon Flux and Elektra. But these 4 movies are works of art, they are artistic, well-thought, genius movies. This one, on the other hand is pathetic. The effects were cool, I loved them, but a movie is not all about the effects. The storyline was zero, it barely had a subject, and the plot was poor. All the characters lacked depth, their histories were shadowed, their inner feelings, personalities and souls were ignored completely. The film doesn't explain much at all. You see some people interacting with each other and that's it. You take that and leave the cinema disappointed. But these are only half of the problems. I love movies with tough heroes, cool bad guys, obsessed villains, rough criminals, etc. I adore them. But I also like to see and feel these characters. And I want them believable and human. Milla's character lacked any human quality. And the speech she had about her being a titan, bla bla bla, that was so out of place, and it really made her look stupid. One moment she kills everyone, than the second moment she is all maternal and peaceful, or she wants to kill herself. It may seem okay, but if you consider things closely as you watch the movie, it proves to be a huge inaccuracy in the normal way of things. Also, warriors exist, and warriors in movies are always cool. But no one is that perfect, that fast, that resourceful, that damn good. No flaw, no nothing. This was what took credibility from the movie. The dialog is much too poor. It felt as if those lines were just thrown around, without much sense. The battles, I guess were better, but they were fake. Martial arts? No. Cos in martial arts, you get to see and understand the movements. The weapons were cool, very futuristic, but of course, only Milla's. Because all the others couldn't stand a bloody chance. Sword fights should look like art, they should be beautiful first of all. Of course, the purpose of one is to defend yourself and kill the opponent, but this is the outcome, not the entire battle. When I saw Violet standing completely surrounded by soldiers and then, the next second they were all dead, I knew I couldn't expect anything serious. Well, there will be some who will enjoy this film. As I said, the effects are awesome, but a movie also need plot, characters and storyline. Anyone could have made this film if they had enough cash to cover all the blue screens and the tech guys who make the effects. And anyone could have played in it also, cos anyone can look tough and say a few tough lines. But not everyone can make you feel the movie, make you live it.",

Why the hell not? Its like the director is DARING you to say \"absurd\", its so in your face!! It is saying \"look how silly this is\" and \"lets have some fun\" at the same time!! In case any of you forget, even 4 real women at once could not beat up 1 real man. No 125 lb woman with a black belt can defeat a completely untrained 190 lb. man of similar age, so unless you have been watching too much Buffy, remember that a woman that can actually bench press 130 lbs once would be considered to have \"super-strength\" in the real world.That is not to say I don't like the super-powered female fantasy. The only way to outdo it next time is to have Violet blink and thereby take out 100 strong men in a room who were just about to kill her (lol).",

We learn little of her background and never can truly understand what made her go from a nurse to a cold-blooded warrior for her cause so rapidly.

Or if you're desperate for cinematic entertainment, watch Equilibrium instead. Or buy some paint and apply it to a surface and watch it dry, if you must.It made Aeon Flux look like Citizen Kane, put it that way.In fairness to the poor benighted writer/director Kurt Wimmer, his previous outing, Equilibrium, suffered in parts from a similar surfeit of style over content, but had the whole Nineteen Eighty-Four/Farhenheit 451/Brave New World backbone to give it a reasonably coherent storyline. It also had \"real\" actors acquitting themselves well with a half-way decent script.Ultra Violet, on the other hand, has none of these things - Milla Jovovich's legs are very nice, don't get me wrong, and do a splendid job of helping her move around, but what they can't really carry all on their own is a film...dreadful dreadful dialogue, wooden acting, utterly tedious, over-choreographed, and unconvincing fight scenes, and CGI that was obviously way more expensive than it should have been (one particular extended motorbike chase scene was, I think, supposed to be all \"Matrix-y\", but just made me yearn for Tron).Apparently, the studio cut nearly 30 minutes of Wimmer's original script, but it would have to have been pretty amazing to have salvaged the rest of it, and much as I like Equilibrium, I suspect it was a case of a one-trick pony, and the trick really wasn't worth repeating, especially when it was executed so poorly the second time around.Normally I wouldn't care too much, or even bother reviewing it, and just say \"Meh, that was a really crappy movie, next...\" - but in this case I fear for the planet's safety if the collective disgust managed to get harnessed into some form of destructive energy...I have literally never heard so many people laughing out loud in a cinema at things that weren't supposed to be funny.

We weren't disappointed.It had all the earmarks of a stupid movie with a pile of CGI and Milla wandering around with her belly button on display.The body count was absurd. The plot was murky. The action was useful occasionally. The sets were mondo-samey. The weapons were ho-hum. But the acting was magnificent compared to all that. We all know that Milla makes Katherine Hepburn look like Olivier. She spent most of the movie posing like a model, which she is. But she managed to pull an interesting performance out of her butt, and it made an otherwise lackluster film better. The soundtrack was mind-numbingly samey, which is a shame, when you consider that Milla is also a musician. Compared to something like the Matrix, it is a pretty film. The whole resurrection thing is a bit much, but who cares?I got what I wanted out of it. An afternoon with reality on the other side of a door. If I want Citizen Kane, I'll watch Fifth Element again.Thank you and good night.",

If you are making 90 minute music videos adding 2 minutes of explanatory dialogue does not necessarily mean you have a movie.Jovovich's contracts contain \"motivational nudity\" and \"no acting\" clauses rather than the more common \"no nudity\" and \"movitational acting\" clauses. I would like to see the bad movies website review this.Still, loads better than Equilibrium which other people have compared it to, 90 minutes went by very fast, I wouldn't hold out much hope for the director's cut though",

            "content": "Ultraviolet:I rated UV a 5 because I love action movies, but I can't recommend it to people who won't stomach bad kung fu plots just for the kung fu. Frankly, it's disappointing how this movie is actually worse in every respect than the director's previous movie, the greatest gun movie of all time (yes, better than John Woo's Hard Boiled or The Killer), Equilibrium.Action is in many instances identical to that of Equilibrium, and that's the problem. Did the director just use up all of his Gun Kata techniques in Equilibrium and has nothing new for Ultraviolet? But it's worse than that. Equilibrium had better scenes, with much better framing and lighting. Ultraviolet for some reason chooses to hide half the fighting in half or full shadow, jarring everything up with multiple camera cuts per second as if that were somehow the ideal (it's...THE OPPOSITE, MORONS!). And while Equilibrium had that beautiful tai chi sticky-hands with guns showdown at the end, Ultraviolet just has a swordfight with a disappointing ending. But hey, guns and swords! It's actually a lot of fun. In Equilibrium the fighting was cool and stylized, in Ultraviolet it's a little more silly and cartoony. We're expected to believe that, unarmed, she can get 15 trained gangsters to shoot each other just by dodging according to sound and seeing their reflections in each others' sunglasses?Then there's the \"plot.\" While Equilibrium had a serviceable, if uninteresting translation of George Orwell's 1984, Ultraviolet's plot is barely a vehicle to waste time between fight scenes. Rather than parcel out the backstory details bit by bit from various characters where appropriate (as in Equilibrium), Ultraviolet hits you with a boring minute-long narration by the main \"actress.\" UV is set in a world with a disease so bad the infected must be killed to save everyone else, so they revolt...uh...we're supposed to feel sorry for these people? We're supposed to feel they have the right to commit terrorism?! That's like a guy with AIDS claiming he has a right to have condom-free sex without informing his partners. Yeah, we're sorry you're sick, but come on! Then there's the themes. Equilibrium was about the necessity of human emotion, and the main character had to earn his skills in Gun Kata by constant repetition and practice (as shown in a great practice/dialog scene). Ultraviolet is about how terrorism is OK (seriously) but we're never shown how she gets her skills (although she's apparently 100% invincible and unbeatable). Furthermore, Equilibrium's hero didn't need Ultraviolet's antigravity or pocket dimension technology to kick backside. In Equilibrium the bad guys were called Grammaton Clerics (after Tetragrammaton, the 4-letter name of G-d) to show how the society's overemphasis on Reason had become its religion. In Ultraviolet the bad guys' hideout is shaped like a cross and called the Ministry FOR NO APPARENT REASON. Heck, very little in this movie makes sense. Then there's that whole bit right before the big finish where nothing happens and the movie truly drags.The dialogue here is...toerable to silly. There are no great lines or literary references like in Equilibrium's \"You're treading on my dreams!\"Visually, there's nothing new here (a remix of Equilibrium's black-clad jackbooted thugs and Minority Report's clean \"whiteness\") except for the way the character's clothes and hair change color for no explained reason. The director even uses the same cool fractal-style muzzle flash from the automatic machine pistols.I guess it sounds like I'm coming down a little hard on Ultraviolet. If you like silly action movies, you'll like this one, but I'd still say Equilibrium is better. Hopefully we'll see something great out of this director next time, because he does have potential. Just hire a real writer next time.",

Violet when on a mission to recover a weapon from the humans looks inside to reveal a human child. As the movie goes on it is just her trying to protect it. This is one of Milla Jojovich less appealing movies (probably the best one was the Fifth Element) and I was disappointed after seeing this right after I saw the trailer which I had hoped that this would be a good action movie. Which it isn't and is a complete ripoff of moves from other action movies.(but i do have to give credit for some good moves).

I can accept that UltraViolet has super powers to some degree, but they don't have to be ridiculous with her abilities, unless they want to retitle the movie Superwoman. I was done with this movie when she was surrounded by the armed Asian gang.

From director Kurt Wimmer, the guy behind the surprisingly pretty OK Equilibrium, comes one of the largest wastes of potential since\u0085 well, since a long time ago.Feast your eyes on Ultraviolet! This sci-fi story follows the war between humans and vampires. Excuse me, I mean the war between humans and Hemophages, people genetically modified thanks to a virus.Our main character Violet just happens to be one of these Hemophages, and she is fighting the humans to keep herself and others like her from facing extermination.Sound very original? No? Okay so the premise isn't great, but at least the movie looks cool.Although clearly produced on a limited budget, with some of the cityscapes looking suspiciously like those of a computer game, the mix of vibrant colors and creative set design creates an interesting cinematic world that is as visually stimulating as something like Sin City.The action is also well conceived, at least for the first half of the film. The futuristic setting offers a lot of cool gadgets, and they are used well. The \"glass soldiers\" that are featured prominently in the trailer are especially innovative. Instead of simply dying they shatter.Sadly, pretty much everything underneath the superficial skin of Ultraviolet is passionless and incomprehensible.The two biggest problems: dialogue and acting. Here we have bad actors delivering stale lines.Even though Milla Jovovich has proved that she can act from time to time, she is here only as eye candy. With this said, the unnatural smoothness of her face becomes distracting.None of the supporting characters are any better, too, with Nick Chinlund (bounty hunter Toombs from The Chronicles of Riddick) delivering the definition of a phoned in performance.Even if the script had any emotional weight, which it doesn't, the acting alone would kill any actual sentiment.Worse, the dialogue continually gets worse and worse, so that by the end it becomes impossible to take seriously. There is a scene where a character removes his glove slowly, uttering, \"It's on.\" No, for our sake, please turn it off.Did this just become a parody? The worst thing about Ultraviolet, though, is the fact that it becomes hard to ever care about anything or anyone. The entire back story is delivered so quickly that there is no connection to the world or the individuals that inhabit it.Unlike a film such as The Matrix, the premise is not revealed slowly with any hint of mystery, and there are no individualistic or identifiable characters. As cool as Ultraviolet looks, it never feels like a place that could be real, and the struggles of Violet herself seem just as artificial.Yet, it appears that director Wimmer is aware of his creative downfalls, and he saves the truly atrocious moments for last.Still, for those who are convinced that the pretty colors and flashing lights of Ultraviolet are worth the price of admission, there is one quote from the film that is actually perfect: \"Are you mental?\" Critic's Conclusion: Despite the stylish packing, Ultraviolet is an empty, shallow work of derivative sci-fi trash. Only for hardcore lovers of the material, otherwise: avoid, like a deadly viral infection.",

The bad guys here never get any better though: they're just moving meat to dull Violet's blade as she adopts every cool fighting pose in the book. The head bad guy is pretty insipid, and the kid everyone is after will remind everyone who watches of the kid at school who is always getting bullied and picked on.

I was looking for the unrated extended version but couldn't. I don't think it would have helped any. Steer very clear of this movie because it sucks that bad. The acting, dialogue, plot, special effects, it's all just so horrible. I really tried to give it a chance but I had to turn it off after about 15 or 20 minutes. Couldn't take anymore.When it starts, the style is like live-action anime but they're trying too hard. It's unrealistic. The theme is never fully explained as the movie progresses. Dialogue is drab, lifeless, and like a bad comic book. The special effects are high end in too few places and low end in way too many as this movie tries to blend cgi and live-action. Not like hybrid flicks like Alvin and the Chipmunks but really tries to transplant real people and backgrounds with cgi thinking the viewer won't know the difference but it's so obvious. You don't know if it's a digital world or the real world because it's never explained. Things just happen with no explanation as to how or what they are. It's just a bad, bad, bad movie. And the music sucks too. It's like something you'd hear in a low end Saturday morning action cartoon.About the only cool thing about the flick is the tech. I did like the anti-gravity belt but when it was used, they kept going the anime route by showing it charge up each time it was used. The first time I can understand. Anything after that is wasted screen time. Fight scenes were incredibly over-choreographed. Movement and flow wasn't natural. It was more along the lines of PG-13 comic violence but on the lower end of the scale. I ain't got much good to say about this movie. I give it 2 out of 10 stars. Watch it for the tech ideas because there is other cool stuff but don't expect to enjoy the ride.",

Aeon Flux. And that wasn't even that great. But when it is compared to Violet, it seems like the perfect movie. Aeon Flux had substance and a semi-decent story, whereas Ultraviolet is just senseless fighting and really, really bad dialogue.The only good thing about Ultra-whatever is the fighting. It had very cleverly choreographed fight scenes. But even this couldn't make up for it. Some of the scenes in this movie have no point whatsoever. I think that the worst part of this movie was dialogue. if you don't have good dialogue, there isn't much of a movie. Lines like, \"Are you mental?\" or \"You got hemo blood on me\" were just a few of the bad, bad lines.Milla Jovovich and Cameron Bright are both very disappointing in this movie. I thought that Milla was capable of better. I am also angry that William Fitchner accepted to be in such a terrible movie. i generally think he's a good actor.Bottom line: Bad movie, don't see it.

I think the overdose of CGI was intentional to create this sort of half comic book- half reality atmosphere which i thought was pretty cool, but the story and character development simply weren't good enough to go with it. Add the prosaic,corny dialogue and this movie ended up being kind of lousy. Too bad because it had potential.For the hot chick heroine sci-fi genre, i thought Aeon Flux which came out around the same time was better.",

The movie is filled with violence and it is difficult to determine what is really bad and what is truly good. The audience is left to determine that for themselves. Did you see this movie? Do you understand? Violet (Milla Jojovich),lives in a futuristic world. The world, it seems, has regressed to a to a point much like what I would describe as a communistic police powered government, ruled by one man, Daxus (Nick Chinlund). Violet is on a mission to save a young boy, Six (Camaron Bright). Violet and many like her are afflicted with a disease called Hemophagia. Six carries an antigen in his blood that could save those afflicted with this disease which has consumed the world. Violet stills the boy and in the process battles many soldiers of the government. \"One woman against fourteen men. Ridiculous\", Daxus angrily states. Violet fights fourteen men in one battle and she gets everyone of them. She walks away with her life and that of the boy. Daxus seems consumed on growing things within his domain and how one came to possess their special attributes. Ultraviolet is a violent movie. I found a great deal of emotion in the film. After viewing this movie several times, I am still not sure if I understand the entire film. I do believe it has a great deal of meaning for those with the mind to understand. What drives the human psyche within the human mind and what makes us do those things which we sometimes do? Unlike some of my fellow commenters, I give this movie a nine. I enjoyed the romanticism placed within this violent society of the damned.",

So nothing exciting there.The movie was overly stylized, and there was no logical reason for it. From a style standpoint, think Kill Bill + Sin City. The fight scenes are all very stylistic; You'll see no blood, and they are intentionally made to look staged in many cases, almost like play fighting. It is interesting, but boring. Also these fight scenes are over so quick, Violet simply spins around and everyone is dead, then she moves on.There are some interesting metaphors in the movie, primarily relating to religion, in a sort of Orwellian fashion.If your a Milla Jovivich fan, You'll give it a shot, just like I did...

            "content": "It's my opinion that Ultraviolet is a very under rated movie. I love the visual look of the movie with the color changing suits. Usually futures in sci-fi movies are dark. This one is not. Also bio-hazard sign shaped gun flames! That is awesome. The acting is decent. I have seen much worse and people don't whine. Especially Nick Chinlund is great and menacing as Daxus. One of my favorite bad guys now. Definitely better than Equilibriums Dupont. The fight scenes are good and better than in many movies. They are however not Equilibrium quality. Violet uses gun-kata which is not explained in the movie so I believe people have trouble grasping it. It's not 100% realistic? It's not meant to be! This is a fantasy movie. It's meant to look cool. Also who cares are the gadgets realistic? This is a fantasy movie in the future. The only problem I have with the action scenes is that the soldiers seem to die when Violet breaks their arm or something. There isn't much of a plot and sometimes the story can seem a bit strange but with the additional scenes of the unrated edition it feels a bit less hollow. Also the characters of Violet and Six feel more complete and the transition between one particular scene doesn't feel so awkward anymore after the slight additional character development. People don't get why Six doesn't die. It's actually the only part of the movie where you have to think for yourself. So yeah, I like Ultraviolet and the reasons are 1. great visual look of the movie 2. good action scenes 3. great bad guy and even some great dialogue and funny parts. I can't understand how some people can prefer the lame Aeon Flux over Ultraviolet. Ultraviolet is fancy looking sci-fi action masturbation but that's all it wishes to be. It doesn't want to be the Godfather or Citizen Kane.",

I read that the studio didn't like the final cut and re-edited it from two hours to less than ninety minutes. This \u2013 apparently \u2013 made it more 'action orientated,' taking out the emotion and storytelling aspects of the tale. The tale. It's set in the future during a war between humans and vampires (although they're called 'hemo-phages' or something).Mila Jovovich plays the titular character who's a vampire (I'm just going to call them vampires from now on), intent on stopping the 'evil' humans from wiping her kind out. However, when she's ordered to kill a child, crucial to the wicked humans' plans, she refuses and turns on... well, pretty much everyone.It's never really explained how Violet gets her \u2013 borderline superhuman \u2013 powers. She seems to find it pretty easy to wipe out huge armies of armed soldiers without breaking sweat. She just does. It's things like this, not to mention a few blatantly humorous lines, that make me wonder whether this film was supposed to be a bit 'tongue-in-cheek.' However, there's not enough humour in it to really show that it's supposed to not be taken seriously. For the most part it's played straight, forcing you to suspend your disbelief more than you ever have in order to believe what's happening before your eyes.But it's not all bad. Despite the new Playstation 2 special effects (seriously... some of the backdrops look like they're straight out of a computer game's 'cut scenes'), the sets are actually quite well-designed and colourful. It certainly does have its own 'look' and is quite atmospheric when it's at its best.I wonder whether Ultraviolet was supposed to be the start of some sort of franchise that never took off \u2013 something like the Resident Evil or Underworld series. Basically, it could have been at least fun, if it knew what it was. But the plot is just 'tell not show.' The characters say things that are blatantly there to just let us \u2013 the audience \u2013 know what's happening. The fight scenes are cool and Milla is possibly even sexier than ever. So, if all you're looking for is hot girls killing hordes of bad-guys then you'll find what you're looking for here. Anything deeper and you'll be left wanting more. Much, much more.",

            "content": "30 July 2006. Of the three recent vampire movies, Ultraviolet compared to BloodRayne and UnderworldEvolution, Ultraviolet maintains an adequate level of realism, consistent plot line, and interesting pacing and acting to make this the only viewable movie straight through. Not without its flaws and imperfection, Ultraviolet begins with a rather amazing THX-1138 (1971) feel, look, and sci-fi originality that rapidly wears off in the first 15-minutes to be replaced by a Tron (1982) and Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (2001) look and feel that unfortunately doesn't bode well in the special effects department. There is too much of this movie that looks artificial and unreal, distracting the audience from the real action. It's likely that either not enough money was available for special effects or that the producers/directors wanted too much, too soon for the current technology. Commendable though the look and architecture (Shanhai) is quite exciting in this movie and the color is similar to the original Batman (1989) or even Dick Tracy (1990) but in a more brighter and futurist way. Much of the movie though takes from Kill Bill Vol. 1 (2003) and while some of the martial arts is neat, it seems excessively unnecessary or over the top. Overall, this is the best of the vampire movies (though the vampires in this movie are so unlike vampires as to lose their actual identity as anymore more than different species of man. Yet, this venture into sci-fi, martial arts, vampirism doesn't quite gel into what its potential could have been. There are the tender moments, the usual twists, with an adequate ending, but never really makes it into greatness. The characters gyrate but never become more than their source material from a comic-book. Six out of Ten Stars.",

In the future a virus has affected a certain portion of the populace, turning them essentially into vampires, with enhanced reflexes and strength, but without the bloodlust and simultaneously drastically reducing their lifespan. But now there's talk about a cure being found.From that you can probably surmise that originality is not this movie's strong point. We've seen these types of rebel stories set in the future before, even some with vampires in them. We all know the drill. Big megacorporations are evil, advanced medical technologies rule the earth, everyone wears sunglasses all the time, malls are even shinier than today, cars are cool beyond belief, motorbikes as well, every single surface looks like it was designed by Apple and\u0085 you know the gist of it.What Ultraviolet gets right are the visuals and the action scenes. Especially the first third of the film is supremely slick-looking, with amazing, vibrant colours, smooth designs and good camera angles. Very pleasing to watch. The action scenes as well, fully taking advantage of the \"vampires are combat machines\" trope to give us some completely over the top, but cooler than absolute zero fight scenarios.Unfortunately, the rest is not so impressive. The characters are cardboard cutouts with no defined motives, backstories or characteristics. The kid character is especially annoying, pointless and played by a boy, who doubtlessly tries his hardest, but just isn't very convincing. The story is equally bland, riddled with clich\u00e9s and about as interesting as any other B-grade vampire film you've ever seen. Which is to say, not very.Ultraviolet is by no means the worst vampire film I've ever seen. The only problem is, the vampire thing is completely superfluous to its general idea, and said general idea is merely something we've already seen done far better in numerous other films. Check it out if you're really into stylistic scifi action films. Otherwise don't bother.",

The filming style was disturbing, flashing between video game-like quality to live action, to animation, and back again. It could have been well done, and tried, but not quite hard enough.

If you take it as a Comic-book movie there is a lot of action and tons of special effects. Make it a bbn (Block Buster Night)... Take it from E. Sparks! My only complaint is more of a rhetorical question as to where this movie is geared. I am not going to give anything away but there were a lot of instances where if I was a little boy around 7-8yr old. I would just watch the movie and scream COOOOOOLLLL.

And indeed it was exactly what I thought it would be: a 'nifty' prolonged intro of an action video-game.The story line is no more complicated than those of video games, and somehow the characters and emotional bonds between them are just as flat. I'm not saying the acting is bad, especially Jovovich's, but there's just so much to act on - practically nothing. The film-makers imagination of this logic-defying futuristic world is childishly 'cool', but it's nothing at all scientific or believable for anyone over 12. And 'realistic' would be the last word I use to describe this film, so I won't even go into that. As I sat there through the mind numbing action sequences, one following another, I kept thinking: what a male fantasy flick this is...And sadly that's the best part of the film. Ultraviolet is exemplary hot and sexy, and she blatantly exploits that with midriff-baring tight outfits. Jovovich did the action sequences very good too, and looked very good all through the film. This would work better as a visual leaf of her modelling portfolio than it does as a film.And, although this created world is pretty cool for what it is, some visual effects look a bit rough, making it even less believable than it already is. In every sci-fi film it's necessary to make a 'believable' world albeit very different than our own, with its own logic and all, but this film can't even do that. At least, I wasn't convinced; I wasn't taken into the world for the duration of the film.But hey, it was everything I expected. And it's not that bad for being what it is. Preteen boys would enjoy this most, I reckon.",

Acting is remarkably terrible you dread whatever is to follow whenever a character opens their mouth (thankfully its rare enough) and the plot is just non existent. Now, this is an action movie, so aside from the plot and acting lets talk about the fighting and the special effects. The special effects were basically similar to the junk i used to make on Bryce 5.5. I was hysterically laughing when they switched gravity modes to left and right, never mind how impossible that is- it was poorly executed, and the fight scenes were a pathetic rip on Kill Bill (and so was the main character.., except they make her purple in this movie instead of yellow). One fight scene she uses an Jamaican guys dread locks to strangle/whip him (it wasn't very clear) and others they simply turn the lights off and play some sound effects. Most people in the theater were laughing out loud and many just walked out. The bad guys looked like world war one - rubber masked soldiers and the bad guys building (the bad guy had two metal speakers stuffed in his nostrils so you could tell he didn't mean any good) was shaped like a cross. The doors between the rooms of lame fight scenes were also shaped like crosses. Hopefully this movie is trying to put in some symbolism with this but honestly thats a real stretch...",

But that is what i love about it. The movie has a ton of great action sequences and all of it is color coordinated. the devices Violet uses is a little far fetched but they are SO cool, i mean a 0 gravity device used to ride a motorcycle on walls, now thats cool. Even though i pointed out some of the flaws, yes it has more, that is what makes it unique. It feels like a sci-fi movie from the seventies and i loved that feeling. Some of the lines were also so funny it sometimes felt like a satire of action movies.

When the authorities try to stem the tide of said disease she rebels and wants to go on spreading her cute infection and kills all who try to keep her and her ilk from spreading the contagion (more or less on purpose). It's like fighting the CDC when they try to stop you from spreading Ebola.Of course it then is revealed that the powers that be don't want to stop the disease from the kindness of their hearts and so Milla must kill even more.That's the plot.The fights and action scenes are utterly boring and predictable because Milla's character (like virtually all Stephen Seagal characters, hence the reference above) is utterly invincible and no enemy comes even remotely close to ever standing a chance of harming her.The main character herself is just annoying, arrogant and self-centered. There is really not a single likable character in the entire movie, much less even remotely interesting.Special effects are plentiful yet dull and uninspired.Acting is wooden. From Milla this is hardly a surprise since she cannot act at all but I had expected at least a symbolic efforts from the rest of the cast. Or at least the extras.Summary:1: The plot is dumb.2: No interesting characters. At all.3: Acting is wooden yet hammy.4: Special effects do nothing to contribute to this film.I give it a 1 on the IMDb-scale because it's not worth anything better.

            "content": "Let me start by saying I just adore Milla. I'd watch her paint a room and be fascinated by it. I've loved her since I first discovered her, during the Beavis & Butthead days and hers was one of the video clips they were lampooning on their TV. I immediately bought her CD (pretty good - check it out!) and have enjoyed every minute of her singing, modeling, & acting ever since. Even her L'Oreal commercials make me smile - she's a delight in most everything she does.Now, for this movie. The premise is a bit daunting - there's this pseudo-underworld of amped up uber vampires called \"Hemophages\" that don't consume blood, as theirs is a genetic mutation which is contagious to humans, so they're avoided and ostracized at all costs.It seems these infected folks have higher levels of strength & senses, making them faster & better able to avoid or defeat humans whenever necessary. It also seems that they have 007's arsenal of ultra weaponry available to them, yet none seem to have a job. Go figure. Now there is information that an anti-virus is about to be unleashed upon their species for their eradication. Obviously, the infected wish to survive so they attempt to stop the human invasion before the anti-virus can be released into the atmosphere (seeing tones of RE in this movie?).Well, let's just say that it all goes horribly and inexplicably wrong, otherwise there wouldn't be much of a movie, now would there? :) Milla's \"Violet\" is the ultra assassin sent in to retrieve the anti-virus, single handedly, even though there is a cachet of these equally-skilled vampires that could have assisted her. Her task is \"simple\", otherwise - get in, get the anti-virus, get out. Let the mayhem of bullets & sword fighting begin! I could delve further into this movie, but you've seen it elsewhere before. What is presented here is a Frankestein's monster of similarly-themed movies (see my title), sewn together in an unimpressive fashion in this reviewer's opinion.The special effects are quite good, most of the time, but suddenly have an 80's quality to them on occasion. Violet's hair abruptly changes color and apparently for no reason, as she can be walking when it turns from jet black to platinum pink - this doesn't seem to be related to emotions or rage, just random & odd. Likewise, her clothes often change colors and it just seems to be for the effect of changing her clothes colors - nothing more.I was disappointed that at times Milla's face was the porcelain doll quality that we're used to seeing and then in the next frame or close up, we're treated to her sans makeup (or possibly WITH some purposed defect makeup) with facial splotches showing. This happens several times throughout the movie. Also disappointing was how one moment she's in a car watching a fireworks display, then she's in a lab, then back in the same car. Um...??? And then there's getting shot in the heart, dying as a result & surrounded by your pursuers, and then waking up after heart surgery in your almost-boyfriend's lab. Uh...??? Now lets jump off the gurney & go kick summore butt RIGHT NOW! Bah.All in all this movie is a stinker, but Milla is superb as always. She comes to the table and satisfies, otherwise this movie would be unwatchable if she was not in it. See it only if you enjoy Milla's work, a mind-numbing amount of Xbox 360-caliber CGI, mindless & repetitive action sequences full of \"martial arts\", guns spewing bullets incessantly or occasionally a huge explosion.",

            "content": "OK, I actually liked this movie, and the truth is I usually hate these sci-fi heroine movies. AeonFLUX, Resident Evil, Underworld, Tomb Raider\u0085I think these movies lack characterization, good writing, acting, and relatable characters. Had it not been for the fact that UltraViolet was directed by Kurt Wimmer, the genius behind Equilibrium, I would have saved my money on this movie since the premise seemed pretty bad.The story is terrible, even though I like this idea of a medical-based police state. The background is the same we've seen from similar movies: Super bad-ass race of \"vampires\" who have the power to make crazy action scenes versus a dystopian government run by humans. The protagonist is not only a sexy, fashionably dressed female buttkicker, but she's a bereaved parent who acts as a protective surrogate mother to a child. Yes, this is one hackneyed plot tool after another, and Wimmer even steals a twist from his own Equilibrium (the bad guy turns out to be a bad-ass buttkicker, too!). When it's not clich\u00e9, it's ludicrous. In one scene, Violet encounters some Chinese men and gets in a fight with them\u0085.for no apparent reason; the movie makes absolutely no effort explain this scene's existence. Also the final twist is very silly. A lot of the blame goes to Wimmer for coming up with a stupid idea for a movie, but Screen Gems cut the movie from two hours to less than one and a half. Knowing them, most of this was probably character development.That's the bad stuff, now I'm going to explain why I actually liked this movie. Most importantly, this movie has what most of these movies lack: a protagonist who comes off as relatable, vulnerable human being. In Equilibrium, Wimmer proved that he can do well with a movie's human element, and he that he can get good performances from his actors. Most of these heroine movies lack any good performances, regardless of the actress's talents, but Milla Jovovich does very well in this movie and gives a nuanced performance. Violet shows little originality, but she's a well-executed and believably flawed character. Her humanity comes out in sometimes humorous ways when she reacts with frustration to Six's na\u00efve and sometime self-destructive behavior. The composition of the movie seemed like a mess in the theatre, but Violet's motivation and character are more understandable in the unrated DVD, which adds crucial backstory. William Fichtner and a sinister, raspy-voiced Nick Chinlund give great performances. Cameron Bright does a decent job for someone his age, but everyone else in the movie is rubbish. The only bad actor in it who plays a big enough role for it to matter is the French Guy; he's terrible and he sounds like the narrator from Spongebob Squarepants, but it's not like he's any worse than Viktor from UnderWorld or the German accent guy from Resident Evil 2. Chinlund's Daxus provides what most of these movies also lack: a cool bad guy. However, it seems he cares more about medical sanitation than gun safety, as he keeps locked and loaded Berettas in sterilized baggies.The dialogue in the movie ranges from good to amusingly campy to just bad. Many lines do deliver on the emotionality. Other lines are great campy one-liners that are enhanced by their deliveries by Jovovich and Chinlund. It's not on the level of \"Army of Darkness,\" but it's fun and fitting for the type of movie it is. Other lines include bad expository dialogue (we are introduced to Daxus as he is being told stuff he always knows by an underling). Although I wouldn't call the movie intelligent, I do agree with the pro-life stance it seems to take when Violet gets in a conversationally impossible argument with a bad guy.Now for the eye candy. Another reason I don't like these types of movies is that the fight scenes are usually not worth sitting through the movie. The action scenes in UltraViolet are every bit as original and innovative as the plot isn't. The editing in a few action sequences is choppy, includes bad zooms, and skips the connections of many a blow, but Wimmer's talent for choreography is still apparent despite Screen Gems' meddling. In one scene Violet beats up a group of guards, shattering their armor like glass, in another scene she fights guards with a pair of submachine guns with katana blades coming from the bottom of the grips. So if you read a review by someone who likes bad action movies by directors with two middle initials who can't choreograph a decent fight scene to change their lives, and he tells you this movie has hackneyed fight scenes, he's friggin' lying to you.The visual style is very dazzling, with bold colors and a beautiful soft-focus effect. The soft-focus is actually a pet peeve among many viewers, but I think it enhances the futuristic look. CGI is crude, but fitting considering the type of movie it is. Klaus Badelt provides a fitting techno/classical/metal score, but the introduction has a shameful rip-off of the Spiderman theme. Still, right after that you're treated the coolest opening shot since Episode III. Costume design is stylish, and Violet looks sexy despite a garish, curve-hiding bare belly. Also, there are many clever technological gadgets in the movie. I almost feel bad giving this movie such a high rating, but it's a silly movie in a silly genre. The bottom line is that Ultraviolet isn't great, but it's good, silly fun. It may have a pretty low rating on IMDb, but that's probably because some of the people who went to see it are Equilibrium fans who expected another great movie from the director. Most of the others have AeonFLUX on DVD, so their opinion doesn't matter. I'd say it is by far Screen Gems' most watchable movie.Hopefully, Wimmer will get a chance from some studio make a better movie on par with Equilibrium.",

Watching guys shatter as they were hit was unusual and creative. Watching Violet's clothes and hair change color regularly was lots of fun. The action scenes however unrealistic were exciting to watch as long as you understood you were \"watching\" a comic book and not expecting an unbiased news report (as if THAT exists) and the soundtrack was killer. Bottom line, it was cool and I enjoy watching it from time to time. As a used DVD it was an investment. Even had I spent full price at the theater I would have been happy.",

Saying that, i would hope the character(s) she plays have a good story to it. (Like Resident evil) Sad to say that's not the case in this film.WARNING: THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILER(s). YOU HAVE BEEN WARNEDSo the trailer/teaser suggest that milla is this renegade woman who takes on a lot of baddies in a cybernetic world with the saying, \"..I come from a world you may not understand..\" Truth be told she wasn't lying. (laughs lightly) This film centered mostly on 'six', a kid whose blood can kill off jovovich's race of super enhanced humans. Then the film gets more complicated with jovovich juggling back and forth on whether or not to save the kid or simply kill him. Then you got her character who can kick anyone's ass not matter the numbers they come in. For example there's a scene where 'six' is held hostage against her renegade comrades. There must've been at least 6 guys that charge at her and she just swings her sword at them and they all fall backwards dead. *tsk* okay, we get that jovovich's character is a bad ass but come on...a bit of realism wouldn't hurt anyone. Needless to say the story wasn't as interesting as jovovich's character and fight scenes. The fight scenes were especially interesting as well as motivating for me not to leave the theater. She does kick ass in scenes like in the library where she fights off a bunch of soldiers and before that entering a room where soldiers are armed with swords. Overall the film get 5/10 only because for me the entertainment was met. It had humor, action, and a character that kept the film going, somewhat. (jovovich's character mainly.) So check out the film if your into fast action and fun. Keep in mind, there's no real story here, just enough for action though.",

            "content": "Seeing the trailer for this sci-fi flick early in 2006 on TV, shortly before it came into theatres, it looked like a film I would want to see. I might have ended up going to see it in the theatre if it wasn't for the fact that I looked on IMDb while it was in theatres, and noticed the rating was quite low. Two years later, I see \"Ultraviolet\" still has a low rating, but I rented it to see for myself how bad it was. Well, I can say with no doubt in my mind that I do not agree with those who think it's terrible, I've definitely seen much worse movies (like the last one I saw before this, \"Freddy Got Fingered\"), but it's still a rather awkward one.Late in the 21st Century, certain scientific research has lead to a disease spreading around the world, creating a subculture of humans with special powers, known as the \"Hemophages!\" These individuals have special powers, ones which resemble those of vampires, and they are separated from the rest of the world's population. The world is ruled by Daxus (also ruled by fear and totalitarianism), who leads a war against the Hemophages, and is determined to have them wiped out! Violet is a woman who has been infected with the disease, and is part of an underground resistance movement formed by Hemophages. She is on a mission to find a secret weapon, a weapon that turns out to be a nine-year-old boy named Six. She must protect this child from the government, who plan to kill him, as he is said to be a threat to humans. This mission involves Violet having to single-handedly take on many enemies! I'm sure many other guys would agree that Milla Jovovich in the starring role as Violet, in tight clothing and a belly shirt, and with her martial arts moves, is a major highlight. However, there aren't too many highlights other than that. At approximately ninety minutes, \"Ultraviolet\" is pretty short when it comes to the standards of blockbusters these days, and seems like it was rushed. The cinematography is rather weak, jumping from scene to scene too quickly, and without very impressive camera angles (sometimes a little too close up, if I remember correctly). The film may also overdo it a bit with the special effects at times, and I would say the story is sometimes a bit confusing and hard to follow, which may not have been the case had they made it longer (maybe around two hours long) and more focused. I did find some parts exciting, but looking back, it still pretty much seems like a bunch of nonsense. So, while I don't hate \"Ultraviolet\" like some do, it sure could have used a bit more effort.",

Equilibrium was a first-rate action movie. The only thing I asked for out of this movie was for it to be an Equilibrium clone.Well, it tried to be, but it certainly wasn't. First of all, the action sequences seem so weak in this movie. Milla Jovovich just isn't up to the action sequences in this movie. Some of them had some definite potential, and one or two rise to the awesomeness of Equilibrium. The rest, the settle for mediocrity (at best), or they are just cop-outs (one swing of her sword takes out a dozen enemies). The movie also relies on gimmicky tools that are not used throughout the entire movie; honestly, it made me think of MacGyver.Aside from that, the plot was completely illogical. My head hurt after watching this movie, because Milla Jovovich is so terrible at her speaking parts, and the plot makes so little sense as it is, that when I'm not watching the mediocre action sequences, I'm being tortured by awful acting.Finally, even more so than Equilibrium, Wimmer saturates Ultraviolet with anti-Catholic (and more generally anti-religious) ideas. The bad guy in Equilibrium was called Father, and his followers clerics. Now, the bad guy is the Vice Cardinal, one of the government organizations he leads is called the Latter-Day something or other (I don't remember the exact name), he works at the Archministry, the ministry building is shaped like a giant cross, and there are crosses everywhere in the movie. Of course, Wimmer also uses religious imagery in a positive light sometimes, so it really doesn't make any sense.This movie had some redeeming sequences, but overall, it is a waste of money.",

It's a movie, and it's not actually real.Let's be fair, I did not actually think this movie was a life changing event. I can't say what I was expecting from the movie before I actually bought it (Five Bucks at wallieworld)but I thought it would be interesting (ok, I liked the cover). It does have some pretty cool effects and the fighting sequences were also rather clever up to a point. However, as pretty as Milla is, the problem that most negative reviewers seem to have with this movie is they seem unable (or unwilling) to separate her character as played on screen AKA UltraViolet from those others she has played in the past which they might have liked much better for different reasons...which seems a bit unfair. There is not an excessive amount of blood and entrails splattered all over the screen, nor an army of lunatic zombies roaming the streets searching for hapless victims to feed upon. It's a simple story of a totalitarian state in the near distant future where thanks to the wonders of technology, a deadly virus a lab was trying to eradicate is (suprise) made ten times worse and gets out into the open where it mutates. Those infected become Hemophages and require frequent transfusions to stay alive. They are also just called vampires since one of the side effects of infection is the elongation of the persons front teeth in a very vampire like way, and becoming sensitive to light. They do become amped in their sensory abilities sight, and hearing and there strength is also vastly increased. But there's a catch (as always) it dramatically shortens your lifespan to twelve years from infection to last exhalation. (yeah, life stinks, even in the movies. Violet who is infected infiltrates a top research laboratory under the guise of a courier to deliver a package to another lab. She is scanned several times from the point of entry to her actually receiving the package, which she is told forbidden to look at. She is also given the delightful news that she only has nine hours to get the package there or it will explode...and needless to her as well. All is going to plan until the actual courier sent to pick up the package gets there, and things get complicated very very quickly. As Violet pulls weapons out of thin air (or rather using thin space technology) she fights her way out of the lab and through various other scenes of street mayhem. Fast forward a bit to where she is delivering the package to the people to whom she is working...other hemophages searching for a cure. On the elevator to the floor where they are located her curiosity gets the better of her and she sneaks a peek at the contents, and is stunned to find a full grown child within. (that wacky thin space technology again). Knowing that this is not a good thing considering where she is going and the likely outcome, she devises a ruse of her own to protect the child's life should they go the way she thinks they might...which they do. So now she has two groups of people after her and who want the child for very different reasons but which are not good for the other side. I will leave it at that point, since if you want to see the movie, no sense in telling you everything. And If you don't want to see it by reading previous reviews written by others I can't change your mind anyway. I will say that for what it is, this is not a bad film... there are other examples that are far worse and do not work as well or look nearly as cool as this does. It's your expatiation's that need to be realistic. It's NOT the Matrix, and it does not pretend that it's anything else.

Naturally, things aren't all as they seem.Kurt Wimmer, in making his cult hit \"Equilibrium,\" was riding on two fine sets of wheels back then. A story telling set and an action making set. With this follow up it seems that story telling set has stopped spinning, but he kept on going before winding up on half-power at some uninteresting results.Visually and action wise this film is quite enjoyable at first but you quickly see how much effort the film puts into outrunning itself. Desperately trying to top \"Equilibrium\" with gravity defying (literally) stunts and waves of balletic fight scenes/shootouts, \"Ultraviolet\" ultimately forgets to tell a decent story. It all boils down to a generic conspiracy story without a shred of new flavor. The special effects also boil down to fairly lame computer generated cotton candy, though some of the landscape shots of the futuristic city are nice. Though that'll only be the case if you're a sucker for landscape. I am, so the film had me entertained pleasantly, in a few establishing/wide shots.The rest is undeniably stylish and even promising, but the sloppy presentation hardly does it justice. Then the lack of dramatic elements make it all dull. Milla Jovovich in sleek costumes is the only real plus and ultimately that is what makes the film watchable. --- 5/10Rated PG-13 for violence",

I mean, it even has what is essentially the Tetragrammaton, except Wimmer changed the symbol from a quasi-swastika to a biohazard symbol and a crucifix/caduceus hybrid. From the Equilibrium DVD commentary, I knew that there was going to be *one* scene like that (which I was looking forward to), but I had no idea that *all* of them would be.The other 1/3 is dialog that has to be the most ham-handed scriptwriting I've ever seen acted out on screen. Especially the \"smack talk\" that introduces the action scenes. The writers even stole some of it from *other* movies! The \"you're all going to die\" line that they swiped from The Crow stuck in my head the most, but I noticed others too.The CGI is all over the place as well. Some of it looks like the makers were aiming for photorealism, some looks like an attempt to create a comic-book look, and some looks like untextured pre-visualization footage that wasn't finished in time for the release.I was especially annoyed about the vampire aspect. I mean, not only did it not make any sense or add anything to the story (to the point that it's not even mentioned in the previews I saw), but it meant having those absolutely stupid-looking fangs on William Fichtner. I mean seriously, did they source those from a 25-cent toy vending machine or what? And do the people involved know *just* how hard it is to get me to say that vampires shouldn't be in a film? The vampire factor in Ultraviolet is only exceeded in terms of badness by Blade 3 and Embrace of the Vampire.The saddest thing is that it had *so* much going for it, just like the Star Wars prequels:Gun-kata - Awesome visual design - Klaus Badelt's excellent soundtrack - The hyper-dimensional weapons, even if the swords were obviously there so Kurt Wimmer could make what is essentially a lightsaber fight video - Milla Jovovich - Milla Jovovich looking like a rivethead - Milla Jovovich doing her best impression of Christian Bale as Cleric John Preston - William Fichtner - The \"post-collapse\" writing styleIt would have been rad if Wimmer had made it as an Equilibrium sequel. Instead of vampires, there could have been Clerics - relics of a previous time, who were being hunted down by the majority of the population who decided to stop taking Prozium and wanted to ensure that everything the Tetragrammaton represented was wiped out. It would probably have ended up as a 90-minute Klaus Badelt music video starring Milla Jovovich and a cast of thousands of guns and swords, but that's more or less what the parts of Ultraviolet that aren't awful add up to.",

I felt the other way around. While this movie was bad, it was still way above the horrid \"Aeon Flux\".There are several reasons why this movie failed. I won't comment on the fact that many people have said that director Kurt Wimmer's vision was compromised by the production company, that his ideas would have made a far better movie. The problem with that is that there is so much wrong with this movie that i think it unlikely that even the producers could have messed it up so bad without help from the director. And to be fair much of what was seen in Equilibrium still exists here. The difference is that in Equilibrium the lavish visual style worked well, here it doesn't work at all. Also the problem is that while i can see what the director wanted with his action scenes it's just not working. He wanted the glossy and extreme feel of perhaps a comic or anime, and helps the live-action with generous use of special effects (to say the least). Mostly though it comes off as overblown to the point where it's silly. Not only is it beyond all limits of reality, it's so far beyond them that it loses all relation to reality. And when the characters are able to do anything, how can we really appreciate what's difficult and what's not.What is perhaps most sad about this movie is that it could have been something great. For about half the movie it comes very close to being non-stop action which i assume some people would appreciate. Despite the plastic and fake feel of the sets and action sequences there are also a few action scenes that work surprisingly well. Most of the time though this just isn't working. I said in the beginning that this movie was better than Aeon Flux. I loathed this movie somewhat less because at least here i could understand what the director was trying to do, also at least a few of the action scenes got my pulse beating a little faster, finally the story was a little better explained (although that's not saying much considering the mess that Aeon Flux was). Aeon Flux has only one advantage really, it is without doubt a much better-looking movie.Still the problems overwhelm this movie. I'm seriously bored with vampire super-fighters killing hundreds of faceless soldiers in never-ending battles. Not to mention movies looking like half-finished video-games with about as much coherence in the script-writing. For a while the \"thinking man's action movie\" seemed to be the wave of the future. Right now though we seem to be back at about the same level as \"Commando\" except with more gloss (lip and otherwise). And it's about as exciting. Skip this one.",

            "review_title": "What happened?",
            "content": "I can describe UltraViolet and make it sound like one of the best films of the year. It has ambition with some of its ideas \u0096 it's attempt to re-imagine vampirism in futuristic science fiction terms. It takes place in a setting where style rules the production design, costume design, and cinematography. Bright colors fill the frame, fights focus on the flow of movement instead of practicality, and the very dynamic camera moves with grace through a cityscape whose quasi-real matte-painting appearance makes the film look like an animated comic book (much in the same way as Sin City, only in color.) And watching UltraViolet, I can say most (if not all) the pieces were in place to take the box office and critics by storm. Everything to make this a memorable, unique, and interesting film is on the screen. But when it came to putting all these great pieces together, someone got frustrated and started smashing it with a hammer until everything fit at the expense of leaving no survivors.The audience must then endure the sad experience of watching a great film with great ideas screwed up in the final stages of production.The opening credits features the camera moving in on various comic book covers, then panning up or down to reveal a credit emerge from the text. A neat idea, yes. Very cool. But, unfortunately, that's exactly how all the credits play with no real variation, and so this neat idea becomes as monotonous as watching a pendulum (a well drawn colorful pendulum, but a pendulum none-the-less.) From there Violet gives a lengthy voice over narration - a run down, if you will, of \"a world you might not understand.\" Contrary to her words, we do understand the world, and we also understand that this information could be delivered more interestingly, more colorfully, not to mention more concisely. It's a voice over for the sake of opening the film with a voice over, where after Violet had explained the world, explained the disease, explained her origin, explained her enemies \u0085 I was already lost with boredom.Violet intercepts a weapon the humans intend to use against her kind, and Kurt Wimmer goes through great lengths (gratuitous lengths) of showing the security measures, giving only a suggestive line of dialogue to explain how she still breached. More curiously: immediately after the breach is discovered (after the real courier shows up), suddenly the facility knows the intruder is Violet, furthermore the facility also knows everything about Violet \u0085 and somehow this information did not come up while scanning her every which way imaginable? The first of the overabundance of fight scenes ensues, bringing into play several wicked ideas. In this futuristic world, matter can be compressed to microscopic proportions so guns seem to materialize out of thin air allowing Violet to carry and conceal an entire arsenal. She activates a gravity device that allows her to walk on ceilings, fall up through the roof, and drive a motorcycle along the side of a building in a very stylized effects sequence. Very, very cool stuff.Sadly, this immediate ingenuity to the battles fails to carry over to the later fights except in fleeting moments. The fight atop the needle rooftop showcases a virtuoso use of reflections in the editing room. Later on, a gun battle in the library shreds the books, and remnants of literature rain down as the fight progresses. Swords on fire with limited illumination for the film's climax. Neat ideas, but they missed the mark.As the film progresses, it introduces the absolute weakest part of the film: Six, the little boy whose frozen expression makes you want to strangle him. The plot can't seem to make up its mind as to what it wants to do with Six, so for about an hour it whimsically flip flops back and forth with the indecisiveness of choosing a midnight snack. So naturally the film stumbles, tumbles, and falls flat on its face whenever attempting to go somewhere with the kid.Daxus, the main villain, shows signs of a uniquely twisted, smug, and over-the-top evil mastermind, unfortunately the final cut of UltraViolet has handed Daxus (along with most other characters), virtually nothing to do except chew scenery, show up when the plot needs him, and ask rhetorical questions like, \"Are you mental?\" Supposedly, Daxus is attempting to execute his evil scheme of killing off the vampires once and for all, but he pursues it with the intensity and passion of running up to the store for AAA batteries and gum.Other characters occupy this world \u0096 Violet's former employer whom she's turned on to protect Six, but that conflict exists solely to cram three more unnecessary (not to mention bland) fights into the film. No exploration, no development, it's just thrown away. There's also Garth. The old ally the hero can always turn to for sanctuary. You know, the one responsible for most of the exposition and answers to all the questions? In three sentences I've described all the development that went into Garth.It's mind boggling how UltraViolet could fail so miserably with so many wonderful ideas under its belt (its intriguing premise, graphic-novel-in-motion appearance, cool sci-fi gadgetry to name a few.) If it's true that a movie can be more than the sum of its parts, UltraViolet proves that a movie can also be less than that sum.",

Their production was slightly better than a high school (college?) production, but it managed to keep me enthralled throughout all of his episodes simply b/c the plot was so interesting, and the characters so dynamic.Milla Jojovich? 10/10.Ultraviolet? (sans Milla Jojovich) 2/10.PS: 1) there are some clever scenes so I changed my vote from a 1 to a 2. 2) The movie started again after it ended and went to black... I kept watching simply and only to watch Milla Jojovich. 3) How can V be such a \"monster\" if she is so compassionate for life?? (in its very roots, the movie is self-contradictory). And finally, 4) Aeon Flux was way *worse* than this.-LD______________________________________________my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/",

Some movies can be confusing and yet intricately smart with deeper shades of meanings some examples might be The Usual Suspects, Blade Runner, eXistenZ, or watching the matrix the first time. This movie however lacks the depth to make it of great interest to the general science fiction community.Example of Confusion: The playground scene is a stark visual break from the rest of the film and seems inconceivable that a perfect weapon such as Violet would be on a the playground equipment with six.It is also hard to identify with Six who is played as a very cold individual and defies reason that Violet is so interested in making him his ward.There's is a good deal of eye candy Milla Jovovich is a stunning woman who is wasted in a rather mindless plot. The future world is often portrayed well. The ease of combat for Violet however makes suspense a lacking element.",

I don't pay much attention to the plot, I just look at the screen and in this film I liked what I saw. There is plenty of action, and I mean plenty. I counted at least 3 uses of the one v many scenes made famous in things like Kill Bill, and although it could have done with a bit more gore (for realism, you understand) there's enough to go around. Regarding the CGI, OK it was low for this era, some of the worst I've seen, but a film can only make its budget stretch so far. Besides, you can see the dedication the actors have. I don't think that Kurt Wimmer is a very good director, but you can see Milla Jov. trying her best. What Im trying to say is, this film is for those like me. those who just sit there and watch, not paying any attention to the critic's opinions (Mark Twain: The public is the only critic whose opinion is worth anything at all). Ultraviolet has action and acting, not to mention the Queen of Kick-butt herself, Jovovich. what more could a guy ask for in a film?",

After 15 minutes of watching this, you can tell that the storyline was going to be weak. So, one would hope that the action sequences would save this movie. Did it? NOPE. They looked cool. They looked fresh. But every scene was ruined by quick cuts and hyped up music. WHen things actually slowed down to get a look at the choreography, you were disappointed. Nothing innovative about the fight scenes here. Nothing impressive, in my opinion. If you're going to make a movie like this... spend more time working out the choreography. Make it interesting to watch. Make it memorable. Every obstacle that was thrown at Milla was a joke. She beat every villain without batting an eye. That gets boring after a while. I'm not saying I want to see her character get hurt. It would be nice to see a challenge. Anyone that decides to make another action movie using martial arts needs to actually watch some good movies before making one. Case in point, Jackie Chan's Who Am I has to be one of the most horribly scripted pieces of garbage in the history of film. Yet every fight scene in that movie was a joy to watch. In my opinion, it saved the movie! Ultraviolet had a convoluted, futuristic story that could've been saved by the action if any decent choreography was attempted. But that was not the case.",

We are shown Violet's emotions through colour changes instead of through acting or dialogue.The fight scenes are seamless but bland, lacking the artistry of the Matrix or Crouching Tiger, or the innovation of seeing gun kata for the first time in Equilibrium.High-tech is used as a deus ex machina to wow us with CGI or as a plot device in the case of the \"flat space\" (bag of holding) that allows Violet to carry innumerable weapons.This film is so bad it makes Aeon Flux looks good.

I endured it to the end purely because I like to finish something once started, but watching it to the end was quite a waste of time as the ending was highly predictable.This really should have been a half hour mini-drama, not a 90 minute long film. It consists mostly of slow motion sequences, lots of unnecessarily extensive fight and chase scenes and a large amount of the lead character, Violet, walking along corridors. As an example or this, approximately the first ten minutes of the film are dedicated to Violet making it through a series of doors and security checks.There is very very little in terms of story, just lots and lots of action, much of which is in slow motion. It's like the producers said to themselves \"Hey guys, we've got a really terrible movie here in which hardly anything happens and we still need to stretch it over a full 90 minutes, how do we do that?\" \"Oh I know, let just put in loads of slow-motion scenes, that way we can make the movie longer without putting anything else in it!\"The amazing thing is: the only reason I watched this film in the first place was because I saw it on a list of \"the best 20 sci-fi movies of 2000-2009\".

            "content": "The problem with \"Ultraviolet\" is that the concept is all wrong. Video games are fun when you are playing them, because you don't know whether you are going to get to the next level or die and get stuck on the first one. But the video game as a movie is boring, because you already know what is going to happen even before the film begins. But Ultraviolet's problems do not end there. There is very little plot or character development with the result that the entire movie is crowded with action scenes. Well that works fine in a video game context, but that idea is not feasible for a movie. Watching non-stop, predictable action scenes from beginning to end, to a video game soundtrack, is as dull as watching paint dry. Not only that, but the action scenes in Ultraviolet make even less sense than in many James Bond or Arnold Schwartzenegger films. For instance, you see Ultraviolet (Milla Jovovich) enter a room and destroy around 100 bad guys, without even sustaining a single wound. At least in Commando, Arnold Schwartzenegger got a few bruises in his battle with the Colombian criminal network; and at least James Bond got tortured in Casino Royale -- how cool is that? Perhaps next time Milla Jovovich should give Arnold and Daniel Craig some pointers on how to battle the bad guys without getting a scratch. Now that would be an interesting conversation to watch, if it was ever put into a second Ultraviolet movie. But sadly video game movies, like Ultraviolet, are not witty in that way; they are gloomy, predictable, unrealistic and monotonous. This film also stars Cameron Bright as the cute boy \"Six,\" who unfortunately is not given any good lines to make him more likable. Nick Chinlund as the villain Daxus at least provides a few laughs in this film. As for Milla Jovovich, she is undeniably beautiful and has great sex appeal, but unfortunately we see her involved in so many video game scenarios that we quickly forget about all that. Also it was a shame that film director and screenplay writer Kurt Wimmer did not make the most of Ultraviolet's vampire identity. He could have taken a few notes from films like \"Twilight\" and the \"True Blood\" series which became very popular, because they had fascinating (and often sexy) vampires in them. But that angle unfortunately was not explored either. This film was obviously made for video game geeks and in that sense it may have succeeded; but everyone else got left out of the fun.",

It was so incredibly pointless, that I actually fell asleep half way through it. The plot seemed like it had a chance of success at the beginning but soon crumbled and fell like so many before it.Mila Jovovich is supposed to be this indestructible killing machine engineered by scientists as one of a group of elite soldiers (sounds familiar? *cough* Universal Soldier *cough*). A virus which was supposed to make them better soldiers ended up contaminating half the globe and plunging the world into a state of fear and corruption. Since when have we used viruses to improve ourselves and why the hell would we do it if there's even a slight chance of it leaking out? The story gets even duller when six, a human boy whose blood is the key to either killing or curing all the so called \"vampires\", is introduced. Ultraviolet tries to keep six alive to unlock the answer which is apparently in his blood.All I'm saying is that if you're the type of person that really enjoys a good story and interesting events, this is definitely not the movie for you. If you much rather see senseless violence, decent special effects, and one of the hottest celebrities out there, go watch this movie.My rating: 2/10 in General 3/10 for an action movie 2.5/10 for a futuristic thriller",

One doesn't expect much going in to a movie like this -- at best, you're hoping for Resident Evil meets Aeon Flux. But it's no exaggeration to say either of those films are Citizen Kane in comparison to this one.Ultraviolet is a by-the-numbers exercise in techno-scored fight sequences with moments of techno-scored non-fighting in between. It's hard to know where to begin when talking about what's wrong with this movie. The dialogue is stilted and beyond clich\u00e9; the acting is either robotic (Jovovich) or hammy (bad guy Nick Chinlund). Phrases like \"My God! Look!\" and \"Poor bastard,\" are uttered without any irony whatsoever. Only reliable character actor William Fichtner comes off as vaguely human (ironically, since his character isn't).But, granted, you don't expect Shakespeare when you go to see Ultraviolet, so if that were all that were wrong, it could be forgiven. Unfortunately, it's not. The movie looks terrible. Every frame is awash in blurry-looking CG. Every single closeup of Jovovich has a massive digital vaseline smear across it -- in one shot, her nose is so washed away that her nostrils are just black dots on her face. The exterior shots don't even have the pretense of realism. Of course, the movie is supposed to be a kind of comic book (just to hammer that point home, the opening credits are a bunch of \"Ultraviolet\" comic book covers, and the closing credits are in a \"comic book font\"), but rather than an authentic vision, it feels like laziness. Aesthetically, it seems like Ultraviolet is unhappily caught somewhere between live-action and animation, and this uncertainty makes it impossible to even believe in the movie's physical reality, much less anything else.So unoriginal plotting, bad writing, bad acting, bad cinematography. Anything else? How about that NOTHING in the movie makes any sense? At all? Most movies (and especially science-fiction movies) don't hold up logically if you think about them for too long, but Ultraviolet crumbles in the moment you're watching it. Who is Violet addressing in the opening and closing voice-over (\"My name is Violet, and I was born into a world you might not understand...\")? Does the virus make people stronger, or weaker? Are the infected people \"hemophages\" or vampires? Or are those the same? Am I supposed to know the difference? And why vampires? What does that mean? Do they drink blood? How can a virus give you fangs? Why is Milla able to hide out for so long when she's carrying a tracking device? How do you put a child in a briefcase? Can needles really be inserted into the eyeballs of humans without ill effect? Why is everyone in the movie a balletic fighter? What's the significance of Milla's magical blade with the runes and stuff on it? Where'd she get it? Most sci-fi movies might make at least a lame pass at explaining these things, so the viewer can think, \"Oh, that might be dumb, at at least it's a reason.\" Not in Ultraviolet. All kinds of credibility-defying stuff is presented without a shred of context or explanation, and this is just a random sampling off the top of my head.About the only positive thing that can be said about this film is that Milla's hot, and so is her fighting. But the movie's flaws leave you so uninvolved that it's impossible to even care.In the end, Milla should have been Aeon Flux instead of Charlize, and Ultraviolet should not have been made. Flux would have kicked more ass, and we'd have one fewer awful movie.",

But then the critics made a huge massacre, anyway I kept myself wanting to confirm that with my own eyes.The bad thing on this movie is the poor production and the limited budget in a plot so fulfilled by technologic and futuristic things. Kurt Wimmer is a good director, but he's not Bryan Singer to make miracles and an-X-Men-thing with just US$40 mil in his pocket. There are very good positive points: a) the idea is very interesting, we all have to agree with that; b) despite the fact that I don't like Milla Jovovich that much, she is perfect for the modern action movies because she has the body and limited facial expressions for that; c) there are a few and very good visual moments in the movie, and I hope you agree with that too even if sometimes it looks a lot plastic; d) the fighting scenes, wow... there are some very great scenes, and Kurt Wimmer created an amazing fighting technique and the choreography is superb, and I hope you pay(ed) a very good attention for it.But the negative points make this movie an example of mess: a) everything is very fast since the beginning and you can't go with it. When Milla opens the movie saying that \"she was born in a world that we might not understand\", boy... take that seriously, I'm meaning that; b) the 'deja vu' thing is always there: Kill Bill, Aeon Flux, Underworld, Matrix, Blade Runner, etc... but in a very dysfunctional way. Looks like Kurt was putting things on the plot as the way he was probably remembering and not something like Tarantino did with Kill Bill by not only remembering but revisiting an all atmosphere in a specific kind of action genre; c) expecting another visual revolution in movies, they just made something very strange and there are times that you don't know if they are trying to make a comic book \"direction-ed' thing (like Sin City) or it's just a very bad visual effect made by a trainee and his home computer. Sometimes the visual effects are great, but most of the times it's a mess and it doesn't fit on the screen, giving me headaches for so much color and plastic computer graphics; d) a lot of things just happens without explanations, like the changeg of color in her hair and clothes... what's that? Something about her humor? Her power? For me, there are simple things in movies that just have to be clear for the audience understand so we don't lose the focus on story by thinking about it all the time, this color thing is something that is not effective during entire movie and you will just understand all that thing after watching the bonus material.The bonus material is interesting because it explains and makes you understand all of what Kurt Wimmer had in mind, which I have to say one more time, is brilliant, but what he had in mind and the final results doesn't fit together.",

Also, there is a peculiar method of direction which stinks of 'art for arts sake', like a fresh media student. For example, at one point the camera zooms into violet's ear and emerges from a gun barrel. Laughable.The plot and acting are no better.On the plus side I did like the *ideas* of nano tech, dimensional portals and anti gravity, even if the implementation was poor. Also Violet looks quite nice in her skimpy costumes.Overall this film is a real pity, because they must have spent a lot on the effects.

She captures a 'weapon' that turns out to be a child who she then steals to protect for a undisclosed reason. But it turns out that he isn't a weapon against hemophages but a weapon against humans so the dictator of this totalitarian state can keep control of the\u0085 something. I'm not really sure. The story resembles a disconnected mumbled rant by some bin-looting loon. To say it's unrealistic would be monolithic understatement. Its about not-vampires-honest or 'people with an infection' who apparently aren't humans anymore but a whole new race despite that fact its called an INFECTION. Oh and they're terrorists. Whoops I mean 'freedom fighters'. However the main issue I have with the plot isn't the stupidity of it, but the moral ambiguity. We're supposed to support Violet, she doesn't want to kill the humans, bless 'er. Though she does. Lots. And the 'freedom fighters' are good right? Because they're fighting a corrupted, politico-religious, dictatorial system, right? I dunno! The film hints at this with hospitals and research labs as semi religious centres and the dictator called 'Deacon', but doesn't ever take the time to explain it. The whole film seems to be a sequel without the aid of a first film for the exposition. With the hemophages walking around at the beginning with red identifying armbands, I suppose its some kind of metaphor for the persecution of the Jews. Or possibly AIDS, since it is an infection. But then again people with AIDS aren't considered a different race. So yeah, I am guessing it all about the racism thing. But then at the end of the film they find a cure! If they wanted a cure what was the point of fighting for their freedom in the first place? See? It's a moral mess. There isn't enough room here to explain the labyrinthine plot. A NEVER WILL BE. Something else to take issue with in on the con's list is a personal bugbear of mine, The style. How a director managed to get style over content with the mammoth plot line is actually impressive. The film looks like the director found all the light and colour they sucked out of 'Sin City' and said 'Hey, I know what I can use this for'. Then he turned the contrast right up to 11, poured on an unhealthy dose of lens glare and presumably went to polish the walls some more. The look of the scenes are so multicoloured shiny surfaces, polished steel and glass that it began to hurt my eyes, until eventually it just hurt my brain. It's all way too much. That's a rather good phrase actually, it applies to most of the film. Apart from the acting of course, When it comes to that there just wasn't enough. Each scene flies past without as much as a by your leave, so that any actual acting left is simply parroting the lines and legging it off to shoot someone in the face. The shining light of the whole experience is William Fichtner. Look him up, he's been in a lot, but there just isn't enough screen time for him to stretch. Other than what little of him we see the acting is universally bad.However, none of these things ruin 'Ultraviolet' per se. There's nothing wrong with hyper unrealistic style. The acting is certainly less smug than 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'. And I can deal with a plot too big for the film, look how awesome 'Lord of the Rings' is. None of these problems kill the film. What does brutally and bloodily murder it is the old 'It-could-have-been-good' flaw. OK it was never going to be 'Citizen Kane' but 'Ultraviolet' was filmed, edited and polished and sent of to the studios by the director for reviewing. Then some money-crazed producer got his hands on it and performed a smash-and-grab with some editing equipment. They cut it down from 120 to 88 minutes. Deciding it was too emotional they got rid of most of the 'down' scenes leaving minimal plot exposition. It could have fixed so much. Still, we'll never know.",

This day and age there is no excuse for something so appalling. 'It had a low budget' No excuse, they had awful 3D artists, and should of scrapped them. For anyone who has the privilege of not seeing it, the quality was basically a gradient background or pattern with an overlay of some real action, there was no depth of the city, the Big tower about 15 minutes in, just had a chrome texture applied, and the whole thing visually was (excuse my French) crap. It wouldn\u2019t mind if it was the odd action scene, but Every single shot has this horrible cgi and green screening, the whole movie looks like it was done in some kid's garage.Acting, Heavy use of French accents to hide the non existent character development or portrayal, basically French = evil, and that\u2019s it, its something from a 80's sketch show would do.The action scene with the vampires was just laughable, to start of, I counted 3 minutes, of zooming in to each characters bland expressions. Then every bad guy shot each other somehow missing violet in the middle of it all. I gave up after this scene.Shocking use of holograms to build fake emotion and suspense, cheating the audience of any real build up.A cartoon style zoom in of the workings of the gravity device is shown every single time it is activated, this greatly annoyed me as it lasts about 30 secs, and you just want to see action, not a mini black hole form.I think about 25% of the movie is wasted doing close ups and pans of characters poeses before they fight, somehow ignorantly believing the audience wants and enjoys this and is helping us get pump'ed for the action. And Its sadder the action is about 1/2 as long as the 'build up' phase.If anything they should of cut these scenes, and restore some coherency.The dialogue is beyond corny, its horribly wooden, fixed and forced. and only pars the terrible visuals.If your gullible to try and sit though it after the motorbike scene give up, its not worth watching all the way though, you will be left confused annoyed and 88 minutes of your life shorter.",

            "content": "If there's a 'should've been better' box in the movie archives, Ultraviolet is in it. In theory, all Kurt Wimmer had to do with this movie was make Equilibrium with Milla Jovovich in it instead of Christian Bale, as in effect the two movies are pretty similar. However, while Equilibrium was an unexpected joy, at least a 7 or an 8, Ultraviolet takes all the 'cool' visual elements of Wimmer's previous movie and jettisons the little subtleties and nuances in favour of a flavour-of-the-week Matrix CG 'my effect is bigger than yours' showcase.If there was one thing that made Matrix lose points with me, it was that the characters, once self-aware, could do what they wanted when inside the Matrix itself. In the Matrix, that's a plot element and although I didn't like the fact that the characters were more or less invincible I could accept it as part of the storyline. Well, Milla Jovovich's Violet seems to be invincible for no reason ever explained. The only time she gets hurt is a couple of little scratches during a sword-fight. It's the same rock that the Resident Evil movies get scuttled on (and with the same actress!), you need to feel that the main character is vulnerable in some sense in order to root for them, you need a feeling that they're in danger, otherwise any action sequence is downgraded into a nice little dance/pyrotechnics display. Hell, they shoot her point blank in the back of the head in this and she even survives that without a scratch.So, on an action level, this is nothing more than eye-candy. Same with Equilibrium so far, I mean, Bale was physically unstoppable, but struggling against the powers that be in an epic fashion plot-wise. Violet, well, the only thing she's struggling with is a sudden pang of maternal instinct, and she doesn't let that get in the way of all the punching and sword-swinging. Frankly, this movie is pretty much exactly the same story as the B-Movie Chameleon, but other than a lack of visual artillery, that out-guns Ultraviolet all over the shop. It even has a better-looking star.Basically, visually this movie is fairly sumptuous, but at the expense of any real substance. If you like things that explode prettily and dystopian future settings, stick with the Matrix series. If you tune in expecting an entertaining Kung-Fu sci-fi B feature, you'd be much better off with the aforementioned Equilibrium or one of the Chameleon series. I never thought there'd come the day where something made Chameleon look like an under-rated classic, but the storyline is the same, and it does it much better with far more realistic (and violent) fight sequences. And, if you're watching for ze ladiez, Bobby Philips is way hotter than Milla Jovovich any day of the week.",

            "content": "Let me be perfectly clear: Milla Jovovich is hot. Super hot, with the \"it\" factor of classic movie stars, but her career careens between obscure small films and big-budget, SFX-laden action spectaculars. Her over-the-top performance in The Messenger was my favorite until I saw the very strange horror/SF/Chinese action hybrid Ultraviolet.How do I compare thee to a summer's day, sweet vampire Violet? I am going out on a limb here to say that our future, filled with disease and terrorism, will not be unlike this movie. In more ways than one, of course. While there may not be any blood-sucking mutants with 12-year life spans on the horizon, we have a rocky road to endure.I like the lead character's incredible cynicism. She may be empathetic (with her relationship to the boy clone \"Six\") but she cannot love. Milla turns one of the most unoriginal and clich\u00e9d female characters into a triumph of future noir pessimism. She is an unstoppable killing machine, of course, this being a necessity of SF-hybrids since the advent of The Matrix (which was a myopic stew of much better genre movie clips). Yet Milla has that amazing something despite having to speak such horrendous, trite dialogue. I would love to write her a movie where the darkness that seems to seep from her very being in almost every role can be completely fulfilled. Perhaps a science fictional Lady Macbeth -? Most of all, Ultraviolet is a vapid detonation of atomic digitalia. More pixels per square centimeter than any other \"film\" in history. In fact, the movie was shot with digital equipment. I could tell this in the poor resolution, the washed-out images, the incredibly fake effects. True, much of the cityscapes and action set pieces were designed to look like video games (since VG fan boys are the target audience for every Milla Jovovich SF project) but when is faux too faux? How long do we have to put up with film school rejects uploading homemade animations to YouTube becoming Hollywood directors-o-the-moment? Wasn't the Michael Bay era enough of a Dark Age for cinema? Oh wait, it's not over \u0085.George Lucas is to blame. He convinced Brian Singer to use a digital camera for Superman Returns, which lost the VFX Oscar in 2007. He has given tens of millions to USC to raise the next generation of \"bedhead\" auteurs. Great filmmaking is about vision, about storytelling and wonderful characters, not acres of rendering computers. You can put actors in front of green screens for months and end up with an embarrassing, twitching, limbless Darth Vader lost in digital lava. We do not care about such caricatures. Give me Gone With the Wind or Seven Samurai any day. Remember when directors used real extras and not pixel people in service to epic drama? Ultraviolet ricochets crazily off the walls of the vampire myth and the SF-future depicted in eye candy operas like The Matrix. No amount of CGI done cheaply in Hong Kong can save it from a Hammer Horror fate: cinematic obscurity. Milla's bare midriff and slim but sexy haunches aside, there is nothing to recommend this movie except perhaps the rare moment or two where the character is actually resigned to be human, tears and all. We expect this from our tragedies, our comedies, our histories.In the end, the George Lucas attack- of-the-clone-directors will fade into oblivion and we will still want to watch My Darling Clementine just for the shot of Henry Fonda as Wyatt Earp kicking back on the front porch and squinting into the dusty western street. For film is about such wonderful cinematic moments, not what sounds good projected on someone's widescreen TV.Milla, can you save us -?",

It certainly is stylish and weird, but the filmmaking is so bad at some parts that it hinders the overall experience so much.The comic-book-style opening credits made me hopeful for the movie, but the CG is too poor at points, even if I was prepared for unrealistic, outdated CG before going in. It felt cheap. Also the color grading was too bright and made me kinda eyesore. The action scenes are weirdly bloodless and I hated when they decided to cut away from the action scenes for some reason.But the mother-son relationship was what (sort of) saved the movie in the second act (even though it was half-baked) and there are genuinely creative and cool concepts and ideas here. (Burning Sword, disposable phone etc). It is execution that really could and should have been better.It is frankly poorly made and I totally see why people hated this, but at least it is an 'interesting' movie for sure. I sort of wish for a remake or reboot for this where they keep the aesthetic and ideas but hand it over to an actually competent filmmaker.Also I didn't know this was directed by the guy who made Equilibrium, but Ultraviolet is a way worse version of that. This is basically the same type of movie as \u00c6on Flux.

This next one was made in Hong Kong with some different companies, and the result is a staggering failure.First off, the casting. Milla Jovivich, playing Alice, er, Violet, is flat and emotionless. Nick Chunland is laughable as the villain. Bill Fitchner plays essentially the same character he did in Equilibrium, but with fake werewolf teeth. The dialog is beyond hamfisted. It seems Kurt felt like the only way to make Violet interesting is for her to spew lines like \"I'm going to chop your arms off\" or \"I'm a titan, a monolith\". The plot is also very confusing.Another thing about this movie is the pure derivativeness of it. The action, story and design is exactly the bloody same as Equilibirum. She uses the same mini-uzis that Christian Bale had, and they even have the same muzzle flash. But while that movie had energy, the action here is totally listless. When a swordfight can put you to sleep, we have a problem. The climax of the movie takes place in the pitch black, with flaming swords. I kid you not. This is the kind of thing 12-year olds find cool.As for the visual design of the movie, well, everything is overly bright, garish shades of red, white, and silver, enough to give anyone a splitting headache. The cinematography is kind of wrong for this movie, and its like watching through plexiglass. The set designs look like something out of a music video. Peoples clothes inexplicably change color. And I haven't even mentioned the CGI effects. Dear Jesus the computer effects actually HURT to look at. I thought I was watching a cartoon at certain points.

What a ride! *** SPOILERS COMING ***I still haven't read anyone else's review. And I'm giving it 3 stars to preserve the \"classic\" 3-4 average score.

I liked everything - the \"cheesy\" video game feel to the CG, the non-vampire vampire plot, the villains, the fight scenes, the sets, the music (even though I prefer it a bit _harder_). To me, Ultraviolet makes Aeon Flux look a bit lame. You can tell by the 5.5 average for AF - that's worse than 3.7. Really. And Charlize is also super hot. But Milla with guns and a sword, and a super hot outfit, well, . . . . . need I say more?

Actually, it's all about Milla! She just rocks! But when it comes to somewhat subversive mainstream movies, the best ones, in this reviewers opinion, garner a 3-4 average on IMDb and deserve your attention!

But, yesterday night, my internet connection was so bad this was the only movie that loaded.Well, I thought about being sarcastic here, or a bit offensive as some people were. But no, there's no need for that. This is certainly one of the \"top 5 worst\" films I've ever watched. Seriously, it's that bad. Actually, it's much worse than \"that bad\". What attracted me? Well, Milla is very good looking, her body is very sexy and she seems to love doing action movies. And the whole future + mystic thing sounded like a good idea.The opening imitates the Marvel movies, with Comic Books and all. I thought that Ultraviolet was indeed a comic book, but it isn't. So, as I see it, the opening is a lie. They didn't need to do that. In fact, nothing at all (about the movie) resembles a comic book. Then, Milla speaks the first lines, telling the story of this version of the future: the US military altered a virus that changed humans into something else, the whole world changed and a tyrant rules everything. It's like Resident Evil's poor cousin, but with the same actress.OK, so, the story is stupid. And it goes like this: US military finds a virus, change the virus, lose control of the virus; virus changes people into vampires that walk on daylight and don't drink blood (ever!); a clich\u00e9 and totally predictable tyrant rules the world (or the US, they never said so) and uses soldiers to hunt down the vampires. They don't say why they hunt the vampires, but they do. No normal human during the movie expressed any hatred towards vampires, fear of the virus, angered towards the tyrant. In fact, only the vampires and military do anything at all; the normal humans just walk around. And Milla, of course, is a vampire that \"fights back\". And we're supposed to cheer for her. Just because. No other reason given.Oh, and there's also the clich\u00e9 of \"the last hope\", that is a child/clone who carries a virus, that either kills all vampires or all humans. They ping-ponged between those possibilities. Milla first tries to protect the kid, then doesn't care if he dies, protects him again but he dies, she cries and he's no dead. But she is dying. She tells the kid that mid movie. She doesn't say why she's dying. Then she does die. Then a vampire that loves her brings her back to life and she hates him for that.Then, in the end, I'm not quite sure what happens, but both her and the kid were about to die (again), but don't. Or they did and I just didn't get it, my brain was trying hard to block anything that came from that movie.The special effects are horrible! Considering the movie was released in 2006, it's all horrible. If it was released in, say, 1995 or so, they I'd say \"ok, they did their best\". But that just looked like a very poor game for PlayStation2. That's for the action sequences. The entire city is CGI of terrible quality, that resemble PlayStation1! Yes, seriously!Her acting is the worse I've seen of her. As the story makes no sense, the dialogues can't be saved. Weird ultra-clich\u00e9 lines, everything is predictable and I'm pretty sure Milla's character is retarded. Her hair and clothes change color all the time. It was supposed to be cool, but it's just weird and stupid. She always wears the same thing, showing her midriff. OK, she does have a sexy flat tummy that I love, but everything about her is completely different from everyone else. For someone doing a covert operation, she seems to be holding a banner saying \"I'm here, look at my belly button!\". (which I did!)The technology is absurd! A motorcycle that runs on building's wall (up and sideways), jumps, flies and does other stuff. Guns that appear from her hands, with infinity ammo, swords with blades covered in runes and fire...it's all too much, all too absurd!And she is unstoppable. She outsmarts computers that scan blood and bone, then walks naked through a big scanner (I don't know what they were scanning now if they scanned her earlier...maybe they just wanted to see her butt). When she's gonna be mean and go \"full crazy fighting mode\", she put of her sunglasses (that she wears under the motorcycle helmet) and says \"Watch me.\". She fights one, ten, dozens...and then hundreds of soldiers. Never gets hit once! Never bleeds! Never runs out of breath. She's never afraid. She's always sure of what she is doing, and who gets in her way dies.I think she killed some 2000 enemies (soldiers and her fellow vampires). All soldiers wear the same uniform and have the same weapons: assault rifles and long blades. By the end of the movie, some elite soldiers wear all white. So, I'm thinking they had like 10 or 12 extras to use as soldiers and everything had to be repeated. The low F.X. points to low budget, so I think that was it. She only bleeds at the end of the movie. But she wins. She kills everyone. Because she wants to. It's never really clear who is the bad guy or the good guy. But she is Milla, she is hot and she fights back. So they want us to cheer for her. But we can't! There's no reason for it. At all. We don't care about any character in this movie, or what happens next.So, lame story, no plot, no character's depth, horrible F.X., impossible technology, exaggerated fights and an avalanche of clich\u00e9s.If you're 10 years old, you're gonna love this!",

I found the plot of the movie to be ridiculous I know if i had a ten year old brother he would have loved the movie just because of the graphics and also because of the unrealistic story line the movie was very predictable to me as a 25 year old woman my boyfriend decided to buy it i don't know what he rated it but I am sure it didn't get high marks do yourself a favor and rent it first save your bucks for a better movie.",

Others of her kind are on the verge of extinction.

Armed with inter-dimensional weapons and an anti-gravity device, Jovovich becomes a vampire super-soldier. This is loaded with action and a lot of good CGI effects. In my opinion, too many effects, some of which make the movie look a little fake. They certainly sacrifice plot for style. It was hard to follow.

It is one of those movies that you must give second thought. When the movie Bladerunner was first out, way back in 1982, it received no interest in this movie at all. The critics were aghast. But now today bladerunner is in the top 200 IMDb list. I was an early fan of Bladerunner. Ultraviolet is likely to get its ranking up and 3.8 is way too low and will likely get much higher ranking now. There is a reason why.Initially a lot of viewers were turned off by the complicated story line of fighting for something that there is no benefit for her own kind - the Hemophage. But here is the magic, we do things positively for human kind or doing the right thing can and often in our own life results in unintended benefit or advantage.Doing something right does not necessarily mean only you will benefit, or for that matter people of your own kind will see any benefit. There is a much more broader human kind than just you or your own kind.In the event of Ultraviolet, a certain death of her and her kind demands that she and only she do something extraordinarily altruistic in face of all opposition. And in that case, it really really paid back in dividends. It is one of those movie that if you look deeper in yourself and the philosophy of things there is really more to doing good than doing what is needed to be done. It is not just about following orders, it is not about doing something that benefit you or your own kind, it is about something much more. It is about doing the things we really feel it is the right thing. It is about giving. Watch this movie from this philosophy and try to sense the depth of this and you will find it is really a good movie.",

Also the film speaks to a more realistic set of fears and possible solutions insofar as it refers to a disease that may spread to the whole human race.

Who was Garth and what was his story? Even the action scenes were flat I think because there was no substance to the story, the voice over commentary was limp and didn't tell you enough to actually care about what was happening. And was there a point to Violets changing of the colour of her hair and outfits? The only reason to actually go and see this film is if you are a massive fan of Milla and want to see her in an array of skimpy leather outfits.

Of course it has special effects, but those come fitted as standard these days so are really not the selling point they would have been say ten years ago. The use to which the special effects are put to at times seem rather silly, I can think of a couple of occasions where I was being shown something that I just could not accept as reasonable even in a \"fantasy\" setting. There is a point beyond which it is not possible to suspend belief, and this film went well beyond that point a few times.

            "content": "... that dishonour firmly stains 'Aeon Flux.' That said, 'Ultraviolet' is bad, bad, bad. The foundation seems promising: a high tech and conceptually cool Kurt Wimmer project with Milla Jovovich starring (she's very arguably the biggest female action star around right now). Where does it all go so terribly and horribly wrong? I shudder at unraveling barely repressed memories, but the healing must begin somehow.Milla Jovovich doesn't have the acting chops of Meryl Streep, but then again she's never pretended to either. Her main difficulty here is that what little dialogue she is given hangs her out to dry. Her delivery of terrible dialogue has predictable results on screen. Could a Kate Beckinsale, Natalie Portman or Charlize Theron have done any better? In a way they did by not appearing in the first place. Jovovich is hilarious every time she opens her mouth. This isn't very often because generally she's involved in high octane special effect sequences that 'jump the shark' each time in rapid succession. It is all very cool and she is a stunning beauty who has never looked better. The problem is that we as an audience are trapped in what feels like a ninety-four minute long KMFDM video.If the soundtrack blares along for too long and the infrequent dialogue weakens the performance of a desperately exposed lead actress, maybe we should cover it up by cgi everything, right? Wrong. There is so much work done here on the green screen that it actually works to great ironic effect. When so much of the movie is fake and unreal, I find myself wondering what else is fake and unreal. It turns out to be the characters and their believability. The computer work isn't bad but manages to be so blatant at the same time that I've sprained my eyes from rolling them so much. That makes typing this quite painful, by the way. All of the character relationships seemed really forced. I would say that the one exception is the William Fichtner and Milla Jovovich interplay. Fichtner and Jovovich are really quite good together and Fichtner shows great tenderness and hurt. He is deeply affected and affectionate of the Jovovich character. I really admired his work here and it gave me the strength to continue watching. Actually ... maybe now that I think about it I should resent his strong work. It kept me watching to the end. Nick Chinlund plays the main bad guy and gleefully chews up every line and scene that he can. It's worth taking the volume off 'mute' to listen to him before putting it back on.'Ultraviolet' has a lot of cool if unexplained ideas and some great (though obvious and heavy-handed) technical work. The gun-kata system that Wimmer has devised is cool to watch. The problem is that the film lacks any heart or reason to care about any of the characters. I didn't find anyone but Fichtner's character even remotely interesting. Why would I care about any of them? There really was a lot of potential here and there is a lot of potential for future Kurt Wimmer films. Maybe the next film will have some character to it because even in action film extravaganzas, you will ultimately be hooked by caring about what the characters do or don't do. we never really have that reason to care in 'Ultraviolet.' Better luck next time I hope. The value and attraction of this film will likely rest in the hands of hardcore Milla Jovovich fans and Kurt Wimmer gun-kata enthusiasts. If that's all you're looking for than you've hit the jackpot.",

I prefer a badly done effect done on the cheap with arresting visual ideas than soulless, seamless ILM images costing more than the national education budget of the Philippines. So the story is ripped off from Java bitch's ex-hubby Besson's The Professional or further back to Cassavetes's Gloria, and the bike chase on the building sides is ripped off from Tetsuo and the flaming sword fight is ripped off from Samurai X. Wimmer has been reading Asian, ripping them off is cool, he's in gestation. His next film he'll make a coda of all these themes. If there is a next one. The reviews have been savage and the box office looks discouraging, but as long as his films are low-budget enough, they'll let him continue. Don't be discouraged by the naysayers, Herr Wimmer!

It was the quality of CG and editing as well as completely everything else (except, again, beautiful Mila) that made this move total sh**. \"I was born into the world you might not understand\".

Eventually the boy, and Violet die. But she lives, and the boy lives as well... American Pie has THE DEEPEST AND THE SMARTEST story line compared to that... Action parts are OK, only they are too short. The Matrix rip-off scene with dogging bullets Violet looks quite amusing and cool, some of the other scenes as well.

What drew me to Equilibrium and to this film, was the absolutely unapologetic fast pace and use of action. Other users have commented that many of the fight scenes were overly CGd, and if this movie had CG content, which it did quite a bit, none of it is used to substitute for humans in action. The CG is mostly for things like cityscapes, much of the technology used in the film, and little extra zingers and such. There is even a wide shot at one point after a battle where dead bodies are still seen several minutes after the fight, which is a nice detail that most filmmakers ignore. Let me say that I love action and I love action films and there were points when I was nearly in tears at the beautifully choreographed Gun Kata sequences, a holdover from Equilibrium, now far more balletic and in your face, with the many blessings of higher budget. Unlike some megablockbusters, every penny of the budget is seen on the screen, and if reviewers pan it for being unrealistic, the comic book montage that opens the movie says it all. This movie is designed to be entertaining, escapist, action, and it succeeds on every single level. If you are a fan of action that does not insult your intelligence by pretending to be intelligent, you will absolutely love this film.

            "content": "This was a wonderful idea (not terribly original) that somehow got translated into one of the worst movies I have seen. The basic premise is that a virus is found/created which was intended to make better soldiers but the virus gets out of control. Okay. The virus apparently (I say apparently for reasons below) makes people faster, stronger, more agile, etc. Regular non-infected humans fear and hate those infected so want to get rid of them and fear catching the virus. Interesting enough and although the \"out of control virus\" idea has been done before, I have not seen much where the virus has beneficial side effects like making people faster and stronger. The writers then added scatterings of new technology like dimension compression to put more space into an object or allow weapons to be stored in a glove for example. Okay, I like that. So far so good. The villain(?) has motivation against our heroine. The heroine is awfully hot. All good.That is where it goes bad. I love sci-fi (movies or books) and have read or seen a lot of it. I can pick up on the story line pretty quick. However, this one, after starting the premise, just stopped trying to make it clear. No explanation of what the \"virus\" really does to people. No explanation of exactly what is enhanced. No explanation of why the \"virus\" is bad. A vague reference to why victims of the virus are referred to as hemophage or vampires but only a passing reference and no real explanation of why they would be interested in blood.The movie could have used a 3-5 minute montage at the beginning really setting up the premise better and explaining a few things. Such as why, in the course of perhaps 20 years (based on something that would spoil some of the movie so I cannot really explain except to say that the time from the start of the virus to the time of the movie is apparently a little more than 20 years - for full explanation, see spoiler portion at far bottom) things changed so dramatically. As stated in the first few minutes (so not a spoiler), the medical establishments rise to power as quasi-governments trying to stop the virus. The shapes of the buildings, color schemes, etc. all had good concepts and would have fit but it would have been way more believable if it all happened over a longer period of time. I was reminded of some of the 80's apocalypse movies where X happens and then in 6 months, everyone is living in tin shacks, driving Mad Max cars, filthy dirty and civilization is unrecognizable. C'mon, things might go to pot quickly but not that quickly! This movie had so much going for it and so many ways to be really good and I hate that i did not get to like it. The opening credits show a comic book and I wish this had been a comic book. Then I would have had thought bubbles or explanatory panels and things would have been a lot clearer. This movie was like reading a good comic book but never having those thought bubbles or explanatory panels. The people wore mostly currently clothing styles but the weapons, scanners, \"extra-dimensional\" pockets, \"gravity inverters\", etc. were all way from the future. Did they never change clothing styles? Did no one improve on the idea of an 18 wheeler, helicopter or a motorcycle? Gee whiz.With about 10-15 minutes of extra footage, this could be a great movie but as it stands, it is a complete waste of your time. Spoiler lines start * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Last chance to avoid a spoilerThe main villain is the person who first loosed the virus. Based on his expected age at the time of the flashback (remember, he is a scientist so at least well beyond college age), and his age in the \"current\" time, he could not have aged more than about 20 years at the most I would guess. He does not appear to have aged even that much. Maybe there is some \"age-retardent\" factor that was never mentioned but if it was more than 20 years, I would be really skeptical.",

Stunning, lyrical action scenes. A fight in the dark with flaming swords...A perfectly-cast action goddess swirling her lithe body through the air and delivering artful deaths to the deserving. The clashing innocence of a child she oddly wants to protect. In terms of story and character, the inside word is that the studio messed up the final product (this is commonly the case; the director does not have final cut on a film unless it's Spielberg).",

Let me simplify this like so: Equilibrium gets a 9.5 for plot, 9.5 for acting, and 10 for action/cinematography. Ultraviolet I have to give a 3.5 for plot, 1.0 for acting, and 9.5 for action/cinematography.Milla Jovovich is an awful actress who apparently gets acting jobs based on her affinity for removing her clothing. The plot was tired, old, and lame. The action was pretty good, save some really bad CGI at the beginning. I really love Wimmer's style and eye, but his writing on this one was utterly terrible, as was his choice for a lead. Skip it and go buy Equilibrium on DVD.likemindead",

All I knew was, it quickly grabbed my attention, even though I have little interest in comic book violence or martial arts movies. I do love good sci-fi and have some tolerance for futuristic movies, which are often cold and gray by their very nature.This one was not and so I immediately fell in love with its wonderful art direction.I was also not really a fan of Milla Jovovich, finding what I have seen of the Resident Evil films nothing but mindless violence. This movie changed all that for me.I think she delivers a terrific performance as Ultraviolet. While most women seem to me to have to force out the qualities needed to play these kick butt girls, Jovovich struggles to contain what seems like a volcano of anger within her. In one scene toward the end, when confronted by two opponents who warn her they are as strong and as fast as she is, her response is to ask \"Are you one tenth as ****** off as I am?\" That's the key to her character and she maintains it throughout the film. She is a seething cauldron of righteous indignation. And it seems to me that almost every look, every facial expression and every step she takes reflects this inner anger.While some of the CGI effects may be substandard for the genre, this is a much under appreciated film. I recommend it highly.",

I saw him in Birth with Kidman and he is emotionless. He really is bad here as well. I suppose here he didn't need to express or say much but he could have done better, in Birth he just said his lines without feeling. As long as he stays with movies like this a better child actor wouldn't have changed anything, but in Birth a big change would have been made.A lot of action, not much else.",

I've read through as many comments as I can take and it makes me weep for the future of movies. I've read that people are upset with this movie because they went to the theater expecting not to have to think and then they get upset because there was a plot point they didn't understand. Boo hoo, what are you 6? It used to be that movies actually made people think. That was before Hollywood discovered they could make far more money appealing to the lowest common denominator, ie. idiots. I'd like to go more into idiotic comments others have made, but I don't want to give spoilers and it would be purely for my own benefit anyway.Now, I saw the theatrical version a while back and I just watched the directors cut, and the biggest difference that I saw was that they made the effort in the DC to give more background at the beginning. So if your mind hurt cause you couldn't connect the dots yourself, try that one. If you want to see a really cool movie, that is far more unique than anything I've seen since the Matrix, and you don't mind using a little brain power, I recommend the theatrical version, cause thats what I'm gonna go out and buy.I'm not particularly fond of Kurt Wimmer. I don't know if I like his writing because most of what I've seen of his is an adaptation of some kind. Ultraviolet and Equilibrium are about it, and I don't think that the writing is the strong point in either movie. What I do know is that I don't think much of him as an editor. I didn't like Equilibrium at all, for reasons I won't go into here as its not the Equilibrium page. However, what I can tell is that I sure am glad that Ultraviolet was taken out of his hands because judging by what he did with his directors cut, it might be his influence in the editing room that made me dislike Equilibrium as fervently as I do.Finally, I said earlier that I thought this movie was unique. The plot line wasn't unique, the characters weren't unique, and the fighting certainly wasn't unique, so I can't possibly know what I'm talking about, can I? Find me a movie with a truly unique plot, how about one with unique characters. Unique fights? Not really. All art draws from other what came before. As Oscar Wilde would have told us, it's not always what you say, but how you say it that makes it art. If you're looking for a Die Hard or a Kill Bill or a Matrix, which entertains whether you think about it or not, this is not your movie (and its obvious a lot of people on IMDb don't want to do a lot of thinking). But if your looking for something that is both modern science fiction and yet closer to the golden age of movie making. You just might enjoy this one. It might not be a 10, it might not be a great movie, but remember, Casablanca isn't as good a movie as the Maltese Falcon but it is still regarded as a classic today, and guess what, they didn't hand you the background on a silver platter in that movie either.",

Both movies begin with the respective heroines offering solemn narratives but the Ultraviolet opening credits were a blast with comic book cover parodies.It set the tone for an over-the-top action movie with bits of breezy humor. Unfortunately, there weren't enough of those bits. When UV played it tongue-in-cheek the action flowed and the movie was fun. Then, inexplicably, the tone would suddenly become serious.Why?? No one is going to take this movie seriously, particularly after the opening action sequences. No one is going to buy into the storyline any deeper than is necessary to understand why the folks are fighting. So, why the compulsion to suddenly shift gears and try to add depth and characterization when you've provided no basis for either? If they had just stayed with the fun, outrageous attitude it would have been a much more satisfying movie.The good points: During the lighter sequences, the movie was a blast. Milla is limber and acrobatic enough to cut some nice action sequences. She's far superior in this respect to Charlize Theron (in Aeon Flux). And the tech was fun as well, with compacted dimensions holding lots and lots and lots of guns.The script was the main offender here. There were several inconsistencies in the story, and several plot holes that jarred you out of the movie experience. That's always annoying.The CGI sets and buildings were nicely designed but the CGI action was pretty choppy at times. Still, that was acceptable as long as the movie maintained its comic book style.",

            "content": "Ultraviolet was yes not promoted well since it appeared to be a plot less, senseless use of special effects. But in a sense, the trailer was at least honest. Kurt Wimmer had somewhat of an interesting take on a popular sci-fi theme with Equillibrium casting Christian Bale and Taye Diggs in lead roles whom are pretty good actors in their own right, and the action scenes were a little different than what has been seen in the past, but who could have predicted that this filmmaker's career was developing into the ultra-laughable attempt at something that built upon the logic of Equillibrium but completely missing any character development etc, that one would expect from this later work. I am a fan of Milla since she has become the unofficial new fantasy heroine, and I do not think she dismisses the fact she has been typed cast from the outset, which is fine. But, this film was even worse than the sequel to Resident Evil. Wimmer attempted to inject some sincerity into Milla's character but failed miserably. The action sequences which were obviously to be the film's selling point, were ridiculous. There is one fight sequence with a group of what appeared to be Asian gangsters,which was more focused on how many new transitions the editors could come up with rather than follow any action. With that said, the film appeared to be more of a boring video game you watch as your friend plays. Scene after scene, Milla's character is confronted with a small army of soldiers after every new door she enters. Wait, they have samuri swords, next, they have large guns, blah blah blah. I'm going to cut this short since I could go on for the length of an undergrad thesis just on how terrible this film was. So, I think it is evident that Wimmer needs not to waste our time on his next flick if he is even commissioned to.",

If you forget about the story and appreciate the visual and sound experience, it is a fine crafted movie. Of course it is not very original as a whole, since it obviously draws e.g. on The Matrix and Aeon Flux, but the fight scenes of Milla Jovovich in her skin-tight suit are like flawless performed dances in a video clip, soundtrack included, and some sci-fi inventions are original in their genre and well rendered with computer graphics.

This reminds me of the sci-fi I was a little too young to understand in those days, but I feel the same way watching this film. In a spectacle of awe thinking of merely the metaphors in the film. I love what's really being said in the chase scenes, the loneliness of being different, better, unique. The infection concept is what is really going to effect us all.The special effects were mostly nice in this except some scenes coming towards the final confrontation, there were too many repetitious 3d elements. That being said, if it's the comic book story that is sin city fantasy, I enjoyed it because it was fulfilling. More of circumstance that led me to like this piece I guess.I was just wondering tonight in the pouring heavy hitting rain, how electricity and modern devices, even sociological, are supporting our existence like an extra limb or organ that is necessary. This film seems to show that if you look at some of the plot concepts in it, there are some parallels to our need for high technology embedded in us, which is literal in this piece, as you have seen or will see.Looking to the future, I think this film hits on target well, and seeing it from a high drama, titanic level, there's no comparison, but then again mostly everything we see or do today seems to be made up and fancified anyway. Take it or leave it, you have to be a child to enjoy this movie. At least in your heart and mind, as there is even a reference to it in the film, look for the ripped ad of a playground.Cleverly done in my book, this work was made for a purpose, even if just for an exercise.

The motorcycle chase scene is absolutely abysmal and would have to be one of the worst special effects I've ever seen in a motion picture movie.Kurt Wimmer is upset at the final product and I don't blame him, so much so, it affected his directorial reputation, but don't blame Kurt. It's the blame of the executives at Sony sticking too much of their noses into the final product to become what is this debacle.Not the worst movie I have ever seen, but not too far off it either, but don't hold it against the main characters and the poor director.

However, those dissenting and descending below 4 may have been LOOKing, not viewing this movie.First, the storyline was not all bad. I felt the emotion between Violet and 6 was believable. Granted they could have done something with those ridiculous rubber gloves (a spray or liquid dip or something), but if you're looking to rip the movie there are plenty of inconsistencies. However, Milla plays the role well, and although her WIMMER Arts style makes her no Jet Li, I blame missing techno enhancements for not making her look up to the part. She has the body and the style so get with it guys.Additionally, some that I know who went to see the film walked out early in the movie. It was the LOOK of the movie that turned them off. This technology is not there yet. and in a world of HDTV, 160 degree viewing angles and an infinite number of colors on the palate this movie has no excuse for seemingly blurred vision in some of the fast action sequences especially those on the motorcyle. In one scene where Violet is riding up the building with helicopter in pursuit, the breaking glass is front of her and alongside and behind her looks phony not surreal and too close in contrast to the other colors (copter, cycle, building). The look of this scene and the side shots are a dull, blurred look.Still, I liked, Milla and the storyline. In my opinion, SONY needs to go to work on this technology to make it more appealing to the geek squad. I know a few of these guys, and they walked out early. SONY, you need to earn your way back into their minds and hearts before they are willing to give you another shot.And please...no rubber gloves!",

If you appreciate art direction, vibrant colors, exquisite costume design, and breathtaking architecture and scenery, you'll adore every single second. The special effects create a fantasy future dimension, somewhere in between realism and comic book art. Critics of the special effects presumably missed the point -- photorealism wasn't the goal! Even more impressive is the unique blending of vampire lore with science fiction. It's a bold move on the part of the filmmakers, and it seems to have proved controversial with the public. The action sequences are dazzling, especially considering that no two are alike and several feature brand new martial arts styles invented especially for this film. (The behind- the-scenes extras on the DVD explain the inspirations for these new fighting styles.) Many of Violet's moves are \"defensive\" rather than \"offensive,\" which makes the action even more interesting. The story is complex and by no means whatsoever pointless. Perhaps critics of the storyline did not fully understand the plot, and perhaps the blame lies not with them or even with the filmmaker, but rather with the studio (who brutally edited the footage without the director's permission). Even though this isn't the director's cut of the film, it's a visual feast and a dazzling accomplishment. By the way, Milla Jovovich gives a marvelous, heart-felt performance. Interestingly, she says in the making-of footage on the DVD that when she read the script she strongly related to the character of Violet and wanted to help Violet work through her anger. She saw her character as \"real\" personality, channeled that personality, and transformed/evolved it through the course of the film. Her dedication truly shows.",

From the previews it looked corny and way over the top, but when I found out it was directed by Kurt Wimmer (of Equilibrium fame), I figured it might actually be one badass movie.Boy was I wrong. This movie is pure action, but it's littered with terrible cg effects and even worse acting (complete with plenty of awful one-liners). Once again, Milla Jovovich has proved herself to be nothing more than simple eye-candy (she even does her signature lemme-get-naked-for-no-reason move). The story is hard to follow, the character development is bad and you don't feel anything at all for any of the characters. The movie had great potential, but it's just plain bad. If someone had told me this was directed by Ewe Boll I would not have doubted them.Although Ewe Boll's movies are considerably worse, this movie isn't far off from his recipe for action disasters. In fact the only reason I'm not rating this movie lower than a 3 is because of good ol' Ewe's crap. Save your money for something else 'cause Ultraviolet ultrasucks.",

The film does deliver non-stop action from beginning to end, unfortunately the action does nothing more than make the audience yawn and wish the film would continue. Another IMDb member put it well when he said Wimmer doesn't know when to hold back or restrain himself. The fight scenes were often repetitive, one dimensional, and did little to boost our impression or awe of the title character. Another fault with the film was the utter reliance of \"suspension of disbelief\" to an extreme. Yes, Violet says this is a world we will not understand, but to simply leave it at that and do little (practically nothing) to help the audience to understand this strange world is unjustifiably. This film simply had me going \"eh, it wasn't horrible\" instead of the \"HOLY #*#$\" that Equilibrium gave.Wait to rent. See it simply to enjoy the visuals effects (superb), but be warned the plot feels rushed and almost jumbled. Definitely not one of Wimmer's best, see Equilibrium for that.",

And just a few minutes ago I read a comment (the only useful comment, by the way) which said something Like: \"If we were interested in movies only for their story, we wouldn't be interested in movies at all...we would all read books instead.\" And I think that that summarize this movie. If it weren't by its visual appeal, probably the movie wouldn't be nothing. But this is exactly the important of this movie, it's not just visually rich, is way more than that, it's incredible in every possible way, a delight for the human eye. The colors are beautiful, the views simply amazing. It can touches your heart only by seeing a pair of takes. I wanted to comment this because I always thought that a movie could be value about its plot... or directly by its screenplay, but with this I realized that a movie can touch you only by its scenes, even when the dialogs look sometimes empty and the characterizations seem to be not the best of its actors. Whether you believe it or not, the message of this movie is really good. So if you like every kind of movie, I recommend you this. It requires courage to see it, sensibility to be captivate and intelligence to realize what is its mission in life. But if you make it, the result is very satisfying.",

Also, if nothing in this world is indeed real does that mean that there is a switch somewhere that will turn this mess OFF? And, finally, can I be the lucky guy who get's to flip it? I think the only reason this movie exists is to make the \"Matrix trilogy\" seem plausible by comparison. \"Violet\" is a one-woman gang war, transporting a kid through a futuristic conglomeration of gravity-challenged fire-fights and altercations with roly-poly pinball ninjas (in order to kill him or save him I'm still unsure). After slaughtering upwards of 10,000 guards her maternal instinct kicks in and in an act of tragic sacrifice she kills 10,000 more.

But this movie feels from the very beginning more like a computer game or Japanese anime than an actual movie, and while the action scenes are good, when the whole movie is one long scene of Milla Jovovich striding along corridors and standing poised above the circle of dead enemy soldiers surrounding her, it gets old very fast. In spite of all the action it's very slow-paced, there are very few surprises, and no humor at all. Milla Jovovich was fabulous-she's an underused actress-but with a wooden, repetitive plot utterly unenlivened by any costars, she's forced to carry the burden of a bad movie all on her shoulders, and the best actress in the world couldn't have saved it. There are a few good things-the small role they allot to her costar Garth and the music, which was stunning, but basically it's a cold, boring, and disappointing movie.",

            "content": "Four years on, Kurt Wimmer, writer/director of Equilibrium has taken another shot at trying to create a Sci-Fi Epic. Unfortunately, instead of taking a step forward from Equilibrium, he has taken a step back.Ultraviolet is the story of Violet (Milla Jovovich), a woman who only has thirty-six hours to live. Violet lives in a world torn apart by a Civil War between the Humans and the Hemophages. Violet is a Hemophage \u0096 a disease modified human \u0096 and as a result of this disease, she is faster, stronger and her senses are more acute. Humans fear the Hemophages, as despite their abilities, they have a short life span. In Violet's world, the Humans control and regulate an oppressive regime trying to exterminate this new breed of creatures and forcing them underground. Violet is fighting against this, and the closer she gets to death the more determined she becomes to live! As the movie opens, Violet is infiltrating a human research centre. She has been sent to retrieve a package, which turns out to have a nine-year-old child inside. On realising that the child is wanted dead by both the Humans and the Hemophages, Violet decides to protect him.Yes, I know what you thinking, this plot actually sounds like it could be from a great Sci-fi movie, and you're right, it could have been. To be honest, most movies based on comic books usually have a great premise, and I do think that Ultraviolet could have been a great film but, unfortunately, something went wrong.It isn't Milla's fault; she looks great in \"Kill Bill-style\" outfits that seem to constantly change colour depending on her mood (I want some of those colour changing outfits!) Jovovich suits this genre as she has proved in such films as Fifth Element and Resident Evil. (I just hope that someday she will get a vehicle that will push forward her talent instead of holding it back). Milla does her best in a movie that is never sure where it wants to take its audience or even what sort of world it wants its audience to see.The movie opens by giving us quite a beautiful vision of the future. (It may be a totalitarian regime, but at least it's picturesque!) The opening scenes have quite a surreal, dream-like quality, which would have been impressive had they carried this throughout the movie. However, we are reminded that this is totally a CGI-enhanced world by constant interruptions of actual, purpose built sets. If you are going to use animation and CGI, that's fine \u0096 but you can't show us another world that's completely different from our own and intersect it with scenes that could be seen in any film set in the present day. This lack of consistency constantly stops the audience being pulled into this other world, which makes the story seem unbelievable.Also, one of the prerequisites of an action movie is elaborate, well-choreographed fight scenes. There are many action sequences in Ultraviolet, but they are all very similar. Violet is fighting off a series of masked attackers again and again. It just seems to be the same scene, only the bad guys are wearing different outfits in each battle.All in all, Ultraviolet could have been a great summer film, but too much CGI or, you could argue, not enough - is too distracting for the audience to become fully immersed in the film or the plot. Instead of going to see it, rent The Matrix, or even Equilibrium and hope that Kurt Wimmer will one day be able to improve on Equilibrium, as Equlibrium was a very promising first attempt.",

The plot was just unbelievably awful: In the future - blah blah blah - virus - blah blah blah - vampiric creatures with superhuman abilities blah blah blah - underground resistance - blah blah blah - bio-weapon technology - blah blah blah - oppressive totalitarian regime - blah blah blah - last hope for humanity - blah blah blah - cure for vampirism - blah blah blah. You get the idea. Someone clearly pressed the \"Generate Completely Derivative and Generic SF Story\" on the Sony Pictures Script Generation Machine. Mind you, it must have been broken that day because Ultraviolet had one of the worst scripts I have ever come across: Carth: \"Why wont you let anyone in?\" Violet(Jovovitch): \"Because,afterwards... these beautiful moments turn evil\". I mean really WHO ON EARTH TALKS LIKE THAT... honestly, who?Presumably when they pitched the movie they had someone saying:\"Okay, its a movie with Milla Jovovitch in really, really tight clothing killing lots of people to techno music... yes, I know there are lots of movies about people killing each other to techno music... BUT, this one has an implausibly beautiful and lethal female heroine killing people to techno music in a totalitarian state... ah, you already have 104 movies with an implausibly beautiful and deadly heroine and lots of people killing each other to techno music in a totalitarian state... AHA! But this has vampires... oh, you've got 47 movies with an implausibly beautiful and deadly heroine and lots of vampires killing each other to techno music in a totalitarian state... Er... what if we throw in a small child who develops a bond with our implausibly beautiful and deadly heroine? Okaaay... you've still got 24 films with an implausibly beautiful and deadly heroine who develops a bond the small child she has been sent to kill and lots of vampires killing each other to techno music in a totalitarian state.\" \"Right-oh, what if we film it for half the cost of the next cheapest project? Thank you... yes, we'll get on it straight away.\"I should note that this film does manages one moment which is almost worth the price of admission; Violet walks through a scanning device which immediately says \"Warning. Warning. Firearms detected.\" Then it starts scanning the weapons and says \"Number of weapons found -long pause- many!\" which made me laugh out loud. Not the best joke in the world but believe me after listening to 30 minutes of Ultraviolet's script it seems like high art.If the purpose of going to see this movie is to leer at Ms Jovovitch in some very fetching outfits then it certainly delivers. There are also a number of fairly good action sequences, the vertical bike chase was particularly notable. In conclusion, watching Ultraviolet is rather like contracting a brain tumour directly through the eyes but I must admit to rather liking this film. It is beyond mindless but it provides a significant amount of entertainment simply in terms of how truly dreadful it is.",

Out of all the action sequences in Ultraviolet, there is a particular one that gave me the best satisfaction, both as an action lover and as a Wimmer's fan. It is the sequence where : (SPOILER) Violet finishes off dozens of Asian hit-man on a rooftop using the evasion style of gun-kata, without using any gun or sword, and letting the hit-man all die by their own bullet shots. (END of SPOILER)It is perhaps the \"difference\" between this sequence (defense as offense) when compare to other sequences (all out offensive action) that made this one stands out the most.The PG-13 cut certainly has its impact on the overall action satisfaction level on Ultraviolet. Some of the action sequences seem to be tuned down quite a bit to be presented in PG13 rating. The flow is there, but somewhat not spicy enough.----- Overall : If you like action, please do go watch this movie, it has some of the coolest moments yet to be seen in action films. I went to watch Ultraviolet on the sole purpose of wanting to see its seemly crazy action sequences and special effects.I was satisfied.

As a resistance fighter Violet (Jovovich) attempts to re address the balance of power Ultraviolet comes to us from the creator of Equilibrium (Kurt Wimmer) and there is a heavy influence from this predecessor and indeed from the Matrix (which was likely to be an influence for Equilibrium in turn). Look out for a scene where ultraviolet enters a building lobby security area heavily armed paying homage to the famous matrix scene. Whilst equilibrium was an emotional action packed and stylish film ultraviolet is arguably a clear failure. Jovovich is well cast as the lead being one of the few Hollywood actresses possessing the athletic ability to deliver a realistic performance. There is a major lack of realism in the movie however. The special effects are pretty but there is a heavy dose of CGI which at times looks like animation. Fight sequences are well choreographed and Jovovich does an impressive job but she so effortlessly defeats everyone that no matter how many opponents come her way we know she will win. There is little character development and the film loses paces at times with the viewer happy to take long toilet breaks as a result. The story is not particularly original with similarities to Blade (where characters are much more larger than life) and indeed Equilibrium (corrupt official attempting to control the masses etc). The lead villain is also a boring character that doesn't really fit the bill (and has something stuck up his nose). The same could be said for the villain in equilibrium (although nothing visible up his nose) so Wimmer should really take note of this. The villain is often as important as the hero so Wimmer should put more thought into this going forward. All in all a disappointing film but visually fluid with good fight sequences that will please action comic book fans for a short evening (with a few long toilet breaks). 2 out of 10",

It's definitely the case that some movies are unfairly trashed, and can offer fun, mindless entertainment. Don't be deceived: this is NOT one of those.To summarise, the story is non-existent, the acting is awful, there is no characterisation at all, the fight scenes are on a whole new level of stupid (even for the genre), the CGI is poor and the movie is a waste of time. Milla looks good though.The story is some nonsense about a vampire disease and the failed attempts to exterminate it. The bad guys are doctors who have somehow turned into a church that has no purpose except killing vampires (who are also the bad guys) yet also rules everything. I don't need to discuss any story events because there really aren't any: nothing of any interest actually happens, and I finished the film wondering what I'd wasted my time on.The acting is awful, though they admittedly didn't have much to work with, and we never learn anything interesting about any of the characters (pfft, who needs motivations to do anything?) and therefore don't care about what happens to them.Usually, this type of film remains vaguely entertaining because of the fight scenes and mindless action. Not so here. Half of the fight scenes consist of a huge number of people in a circle around Milla, who spins once with a sword and kills them all. The rest involve them running at her one at a time, never attempting to use their weapons, and she kills them. There is never any tension or excitement, and the repetitive choreography is really dull. The few times where there are so many people that she would have to do something interesting to beat them are simply not shown. The CGI is also ridiculously bad at several points that it genuinely looks like a low quality video game.In short, even if you have liked many similar looking films in the past, Ultraviolet is almost certainly not worth your time.",

The plot, at first look, makes very little sense. Maybe it's because they cut down Wimmer's version, but I felt like I missed a huge plot point. When it ended, all I could think was, \"What?\" Hemophagia, how Violet contracted it and the rest of her history, and how both Six and Violet are still alive were not adequately explained. It has real potential, but I think the shortening of the film really, really detracted from it. It's like when they cut it down, they took out important parts that were central to the story because, having already seen it, they took the information from those parts for granted.",

How do you mess up 'superhero chick kicking ass in futuristic police state'? Have you ever watched a Chinese or Japanese movie and had the sense that the characters weren't quite behaving like normal human beings? You know, the dialogue is kinda awkward and sudden gestures are hard to explain... This is the feeling I got watching Ultraviolet. But I can forgive a foreign film for this, because maybe there are cultural differences I don't understand. This movie is simply soulless - a real pathetic thing to behold.I've never been so uninvested in what is happening. Bravo, Kurt. Even the most terrible movies have something about them I can get interested in, like bad acting or ridiculous character motivations. This isn't even laughably bad. For all the potential intrigue, action, and conniving anti-hero / villains / table-turning stuff going on, I've never cared less. For every person who showed up on the screen, I had the thought, okay, another person I don't care about. Gee, is Ultraviolet going to survive this one? Dumb.All the lines sound like exposition, and all the characters move and talk like they're in bad anime. Yet Anime can be strangely compelling. Tarantino captured the fun side of anime in Kill Bill 1. This is just sad. Okay, plot. Yes, I get it... state-created vampire terrorists vs. the ultra-secure and corrupt blood-hoarding fascist government. Little boy is the key to it all, everyone's against Ultraviolet. What potential for nuance. No nuance. Where's the heart? It's left out of the budget.Jovovich doesn't even look hot for half the shots, instead, kinda old and pudgy. But it's just the wigs and camera angle. How do you mess up Mila Jovovich? Give her insipid lines and no direction, shoot her from knee level and put trashy hooker wigs on her.Effects are terrible (like REALLY bad!) and action sequences are poorly contrived. You know how you can say about a bad movie that the sets are nice? Not here. Sets and costumes: Star Wars-rejected plastic wall panels and rubber suits from the 70's. Then there are really dumb costume choices that David Lynch would pass on. Watching Mila beat up a guy in plastic armor was the most boring thing I may have ever seen in a movie. My wife and I walked out (along with a family of 5 and 3 other couples) and thankfully got a full refund. We laughed when the theater guy said, \"too violent?\" I think we replied, \"Just bad.\"",

Milla looks delicious from start to finish, and the fights are well-choreographed, even if they stretch the bound of credulity to their utmost limits. (By a very conservative count, Milla kills about 250 people.)

Previous commentators comparing Ultraviolet to XBOX360 graphics is lending too much Ultraviolet. The CGI was poor and completely overused. In some bizarre attempt to be stylized, most scenes were confusing due to constantly trying to overload my visual senses with darks and lights and random bright and dull colors. Maybe this was done to give that comic book feel, but it failed miserably. I've been more impressed by old skool comic book art.The action sequences were very repetitive. As would be expected with a 99% invulnerable protagonist. I felt throughout the entire movie, our heroine was never in danger, not even her support characters life.The plot nonetheless was pointless mostly like most previous commentators have stated before me. Dialogue was bad also.The only redeeming quality Ultraviolet has going for it is the female protagonist. Milla Jonovich is smoking hot in every scene. If the story had a male protagonist, I wouldn't have even finished watching the DVD and just went back to playing WOW.",

She does not seem to show enough emotion towards the boy that makes it look like she cares about him(Cameron Bright). Also her hair and clothing changes color for no reason what so ever throughout the entire film at seemingly random moments. And in the future, guards are armed with swords while door locks are nonexistent even in a \"secure facility\". The reason i gave it a 5/10 and not a 2/10 was the stylized battles and gun scenes which I found were the only attractive part of the movie.

Jennifer is a much better actress, though).*SPOILERS* Well anyway the story involves an evil corporation (of course), which, from what I think I understood, cloned its leader in order to take something from his blood that would be fatal to a race of vampires (of which Mila is one, I think). This clone is a very annoying little boy who Mila decides to protect from the villain. Then, things are found out that are supposed to be a big surprise, there's a climactic battle (in the villain's huge compound, of course). All that's missing is the \"backwards counting digital display\" and the \"talking killer.\" But they tried hard.I would suggest you pass on this one. If you like Milla, she's in a few better movies. (Even the Resident Evil ones are better than this junk). I only sat through it because I like Milla; if you do, and it's on late on Showtime, or whatever, check it out if you must, but definitely, don't pay a dime to see it.",

I had enjoyed Wimmer's previous film \"Equilibrium\", and had hoped that he would top it with this one. How wrong I was! Pro's: Milla Jovovic is cute. Some of the fight scenes were pretty cool (if somewhat forced). Gunkata alone was not enough to save \"Ultraviolet\". There are some totally sweet tech ideas, such as the \"pocket dimension\" technology. However, cool tech does not a good film make.Con's: The script is awful. It is quite adolescent, and doesn't make a lot of sense. The plot is almost nonexistent. The bad guys behave in such a stupid manner as to destroy what little suspension of disbelief I still had. They use no tactics whatsoever, and the the main evil bad guy makes the stupid comment something like \"How will you defeat me? I have 700 men guarding me!\" and \"One woman against 15 men - it's inconceivable\"(or something) completely ignoring the fact she is a super-powered vampire with magic swords and guns, and they are weak, soft humans. The special effects are crappy, and the normal effects are worse. Seriously people, DO NOT use computer generated imagery for normal everyday objects unless you have the budget to back it up. Actually, don't use them at all unless your budget can make them worth using.

Usually it's unintentional, and usually it's in bad movies.Take Ultraviolet, for example. The movie opens with Violet (Milla Jovovich) in biking leathers trying to get into a top security establishment. Her hair keeps changing colour. So do her clothes. For no apparent reason. She gets into the establishment and steals a package. She defeats an improbable number of armed men, escapes by leaping through a helicopter on a motorbike, and is radioed by the head of her resistance unit en route to delivering the package: \"What the hell is going on, Violet?\" Hey, that's just what I was thinking! And this is only five minutes into the movie. I hadn't seen anything yet.Turns out the package contains a child, which in itself is a miracle considering it's the size of a briefcase and the child is nine years old. Violet rescues the kid before her boss can kill him, and the two go on the run.That's about as far as I got. The rest of the movie is partially about the relationship between Violet and the child (played by Cameron Bright, who has the same other-worldly look he uses in Running Scared, Birth and Godsend). The other part is techno special effects, inexplicable plot developments, and attempts by the director (Kurt Wimmer) to make his movie look like a comic book.The techno special effects are far too computer generated to be actually realistic. That's the trouble with CGI \u0096 some techies forget that, unless you're working on The Matrix, you kind of have to stick within the laws of physics. Or at least probability. Watching Violet surrounded by fourteen men and avoiding all their bullets through a series of somersaults does not, in my opinion, count. Again, the characters said it for me \u0096 this time it was Daxus (Nick Chinlund), one of the evil guys chasing Violet: \"One woman against fourteen men? It's ridiculous.\" That's the word I was looking for! It also describes the plot developments: how did Violet get to that idyllic garden with the child, when two minutes ago they were in a car being chased by armed men? How did Daxus get to the idyllic garden? What's the point of that thing he's wearing on his nose, when germs can still get into his mouth? How did Violet get up on that roof? Why does her hair keep changing colour? How come the kid is dead one minute and alive the next? What happened to the virus he's carrying? And the questions go on. Another one is: why are half the shots in comic-book style soft focus, and the rest clear as day? It just ends up looking like the director wants to cover up Milla Jovovich's wrinkles. It's all very weird, and not particularly entertaining.If you're drunk, sleep deprived, or in any other state where you're not inclined to ask questions, Ultraviolet is for you. To everyone else, don't bother. The gigantic plot inconsistencies and plain silly fight sequences will leave you more bemused than entertained.",

Story revolves around her adopted son, whom she gets in court in the trial versus her ex-husband Vicecardinum Ferdinand Daxus (who is major hotshot, and made enormous wealth doing suspicious jobs in large pharmaceutical company). Dax, unsatisfied with the verdict, hires fancy lawyers and constantly complaints to the court, using his influence, money and dirty tricks. Eventually, his efforts pay off and he gets his son, but then he makes classical movie mistake. He tells Violet that he doesn't like the boy, and all he wanted is to avoid large alimony. But clever Violet was prepared for that. She taped the conversation, and used it in court to counter-appeal ... and after another 700 trials won, she gets the boy back. And they lived happily ever after ...General opinion: This movie is real example how superhero comics should be made into movies. After stinking Punisher, boring Superman, a little exaggerated Hulk and a little more exaggerated latest Batman, Ultraviolet is real refreshment. During the movie I get feeling that I'm actually reading a comic. Big contribution to that belongs to interesting special effects and choreography (ballet) during fights.

True enough it was, and the worst part about this movie was that it kept reminding you exactly how bad it was. It occurs to me that Milla Jovovich has been typecasts into these roles and pretty much all that she ever starts in ends up being a fairly generic fight film. Took me three tries and I still haven't finished this movie. What can I say? When you have nonstop action that virtually makes no sense with a hot babe in the lead. The fight scenes are fight scenes and it has become her trademark yet when the entire movie seems to be done in a disco nightclub like world that virtually makes no contact or depth in the audience, there has to be a problem. I am being fairly harsh with this movie I believe however a movie that I cannot finish does not deserve a fair number.",

You get to watch me die or you force me to watch you die.\" Nice and zen. And then the weapons scan before the final conflict: \"Concealed weapons found ... many!\"There are a lot of over the top fight sequences, but these are really all about choreography and seemed good to me. The final fight is pure Darth Vader v Luke, which is really just a rehash of Errol Flynn jumping around a ship's deck waving his sword.The story is a bit confusing, and I'm sure there are a few holes. You do get the clunky exposition voice over used in most sci-fi movies, but in the first 30 mins I was still niggled at some mysterious bits that seemed more like lazy plotting rather than laying pipe for a twist. Some people are saying that's down to the final cut, so I'll leave it at that. But there is a twist and the end is satisfying and coherent.This has a real computer game feel, like Resident Evil Retribution, but is a much better experience.Plus there's plenty of Jovovich in leathers.",

            "content": "I loved Equillibrium. I had stupidly high hopes based on that love.... However, lets go beyond my bias and do a break down based on the rules of cinema: Going from the \"Hero's Story\" template, this story breaks every rule multiple times. Act one and act two are jumbled together, Act three flies every-which-way without persisting to its climax logically until it absolutely has to. This movie in short, is very confusing. Whether or not you'll \"get it\" is not relevant to how confused you will be at the end. Many things simply aren't explained. That being said, it wasn't without its attempts at wit, quirk and emotional movement...There was a vision intended for this, it was simply murdered by too much belief in special effects. A further explanation: This movie was obviously intended to have a very detailed and deep story that evolved slowly. There was no room for the story in the film, so rather than condense it, they abandoned it. No, really, they just outright abandoned it. They completely ignore story for the first act of the movie and progress with nothing but decent-to-\"oh-snap\" action scenes. None of us at that point were expecting more than a glorified action festival and those of us who were ready for it were happy.Then, it happened. The now long unused and now unwanted story showed up. But it didn't at the same time. It kind of...dangled there, hopping in from scene to other scene. Then it would leave for the action, then it would interrupt the action, then it would just be a random monologue of Violet talking to what might as well have been a wall. Eventually the action leads in to more action...but then it lets you down and literally just chooses to skip showing you the action scene and assumes you already knew what would happen. In general, you'll find this movie makes less sense on its own terms than telling Mr. Rogers to get naked on PBS and dance for the kiddies at home.The dialogue can be defined as corny. The way in which the dialogue is spoken can be defined as 'Theatrical Terrorism'. The acting itself would have been bland, but the acting with the dialogue is attempted manslaughter. The plot could be described as confusing, but combined with the other elements, it's as though someone made this film to get revenge on the producing entity. Finally, the action was either amazing or amateur. Make your decision based on that.",

Lots of cool gadgets that don't seem necessary, but hey, it's all in good fun.Set some time away in Earth's future, a mutagenic virus is released by accident which causes a minority of Earth's populace to be transformed. Not superhuman, but not quite human either. The government is basically turned into an infection control organisation. They want to eradicate all infection carriers, but of course the infected are not happy.That's basically it, no real deviation from standard scifi style. Oppressive government, opposed minority, constant action to rectify this.The action scenes do cut too much, it's hard to keep track of what is happening. Too fast paced, even for a typical action.If you want a great story, then don't bother. Shame too, as I think the actors had much more talent than they were able to display.

            "content": "I'm kind of amused by people who went into Ultraviolet with any kind of expectations. Don't get me wrong, I love Equilibrium with an abiding, passionate love, simply because it's quite probably the best bad movie of all time. How can you not love the utterly unbelievable gun katas, the mix of modern technology with very advanced technology, the huge infodumps of exposition, the incredible plot holes and the professional earnestness with which a cast of exceptional actors--Christian Bale, Sean Bean, Taye Diggs, Emily Watson, William Fichtner and Angus MacFadyen--deliver some incredibly bad dialog? Understand when I say love, it's the same kind of love I have for many of the movies featured on MST3K.So when I went to see Ultraviolet tonight, I expected it to be just as horribly bad and as unintentionally funny as Equilibrium. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. Obviously the lack of money that Wimmer whined about when talking about making Equlibrium was not so much of an issue here; the effects were actually much better.However, sadly, apart William Fichtner--who has joked about how Wimmer likes to cast him as a good member of resistance movements--the movie suffered from a distinct lack of acting talent. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for equal opportunity objectification, and I enjoyed seeing Milla Jovovich's incredibly nice butt both clothed and unclothed as much as I like the totally unnecessary, but lovely shots of Christian Bale's chest in Equlibrium. However to call what she did on screen \"acting\" is being generous and that pretty much goes for everyone except Fichtner, who had to struggle with the same craptastic dialog that everyone else did. None of the actors were helped much by Wimmer's over use of soft focus. The whole movie would been better if it had been shot with the same clean, hard lines used in EqulibriumOnce more Wimmer has taken something that could have been fun, frothy entertainment and burdened it with a confused and serious message that gets delivered to the side of the viewer's head with an anvil until you feel like Wile E. Coyote. You get the feeling that he knows nothing more about the back history of his universe than was absolutely necessary for what I'll generously call a \"script.\" And it shows, of course there are gaping plot holes because it's not about the story, which, if developed, could have been interesting.What it is about is some incredibly cool Matrix inspired combat sequences that made the most of a fit, athletic and graceful star, some halfway decent FX, and the unintentional hilarity of the worst dialog I've heard in a movie since...well, Equlibirum. Also I have to say that was one entertaining opening credit sequence. Sure, I'm sad for the lost potential, just as I was with Equilibrium, because buried somewhere in Wimmer's brain is a good story. He just needs to give the bare plot outlines to a real writer and let someone who knows what they're doing direct it.One last thing about expectations. How on earth did anyone expect an action movie that opened on March 3 to be good? All you have to do is look at Daredevil, Elektra and yes, Equilibrium to know that if Ultraviolet were actually going to be good, the distributor would have saved it for May.",

I can only imagine what he is going to have to say about this mess. He's tried to make a Matrix with the budget of Driving Miss Daisy. There is a reason the Matrix movies cost 100 Million + to make each, and Kurt has shown us that reason. Equilibrium wallowed in obscurity, probably due to having ZERO advertising budget, so no one went to see it. Ultraviolet on the other hand had a healthy ad run during expensive time-slot on network TV for at least a month in advance\u0085.HMM maybe Kurt really only had 20 million to work with to make this movie. Equilibrium was saved by the amazing performance of Christian Bale. Ultraviolet has no such savior. The acting, what little there was of it, was appalling; at times it felt as if it was dubbed from a different language. The plot was simplistic, with ZERO character development, a no sense of humor. I do hope Mr. Wimmer has another chance to make his next Equilibrium. But after this pile'o'poo I don't think it's in the cards.",

The movie is just good, contains a lot of original ideas and is in my understanding much better than The Island e.g. For a decent SciFi flick, this movie rocks and kept me very well unmaintained until the end. Sure, the CG is sometimes bad, but I see this as a concept for the adaptation of the comic to the big screen. People, don't be so single minded, be more open minded and may be you will also understand the concept behind it. However, Milla is surely a sight in this movie, the action is awesome.

Many of the scenes as well as the actors and actresses faces looked animated, and this, no doubt is exactly the look that the makers of the film were going for. CGI has already been perfected, and may have actually reached it's peak in many other movies. So the makers of Ultraviolet chose to mix reality with unreality in their images, and this 'tricks' our mind into excepting what we are seeing more easily. There are scenes in Ultraviolet when the CGI artists show that they can make things look VERY real, and there are scenes in which they flex their creative muscles to draw our mind and our imagination into the world, as Violet puts it, \"that is hard for us to understand.\" Unfortunately, visual creativity is about all this movie has going for it.",

I even went to the point of saying: \"(Wimmer's) style is phenomenal, his action, top notch, his scripts.... well, we won't talk about his ear for dialog, as I am too depressed and don't need a bullet in my head. This movie, Ultraviolet, had so much potential. So much potential. How could it have been such a mess?\" and went into a bunch of insults (wrought from utter disappointment). Now, however, I realize that this film is an example of what happens when a studio ruins a director's idea of a film and an example of an ambitious experiment. This movie, in its style (dialog, acting, story, flow, action, etc.), attempts to mimic a pulp comic book and does so very well... to a fault. The experiment, in parts, fails. Acting, for instance. We, as film-goers, expect the suspension of disbelief, something brought to fruition through believable characters and good (or AT THE VERY LEAST decent) line delivery. That is the biggest failure in this film. The line delivery, mostly that of the supporting cast, is abysmal. Which destroys the credibility of the film. Many have stated that the CGI is awful. And I agree, somewhat. It matches the style of the rest of the film. It is very block-like, smooth surfaces. Like pictures in a comic book. For that reason, I am ambivalent towards it. It fits in the context of the movie's style, but it doesn't fully work. The action, on the other hand.... I hear MANY people complain that the action is boring and dull and poorly choreographed. Here, I must call B.S. The action is beautiful. That's the only word for it. It's not gritty. It's most definitely not realistic. It's beautiful, as a dance or ballet or opera is beautiful. It's a dance with guns and swords, plain and simple. I love it. The plot is convoluted and rushed, but graspable. This fact is mostly due to the (now famous) studio edits which occurred after Screen Gems took the film (in post production) away from the director and chopped it to be a strict action movie (removing the character development and many plot points). Anyways, the movie is great. In it's way. It's not complete (Thanks, Sony) and probably never will be (the DVD will add 7 minutes back into the movie, 7 minutes out of the over 30 minutes that was originally cut by Sony...). I guess it will just exist as a beautiful reminder of Sony's bad moves. Unless they decide on a fully restored version.... PLEASE SONY PLEASE!!!!",

It would appear to be a much simpler, cheaper plan than the one he hatched. Though, there'd no longer be a reason to clone himself. He'd want to clone himself. Maybe he would make a clone and infect it so he can live on though he is sick with the same thing Violet has got. Why he has more time to live than her is beyond me. He was the first infected--why is he still alive? Unless he is a clone! They should make a sequel to explain that. Plus I want to know what became of Six and if Violet will get together with Garth.

Totally pointless, its only good side is to make Milla Jovovich look like an actress. Indeed, she outshines the rest of the cast, simply because they are even worse.

            "content": "It's been a long, long time since I've seen a movie so bad, so mind-numbingly terrible, that I no longer have the mental capacity to form words to describe how awful it is. Ultraviolet just may be the worst movie I've ever seen. I will try to put my feelings for this movie into good use before I collapse into a gibbering mess. Here goes...Ultraviolet rips off about every standard convention created by Hollywood science fiction movies (not to mention sci-fi novels) over the last fifteen years. There is not ONE original idea in this movie. Not a single, solitary unique idea. As I watched this turd, I was constantly reminded of other films like The 5th Element, The Matrix trilogy, Blade, Johnny Mnemonic, and (no surprise) Equilibrium, not to mention about a dozen other sci-fi/action movies.It starts out with a voice-over by the normally charming Milla Jovovich, where she tries to explain the entire backstory of the movie in about five minutes. Unless you've read the comic book you're not going to find any clarification of the backstory, the universe, or the characters. Somehow the director (or the editor) thought the vague voice-over would make the rest of the movie make sense. It's too bad, because a coherent intro would have made this movie much more tolerable. As it is, all the beginning narrative does is cause a lot of ambivalence towards Milla's character in the long run. Toward the end, I really didn't care if she (or ANY of the characters, for that matter) lived or died.Ultraviolet had a relatively small budget for a movie of this kind, so the director apparently decided to spend all the money on schlocky special effects instead of a decent plot or script. Do you remember that god-awful Britney Spears video where she rides a motorcycle around a futuristic city? You know, the one where she jumps off rooftops and dodges police cars? Well, save yourself some money and Google that video, because that's exactly what Ultraviolet looks like. My theory is that Kurt Wimmer bought stock footage of the Britney Spears video and then digitally inserted Milla's face.There is no excuse in this day and age of enhanced CGI for any movie to look this bad, regardless of budget. And the fact that Wimmer decided to stick with primary colors only gives Ultraviolet a very cartoonish look. I think my brain may have been forced into some kind of permanent synesthesia after it was all over. All I can see now are bright, annoying colors everywhere I look. A lawsuit may be in order.I like Milla Jovovich, and I think she is a very capable actress. That said, she lost a ton of respect from me for taking this role. Not only does it add to the growing list of \"strong yet sensitive heroines\" she has been steamrolled into playing, but her acting is so wooden throughout I thought I was watching a sentient, shapely tongue depressor try to act its way through a fourth-grade school play. At least the cinematographer had the common sense to show a lot of Milla's bare midriff. That's the only reason Ultraviolet is getting a rating of one star from me. Well, that and the fact that IMDb doesn't let you give zero stars...Yet another sore point for me was the on-screen technology used throughout the movie. Not only is it incomprehensible (even for a sci-fi flick), there's no explanation as to where, how, or why any of this technology came to be. These are the kinds of ideas that twelve-year old Star Wars fanboys come up with when they are trying to write their first short story. There is no regard to physics or standard scientific principle. I understand that is a Science Fiction movie, but I will not allow myself any suspension of disbelief when a movie doesn't even take the time to justify why Milla can fly through an air-duct, UPSIDE DOWN, only to smash through the roof and land on her feet like some kind of trippy robo-cat.Oh yeah, apparently the bad guys wear armor made out of fragile black-colored glass. That's real nifty, Mr. Wimmer. No wonder Milla can kick their butts.Maybe the fight scenes could have made Ultraviolet better, but Wimmer decided to recycle the fighting style used in Equilibrium. I really hope that he's not going to make another movie using \"Gun-kata\" again; the first time was cool, the second time was stupid, and a third time will just be inexcusable. Worse yet, the fight scenes are nowhere near as classy as they were in Equilibrium. This may be due in part to the fact that obnoxious scenery and background colors make it hard to watch a blur of fists and feet going at it.Throw in a nonsensical storyline and you've got yourself the worst sci-fi stinker to come around in a long time. At least AvP: Requiem had Aliens and Predators. Ultraviolet only has Milla Jovovich's belly button going for it.Now please excuse me while I go puke Technicolor into the toilet.",

The action was superb, the F/X were excellent - a bit spotty in places, but overall extremely imaginative and IMHO, enough to overlook the \"sub-par\" bits. Clearly there was a plot - it wasn't as fleshed out as it could have been, but it was enough to support the film.Indeed - it seems that there needs to be a Director's Cut as when you watch the \"Making Of...\" Wimmer has no part in that bit - he was apparently cut from the final release as in his vision and thus, the film that was shot, was never shown - what the STUDIO heads thought was good was shown. And I do think it was a decent film - but I would someday like to see the full feature as Wimmer intended it to be. If you're wondering: the DVD, as far as I can tell, is the same as the theatre version - I don't know what the \"UNrated\" tag means in this case - if someone DOES know the diff, please post it.This is a fantasy - a comic book brought to the big screen - so it's OK. Kinda like in the Fantastic Four: where that kind of dose of Gamma rays would kill you instantly, not make you a super human/mutant/something... but hey! it's a COMIC book and so it works - remember your old pal... IMAGINATION?I get much more peeved (amazing that IMDb considers \"pis___-off\" a 'prohibited word') off at films that take \"artistic license\" with fixed reality (e.g. Independence Day - Jeff Goldblum is overnight able to break down the alien OS and code a virus for it?! Puleeeze! It's a SciFi movie - that means they have some rules to adhere to: like the SCIENCE part... at least when they are code-breaking in StarTrek, they are using a super 24th century computer to do it - not an old Mac power book and one human brain) and foist that onto the public. I'd recommend the film - not as some intellectual bit, but as a nice bit of action-packed fluffy entertainment - view it from that perspective and I think you'll like/appreciate it too.",

It is not drama, there is little character development or redemption (after all, the writers needed to use the same character in the next issue!).To clarify the visual element of this movie, let me distinguish it from anime-style, which it is not. The people who ink comic books shade the colors, so ones eyes get the impression of three dimensions. The movie emphasizes depth, from long corridors, to reflections, to variation between distance shots and close-ups. I would distinguish this from anime, which style tends towards the visually flat (I notice this in Aeon Flux, which stylistically retained its anime roots).I believe that - if you liked the comic books - you will like this.",

In the opening we hear Violet in voice-over explaining this world of the future, Hemophages, and a big wad of back story on herself. It's really annoying to hear the main character explain herself before we even meet her in the film. It's also completely redundant because five minuets later the facts about her past are told again within the action! So, now lets talk about the Hemophages; Humanity has discovered a virus that makes people so strong that they can rip guns in half and beat armored soldiers senseless with the gun parts, and senses so sharp combined with muscles so quick that they can dodge bullets! So then what's all the fear over this virus? Is it deadly? Violet shows some slightly negative effects and says she's dying, but how? What negative effects is this virus causing in the bodies of the Hemophages? If the answers to these questions were in the film, I missed them. Then I started to notice the vampire teeth the Hemophages have and a few mentions of them as vampires. What? Vampires? They are vampires?? Well other then the teeth they have no likeness to traditional vampires, so this revelation serves only to confuse. Why the hell does this virus make people grow big incisors? This vampire thing goes nowhere and is completely unnecessary.The special effects; When we see the big CG cityscape the camera moves in a very jerky fashion, as if they couldn't lock down the computer created graphics with the image of the actual actors. It's very jarring. At least the animation is cutting edge, if this was 1993. Nothing like seeing plastic landscapes.Now, despite all this I very much liked one aspect of Ultraviolet. The technological concepts in the movie are very interesting. In the opening, the Hemophages have swords that seem to come out of their chests. This is mentioned to be Multi-Dimensional weapons. Very cool! The idea is the material of the weapons is stored in dimensions beyond our known space. Violet has small bracelets that produce many guns and ammo in a flash, seemingly out of nowhere. She also has a brooch that seems to have a tiny star inside which when activated, allows Violet to walk on walls and ceilings. Personal artificial gravity, cool. These concepts are based on our current theories of quantum physics (Star Trek eat your heart out!) Beyond this, the film is a festival of stupidity and empty-headed action. So unless you're a MSTy like me and/or an Ed Wood fan, you will hate this film.Thanks for reading,Nick Anderson~",

So, if you already know you like the same movies as me, you need not to read further.Ultraviolet is completely based on three factors: scifi-detail, CGI and Milla Jovovich. One of those I usually actually like, one I can stand if necessary and one I wish I never have to glance again. Everyone can guess which one is which.But as I said, there is nothing more on this movie than those aforementioned factors, all wrapped up in non-stop action. The scifi-detail, in this case, happens to be completely nonsential and has nothing to do with the plot. Kurt Wimmer must have watched Minority Report and decided, that he would love to do something similar. All the things person can make up in, let's say, a weekend about future's what-if's are all crammed inside this one-and-a-half-hour. Result is a list of trivia that has nothing to do with anything and most laughable dialog presently existing. CGI is always present, and it's bastard child, colour manipulation, too. Both ridiculously horrible and unjustified. This is a movie made by George Lucas on his laptop in a hangover. And what comes to Mrs. Jovovich, well... She is just as she has always been. No need to say more.This movie has everything, including the kitchen sink, crammed into it, starting from vampire clich\u00e9s and ending with a bad guy who has stuck two button ear phones up his nose. All things this movie hasn't got any, are plot, character development, timing and style.Ultraviolet tries to be sexy and violent, but it wusses away. It tries to be intelligent, witty and humoristic, but fails miserably. It tries to be stylized and revolutionary, but it ends up looking like a PlayStation game about the wonderful world of clich\u00e9s.Ultraviolet balances between unintentional comedy and painful masochism.

Amazing what a good edited Trailer can do for such a horrible movie.Ultraviolet was the worst movie I had seen (in Theatres) in 16 years! That infamous title was held by Robot Jox which I saw in the seminal Eaton Centre Cineplex back in 1990. I walked out that movie and sneaked into another movie which was just as bad, I Come In Peace, starring Dolf Lungren. This time though I did not have the luxury of leaving as I had passed the 30 minute refund mark. It had been so long since I had seen a really bad movie at a Theatre that my gut instincts were doubted.This movie looked like it was made on a MAC by some nerdy college film student! It was a freaking B Movie. B for bad acting, bad directing, bad writing and bad special effects. This movie was so derivative that it even went so low as to steal an action sequence from the cult classic Shogun Assassin!If you thought Doom was one of the best Science Fiction movies ever made and Showgirls was a cinematic masterpiece, then Ultraviolet is your CRAP. If it is, just remember to flush it down the toilet so no-one else has to see it. And for goodness sake, wash your hands!",

            "content": "This is one of those films where you ask yourself, \"What happened?\" Writer/Director Kurt Wimmer has all of the ingredients for a great action film but cannot deliver an even marginal picture. The film has a terrific opener with amazing visuals and a clever introduction of the heroine Violet. However the film quickly falls apart after the first 10 minutes. Set in a disease paranoid distant future, Violet and a group of freedom fighters struggle against the large medical corporation that wants them dead. The reason? They have contracted HGV a man made virus that essentially turns the victim into day walking vampires. Sounds great so far right? Wrong.The movie struggles with multiple plot lines of which several are left unfinished. The main plot line centers around a young boy named Six whose blood has a virulent pathogen that can kill Violet and all of her kind. Over the course of the film we learn that there is more than meets the eye with the supposed pathogen. The two characters develop a bond in a very hurry up fashion. Every theater goer could have written this plot at home. Violet once had a child of her own. It was killed and now her maternal instincts are transferred to the largely mute Six. Even stranger is throughout the film Violet racks up bodies in rapid fashion. Her character is largely a robotic killing machine devoid of emotion. The sudden bursts of mominess and a hasty explanation through blurred flash backs simply does not work.The second plot line is the corporate drug company that has taken over this sterilized future. The film has some very badly handled social commentary. Essentially they are trying to say that large drug corporations don't care about individuals. They care about profit and power. Again an interesting concept that is executed badly.Another surprise plot line emerges when one of Violet's allies Garth suddenly displays his love for her. Again it was a sub-plot that was raised and dropped in the blink of an eye.With the exception of Six none of these plots comes together cleanly. The films story and editing are put together badly. Continuity errors about in many parts of the film along with poorly used CGI and repetitive fight scenes.The fights when taken individually are entertaining to watch. Violet gymnastically dispenses justice to the baddies of the film. The fight scenes borrow heavily from Hong Kong actioners and grind house kung-fu films. The problem with the fight scenes are two fold. First while individually the fights are great they get repetitive quickly. There are many \"encirle the hero with guns\" and \"encircle the hero with swords\" scenes. You can only watch someone spin in a circle and kill everyone so many times. The film also uses a great deal of bad CGI. Without a Matrixesque budget the CGI looked very 1990's. When used subtly it actually works very well but its overuse added to the cheesiness of the picture.On a personal note while I enjoyed the fights I was a little disappointed by the overuse of sword play. If there are machine guns everywhere why are nine of the bad guys holding swords? In summation the overall film is a mess but has fantastic individual elements. Violet has dimension compressing wristbands that can pop out guns and swords. As a character Violet looks great. Milla Jovovich looks excellent for the part. There are several great fight scenes in the picture that start right in the opener. Unfortunately Kurt Wimmer could not pull of the movie. He mishandled both actors and story matter and left us with a bright technicolored mess. I recommend waiting for a rainy Sunday viewing when it comes out on DVD.",

            "content": "There were a few things wrong with this movie don't get me wrong. At times it seemed a little bit rushed and some of the plot points were a little iffy, but there were just so many beautiful scenes jam packed into it that none of that really matters.The action scenes are fast-paced and yet you can still see most of what's going on, unlike the current trend of shaking the camera around to make things seem more dramatic.The acting for this sort of movie is usually over the top and this is not really an exception: the evil guys are dastardly sneering people pretty much all the way through, and the good guys all make one-liners. But in this movie you have Milla Jovovich, and she somehow makes it all believable. The editing is rushed in some places, particularly where there is supposed to be some emotional drama, but Jovavich makes up for this for the most part by being able to show her character's pain as well as her determination.Not only Milla Jovovich but the actor who plays her aide and the child actor who plays Six are spot on. The evil people are cookie cutter villains but you can get behind the good guys even while you might be wondering in the back of your mind how moral they really are.Finally, this is not just a good action movie, but an excellent scifi movie as well. There are so many interesting gadgets that they all seem to intertwine and help make a completely different world. For instance, early in the movie it's revealed that there is something called \"flat space\" technology that allows things to be stored in containers that appear too small to carry them. In a normal scifi movie this sort of thing would be used once and then tossed aside, or it would only be used by one character, but in this movie the technology is everywhere. Everybody uses it, and this changes the dynamics of the fighting immensely.Besides the gadgets you can catch juicy little tidbits of history of the world if you pay attention. Nothing is explained in detail, but if you're like me and you like getting clues that don't break the flow of action but that nonetheless are intriguing than its...well...intriguing.The editing is unfortunate, as it does tend to make some of the scenes seem like a commercial for a sports car or a running shoe, but if you can get past that it really is a wonderful little film, containing a lot of unexpected pleasures all while centered around the simple concept of Milla Jovavich kicking ass in a myriad of beautiful and violent ways.",

Some people think there is no plot , there is , but you have to understand that SCREEN GEMS cut off 30 minutes of the film. I believe with that 30 minutes it wold be much better film because Kurt Wimmer already shown that he knows to make an excellent film ( Eqiuilibrium)witch is my one of the favorite movies ever. Fight scenes in the movie are the amazing, they did very good job. Sword fights are just unbelievable. I like the visual style of the movie.

If it were possible to vote \"zero\", a zero is what this would get. Everything about this movie is so mind-numbingly terrible, that after it's over I would imagine you'd simply pass out. I didn't get that far. For the first time in my life, I walked out of a movie. I simply couldn't continue watching it. Let's start with the plot. The usual super-human assassin scenario, but you've never seen it presented like this. The film begins with a credit sequence that could have been vastly improved, had they chosen to shorten it slightly. It would seem that everyone from the Director to the actors to the third assistant gaffer was mentioned, all utilizing a new credit technique that involves comic book covers. I'll leave it at that. The movie begins with Violet, the main-character explaining that \"you will not understand this story\". This is, apparently the only logical statement in the movie and is repeated at least once. She explains that there was some virus created (possibly by the Umbrella Corporation?) that, well what it does is never really explained. Neither is much else. You learn that she got pregnant, got the virus, and then became a super-human resistance fighter with fiber-optic hair and other pointless advances in technology. In fact pointless advances in technology, basically sum up every scene in the film. Her mission is to retrieve a briefcase, supposedly carrying a weapon, from some great big company. Every single retinal scanner, and blood tester, and eye-poker are so overblown and useless that several audience members burst out laughing. Anyway, she gets the briefcase, and it contains...Cameron Bright. And the briefcase is very small. Anyway twenty minutes and at least thirty slow-mo, non-bloody deaths later she arrives at her head office, and explains that the child must not be destroyed. She then takes it upon herself to save the poor kid, and fights more bad guys, who apparently are trained in the art of elaborate, non-bloody deaths, but not in the field of actually fighting back. (Still if I was protected by nothing but a GLASS SUIT, I'd be a bit squeamish about combat too.) And that's as far as I got. As I was leaving the theaters with my friends, I had a vision of all of us leading fellow audience members to the safety of the lobby, but I decide against it. Two other people followed us out, but the rest were determined to sit in sullen silence, contemplating what they could have bought with $8.25. Several people were asleep. And so I beg you, fellow movie lovers, don't see this film. I would not wish this film upon my worst enemy. All I know is that I will only rest easy when I see this film at the bottom of Wal-Mart's discount bin, a moment I am sure will not be far away.",

He told me he thought this film may have given him eye cancer and he wished he'd watched it before buying.The first time I saw it, I lost interest due to the weak plot and character development and ended up doing something else while it provided background noise, although I did like some of the far fetched gadgets that were being utilised by Violet when I did glance over. I want a paper phone that makes me 3D! The tardis-like storage containers would really make life easier too! I put this movie with my others and forgot about it. Then recently I decided to give it another go, because I hadn't given it my full attention before. I watched the special features first to learn a bit about the director and what he wanted to achieve with his film. I must say I enjoyed it more the second time round, although I know the directors' intentions should be clear without having to watch 'the making of'.Like i said before, plot and character development are the weak points in this film for me. I could have quite happily watched it with the sound down. Some of the lines make no sense or are slightly vomit inducing. I also didn't know enough about the characters to worry about their plight and the plot seemed like an afterthought. Parts of the motorcycle sequence were a bit jerky, like I could tell it was attached to a rig, but it wasn't so bad that it bugged me. The action sequences are vary fake and more like ballet, but it is still pleasant to watch, especially with gorgeous Milla in the centre of it all. The costumes are awesome and I like the air brushed comic-book type quality of the picture. I also loved the vivid colours. It makes a change from all the depressing quality of blue filtering which seems to be used by many sci fi movies. Human skin isn't green! I agree with people who say that Equilibrium was a much better film as far as story and plot go, but I have seen movies far worse than this. I think watching it a second time round gave me a chance to see it without any pre-conceived expectations based on more successful blockbusters. I wouldn't have bought it though, and I'm glad I didn't pay to see it at the cinema.",

Fortunately it was simply on TV and nothing was on and I had nothing to do, so I don't feel it a waste of time. I watched it in HD, and it looked real nice and some of the effects were cool. But the realism to the story was beyond belief. Yet another movie that has the essence of the holocaust, in that an eradication of a group of people who feel and think, because they are not like the humans. That is getting old also.I mean, com'on we can do better with stories than revisited themes that state the same message over and over again. Also ridiculous, Ultra uses guns that shoot bullets, yet Ultra can make them materialize from her wrists?? You'd think some kind of weapon that is more futuristic that materializes from the body itself, would be the norm, instead of bullet producing guns. The city looked pretty cheesy, but the effects of the fighting looked OK. The plot was non-existent as it was one way throughout the movie. Almost totally no sub-plots that would have (maybe) helped the story along, but this was not the case, and the acting not even worthy of a razzie award.The one redeeming thing I did enjoy, was looking at Milla, she is a very attractive woman, and sad that she did this role that I don't think was her fault, but mostly of that of the director and the story writer. Her Resident Evil movies were OK, and I really liked her in The Fifth Element.Milla is definitely capable of acting, and even one of the better fem fatales that can do action movies; I only hope that she can get hooked up with the right story and director the next time she does another action flick. I do wonder what the Catholic Church felt about this movie, since the evil dude was called the \"Vice Cardinal\", and the force he ran was definitely religious in theme, all the way down to the symbolism (like crucifixes as the logo).",

The main plot is that scientists have engineered a virus to make a super soldier. Only something went wrong in the process and created a virus that created humans with a vampire like disease. Violet Song Jat Shariff (played by Milla Jovovich) had become infected with the disease while she had been pregnant. The powers that be decided to terminate the pregnancy and she became a rebel in the process. Now the medical corporation has developed a biological counter agent, a biological weapon that supposedly would counteract the 'vampirism' by killing all the vampires when it was released into the air. The corporation placed the weapon into the blood stream of a child. This child was then kidnapped by Violet. I think that this film can be a good or bad film due to your tastes. I liked the ideas behind the technology in the film. It did seem to have the look and feel of something based in the future. While Milla's performance didn't help the film any, I don't believe it hurt either. It was a harder role to play and the plot of the film really didn't have the punch a good movie should have. The fight scenes looked more like a dance than actual fighting. I never felt any sense of danger for Violet either. She was encircled three different times in the film and with a spin of her sword she was free. Though there were some brighter spots such as the acting of William Fichtner who played Garth. Garth was a scientist who was also infected. I feel like the opening scene also was good in an artistic type of way. I liked the look and feel of the soldiers in the impervious black balls. They seemed to glide though the air in geometric fashion before crashing into the side of a building. The look and feel of this scene was very smooth. Now as I said and tried to describe this film is kind of hit or miss. For me it was more of a miss. I feel that this is a very forgettable film. There were just too many small things that in each scene caused each of those scenes to fall flat. If the fighting were more realistic the acting just a bit sharper I think that would have gone a ways to help the movie. Really I think it was a weak plot with very little side plots of any sort to help flush the characters out. Overall I just can't get deep into this movie. I would give it a four out of ten.",

It didn't develop and it didn't hold my interest. The worst thing (apart from the acting of the lead, pretty boy vampire, can't remember his name)was the special effects and the fight scenes. The special effects were so over the top it was like watching a cartoon. It is continually reminding you that it is a film, it isn't real, it isn't believable. And the scene with the motorbike is nothing more than an extended BMW advert. Pathetic. I actually ended up hating BMW more for making such a blatant advert in the middle of the film.This film should've ticked all my boxes. Sci-fi, motorbikes and Milla. But it was so boring I can hardly remember what happened in it.Conclusion If you are a Milla fan, watch it because you get to see her arse. Otherwise, forget it.",

The elements meant to make this genre strong were completely missing. The fights were tedious, leaving the viewer bored and anxious for the story to move on. It's alright to do slow fighting once per movie, but not every time a character pulls out a weapon! This also applies to fighting off a big group of armored thugs, the basis of almost every scene in the movie. The writing was horrible. All you need to know is the final fight involves someone saying, \"It's on...\" WHAT!? \"IT'S ON\"!? The best actors in the movie were the twelve year old kid and the scientist, a character that is on screen for a total of ten minutes. The dialogue was comprised of one-liners and the delivery left everyone in the theater laughing at the awkwardness. One other thing was that the entire movie was shot to look blurry. It got on my nerves quickly, that's about it. Again, I could forgive this piece of garbage if it had anything to offer, but sadly this wasn't the case. A complete waste of nine dollars.",

Another problem with this movie is the half-effort put into the special effects, in some spots I began to laugh because it was so poorly done. The smoke effects were the worst, followed closely by the flames. The animation of a building resembled that of a video game in the late 90's.

For instance some comments talk about not understanding what the consequences are from this disease (e.g. the very short lifespan of these so-called vampires). Or why the heroine is supposedly dying when all they see is a unrealistically powerful being. That important alternative beginning explains all this and more (like her troubled feelings about the young child).The visuals are great (considering this is a low budget movie) although not as \"natural\" as AEon Flux. The acting is as bad as the latter too (mainly because the lines are sometimes so ridiculous). Mila looks stunning. And the fights are quite stupid although at some occasions (near the end) the scenes strategically don't show the fighting itself (which is probably for the best). Nonetheless the movie is not that bad. If you have some spare time on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Just don't forget to see the deleted (alternative) beginning which explains most things about this film. Otherwise you'll be confused and definitely will hate this.I think that (if ever) a directors cut comes out it will be much better. As for now only see the DVD which has in the extra's section the all-important deleted scenes.Regards, EPDM",

            "content": "I enjoyed Wimmer's earlier work, particularly Equilibrium, so I was tentatively hopeful about Ultraviolet. While there were plenty of very cool bits and pieces scattered about, the movie failed to live up to its promise.The Good: The special effects were very nifty. While some people have called them cartoonish, I think that was the intension. The whole movie had the look of a live action sci-fi anime. Wimmer said that he finally managed to really bring his idea of \"gun-kata\" to the screen in Ultraviolet as he wasn't able to in Equilibrium due to time and budget constraints. While the movie never goes into any explanation of gun-kata as in Equilibrium, several fight scenes -- particularly the one with the Blood Chinois -- do show the fighting style in its mature form. And it's pretty cool. The fight scenes and the action in general were very tasty eye-candy.Finally, the plot had promise. Yes, it was another sci-fi vampire / \"genetic experimentation gone bad\" movie. But it didn't really follow in the footsteps of Resident Evil or (thank all that is holy) The Brood. There were similarities with Aeon Flux, but these were fairly superficial (female resistance fighter in a futuristic world) and incidental. The movie apparently got chopped down from 2 hours to 88 minutes. I would like to see where Wimmer would have taken the plot in those 32 minutes.The Bad: While the special effects were good, Wimmer fell into the same trap as many other good directors on their first big-budget film. He had too many scenes that used sfx apparently just because he could. The previously mentioned Blood Chinois fight scene is a good example. If Wimmer had stayed more true to his filming style in Equilibrium and been less dazzled by the possibilities that his higher budget could offer him in terms of sfx, this could have been an incredible scene. Instead, we get a ponderously long in-and-out shot of the reflections in various characters sunglasses, followed by a Matrix-style bullet-time sequence that had so many bullet trails passing through the frame it made it difficult to keep track of the characters. Wimmer could have done this same scene without much of the cgi, and it would have been much more interesting.The acting and dialogue was a bit... off. Some of the lines were a bit hokey or simply strange, but could have been pulled off with better acting. The acting itself ranged from \"okay\" to \"wooden\" to \"over-the-top\", with little room in between. Jovovich was usually in the okay range, but was variously wooden or over-the-top in delivering some dialog. Cameron Bright's performance was very wooden, while Nick Chinlund was consistently chewing the scenery. The only actor that really came off as somewhat convincing was William Fichtner (who fans should also recognize from Equilibrium). But even here, it felt off-kilter, as if some of the character's significant scenes had been cut from the film.----------Overall, it was a decent popcorn flick, with lots of cool action scenes and plenty of shots of Milla's bare skin. If you're looking for a follow-up to Equilibrium, however, you'll be disappointed. Hopefully this movie will do well enough in the box office that Wimmer will get another chance at doing a big-budget film (and will learn from his mistakes in this one).",

None of the movies I watched had as much action in it as this one.10 is a great vote for it because I just love the action and how she saves six from getting shot and killed by Nerva, the chief hemophage of all the hemophages, including Violet Song Jat Shariff. I actually didn't like the part when Violet's husband got hurt but I read the book and since she got infected when she was pregnant, he then married someone else and forgot about her.When violet looked for him, she saw him with his \"human\" wife.The book and the movie are great, you should watch it and read the book, and well, it has a lot of cussing but they go with the book and the story of the movie.",

I finally sat down and watched it after buying it quite some time ago (I like Milla, I even have some of her frankly pretty awful music), and I really enjoyed it.It's not just my slight fetish for Milla that I liked the movie. I really dug the primary-color partially CG sets, and the over-the-top 30-on-1 fighting and gunplay scenes were awesome. This is a movie where you absolutely know that you are going to be performing continual suspension of disbelief - if not, you went to the wrong movie, friend. The director showed some skill and allowed some fairly sly moments with major battles that are implied, not seen.Lastly, I think all of the folks howling about the low quality of the story should put in perspective the fact that this is intentionally a comic-book film; and I think it was a good one at that. One previous commenter mentioned the DOOM movie, and I agree. I agree in that given an appropriate expectation of a story that could be represented in flashy 2-D panels and played out by a troupe of 2-D characters, it provides a hell of a lot of fun. Now, this is a very, very different movie from DOOM, stylistically, but I think it does provide the fun, even with a bit more serious moral and tone to it.One final note: Unlike DOOM, I'll watch this movie with my 10-year-old. Yes, there's a lot of (campy, cartoony) violence, but there's virtually zero gore and no sexual objectification beyond the fact that Milla is extremely easy on the eyes.I hope this comment encourages at least one other person who might have been influenced otherwise by the abysmal rating Ultraviolet has on this site and actually give it a try - I liked it.",

The beginning credits sequence. It is a montage of comic book covers, very nicely done.

            "content": "This film suffers from having too much style and not enough substance. The film looks good for the money spent on the visual and audial style, but lacks character, feeling and an overall sense of care for the story being told. Films are meant to be entertaining and all but one must be at least a little attached to the characters in order to feel like they've been taken on an adventure, or perhaps challenged in some way. 'Ultraviolet' is entertaining if all you like is stylised violence and strong use of colours, but that'd be it.If anyone has seen 'Equilibrium' before, they should probably recognize the style of action used in almost every fight-scene in 'Ultraviolet', because it is essentially the same. The use of \"Gun Kata\" in this film is pretty much a mirror to that used in 'Equilibrium.' One could almost say that the situations that involve the use of guns and even swords are identical - the hero(ine) is surrounded by a circle of bad guys and with not too much trouble he/she dispatches them without breaking a sweat. At least in 'Equilibrium' the action wasn't trying to drive the story, and the use of such a kata (almost) seemed plausible. In 'Ultraviolet' it seems a bit too much like old hat.The dialogue in this film is rushed and lacks depth, so most of the characters sound like uneducated children. Calling someone \"mental\" sounds a lot like something a kid would say, not an ass-kicking vampire. The characters are given no time to develop at all, and in doing so give the audience no chance to relate to much of what is going on, so one may find it hard to care what happens to any of them. In most action films one can expect the villain to get killed, but in this film I couldn't wait, not because I wanted to see how or some such, just that I didn't care and wanted the film to be over already.This films \"strong\" points is that the use of colour is refreshing (yet still pointless to the story) and some of the technological ideas were interesting (disposable paper cell-phones and gravity drives). The trouble is that these things do not make a film worth seeing. I'd like to see these ideas not wasted on such a shallow type of film.Perhaps the director's cut will hold something to be desired, but I think it would take a lot to save this from being an otherwise ordinary addition to such a frequently visited genre.",

I recently rented this movie, in spite of all the bad reviews, because I'm in love with Millia Jovovich and her films. I admit that the motor bike scene was totally fake, but this is due to Millia's fear of them since the last time she was on one, in Resident Evil, she got hurt. I don't blame her at all.One comment said that the movie had no character development, but I've seen plenty. Violet and Six grow and bond throughout the movie; first six nothing but a nuisance but later developing into the lost son that Violet had always wanted. Another huge character development would be noticed is during the scenes with Garth and Violet, \"Why did you bring me back?\" Garth says, \"Isn't it obvious\u0085\" Aww he loves her. Come on my 9 year old sister got the character development in it.The movie is not bad at all, I actually enjoyed watching Millia kick some ass. Sure it could have used a little more blood when people were stabbed in vital areas, I'm giving it a 7/10.Listen people, if you like a lot of action in a movie, and not a lot of drama or comedy, this is a movie for you. I'm telling everyone of you, don't judge a movie by what others say, only you can decide what you think of this movie by watching it yourself.",

The only bad thing was the ending. Kurt Wimmer likes to end his movies with evil being defeated, which makes the movies a little cheesy.Why did I think it was good. Well the action was typical Wimmer action. It is NOT Matrix action, it is Wimmer action. The heroine (Milla) is calm cool and collective as she kills more people than anyone could count. And as Wimmer style, the enemies are always faceless.The more important thing I saw was the symbolism. Many people either didn't see it or maybe don't understand it. It is quite obvious that each character and their relationship is a metaphor for the horrors in the world. Wimmer uses Milla as the kind of evil gone good; she fights the large corporation using its power to rule the world through mass hysteria.Bottom line: This movie has almost too much action, and the characters say very little. However I think anyone intelligent will walk away from this movie contemplating larger issues and the reason for standing up and fighting oppression.",

I've heard of this one since March,and in Italy it just came this last Friday (June 16). Consider that the unrated DVD is already available . . . Not the smartest business move, but for Milla . . . So, let's see what my favorite vampire does this time: she's a hemofagus (\"bloodeater\", from Greek,and who wouldn't let her suck himself dry?It would be the nicest death, in this world . . . ), that is to say an infected by a virus,created by an unknown corporation(\"Resident Evil\") - at the head of which there's the Church - that causes the hemofagia. In other words, a virus that makes a vampire out of a man (or woman).Yeah, quite similar to the vampire virus shown in \"Blade 2\". Milla (playing Violet Song jat Sharif) design herself to protect a boy who could in some way save the whole hemofagus people from their apparently incurable situation. We discover, from clever close-ups on the wonderful Milla's gaze, that, even before the health of herself, or of her people,Violet is doing what she's doing because she is (as we understand from the first scenes) a missed mom. When she became a vampire, she lost her baby. Among this stuff, there's this insane load of fighting. Gun kata, and martial arts of all sorts. And swords. This movie is almost entirely shoot in digital,so there's a lot of Matrix influence on the special effects. The photography is absolutely beautiful. It can pass from sterile - white environments, to some other 70's - like black yellow tricks. It's really a nice show for the eyes. The other nice show, is , well, Milla. There are more close up of hers in this movie, than on the magazines she appears on. Admittely, for a fan, this is a paradise on earth. But I'm afraid the good stuff, together with the soundtrack, ends here. The plot, as you can see, is almost inexistent. That's the main bug. And, boys, that's one great bug. Lets's say so: <1>If you like CGI made movies like \"Resident Evil\" and \"Blade\" <2>If you love vampires and cyberpunk stories <3>If you're desperately in love with Milla Jovovich (like me!!) Then, the mark is what you see. Otherwise . . . Subtract a point for every topic you don't like and you'll get the most objective mark (in line with the common opinion on this site). Just for Milla'fans: don't you even dare to miss this movie!! I'm just coming from the cinema and . . . I'm paralyzed from the emotion to see all that close-ups on Milla's gaze - and not only . . .",

            "content": "I read a lot of the comments on this board before seeing the movie so I didn't have high expectations so maybe that's why the movie was better then I expected. Because based on the comments I've read on this board I was expecting a mess on film. But it was not that bad.The movie backgrounds and sets acted as if they wanted to leap into anime at times and I couldn't decided if this was revolutionary cinematography by having an anime feel in an action movie or just a product of a low budget. I'm guessing it may be both but the lack of budget is evident.Milla Jovovich saved this movie. She MADE this movie because without her there was not much left to the movie which is why I gave it a 6 rating. I liked the action scenes but toward the end I thought it was cheesy when Violet would walk into a room full of armed warriors ready to fight her, the camera then pans off somewhere and you just hear fighting sounds and the next scene is Violet standing over 20 slain people. That was just cheap movie making and just so sad it was funny.The movie felt like it was going to end at one point and I was sitting up to get ready to leave and then poof the movie just starts back up again with action scenes. What was that about? That transition was horrible.Unlike what others have said there was a plot to the movie but it was underdeveloped. But I would not mind an Ultraviolet 2 to expand and build on the plot. But they will need a bigger budget for a sequel. The end of the movie was very symbolic and spiritual (that flaming sword fight was awesome and that had me thinking long after I left the theater) and for me that was the best part of the movie. But like another poster said what did this movie have to do with vampires? Outside of the vampire teeth a few of them wore I didn't get the connection. What was interesting to me is how at the beginning of the movie it had a 1980's Buck Rogers feel then at the middle of the movie it turned into a \"Sin City during the day hours with color\" and at the end it went for a sort of Matrix type of ending. Violet dodging bullets like a spin off of Matrix was interesting.",

Well if that makes no sense to you, then neither will the tag line of this vapid piece of viewing, since they are one in the same. We start our story with some extremely conspicuous voice-overs that basically tell us half the story in about five minutes. This would be a major stylistic mistake in most films, but here, it is blessed relief. This rather lengthy narration read by both the heroine (you guessed it, her name is Violet) and her comically nose-plugged arch nemesis focuses on the spread of a disease responsible for the creation of a race of sub-human Hemophages, vampire like creatures whose major distinction is that they can always be seen wearing painfully fake dental appliances which they frequently stretch their lips wide to show off, just to make sure the viewer doesn't forget that vampires do indeed have pointy teeth. Random Hodge-Podgery of Underworld,Equilibrium,Matrix, and Aeon Flux with a dash of Power Rangers. In other words...Sucks Goat Ass!!!",

I realize it was a fantasy movie and not supposed to match up with reality, but come on guys.. this was just too much.Story line was good .. I will give it that. Easy to follow.

            "content": "what is wrong with movies today?!?! i just saw Ultraviolet, and i must say, it blew me away. How? By how much i disliked it, and actually by how much it angered me. The comic book genre these days is a hit and miss. Films like Spider-Man 2, Batman Begins, the X-Men series are all fine examples of the comic book genre at its best. But these characters are worthy to have screen time, not a comic like Ultraviolet, which now is in the ranks of such movies as Steel (the really terrible Shaq movie if you don't recall), The Punisher (both Dolph and Jane), Batman & Robin, Captain America and of course, Elektra. Now let me tell you what is wrong with it. When i go to a sci-fi/comic hero movie, i except to see great special effects above anything (any movie can be saved with great visuals), but this movie was for a lack of a better, unimpressive. It brought me back to the days of regular Nintendo and sega. The visuals were a mess, and even wearing my glasses, it felt like i needed a stronger prescription. That is how hard it was to concentrate on the screen. Now Milla is a sensation to look at in this movie. She's sexy, deadly and a force to be reckoned with. However, this movie would have been better on mute, because her acting was anything but. The dialouge was cheesy, clich\u00e9, and uninspiring. I feel bad in a way for Kurt Wimmer, the director. His previous film, Equilibrum (spelling i'm not sure of), was an intelligent sci-fi film with an amazingly talented cast (Christian Bale, need i say more?). But it seems like Kurt was living in the shadows of Equilibrum. The fight scenes were an echo of Equilibrum, and they seemed to be the same throughout the feature. I really enjoy movies of this genre, yet i feel cheated for spending the money to see this one. They should have left this one for Uwe Boll.",

Wow.Good thing there's a lot of them, too. That's this film's saving grace. You get some dialogue, some tense situation, then next thing you know there's a room full of bad guys. Then, next thing you know the bad guys are all dead; and they all go out with a bang. The way people are taken out in this movie, all the henchmen would be sitting together in heaven going, \"That was fricking amazing.\" The martial arts, the swordplay, and especially the Gun Kata v2.0 were all terrific and looked amazing.I wouldn't be surprised if this movie broke the action movie body count record (previously held by Equilibrium- 236 I believe), but it seems that there was a lot more emphasis on making great action then there was an all around good movie.If you're an action fan, don't hesitate to see this movie- it is definitely worth your money.

It did for me at least. The special effects were decent, when something blew up it looked at least a bit real, when buildings windows were smashed they did a nice job.I give this movie a 3 out of 10 cause they show it off to be this super cool action flick, when its really just a sappy PG-13 rated crap fest...DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!",

The mass fight scenes lacked the charm of Kill Bill or the special effects of almost any other cheesy sci fi film.Finally, Millo Jovavich has made some bad movies in her time (i.e. Resident Evil), but at least the plots made some sense. Hell, she wasn't even naked in this movie!!",

The movie, from music to lines, was emotional with all the subtlety of a crowbar to the back of the head, and some of the dialog made me actually wince, especially the lead actress's last line.Its strong points were the action and actors, though. Milla Jovovich did not disappoint; she looked good in decent action, even if her character's ability to slaughter dozens upon dozens of soldiers with minimal damage on her own part was excessive. Penetrate a building \"impossible to penetrate\" with only a few scratches? Still, I'll accept a lot for Milla Jovovich. Ever since \"Tears of the Sun\" and \"Chronicles of Riddick\", I have really liked Nick Chinlund, and his acting was good in this one.Don't go expecting great film-making, and the visual style and over-dramatization are excessive, but it is pretty, shinny, and the heroine kills hundreds with cool weapons. I might have wanted more, but given I saw the movie for $4 Canadian...well, still. But it entertained.",

Because she killed all the soldiers of Daxus. Which is impossible so this movie deserves a big round of applause. And a reasonable award. One time there is a scene of Violet riding in the buildings. Which is so impossible to edit well there they are, they are so good. This is a very must watch movie. Well i remember too the scene when Daxus and Violet fought, it's super cool, i mean they need to shoot it a lot of time cause it's so hard to shoot i mean in the dark? you will shot a movie?

I mean, the best parts of the movie was the butt shots and the opening credits. They obviously took a couple things from Equilibrium, like the fire at the ends of the guns during the fight scene right after her blood (witch is the ONLY blood in the entire movie) acted as some magical dye and turned her sexy, yet slightly retarded, outfit red. Still they even craped THAT up by making the flames pink! The script seemed as if it were written by a child...or a guy that looks like a child...like Gary Colmen. Of course we cant forget that hideously ugly kid from Godsend. That kid has the face of a 30 year old...or a slightly younger Marlin Brando, none-the-less id say the movie could have easily gained 2 stars just by putting a bag over his head and taping a picture of Halley Joel Osment (the younger and not \"teenage creepy\" one) on it. The acting (especially from the character called Nerva) was about on the same level as that of a 3rd grade version of Romeo and Juliet, except 3rd graders could probably do a better Russian/German/British/Australian/Cleon/homosexual accent than Sebastien Andrieu (Nerva). If it was'nt and accent than he is a disgrace to Russia/Germany/Britain/Australia/Cleon..ia/homosexual..ia. We went with Zips mom and two younger sisters and they went to see Aquamarine...honestly...i regret not going with them.

Personally, the reason I found it to be kick ass was the fact that Milla Jovovich looked really hot in it and the cool special effects, impossible fight sequences, and the general look of the movie itself (colors, inventive technology, costumes, etc..). So if you are the type that has to have a real good plot to keep your interest and think a movie is good then don't bother watching Ultraviolet its not worth your time, but if your thirsty for awesome special effects including cool fight sequences and don't want to bother with having to figure something out or think through a movie then this movie will definitely satisfy any curiosity you may have.",

Despite what you read there is a solid plot but it is a sci fi plot so many people will not understand the plot or miss key elements. These people always try to hide confusion by saying there is no plot. Also many plot elements would mean nothing to a young group. Violets obsession with six is obviously a result of her losing her child ~10 years earlier, six is about 10yo. There are of course huge holes in the plot, things that do not make sense, but not as many as in other movies. Underworld was a mess with its plot. And unlike other pseudo sci fi flicks at least ultraviolet has a science basis. Demension compression is cool, a gravity leveler is plausible. Matrix had a very implausible concept (still a good movie). Underworld made no sense (still a good movie). The most obvious thing about ultraviolet is that it is a blade runner clone, same concept. the main problem with the movie is it tries to portray a high tech future world. No movie has ever succeeded in that.all popular futuristic movies have shown decaying worlds. Showing a clean and sanitary future world is hard to do in todays world of fascination with fantasy and pseudo sci fi.

As good as tomb raider (depends on your babe preference) effects will attract those interested in euro/japan-funk",

Of course the effects are absorbing and done well but the short time scenes is the biggest weakness of the movie.

If you haven't seen it, go rent it, instead of watching Ultraviolet.That said, director Kurt Wimmer should be castrated with a rusty salad fork for his embarrassingly stupid and obnoxious homage to all things Milla.Wimmer is apparently obsessed with Milla Jovovich, to the point where he has created a film dedicated to how hot she looks in a belly-baring top and skin-tight pants. Ultraviolet is nothing more than a muddled and insipid music video, featuring Milla leaping around, kicking bad-guy butt video game style, but with no blood. They keep sending more guys against her (700 at one point) but she keeps beating, shooting or slicing them.Gosh, that actually sounds better than the film really was! But here's the problem: it's the same fight, over and over. And the entire film is so overly stylized that it seems entirely made up of Milla or others posing just before a fight, or posing in mid-kick, or posing over a dead body after a fight. It's just so much posing and no actual payoff, so it becomes monotonous.The plot is so convoluted and contrived that Milla's opening line \"I was born into a world you may not understand\" is appropriate. But by the end of the film, you not only won't understand, you won't care.And the one-liners in this film? Wow. I was aghast that the line from the trailer made it in: \"Are you mental?\" Action films are known for cheesy one liners (Arnie anybody?), but when they're as awkward as this one (and several others), nobody's laughing.I love it when a chick kicks butt. But if that's what you're looking for, rent Aeon Flux. At least that film had a semi-recognizable plot, with action that moved the story forward and decent acting.

            "content": "In what appears to be the not too distant future a massive blood war is being waged between a group of rebel super-soldiers and the government which created them.Where to begin? Let's start by looking at Kurt Wimmers' last action flick, 2002's EQUILIBRIUM. I went into EQ having heard it was very MATRIX-esquire and was totally surprised. Albeit some parts of EQ were weaker than others it was overall a great flick. So, being a fan of EQ, I assumed I would be treated to another great, underrated, stylized action movie.That being said, let's look at what went wrong with UV. I figured Wimmer would play up his strengths for ULTRA VIOLET. I was wrong. This movie appears to have been butchered in post production. I left feeling there was a totally different movie lying on the cutting room floor somewhere. The SFX were good, but they weren't to par with today's standards. The story line was erratic and all over. If you saw this film without the soundtrack you wouldn't lose a step. The dialog was at best okay. When it was bad though, well, it was awful. I found myself thinking, \"Man, the preview looked sooo cool...\" If I had to rate story and script this movie would be a BIG turkey. Thankfully, there are other aspects to browse before giving this a final rating.Now, let's peek at the good stuff. Milla plays exactly the same character she plays in every other movie and she does the best with what she was given. I don't think she will be receiving any award nods for this, but she plays the role well. The fight scenes were outstanding! With most action flicks, if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the best parts. Not so with UV. There is plenty for the over-the-top action fan to enjoy. I think if you enjoyed the TRANSPORTER movies you will also like UV. Based on fight choreography alone UV would've rated higher. Overall I think it could have used a bigger budget to iron out the kinks and smooth out the rough parts. I will probably watch it on DVD because it should have a director's cut which hopefully will flesh it out a little more.Even though some people will complain about this being PG-13, I don't think it really needed to push an R rating. There were a few instances of bad language and it had one scene of muted partial nudity. Really not appropriate for children, but 12-13 should be okay (and they will dig it). Worth a look, but don't expect EQUILIBRIUM 2. 4.5/10",

            "content": "Kurt Wimmer burst into the Sci/Fi scene with the sleeper Equilibrium in 2002, an under the radar movie that has gained a cult following on DVD, of which I am a member. I believe that with Equilibrium, Wimmer finally found the perfect combination a post-apocalyptic fascism, kung-fu, and character study, all rounded out by great acting, creative effects and choreography, and just a plain good story. In my opinion, it was better than the Matrix, and set the standard for futuristic science fiction movies. Would Wimmer's latest gun-kata fest topple Equilibrium from its throne?Hardly.Ultraviolet is the Most Fantastically Bad movie I think I have ever seen. Its like Kurt Wimmer was suddenly possessed by George Lucas and he forgot everything that made his first move good. Seems he thought he had to top everything, the fights had to bigger, had to be more groundbreaking. Hard to say if he succeeded.Ultraviolet takes place an untold of years in the future, when a deadly virus has transformed parts of the population into Vampyres (called Hemophages in the film), and the rest of mankind is set on destroying them to stop the contagion. Thats about all the story you will ever understand. This movie seems at times like the 4th film of 6, as if we are expected to know the whole story because we have seen all the other films. The downside of this is that this could actually be an interesting story of the future, and would definitely make a great novel in the right hands. So, for much of the movie, the audience sits there with a dull look in their eye, and just says, \"Huh?\"So to distract you from the barely nonexistent story, there is all the awesome, groundbreaking effects and fight scenes, right? Sure, if they had not run out of money halfway through post production. The effects in the beginning action scenes seem like the previs used on PS2 games. At some points, the objects on screen (like a flying motorcycle) actually start to jitter through the scene. The fight scenes are extremely unrealistic, with occasional exposition to explain these unnatural acts. Where in Equlibrium, when Wimmer was bound by budget constraints and had to creatively use camera tricks and ACTUAL martial arts to film his intricate fight scenes, Ultraviolet uses CGI and green screens to join the overfilled basket of computer effects laden flops....So why, you ask, did I give this movie 5 out of 10, when it seems nothing went right, and its a complete waste of film? Because of how self aware the film is. Its almost laughable at points how bad the effects are, how lopsided the fighting, and how cardboard the acting is. Yet there are times when Kurt Wimmer throws in some snippy dialog to make fun of his own movie, that you cant help but laugh at. The soundtrack is of ultra epic proportion, and drives the fight scenes with store bought zeal. So, is Wimmer a genius, making the most deliberately, awesomely bad movie since Space Balls, or has he crossed the line into insanity, forgetting everything that made him a name in Hollywood and blindly doing whatever the hell he wants, because gosh darnit, it his movie!Ill let you decide that one. But there were good points. Milla Jovovich looks positively stunning in the various Lycra suits she wears throughout the film. And Wimmer has finally solved the age old problem of the bottomless clip plaguing todays action movies: wristbands that pull guns out of thin air, and supply an endless run of ammunition! Genius! Did I mention Milla Jovovich was hot?So in the end, Ultraviolet was a supremely disappointing followup to the best SciFi film of the past ten years. I am still shaking my head at just how bad it really was. So now I go home, and wait in vain for the next thinking mans sci fi movie.",

            "content": "Last Sunday I took roughly 2 hours of my life to watch Ultra Violet and let me say one thing. I was shocked. It is probably the worst action flick I have ever seen. I was expecting nothing more than raw, mind-numbing violence and some flashy CGI graphics. Those expectations were stimulated, no doubt, besides the effects being below the standards of what would be tolerated even in an episode of Xena:The Warrior Princess. This leads me to the thing that bothers me even more about this film. There are so many things in this movie that makes absolutely no sense at all. I must admit that I have neither made, nor cared to make, any amount of research on the Ultraviolet comic book series. You know why? The comic book series, \"Ultra Violet\", does not even seem to exist! Oh my! What clever producers! \"We'll insinuate that the people who watch Ultra Violet can get some answers by reading the comic book series... But they can't, because there is no such thing! (followed by an incomprehensible maniacal laughter). That being said, I would like to state the thing that bothers me the most about this awful film, and one of the things which makes the least sense of all. Throughout the film, Ultra Violet's arch enemy Daxus can be seen with some kind of device stuffed up his nostrils. Is it some kind of device that will prevent him from being infected with the \"plague\" ? Even though he, with the super-human reflexes and all, seems to be affected already ?. Has Daxus' nasal cavity suffered some irreparable damage from doing some drug which side effects were perpetual madness.(that would explain a lot). In that case, it's not even typical \"Bad Guy Wants To Take Over The World Madness\". No sir, it's \"Crazy Mumbo Jumbo I Don't Know What I'm Doing And I Don't Care Madness\". Mayhap the makers of this film just put it there for no particular reason at all, as if to say; \"We know this crazy film makes no sense at all, so why not make it even crazier!?. I guess we will never know for sure. Not even the deleted scenes held an answer to the above stated question (even though it seemed to clarify a great deal about the background of Ultra Violet, the plague and actually gave the film a slight ounce of meaning - which the producers deemed worthless of course). I'll end this comment with a quote from the movie, that was made by Nick Chinlund(Daxus) when he was told that horror was going to continue for 20 more minutes; \"Are you mental!?\"",

Sadly this is not the case and the artificial environment with weird 3D physics present everywhere is just a cherry on top of a really strange cake. Equilibrium was a success and the director/writer Kurt Wimmer did a good job on that one, unfortunately for the last time. It's probably a good thing that he continues his career as a writer, because he's good at it. I recommend watching other movies by the author.",

I will say that Daredevil was a better movie than Ultraviolet. Normally i wouldn't be able to bring myself to insult anything that much, no matter how bad the movie was. so from now on the ultimate insult to a movie is going to be i would rather sit through a 12 hour marathon of ultraviolet. the only thing that got me through the movie was the fact that it was so bad it was like watching a train wreck you just cant look away. the dialog was a bad mix of Dark Angel and Dark Shadows it was hysterical because you knew they were serious when writing it. i am not kidding when i say that the people who work in the theater instead of saying hope you enjoyed the movie said refunds are available downstairsthis movie is not even a rent it.this movie is a bury it in your Netflicks account. so if it shows up watch it so you will know how bad it is for yourself. but please don't go out of your way to see it!!!!!!",

The general look, structure and soundtrack of this movie clearly keeps this well in mind and to my opinion it succeeds quite well in importing some of the style of the Japanese comic books and animation. Another movie before this one tried that with less success at that but with a much better overall result: The Matrix. Most reviews have justifiably remarked the films less-then-stellar acting and the so-so story. So yes, this movie has many defects, like so many of the comic books, manga and anime it tries to imitate. But also, like them, it entertains with amazing action sequences, original and colorful visuals. Think of it like a cartoon/anime for teens and adults. If that doesn't fit your taste, skip it.",

I was never a fan of Milla's acting skills (though she has improved since the start of her acting career - try watching 4th Kind) but I have always liked director Kurt Wimmer and his Equilibrium and had big hopes for Ultraviolet too. Sadly, I was disappointed. A story itself has a potential but the script is weak, characters are dull and it seems like actors had difficulties playing their roles. The only good actor in this film is Cameron Bright playing Six. This boy shows promise and is going to become a great actor someday. Ultraviolet has lots of CGI but this and choreographed Gun Kata and fight sequences save the movie. My recommendation? Watch this if you are a fan of Milla Jovovich or just want to spent an evening looking at impressive futuristic images not looking for a meaning. If you're looking for something better and more meaningful, stick with Equilibrium instead.",

I felt nothing for Violet when they got her to the emotional scene. (this is really bad considering the animated younger Lucy Liu in Kill Bill Vol.1 can actually make me feel sorry and sad for her character, and some more, that is an animated part!!!) Really, i feel sorry for Milla, as i'm a fan of hers. Liked her in The Fifth Element and Resident Evil series. She can act as well, just that the script written for her disadvantaged her acting skills. Really bad!!! Worst movie i've ever seen in my entire life, as i really can't recall any worst Hollywood movie, probably there were none. This is the first!

I have to disagree.IF one is attentive, there is mention more than once about \"converting with low light sensitivity\", and one can infer that the hemophages that didn't convert with such were nicknamed vampires, since they were much more sensitive to light...There are more than one plot formulas that are intertwined in this, but one will probably miss most of them if one is merely paying attention to Milia Jojovich's skintight outfits ;) Judging it on it's own merits, this movie is surely not the next Star Wars, but certainly worthy of an entertainment, especially if one liked any of the Underworld series movies.

It's well shot and edited, the leads are very good - Mila Jovovich is always lovely to watch, and having seen him in a couple of films recently I would expect great things of Cameron Bright if he should choose stay in acting. The plot isn't full of twists - just a couple. It's reasonably straight forward, and at the pace this film moves it needs to be.In any kind of comic book plot, you can't expect too much reality, and the cgi sets and set pieces didn't bother me so much, as they seem to have really upset some viewers!

Plot holes and unexplained portions made it almost unbearable to watch some parts. The action itself is mediocre at best and apart from the clich\u00e9 ending fight sequence left plenty to be desired, not only that but they become EXTREMELY repetitive and roughly half the time they show \"Violet\" approaching 25 armed men and they don't even show the sequence, you'll be thankful for it early on.

Adding insult to injury (as well as to viewers intelligence) this omnipresent CGI is also horrible by todays standards (Many video game graphics look better).The list goes on.There is a hint of some kind of subtext but it is hammered in in a very ham-fisted way and does not really have any kind of impact on the \"plot\".Side note: While I was never a major fan of Equlibrium (also too repetitive) it is a much better picture.

            "content": "I made the mistake of looking forward to this film, since I enjoyed Kurt Wimmer's earlier film, Equilibrium. I was very disappointed, since Ultraviolet is so bad, it cannot even be enjoyed as a guilty pleasure.From the opening sequence with its expositional monologue that really doesn't do a very good job of setting up the premise, to the outlandish fights and gun battles (and there are a lot of 'em) that make even the acrobatic exploits of the lovely Milla Jovovich tiresome, there is pretty much nothing about this movie that actually works. The dialog alternates between awkwardly stiff and howlingly stupid - at no point do you actually believe that real people would say these lines. The main plot, involving what is essentially a McGuffin, doesn't appear to be understood by anyone in the film, and maybe not by the writer/director, either.There isn't a single scene or plot in this that is the least bit original, a crime which could be mitigated by creating a good movie, but this is so far from that mark that it's just pathetic.Is there anything good about it? Well, the cinematography, art direction, set design, and production design are actually pretty good. The opening credits sequence is wonderful (which unfortunately makes the actual film seem worse in comparison). Milla is fun to watch in her first few fight sequences, and William Fichtner attempts to bring a little dimension to a character that is on-screen very little.Should you pay to see it? No, I'd suggest you wait for it to air some Saturday evening on Sci-Fi in a little while, where it might seem like a breath of fresh air after several weeks of bug movies.",

What works fine with that genre just doesn't translate directly to the movie format. You have to tweak it. Which these guys didn't do. As it is this film just keeps going over the top. Unfortunately I wasn't expecting a comedy... Hence the bad grade.The sad part is that this could had been a good movie. If you would had cut about third off this movie, removed the most corniest lines from the dialog ( during the first quarter of the film, when they are on the roof... damn, now that was just bad...)and made just small alterations to the script... Plus the goddamn continuity problems, disappearing and reappearing jackets and shoes...Mostly I blame the editing. I don't know when this production went shout but I know that this movie has been cut more than a victim of Jack the Ripper, and the scars are showing.As it stands now, ultraviolet doesn't really feel like a true comic style made movie (like sin city), nor does it feel like a scifi action flick that you could take seriously. It has the visuals but it doesn't have the style. It has the action, but it doesn't have the credibility.This movie sucks. And I suspect that the directors cut with the extra 30 minutes will suck even more.",

The last movies I really cared to watch on a big screen was Chronicles of Riddick, and while I have seen others since they were not that good. Ultraviolet did remind me of Japanese anime just not any film in particular. The plot is a bit generic and the dialogue seems rough, but the visuals are good, particularly the lighting. Lighting props and scenery determine so much of the mood, as well as add what some call a wow factor that when they are done poorly you really notice. Some of the shots of the city from the air were not good but I can ignore that, and so can you. Another piece with lighting that is interesting is the Dune miniseries done by the Sci fi channel which every should see at least one if it is there style. So to sum up, if Sci-fi action is your thing, or perhaps just Milla then go for it.",

I couldn't believe half the stuff they were saying. \"Are you Mental?\" \"Oh its on now!\" Give me a break. I also have yet to grasp the way weapons seemed to come out of them; in what time would that ever be believable. Basically this movie seemed to me like a Video Game where the heroine has to fight lots of similar people as she moves up to the big boss character and they goes after him. The plot surrounding the video game is unclear and underdeveloped, but it doesn't really matter because in the end she kills a lot of people for a purpose that i have yet to grasp.",

            "content": "This film is the Hollywood debut of the comic book heroine Violet. In this movie the dystopian world is divided into hemophages and normal humans. The hemophages, including Violet, have been infected with a blood disease which gives them superpowers and live in a world where they are feared and treated as second class citizens. The president of this world is probably intended to be a caricature of George W Bush as he plays on the public's fears and anxieties to try and remain in power. A young boy becomes caught up in the struggle between the hemophages and the government and Ultraviolet must try to use her combat skills to protect him. Ultraviolet's strength lies more in it's visual appeal than in a careful consideration of it's plot. This movie is best viewed as an entertaining piece of visual effects mastery than a thought provoking dystopian world. The high octane chase sequences are visually stunning enough to make your head spin and the design of sets and costumes is striking to the eye. Milla Jovovich provides male viewers with some attractive eye candy as she moves with sensuality and style through every scene even if her character may not seem to have much the female viewer can identify with. Fight scenes and martial arts sequences are well choreographed although the viewers may feel they have seen a very similar kind of action in other films such as Elektra or Buffy the Vampire Slayer. For example the heroine managing to miraculously defeat a large number of attackers simultaneously. Indeed the main character of this film appears very similar to Elektra right down to her hair style and blood red outfit. Ultraviolet fails to deliver anything new to it's audience as we feel like we've seen this type of storyline and heroine so many times before in this genre. It appears that little effort has gone into the writing of this film and as other viewers have commented I felt that the purpose of the characters and direction of the plot was unclear at times. Ultraviolet's plot is very clich\u00e9d and unoriginal seeming like a substandard version of Elektra crossed with X Men the Last Stand. Despite it's faults it is still worth a look for fans of the comic book if only for it's visual appeal.",

It's understandable that most of the story was a bit lacking, but there again this is a neat action movie. It had a better story and was easier to follow and understand than Steven Seagal \"Forigner\" movie. However, i guess this is more based for a fan of the director, rather than trying to find a good movie on a late Friday night.I still give it an 8 out of 10. When I saw this on opening night in theaters, I knew from the start there was going to be nothing but flashy colors, gun battles, and Milla Jovovich to keep me entertained. Let alone i was more interested in how Kurt Wimmer developed his fighting style \"Gun-Kata\" than anything else. It's not a Hitchcock film, but it's not a movie to be shot down, purely based upon low story..",

This DOES NOT work and they prove it. It was VERY reminiscent of Equilibrium but not in a good way. Oh well, they can't all be winners. Another thing is the dialogue. There are definitely several examples where the dialogue is just plain corny. There are ways to get around a bad story line with good dialogue, but they just made it worse. Also, there are times when the dialogue could have been good (the subway scene) but the way they edited her tone to make her sound uber serious makes the scene extremely corny and emotionless.

            "content": "Um ... Jesus, where to start? First off, \"Ultraviolet\" is the latest sci-fi action orgy from director and screenwriter Kurt Wimmer. After the smashing success of his first movie of this genre, \"Equilibrium,\" Wimmer managed to find the most gullible producer in Hollywood to let him make another.The film stars Milla Jovovich (\"Fifth Element\") who plays a sheet of balsa wood named Violet, a color-changing bombshell who has an ax to grind with the people who turned her into the vampire of the future. To grind said ax, Violet pulls upon every computer-generated trick in the book and beats up every stuntman in the world.First off, yes the action was dope-awesome, but even smoking a quarter ton of weed couldn't cover up the shallow plot and \"pays the bills\" performances. Plus the action scenes become repetitive by the third one (I think I counted 24). A fight starts out with Violet making a dramatic entrance. Faceless men surround her. Forty-five seconds of my life wash down the drain. Then it ends with her standing in an action pose surrounded by corpses.Second, it says a lot about a film when the biggest name is Milla Jovovich. True, she was in \"Fifth Element,\" but she spoke in gibberish for half the film and spoke little once she learned English. She did play Katinka in \"Zoolander\" \u0085 um \u0085 Then there are the \"Resident Evil\" movies \u0085 I can't think of a single reason why she gets any work at all\u0097wait. Maybe it's because she has a body like Milla Jovovich's.The biggest problem was that the movie never compelled me, let alone the rest of the audience, to care about any of the characters in any way. We all had a good chuckle at the \"dramatic\" scenes. And without an interesting plot, I found that I'd rather go home than watch the final showdown between Violet and the villain.The silver lining? Again, any time a movie can put food on that many stunt actors' tables a tiny parade is held in my heart. Same goes for seeing William Fichtner (\"Invasion\") on the big screen.But by all means, don't consider those things good reason to see \"Ultraviolet.\" Don't rent it. Don't get it from Netflix. Return it if it is given as a gift. People should only watch this movie if they have no choice, like if they're paralyzed from the neck down and the nurse has abandoned them in front of a television turned to the Sci-fi Channel.I don't even remember why I went to see it in the first place. I guess because I needed something to complain about. Whatever, I'm going to watch \"Serenity\" now to wash this horrible film out of my head.P.S. Watch \"Mirrormask.\"",

These are codes of expression borrowed directly from comic books. This film, more effectively even than _Sin City_, brings the actual look and feel of a comic book to the screen. In this respect, it was excellent, and I had a lot of fun watching it.That is also the film's failing, however. It misreads its audience pretty badly and in my theater there were quite a few people who laughed openly during the more serious sequences.

However, if you are an action or fight or chase scene junkie this movie might just fit the bill. Milla Jovovich (Ultraviolet) partakes in quite a large amount of running and fighting, with grandly laid out fight scenes and intense chase scenes. So, if you don't care much for story lines, and live for those long fight scenes or intense chase scenes, \"Ultraviolet\" might be the movie for you, but those of you who need a substantial storyline or are sticklers for details might want to steer clear of Kurt Wimmer's most recent creation.",

If you liked underworld, you'll dislike this, and if you hated underworld like I did, you'll despise this.The special effects were incoherent, the dialogue was as corny as an Indiana farm, and much of the acting was rather lame. Some of the scenes were so outrageous they were totally ridiculous and unbelievable (i.e. the motorcycle chase scene)and about halfway through the movie you'll probably find yourself wishing that it was over.It might not have been so bad if some other things had made more sense. For instance, why do modern movies insist on putting in sword fights were sword fights are not necessary. If you have a gun you do not need a sword! I know there are exceptions to this rule but this movie did not set itself up properly for that exception. And even when swords do show up, there should be a realistic fight scene, and none of this \"I am so mighty I can take you with one blow\" crap. I am so sick of that cop-out. There is no way one woman can take eight equally matched people, surrounded no less, then swoop the sword once and kill them all.Maybe if less had been spent on CGI, and more on buying a decent script, and maybe teaching the director some fundamentals on how to make a shot without a close-up, they would have done better.I don't think I'm stressing enough how important it is not to pay to see this movie. Whatever you do, try to find a way to see it for free (legally, of course).And one last thing: the trailers misrepresent the movie.

Get over it.)Truth be told, I wasn't; not by a long shot.The only reason why I didn't give this movie a flat-out 1/10 is because the movie was VERY pretty. But that's even limited. I found the bird's-eye city scenes to be either so artistic to that they just looked like a three-year-old's art, or just flat-out lazy. At the end, when the glass dome was being broken by the fire, the fire actually CLIPPED the unbroken class- i.e. it went through solid glass, a very tacky and careless error.Milla Jovovich was the only thing that made this movie even bearable. That being said, the director forced her into a character that just didn't suit her. When they were on the metro while evading the government, she kept on talking to Six in a way that just struck me as very weird, and very unbelievable. Certain parts of her character fit her like a poorly tailored suit, as opposed to her roles in the Fifth Element, and the Resident Evil movie.The story line was terrible. Basically, It was this girl who had been turned into a vampire (\"hemophage) by a virus (not a new idea in the least). She fights a government that's run by medical staff (with a religious bent? See: the titles of the officials + the omnipresence of a crucifix). The government has a new weapon that is rumored to be able to end the \"Blood War\" once and for all. She nicks it, and it turns out to be a child, who carries a virus/protein/ misnamed thing that will wipe humans from the face of the earth, unless they pay money to the government for a vaccine. She also finds out that the head of the government that's been trying to kill her and her people is also a hemophage (also not a new idea). She kills him, turns the boy into a vampire, the end. My issue with the storyline is not that it's stale and uncreative, it's that the script writer should be shot. No aspect of the part was allowed to develop completely. Also, Milla Jovovich's character is basically in god-mode 24/7, see: her ability to take, what, 10 of her kind out in one swoop, and then kill 21386y928167487126450126412879042 humans without sustaining any major injuries to speak of. And what is up with her ability to change color? This, among numerous other aspects of the film, was never explained.If I had to sum this movie up in two ideas, it would be: Milla Jovovich's Navel, and one long, badly done action sequence.If you want to see a movie about a dystopian society ruled by a tyrannical medical organization, see \u00c6on flux.If you want to see Milla Jovovich at her best, see either Resident Evil I, or the Fifth Element.This movie is not worth your time. If anything, this film was far too ambitious in the amount of content it wanted to cover for a 1h40m film.",

Certainly no academy award material, but I don't think that's what this movie was made to be. This movie was made simply to be visual in my opinion. The fight scenes are very original and well done, the color mixings are so vibrant and the costumes and scenery are flawless.If you want to watch this to enjoy it, turn it down a bit because there's no point in paying attention to the dialogs, so you can talk to whoever your watching it with, and smoke a joint.",

Also the special effects are also way to exaggerated, nothing in the movie is actually real, even the peoples' skin colors are modified, not to mention every set or every place where action take place. Plus every combat scene has like 1% non-special effect in it.

I love all types of movies; romantic, comedic, dramatic, and action. The movie I saw tonight fell under a genre of movie that I hate - SH***.Before seeing this movie, I was unaware that Kurt Wimmer was the director of this and Equilibrium. I had heard of Equilibrium from a friend and loved it, thought it was as good if not better than the Matrix; story and action wise. I had thought, however, that this movie was very reminiscent of Equilibrium and expected it to be great. Well, now knowing what I now know, Kurt committed suicide with this movie. What was he thinking? Please, someone tell me. The acting was 100 times better in Equilibrium, ESPECIALLY the dialogue. The CGI was horrific at best; it was like watching a DVD that had been drug on cement for about 10 miles - very choppy. The scenery was TOO clean. Yeah, the scenery was about the same as Equilibrium's, but it wasn't as glossy in Equilibrium. The scenery in this movie played tricks with your eyes because of how glossy everything was.OK, first off, the kid (who played in Godsend and was great in that movie) did NOTHING in this movie but take up space. Milla could have been making better movies than this movie. Fichtner has been in way better movies as well. Milla and Fichtner, as well as the kid, may have messed up their careers with this movie. I would have had a more enjoyable time getting kicked in the jewels than watching this movie. I cannot stop thinking about how horrible this movie was, seriously.Have you ever seen that Burger King commercial where the guy was saying he was the King of Cheesy? Well, you'll think of that commercial a few times when watching this movie. The beginning comic book thing was interesting,.......wait a minute, no it wasn't. I registered to comment about this movie to save an hour and 25 minutes of every persons life that I could. I have never been so disappointed in a movie.They could have done without the vampire thing, it did nothing for the movie. The action scenes were highly unbelievable, so unbelievable that you couldn't watch them. It was more interesting looking at your watch and thinking about what you were going to do tomorrow. The story was linear, but at the same time, it was choppy. The acting was horrible. I can seriously say there was nothing about this movie that impressed me. Yes, we can compress matter so we can somehow make a gun out of nothing. I know it's not fair to do this, but it's scientifically unrealistic. This movie was a sad, sad, SAD attempt at an action movie. I've seen that some people gave it a 10/10, how? I want to know what movie you were watching, cause you certainly didn't see the same movie I saw.My friends and I want to buy this movie just to destroy it. It will haunt my dreams for weeks to come. Someone that commented on this movie was right about seeing it with your friends so you can laugh about how horrific it was. I gave this movie a 1 because you couldn't give it a 0. I do not recommend anyone to see this movie. The only thing this movie is good for is it's ticket stub to give to your parents if they ask where you were, when you actually making out with your boyfriend/girlfriend. Even then, it may not be worth that. I'm glad I saw 16 Blocks before it, that made the day worth while. If you see it, or have seen it, I'm sorry. But if you haven't seen it, for your sanity and to save an hour and 25 minutes of your life, don't see it.XIN",

I was expecting a triumphant return of Gun-Kata, with a similar atmosphere that I liked in Equilibrium, but now in hindsight, it wasn't nearly as good as it's predecessor. I'm quite disappointed.I don't like to badmouth movies, so let's start with what worked. Milla Jovovitch is always fun to watch and the action sequences were well done, I was actually quite impressed with a scene where Violet dispatched a dozen or so guys by just dodging the bullets and letting them hit her enemies. Sadly, the negatives outweigh the positives. I went into the theater not expecting a dramatic story with an excellent plot, but one that at the very least could move the action from point to point intelligently. Ultraviolet did not do this. The pacing was WAY off, and the script was filled with campy dialog and cheap one-liners. Plot twists were predictable, and the whole mother-son thing between Violet and the boy just didn't work. In an action movie you need at the very least a bare minimum of plot to keep things moving...Ultraviolet went well below that level.And for an action movie, one that is supposed to give us beautiful fight-scenes, we are deprived of some potentially very good shootouts and duels, particularly when Violet breaks into the villain's base to rescue the boy. The \"next great lobby scene\" is a particularly painful omission. Violet walks in, we see that she is strapped...and then it cuts away...*cries*.I'm not even going to go into the effects and graphics. After seeing the opening credits in comic form, and then saw the very blocky scenery, I had assumed that it was supposed to be \"comic book style\"...then I noticed the poor green-screen work and low detail.I'm still not going to give up on Wimmer, I REALLY wanted this movie to work...but the lack of effort on many parts of the movie doomed it from conception.My suggestion; if you like gun-fights, then it is best not to wade your way through the rest of the movie just to see an accumulated ten minutes of fighting. Wait for the DVD, skip straight to the fights, then return it to your video store.",

But you quickly realize this story is more about fight sequences and close up face shots than anything. In fact, it's more like soft core porn.

It's too obscurely arty for mass market tastes, and for most action, scifi, and comic book tastes.The unrealistic fight scenes were dances--metaphorical stage choreography.There was a reason the plot made no sense. There had to be absolutely no reason for Violet to do what she did other than honor. With practical reasons, her motives would have been less than pure.The Samurai always slays common fighters in droves in battles so outrageous as to be mythic.The villain was your classic corrupt government official slash Ronin. His motives had to be nothing but power and personal gain, everything possibly honorable about his point of view had to turn out to be a sham. He had to be not simply a bad guy, but an anti-Samurai.Then to try to Westernize it, they threw in all the Christ v. Anti-Christ symbolism---the villain the corrupt Archbishop, the Heroine a maternal sort of Angel with a Flaming Sword. Hell, the kid even came back from the dead after his death on the cross.Overblown to hell and gone, but that's the point. It's a wild, over the top, larger than life, Samurai hero tale.If you aren't familiar with enough of Japanese history to understand why Samurai tales work the way they do, you won't understand this film and you'll probably hate it. If you *do* understand it and don't have some kind of appreciation for the romanticism of Japanese Samurai stories, you'll hate it.Sure it was cheesy and gaudy as hell. It was supposed to be. Such tales are.I gave it a 7 because I thought the Christianity references were the one pattern in the movie that should have been subtle.It's not a bad movie. It's not a movie that you're stupid or common if you don't get it, or if you get it but still hate it. It's a reasonably good B movie for a small niche audience.",

Maybe not the worst thing given you can always pick holes in realism of most Sci-Fi films if you try.As for questioning Daxus & His apparent germophobic paranoia, well I think that can easily be explained by a bit of lateral thinking but I won't introduce a spoiler into my comment.I would like to think that the film is tongue in cheek given the delivery of a lot of lines, on the whole a fun, even if not exactly intellectually challenging 83.57 mins!!!",

When the bad guy's best line in the big fight scene is \"oh, it's on\" that's about it. I did see a lot of similarities between Equilibrium and Ultraviolet in that they both take place in highly regulated police state type societies. The main character who is unemotional now becomes emotional (though there's actually a fleshed out character to be had in Equilibrium). Main character wears black until near the end when he/she wears white and kills all the soldiers in the building. Main character has super special fighting skills. That's about it.

The use of CGI doesn't bother me unless something is put into the movie with no explanation. Such as her ability to walk anywhere device. I don't like when movies are put out with the soul purpose of making it because it's based on a comic book. It seems that people will either like it or extremely dislike it. I'm not sure if they did it because of the wonderful reception of the Blade movies or just because people have been eating up all the comic book movies.

I know that Mila is not the perfect actress, but at least she acted more convincingly in \"Joan of Arc\", \"The 5th element\" and the above mentioned \"Resident Evil\", but here she didn't even provides a minor diversity in her acting...

For one the plot seemed to revolve around one big long action scene after another, be it riding bikes on the walls of office buildings to evade choppers that looked like poorly rendered 80's computer game avatars to the fact that for some reason Mila Jovovich's hair refused to stay the same color for more than about 5 minuets...I'm talking agony hear.

Not only was this blurriness distracting but it takes away from the \"performances\". Why not just make the whole movie 3d is that's the desire? There is some semblance of a story but it is irrelevant. All the liners are trite and redundant. The fighting was sub-par and composed mostly posing - shots of Milla's hips, buttocks & belly. Furthermore, why would seven hundred soldiers line up in two neat rows? That's not good strategy for battle. One bullet could take out a whole row. A lot of the inspiration for these action sequences seemed to have been Matrix inspired. It's a damn shame that the Matrix has ruined movies, essentially. Do not forget, the Matrix takes place in an artificial reality where the impossible can be forged.I highly recommend that you stay away from this movie at all cost.",

Quite a few of the special effects were jaw-dropping. I wish those effects were in another movie.I know what this movie was trying to do. It's fundamental flaw is that Ultraviolet tries to hard. In trying to be edgy it makes itself a blunt instrument. Ultraviolet tries to be a mysterious, but it's a mystery to me why I should care.I understand the cut of Ultaviolet I saw was massively re-edited by the studio. I wish I could have seen a director's cut of \"Ultraviolet\" initially. After what I've seen however I have no desire to waste even more time on what I think would only be marginally better movie. The writing was poor, direction was marginal, and the acting lackluster excepting Nick Chinlund as Daxus who was wonderfully menacing.My final criticism is that there should be some funny or amusing moments in an action movie, one or two laughs and I would have given this movie a 5 instead of 4.",

The story even mirrors that of Equilibrium... the oppressed society right down to the \"revelation\" at the end dealing with the main baddie. The over use of CGI and total disregard for physics and plausability was bad. I love a good sci-fi flick as much as the next person, but this movie cannot stand on its own.

That being said, the Kurt Wimmer who wrote those is not the same guy who wrote this insult - unless he had a lobotomy in between. This is Showgirls style, career destroying stuff I'm talking about here. The movie contains every hackneyed sci-fi action clich\u00e9 (in both imagery and dialog) and does them badly. The script is simply terrible. It makes no sense, and they try to force it to make sense with huge laughable swaths of exposition. Said exposition doesn't help to make the dialog any less stale. The action's been there and done that, the acting is arch and hammy, and the animation is amateur. This really must have been part of some kind of corporate tax write-off scheme, because everybody phoned it in. Maybe Kurt let his assistant do it.

Then I decided to humor myself, and proceeded to watch it on YouTube.Turns out it wasn't my gnat-sized thirteen year old attention span that prevented me from understanding this drivel. The film dives straight into the action the second the opening credits end; it was almost like the film makers were so eager to show you all the \"prettyful\", wonderfully repetitive action sequences they shoehorned in that they were nearly soiling their pants in excitement. In fact, they were so excited, they forgot to put in a plot to keep you interested. The film goes so fast it hardly stops to take a breath and explain things properly, like back stories and crucial things like that. The acting in this movie (including Milla, I'm sorry to say; I was very fond of her in The Fifth Element) was less than mediocre; it's in a league of its own, and everyone talks so fast that you're constantly reminded of those Speedracer parodies on CN. I concur with the commenter who said this was like a poorly translated Japanese flick; the dialog was so absurd and monotonous it made me want to die laughing in between mouthfuls of Cheez-Its. Or maybe just die.There's a lot to say about the \"special\" effects, but everyone else has pretty much got that covered. They were amazingly horrendous: they make the movie look like a bad XBOX game with Milla Jovovich copy-pasted on a fancy motorcycle. I had Final Fantasy flashbacks when she went all gravity defiant on the side of an office building, blew up a badly-animated helicopter and emerged completely unscathed from the wreckage. Oh, the wonders of blue screen animation. Makes me want to gnaw on a tire iron whenever I think of it.Anyway, there's no character development and our pretty, clich\u00e9d, unrealistic little heroine Violet the Mary Sue constantly contradicts herself. This bugged me: there's one point in the beginning where she blatantly tells a fast-talking enemy that she \"hates humans with every fiber of her being\" and will kill them quickly. Then not ten minutes later she proceeds to argue with her wannabe-vampire higher-ups that \"the humans don't have to die with her\" when they order her to do us all a favor and blow the place to bits.The film is a migraine waiting to happen for those of you who haven't seen it; the vibrant neon colors mixed with the nonstop, over the top action and fast paced story will more than likely give you motion sickness, and you'll definitely want to puke whenever a character speaks.Just...watch something decent. Like Barney. This is exactly the kind of rubbish that forced me to stop watching anime movies.",

            "review_title": "Worst action movie since Catwoman",
            "content": "Ultraviolet is, without a shadow of a doubt, the worst action movie to come out since Catwoman.The story is this: In the future, man develops a virus to create supersoldiers. The infected are called hemophages and they share many attributes with vampires. The government decides they are too dangerous, they all need to be exterminated, blah blah blah, Violet (Jovovich) decides to fight back and kill everybody.The basic concept is no better or worst than most other action movies with a tough-as-nails female protagonist. In isn't a masterpiece of storytelling, but it isn't suppose to be. The problem with this particular plot, however, is the way it is told. Director Kurt Wimmer makes sure to explain every plot point as soon as they are brought up, leaving absolutely no mystery and nothing to the imagination except how he got his script approved. The actual story is told at an incredibly rapid pace, and you will feel like you are rushing from one major revelation to the next, faster and faster, without caring about any of them. To top it all off, Wimmer constantly and randomly brings in external, unnecessary elements, such as a hinted-at romance between Violet and a scientist friend of hers. Many directors can pull off a bad plot by at least presenting it in a clever or interesting fashion, but Wimmer completely fails in Ultraviolet. Music videos have more plot development than this movie.Not that the quality of the script matters (although it should be noted that it is one of the cheesiest, most poorly written scripts I have ever had the pain of listening to), because the \"actors\" in this film are a joke. The main villain is a laughing stock: he has a metal gas filter shoved up his nostrils. The supporting cast is lame and forgettable. And Jovovich, the star, is just awful. The only way she could have pulled this film off is if she never talked and just used icy glares to communicate. When she is forced to show emotion for a kid in a certain scene, I wanted to burst out laughing. I couldn't tell if I hated the scene because it was pointless, had an awful script, or the acting was just so damn awful. Probably all of the above. Screw you, Kurt Wimmer.Wimmer tried to present a futuristic world immersed in awesome special effects, a sort of bastard child of Sin City's graphic novel approach and Minority Report's awesome technology. It failed. Most of the special effects and the action scenes are so obviously green screened that it is like watching an FMV for a video game. A crappy FMV. The characters all have digitally smoothed skin, making them look like models in Maxim. The intent was to give the film a \"comic book\" feel, but instead it just ended up looking like crap.I award Ultraviolet two points, and two points only. First, there is one particular scene where Violet kills a bunch of Yakuza (whose presence in the film is completely unnecessary and never explained) by carefully dodging and having the poor guys shoot each other. It was cool, and the only scene worth watching. That, and the addition of Gun Kata (although poorly utilized) earn this film one point.The second point is from two particular concepts. The first is that Violet has chameleon-like powers and can change her hair color, eye color, and costume color at will. It's a shame this is BARELY used at all, because it was cool, and she was damn hot with purple hair. Second, our heroine \"downloads\" her weapons into her hands, as if a hologram were taking physical form. It is a cool effect and a really cool concept for an action film.But that is it. Despite how hot Jovovich can be, she fails in every other way. The trailer for the movie promises action and cool special effects, and fails in both of those as well. Pretty much everything about this movie is horrible. I think Kurt Wimmer needs to take a long, long break before making any more films. He can think up some cool ideas, but he sure as hell can't execute them.I give Ultraviolet 2 out of 10, and just barely that.",

I would easily have given this film a higher mark, if the storyline had been less predictable.",

Aeon Flux was a soulless and worthless film with little action and a convoluted plot. Ultraviolet is sleek and stylish. Every action sequence is divine (Kurt Wimmer knows how to make an action scene sing). I can't recommend this flick enough.The only thing restricting it to 9 out of 10 stars is that the film obviously received no support from its studio. The CGI is miserable (I'm sure Kurt thought he was going to be given more of a CGI budget), and that tacked on 5 minute exposition at the beginning was not only pointless, but also detracted from the nonstop kinetic feel that is the heart and soul of the movie.But this is a must see for any real action fan! It is breathtaking!",

There are a few leaps that you have to make, and a few things you have to infer, but if you miss it, it won't ruin the flow of the film.

            "content": "It's hard to tell which movie is the fluke - \"Equilibrium\" or \"Ultraviolet\"? The \"plot\" of the film - which is told to us multiple times from multiple characters, including the introductory narration by title character Violet - takes place in the far (?) future where the world is ruled over by a fascist medical establishment that is trying to protect humanity from \"The Hemophagic Virus\". This is a virus that was created for warfare purposes and has turned it's victims into, basically, Vampires. The Vampires are now dying out, and Violet (Milla Jovovich) is trying to take out the establishment. For what purposes... I don't know. It's never revealed. As are so many other plot points that are touched upon and never revisited.The plot, though, is basically the same as almost any other sci-fi movie you've ever seen. Lone Badass rebels against The Establishment for murky personal reasons, realizes that they are in fact in it for The Greater Good, defeats The Establishment. Nothing new. The real weaknesses of \"Ultraviolet\" lie at the feet of pretty much ever other aspect of the movie. For a sci-fi film, the CGI and special effects work are cheap and look to be the quality of a first generation PlayStation 1 game cut-scene. Some scenes look as if they were shot in Kurt Wimmer's basement chroma-closet. This actually would be a decent explanation as to why there are so many tight-shots of Milla Jovovich's eyes and face. Yes, she is a very beautiful woman - possibly one of the most attractive \"actresses\" working - but during a car chase scene, I want to see a car chase, not her face looking straight at the camera, with blurry cars behind her flowing multi-colored hair.The direction and cinematography is awful in almost every aspect. The afore-mention no-budget CGI work makes everything shaky and incomplete. Half the film is shot with a soft-light filter that gives it a Barbara Walter's Interview-like feel. It also makes half the film blurry, lo-res, and - in printing terms - feel like it was poorly offset. The lip-syncing is off throughout the entire film. The editing is... atrocious. Scenes jump randomly. It's all linear, but poorly timed. But, since the all the \"sets\" look roughly the same, when Violet magically pops from one random building doing her random incomprehensible task to another random building doing yet a different random and incomprehensible task, the confusion is somewhat padded.Then there's the acting. The only person doing any acting is William Fichter from TV's \"Invasion\". And he's in the film for about 5 minutes of screen time. Milla, God bless her sexy ass, is an awful actress, as are the entire supporting cast, who are, from what I can tell, complete unknowns. Every \"actor\" is stiff and wooden, possibly reading from cue-cards. The script, if there was one, and dialogue is full of heavy-handed sci-fi mumbo jumbo jargon, which completely turns me off on any sci-fi entertainment I've watched.There are many other little things that bothered me. The long tubular hallway painted in the colors and pattern of the radiation symbol, and many other op-art architecture. The first establishing shot of The Establishment's headquarters shows the building firmly placed in the center of the city, and it's shaped like a giant Bio-Hazard symbol. Later, the same headquarters is shown to be out in the country somewhere, surrounded by a field of poorly stacked boxes. Then, this exact same establishing shot is shown in the exact same manner at least three other times. We see Violet use some sort of gravitational device early in the film, and this device apparently contains some sort of baby Sun that empowers it. We then see how this device works with a poorly animated tracking shot. Moments later, Violet uses the device again, and once more, we see the exact same tracking shot.Apparently, we, the viewers, are idiots.Well, at least I am for seeing this film.The biggest crime of the film, comes from more of a geek standpoint. For a movie about Badass Kung-Fu Vampires with Swords and Guns, tons of action scenes and fights, there's no blood. A movie - entirely based on the premise of blood and blood-borne pathogens - and there's maybe two drops shown. When two or more characters get into a sword-fight and get stabbed, especially when wearing all white clothes, there should be some blood. There are at least two action sequences that take place in pitch black darkness, the final one culminating in a sword-fight with Flaming Swords. Yes. And, for all the Vampires, including Violet's gang of French Hippie Vampires, not a single one does a g**d**** Vampire-like thing throughout the entire movie. They have fangs, that's it. They don't use them, they don't drink blood, they can walk around in daylight, etc.There is, fortunately, no UltraViolet comic book. And hopefully, no sequel. Avoid this movie, at all costs.",

The relationship that develops between Violet and Six is full of all kinds of twist and turns that succeeds in tugging at the heartstrings, in spite of all its incredible violence.Ultraviolet may not be the top grossing film of 2006, but it is worthwhile if your looking for a little bit of heart and fun in the comic book world of Asian martial arts and computer sci-fi games.",

I'm reminded of a South Park episode where a character tells Cartman \"good luck, good luck\" in a wholly contrived fashion. Dialog wise, that is this movie. Violet has a total phrase-vocabulary of about five things like \"watch me\" and \"you're all going to die,\" which seem better suited to one of those dolls with the strings in the back...The characters don't make you feel anything whatsoever (even in scenes where you're \"supposed to\"). This is a function of the plot mainly - UV is a \"sequel\" to another movie that was never made. You can't come to give a damn about the characters' pasts because it's all brought up in recollection and told \"matter of fact.\" If you see it you'll understand the \"sequel\" plot concept better. Take, for example, Matrix 2, LOTR: TT or Underworld Evolution. These sequels on their own lacked sufficient plot development without the originals. However, they actually developed the story better than UV does, yet UV has no \"original\" which it can set the stage for an all-action-no-story cinematic experience.Some of the fight sequences are decent to watch, but I agree with the other commenter that they're extremely predictable. Even if you accept the premise of anti-gravity and \"space collapsing weaponry,\" it's basically the same fight scene from beginning to end. If you watched the trailer, just extrapolate and imagine that for 90 minutes.I didn't mind the futuristic/animesque CG, but it was overboard. Everything in this movie is CG. Don't get me wrong - some movies can do CG heavy the right way: case in point Sin City. But this doesn't have the refined look Sin City did. Textures don't look right. Special effects are subpar and/or clich\u00e9 (if you want to see glass breaking, go watch the original Matrix).Overall, I'm out my 8 bucks on this one.

I only bring it up as that is the level of dialog that will drive me from the theater. I went into this with the highest of hopes The one really good thing I can say about this film was the trailer was cut with an attention to detail that had me salivating to see Mila jump around and generally kick the living bejusus out of everyone who offended her cute lil butt. I figured that I could tell from the trailer that it was going to be visually stunning if nothing else so if there was a bit of a plot drag I could over come this by attempting to imagine a private audience with the films star. Walk into the movie and pour a half pint of gin into my sprite. I do this because it helps me suspend the \"OH-you-have-got-to-be-kidding-me!\" reflex that most movies illicit. And sit through the ubiquitous 25 min of trailer. I enjoy trailer, this one has Linkletters A Scanner Darkly. A cell shaded movie in the vein Wakening Life. And it looks fantastic. I have a dark place in my heart I usually don't talk about reserved for Rory Cochrane ever since love and a .45. Anyway I sit back and take a long sip as the trailers end, And the five min of THX commercial begin, is it me or are those people getting entirely to full of themselves considering they haven't developed the tech to use vibrating lasers to interface with the part of my brain responsible for interpreting sounds? I'm just saying they could be doing better if I have to watch 5 min of there stupid little animated sound checks... this one had 3.And with that behind us the movie Begins. I was instantly irritated by the well trod road of the comic book cover intro. I was really hard on the art till I realized that this is a comic book movie. these are probably the actual covers from the books. Oh well I guess they couldn't hire out to get some really amazing art or it would illicit the wrath of the fan boy population and lets face it their your best allies in a film like this. Let me also say here. I Like Kurt Warner. I think I was pitching Equilibrium to people for years after it came out. Course I kinda have a big boy crush on Christian Bale, but still Kurt does good work in my opinion. The credits stop there roll through the world of comic books covers and we are instantly dropped in to a 10 min voice over in 3 parts. If you want your movie to be coy, to let you put together what's going on all by yourself, forgetaboutit. Mila and the main Antagonist Voice over the whole plot up to this point in a heavy handed synopsis of events. Not even attempting to allow for the movie to grow in any meaningful direction in a greater since but in only the specific linear plot of the immediate events. The political system the social precursors, even the economics of this world are laid out in attempt to put the viewed on a stable ground to enjoy the movie. Unfortunately it just comes off as hackish and dumbed down for the lowest common denominator of viewer. And it is here I know I'm in big trouble.As soon as the Facts are done being laid out in mind numbing detail, the first fighting seen is unveiled. For the first few seconds I am enthralled.. it is in a word... cool. For about 15 seconds when the Acton comes to a brutal halt. What....? Its just over.. oh well I think... I have two hours to wallow in the action, so ill just wait a few more seconds... nothing.... for another 10 min there is just simple plot, Mila breaking in somewhere kinda cool , the scenery is interesting I guess but I cant pay attention to it because I'm trying to decide if her wonderfulness Mila has some kind of skin condition that had made them air brush her face to the point of blurring all the lines that make her so beautiful. I literally could not believe the level of post production done to alter her face.... She is Gorgeous in all her other movies because she is just her. I mean I'm sure she is very made up but in this movie the blurry quality to her in particular made it almost imposable to enjoy.The movie progresses like this for another hour. Lots of fighting.. The fighting is UN-inspired and many times is just a joke. The fully rendered CGI environments are really obvious. The chase seen on the bike try's to be interesting by employing a constantly shifting gravitational environment, but dose not raise my heart rate at all. In the end I just walk. I wasn't having a good time, and the relationship between the boy and Mila lacks and chemistry at all. I walked just b4 the final showdown because I just did not care. In the end this rather halting attempt to create an engaging future reality fails on almost every level. I was nether sucked in by the environment or captivated by the plot/chemistry/fighting. The premise was a used 15th time around the block vehicle that as in all cases has every tool to shine but in the end was nothing more than a novel way to separate me from 8.50$.

I was sincerely looking forward to some kind of hot steamy sex scene to help balance out the other issues it was purported to suffer from, but alas I came back with the same reaction as those who commented previously.To the person who rated the movie highly because of the picture and sound: I do see your point about the pretty (albeit blurry) picture, and fashion style type of gadgets. However I also have to concur with the commenter who brought up the point about latex gloves and dust masks for infectious disease, vs. technology to store infinite amount of weapons inside a person. It just doesn't make sense.Even those comments aside, the real problem here is lack of storyline and character development.If you have a character facing hundreds of soldiers, then dozens of elite guards/assassins, if the character always emerges completely unscathed every time, you start to lose interest.If you have a character facing her own people who are just as fast/powerful/well-armed, you'd not expect the character to magically kill them all in seconds, same as all the guards.If you have an all powerful character who kills everything in her path suddenly have an affection for a young boy, or stare down from a balcony at some happy family wistfully, you need some reasonable character development to back it up.This is the heart of what is wrong with this film... Insufficient character development on either the hero or villain, combined with the feeling that the character is not only invincible but invulnerable as well. When you don't care about the outcome of the film, the odds of wanting to stick around to see the pretty pictures is very slim.The inane and simpleton dialog just makes sticking around that much worse.",

Many shots of Violet's butt, and many action scenes. I suppose that if I were forced to watch this film again, I would probably search for more things to laugh at. The first 10 minutes are excruciatingly pointless with long fight scenes for no reason almost. The fight scenes included EXTREMELY overdone choreography and were far too much to take seriously. Overall, this film was ridiculously overdone and generally lacking a plot. If you're looking for a movie to just sit and make fun of, this would be perfect. There are many opportunities for this and you'll probably get quite a few laughs out of it. I wouldn't recommend this movie for much other than that though.",

Few scenes actually have any blood or guts it just has Milla leaving the area behind with bodies strewn along the ground haphazardly in some bad remake of the Jonestown kool-aid incident.The movie is a bad example of too much cg (computer graphics) and too little story. Again Hollywood, in an attempt to make a quick buck displays too little integrity for the sci fi genre with obvious if not blatant rip off stunts. The movie basically is a little too unbelievable and needs to pull back some to bring the audience back in. I am a strong advocate in the suspense of dis-belief but this movie stretches it way too thin. Milla is the only upside to this movie and if not for her energy within the poorly written role I would have left the theatre in the first half hour. She is gorgeous as always but it is not the only reason why I saw this film. This movie is far from her fault and hopefully will not sink her budding career.",

            "content": "In the future, society is governed by mysophobic doctors, who ironically enough have created their own worst enemy. Discovering a virus that was relatively unknown, but had still been around for a long time, they tried to modify it to create faster, stronger soldiers. They only succeed in making it more contagious, and accidentally release it into the population. People become infected, transform into crazy powerful warriors, and are then forever dubbed as Hemophages. Both the government and the general citizens fear this new race in their midst and began to hunt them down and exterminate them in a manner reminiscent of the Holocaust.Now only a handful of Hemophages exist and are trying to desperately cling on to what little life they have, enter Violet (Milla Jovovich). Violet is a highly trained agent of the Hemophages who is sent to retrieve a weapon that can supposedly wipe all of them out, catch is the weapon is a small boy, and another catch is that Violet lost her child when she got sick, so now she wants to play mamma and protect the child, Six (Cameron Bright).So, here is where things begin to get complicated. Violet betrays her kind to save Six, who turns out to be a clone of Daxus (Nick Chinlund), the leader of the government, and is the sixth clone, hence the silly name. And through a confusing series of twists, in which Six is an ultimate weapon, then he is not, oh but then he is again! No wait\u0085his blood can save us! And lo! Apparently Hemophagia (the virus that makes Hemophages) is actually the virus that makes vampires! So that means that Hemophage is really a goofy technical term made to function as a thinly veiled reference to vampirism; which explains the humongous canines they are all sporting.So the story is a little wacky, and downright lacking. The unfortunate thing is the directing and acting does nothing to save it. Kurt Wimmer, the director who made the cult hit Equilibrium, seems to be trying so hard for about half the movie to make something good, then just throws his hands up and says \"Screw it! I'm done!\" At various points it seemed they knew they were going to be losing the audience, so they just threw up a gratuitous shot of Milla's rear, and this happens a lot, there are more butt shots than fight scenes. The dialogue, which already wasn't one of the movies strongest points, gets worse; the audience gets treated to such gems as: \"Are you mental?!\" Daxus says when Violet apparently approaches seven-hundred soldiers, the Hemophage/Vampire scientist Garth's great line \"Why do you keep shutting me out? You need to learn to let people in!\" and hands down, the greatest line to ever kick off the climatic battle at the end of a movie, \"It is on!\" Wimmer's direction is all over the place, like a kid with ADD who just cocktailed caffeine and sugar, then shot it directly into his veins. He doesn't seem to be able to focus on any particular story element to push, and instead throws out a hodgepodge of themes that are only mildly touched upon. His vision for this movie seemed so grand, but he couldn't exactly decide what he wanted it to be. The unfortunate thing was that his movie prior to this was amazing, which means that either that was a fluke, or something went horribly wrong. The movies original runtime was supposed to be 120 min, and the studios cut it down to 88 min, much to the chagrin of the director. This might explain some of the problems with the film, but I am having trouble seeing how the extra 32 minutes will raise the film above mediocre at best.Considering the low budget of the movie, stylistically the movie is stunning. It aims for a highly stylized, comic book feel, like a colored Sin City. However, for such a CG (computer graphic) heavy movie, they should have gotten a bigger budget. At no point did anything that was CG generated look realistic, most of it looked like something from the mid-nineties era of video games. And the CG only got worse as the movie went on, the movie ends with the worst fake fire I have since the 80's.The movies strongest point, other than Milla Jovovich's looks, is the fight scenes. The Gun Kata that Wimmer developed for Equilibrium makes it return in Ultraviolet, now shown with the fluidity that Wimmer intended. The fights themselves look amazing, but are crazily unrealistic. For as much fun as it is to see someone dodge bullets, thus causing her enemies to effectively shoot themselves, by about the third time everyone circles around Violet to fight, you ask yourself, \"Is everyone in this world really that stupid?\" The PG-13 rating also creates an interesting dilemma in that the fights are bloodless, it seems like she is just clubbing everyone to death, and no visible wounds appear on anyone, at anytime.With its futuristic setting the movie has lots of gadgets, space compression technology that allows its user to store a huge cache of weapons in a bracelet, only to have them materialize in the hands. This also allows for blades to pop out of guns, devices that allow a person to reverse gravity around themselves (which I still want to know how that's possible). And what I personally think is interesting, but merited an explanation for which it got none, is the clothing and hair that functioned like a mood ring and constantly changed colors.I'm a masochist when it comes to movies, so to say I didn't enjoy this movie would be a dirty lie. That doesn't mean I think it was a good movie. This movie is only slightly better than Uwe Boll's films; it's a train wreck, just not a catastrophic one.",

The story line jumps about from topic to topic without any link or feeling from the characters. The fight sequence is brilliant, unfortunately it is repeated again and again. violet is always surrounded and always wins, by the end you feel like you could do fight for her as you've seen all the moves over and over. I was disappointed with Milla Jovovich as well, i believe she is an amazing actress but in this movie you get the feeling that not even she gets the plot. The motorbike chase is really good until they go OTT with the cgi and you feel like your watching a playstation game. I think the overall problem is that there are too many themes thrown in without a link being created for them, for instance vampires, genetics, a funny gravity thing which has no explanation. I'm sure all these themes would be valuable and meaningful additions to the story if they had been explained and given depth. You can also tell that this female lead movie was directed by a man as he has made his lead character over emotional, sorry to pull the gender card but if this film were male lead the character would be level headed and in control. Another disappointment was the villain, not only is he about as intimidating as my fluffy pink slippers, he also has the worst lines ever. If your looking for a female lead action movie go with Resident evil one or two. Or if your no good with zombies go with Underworld. Only die hard fans of female lead roles, or avid Kurt Wimmer fans should check this out.",

I went to see this movie for two reasons. 1st: I thought the main character was acted by Parker Posey Nope - it was Milla Jovovich. 2nd: I thought it would be nice relaxation (aka \"Lay your brain aside in the dressing room\") sci-fi movie. Well, not everything was bad in this movie: * Nice body of Milla Jovovich (though Parker Posey might have been more interesting in that role) * Visual side of the movie Everything else: crap I can't tell how many times I said to myself: \"Oh my god! They can't be serious.\" And I'm not that much picky.Just few examples: * Sword fight with Nerva's comrades: One shot: cut-off heads and limbs flowing in the air, falling on the ground. Following shot: all fighters laying on the ground in whole. No parts of bodies on the ground, no blood. * Daxus' cross-shaped \"lair\" is placed amidst random-height haystacks (oh so lame CG) * The story is soooooo lame. Really hardly believable. * Garth's truck: OK, let's suppose everything in it is untraceable. What would you do if you traced something/someone. Than lost the signal and the only thing present in a place of last contact would be an odd anachronistic trailer? Of course you would not search inside the truck thus making it perfect haven :-). * Probably reminiscence of Resident Evil: If you see yourself in a corridor and see Milla Jovovich, consider yourself dead ;-)In a nutshell: Before seeing this movie be warned: that 88 minutes of your life you're never getting back.",

            "content": "OK. I decided to rent this movie because my brother said it was one of the worst movies he'd ever seen. He related the \"are you mental?\" scene to me and I knew immediately that I had to see it. That little nugget is just one of many many wonderful, nay... Brilliant lines this masterpiece is chock full of. Some of my favorites include, \"Because these moments... as beautiful as they are... are evil when they're gone.\" and \"Its on!\" followed by the heroine's blistering retort, \"Yeah it is!\" Other lines I'll decline to mention because you just have to see them to believe them. Typing them does no justice to the breathtakingly awkward glory of their deliveries. Ah! there is just so much to talk about.OK First how about the good stuff which is actually bad stuff, but not like bad-good, like good-good, but bad because it could have been more good. So, The Train Scene, I loved the train scene. It was only like a minute long but it was so good kind of. I wish the director would have lingered on that angle looking down the car with Violet on the left, head hung low, rubbing her forehead with one hand, pistol at ready in the other and Six on the right just staring at her for at least, at least, another five seconds. it was a great, simple, understated shot. Oh well.Next up: The Fireworks Scene, this scene was supposed to be the \"bonding\" scene I think, but its hilariously forced and rushed. But! But, the light on their faces and the dream she describes and then the thing with her hands... See I didn't understand she was talking about the tattoos on her fingers the first time I saw it. I blissfully thought she was just relating intimate details about her life in this weird childish way that was somehow very visceral, metaphoric even... especially how both her finger and her voice kind of lingered on lover. Milla has an incredible voice sometimes. But somehow the fact that she was just showing off her tattoos kind of cheapened it for me. Good stuff though.Let's see.. what else? Oh yeah! The Playground scene. Immediately after the infamous \"are you mental?\" debacle Violet and Six are somehow all of the sudden in a park having fun? A place Violet said just back there in the Fireworks scene that doesn't exist? The first time watching I thought it was like a dream sequence or something, then I thought maybe the spinning merry-go-round disc thing was like a metaphor for life and they were both on the edge about to fall off cause they were dying. Of course somehow its all actually happening but where and when are totally brushed aside. I would have so liked some more blatant symbolism there. And I know if there was any it was unintentional because this movie has a serious penchant for exposition. On the other hand... maybe thats just a front and there actually IS really deep stuff going on here! I better watch it again right away, OK after I finish this comment.Now for the bad-bad, you know like bad-good? but really bad. First, the first scene. Where did they find these guys investigating the ninjas? Fortunately this scene immediately sets the tone for the movie with some of the worst delivered, most hilarious dialog. Near the end there are some real Gems. The award for most inappropriate acting goes to Milla of course in the scene right after she rescues Six from the well, she takes him to some building and all of the sudden she is all shaky and sweaty and totally in his face. There is this very unflattering close-up from behind six's head and it looks like she's about to make out with him or something she's so worked up.Just after the Playground scene Garth, great future-name by the way. Hey Garth! The not future called and they don't want you not to give your name back to them and stuff! Good one, right guys? Anyway, when he brings Violet back with the magic of surgery and some other convenient thing and she's all looking foxy and upset and she's like \"Why did you bring me back Garth, oh Garth, why!?\" he's all like \"isn't it obvious\" then boom, they are on a roof suddenly and Garth mumbles something about her not letting anyone in and then Violet says some hilarious crazy Emo crap but seriously it was the worse scene progression ever. Then shes in some apartment still being all Emo and has this totally weird flashback or something, who knows maybe it really happened? but it was about a tear falling on her dead husband and his new family from a balcony, apparently it was significant because she got all pumped after that.So in conclusion This movie Rules! I highly recommend it, You won't be let down if you know what to expect. Expect to laugh, cringe, and be confused!",

Well, think I'll be safe with this film, there's not much to spoil.Ultraviolet stars Milla Jovovich as a futuristic vampire called Violet Song Jat Shariff. Milla seems to have become something of a sci-fi babe with films such as The Fifth Element and Resident Evil. The story goes, mmm, maybe story is too strong a word for it. The thin line of plot that runs through the film is that Violet has found a cure for vampires, but the humans want to use it to kill the vampires, or something. Oh look, I'll be honest, I'd fallen asleep by this point, if it wasn't for some kids throwing popcorn at my head and waking me up I'd have missed the best bit of the film, the end credits! I'm not selling this film very well here am I? Well, Milla Jovovich is a very nice looking lady, and she wears very tight outfits during the whole of the film, so it does have some good points. The sets are very, well, colourful, if you need advice on how not to paint the bathroom then this film is for you. The action sequences are quite nice. No, I'm really struggling to think of anything good to say.Look, lets be honest, if your a bit of a sci-fi geek/nerd your going to go see the film no matter what (if they haven't already pulled it from the cinema and destroyed all existing copies of it, which, to be honest, they should), if your not a sci-fi fan, then stay away from this film, well away, very very far away.I've given the film a rating of two out of ten, that's one point for each of Milla's leather clad butt cheeks.

The acting was not an issue (though Jovovich did well in her striking monologues), but as far as story line... it has holes.In my opinion, unless you work at a theater or have an extra ten dollars, this movie can be handled much better in your own home.",

I am dumber for having seen this \"film\" and firmly believe that it's general \"dumbening\" effect is all that can account for the few positive comments attached to it.I further feel that it is absolutely imperative that we begin a campaign as soon as possible to prohibit this bit of cinematographic excrement from ever being broadcast on network television, lest the signal eventually find it's way to another intelligent species elsewhere in the universe. While it is possible that Wimmer will simply be tried for crimes against humanity and prevented from doing any further harm here on Earth, there is no punishment severe enough that could be leveled against the human race that would be equivalent to our releasing this horror to other unsuspecting peoples.Hyperbole aside, there really is nothing good to say about this movie. I'd discuss the plot, but \"woman kills people because she's mad about... things\" sums it up nicely.\"But wait!,\" you say, \"Surely there's enough eye candy to save it!\" Are you accustomed to candy that violates your eye sockets with salted cacti? I'm not. I'm not sure, but I think it very likely that the original CGI test animatics were used rather than taking the time to render things properly. \"Comic-book feel\" you say? I've come across few comic books drawn by an epileptic, colorblind baboon.The dialog is a step below atrocious. I find myself consulting a thesaurus in a vain attempt to find language that better quantifies my disappointment. It could have been delivered more effectively by a mime... and at least the miming would have filled up some of the 85 minutes with more interesting material.Ultraviolet has already robbed me of enough of my life, so I'll offer only one final warning that I would have appreciated before I headed to the theater this afternoon: Ultraviolet isn't entertaining in any way. It's so bad that it can't even be enjoyed with friends who enjoy bad movies. It may, however, be worth going out of your way to sneak into the theater without paying, but only for the satisfaction of walking out within the first 5 minutes. Even then, I'd recommend earplugs.",

In a lot of ways this movie is what Aeon Flux should've been, especially in character personality. Milla came off far tougher than Charlize Theron did. The plot in the movie was semi-average. Nothing special, nothing bad. The vampire side of it was never explored very far, but it wasn't the main thing the movie was about either, it was the excuse for her super-skills, sorta the way Blade was, except Milla never bites anyone. The only thing that bothered me in the movie was one the line Milla uses in the beginning and later \"My name is Violet and I live in a world you may not understand\", they really had no reason to have it in the movie at all. It was kinda annoying when it was used. The ending had a problem of similar sorts, they shoulda ended it without any voice over dialog and it woulda been a great ending. So that's the only two things I have of critique, if it wasn't for that I woulda given it a near perfect score. I recommend the movie to anyone who really like action/futuristic movies.

I don't expect the movie to be as gripping as Shawshank Redemption. Instead, it should be compared to other movies in the same genre such as any movie based on a game (e.g. Resident Evil, Doom, Blood Rayne, etc.). Aeon Flux comes to mind since it also stars a female action hero fighting against a totalitarian government set in a dystopian future where people frequently disappear without a trace. I might add that Aeon Flux carried off the theme to much better effect. Granted, it had a larger budget, but the main character was more likable and the plot was consistent.The dialog was rather stilted and characters were paper-thin. They should have taken a cue from Keanu Reeves in the Matrix and had the main character say very little. Milla is easy on the eyes. She's a model, not an actor.Lack of plot and character development aside, the fight scenes were fun, but were repetitive and boring towards the end. There was a little too much spinning and twirling to get away from guns and swords while the bad guys impaled and shot each other. That approach was over-used and exceedingly tiresome by the end of the movie.I found the use of color and flashy sets as the most compelling facet of the film. They made for good backdrops for the fight scenes. This style isn't for everyone, but if you like vibrant colors and have a whacky fashion sense, then you might appreciate the scenery.I'll give it a 3.0 largely for the set design, but it loses points for a poorly thought-out plot, poor acting, and a half-baked script. The fight scenes were enjoyable at first but unbearably repetitive by the end.",

Now I have found an exception to the rule - watching someone cheat while playing a video game. Because that's what the makers of Ultraviolet do: cheat. The live actors appear as computer generated as the backgrounds. Considering the lack of humor and emotion displayed by the performers, one might assume that their only participation was to allow their three-dimensional images to be programmed into a computer and reproduced.

Admittedly, the previews turned me into a guppy and for some reason I saw potential in this film. Ultimately, it lacks in so many areas and doesn't do much making up for it in other areas. The CGI was not up-to-par with most modern films, there were long sections of bad dialogue (with only a few one-liners that made me giggle), some really bad acting (as in terribly unconvincing and lacking in emotion), bad casting, and fight sequences that were unoriginal and drawn-out. The best part was the musical score. The costumes were OK...but not as good as they looked in the previews.Now onto the *really* bad stuff. Um... plot, what plot? The film made a poor attempt at following any kind of mappable plot. Most of it was very predictable and seemed to me like a conjunction of many different plots squeezed into one. Thus, the continuity of the movie was flubbed. There were so many gaps in the plot that was there, that I completely lost track of the story-line a little less than halfway through the movie. All of the acting seemed to lack the type of conviction that was necessary and the characters were very wishy-washy. Many of the terms were inconsistent and/or didn't make complete sense. I think some of the scenes were supposed to serve as some type of catharsis, and these scenes failed miserably. It seemed very much like the director and/or producers couldn't decide what they wanted the chief genre of this movie to be. UltraViolet was almost sectioned off by types of scenes in which a singular emotion and film genre dominated, and then very rigidly shifted to another emotion and genre.There were many scenes that could have been cut to save screen-time so that more important details could have been added. Overall, the film was inconsistent and disjointed. If you want to see Milla Jovovich run about in pleather fighting bad guys for a reason that isn't very clear, go ahead and watch it.

My Fianc\u00e9 and I decided right away that we didn't want to see any such crap, but I regret that decision now. We saw a movie so awful that I'd actually pay money to NOT see it: UltraViolet.I've sometimes described movies as cotton candy, meaning that the movie was all about glitter and special effects with no real substance. Well, this was not cotton candy; this was LSD, and it was a bad trip.The movie starts out with Milla Jovovich (the hottie from Fifth Element) explaining an overly complex back story. There's something going on with a medical company and vampires; except that they're not really vampires. They're called Hemophages. They don't mind daylight. Some of them can see in the dark, but others can't. They have little fangs, and apparently don't drink blood, but if their blood gets on you, you become one... or something like that.The action scenes are kind of cool, but they only last for a few seconds and everyone moves in an oddly jerky motion like they're dancing to techno music. The visuals are way passed bizarre. They blended the CG with real video using an odd blur like the cut scenes in Project Gotham Racing. Jovovich makes her eyes and hair change color a lot, but for no reason whatsoever! Then there's this little boy. The heroine, Violet, feels bad for him because she had a forced abortion or maybe a miscarriage. I'm not too sure which one. It turns out the boy was a clone made by the bad guys in the medical corporation. At first it looks like he's a virus to wipe out Hemophagues (vampires), but he's not. Then it seems like he's the cure for vampirism, but he's not. He was some other type of virus designed to wipe out humans instead of vampires. It was apparently some kind of profit-making scheme that the company made up.So, Violet decides to protect the little clone boy. There's a bunch of short fights with humans and vampires. The whole damn thing is almost incomprehensible, and at the end of the movie I get the distinct feeling that I just wasted my money. If you're even thinking about going to see this movie, stop.",

More gun kata, and the aforementioned Jovovitch kicking butt. Pretty simple formula for a fun popcorn-munching flick.So, here's my review of UV. After much thought, and careful analysis of the motion picture in question, I feel qualified to offer the following in-depth review.What a piece of crap.That's it. That's the review.Okay... maybe a LITTLE more.Jovovich was hot. I think that was the one good thing.The few gun kata/fight scenes were kinda cool, but the rapid cuts and dream-like cinematography took much away from them. It was hard to TELL it was a similar style to the stuff from Equilibrium.Most of the movie seemed to be shot with overly strong lighting, through gauze with poor CGI backgrounds. They were shooting for a comic-book kinda feel (I think), but it just came off as looking cheap and overexposed. As if someone was trying HARD to give this a stylized cool look, but simply couldn't AFFORD to pull it off. (Based on the budget for this flick, that's probably true.) The visual style reminded me of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, although with less budget. Sin City this ain't.The plot. Yikes ... what a mess. (Slight spoilers ahead...) From the previews, the \"hemophages\" were fighting against the humans that had created them.In the actual movie, that was indeed the basic plot, but it was intermixed with Violet dying (for reasons that were never REALLY clear... I guess hemophages have short life-spans?) and a child who'd been created by the Evil Empire (TM) for nefarious purposes.Her mission? To steal a package, which actually (unbeknownst to her) contains the child. Of course, she'd LOST a child when she'd been made into a hemophage/vampire, (super-soldiers that are vampires? okay ...uh... why?) so this \"perfect warrior\", upon discovered the contents of the package, throws all her beliefs out the window and turns on her own crew to save the child...which is NOT hers. (Supposedly, the kid is infected with something that, when his blood is atomized and sent into the atmosphere, will destroy the hemophages.)Meanwhile, the hemophage \"leader\" looses most of his fellow vamps in a brief battle with the head of the Evil Empire(TM), who is awfully fast and accurate for a mere human. Hmmm. I wonder why THAT could be? Oh,one spoiler-free comment about the end of this film. Sure, flaming swords = cool. However, the method in which they shot this \"climax\" was terrible. I felt like I MISSED half of the final fight because it took place in a totally dark room. Stupid.Plus that CGI at the end, during the denouement after the fight... was simply the WORST of the bunch. They couldn't even do convincing glass breaking.Hell, I've been re-watching Babylon 5 recently, and the CGI sets & effects in the first season of B5 were more convincing than this dreck. That was shot more than 11 years ago, on a rather low television budget.How can you POSSIBLY do worse than that with modern tech? Low budget or not? It baffles me. Most television CGI these days is more convincing.I won't go through the whole \"plot\", as I'm still trying to excise it from my brain. Suffice to say it was held together by a thread, and a thin one at that. Jovovich's wardrobe and the few cool-ish action scenes couldn't save this mess.I could have dealt with a weak plot and such, as I was expecting a mindless action flick. But the cinematography was so distracting, and the fight scenes were so badly cut in an effort to be \"artistic\" that I just couldn't get past the AMOUNT of flaws.Anyway, it's the first time in ages that I've sat in a theater wondering quietly to myself \"is it over yet?\" Heck, after the movie, I couldn't help but overhear 4 teenage boys going on about how HORRIBLE and LOUSY the movie had been. One even stated it was the worst piece of &%*#$ he'd ever seen.When teenage boys are saying an \"action\" movie with a super-hot, PVC-clad, female lead sucks.. you KNOW something is really off.Avoid at all costs. Rent or buy Equilibrium instead.",

The amount of overdone and obvious CG coupled with the absurd plot holes and complete lack of sense in every technology and design made watching Ultraviolet painful. What there was of a plot was horrid and the entire movie was filmed behind a vaseline smeared lens and every actors face was airbrushed so badly that in many of Milla Jovovich's close up shots she didn't even have a nose. It was less of an artistic style and more a train wreck.The audience walked out of the theater without a word, avoiding eye contact as if ashamed, or maybe just embarrassed. Upon exiting the theater I saw a number people lined up to buy tickets and couldn't help myself; I yelled over the chatter, \"Ultraviolet sucked!

Then all of a sudden you think maybe I missed it, or I don't get it. Well that is not the case, there was nothing written in the scrip to \"get\". Aside from semi cool effects thrown around here and there, the great triumph of this film is the fact it only runs 94 minutes. I loved The Fifth Element.

            "content": "My comments are based on the extended version DVD, not the theatrical cut.I expected the movie to totally stink based on the reviews and comments here and elsewhere, but was surprised by the overall quality. Mille isn't a bad actress, and although some of her lines were a bit clich\u00e9 for the genre, she actually pulls it off with convincing style. It's hard to take a hot babe like her seriously, but she is convincing as an assassin and almost superhero. I really wouldn't want to make her mad, and her athleticism is convincing. Violet reminds me of the girl-next-store becomes CIA super-agent: simultaneously soft and real, but very p!ssed-off and deadly. Now, if only she would play Kleist's Penthiselea....It is obvious that UV had a minuscule budget and was filmed in China. The CG has poor detail and simply wasn't given enough money or time. Still, the compositing is actually pretty good, and the action and story are no worse than other films of this genre. The acting isn't as bad as the choir claims it is: from reading all the reviews here, I expected something worse than Plan 9 from Outer Space meets public access channel at 2am. Instead, UV is a decent story with great action and mostly good acting. Anyone who pans the movie is expecting formula blockbuster crap from Hollywood; this movie is indie sci-fi meets Shanghai. I actually liked the overall atmosphere and feel of the low-budget 3D scenes and felt transported into a different world as a result. Who said CG has to imitate reality? Robert Rodriguez got better reviews for SpyKids 3D which pales in comparison to UV. I know, different movie types for different audiences, but still....As for rip-offs of previous movies, there are a few effects which are borrowed, but that is common in the movie industry. Even the Matrix series borrowed heavily from lesser-known predecessors like Virtuosity. In fact, UV surprises in a few places with original (although minor) effects, and Mille pulls it off fairly well. I watched UV and Underworld II on the same weekend, and although Underworld II clearly had a much bigger budget, I found it less entertaining and satisfying. It's hard to connect with Kate Beckinsale, as delicious as she may be in tight leather (and in the gratuitous sex scene), but there's only so much Lycan-vampire-blood gore that one can stand. As for comparisons to Aeon Flux, Charlize is a very good actress, and AF is good in its own right (the story is actually pretty good), but I enjoyed UV more. And I'm 45 years old and happily married, and have a PhD.UV has a plot, a moral, and is entertaining. If you set aside your preconceptions of what the movie is supposed to be, and don't expect formulaic Lord-of-the-Rings or Star-Wars big-budget effects, you might actually enjoy it.",

The setting for this movie seems like your waiting in line for the Space Mountain ride at Disney World and when you wait the hour and forty minutes to get on the ride, the ride itself was boring and short. The ONLY interesting parts of this movie were the few action sequences where we actually see her fight. Other than that, just edit to gun than to sword back to face than to dead soldier. That is the formula for most of the fights in this movie. There was nothing original about this movie. If you want an interesting futuristic storyline with scantily clad women watch the Aeon Flux animated show, if you want basically the same action sequences but with actually seeing whats going on, watch Equilibrium, and if you want better dialogue , watch Kazaam, because at least Shaq talks in rhymes and that takes some talent.",

I also thought the visual effects were good. It reminded me of a video game. It also made the transition to computer special effects more seamless, in my opinion. Milla Jovovich looked amazing, but her acting was pretty much mediocre. I was disappointed that William Fitchner didn't have a bigger role.

It's as if they patched together scenes from three or four different scripts and filmed it. The set design is garish and annoying, the direction bland and uneven, and the characters are both wooden and confusing. The \"plot\" involves a genetically enhanced race of humans being hunted down by the government, until an assassin named Violet discovers some kind of \"ultimate weapon,\" which turns out to be a young boy. The \"hemophages\" are sometimes called vampires for no apparent reason, even though they don't drink blood and don't burn up in the sun, and only a few of them have fangs (Violet doesn't seem to have them). Violet randomely switches from being a totally ruthless assassin to being an emotional wreck from scene to scene, and the young boy named Six starts out seemingly autistic and then changes into a normal child who teaches Violet about being human again. The special effects are cheap and cartoony, and the set design is all round hallways and huge rooms with single color schemes. The acting is simply godawful from start to finish, even though most of the actors in the film aren't bad actors. But it's hard to bring life into a character with such stilted, idiotic dialogue and lack of any apparent motivation. This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

So needless to say I was excited to finally see this. However, I was thoroughly disappointed by it overall.The movie starts off extremely promising. Lots of action, and not just action...EXTREME action. Beautifully crafted fight and chase scenes. I recall thinking to myself as I'm watching it \"Man, this is the kind of movie I could watch over and over and never get tired of it.\" I was dead wrong. The movie painfully dies out after the first 15-20minutes or so. It fizzles out in a way where you think to yourself \"It's just a slow point in the movie, it'll get better!\" Dead wrong again. Ultraviolet goes into a downward spiral from which it can never recover.The dialogue is horrific, to the point I had to wince and grimace in pain. Cheesy lines strung together over and over. The movie may not be so bad if the dialogue was a little better, but it's just so bad.Now my review won't be limited to the bad points of the movie. I am compelled to highlight the good points of Ultraviolet so as to not completely shame it.The special effects in this movie are amazing, short and simple. It's all so bright and colorful, that you can't help but be in awe of it all. The contrast many contrasting colors in each scene add a depth you wouldn't believe. You can tell that the makers of the film put a lot of effort into making it pretty.And the action sequences, albeit short and few and far between were great. For anyone who saw Equilibrium you will not be disappointed with these. The full realization of \"Gun Kata\" is exquisite, though only given a scene or 2 to display it. Most of the fight scenes however use either swords or hand to hand combat, and if not that some random shooting. The Gun Kata only comes into play in short bursts, and they definitely could have added more.Overall, the movie left me with a sense of \"when is the next fight scene gonna be\" only to be disappointed as it continued into a never ending battle of words. I would have to say the movie is about 20% action and 80% bad dialogue and story. I was really expecting more from this and am utterly disappointed with it.

This movie was not made to rival \"The Matrix\", It was made to bring a comic book to life. The movie, being shot thru a blending-type filter, I would have thought, would be a great hint. Very few people anymore understand the style of American comics (before manga came out). They are action packed, stereotypical, and unrealistic. Some people (like me) can enjoy this type of entertainment. If you have an open mind to these ideas you will love this movie.I am also left with no choice but to comment on how spectacular the fighting and the chase scenes were. They were simply mind-blowing, and, in my opinion, sometimes surpassed The Matrix (The Matrix team worked on this movie). I will ABSOLUTELY buy this DVD the day it comes out.Whether others admit it or not, this movie takes some sophistication to appreciate. All you need is a good old comic book and a half hour and you will be ready for this movie. It is one of my favorites.",

            "content": "This movie was so incredibly horrid, I can hardly imagine the audience this would appeal to.This ranges from the dialog which is predictable and not in a good way. Because the characters are so extremely 1-Dimensional it is entirely possible to predict their very limited repertoire of words.The film mixes high-tech weaponry with common modern day firearms. There are hand-held machine-pistols of doom and utter destruction side by side with G36k or Beretta 92, which makes no sense at all.And, rating strongest in my problems with this film: The action sequences. After the first 5 minutes the viewer has realized, that:No amount of enemies will be able to stop Violet, seemingly endless numbers of faceless soldiers are thrown at her with NO EFFECT WHATSOEVER. I mean WTF, the other Vampires die just fine, even against moderate odds.The antagonists, who for the most part are meant to be highly trained soldiers, have NO CLUE on how to use firearms. They charge with their rifles held in front of them towards the obvious m\u00eal\u00e9e equipped Violet. They make no effort to use overlapping fields of fire. They don't hold their ground, they swarm brainlessly around and get killed. They don't even check their fire and continuously kill their own comrades. They shoot worse than the good ol' Stormtroopers, they manage to not hit Violet in totally enclosed spaces, in one way corridors and many more such situations..It really is infuriating to watch this when you have the slightest amount of gun-knowledge or even just seen a movie were this was properly displayed.",

Yes, there are moments when the futuristic nature of weapons appearing from no where seems a bit far fetched. However, the action was never ending. Mila Jovovich looked great in her spandex outfits and had moves that were awesome. The vampires were infected with the virus that was created to make a better working human; however, the experiment went awry and the virus escaped. If you had paid close attention to this movie you might have enjoyed it better. It was a very fast paced movie and close attention to dialog was important to follow the plot.

This movie was made strictly for the comic lovers and for me as a somewhat comic artist and reader I felt tat this film nabbed the essence of the comic quite well. The only problem with this film, as it has been with numerous films, was that there was too much special effects. The storyline was guessable and relatively easy to figure out the ending by about halfway through the movie but I wouldn't have given this movie 4 stars as said above. It would receive a 7. People today are to critical on movies. You can't judge this movie on the success of \"A Beautiful Mind\". Nor can you judge \"A Beautiful Mind\" on Ultraviolet.

The acting was almost non existent, the special effects were a combination of an eighties low budget film, and a bad LSD trip. I was surprised that this move made it to theaters.

            "content": "Writer and Directer Kurt Wimmer has produced a mirror image of Equilibrium. Unfortunately this is just a shallow and painful reflection of what Kurt Wimmer could have accomplished. This is yet another case of where style over substance falls flat on its face.The Good? CGI - Most people will disagree with me on this topic, but I actually thought the style of the CGI helped the movie. There's those movies that try to create uber-realistic graphics, but they fall well short of their goal and ruin the overall feeling of the movie. Well, let me be the first to say the CGI is very stylish and flows well with the action scenes. If you can handle cartoonish graphics added into some \"Gun Kata\", then it shouldn't be too bad.Score - I'm not going to lie, this movie had some pretty bad ass music in it. It went well with the movement of the film and made some of the more lackluster moments a bit less boring.Art Direction and set designs - Once again the style of this movie proves to come in very handy, but the horribly heavy substance just outweighs it all. A very colorful world filled with sharp and vivid images, enough for your retina to orgasm from the flavor put into each shot. While the sets weren't the most creative, they fit in with the film very well and add some creativity to an otherwise shallow movie.The Mediocre? Action - Okay, how many people went into this movie purely for the action? I admit I was one of those buffoons, because I was hoping Wimmer would build from Equilibrium's action and add more to it. In fact, the action made me feel ridiculously empty with how short it actually was. A lot of potential was untapped in this movie's fight scenes and I believe the PG-13 rating really affected the maturity of what could have been some classic chapters in sci-fi/action history. A lot of potential, failed delivery and too short to be satisfying.The Bad? Acting - Wow, oh boy do I miss Bale, Diggs, Bean and Macfadyen. Mila should never, ever have to spit out emotional lines in an action movie again. Every time an actor said something other than your clich\u00e9 one-liner, I wanted to choke on a pretzel. Nick Chunlund couldn't deliver a villainous line if Darth Vader's voice was dubbed over his. Sebastien Andrieu has a generic and stupid vampire accent, which just leads to ears bleeding, children crying and popcorn buckets breaking in half.Writing/Story - Can anyone here spew more than one sentence of garbage? I guess not because that's what every character does. The story is so pointless and convoluted that everyone that was involved with this movie should be forced to read a novel as punishment. Overall - The action is way too short and the drama is so poorly done, you'll ask yourself was Equilibrium just a fluke? The bad really does out weigh the good in this head case of a movie. An hour of forced and horrible dramatic acting with 35 minutes of short action scenes makes this movie a cesspool of false hope and wasted potential.My advice - Sneak in to see the first twenty minutes and then leave.

However, you can't seem to work up the courage to actually do it. Go see this movie. Assuming that, during the viewing, your brain hasn't exploded, Ultraviolet will surely have given you that extra nudge you needed to push you over the edge.3. You're extremely paranoid. You've read every god-awful review of Ultraviolet there is to be had, and you wonder. Why does everyone tell me not to see this movie? Maybe it's a actually a great movie! Maybe it's so good that anyone who's seen it wants to keep it to themselves. Sure. Tell yourself that.4. You are the sworn enemy of someone involved in this movie and you wish to laugh at their shame.5. This is the only real reason to watch this movie. Hypothetically, let's say you were dating Milla, the star of Ultraviolet. you've gone out for dinner once or twice, but you haven't really gotten past second with her. One day, she says, \"Hey, I'm in this really cool movie, want to watch?\" Now, remember, at this point you haven't gotten into her pants yet, so you say sure. Now, I hope you're really into this having sex with Milla thing, because if not, the next 88 minutes will not be worth it. An important reminder: If you've already slept with Milla, and she asks you to watch this movie with her, say no. If you say yes, she'll develop unrealistic expectations of your commitment to her. She'll think you really love her, and she'll trick you into marrying her. Then she'll quit her job, leaving you to support her. Finally, she'll let herself go and get fat. So don't watch Ultraviolet.6. You hate kittens. It's a well known fact that every time someone watches Ultraviolet, God kills a kitten.",

This only magnified the movies faults even more. Some of the effects also looked cartoonish which in turn ruined the suspension of disbelief. The writer also chose to base some of the characters on an established supernatural being (vampires) , but strayed so far from the established mythology it leaves you wondering why he did so in the first place.

Milla Jovovich can do much, much better than this, and I can only assume that it was thrown together badly - maybe she did the best she could with the script handed her? Or am I giving Milla too much credit? It's eye candy and little more, especially with the visual effects and gravity-defying scenes. I guess I'm also stuck on her worthy performance in The Fifth Element. I found myself watching the clock and nearly stopped at 45 minutes, but then out of sheer curiosity waited it out to see if anything interesting came out it.

I enjoyed this film because it allowed my imagination to wander aggressively and deeply but a science fiction film should not allow the mind to fill in such scenarios. They are supposed to create illusions of the possible (in this film that only happened once with the paper-phone) whilst also endearing and entertaining.This film was all those things but none of those things. Firstly, it was very entertaining on an action level, albeit I did expect at least one severed limb when several men are trisected. I was endeared through the character of the child (6) and the exhibition of his innocence but was drastically underwhelmed by the lack of dialog from 6. The entertainment was constantly maintained throughout almost belligerently with constant assaults on the senses, perhaps to distract us of the constant mesh-mash cut and paste of the CGI.I could go on but I will not. This is a film where you must leave your brain at the door, surgically remove all critique and sit back and try to enjoy with the aid of only match-sticks separating your eye lids. All-in-all this is not a bad film but at the same time it is so bad it's good (for want of a better phrase).p.s. I wrote this 47 minutes into the movie and I hope I'm proved wrong in the next 32.John Christopher Howe",

The concept of Ultraviolet is simple: Come up with a flimsy plot, put a hot girl in a sexy outfit, and you've got yourself 1 hour of entertainment. NOT! OK, the plot... Well, there really was none... There was no character development, and no coherence what so ever. After an hour, a pseudo romantic scene was thrown in, probably because the had forgotten it. And just as suddenly as it came, it went out.But who cares? I already knew that. I just wanted to see some martial art-style fighting. But the fights where even worse! Violet takes op a hundred guys at a time, and never even so much as blinks with here eyes. That works for a computer-program in Matrix II, but not for someone who tries to be 'human'. The fight scenes are very short to, so the movie doesn't get exiting, ever! Anyhow, I'd advise you not to watch this movie, but really... All the bad critics can't describe how terrible this movie is, so see for yourself...",

            "content": "UltravioletKurt Wimmer, after the artistic success (commercial result is a different story) of his first \"big\" and high-budget movie - \"Equilibrium\", decided to follow the path set by himself. The path of film based on a futuristic design and pessimistic vision of future world. But there was also one question coming with those ideas: \"doesn't a thin line between daub (kitsch) and effectiveness make it too hard to repeat the success of the previous Wimmer's production?\"I'll get straight to the point, without describing the plot (it can be read from the any movie database or form the back cover of the film). \"Ultraviolet\" is filled with the computer generated effects. The whole city, background and environment design resembles a game \"Mirrors Edge\" (although it was made later) - everything is sterile, clean and shining. This procedure vest the movie with a certain climate, which is a positive aspect of all visual effects. But mentioned sterility is also a disadvantage, when it comes to the fighting or action scenes. Remember \"Equilibrium\" and sparing but realistic (as beating the whole army by one man can be :D) battle sequences? Wimmer tried, ironically, to copy himself, but something just didn't work out. Fight scenes are too exaggerated (especially when you see Jovovich instead of tough Bale beating the hell out of the opponents :D) - \"playing with gravitation\" moments aren't the good idea...And I'm asking: \"Where the hell is blood?!?\". When opponents are wearing white outfits, they're almost asking to be all covered in their own plasma after deadly strikes performed by Violet with the use of a katana...Instead of that we have a dead bodies without a tiny scratch...I conclude then, that people in future world have water in their veins...Although all those flaw, it's still a pleasure to watch the combat, I can even write, that it's the best part of the whole movie (unfortunatelly)...Bad conceptions are mixed with some good ones (flaming swords moving in the dark, UZI-swords...). But you can base the whole movie on fights, can you?And there appears a problem...\"Equilibrium\" had a story with some trashy moments, but it still is kind of moving. After watching that film, you could still remember some characteristic scenes. \"Ultraviolet\" lacks a good, even just a little complex plot. There is something about two races; about a kid, who is supposed to save the world (of one of the \"species\"); finally, there is also rather unconvincing Jovovich saving whatever she can...The point is, that the scenario, which was a strong side of \"Equilibrium\", in this case has a task to be an excuse for fighting scenes and accumulation of F/X...F/X, which are really bad outside the \"battle\" area. In the scene, where Violet is riding on a bike on a Sky-scraper, the animation is so jumping and unfluent, that it resembles the one of the \"B-movies\" (do not mistake with \"Bee Movie\" :D). Unfortunately, there are a lot of moments, where the bad visual effects are visible - this fact is unacceptable in a movie, which was supposed to be based on afore-said.Milla's acting fits pretty good to the trashy character of the movie. What's strange, she plays very differently. Sometimes Jovovich acts good, without major flaws, just to turn to the level far away from \"average\". Other actors (like William Fitchner from \"Prison Break\", Nick Chinlund - main bad guy or Cameron Bright - 6th, a \"save-the-world\" kid) did their job at least fine.It's really hard to summarize the review. It seems, that Wimmer stepped into the trap, which follows the creators of \"future-pesymistic\" films (like Wachowsky Bros.) - first movie is made with love, emotions and ideas, in the sequel/another production directors focus on the F/X, whole areola and usage of budget. On the other hand, maybe \"Equilibrium\" was that good, because there wasn't enough money to fulfill Kurt dreams about \"epic battle sequences\"? He had to rely on rather more realistic combinations than on computer effects...Overall, \"Ultraviolet\" is a \"watch-one-time-n'-forget\" production. I appreciate the design, I pleasured my eyes with brawls, but I also forgot the plot as fast as it takes to change the channel on TV...These give us a picture of a totally average movie - nothing more, nothing less.Grade: 5/10 PS: It's my first review written in English, so please, be understanding ;).",

'Ultraviolet' takes place in the not so distant future where the government have been over powered by a money hungry drug company which aided in the development of a virus which \"enhanced\" humans to a new level, although the testing went to far and soon leaked into the world causing an epidemic, which the drug company used to their advantage in profit. Over the course of 15 years the drug company did everything in their power to eliminate this \"NEW Race\" of people and they are now on the verge of extinction......here enters our heroin.Violet herself as a character has some depth, but not quite deep enough, almost to the point where you sympathize with her, but you don't want to! The Story is flimsy and has many holes which obviously were not and could not be filled in by the conclusion (probably why this film is only 85 minutes long). Outside of Violet, NO other characters have depth and meaning, some just look pretty on screen, much like Milla.Now comes my \"Pros\" of the film. 'Ultraviloet' had some amazing visuals and they managed to blend the live action and CGI very well, in fact I think they did an even better job than the 'Matrix Sequels' and the fact the film looked as though it were a moving comic book added to its charm. The action/martial arts were well above par for most American films of similar taste, and I must say, I am always impressed when it is pulled off and I think the film makers were successful there.In my humble opinion, had they spent just 30 more days on the screenplay/story, it would have been MUCH better, but hindsight is 20/20 and they'll just have to remember that for next time.OVERALL, 5.5 out 10 for Lack of story and Character Substance, but Visuals and SFX brought the score back up....My Advice, Wait till DVD or better yet, BARGAIN CINEMA!",

The plot was fast and almost nonexistent and some of the lines were ridiculous. \"You got 'hemo'-blood on me.... It's on\"I feel sorry for Milla for having to take part of this movie, not a great title to add to her list. If you still want to see this movie don't go in expecting much. There are some cool costumes and some of the concepts like how she gets her weapons are cool. The fight scenes were also mildly disappointing! She dodged a lot and the people all ran into each other and then she finished with a pose after almost every fight scene.",

The action scenes involving Milla are wonderfully done and I'm happy to see that she is capable of the fight scenes. Having seen Cameron Bright in a Stargate SG-1 episode I was happy to see that he was being used in other settings.

I found the character Violet engaging and interesting, someone you wanted to learn more about, and who could surprise you with her actions and thoughts. I did *not* predict most of the plot twists and turns. Unlike many recent action movies, it did *not* go overboard for blood, gore, and drawn-out-punching scenes.

Bullet time/CGI overload: Check (Matrix, etc) And it starts to become hard to believe that this was put out by Screen Gems to make a lot on the box office.

It ties the action scenes together with tacky dialogue and some scenes that seem to have been ripped straight off the reels of a romance or drama movie. Even the final climax is a huge let down when she faces down an opponent who is seemingly a real challenge, but turns out is really just another nancy and even admits it too.Spoilers below: The plot itself utterly incomprehensible and the movie staggers along tying one completely unrelated scene to another. The most glaring question is if she has the prenatural ability to effortlessly kill anything and everything in sight, which is made pretty obvious by the fact that everyone she meets dies within about two minutes of appearing on screen and she has UNLIMITED AMMO and the uncanny ability to go into bullet time, why doesn't she just storm the fortress and kill everybody in the first place?! Further, what does the boy in a suitcase have to do with anything? He just stands around, real quiet, very, very, slowly, dying. Also why are the soldiers so completely useless?

On the one hand, I was looking forward to this because Kurt Wimmer did Equilibrium, which in my opinion was marred only because the action sequences, while cool, were too few and far between to keep me from being bored...oh, and that Preston (Christian Bale's character) was invincible. I like to see the hero or heroine overcome a challenge with at least some difficulty.Ultraviolet addressed some concerns but created some new ones.I love action movies. The more high-speed and crazy the action, the better. I'm a huge fan of suspending my disbelief and enjoying the ride. Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children is one of my favorite movies, who cares how high Cloud just jumped? Whatever. So I'm not too deep on realism. But Ultraviolet took some things too far.If Preston was invincible, he'd still be no match for Violet. Nothing in the world can stop this chick. That irked me and bored me to tears...all the action sequences were the same. I was really hoping there would be this seriously powerful Hemophage (preferably female) warrior that would give Violet a run for her money, at least do her some damage in a fight. But no, we get Violet destroying a million guards throughout the movie without taking a lick of damage until the final fight, and even then she didn't exactly squirm in pain. Throughout the movie, she acted like she was actually worried about the guards catching her, but the whole time I was thinking, \"What is she so worried about? She can just shatter their cheap glass armor and destroy them like she's been doing.\" Yes, the action looks good...until you realize she's just one woman taking out dozens of guards in scene after scene after scene. No challenging fights, only one duel in the end that was moderately, but not extremely impressive...and even when she comes up against her own superhuman kind, she destroys them effortlessly. Add all this together and you have a ho-hum action presentation.I haven't even started on the story, and I won't. Don't try to follow it. Why was the colors of her outfit changing? Dimension-compression technology to hide weapons on her person? Way too far-fetched for me... and that's saying something.Oh, and that motorcycle chase is the worst piece of CGI garbage I've ever seen in my life. When she leaps and lands on the roof, it just looks...broken.So why a 4, and not a 0? Because, Milla does look good. She's beautiful, and she's a great actress. Not an easy combination to find in a female action star. She shows strength and emotion and balances them well. She needs to be in a movie with a better concept (more down to earth and realistic, but not too realistic) to make better use of her talents.I say rent it. Who knows, you might enjoy it. Try it at least. It's not something I'd rent again and especially not buy. But it is better than Equilibrium in the \"keep me from falling asleep\" factor.",

Equilibrium is a good movie : sometimes we can notice some underlying bad choices about a few details, which is why it's a good movie and not an excellent movie. With Ultraviolet, the director show what he can do without a huge budget and a good crew : wasting my time.But I had fun with the first two minutes, before it collapsed.And I can add :Poor audio mixing, music is way too low (and is poorly composed) - Almost no sound design, most sounds come from free sound banks - Music starts and stops randomly - Epic music can start in the middle of nowhere, when nothing happens - The end is terrible, it's like I handled the 3D myself with my average laptop ! - Explosions are a jokeI'll have to watch another movie now for forgetting this before going to bed.",

This movie really seems like it was written and filmed within days.The action is terrible, people don't bleed which is highly unnatural, not to mention all the actors have the worst choreography I've ever seen.Then there's the dialog, essentially all it is, is one liners, the entire freaking' dialog, there's no actual sensible speech it's all \"Bring it on!\", \"Oh it's on!\" and other random one liners that'll make you think you're watching \"bring it on\"...with much worse action.You know how Equilibrium was able to bring together story and action together beautifully? Well UV does the opposite, in fact it trumps that, it just obliterates the word horrible. At the start of the movie you think \"Ok, the stories not great, but at least it's there.\" However by the end you're thinking \"Oh my goodness...it's like they forgot what they were writing about and decided to let monkeys take over the project.\" Don't watch this, go get Equilibrium instead, or if you're sick of EQ, get the Matrix, 5th Element, anything to keep you away from this.

Even the three people sitting in front of me in the theater were chuckling. The Dialog (or lack of it) made me cringe; very forced and unbelievable; bad character interaction. The general feel of setting was also nonexistent. The world that served as the movie's back drop had no depth what so ever. And about plot...a plot? what plot?... Sterile, is quite possibly the best word that describes this movie. Quite fitting for this film actually.Mila may have been all the movie had going for it, however, that heavy use of lens filtering was seriously over done. There were some parts were Mila's nose (and the rest of her face) was completely blurred out. Think of the close up portrait shots of women on classic Star Trek, yeah blurry like that but times ten. I almost thought I needed glasses or something. As for the action scenes, they were okay, but the camera was zoomed in too close, cut too fast, and again everything was a blur. I also have to agree with one other comment made by another, there was one part that was quite a blatant rip-off of the Matrix (you'll know it when you see it).Sure, the hot heroine in tight outfits kicking butt thing can be really cool, but it can in no way substitute for quality film making.",

I could not agree with that.Mostly, I've waited for evolution of \"gun-kata\", mixed martial art and gun fight style, introduced by Wimmer in \"Equilibrium\". And yes, there are a lot fight sequences in \"Ultraviolet\". Peformed by Mila Yovovich, hemophage Violet is an ultimate battle machine, crushing up human solders, smashing Blood Chingo clan mobster and cutting up her brothers-in-arms of hemophage species . \"Killing is what I do\", says Violet, and yes, she is really good in that.

And this kind of movie should have it's own rules.Yes, computer graphics. Frankly speaking, blurred CG style of \"Ultraviolet\" reminded me \"Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow\" a lot. Now people say, that there are badly done and looks very cheap. Yes, there are several scenes, where lack of good rendering is so obvious, but in common, visual style is enjoyable. Color codes, industrial environment of future world, outfits of people: all very close to comics-style. Not even far so good as Frank Miller's \"Sin City\", but still Wimmer created his own vision how graphic novel adaptation should look like. There are several scenes, that thrilled me, for example, roof action with Blood Chingo clan. It was an eye-candy: innovative and stylish. Thus, everything that was about Archministry complex performed quite bad: low-rendered blocks, which reminded me a straw packs, fire in the Dome. Especially, when it was repeated 3 times. Nice idea - poor realization. I guess it is not reasonable to expect nice dialogs in action movie. Main accent focused on visual style and fighting scenes. And i think, that Wimmer not failed in that. Yes, this is not a perfect movie, far from it. But not a complete failure also.",

Every single soldier runs into a room and has a smoke before deciding that they should perhaps fire at her. But, oh no, too late, she stabbed you. She even manages to take out an entire squad of Chinese gangsters by dodging out of the way of their bullets and letting all twenty-some-odd of them shoot each other, down to the very last man. Good job guys, maybe next time you shouldn't shoot at a target with your own men behind it.

Look, it's okay if in the first fight, the protagonist can annihilate their scrub foes without breaking a sweat to establish their mad skills. But after that, you have to up the ante. You have to place the hero in situations where there is at least some chance of defeat, where the odds against them keep going up and up so the hero has to up their game too. That's why the Matrix ends when Neo becomes the One, because it's boring to watch an invincible guy (just like it's boring to play a video game with the invincibility code on the entire time) But Violet is pretty much invincible the whole movie. Every fight is way too simple. Every time she is surrounded, she just waves her sword around in a circle and they all fall down (at the same time). Every platoon of soldiers can be taken out with a few shots and minimal dodging. The difference between the action here and in Equilibrium is because in EQ you could observe the technique of the gunkata, you could see (if not exactly believe) how a man, surrounded, could perfectly dodge and counterattack to defeat his opponents. Here, the opponents are all idiots who are simply incompetent. When Violet finally faces some vamps, I thought okay, here we go!, but she defeats them even easier than the generico soldiers. She pulls their hair! She spins around and they all drop! At least if their was some kind of explanation, some kind of reasoning as to why she is sooo much better than everybody else, even her own kind, than at least... No, it wouldn't really help, but it would take away some of the sting.",

Except for one part... let me tell you what they must have been thinking for a scene. \"Hey, I know we're in the middle of a war, and the entire human world is depending on me.. but.. hey lets go to the park!\" ... wtf? The fight scenes were done badly. The dialog was unoriginal, and sounded like it was written by a 8 year old. The characters were insanely bland, and flat. I suppose you could claim that since it was a comic book series first, that it would make sense for those characters to be that way, but they seriously lacked any real meaning. Also, it looked like they pasted like the same scenes together, over and over again, to get the correct amount of filler. There was no back story, no explanation, and no real meaning. It was a waste of my 7.50... I sat there and thought to myself.. \"I gave up Date Movie for this?\"",

But then I heard the bad reviews from every source I knew so I finally saw it on DVD from Netflix. I gave the movie six stars for 6 reasons: 1 point for Milla Jovovich, partial nudity and sex appeal, 1 point for original fight scenes and cool martial arts, 1 point for gadgets, vehicles and futuristic devices, 1 point for \"Violet's\" character in the movie because I wanted her to win in the end, 1 point for audio, which wasn't groundbreaking but still a good listen, 1 last point for a story that could have potentially been an awesome movie. The director Kurt Wimmer is the main person responsible for the 4 failings I found with this film. 1 point lost for the story he wrote because each action sequence was Violet versus the easily dis-patchable enemies. No puzzles or neat strategies whatsoever; just kill all those dudes. Kurt also forgot to show or tell us why Violet changes colors. Really, why!? It helped her escape this one time but maybe if she didn't have purple hair to begin with she could probably hide more easily. The second point was lost for overdoing the CGI effects as happened in Superman Returns. Why do the people in the film not have normal skin with pores, wrinkles and all that good stuff? It's like they airbrushed the reality out of the film. The third point they lost from me was taking the original Violet from a nurse, a normal person and making her the greatest super-person of all in the movie. Why was she the one vampire better than everyone else? Finally another point was lost because of the dialog. None of it was very natural sounding and the actors didn't have much to work with. The evil genius who rules the world asks Violet: \"Are you mental?\", which is probably a joke but it wasn't even funny as an afterthought. He could have said, \"Are you scared?\" or \"Did you bring enough bullets?\" or even \"Are you signing autographs after you kill this many people?\" On the Sony DVD in the making of section they tell us that Kurt made up the whole story and did all the directing. He really could have used someone to tell him what was wrong with his movie beforehand. But I guess he likes having his butt kissed so it doesn't matter if his movies end up sucking.",

I don't recall another movie where all aspects of the movie just failed to live up to any decent standards. The plot was just as described in other postings, as umm... missing. The special effects reminded me of what people probably thought what would have been cutting edge maybe 15 years ago, like what video graphics are. They are thrilling in that they are user interactive and have depth and resonate entertainment. But i don't want to watch a video game for hours, just to see the graphics. So sad and unbelievably a waste of a dollar and an hour. I honestly want my dollar back, but i'm not going to go to the theater and ask for it back... just seems even more sad. Its not their fault that this movie was crap, and i enjoy their theater.

            "content": "I have to honestly say that I did enjoy the movie Ultraviolet for what it was. However if we take the movie apart and discuss the plot, script, acting, scene arranging etc...I would have to say that I was disappointed. The movie had beautiful potential -- the special affects were amazing; the way people looked and the colours were like candy to my eyes. I even liked the how the characters were able to manifest weapons thru thin air. At first the fighting scenes were cool...yes they could have lasted longer and yes in some cases we wanted to actually SEE the fight scenes instead of hear them...but the viewer quickly realizes that most of the fighting scenes were choreographed the same way...all the bad guys circle Mila and she ends up killing them off in like 2 minutes. Practically the only thing different in those fighting scenes are the background colours and Mila's outfits-- which were sexy by the way (I'm a straight chick but I can appreciate another woman's body...cuz I wish I had it!)haha. It was cool that her hair and suits could change colour... I don't necessarily feel that they needed to explain why but it would have been nice.I do however feel they should have explained things clearly especially at the beginning of the movie. I didn't find out till halfway thru that a hemophage was the same as a vampire. The only thing I noticed was that they had sharp incisors but there was nothing about the group of actors with those incisors to connect that they were vampires-- I.E. they were able to withstand sunlight, you never saw them drink blood etc. Interesting enough it wasn't until practically the last scene of the movie that we see Mila's sharp incisors.I also never heard of Ultraviolet until this movie so without the character development I had no clue who she was and what she was about and I honestly felt disconnected from the movie because of that. I agree with most people on here that the movie lacked severe character development...almost as if they wanted the fast pace action -- when there was some -- to cover this up. It also seems that out of the blue the hard A$$ warrior develops \"motherly\" type feelings for Cameron Bright's character SIX. She learned early on that he was a weapon designed to destroy all \"her kind\". One would think at least in the interest of Self preservation that she would have put a bullet thru his head and asked questions later but we know that the \"plot\" hinged on Mila's affection for cameron so the movie would have ended then and there. I understand later on we find out that Mila thinks cameron's blood could cure her...but why would she want to be cured when if she was human again she would be ordinary. I also recall her saying that she \"Hates Humans\" so it seems there is a bit of contradiction there...like there is with most things in the movie. OK so we ignore that and see that she protects cameron because she thinks that he can cure her. They overdid it I think with the music rising and the tears falling...I just do not believe the audience bought that Mila came to care so quickly for Cameron and vice versa. Cameron is after all a clone of Dax so he is not even human.. haha Another thing that bothered me is that it was almost predictable that the Dax character by Nick Chinlund was a hemophage but how was he able to escape detection in a world that constantly scans blood? In a nutshell I feel that the film was made on a first draft script. They did not feel that they needed to write and rewrite and double check it before the film was made. The potential was obviously there but it was not translated to the screen very well. I am one of those people who pay to see one movie and see another movie or two for \"free\" so I am glad that I did not spend money to see it...but I can't honestly say it was a waste of my time. Like Mila opens and closes with, the world I live in is very strange or whatever I forget... I am gonna close with my opening statement which is that I did enjoy the movie Ultraviolet for what it was.",

By the overall look I mean the following: By using a High Def camera like the Sony 950 you are working with broadcast people and equipment, this automatically results in the total smooth video-feel you get for a futuristic film. How wrong. If you want to do High Def, you must use HD movie material and people who know how film works. There are camera's that give exactly the same depth of field as 35 mm. For instance the Dalsa or even the Arri D20. The biggest problem however is in the the compression of the so-called tapes. Whoever screams that tapes are uncompressed, don't believe it. Tapes are a compression 2:1 even the SRW tapes. The only thing that works is uncompressed HD. But if you want to know about that, they first have to come to the major league of HD. ;-)",

Everything that is good in Equilibrium is torn to shreds by poor imitation and overuse in Ultraviolet.The dialogue is forced by almost every actor, I've seen more emotion in the expression of cartoon characters. Milla Jovovich is absolutely stunning but lacks any credibility. She is the only woman i believed could pull off the whole action hero thing (Fifth Element, Resident Evil 1+2) But this performance was sadly lacking in the qualities which set her apart in other movies. 2 movies in a row for Cameron Bright playing child with a cure to a disease, and he didn't learn anything from the X-men role that was apparent in this movie. All the vampires were terrible with really clich\u00e9d dialogue and wooden performances all round. The guy who plays the uber-bad guy is really enjoying his role it seems but it's predictable and you've seen it all before. The only good performance ,in my opinion, was by the only actor to appear in both Equilibrium and this movie (even though he plays a similar type of role), William Fichtner ,from TV's Invasion, is pretty good playing a very similar role to Kris Kristofferson in Blade. The similarities are many between these movies, not least the end of the movie on top of the building, which is an unashamed copy of the end of one of those movies where Blade lays the female vampire out on the roof just as the sun comes up. Well believe me I could go on about this movies flaws: Bad dubbing, too many sword fights, the fact that the soldiers pause each time they catch her for no apparent reason, the absolutely rubbish gun fight on the roof which is supposed to be something like the Gun-Kata from Equilibrium.I reckon you'll be curious to see it seeing how badly I've slated it it.

The only blood that we see in the whole movie is when its some of hers? It was obviously a movie that they removed the blood in order to lower the rating to make it available to a broader audience.The final scene just smacked of 'The Matrix' when Neo went to rescue Morpheus. The snippy computer monitor saying \"Warning: Weapons detected, quantity:.... many\" was just too whimsical and put a bad taste in my mouth.

Both movies introduce really cool concepts; flat plane compression/ dimensional storage or, something like that/ gravity dampening belt and all sorts of eye-candy for the fantasy action addict.I see this as another movie that is a lot about style like a music video with a story and it inspired me on my quest to concretely visualize the perfect action movie for my next script.",

Overall, the film was well choreographed with Wushu, well decorated with extravagant colors, and had an entertaining heroine (milla). On the other side, the dialog was lacking substance, the characters lacked depth, and it was difficult to care about the challenge they faced. If you wanted a dramatic film, then this isn't for you.

It was not simply that the enemies missed the main character with their weapons... they hardly ever fired them. It is an insult to all viewers when 30 soldiers with assault rifles rush at a woman using Uzis.

The plot setup was pathetic and nonsensical, giving me the impression within the first 5 minutes that this movie had not given proper attention to back-story elucidation or pacing. The motivation for the whole story (the boy) was dropped in as an afterthought. \"I come from a world you won't understand\", muses the main character in her opening voice-over. Damn straight you won't understand it. No sympathy for any of the main characters, as their motivations were completely non-believable.I got seriously tired of Mila standing there all dramatic for a full 10 seconds after each round of dispatching a hundred faceless (well, gas-masked) lackeys.

Half the time the shots have a glossy color saturation to them as well that's distracting and looks like some kind of lubricant is on the screen. The music isn't bad as much as it puts you to sleep during boring expose and makes it even worse. It's just used in bad ways. The editing is horrible as well. The crowning achievement aside from the CGI is without a doubt Milla Jovovich. Her character Violet is so over the top, out of place, exaggerated and stupid while always trying to look like a badass its fascinating.

            "content": "A strange sci-fi story with often hilariously bad acting and cool swordplay!\n\nDirector Kurt Wimmer (Equilibrium) somehow lost all his taste, yet delivers an all style with little substance for his science-fiction action-thriller Ultraviolet (2006). I cannot believe Kurt Wimmer directed the beautiful and touching Equilibrium as well as the gaudy and melodramatic Ultraviolet. I do have a soft spot for Ultraviolet as it's so bad that it is genuinely entertaining.\n\nIt's hard to believe that Ultraviolet was constantly used in blu-ray advertisements for ultra-violet high definition as the Sony digital cameras used for Ultraviolet look hideous now. Why does every person have a glow to them? Ultraviolet's CGI is horrendous. Visual effects artists Steven Calcote, Neil Greenberg, Victor Wong, and Rongguo Fang made near video game cutscene level garbage for the wide shots of the city and ships flying awkwardly. It looks like Playstation 1 level graphics. The glowing purple fringes of Violet's hair looked neat and the practical effect of the flaming swords in the darkness is killer. Ultraviolet's effects are so hit or miss.\n\nArthur Wong Ngok-Tai's cinematography has all these inspired wide shots that look neat still and his hyper stylized camera work makes the sword and gunfights look cool at least. Alongside Kurt Wimmer's frenetic direction, Ultraviolet stabs, shoots, and slashes into glorious mediocrity. Choo Sung Pong's production design looks like its $30 million low budget. Many of the sets just look like Hong Kong and China where Ultraviolet was filmed. The sci-fi buildings are neat in a way, but never believable. Bernardo Trujillo, Chong Kwok-Wing, and William Kan's art direction is too cartoony to ever feel grounded. Roberto Bonelli, Chung Kim Wai, and Rufina Lo's sparse set decoration is minimalist for that sci-fi feel. It can also feel empty though.\n\nThere's plenty of style to Wimmer's direction with Ultraviolet's sleek and sterile world, afraid of disease, but there's just too much of everything. We never get to know Violet as it's all running around shooting people. Wimmer's writing just rips off The Matrix' action with Underworld's world and vampire lore and blood concepts to Blade's swordplay style. Ultraviolet has a place in my heart as one of the most entertaining bad movies ever made. Editor William Yeh's rapid and confusing cuts are so bafflingly bad. It looks like a parody of itself during the fights and the conversations look slick, but often veer off into the absurd. It's infamously terrible for a reason with awkward dialogue and hilariously bad acting from the supporting cast. \n\nMilla Jovovich is surprisingly fun as Violet with her lethal threats and killer sword choreography. She's a real action star and even delivers a bit of dramatic acting that can be bad, but she's not the problem with Ultraviolet. Cameron Bright is pretty deadpan as this sympathetic sick kid. Nick Chinlund is outrageous as the way too over the top dictator. His final fight is cool alongside Milla Jovovich, but his delivery is so mid-2000's. Sebastien Andrieu is awful as this strange French rebel. William Fichtner is fantastic and empathetic as Garth with a more sincere and nuanced performance. He's just a great actor even in garbage. All the other supporting actors are horrible, but laughably so, honestly.\n\nComposer Klaus Badelt's score has epic symphonic elements and fun techno throughout Ultraviolet, so I cannot complain about the music very much. The sound team came up with intense gun firing noises, but mixed these noises too quietly compared to the blaring score. The sword swinging noises are great. I actually love costume designers Joseph A. Porro and Jackie Cheng's skin tight bodysuits for Milla. They're colorful, sexy, and cool. They always show off her tight abs with a bare midriff among her ever changing tops and pants with these knee high boots. The purple wig on Milla is very pretty. Gemma Waugh and Marie Nardella's make-up is lovely for Milla as she looks angelic.\n\nIn all, Ultraviolet is a fairly fast paced 87 minutes of over the top acting and even crazier action sequences within this ultra serious sci-fi story. Can you believe this was actually about a vampire causing disease and a ruthless dictatorship that Milla Jovovich slashes through with her rectangular sword?",

I loved her, loved her, loved her in The Fifth Element and her Resident Evil work was okay too. Ultraviolet has a barely acceptable plot, somewhat engaging screen adaptation, very impressive CGI overall, top-notch cinematography taste & vision. Milla looks spectacular and action scenes were well-done. I enjoyed 90% of this bombastic sci-fi, heroine extravaganza. Nanotech'd weaponry and bullets \"from outta nowhere\" was a new twist for me but how they could be fashioned so incredibly fast is beyond the hard-science I understand -- unless the weapons and ammo pre-existed in some quasi-energy-matter state, superpacked in storage for rapid retrieval. The 10% of the movie that failed me was the CGI'd motorcycle chase looked a but comic-booky in spots and NOT realistic. Never mind what Violet pulled off was essentially impossible, it just looked a bit unfinished in the CGI arena, textures not added in spots, breaking glass looking too drawn versus really breaking, small stuff really but it is just that sort of special effects that makes special effects NOT special. If you can tell is is CGI-done then it is subpar work. You shouldn't see most special effects other than slo-mo, ramping and the stuff we all were wow'd by in The Matrix. One last beef -- how in the world does Violet dodge 25 or thirty gun experts shooting at her at close range from 360 degrees surrounding her? Sure. maybe the first couple guys are stupid enuff to die in crossfire but ALL of them doing that? Please So, overall decent flick.",

Ouch! Those set colours!), disgusting on the ears (where are the sound effects? What's going on with those levels??!!), and disgusting in plot and dialogue (it's not cool, it makes no sense).\nIt could have been a smart spiritual-successor to Equilibrium (which in itself is a fun but completely terrible diversion) but it's an objectively bad film, even the action is either poorly conceived, executed, or edited to oblivion. The cast (except for the seldom terrible William Fitchner) are comically bad, the tech doesn't make sense, the soundtrack is as ugly as the world and so, so, so many scenes are just laughably bad.

Sixteen minutes into the movie, he walked out to the screen next door to watch Dave Chappelle's Block Party. Yes, it is that bad and, honestly, I'm surprised he even lasted that long. What's my excuse? I don't know, I'm guess I'm a glutton for bad-movie punishment. I paid the dime so I was forcing myself to do the time.\n\nActing: 0\n\nBeginning: 3\nNo, it doesn't take sixteen minutes to decide this movie is horrible. It's really more like ten. The beginning sets the movie up in no particularly clever way. It explains the laughable Blood Wars and tries to get you to care about the main character. I'm currently watching it right now and the nose plugs alone are killing me. You'll understand that reference if you decide to take the awful journey that is this movie.\n\nCharacters: 5\n\nCinematography/Visuals: 2\nDuring the making of this, someone actually presented the idea, \"So how cool would it be if the main character could change outfits on the spots like three times in every scene?\" The worst part is, someone actually agreed with that dunderhead. The outfits are only a smidge of what makes the cinematics so bad. The special effects are a nightmare which bog down the actions scenes. The world itself is so cardboard that you feel like a backdrop will fall down at any moment. I really don't know what the angle was here.\n\nConflict: 3\nEvery single bodyguard in this world should be fired. I really don't think the main character gets touched the entire movie as she tears through people left and right. My annoyance level was through the roof with the weak action sequences from start to finish. They were focused too much on making things look cool than they were having actual scenes with meat.\n\nEntertainment Value: 3\nAfter you get done cringing at how bad this movie is, you will finally settle in. You might just have a laugh or two at how utterly ridiculous and stupid this movie is. That, to me, is worthy of a 3.\n\nMemorability: 4\n\nPace: 3\nAt one point during the movie, when they had a chance to dive full into more action, they decide instead to have a sequence where the main character and the boy she is protecting stop to play at a playground. This should tell you all you need to know about how slow this movie moves. The fact that you really don't understand what's happening the entire movie only serves to make things even worse. Nightmare.\n\nPlot: 5\nI am being very generous. I will admit I do have a soft spot in my heart for sci-fi as I feel there are a lot of moving parts with character building and world creation.  With Ultraviolet, it's not just bad sci-fi, it's bad PERIOD.\n\nResolution: 4\n\nOverall: 32\nI will leave you with this: Sitting through this movie will make you a dumber person. That is all.",

Considering the lack of humor and emotion displayed by the performers, one might assume that their only participation was to allow their three-dimensional images to be programmed into a computer and reproduced.

My goodness, the effects. I can see why Kurt Wimmer stuck permanently to writing after this movie because the effects are some of the worst I have seen in a 21st-century blockbuster in quite a while. Theyre so blatantly unfinished! It doesn't help that the movie's really short which had a clear effect on the movie's pacing.

Too bad that we'll never get to see the full 122 minute film, as the cut scenes might have added in more of the human interaction the final film gives short shrift to.

Now for my two good, the action sequences because they are alright crazy and hilarious to watch, their so cheesy that's it's fun to watch, and milla jovovichs character violet and she appeal to the audience, that's the only reason that somebody would see this movie at all, it's because the poster for this movie is milla jovovich and her skinny stomach showing, not for oh it's some kind of superhero movie.

I guess they burned through their special effects budget showing the same 5 idiotic looking 'troupers' getting mowed down again and again. The plot goes beyond nonsensical; the main character's motivations are completely inscrutable. Early in the movie she claims she 'hate's all humans' and wants to kill them all. Five minutes later (seriously, I'm not exaggerating here) she's massacring every vampire she can find, including some that were previously her friends and compatriots to protect a human child who's going to die in a couple of hours anyway. If you've ever gotten a kick out of watching a truly terrible piece of cinema with some friends I whole-heartedly recommend this movie. But if you're expecting a serious movie avoid it all costs.

Couple that with an overly elaborate and non sensical plot involving vampires? and a creepy mute kid who may (or may not) be the savior of the universe, then you know the director is grasping for something, anything to make this movie a stand-out in the unfortunate (Thanks Alien!) age of the now tired trend of kick butt heroines in the Tomb Raider/Resident Evil/Aeon Flux/Elektra vein.

I heard all of the negative press concerning \"Ultraviolet\" going in, but despite it all, i kept telling myself \"this is the guy who made EQUILIBRIUM. I will give it a fighting chance\". It saddens me to say that, for the most part, all of the bad stuff that you've heard concerning \"ULTRAVIOLET\" is true. Part of the blame falls on Milla Jovavich. We have to face it: She is no Christian Bale. She just does not possess the acting skills to carry a film. She's damned pretty to look at, but man, was that performance terrible. Another part of the problem seemed to be that director Wimmer was attempting to take all of the elements that worked in \"Equilibrium\", and then amp them up to the EXTREME. He sort of \"TEMPLE OF DOOMED\" this one, by going TOOO far with everything. The action is quite often incoherent, and some of the CGI is horrid. The epic one-liners are just cheesy. And there seems to be more logical reason that these people had to be VAMPIRES. That NEVER ONCE plays into the story. A missed element, or a pointless one, i don't know. That's not to say this movie is COMPLETELY without redemption. The colouring looks GREAT, and there are some neat gadgets for scifi fanatics (love those disposable phones!

But Ultraviolet, if I could sum it up one thing as one of the worst movies in her career. The reason why I'm sticking with the Unrated DVD version is because Sony's company Screen Gems didn't do a damn job showing how this movie should've been good in the first place. Instead, they gave me a PG-13 rated version that absolutely makes no sense because this was originally supposed to be an R-rated effort to promote the movie in the style of my favorite cult classic action movies \"Equilibrium\" (FYI, it was supposed to be a spiritual successor to the film) and adding insult to injury, some of the fight scenes had to be taken out due to time constrainsts and the confusing story which is entirely featured Violet's parents killed by the resistance instead of Violet's demise just absolutely rubbish. The director of the film did a terrible job along with a use of underutilized CGI special effects that seemed to run its own course and Ultraviolet's backstory is outdated (if you read the novel, that's where she tells the story all by herself). Even worse, the theatrical version is exactly 88 minutes too short (if you compare to the unrated version which is almost 1 minute). Ultraviolet is less like a video game movie but with little or more than a clone of Tomb Raider. The Blu-Ray version is also horrendous but sadly it doesn't have any extras. Skip it! Matter of fact, don't even buy this crap in the Wal-Mart bargain bins. After all, one studio's flop is another movie's failure.",

Ultraviolet is like Kill Bill, without the blood or the potty-mouth. The characters are wooden, the graphics were dated even in 2006, and for some reason the camera was shaky in the ALL-CGI PARTS. I liked Violet's costume, and the effect of her hair and clothes changing colours, while Six's was a bit stereotypical for a sci-fi movie (all-silver clothing. Come on Kurt, really?) and... what's his name, the bad guy, with SILVER PLUGS IN HIS NOSE... ugh. I hope he never lives it down! There are a couple of plotholes: for one, the movie's over, but now Violet is going to die offscreen and Six will probably kick the bucket sometime soon due to Violet turning him into a hemophage. Also, the bad guy was a clean freak. WHY? He was a hemophage ALL ALONG, he didn't need to act like he was uber paranoid about the virus. Speaking of which, HOW HAS HE LIVED FOR SO LONG? He was the first person to be infested with the virus! Christ! Now, i've given this movie 3 for a couple reasons: I have the DVD version, which includes a commentary. It gets a bit dull sometimes, but Milla is one of the better commentators. She shared stories about on the set, she cracked a few jokes, she named a few techniques you see in the film. Very fun. Also, the paper phone was cool. I liked how they had phones made of paper; very cool. I bought this on an impulse, and it was the worst $9 I ever spent. Borrow it from someone if you can, or buy it for under $5; it's all it's worth.",
