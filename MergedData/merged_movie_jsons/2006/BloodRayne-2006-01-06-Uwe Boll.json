            "content": "Just kidding...just kidding!! Why, after wasting nearly 2 hours of my life watching this trash, should I waste another hour or so dissing this movie, when everything about it has already been killed stone dead by previous reviewers? Because, dear friends, I am so excited I just had to share with you my delight at finding the \"worst cameo of all time\", so magnificent in its awfulness that it could (with sheer effort of will) only be equalled, but never beaten.It was Sunday. Raining. What the hell, \"Bloodrayne\" sounded good. Hmmm, Masden, Kingsley, Zane...can't be so bad.After around 20 minutes or so of this \"crowning turd\" of a movie my \"intellectual defence mechanism\" automatically kicked-in and took my mind away to my next vacation, what to have for dinner, and the contents of my Partner's trousers. Sailing away on a sea of serenity(did I actually fall asleep?)I thought myself immune and totally protected from the train wreck of a movie unfolding on the other side of my eyelids. But then....wait! What's this? Snippets of dialogue totally unconnected with the Tequilla Sunrise I was drinking began to pervade my mind. Slowly at first, but growing in intensity. Warily, fearful that I may inadvertently catch another glimpse of Ben Kingsley's excruciating acting/staring, I opened one eye. Was I seeing/hearing things? I pulled myself up in the chair and opened the other eye (after assuring myself that Kingsley was nowhere to be seen). There, in front of me...what can never be described by a thousand monkeys on a thousand typewriters for a thousand years. The root canal work of movie making, the Xanadu of awfulness....Meatloaf trying to character-act.I checked out the other movie-goers...hmmm, not many left....and they were all, very much like myself, staring wide eyed and open mouthed at witnessing the birth of a legend. Seriously, it was like watching the first moon landing all over again. This is one piece of crap for man...a whole turd for mankind.I am sorry that I go on a little, but I cannot find words to describe the cameo piece by Meatloaf, in fact probably such words do not exist - they must be invented - \"discrapungent\" - try that one. I can only try to capture the magnificent awfulness by describing the effect that it had on myself and, I suspect, the other viewers.If you haven't seen it (and I beg you all to do so) cut along to any cinema brave enough to show it and set your alarm clock for around 50 minutes. If you have trouble sleeping at the beginning, don't worry, Ben Kingsley will stare you into blessed catatonia....trust me.",

            "review_title": "Confirms the worst of what people think of Boll...",
            "content": "When I heard that Uwe Boll had challenged several of his critics to a boxing match, I thought it was an example of the man failing to understand reactions. Rather than come out looking like a misunderstood hero, he comes off as a spoiled child. So when I hear people calling Uwe the new Ed Wood, I just want to point out that this demonstrates ignorance regarding Wood. It is insulting to the poor guy. You see, Wood made one of the most daring (if staggeringly inept) films that challenged people's perceptions of transvestism and gender roles, long before this became a common theme in Hollywood. His major feature was that he lived only to make films, and did so because of motives other than cash. Boll, on the other hand, says absolutely nothing in his films that is of any value, and has shown himself in the media to be the most cynical, thoughtless idiot that ever drew breath. Another classic example of the difference between Boll and Wood, perfectly illustrated by BloodRayne, is that Wood's films made narrative sense.If you have not played any of the video games upon which BloodRayne is based, then it will make very little sense to you. The parts about Rayne being the child of a vampire and a human, I get, but the film is loaded with references to artifacts that the villain needs in order to gain power, which Rayne must obviously stop him from acquiring. This reminds me of the sequence from Bakshi's adaptation of The Lord Of The Rings in which the explanation of what the One Ring is and what it does was meant to be delivered. By failing to deliver this critical information in a manner that makes sense to the viewer, both films end up disjointed and pointless. Only BloodRayne makes it much, much worse by jumping around from location to location, showing confrontations between Rayne and various enemies without a pause for explanation as to why this is significant. Ten bucks to anyone who can figure out exactly why Boll chose to end the film with a bunch of flashbacks to disjointed events that have no connection to the film's \"present time\", when the climactic slaying would have done just fine.Another of Boll's few talents is to classically miscast. Kristanna Loken is surprisingly good as the titular character, and puts in a far better performance than I would have credited her with after that abysmal Terminator rip-off. It is certainly far better than the film deserves. Michelle Rodriguez looks extremely angry to be there. Matthew Davis has this stupid expression on his face all the time that appears to be him begging for some direction. Michael Madsen, Billy Zane, and Udo Kier literally are on autopilot. But Meat Loaf, the poor guy, seems to be trying to take his role seriously, and never have I see an actor look so uncomfortable in his work. He almost looks as if he is going to have a stroke from all the \"what the hell am I doing here?\" instructions his brain is trying to process. But the real gem here is Ben Kingsley, winner of one Academy Award and nominee for three others. He seriously looks as if he is going to burst out in laughter at any second during his scenes with Loken. And who can honestly blame him?A mention must be made of the abysmal special effects here, too. Boll at least knows that the audience for a film based on this video game expects to see blood, and a lot of it. However, like every other aspect of his films, the delivery is so staggeringly inept that it makes one wonder how Boll can be so blind to this. Not only does the head of one opponent look despicably fake, the looks on the faces of the extras when they are shown chopping things up with their swords is utterly hilarious. Someone had to direct them to assume that expression, as swinging an actual sword hard enough to sever a limb involves enough exertion that one at least pulls some kind of face in the process. They said it best in Showdown In Little Tokyo - beheadings are not as easy as they look. Yet Boll seems to think he can silence individuals who feel he is utterly inept as a director by hitting them. If I could say one thing to his face right now, it would be that keeping silent and working on making a genuinely good film would have worked a lot more.So I mean it when I say this film is not as bad as many others have said - it is even worse. A competent director like Wolfgang Petersen would have connected the story together properly, and at least shot the violence in a convincing fashion. A brilliant director such as Paul Verhoeven would have found a way to satirise the social mores of the eighteenth century, and delivered enough convincing violence to give the MPAA fits at the same time. As much as Boll would like to pretend otherwise on the basis of sales figures in countries where they would probably not understand the abysmal dialogue anyway, he is nowhere near the league of Petersen or Verhoeven. And that is a big part of what makes his films so insulting to the general public. Boll would like us to believe that he is some kind of misunderstood genius who keeps striking out with critics because they do not understand his message. Well, Boll, the disjointed plot aside, I understand you just fine. The thing is, when I do understand your films, I do not want them anymore.So I gave BloodRayne a two out of ten. A one would only further its position on the bottom one hundred, and it is deserving of infamy in neither sense of the word. Avoid.",

After seeing a wide selection of decent horror at Fantastic Fest a few weeks ago, I expected this to have some substance because it was picked to screen at the Austin Film Festival. All I can think of is that someone must have blackmailed the programmers because it's terrible.The dailogue is either very clich\u00e9, or very stilted (and often both). There are serious continuity issues. The gratuitous sex scene was so completely sudden it seemed like an excerpt from a porn movie. The wigs are terrible, and the costuming as bad. There is no character development, and the motivations shown on screen seem more like red herrings than anything else.I can't think of anything redeeming about this film other than I didn't pay money just to see it.",

While I can't honestly say that Bloodrayne is anything special, it's certainly not the complete disaster that it's supposed to be. There's no denying that several of the main actors are woefully miscast - Michael Madsen being the prime example - and there are some bizarre and distracting cameos from Michael Pare (whom I swear hasn't aged a day in the twenty five years since Streets of Fire), Billy Zane and Meat Loaf. But I still found Bloodrayne to be considerably more entertaining than Van Helsing (2004), the film it most resembles. In fact it's only slightly inferior to the similarly themed Underworld movies.",

            "content": "I want to strike a blow for a movie that seems to be one of the worst movies, when you follow the ratings and verdicts here. But it's easy here to rate one star without watching a movie, and also without giving one thought to.Of course it isn't an artwork, a masterwork, or comparable to high budget productions a la Lord Of The Rings. Instead, it fits right into a solid line of straight-to-video productions, or some bigger TV Adventure movies, but is definitively enjoyable for people who don't expect a lifetime experience from Uwe Boll. But at least, one have to respect the genre outside the Tolkien realm. If not, the movie has no chance at all.It is a simple story about a girl that wants revenge for the killing of her mother by her father, who is the most powerful Vampire, and also wants to be ruler of the world. Kristanna Loken as Rayne does a good Job being sexy, powerful and filled with hate and blood hunger. The others are OK, and Ben Kingsley does keep a low profile, because he has not very much to do except being old Ben Kingsley. Directing is not great, I admit that, it is at max, zealous. Definitevly it is better than in any of the infamous Asylum Movies i've seen, in terms of storytelling, actors leading and so on. The only one bigger mistake is that the short history of Raynes romance with Sebastian is revealed at the end of the movie, so that the short sex scene with him looks quite unfounded.If there wouldn't be so much blood and gore, it could pass as a movie for youngsters. I remember watching such movies (of course without gore and without nudity), when I was ten or twelve.",

            "review_title": "Well... I'm surprised that I actually kind of liked it (don't kill me!)",
            "content": "Okay, I actually kind of liked this movie. Why? Well, as far as pure entertainment goes, I was actually entertained. I laughed at a lot of the acting and dialog, and the fight editing was a nightmare, but in the end, I still had a decent time with the movie. It gave me what I expected, but with some decent (and some really bad) acting.Let's start with the Ed Wood pluses, also known as the \"so bad it's good\" material. For starters, Ben Kingsley. I have never seen such an accomplished actor do such a terrible job in my life! I couldn't stop laughing whenever he was on screen. I mean, it really seemed as if it was just a wax dummy of him set on a chair. His dialog was uber flat, and I honestly think they just got a sample of his voice and had a computer read his lines. But... he made the entire movie uber campy. It just felt right. Also, there is the clunky dialog. Some of the dialog does work, namely when the characters speak in more modern dialects, but when they try to get all old English or whatever the words become clunkier than a cart with square wheels being pulled by a man with no arms and legs. Michael Madsen also phoned in his performance, but it was ten times better than the \"acting\" he did in Sin City. And by the end of the movie I had very few problems with him. He did what he had to, nothing more. So, there are the bad parts. They seem minor, but oh are they major. Namely because they are all constantly apparent. One bad part that wasn't funny was the constant shots of people riding on horses. It got old very fast.The actual good parts come in the form of a few things. For one is Michelle Rodrigez. She really, honestly tried with this movie, and came off as very credible. Her accent, her movements, everything... it just worked. She made this movie watchable. Also, the lead was very well played by Kristina Lochen (sp?). Her dialog is junk, but she can fight, and she plays the tough girl very well. And she looked the part. And Billy Zane, in a small role, is a blast to watch. He eats the cheesy dialog up, and you can tell he is enjoying himself. They should have given him more screen time! A big plus for this movie is the fact that there is actually a coherent story this time. Yes, actually story in a Bolle video game movie! It's not a great story, but it's a fleshed out, coherent story. Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead both were messes in the story department, basically moving from action scene to action scene. Here there is more time for characters to talk, interact. For any other director this movie would be a total disaster, but looking at Bolle's past video game adaptations I would have to say that he is improving in leaps and bounds. He's still not a great director, but he's getting better.The usual problems come up though. The fight scenes are horribly edited, with some very bad film speed affects being thrown in. He needs to stop doing that, because he actually gets the fight angles right. He shoots from more of a distance, allowing the audience to see the action. Sadly the editing is so off, and some of the effects so distracting, that some decent action seems incoherent and choppy.Over all, well, this movie is far from being good, but it does what it set out to do. It's actually about on par with the first Mortal Kombat movie. I am not a fan of the director by any means, but I have to say, I had no problem with this movie. I got a kick out of it. It has it's cheese value, and I knew that it would. If you go in expecting anything but pure cheese then you'll be disappointed. If you go in and plan to have a few laughs, crack a few jokes, and just enjoy the film, then you actually will have a good time with it. I know a lot of people are going to just breeze past this review, but I have to say, I have seen some REALLY bad movies, and this isn't one of them. It's got a decent plot, some good acting (and some REALLY bad acting), and it's got action.I have a feeling that the Dungeon Siege movie will suck though. It's like... three fricking hours long!

            "content": "Where to start with this one? I'll point out that i watched it only because i heard that Kristanna Loken shows her boobies here. I didn't play the game nor have i known anything about the plot from that point of view. So i'm writing this solely on the movie experience.I must point out that the movie has its good sides.Most notably Ben Kingsleys horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE wig. I couldn't stop myself to burst into laughter anytime he was on screen. Its simply hilarious and worth the admission price alone.Another good thing is the guy with the mullet (Matthew Davis). He looked almost as ridiculous as Ben Kingsley with a wig. By the way, I had no idea that mullets were that popular in 19th century Romania but the filmmakers sure proved me wrong. Maximum respect for the mullet Matthew, wear it proudly.Of course you do get to see Kristanna Lokens boobs in a raunchy, makes no sense at all, sex scene so that also is a good thing.I must point out that fight scenes, although they occur pretty rarely, are pretty rich with gore. They really surprised me there and i must say that i wasn't disappointed by that aspect of the movie. And you wont be either. Of course if you aren't into the bloody mess type of stuff the fight scenes will suck. But hey, who isn't into bloodbaths anyway? So some really good stuff there as well.Now for the not so great aspects of the movie.First of all the dialogs are completely and utterly, mind numbingly stupid. Its like a 6 year old wrote all the dialogs. The screenplay is very bad too. Think \"American Ninja 2\" in 19th century Romania when you think about the screenplay and dialogs in the movie. Really, really naive and infantile stuff there. Also they stole one ninja trick from American Ninja 2, you'll see it in one of the final scenes in the movie. I guess you could call it a homage to it though. Come to think of it, no, you couldn't. Its just plane old plagiarism.Acting sucks too. Ben Kingsley just stares in the camera with his bad wig, Kristanna Loken does a lot of moaning and thats about it. Don't expect wonders from Michael Madsen either. Billy Zane does his thing regardless of anything, so if you like his style he could be acceptable. I like it.Oh yeah, they have a MeatLoaf cameo. Now thats what i call weak. Then again, the topless babes in his scenes totally make up for his fat ass.The director Uwe Boll isn't really that bad as people say he is. He gave us blood and tits, yes. And in a pretty good way, i might add. But he delivered nothing more. Blood and tits go without saying for modern day directors anyway. So i'll point out that he sucks as well but not as much as meatloaf.Although this movie is really bad I'm not sorry i watched it. If you want watch it and if you'll appreciate the trashy aspects in the movie you wont be sorry either.I'll give this one a 4/10.",

While I agree that Uwe Boll should be making low budget videos or used car commercials until he learns how to direct, this movie was not all that bad if you overlook some of its obvious failings. The fact is, there are hundreds of low budget movies made every year that are much worse than this. Many have laughable effects, are more trite, with worse acting, sets and costumes. You can see them any evening on SciFi or the other basic cable channels.The biggest problem with Bloodrayne may be that it attempts to be more than it is. Compared to most direct-to-video fare, it's not half bad. I saw it on TV, so I'm not comparing it to other major releases from big studios. I believe people are judging it based on their expectations as much as anything.I thought Kristanna Lokken was pretty good. Fortunately, she plays the main character. She was a good choice for Rayne. Some of the other actors sounded a little silly trying to affect a vaguely European, old-timey accent, especially Madsen and Rodriguez, neither of whom seemed able to convincingly drop their notable Jersey accents.",

Afther that, she meets a fortuneteller (Geraldine Chaplin) who tells his father raped and killed her mother. Then she sets out to revenge her mother's rape by her father, Kagan ( Ben Kingsley), King of Vampires. Three vampire hunters, Sebastian (Matthew Davis), Katarin (Michelle Rodriguez) and Vladimir(Michel Madsen), from the Brimstone Society persuade her to join their cause. Meanwhile, Rayne falls in love with Sebastian and prepares her vengeance.This exciting movie displays unstopped action, thrills ride, spectacular fighting, graphic violence, and brief nudism with mild sex scene. It packs large amount of guts and gore , there's a huge body count, this one actually knocks off an immense amount, several vampires are staked bloodily in the chest, even more bitten with large dents. There's really savage decapitation, plenty of bodies ripped in scraps and half, including some of the most tears ever, that spill lots of blood . Most of vampires and humans victims are relegated to being bitten in the throat and neck. Magnificent special and visual effects as well as excellent make-up department. Bone-chilling and atmospheric musical score and colorful and dark cinematography ; furthermore spectacular production design .The motion picture is regularly directed by Uwe Boll . All four of the films he has realized that were based upon video games, House of the Dead (2003), Alone in the Dark (2005), BloodRayne (2005) and BloodRayne II: Deliverance (2007) were listed on the bottom of barrel by the reviewers. Most of the other films he's directed, including Heart of America (2002), and Blackwoods (2002) are not widely available in America, but have received similarly low ratings among those who have seen them. All technicians and some actors participate in the following : BloodRayne II with Natassia Malthe, Zack Ward and again Michel Pare, Uwe Boll's fetish's actor.

            "content": "Ok...first off, is this Ben Hur? Braveheart? Or the Ten Commandments? Nope. This in no way is on par with the greatest period movies of all time. Nor was it intended so.Second, when reading the reviews it is painfully obvious that people:\n...don't like Uwe Boll and thus could not judge the movie on its merits, or...are video game fans who had very specific expectations for this movie and again, were unable to look beyond that, or... compare this movie to some of the best and most expensive genre movies, or...just flat out picked it apart for everything it was not without looking at what it is.It's stunning to read such bad reviews on a movie that simply was not bad. As mentioned, this is not a huge mega budget period film, nor is it a faithful and true recreation of the game. It was not intended to be either, yet people continue watching and reviewing it as if it were. The fact is, not many directors would take on such a film with the budget it had and a) do any better, b) leave it as bloody and violent, or c) get the names that this film has. I don't know about you, but I love medieval (or earlier) period films and they are not made nearly as much as I would like. Why? Because they're extremely expensive to do properly. Now maybe you would rather not have one at all, opposed to getting something that is above average in nearly every regard compared to the majority of similar films released in recent years. Sure, there's always going to be (the rare) exceptions, but for the most part they are simply nowhere near as good as this. That's not to say this deserves awards, but if people insist on comparing (falsely I might add) then this is all worth noting.So...the movie. I cannot speak to its affinity toward the game, as I couldn't care less, but as a story, it's fine. It's rather cookie cutter, straight out of the earlier sword and sandal films or other medieval supernatural films, or for that matter, any period vampire movie or even newer vamp movie. Surprisingly, I haven't heard a single comparison to the Resident Evil or Underworld franchises, which surprises me. But I digress.The production is on par with the budget it was given. Period. There are some high points and some not so high points, but the pace is swift and keeps the characters moving toward their ultimate goals. The acting is average, at best, and could be better, especially considering the number of \"seasoned\" actors in the cast. It certainly wasn't as \"piss poor and awful\" as others suggest. Good? Maybe not quite, but awful? Nope.Special fx are decent, though done in a manner that leaves little to linger on screen for more than a brief flash. Costumes and sets were enjoyable to look at. Some beautiful camerawork on the large-scale sweeping panoramas, and the lighting is equally as well done.All in all, this is a very avaerage flick, with some above average sequences and a few below average sequences. Anybody who reviews it as poorly as many have, are hating purely for reasons outside the boundaries of the movie itself.Notes on parental content:\nnot much in the way of profanity. Mild at best.there are a couple scenes of a sexual nature, including one with full frontal female nudity and multiple with topless female nudity. The protagonist wears an outfit with bare midriff and cleavafe, as do a couple other female characters. Nudity and sexual content is not over the top or a large part of the movie, but there are incidents of both.intense and/or frightening scenes...I dunno. This terribly subjective. To me, nothing about this movie was intense or scary, but there is certainly a dark overtone which purveys throughout, and there are scenes of vampire attacks and/or fighting.violence and/or gore is fairly prominent from start to finish. Many reviews, including remarks in the Parental Content section state that this is an \"extremely gory film.\" This too is subjective, as I would not consider this anywhere near an \"extremely gory film.\" There is a large amount of bloodshed whether by combat or vampire bite, but only a couple quick shots that would be considered gory. Regardless, it is a violent film, with a fair amount of blood, so all potential first time viewers should be aware of that.I dunno folks...Bloodrayne is certainly not going to win any awards, but I felt it very entertaining, honestly...from start to finish. Not sure that I would buy the film either, but I could easily watch it again down the road a piece.My advice is to watch it for what it is - a loosely based interpretation on a video game franchise; and I do mean loosely. Enjoy the costumes, the action (of which some is actually good), and the general storyline that involves castles & vampires. There just aren't that many watchable flicks with this byline.",

            "content": "After watching BloodRayne, I am thoroughly convinced Uwe Boll will eventually make a good and entertaining movie (five years from now at the very very least.) As Alone in the Dark was a step up from House of the Dead, BloodRayne is a step up from Alone in the dark. Unfortunately, before he gets there Boll will have to continue to trek through the vast expanse of mediocrity one baby step at a time, and there is far more entertainment from a shamelessly bad movie than a merely mediocre one.The opening credits take place over a nice little montage of paintings, then moves to a sunset in the mountains effectively establishing the mood in a surprisingly competent fashion. I found myself entertaining the idea, \"You know, maybe \u0085 just maybe Boll finally made a good movie.\" Then just like Alone in the Dark, the first actor opened his mouth and my hopes collapsed. I shook my head, sighed, then braced myself to endure another 80 minutes of performances downplayed to the point that they lack conviction. Vladimir (Michael Madsen), the seasoned vampire hunter and head of Brimstone, delivers his lines with a tone that implies he's been around and seen everything. As a free bonus, Madsen adds an additional quality: unenthusiastic boredom.Kagun (Ben Kingsley) the old powerful vampire lord, having achieved demi-God status amongst mortals, spends most of his time sitting, standing, or walking. He takes action only in the ceremonial sense. Played to perfection by Kingsley who goes so far as to make his own appearance in the film seem equally ceremonial and equally inconsequential.(Although one has to wonder if Kingsley and Madsen both went overboard in their performances, or if the editing pushed the performances over the threshold. Dwell on that for a moment, but don't answer.) Domastir (Will Sanderson), Kaguns' henchman, forever has a crazed wide-eyed stare that lacked any sense of menace. It reminded me of that look pro wrestler gives during their pre-match smack talk rants (which I, try as I might, can't watch with a straight face) ,and from hence forth I saw Domastir as the little wrestler who couldn't.As for Rayne, herself, Kristanna Loken does an admirable job of wanting to go somewhere with the role despite being trapped by a film that's lost. It knows where it wants to go, but doesn't know how to get there. She does what she can to explore the bloodlust and turmoil of vampirism (or dhampirism) even though the film she's starring in cares only enough to explore blood, blood, and more blood (a point hammered home by the final overly-long montage at the end.) And then Billy Zane, Elrich, comes to the rescue. Zane salvages his role by going in the exact opposite direction as the rest of the cast. He opts for an approach reminiscent of his role in Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight, and gives two well timed blasts from the defibrillator to counter the rest of the film floating on tharzine.More interesting, yet, is the scene with Elrich and Domastir face to face. When Domastir has a sword to Elrich's heart, staring as intently as ever like a crazed man obsessed with reading a name tag, Elrich pushes the lil' wrestler wanna-be's sword aside and dismisses the whole encounter like it was part of his Las Vegas illusionist's show where Domastir is hypnotized. Elrich and everyone in the audiences knows it's a joke, but Domastir remains clueless.Gallons of gratuitous gore splatters the death sequences in direct answer to the growing number of PG13 films that should shoot for a hard R but sadly whore themselves to younger audiences. It's a nice thought, but it comes across as gore for the sole sake of gratuity to the point of goofiness. A direct contrast to BloodRayne's overly grounded (\"grounded\" as in six-feet under) performances. Yet another indication, that Billy Zane had the right idea.Budgetary and time constraints show up in the choreography of the fights and battle scenes, and even more so in the editing of said scenes. The fights seem curiously rehearsed like a stage-dance, and the swords (practice weapons aside) have unusually thick edges. Fair game for criticism? Eh, in places, sure. No doubt, though, that Boll bashers will target anything and everything not up to Lord of the Rings standards.In my Alone in the Dark review I mainly focused my criticism on Boll's parasitic dependency on better films for material in his own to the point that Alone in the Dark cannot stand on its own without Equilibrium, Evil Dead, and the Matrix. BloodRayne is like a baby's first step, reluctantly letting go and making an unstable effort to walk \u0096 letting go of the blatant rip offs (\"homages\" on steroids) and finding its own style.Uwe Boll's not there yet, but he's getting there \u0085 one step at a time.",

The locations and cinematography in Romania are magnificent and I believe it would be impossible to build sets so spectaculars in another country; the cast is excellent, with Sir Ben Kingsley, Geraldine Chaplin, Michael Madsen, Michelle Rodriguez, Matthew Davis and the gorgeous Kristanna Loken; the story is full of action and the characters are very well developed. I have glanced many silly comments, but the winner is one that states that \"Kristanna Loken looks like a child instead of a woman\". Wow, this athletic actress is one of the most beautiful women of the cinema industry. Definitely this movie be included in Bottom 100 is one of the greatest absurd I have ever seen in IMDb.

I remember being excited more for the fact that Uwe Boll was in attendance so I could hear what he had to say about film-making.Well, let's say his comments before and after the movie are revelations as to why he makes such crappy films. First off, he can't grasp why people savage his movies so much. He feels that the internet community gives him a hard time because he's German and he makes his movies with Nazi money (his quote, not mine. Of course, he was joking, right?) Secondly, he couldn't care less if the actors he has are right for the roles. In fact, finding actors is his last thing he does to secure financing for his films. Apparently, he thinks the story is strong enough to carry the film. So, this is why we end up with actors like Ben Kinglsey working alongside Michael Madsen. Really, the only thing they had was the time to do the movie and the earning of a paycheck. So, if this doesn't strike you as soulless film-making, I don't know what does. In essence, by waiting until the last possible moment to hire actors, he can make his movies with a secured budget.Th reason why I write this is because I heard his new \"epic\" In the Name of the King will be a four hour film split in half like Kill Bill. This depressed me to no end. Uwe Boll really is the next Ed Wood, even though Ed Wood cared about his actors and films.",

Bloodrayne also has some real 'declined' good actors. The storyline is as always the same but what makes this movie hateful or adorable is the amount of gore in it. And as I watched closely I noticed that Olaf Ittenbach was involved. The master of gore himself. Some killings or slaughterings are not for the squeamish and that's the main reason that people are hating this flick. But if you love vampires and gore than your in for a good flick, I just can't believe that it has a 2,4 on the scale. That was also one of the reasons that I never watched it earlier but it was one of those days that you feel you have to give it a try. I was not disappointed.

Much of what I found disappointing in the movie did not have to do with the director, but with things that may have been \"out of their hands.\" Ben Kingsley's performance felt completely uninspired. He may as well have been reading a cue card without punctuation marks. Michael Madsen felt somewhat out of place, but his portrayal as Vladimir was acceptable. Michelle Rodriguez, well, I just love her work. And Kristanna Loken did a very good job as Rayne. She seemed to actually care about the character. It may not have been an Oscar-winning performance, but she still played the killer with a heart believably (which, unfortunately, is not really who Bloodrayne is in the video games, but is acceptable for the sake of the script.) The script did seem weak at some points, and could have tied up a couple of loose ends, but overall it served it's purpose. For being a video game movie, it may not have been as good as \"Doom,\" but it greatly surpassed what had become the norm with movies like \"Street Fighter\" and \"Double Dragon.\" Finally, I must speak about the director. I did sit through part of \"House of the Dead\" and simply could not bear it, though I really didn't give it half a chance. I expected a similar experience with Bloodrayne. Well, Uwe Boll, you have surprised me. His choice of camera angles and shots were interesting and had dramatic effect. He really does want to make a good movie. His efforts show through. I left the theater feeling pleased. There was some heart underneath this film. I am actually looking forward to his Dungeon Siege film, which was in the trailers.So to recap, was it a great movie? No. Will it win awards? No. Was it enjoyable? Definitely. Would I watch it again? I don't doubt it. Perhaps in the end, it felt like a really good B-movie.

As well as seeing whether one of the worst directors of all time Uwe Boll was capable of making a good film. On top of that, like Ben Kingsley a lot as an actor and he is reason enough to see anything he's involved in. Did not have my hopes up, because even looking at the advertising and trailers 'Bloodrayne' looked awful.The terrible reputation and dubious advertising do not lie. 'Bloodrayne' to me and many others really is that bad, bad actually is an understatement. Have come to the conclusion that Boll is incapable of making a halfway decent film, have not seen everything of his but all that has been seen has been terrible and as bad as their reputation. As someone who is usually very generous rating and reviewing films, 'Bloodrayne' does stand out as one of the worst films seen recently and actually full stop. Everything is abysmally executed and there are no redeeming qualities at all, have said that about very few films seen recently.'Bloodrayne' couldn't be more inept visually. Photography that is both chaotic and static, bacon-slicer-like editing, drab costumes that don't fit the setting, continuity errors galore (more than anybody can count), afterthought-like visual effects, lighting completely lacking in atmosphere, those can all be found. The music sounds cheap and is never dynamic with anything on screen, often working against it and like it belonged in another film entirely.Writing is horrendously stilted and cheesy, enough to make one want to vomit and the unintentional camp later on becomes exhausting. The action has no momentum or excitement whatsoever, is chaotically edited, under-rehearsed choreographically and a lot of it is incomprehensible. It really takes ineptitude to a whole new level. As is the story, it never comes to life and is not easy to follow often. Boll's direction is typically non-existent and cold, comparing him to Ed Wood is rather insulting when although Wood's films were the complete opposite of fine heart one could see that he had his heart in the right place (something that has never been the case with Boll). The characters are walking cliches that are neither interesting or worth rooting for, instead bland and irritating.You know something is wrong when the best performance comes from an angry-looking Michelle Rodriguez. Elsewhere there is an emotionless lead, Meat Loaf's uncomfortable cameo and Michael Madsen and Billy Zane going through the motions. Worst of it is Kingsley in his worst ever performance, taking hamminess and chewing-scenery-to-pieces to mind-boggling extremes.Summarising, completely bloodless and appallingly awful. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "BloodRayne is set in 18th Century Romania where a half Vampire & half human known as a Dhampir named Rayne (Kristanna Locken) is an exhibit in a side-show carnival as a freak, she remembers how a powerful Vampire called Kagan (Ben Kingsley) raped her human mother to create her & then murdered her when she was still a young girl. Rayne wants revenge & after escaping the carnival sets about finding an eye, an eye that belonged to a Vampire who had all the strengths of a Vampire but none of the weaknesses. If the eye along with his heart & rib which are also hidden were to be assimilated it could create a new super race of near invincible Vampires that would take over the world. Along the way Rayne teams up with some Vampire hunters from a secret society known as Brimstone who also want to stop Kagan & see him dead...This German American co-production was co-produced & directed by Uwe Boll who has already gained an unwanted reputation as a bad filmmaker so it's no real surprise that BloodRayne seems just about one of the most hated films ever. I have read many comments here on the IMDb about BloodRayne & the one thing that they almost all have in common is they're attacks on Boll as a director, I see very little in these comments as to suggest why BloodRayne is a bad film other than Uwe Boll directed it. I sometimes wonder what people's criteria is for judging a film & BloodRayne is such a case in point, I'm sorry but I actually thought it was a fairly enjoyable if ultimately forgettable fantasy/action/horror film & for that I apologise to no-one. I just can't see what it is about BloodRayne that people hate so much, I just can't. The script by Guinevere Turner was based on the Atari video game BloodRayne (2002) which I freely admit I haven't played & have absolutely no idea what it is about, as far as video game adaptations go I actually thought BloodRayne is one of the better attempts & I certainly enjoyed it more than Street Fighter (1994) & Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001). At a little over 90 minutes the film moves along at a reasonable pace, there's plenty of gory action set-pieces & on a dumb sort of level I was entertained by it. However the character's are really poor, they are given silly sounding names & as such it's sometimes hard to relate to people & the dialogue could have been better but then again maybe this is how people spoke in 18th Century Romania, you never know. The story is functional & your typical Dungeons & Dragons fare with some evil guy needing some artifact or item which will allow him to have all sorts of evil unlimited powers, the narrative isn't the best as the film awkwardly & sometimes seemingly randomly goes from one fight to another with little reason.Credit where credit is due & one has to say that BloodRayne looks really nice & very polished, in fact I'd say BloodRayne looks splendid. There is some wonderful looking scenery & plenty of sweeping aerial shots across the vast landscapes which give the film real scope & a certain expansive feel. The production design is top notch as well with some magnificent Gothic style castles, dungeons, caves & villages which all add to the atmosphere. I thought BloodRayne was a very visually impressive film & that has to be in part down to Boll who is regarded by many it seems as the worst director ever. I sat down & watched BloodRayne knowing it's bad reputation & I specifically looked out for anything that would support that reputation but I really couldn't see anything, apart from a slightly underdeveloped & forgettable story I thought it was pretty good. There's some good special effects here as well with plenty of well choreographed fights & battles which contain pleasing amounts of spurting blood & slashed throats.With a supposed budget of about $25,000,000 one has to say BloodRayne looks very nice with quite an epic feel to it, the production design, music, cinematography & special effects are also well above average. Shot in Bucharest & Transylvania in Romania. There's a pretty impressive cast here including Kristanna Locken (looking sexy in tight leather), Michael Madsen, Udo Kier, Meat Loaf in a wig surrounded by naked Romanian prostitutes (hey, it's nice work if you can get it... right Mr. Loaf?), Michael Pare, Billy Zane, Michelle Rodriguez & the Oscar winning Sir Ben Kingsley no less. Unfortunately most of them seem to be there for the money & the performances aren't great.BloodRayne by all accounts is the worst film ever if you believe what you read, well I can assure you now it's nowhere near the worst film ever made. I must say the flimsy story & poor character's meant my interest did start to wain but the action, the gore & the nice visuals kept me watching until the end. A lot of people say it's the worst film ever, with no good reason to back it up I might add, so maybe I'm in the minority for liking it. Followed by BloodRayne II: Deliverance (2007) & BloodRayne 3 (2009).",

            "review_title": "Bloodrayne is by far Bolls Best feature...but that isn't saying much.",
            "content": "Bloodrayne is a film that is shockingly competent. On almost every level the film is\u0085competent. For the first fifteen minutes my jaw was on the floor. This film had wall-to-wall competence. Then things stopped making sense, the action picked up and the film felt like it had skipped a reel. And I remembered I was watching a film by Dr. Uwe Boll. And whatever his strengths may be\u0085coherence of plot is most assuredly not one of them.The film tells the story\u0085er\u0085tries to tell the story of Rayne, a half vampire who isn't like Blade, because she has big breasts, and her battles with Ben Kingsley, who might be her father. He apparently made regular house calls to rape Rayne's mother, probably to punish her for naming her daughter something stupid like Rayne.Ben Kingsley, playing a bored guy in it for the paycheck/vampire overlord, is afraid of Rayne because of some prophecy that is never revealed to the audience. Rayne hates him because he raped her mother and\u0085well, the plot's mechanics call for her to hate him. Everyone hates Kingsley's character because he's some evil guy, but I didn't see him do anything even remotely mean to anyone except Rayne. He just looked like some sad old guy with a huge nose, which isn't exactly what I think of when I picture evil.The story starts with Rayne as a circus freak, drinking the blood of goats. One night, someone sneaks into her cage to rape her in her sleep. (Rape is apparently Dr. Boll's second favorite plot device next to prophecies.) Luckily, she has an empty bottle of liquor to kill the guy with. After killing the would be rapist and sucking his blood Rayne goes crazy, killing everyone in sight, including her best friend, and all of this is told completely out or order, Tarantino style for no discernible reason. Wisely, the temporal shift gimmick is completely abandoned after the 20 minute mark.Meanwhile, Michael Madsen, Michelle Rodriguez and Matthew Davis are stalking the countryside looking for Rayne\u0085because\u0085well, I guess that prophecy. Billy Zane, playing a guy wearing a dead skunk as a toupee, is Rodriquez's father (which is beyond absurd as they couldn't look more dissimilar) who works for Kingsley or, maybe not. It doesn't really matter because he is only in the movie as a plot device to play Judas and speed up the action in the third act anyway. Rayne and the three musketeers meet up and form a quartet before joining an army and going on a Rocky style training bend. (Everything is imminent until Rayne has to have training scenes, and then they have weeks to dawdle away). Rodriguez hates Rayne for some reason and Davis arbitrarily gives her some loving after revealing that his parents were vampires. Then they all go on a quest.Much of this movie relies on characters following psychic premonitions which they have no foreshadowing or basis for or following prophecies that are never clearly explained to the viewer. In that sense it is very much like a video game where, during the loading screen, you are told your level objectives. Rayne feels like the outline to a video game itself rather than an expansion of one. A psychic tells Rayne of three oracles (the aforementioned quest) taken from an ultimate vampire, that for some reason give the owner of said objects magical powers. So, Rayne goes on a mini-game style quest to find each one of the three oracles. but\u0085she only finds two, and they don't seem to actually do anything for her. More confounding is that these oracles are parts of an ancient vampire's body and could, according to yet another prophecy, allow their bearer to control the world. But for some reason, no one questions that this original vampire was killed and dismembered, making these pieces not that intimidating.There are even scenes that feel like boss fights. In a monks' temple there is an ogre underground that Rayne must fight and kill to get the key to open a door that reveals\u0085a jump puzzle that Rayne must complete in order to get to one of the mystical objects.The acting is all pretty bad. Aside from a hilarious 10 minute scene where Meat Loaf Aday shows up and throws some much needed enthusiasm into the film with a character that looks like Beethoven and acts like Syd Barrett sadly, he is quickly dispatched. Michelle Rodriguez is hilariously awful as the brooding angry chick who's in it for the money, while Michael Madsen plays the older, wiser, drunker warrior with a cool voice, who is in it for the money. Billy Zane over acts enough to make it physically painful for me to watch him, and Ben Kingsley's performance made me feel like he had taken a few Quaaludes before each take.Kristanna Loken is passable as Rayne. Her accent comes and goes, but so does everyone else's, and she looks very pretty. She also does a nude scene, which aside from its obvious interest piquing also doubles as the funniest bit of soft-core porn this side of the Toxic Avenger.the movie has some above average gore and CGI effects. There is nothing here as awful as the monsters in Alone in the Dark and the effect shots are pretty well integrated. It's not amazing, but it is impressive considering the film's pedigree. Annoyingly, these gore shots are inserted with no context in the middle of fight scenes where you have absolutely no idea what is going on. The angles were so overly close that most action scenes were just disorienting. And when there were wide angles, they were poorly framed, or worse yet, shot at 16 frames a second during the finale.It's leaps and bounds better than his past work, but it's just depressingly average in its best moments.",

Not an easy task, mind you; after the steaming piles that were \"Alone in the Dark\" and \"House of the Dead\", not to mention the trailer for the movie I was about to be subjected to, I had come to associate Uwe Boll's name with everything I hate about Hollywood and the trash they churn out on a weekly basis. Even then, I was unprepared.Deviating tremendously from the source \"material\" (which wasn't inspiring in and of itself), Bloodrayne follows cosplay-wannabe Rayne as she hunts down Ben Kingsley's \"Kagan\", lord of the vampires. Whereas I've been a fan of Kingsley since \"Sneakers\", but his performance in this film is about as intriguing as watching paint dry. Michael Madsen looks like he's about to yawn in almost every scene (probably bored to tears). Kristanna Loken, besides being grossly miscast, couldn't act her way out of a paper bag...someone save this girl, please! Only Michelle Rodriguez could be considered even tolerable, but her performance is nowhere even close to on par as it was in \"Resident Evil\".Awkward dialogue, terrible camera work, poorly choreographed fight scenes (were they even choreographed at all?), sex for the sake of sex, and a plot so simple it seemed possible to screw up (and yet he did), Boll once again proves his directorial ineptitude. This guy couldn't direct traffic if he wanted to, as proved (once again) by this train wreck of a film.",

And although I liked it alright, it really is one of those movies chock full of \"well that's good but\" features.If you like vampire movies of the modern, campy, pop type ... think of Vampire Lestrat, and Blade, and even Buffy the Vampire Killer ... then this move may appeal. I've liked Vampire movies and stories since childhood and although I prefer \"old school\" vampires (like Dracula) I do think the modern ones of this kind have a kind of cool appeal as well.The cast includes some enormously capable actors: Ben Kingsley, Michael Madden, Michelle Rodriguez. They, and the entire cast, produced solid performances fitting their parts and the overall script ... but certainly nothing here really stretched their talents. The female lead, Kristianna Loken, is new to me, but she's an attractive actress and turned in a solid performance.The sound and cinematography seemed to have some problems of a technical nature. Some of the speech was obscured or sounded hollow; some of the camera slides were uneven.Some of the scenes in the countryside were simply breathtaking. In fact, the whole flavor of horseback riding across these panoramic, wild, lush countrysides ... during daylight, during nighttime, during twilight ... all of this I liked very much indeed. Likewise I liked the castle(s), the monastery, the (fighting) monks, the boat that bore our heroes and heroines across the water ... these were all just delightfully lush, evocative ... the kind of scenes that just delight the heart of an old Medievalist like me. And the kinds of scenes that will thrill you as well if you like me are a Lord of the Rigns fan.The general plot ... well ... is \"OK\" ... but this is the kind of movie that for myself I have a hard time caring about the Plot. The value of a Plot in some stories and movies to me is really just to provide a framework on which to depict wonderful moods and atmospherics and scenery and the delightful playing out of Myth of the Vampire. For this purpose the plot sufficed well.There were several places during the action, though, in which the events were simply unconvincing. I won't give them away. And in a sort of high mythos or high legend movie like this, I'm certainly not in the least concerned with \"realism.\" But everything that happens should surely be convincingly in accord with the movie's internal logic. Several parts failed this test though.All in all, a good rich campy vampire flick. Not bad for an evening's entertainment. But you know ... I can't help but wonder if something with the scale and quality of the Lord of the Rings or the Chroniclkes of Narnia or even Harry Potter could be developed out of the rich, decaying, earthy mythos of the Vampire? If so that's a movie I'd love to see! Till then, though, hey: BloodRayne is a decent, fun vampire flick.",

            "content": "Uwe Boll is the most hated man in Hollywood it would seem. He has an outpouring of rage towards him and perhaps that's just everyone's love and respect for video games. I don't think the man much cares and no matter how much we complain he WILL NOT stop making movies. I have now seen all three (to date) of his video game to movie translations and here is my opinion as unpopular as it may be. They indeed ARE getting better...not a lot, and I'm not saying they're masterpieces, I'm saying in seeing Bloodrayne I didn't feel I was completely lost or wasting my time. House of The Dead was just utter crap, gorefest but crap. Alone In The Dark was campy as hell, with poor acting and a worse storyline but still better than House of The Dead and now comes Bloodrayne. I honestly Boll just doesn't care about anything. This is like his hobbie and I don't know what he's done to gain such influence over budget and actors but he has it. I think Uwe Boll is probably a video game fanatic who likes to make movies...no matter how amateurish and for whatever reason has bucket loads of money so he just doesn't care period.Now for Bloodrayne which to date is his best video game work which still leaves some inkling of hope for Far Cry. Bloodrayne does have redeemable qualities amidst some very bad moves. First off...how in the world did he get this cast?? Michelle Rodriguez, Michael Madsen, Billy Zane, and the piece de resistance....Sir (multiple Academy Award winning actor) Ben Kingsley. Granted Kingsley literally looks like he's being held against his will throughout the entire film so that could explain something. Kristanna Loken is the lead actress in the film, she plays Rayne, the half human, half vampire bent on revenge against her Vampiric father who murdered her mother. Loken looks the part without a doubt but that isn't enough. Neither is the eye candy she brings to the role and she does look great. Unfortunately her performance STINKS!! She's boring and her stunts whether her fault or not are shot in such a way where it never actually shows her doing anything. She has these great blades on her arms and we hardly ever see them get used. When she goes into action the shots pan away from her doing martial arts. The film is barely actually about Rayne and most of the time she seems to be getting her butt kicked. Michael Madsen is redeemable as Vladimir, the leader of a vampire-hunter revolution who finds Rayne in order to help them defeat the Vampires. He's a little ho-hum at times but that seems to be his style and his fight scenes are better than Loken's. Matthew Davis as Rayne's lover and Vladimir's right hand is okay but underused. He's just kind of there. Michelle Rodriguez is okay as well playing Katarin, the double crossing vampire hunter who has the best of the fight scenes with Rayne. In fact in the whole film Rodriguez's character and Loken's character have the best chemistry and some of the best fight scenes. Ben Kingsley...well he's a great actor and in some respects this is no different. His performance as the master of all the vampires Kagan is creepy, and well done considering the pace and set up for Kagan. He's a breath of fresh air in such a campy film.The script for Bloodrayne is just downright god awful. I mean the story is better than any of Boll's previous video game interpretations but the fake English accents and the campy scenes are just terribly laughable and just when you think you see a glimmer of hope (such as when Vladimir is training Rayne) you get slapped in the face with some horrible scene that makes no sense. Everyone acts as though they don't wanna be there except Loken who acts like she thinks she can act. Nonetheless for true video game fanatics it's not THAT BAD!!! There is far worse out there believe me. If anyone but Uwe Boll had directed this it wouldn't be garnishing such harsh attention. People would say it kinda sucked and that would be the end of it. Someday...many years down the road...Boll's video game films will be black market classic. It's true!! Bloodrayne is the first one I've seen of his that would be worth sitting through again so that's saying something. The story is good, the setting is beautiful, well filmed in none other than Transylvania. There are some gory, blood soaked special effects and a pretty hot sex scene against some jail bars. So don't tell me there is nothing redeemable because there is. Just not enough to make it popular. Keep em coming Boll, cause people will keep watching!! 7/10",

This movie is nothing to write home about however- if it catches you in the right mood it can be OK and watchable. If you find the lead as sexy as I did just watching her walk around is pretty cool, although it appeared she put on about 10 pounds by the end of the movie, when she changed costumes. She was still smokin hot throughout the entire film.Downsides? There's plenty!- there is NO acting to speak of this movie- looks like everyone went to the George Lucas school of wooden line delivery in this one- ESPECIALLY the older leader of the vampire fighters- I couldn't decide what to spend more time being in shock of - his horrible wig that looked like a french poodle humping his head or his lines delivered as if he was on some heavy medication reading his lines from a teleprompter- seeing them for the first time in his life.I already knew this movie sucked when I went to see it- but then I fell in love with the lead- she's so yummy she can make this dead dog limp home and the sex scene is worth the price of admission although it was WAY too short. Lots and lots of hardcore gratuitous sex with the lead of this movie could have made this movie a cult classic for generations.. too bad they didn't put that feature in here.. hahah.Anyways if you watch this with the understanding that it will be like watching a good XENA episode you won't be let down very much and be able to enjoy yourself. This is not a professional quality theatrical release- it's more like a made for TV in a lot of areas.. except that sex scene.. woo hoo!Here's hoping this actress finds some better roles for her fine ass.PLOT: A half-vampire redheaded hottie is tracking down her vampire dad to kick his ass for killing her mother. Along the way she befriends some other vampire hunters and off we go on a mission of high body count vampire killing. Watching the lead is worth the price of admission cuz.. she's hot dude.",

The reason that a lot of people push and go out of their way to say that movies such as this suck are because they would rather the film have a large muscle bound man without a shirt as the star, than an attractive woman. I think that those people are very sexist. It is true that this movie had a terrible script and dialogue. However, that isn't because of director Uwe Boll, or actress Kristanna Loken at all. Those factors point directly to the writer Guinevere Turner.The customs were very accurate to the game. Except for Kristanna Loken's hair\u0085 which wasn't red enough and appeared blonde in some scenes... but that would be because of the makeup artist not Kristanna. The fighting was magnificently sequenced and looked realistic. Now if you do want to point and say an actor did bad like everyone keeps doing, than you can point at Matthew Davis whom looked as though he were smiling even at the most odd moments.If you like pointless action packed films, with a lot of blood, and you don't mind a female star, than this movie is right down your alleyway. But if you want storyline from this you might as well read a bunch of fortune cookies, because that is all that you'll get here. Heck I have crapped better scripts than Guinevere Turner, she slaughtered what was a great and enjoyable video game. People don't listen to what these sexist bastards are saying. Use your own judgment without using other peoples judgment.

One was that I am on a circus kick and I heard this story begins at a circus. Its often the case that what follows in the body of the movie is implied to be the show you see beginning in the tent. Not so here.Also, I knew that the girl was apt. Whoever she is, her job is to wear the costume attractively and convey that adolescent notion of untapped, uncontrolled power, a mix of perversion, curse, sex and active destruction. They got this part right enough and our character wears her clothes better than Kate, Milla or Charlise, Angela or the other ones. Its not easy, I suppose, to get this right. She's redhead as required.But the main draw was the writer. We can pretend otherwise, but movies are art and often the artist that matters is the writer. That's so in this case, where everyone else seems to be an amateur, busying themselves around the very solid forward movement of what our writer wants to do.And it isn't about making good movies, or even smart ones. It is about constructing a public personality for herself to inhabit. I'm all for it. The woman in question here is Guinevere Turner.She's written, directed and acted, working out of New York. She wants to be outrageous, a sort of Hedwig. She's lesbian and challengingly so; one of her early projects was \"Go Fish,\" a personal, rather effective little movie about lesbian dating.Since then its been deliberately edgy and publicly so, including the psycho and Bettie Page projects. If you take it all, its an attractive outline. Sure, I know it is a fabricated life, that she is writing a life first and populating it with characters her character creates.But there's a path, a line of sight through it all that she allows into herself.

First, it's a based on a videogame and these sorts of things are notoriously awful. Think about it...what GOOD videogame movies can you think of off the top of your head?! But bad ones....\"Super Mario Brothers\" and \"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation\" probably come to mind. So, it's not surprising that \"BloodRayne\" is now #27 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list. And, if neither of these convince you it's crap...it was directed by Uwe Boll. Boll has made a career out of making crappy films about videogames, with such classics as \"Far Cry\", \"Alone in the Dark\" and \"House of the Dead\" to his credits. Surely, the man can take the barest of plots and convert them into long, bloated films!The film begins with a vampire woman being held like an animal at some sort of freak show where she is tormented. Eventually, however, she escapes and, inexplicably, joins up with a group of vampire slayers(???) to kill the man who apparently raped and killed her mother long ago. Vampires teaming up with vampire slayers?! That's like expecting Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi to team up for a buddy picture!! They explain that BloodRayne is different...she is a vampire who lives to kill vampires! That's because she's a half-vampire! If this sort of thing makes no sense, don't blame this film...vampire lore is constantly changing these days. Try reading a few recent vampire novels and you'll see what I mean....as now, many can go out in daylight, some are born vampires, some sparkle, BloodRayne can wear a crucifix and much more.So is this any good? Well, it looks nice...and this isn't surprising because Boll loves to spend money to make big and nice looking films. Also, it has a few respectable actors in it...another Boll touch. Michael Madsen, Ben Kingsley and Geraldine Chaplin both prove that with enough money, an actor with a good reputation is willing to undermine it a bit. As for Meatloaf....well...Mr. Loaf is in the film as well.So why all the hate...as well as the abysmal current score of 2.9? Well, much of it is because there is so much fighting...it is numbing. Another issue is the dialog, which at times is pretty limp. I think it's also a bit dull and not fun to watch. But, I would argue that there at least are worse videogame-based films. It's not as bad as \"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation\" nor \"Super Mario Brothers\"....hardly a glowing endorsement, but it wasn't quite as bad as I'd anticipated. I think much of it's low score is because the film lost so much money AND because Boll's name is pretty much synonymous with the word 'sucks'.",

Nevertheless, she is no match for the babes from the UNDERWORLD and RESIDENT EVIL series. Hell, she isn't even up to the likes of Charlize Theron as Aeon Flux, a role equally worthy of a Razzie if ever there was one. You know how bad a movie truly is when someone like David Warner or Jeremy Irons or Ben Kingsley turns up as the movie's cardboard villain. Kingsley wins the honors here. He is ludicrous, and seems to know it. He mostly stands around and emits great pauses between snatches of horribly inane dialog. Kingsley has taken on several very bad roles over the years, and I think this one tops all others. Plus Michael Madsen as a vampire hunter mumbles and stumbles his way through yet another Z-grade production. So what's left? The battle scenes are clumsily staged. The gore is pretty standard.

Boll outdoes himself with constantly out of place camera angles and really unexciting action scenes. He's not called the modern day Ed Wood for nothing.The actors: This is the biggest and most talented cast Boll has managed to bribe into one of his films so far. Michael Madsen, Udo Kier, Ben Kingsley and Kristanna Loken are just some of the people who have been hired to humiliate themselves this time. Madsen tries but he really only puts as much effort into his role as the script deserves - meaning, not very much. Udo Kier does his best comical evil-Russian-mind-controller \u00e1 la \"Yuri's Revenge\" impression - too bad the film actually tries to be serious. Ben Kingsley is so monotonous it's clear he has nothing but contempt for the film - but what intelligent actor wouldn't? Loken... well, Loken looks good and acts bad, although I didn't expect much else. Some of the supporting actors are so unbelievably awful you don't know whether to laugh or cry.The story: Not even worth mentioning. So I won't.The musical score: Generic and overbearing, loud and completely out of sync with the scenes most of the time. Slapped on to the film by Boll not to enhance the film but because films are supposed to have one.The effects: Very funny in an over-the-top kind of way, but certainly not scary. The guy who gets split in half is a laugh riot.The film's main problem is that for all its idiotic dialogue and laughable acting it simply isn't entertaining enough. It's one of the dullest movies I've watched in a long time and before the 1 hour mark I guarantee you that you'll be bored halfway into a coma. Oh, and could the nonsensical, out of place sex scene be any *less* erotic, because I don't think I was quite bored enough at this point! In conclusion: It's truly \"worthy\" of being in the Bottom 100. How fitting that the first vampire movie Boll makes is the one that sucks the most. My next stop in this marathon is the 1990 superhero movie \"Captain America\". Pray for my sanity.",

            "content": "Curious about the man often referred to as the modern day Edward Wood Jr., my friends and I decided to watch our first Uwe Boll movie. Unfortunately, the only one I could get for a dollar was BloodRayne II, and one of my friends objected to watching a sequel without having seen the original, so he went to Blockbuster to rent the first one. Three hours of incompetence is far too much, as you must imagine. The first one doesn't, in fact, rank as one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's poor, to be sure, but there was enough cleavage and gory violence to keep at least the juvenile part of my mind (a huge part of my total mind, to be perfectly honest!) engaged. BloodRayne is a Medieval action movie about a half vampire gal (Kristen Loken, from Terminator 3) looking to kill her father (Ben Kingsley), the vampire ruler who raped and killed her mother. She joins up with a secret society whose purpose it is to exterminate vampires (led by Michael Madsen, Matt Davis and Michelle Rodriguez). Also in this far too accomplished cast are Billy Zane, Udo Kier, Geraldine Chaplin and Meat Loaf (credited as \"Meatloaf Aday\"). As with most of Uwe Boll's movies, this one is based on a video game. But apparently he or the studio or the screenwriter or whoever decided that the game's fans, the only ones who would probably be interested in seeing the movie anyway, weren't worth pleasing, because the games take place in like the 1940s or something (the little bit I saw of it had cars, anyway), and this one takes place in Medieval times, I guess because the time period is hot or something because of the Lord of the Rings movies. The whole movie seems lazy. The look on every actor's face is that one that says, \"Give me my paycheck!\" Sometimes they attempt a British-sounding accent, but that comes and goes. It doesn't look at all like the film had an action choreographer. The violence during the action sequences is delightfully nasty. If you can giggle at poorly done decapitations and dismemberment, those parts of the movie are moderately fun. But much of the film just has the characters standing around talking, and it gets really boring.",

            "content": "Another vampire movie has just come out. \"Bloodrayne\" is as bloody as its namesake. Here you have a woman named Rayne(Kristanna Loken) as a sultry but lethal dhampir who kills anyone who crosses her. Even a vampire is the victim of her wrath. She is trusting among some people, but many dread the undead. Don't we all? Unless they fight back, the humans have Rayne on her side. Vladamir(Michael Madsen,\"Species1&2\"), Sebastian(Matt Davis), and Katarin(Michelle Rodriguez) lead the way to find Kagan(Ben Kingsley). To me part of this game based movie is quite similar to \"Castlevania\", however, Dracula is never mention, so that's good. It's amazing that Rayne was sympathetic to the sister whose brother was slain by the vampires. And I liked the part where Rayne seduced the woman vampire and killed her afterward, and the thieves rob her later. Just like the game, Rayne has a hot body, and Sebastian took advantage of \"being inside her\". Reminds me of \"Innocent Blood\". It's a shame that Katarin turned out to be a turncoat, and everything is way out of whack. How would the fighters know? The effects and the fight scenes were indeed awesome, and the blood was just too much. It's great that Loken got to do more and show very much in this movie. I know Rayne was heartbroken when Sebastian decided to die than to live forever, for him why live when your family is avenged. It's a pity that he would be dead than live with the soul mate who is indeed \"shared her heart\". I'd been a fool to sacrifice when there's more terror out there. A very interesting movie, lots of action, lots of fun, and it's great for all the fans of the game. I enjoyed it a lot! It was interesting and intriguing. Rating 2.5 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "I have a confession to make: I am a HUGE Uwe Boll fan.There's no limit to how bad this guy can get. He claims his heart is in the right place, but all he does to back up that claim is throw poorly constructed one-dimensional characters into a story filled with what he can figure out in rotting SFX, blood-spurts, and completely random gratuitous sex scenes! The best part is that he doesn't let get ideas like \"exposition\" or \"character development\" get in the way... no, it's a straight through, opening shot-to-closing shot heyday of complete ineptitude! Thus, it's an entertaining good time... if your mind is in the right place.Along to share the joke with us are a mixed cast, everyone from the action-movie-star-overmelodramatic Michelle Rodriguez to the thespian Ben Kingsley himself. You can basically measure each actor's ability in this movie not by how they deal with the material, but how large each one's smirk is throughout the proceedings. Billy Zane, Michael Madsen, Ben Kingsley, and Meat Loaf all run their lines behind a half-tilted curve of lips, winking at us with their visages, playing a game that Uwe Boll never gets.The rest of the actors run around spouting one-liners at an incredible rate... when not engaging in another blood-fest. Hey I got to admit, that blood was ENTERTAINING blood... only it wasn't \"cool\" or \"awesome\" or \"gory\" or \"amazing effects\" or \"interesting\" or \"crazy\" or any of that... just blatantly, aggressively pointless (everything you've come to expect from these movies). The sex scene was almost as pointless as the one in Alone in the Dark... ALMOST. There was actually written character development leading up to it in the script, it's just that Boll decided to direct around such a use and just lay the lines out and get right to the guy ripping Kristanna Loken's shirt off. Compare to Alone in the Dark, where the sex scene literally comes from nowhere, and we see that little Uwe may be improving a bit. Heck, soon he might make movies that wouldn't offend people if they were straight-to-DVD! Also, I have to admit: this movie is probably one of the cleanest video game adaptations, not because it follows the game (I have no idea), but because it literally plays like one watching a video game. The dialog and exposition is roughly the level you can find from your local Dungeons and Dragons Dungeon Master... assuming he's a beginning DM, not one of those that actually exploits the intricacies of the game to make an interesting story. \"There are three artifacts you must find that can form a union!\" says the old gypsy. Oh boy, harken sires, I hear a quest afoot! The acting is like that voice-acting you get in videogames: say the line with only the appeal to emotion, and move on. Like this: This movie CAN be...very good if I...pause between WORDS and ...fluctuate my voice...I think the shining star of this movie is actually Billy Zane. For some reason, his role totally works, and he ends up being an interesting character. Of course that's probably because he only has, like, two scenes, and both of them are as a sarcastic vampire. A SARCASTIC VAMPIRE! How can you possibly not act that?! --PolarisDiB",

            "content": "Recap: As a little girl Rayne witnessed her mother being raped and murdered by the mighty vampire Kagan. In fact, she herself is the result of one of those rapes and is half human, half vampire, a damphir. This means she has some strengths and some weaknesses. Like being burned by water and healed when drinking blood. A touring freak show uses this, keeps the girl caged and chained, and shows her in their act of freaks. But one night she escapes and starts her hunt for revenge, for Kagan. Kagan himself is hunting too, for three relics that may give him unlimited power. Rayne learns this, and starts her search for the relics, in order to use them to get close to Kagan. In her venture she meets three warriors of the Brotherhood of Brimstone, a secret society sworn to fight all and every vampire.Comments: When watching this I wondered what they were thinking about when making this movie. Based on a popular game, a good cast with some known names and accomplished actors and still this terrible result. Why? How? They should be able to make something better in their sleep.First off, the story, which is not stellar to begin with, is full of small inconsistencies and strange decisions by characters. Often you got the feeling that everything didn't add up, or wondered how stupid that particular character really was. Second the story contains annoyingly much riding, just riding.My next objection is the score. Often totally out of harmony with the story, and other times banal and simple. It never elevated the movie or furthered the story. A good score heightens suspense and sharpens emotions. At best this score was forgotten, at worst it disturbed the movie.But the biggest error of all is the swordplay. The goal with the movie is to show some nice action and fanciful swordplay. Therefore it is surprising and a huge shortcoming that no one seems to be able to handle a sword. Mostly the swords seem to big and heavy, the actors being slow and clumsy with the swords. So the fights become bad, dull and boring and too evidently choreographed. Frequently fighters parry attacks that haven't begun yet. This is surprising because Loken should be more confident with swords and fighting after Curse of the rings, where she was much more confident with the weapons. And other actors supposed to do some swordplay should have had some training, I doubt they ever got it. Now it seems like \"Hey, you guys played knight and fenced with sticks as kids? Then you know how to do it...\" The result is terrible.The only thing this movie has lot of is blood and gore, often of bad quality. But it does have the guts to show \"icky\" moments like run throughs other movies cut. Still, that doesn't warrant the unexplainable highlights rerun at the end...Conclusion: Avoid.3/10",

I was in the process of ripping on From Just To Kelly, which was aptly placed at #3 worst movie of all time, but then I scrolled down to see Bloodrayne. When saying FJTK was the worst movie since Garbage Pail Kids and Howard The Duck, I was clearly mistaken. Bloodrayne along with After Dark get my vote. After Dark I could only sit through 10 minutes of before I had to turn it off and immediately return it to Blockbuster. Better to lose some money than time off of my life. Bloorayne I could only sit through 20 minutes of disbelief.The only reason I even watched it is because Guinevere Turner wrote it, my friend's cousin stars in it and vampire movies are one of my faves. But after seeing this hunk of trash I seriously have to question Miss Turner's actual talents. Every element of this film was bad and not the least bit entertaining. I normally consider Michelle Rodriguez a decent actor but all performances were bad in this film. I can only imagine because they were wondering what would happen to their careers after this film hit the theatres.And the fact that there's been million of vampire tales told and this film STILL couldn't tell vampire lore correctly is just pathetic.This gets my true vote for worst film ever.

However there is also something about various body parts which give vampires power and so on. (Ben Kingsley is the head honcho vampire who looks not like the Oscar winner but more like a robotic clone) Bloodrayne comes together with a cast list that admittedly sounds pretty cool. You have a great cast however Uwe Boll directs them with such ridiculous circumstance that you can see the sweat of embarrassment slide down their brows. Michael Pare has 3 minutes of screen time and looks as if he was trying to audition for the Three Dog Night story, Michael Madsen looks oddly like Howard Stern without the wrinkles and frighteningly enough is Meat Loaf who looks as if he was paying tribute to the Rock Me Amadeus video. What is even more shocking is that this is all boring. You would think that any movie that the actors I had just listed would contribute to non-stop hilarity but sadly it doesn't. Worst of all is the end which for some reason goes into a long flashback depicting what Rayne has seen. It is as if Boll was afraid that audiences had forwarded to the climax and so he decided to sting us with what he missed. It is a mess to behold since things make no sense and the movie is just so terminally boring. Boll should probably stick to making porn at least there his confusing camera angles and lack of coherent story telling would be ignored by viewers looking to satisfy their uh, needs. However given the sex scene in this movie and the one in Alone In The Dark, one assumes that even porno is out of his league.* out of 4-(Bad)",

Sure its not a great film, or maybe even a good film, but for those of us raised on \"bad but fun\" fantasy films like Hawk the Slayer, Ator, Sword and the Sorcerer as well as countless others this is a return to the days of old.The plot has Rayne, a half Human Half Vampire breaking out of a circus where she is being held and going after the vampire king who fathered her. She is pursued by some vampire hunters who think she can help them in their own battles.The script is uneven, the direction just passable but there is something in this film that somehow pulls it all together.The biggest problem is the acting, some of which is non existent. The problem is that Uwe Boll doesn't cast until he's days from shooting so he can get the biggest names he can find with holes in their schedules (and who want/need some fast cash). The result of this is unevenness of performances that make you feel as though everyone is in different movies. Its runs from Udo Keir who is actually giving a performance, Michael Madsen who thinks he's in a western, Billy Zane who is in a comedy and Ben Kingsley who is out acted by one of the worst hairpieces of all time. Kingsley obviously took this for cash or thought his roll was that of a piece of lumber.(Clearly he's in the running for worst performance by an Oscar winner from the last 25 years award) Still somehow this works. No, its not great, but it is an earnest attempt at a fantasy film (and its light years better than some of the recent films like Beasts of Blood that have cropped up in the wake of Lord of the Rings, not to mention other video game movies like Doom).If you like this sort of thing I give it a try, on cable if nothing else.

Not that I cherished his 'House of the Dead', far from it, but at least that movie was bad in a campy way, thus giving out some good laughs in all the wrong places. 'Bloodrayne' is just bad as in boring bad and that is the worst kind of bad quality film can have.The whole movie is a huge mess, even though the plot is easy enough to follow: Rayne (Kristianna Loken) wants to avenge her mothers death, who was killed by Rayne's vampire father Kagan (Ben Kingsley). So Rayne collects a couple of artifacts to stop typical vampire killers, like sun and water, of killing her. Rayne then hitches up with this secret Brimstone society, which also fights against Kagan with the lead of Vladimier (Michael Madsen) and they teach Rayne to fight and offer their help to the bloody end.What makes this straight forwarded story a mess, is the sheer lack of suspension in any scene, shoddily done editing and total lack of interest towards anyone who happens to be killed off on the screen. The scenes are constructed together in amateurish way and unnecessary gimmicks just kill off the workability of the fight scenes. The drama 'Bloodrayne' has to offer is in the genre of bloated, overacted teen Gothic pathos, that is written so poorly, that it isn't even funny.I must mention the acting, as this movie HAS real actors in it. Never I have not seen Ben Kingsley to underachieve as he does in 'Bloodrayne'. Every line he utters from his mouth lack even the slightest nudge towards acting. He just throws out the words with monotonous voice, as he would be bored to death of even being on the movie. The same goes with Michael Madsen. Then again Will Sanderson, trustee of Boll, does his role with such an overacted force, that it's almost shocking. Kristianna Loken can't be accused of being a tremendous actor, but when she can out act both Kingsley and Madsen you might get the general idea of what kind of a work those seasoned veterans pull out to get their paychecks.'Bloodrayne' might have had a chance of being even a mediocre vampire movie, but now the way it was done it is below standards, at least mine.Vampire/horror/Action grade: 1 of 10Camp comedy grade: 1 of 10",

Michael Madsen although having nothing to work with looks good as a vampire hunter. Michelle Rodriguez is doing a good job as well.The sound and score of the movie is also good and here and there actually manages to help build a little tension or suspense.

It's like being in a video game for a really, really long time! And who doesn't like having all the time we need for video games, huh?",

Still, despite its obvious limited budget this is a fairly enjoyable action flick with a surprisingly good cast (how Boll always manages to get such noted actors for his otherwise bad films ever remains a mystery). In 18th Century Romania, Rayne (Kristanna Loken, Terminator 3), a young Dhampir (vampire/human hybrid), lives a meager life full abuse traveling with a circus as a sideshow attraction, but decides to jump ship, after which she finds out her father, Kagan (Ben Kingsley), the king of vampires, raped her mother. Out for vengeance against her father, she teams up with a group of vampire hunters, including Vladimir (Michael Madsen) and Katarin (Michelle Rodriguez) who are at war with Kagan's sinister forces. Kagan himself however means to destroy humanity and has no qualms killing his daughter if it stops her from interfering with his vile schemes. The plot is a bit of a mess and at times hard to follow or nonsensical, while the visual effects often are of poor quality. However, some fine acting and adequate action scenes keep this film from being a total loss, the fate to which many other Uwe Boll films were condemned. If you expect a faithful adaptation of the original video game this movie is based on, forget it.",

I will be lined up (in a line consisting of 2 people)in front of our local theatre to buy tickets for the first show. I think the mistake that some of the posters have made is either not seeing the crap-tastic \"House of the Dead\" or the most unwatchable of his films \"Alone in the Dark\", or thinking his films will get better as he learns his \"craft\". I was once like you, tricked into seeing House of the Dead only to be shat on for an hour and 35 minutes. But after Alone in the Dark came out, I discovered the blinding and wonderful truth of his films. Uwe Boll is a throw back to the great \"USA Up ALL Night\", staring Shannon Tweed and or Shannon Whirry, & generic slasher films of the early and mid - eighties. These films have a special place in heart for whatever reason. It might be because the represent a special part of movie making, the bad formula film.He makes movies based on a formula, a proved formula. Get a known brand with a built in fan base. (in this case, video games that are past their shelf life.)Put this brand into a profitable movie genre such as teen sex comedy (I'm looking at you National Lampoon) or horror film. Wait to cast the film until the last possible minute in order to get as many \"name\" stars as you can for as cheap as you can. (suprise- many stars take rolls just for a paycheck or because the can squeeze it in between projects and collect a paycheck)Throw in gore/mind-numbing action and or nudity and you have yourself a film that will make back it's budget (between 10 to 20 million) worldwide before it ever sees DVD. Roger Corman made himself a name and a fortune doing this type of film making. I'm not saying that his films are any good or even watchable at times. What I'm saying is that I crack the hell up every time I watch one. Enjoy them for what they are, Huge wastes of someone's hard warned money. I swear that I laugh more at these films than I laugh at films like \"Meet the Fockers\".Do yourself a favor and rent Alone in the Dark and see if you can keep from laughing when the Tara Reid says New-found-land.

            "content": "During my tour through 'Garbage cinema', i stumbled upon BloodRayne, which is apparently a video game adaptation, and it is common knowledge that those are generally horrific failures. There is no exception in this case, as this is a laughable piece of work that seems to have an obsession with insulting the viewers intelligence.The cast features some acclaimed actors in the form of Ben Kingsley, Billy Zane & Michael Madsen, which is an unfortunate stain on their careers. Kingsley was the epitome of the dead eyed emotionless underperformer, and much of the same is true with Madsen, who seems to hate being in this film for the entire duration. Zane tries his best to surpass the abysmal script with his acting, but alas, he does not succeed. None of the actors are able to use even the slightliest of emotional ranges, as all of them are incapable of showing a different facial expression. Since some of the actors cast in the movie are indeed incredible, it is obvious they too had little motivation and ambition for such a ridiculous project as this. Every single actor & actress's line delivery in BloodRayne seems like a literal cue card reading session, and the dialogue is insultingly bad. My favorite has to be: 'My companion has gone missing, i do not know what has become of him!!!' which results in one of the most insultingly stupid prison breaks ever filmed. There is no character development. There is not a sequence in which the characters are set up. There is nothing that is told about the characters, and there is simply absolutely nothing that drives them. Rayne's mother was raped by Kegan and seeks revenge, which is the most insulting & clich\u00e9 of motivations there is. It tries so hard to get the viewer to feel sympathy for Rayne because of this, but this clich\u00e9 victim classification is in reality just horrid writing. It is a common feminist delusion that they always classify themselves as the 'Common victim' in every circumstance and this film is basically a propaganda show of political correctness in that way. However, when a film is this bad, its ridiculous PC themes don't even really matter, as nobody could ever take anything about this film seriously.There are a couple of scenes where we witness the aftermath of some event, and director Uwe Boll thinks it is necessary to throw in a couple of disjointed, horribly edited flashbacks in which the viewer learns absolutely nothing else than what they already knew before the flashback. Something simplistic is spoken, and Boll deems it necessary to throw in a flashback because it seems like he doesn't think audience can understand it without it. It is a slap in the face of the audience's intelligence, and also a slap in the face of this film's already nearly non existent intellectuality.While most of the cinematography in BloodRayne is sub par, it does have a couple of nice sweeping outdoor shots when characters ride through the country. However, it also features a lot of brightly lit forest scenes even though it is in the middle of the night & an obvious lack in color variation, as most of the film is grey and dark green. The original score, however, was very good, and these seem to be the only slightly redeeming factors of this snoozefest.The many action sequences feature horrid slow & clunky choreography ( Especially Madsen, no idea how he managed to kill so many guys during this film when he is barely able to swing a sword ), and terrible editing. All of the actors in the film seem to be severely limited in athletics & choreography, and so this is hidden a bit by the fact that there are numerous amount of cuts and edits throughout the fights. The viewer can never see what is going on, or how the fight is turning out. Boll is only interested in showing protagonists kill people and trying to hide their clunky swordplay with his horrid quick editing which will probably damage your eyesight beyond repair. In the end, the film is a basic lesson in how NOT to film action sequences, as its choreography, editing & overview of the fights is just horrible.BloodRayne has terrible acting, writing, choreography, editing, & characters. While some decent shots in its cinematography and an excellent original score make sure it doesn't wind up in the category with some of the actual worst of all time, it is still a sure contender for the places a little bit behind them.",

Thats due to Uwe Boll's hyper-kinetic direction and Kristanna Loken's full on performance. They drive the story at such Pace that you barely have time to sit back and say, \"Gee, that was silly\" There is some silliness here. Rayne, the off-spring of a very malignant vampire lord played by, of all people, Ben Kingsley, and a human mother, is reduced to an abused carnival freak. She breaks free, slaughtering people left and right, only to hook up with the Brimstone three, warriors who battle the undead. She learns her father, Kagan, is trying to find three talismans to unlock secrets that will enable vampires free reign and thus take over the earth. Since he raped and killed her mother, Rayne is happy to saddle up for revenge.Did I mention the action? Terrific battle scenes and more exotic weaponry that you could shake your scimitar at. Loken's acting may not match her physical abilities, but who cares? She's smoking hot here. Michael Madsen, slumming again, is the be-wigged anti-hero Vladimir and he actually does more than the occasional growl. Matt DAvis is the requisite young hunk. He's dull but his scenes with Loken are passionate. Michelle Rodriguez is along as the hard to figure KAtarin, she's very good here, all accent and sullen looks and sex appeal. Rodriguez was one of the best things about the original \"Resident Evil\" and she proves again that she's a talented actress. Billy Zane plays her father, and please more of this terrific actor! He steals both his scenes so easily its like he's in a better movie.Thats not to denigrate Bloodrayne, with is quick, exciting and very bloody, seriously, were talking Bram Stoker here. Rayne ends up absorbing the talismans that Kagan wants, thats weird and never explained very well. How does she do this? Why? The climax of the picture in Kagan's predictably dark castle, is a bit arch and the last shot of Rayne taking her Father's throne is way too enigmatic for me. What does this mean? Is she OK? Or will she be like him? Odd ending. Still I really enjoyed this flick. If your'e not too demanding and enjoy medieval romps with lots of sex and violence, this is a good crowd pleaser.

First of all, whether she comes off on it or not Rayne is a lot more respectable than she was in this film, she is not some cheap slut. She dresses slutty, and speaks vulgarly, but has somewhat of an interesting, and intelligent, persona. Also, Kristina Loken is ugly, I'm sorry, but she is. She looks NOTHING like Rayne, and even the HAIR was the wrong colour. Not the wrong shade, wrong COLOUR. Rayne's hair is scarlet-ruby red, Loken's was strawberry blonde. Also, the acting was atrocious, the casting in general was awful, the storyline was ridiculously inaccurate, and it looks like the people at Maleco (SP?) didn't even know there was a movie being made.

'Alone in the Dark', but nevertheless, I really enjoyed his 'BloodRayne', and it kept me entertained all the way through. The film was filled with action and a straight story, okay acting and wonderful bloody B-movie action.My only catch with the film, is the lack of character development. You don't get much time to get to know the individual characters, which is a shame because the story is a wonderful and DARK adventure. Kristanna Loken is a great actress, and she looks marvelous and sexy as the vengeful Rayne.I've seen a lot of films in my life, and believe me when I say that there is much more worse films on the market than 'BloodRayne', ex. 'Aeon Flux', 'Van Helsing' and 'Catwoman'. What makes 'BloodRayne' so good is among others the dark atmosphere, some well placed horror, not too much CGI, NO irritating one liners and great bloody B-movie effects. Maybe Uwe Boll's film-making is not the best, but believe when I say that 'BloodRayne' has got much more beating that it has deserved.",

            "content": "This is a review of the DVD version.Basically it's a tale of Bloodrayne, a dhampir (half-human, half vampire, popularized by Blade, but actually a real legend, albeit in real folklore they could just sense vampires, they didn't have superhuman strength) who basically wants revenge on her vampire father, Ben Kingsly. She's being pursued by the forces of her father, along with a trio of vampire hunters headed by Michael Madsen and Michelle Rodriguez, who she eventually joins forces with.It's set in the 16th Century, but is hardly historically accurate (and as an adaption of a video game, it was hardly meant to be). The movie is rather jerky, in that it doesn't transition smoothly from scene to scene, but there are leaps in what's going on. Little to no characterization, either. In a way, it reminds me a lot of Tsui Hark's movies. And like his movies, this movie actually looks very nice, cinematographically. Some really vivid colors, landscapes, etc.There's quite a bit of fighting scenes and quite a bit of gore, but the fighting is all very fake looking.On the surface the cast is pretty decent, but Michelle Rodriguez is the only one who actually acts or at least, takes it seriously. The lead actress seems to be a female version of Keanu Reeves - she has two expressions - confused and blank. Michael Madsen just is hard to take serious in a role like this. Meat Loaf looked like he had fun, mostly he just rolled about and fondled a gaggle of Romanian prostitutes, which I guess would be enjoyable. It's not a terrible movie, just a fairly standard B movie. Not unlike something put out by Hammer studios in the early 70s, combined with the sword & sorcery movies of the early 80s.

House of the Dead for me was a truly painful experience and Alone in the Dark, although better, still felt like eating a sloppy turd (dont ask me how i know what eating a sloppy turd feels like...) I watched this film because of mainly 2 reasons: 1 - To see if Uwe can get redemption from his earlier game to film adaptation.2 - I am a big film fan, and like the vampire / horror genre.The film is purely awful from start to finish. The only good thing I can possibly think of is that the cast is definitely impressive for a film of this caliber. Michael Madsen, a legend of cult cinema, sways his way through the film swinging a sword like he's drunk. Ben Kingsly mumbles about as if he's simply bored. Kristanna Loken looks beautiful but doesn;t carry the furiosity of Rayne....and therefore simply doesn't create a sense of believability. Michelle Roudriguez looks as if she'd rather be doing some porn film and Meat Loaf just seems to be on aboard for the opportunity to lounge around in a room full of prostitutes.The sword fighting / battle scenes on show are beyond disgrace. There was obviously no choreography involved and the actors / actresses clearly didn't have the time to be put into training sessions. The sets and wardrobe all feel like castouts from Harry Potter or Lord Of The Rings.There is a sex scene involving the beautiful Kristanna Loken and some Matt guy....instead of increasing a romantic sub plot, tension or signs of \"human emotion\" within Rayne...the scene simply feels like a seqence from a porn film has been lifted into the film.All in all the only praise I can give this film is that it finally ended.

            "content": "Uwe Boll recently challenged his critics to a boxing match to put an end to all the bad things said about his films (which inspired me to review his films here). Doesn't resorting to fists sort of admit defeat on the intellectual level? I've got a more appropriate challenge in mind: a bout, not with fists but with cameras. I'm calling out Uwe Boll. Each challenger gets a small budget, a camera, a crew, and a short time to make a short film. When the films are completed they are both presented to the judging panel at Cannes. May the best director win. I'm not worried, because I know I could make a better film than any of the Boll films I've seen (for all I know \"Blackwoods\" will be \"Citizen Kane\", but I doubt it).Nothing boosts my confidence better than a film as depressingly bad as \"BloodRayne\". Before you notice Boll's name, the others give you hope for the potential: Guinevere Turner (\"American Psycho\", \"The L Word\"), Ben Kingsley, Billy Zane, Udo Kier, Michael Madsen\u0085 and for some Michelle Rodriguez and Kristina Loken. Once again, the source is a game, resulting in the usual lame plots and outfits, but this is not always the kiss of death. I'd like to think that Turner's script was probably a pretty solid piece of writing to start with\u0085 So, it's the middle ages again and humans have a big problem with vampires. Gandhi plays Kagan, King of the Vampires and father (by way of rape, so say the flashbacks) of Rayne (Loken), a half vampire (like \"Blade\"), which are called dhampirs in this film's universe. Sebastian and Vladamir (Davis and Madsen) are vampire hunters on Rayne's trail after she escapes from the circus. Meanwhile she's collecting body parts from a dead vampire, which Kingsley also needs for some kind of vampire supremacy and to walk in daylight (like \"Blade\"). Anyhow, the vampire hunters and the half-vampire join forces and set out on a quest to defeat the king of the vampires.So, what could possibly go wrong with that? For one, a budget of $25 million. Some incredible things can be done on a small budget, just look at the films of Scorsese (especially \"Last Temptation\"), George Miller, Joe Carnahan, or even Samuel Fuller. Unfortunately, Uwe Boll's name does not belong with the others. Yes, this film was shot on location in Romania, using real castles and helicopter shots. The trouble is that Boll's inept camera makes the locations look fake and the helicopter shots aren't enough to create that epic feel they were trying for. Meanwhile the tasteless dungeon sex scene and the excessive gore (especially in the last five minutes of the director's cut) remind us that this is exploitation. Exploitation dressed up in CG, millions of dollars, star cameos, and Romanian castles is almost worse because it could have been something more. That is, it could have been something more if not for Uwe Boll.Not only did this DVD have Boll's usual sad commentary (this time joined by Loken and friends), but it also had a feature called \"Dinner with Uwe Boll\" which is Boll eating dinner with a couple in their dining room and talking about how he got into film. I found it very telling that Boll said he dropped out of film school because of all the theory and the \"talking, talking, talking\". Yes, sir Mr. Boll, your genius is evident. I'll be standing by to sing my praise for \"In The Name of the King\", \"Seed\", \"Postal\", \"Far Cry\", and whatever other video game movies you manage to churn out before Germany abolishes the tax shelter and the investors desert you.",

However, it also opens the door for much hilarity laced with vitriol, of which I am a fan. As per usual, I'll try to avoid finer plot details in favor of some highlights that made me smile.First and foremost is Michael Madsen, who deserves some kind of award for being bad on a number of levels. I imagine if I was near him he would both smell and feel bad, since he looks and sounds so horrible. Alas I'm not volunteering to taste. He looks greasy and frightening.Madsen has a splendid Middle Ages mullet that I couldn't stop staring at for much of the movie. Thankfully he never says anything important or believable at any moment, so it's okay to be distracted. Maybe even preferable, since his acting in this movie has less feeling than a comatose quadriplegic's foot after he slept on it funny. During some scenes you're just waiting for the unchewed Valiums to dribble out the side of his mouth on a tiny river of sleep spit.Not to be outdone by his poor skills with speaking and looking awake, he ventures into an \"action\" role, which demands the use of quotation marks as it really doesn't reflect Webster's definition of action in any way. More of a logy, ambling, oafish, drunken bear with muscle cramps trying to dance ballet.In Madsen's meager defense, mind you, is the action at large. Sweet Mary Sunshine can Uwe Boll make anything and everything look absolutely ridiculous. Never have I seen so many horribly plotted fight scenes with actors who look like they've just picked up the plastic swords in their hands for the first time. And never have I seen so many shots of the most mind-boggling, low-budget, sorry-ass wannabe gore slapped right in the middle of fights with long, lingering shots that actually pause the action so you can stop to appreciate just how fake it all looks.Also worth nothing is Michelle Rodriguez's stunning accent (is that the Queen of England? Nope, it's MRod!), Ben Kingsley's henchman who gets his hair cut at the same joint that did Vanilla Ice back in the day (and most likely went to the same acting school) and Meatloaf in what might be the most pointless/god-forsaken role in film history.Boll didn't let anyone down with this movie, it's as bad as all his others and then some. Admittedly, I think he makes movies this bad on purpose in order to gain more publicity than he otherwise would with just an average movie, but that doesn't matter. Uwe Boll can make movies that are worse than having your genitals burnt with cigars, and that's impressive.",

Among its best features is the old-time setting as it's such a welcome change from what is normally given to us about vampires. It also plays a part of it being a nice sweeping epic-look to it with the sweeping vistas and swelling orchestral scores and is a really pleasant change to see a film go for a feel like that with a very epic feeling present throughout here. In addition, the inclusion of her vampire tendencies in that type of storyline allows for some enjoyable action present here, starting with the beginning where a carnival man drags her out and spills water on her arm, resulting in severe burns before the blood of a farm animal causes her wounds to instantly heal back to normal, the carnival massacre is a nice set-piece that enables her escape into the world as well as the manipulation of several traps held in the church for their protection. It's best sequence is where one character is trapped inside a quickly flooding cavern which is nicely suspenseful, as is a daytime raid on a brothel to rescue a kidnapped ally. There are also several well-choreographed extended battles here that wouldn't seem out of place in a medieval movie to provide lots of action, from the assault on the monastery to capture her to the various battles that take place inside the temple at the end which manages to contain plenty of action, confrontations and graphic bloodshed which is really nice and bloody. This is far better than what is said about it as there is very little in here that didn't work. The main thing that hurts this is the side-plots that are thrown in every now and then to try to add more to the story but actually take away from it. The main gist here is good enough and serves the film well since there's only a single thread that covers the action. When a new idea is brought up, such as the inclusion of the need for the various amulets to be obtained before anything can transpire or the vampire rituals that are needed to be performed before they can continue their plans, it only confuses rather than explain due to the excessive elements brought in that don't add much. As well, the change in nature from the video-game to the movie is a little different which might be a problem for some to get over. These here are what manage to hold this one down.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Language, Nudity and a mild sex scene.",

The plot surrounds BloodRayne a dhampir (half human/vampire) and her quest for revenge for her mothers death by the hands of the King of all vampires Kagan (Ghandi..yes it's him...great casting) Along the way comes 3 vampire hunters (Madsen, Davis and Rodriguez) and their Brimstone Society to aid her quest and there you have it. Oh and a steaming bad sex scene to. Joy joy. Anyway since D&D 2 blows even more and the gore factor is quite OK I have to settle for a 2 rating rather than 1. Sigh....",

Watching him slowly stagger through his lines gave me the impression I was watching a really bad William Shatner/Christopher Walken impersonation on Saturday Night Live. Not to mention his delivery reminded me of an emotionless Data played by Brent Spiner on Star Trek. Like Data, Madsen appears incapable of using conjunctions when he speaks.I find it hard to believe that such an awful performance could go unnoticed by the casting director, the director, other cast members, Madsen himself, and anyone else who happened to be present while Michael destroyed every scene he was in. This may sound harsh, but his performance is so bad I suggest you watch this movie just to see it first hand. It's like passing by a bad car accident on your way to work, you don't want to look, but you just can't look away.In short, Madsen's performance made a bad movie worse.",

The acting wasn't too bad .Ben Kingsley whatever he is in he turns in a good performance. Michael Madsen and Billy Zane also put in good performances. I was also glad to see Michael Pare and Geraldine Chaplin in the film.

I thought this had a lot of potential and failed miserably. Based on a computer game (first strike against it), this takes a fairly good plot and puts a very bad cast together on a low budget.There are good actors in this that do a good job. Both Ben Kingsley and Billy Zane are good, but really only have minor roles. The rest seem to have poor direction and the star of the movie (Kristanna Loken) can not seem to act.

And still i was surprised as well as disappointed.The thing i wondered most is what kind of dirt Uwe Boll must have on actors like Ben Kingsley and Michelle Rodriguez to get them to appear in a movie like this one. Granted, they are not the biggest actors but still they have some sort of career at least. On the other hand, Michael Madsen seems to be stuck in some sort of infinite loop of crap so seeing him here is as expected. The funniest appearance is Billy Zane who seems to be unable to take this movie seriously, which is probably a healthy approach. And what about Kristanna Loken? Well it would surprise me greatly if her career in big movies would continue, she's quite an awful actress really. Unable to deliver her lines properly and lacking all kinds of subtlety.And the movie itself? The action scenes are mostly pathetic, dialog is uninteresting and stiff and to say the movie has serious pacing problems is an understatement. If i should try and find something positive to say then well... some of the locations are quite nice i guess? And there is some decent photography. But don't get me wrong, these points are like buying a new car and concluding that the only positive thing with it is that the steering wheel feels nice in your hands. That will hardly do you any good if the car won't even run.To ask what could have been done better is almost futile. Both the parts and the whole are terminally flawed. I just wonder when someone will finally pull the plug on this Uwe Boll-character. Not that video games are the best basis for movies, but seriously someone else must be able to do this better.",

            "review_title": "Entertaining and trivial, but (in the theatrical version) not all that bad",
            "content": "This is not a major piece of fantasy film-making, but neither is it anywhere near as bad as many would appear to think. It's considerably better than, say, 'Dungeons and Dragons,' and in some ways comparable even to John Boorman's wildly uneven 'Excalibur'. It's reasonably entertaining, which is all it really sets out to be, and thus it's rather more mediocre than truly atrocious.The highlight of the film is undoubtedly the score, primarily by Henning Lohner. It's omnipresent (which is not always a bad thing in these sorts of films), but it manages to work up considerable excitement and even a fair measure of grandeur (aided in part by an odd motivic echo of the opening of Cliff Eidelman's score for 'Star Trek VI' ). The closing sequence of the film is much more impressive than might have been expected, in large part due to the music. In fact, proportional to the overall quality of the respective films, this score is considerably better than that for 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe'.The production values, while far short of the Narnia and Lord of the Rings films, are not so cheap as to detract from the fun. Some of the sets (Kagan's central hall, for example), have real presence, and the FX are always at least passable and sometimes striking. The cinematography , while generally derivative in style and appearance, is at its best in the slower sequences; the action sequences tend to be choppy and even unintentionally blurry. In fact, had this film been a little less determined to whip up action so often, it would have been the better for it. There's a nice sequence where Rayne walks through a town market and sees the vampires beneath the human faces which suggests how much the film would have benefited from a less frenetic pace, for example.The weakest element is the acting. Kristanna Loken, in the title role, is adequate and sometimes expressive (her final on-screen moments do not draw all of their power from the music); given more room to develop, her character portrayal might well have been more emotionally moving. Geraldine Chaplin manages to make the small role of the Fortuneteller relaxed and believable. Ben Kingsley has physical presence but little more as the villain; Michael Madsen is wretched as the leader of the anti-vampire group, as is Meat Loaf as an rather louche vampire. The rest of the players are generally competent but unexciting.The screenplay, by Guinevere Turner, is not as confusing as some have claimed (or at least it didn't especially confuse me). There's not much in the way of character development, but as that is rarely the case in sword-and-sorcery films it seems unfair to belabor the point here. The motivations of the major characters are reasonably clear, if one-dimensional, and there is at least some attempt to give Rayne more depth than her type is usually allowed, which pays off in the ambiguous final shot.I suspect that many people have watched this film expecting it to be wretched, given the reputation of director Uwe Boll. Having never seen any other Boll films, I am in no position to comment on his work as a whole, but it strikes me that the reaction to this one, at least, is rather unfair. Although it's not very good, neither is it awful; while there are many better films even within its genre, there are surely many more that are far far worse.--This review was written regarding the theatrical release. Some years later I happened to see the DVD version, which is, oddly enough, noticeably worse. Apparently the production company tamped down Uwe Boll's desire for gore for the U.S. release, a desire he was able to exercise fully in the DVD version. The result is a much choppier (so to speak) and less effective film. I begin to understand why so many people think Boll is such a bad director....--",

The movie is a confused mess and even the top names that appear in the film can't save it from the awful dialouge and directing. It remains a mystery to me how Uwe can get the talented actors to appear in his movies and how he manages every time to pull the worst performance of there career.The exception in bloodrayne is Michelle Rodriguez who manages to be convincing even with the lack of direction and awful script i only hope the movie does not damage the careers of any of the other amazing actors who appear in this crapfest.Despite being burnt time and time again i'm sure i will watch dungeon siege (i'm also pretty sure i'll hate it and kick myself again) and will continue to hold on to the slight hope that one day Uwe will actually make a good job of one of his movies because the video game fan in me still gets excited by the concept of game to movie franchise's.If you are like me regardless of what I or anyone else says you will watch this movie just remember when your trying to throw yourself off a bridge for putting yourself through another Uwe Boll flick that one day he will be dead it is that thought alone allows me to continue to watch his crap.I tried to focus on the positive aspects of this movie but after proof reading what i wrote i can see i failed, oh well i did try.",

I found myself unconsciously trying to cover my eyes with my hand, feeling embarrassed and genuinely sorry for the cast and crew - with the exception, of course, of Uwe Boll himself, who obviously likes this...I can't find a single redeeming feature in it. The story is ridiculous at best, and the costumes and wigs (oh, the wigs...) are made to match. The fight scenes are the worst I've seen (not kidding). We get to see vampire hunters Michael Madsen and Matthew Davis femininely tripping into battle like confused, overgrown ballerinas, and a number of identical chest wounds spray blood like lawn-sprinklers, while every single person involved - including the wounded - look like they just couldn't care less. I wanted to laugh, but just sat and stared in disbelief.All in all, my advice is: Don't watch it. Go rent dear old \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" instead, because compared to this atrocity I'd give it the Academy Award.

Having little hope for \"BloodRayne\" may have played to my favor, as I actually quite liked it. Oodles of blood, guts and a little slinky sex were just what I needed to enjoy this flick, and Boll delivered them in spades.Going back to Romania of yester-year, the story tells of the origin of Rayne and the beginning of her centuries long quest to exact revenge upon her father Kagan and all his minions. It also provides a deeper look into the workings of the brimstone society (an organization that both fears and assists Rayne). For those that enjoyed the game, the story bits are actually of interest, everyone else will promptly ignore them.The cast is a surprisingly eclectic ensemble, but a mixed bag of good and bad choices. The good players are Loken, who aside from looking the part to a 'T', down plays her performance nicely; also Madsen, who plays the grizzled mentor role well; and Kingsly, who carries an air of sadistic menace while refusing to dive into camp territory. On the opposite end are Rodriguez, horribly mis-cast and underused and Meat Loaf in a pointless and bizarre cameo.The production side of the house did pretty much exactly what I wanted it to do. Being filmed in Romania insured little dressing had to be done to make it look like Romania (which is a gorgeous country I might add); plenty of Gothic scenery and decorations abound and the overall product quality is polished for the budget level.The real selling point for me (and I imagine for most horror fans) is the liberal use of the red stuff. Given the violent nature of the game, I was worried that Boll might pull some punches in the gore department. That is blissfully not the case. Some much blood is spilt in regular intervals that this almost qualifies as a gore-fest and is one of the bloodiest theatrical films I've seem in quite some time. Thank the maker.Speaking of the maker, a quick note on Uwe Boll. The much maligned director of 'House of the Dead', 'Alone in the Dark' and several up coming game adaptations has received a really unfair rap as the new Ed Wood. It seems that most people who thrash his movies are either A) bandwagon-haters (some one says it sucks and everyone falls in line) or B) award snobs (if it can't win an award, it isn't worth watching). To this I ask, what were you expecting? It's based on a game about a half-vampire tearing Nazis to shreds. It isn't supposed to win an Oscar or heighten you understanding of the world, it simply exists for you have a little fun, as do Boll's other films.So quit the hating already.7/10",

            "content": "Director Uwe Boll (House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale) was clearly trying to capitalize on the successes of the Resident Evil films and \"Doom\" when he brought \"Bloodrayne\" to the screen. Unfortunately, this film, which went almost straight to video, is but a shadow of those other films. The main problems involve the pacing of the film, the plot and the choice of actors.The plot revolves around Rayne, a \"dhampfir\" or half human/half vampire. She is rescued from servitude to her father, Kagan -- whose vampire/thrall army is poised to overrun the civilized world -- by the remnants of the Brimstone Society. She then joins them and uses her martial arts skills and weapons skills to help find the fabled talismans, parts of a former vampire who managed to discover how to survive sunlight, water and garlic before being taken down.First, let me say that the scenery was spectacular. Obviously, you can't find too much open space or castles to use in America anymore, but these were clearly abundant in Romania. Plus, it wouldn't seem like a vampire movie if Romania wasn't somehow involved. But, that was about the only real good thing to say about this movie. Well, that and that torrid sex scene between Rayne and a Brimstone Society warrior named Sebastian that seemed to have been added just to bring some male viewers into the theaters.Now, for the problems. The DVD cover promised non-stop action and thrills and delivered neither. The pacing of the film slows down way too much in many scenes. The plot about the talismans comes and goes and almost seems like an aside. The plot is hard to follow and looks as if it was made up on the fly.The characters don't get developed. SPOILER -- the Brimstone Society members don't make it out alive, but you don't get to know them well enough to care. Michael Madsen as Vladimir heads the Brimstone Society, but, despite his character having decades of experience, his sword play is amateurish. He did better with a knife in \"Reservoir Dogs.\" Matt Davis as Sebastian looks like he just walked off the set of \"What About Brian\" and didn't have enough time to learn how to use a sword. As Kagan, Ben Kingsley gives a terrible performance, saved only by his natural skill as a swordsman. Kingsley is stuck on one set for the entire film and never leaves it.Worst of all is Kristanna Lokken as Rayne, the dhampfir. She's half vampire/half human like Blade, but can't take sunlight, water or garlic. She says that Kagan is her father and that Kagan raped her mother. Later on, she says Kagan raped and then killed her mother while she watched, as a seven-year old girl, from a hiding spot in a closet, implying she was human once. It was a confusing plot line that is never resolved.Lokken was sexy and tough as the T-X terminator in \"T3: Rise of the Machines\" and she did credible acting jobs in TV shows like \"The L Word,\" \"Painkiller Jane\" and \"Mortal Kombat: Conquest,\" but this role was too much. Her acting is stilted and she delivers her lines flat. A professed romance between her and Sebastian has no chemistry even as she over emotes. Her fighting skills aren't spectacular. In fact, she looks very amateurish in her moves (note: she fights with specially-designed blades that are clearly dull with rounded tips, I guess to avoid her taking out crew members).Alas, the best acting is done by the bit players. Best of all is Michelle Rodriguez, who can't seem to get out of playing tough chick roles in \"Resident Evil,\" \"The Fast & The Furious,\" \"SWAT\" and \"Lost.\" Can someone get her to put down the alcohol long enough for a role where she can really act and not end up dead? But, she is undone by a weak subplot involving her father, Elich, who was once a Brimstone member before he was turned into a vampire. It causes her to be the stereotypical \"inside job\" villain for reasons not clearly or adequately explained. At least, as Elich, Billy Zanes chews up the scenery gleefully.Other good actors with not enough minutes are rocker Meat Loaf as Leonid; Geraldine Chapman (The Three Musketeers, Dr. Zhivago) as a fortune teller, and Udo Kier, ironically fighting vampires as opposed to leading them as he did in \"Blade.\" With all the flat acting, poor plot and poor pacing, the worst affront is the unnecessary gore. Prepare to see monks cut in half in sprays of blood. Monks stabbed in the face with swords. Monks run through with swords. A monk whose shoulder is cleaved from his body. Rayne battles an oafish ogre and crushes his deformed skull with a spiked club and the head ruptures like a watermelon. Bodies are slashed and blood flies like Niagara Falls. In one notorious scene, thralls (humans who have thrown in with vampires, like the \"familiars\" from the \"Blade\" films) hack off a monk's arms and legs. Others cut his gut open and gleefully pound his internal organs with sticks as the blood splashes, while two others play hockey with his head. Director Boll must have thought all the blood would make his film seem more like \"Doom\" and \"John Carpenter's Vampires.\" Oh and a warning. After the climactic fight, TURN OFF THE DVD!!! The last scene is a slow-motion montage of every one of the blood-gushing scenes I just described. Don't ask me why it's in the film, but it is.Boll is making a sequel to this film, even though it grossed only $4 million worldwide and lost money. Do yourself a favor. Make the sequel lose money, too, so he'll stop butchering popular video games.",

When you make a movie and get such bad press and reviews there should only be two things that go through your head. 1.WOW! this movie really bombed, maybe I'm not a good movie director, cut my losses and stay away from movie making or 2. WOW! my last movie really stunk, maybe I should try to do better this time and see if I can be redeemed in the face of the movie going public. A lot of movie directors have had bombs in the past and have taken #2 and have improved tremendously. Take for example Peter Jackson. His first few films like \"Meet the Feebles\" and \"Bad Taste\" are absolutely dreadfully horrid. But his recently works of \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy and \"King Kong\" are giant successes and now hes one of Hollywoods top movie directors. You would think Uwe Boll would get an idea of how bad his movies are with \"Alone in the Dark\". But he seems to be destined to be the next Ed Wood Jr. but even Ed Woods movies now have a cult following and have fallen in the \"so bad its good\" category.

            "content": "This movie was bad. I reserve a 1-star rating for movies that are totally incoherent and atrocious. That is not Bloodrayne; from what I've heard, that would describe director Uwe Boll's earlier movie, House of the Dead. A 3-star rating is for bad movies with a coherent story, and everything else being the minimum possible level of competence.What does 2 stars mean? Well, it means that the movie tells a functioning, coherent story. That's all the movie accomplishes.The cinematography ranged from minimally competent to painful. I have never seen action scenes so utterly devoid of tension as I have in this film. There could be a big fight sequence going on, and you could find yourself falling asleep. The quick-cutting style of the action doesn't help either.Bad though the cinematography may be, it pales in comparison to the acting. Marsden is able to inform you of something about his character through his acting; that he is playing a grizzled veteran of Vampire fighting. He also tells you that he, Marsden, is hopelessly bored by everything that is happening. At no time does he give the character any form of life or depth, nor does he react reasonably to others. He's there to collect a paycheck.Sir Ben Kingsley is even worse. Want to know a secret? I have uncovered the reason why actors who are in a movie just to get paid are terrible at it. It's because they have no leverage with the director. If Boll wanted Kingsley to sit in the throne for 90% of the movie, which he does and it is as stupid as it sounds, what could Kingsley do to refuse it? Walk off the set and not collect his paycheck? It's not just that the actor doesn't care; it's that the actor has no leverage to hold over the director to use to get some of his ideas in.This may be why Boll is notorious for hiring his actors at the last possible minute. Not only do you get them on the cheap, but they do what you say or they don't get paid.I have to hand it to Kristanna Loken though. She tried. She tried as hard as she could. I got the feeling that Michelle Rodriguez did too. But two things were against Kristanna. One, she's just not a good enough actress to pull off the subtleties that I'm sure the role was trying to achieve. But something more important failed, pretty much, everyone in the movie (besides the director): the script.A grand atrocity of scriptwriting has been committed here. If this same script was reshot with the finest set of actors and actresses under the direction of whomever you feel is the worlds greatest director, it'd still be a mess. Turner's script, combined with whatever script changes Boll threw (up) in, is a horror.As an example, Rayne is given a speech to say towards the end to perk up the courage of her stalwart companions. It is literally 3 lines and it's the saddest lines you could possibly come up with. Loken says them about as well as they can be said, but when the material fails you, no acting skill can make it better.There's a cross in the movie that is given all kinds of setup as being important. It's given to various people with the suggestion that it will help protect them. Thus, it's quite a surprise when one of the main characters dies with it on at the end. No protection granted, so what was the point of the setup? The story is functional in the sense that progresses from beginning to end in a way that makes a degree of sense. However, elements of the story fail altogether.There are these three items that the badguy wants. Rayne accidentally absorbs one of them (coincidentally, just in time to give her an immunity to water right before she was doused in it). Later, when the other two items are show, they're in these boxes. A bit later on, we see one of the boxes opened, but the item isn't there. Did Rayne absorb that too (she was present at the time), sometime offscreen? I don't know, and the movie isn't helping to clear that up.The direction fails, of course. Scenes have gross continuity errors. People will be somewhere, and then conveniently gone in the next cut. Boll doesn't know what he's doing. Supposedly according to others, he's gotten better. This only makes me very grateful to have not seen his prior movies.Oh, and no review would be complete without pointing out the gratuitous sex scene. It literally just happens, apropos of nothing. Strangely enough, right after Rayne was remembering murdering a bunch of people including a close friend of hers. I won't lie; it was nice to see Loken's assets, but it's so not worth the price of admission. Like, seeing the movie. Not the cost of the movie, mind you. Even watching it for free costs too much just for a boob shot; you can see equally fine breasts on late-night cable, and without the horrific movies attached.Basically, the film tells a marginally coherent story; that's the best thing that can be said about it. Every other aspect of this movie is pretty much terrible and/or inept.As for the fact that it's from a video game, that is irrelevant. It's a bad movie regardless of its inspiration.",

Now, I'm not saying that all of Uwe Boll's movies are bad, it's just that his specialty are artsy foreign flicks, which are sadly probably better than his video game movies.

The lead character that played Rayne was perfect for the part. The rest of the cast were top notch actors in their own right. But when the director is not sure what they want or how to either convey that thought or get the cast \"into the part\", then Bloodrayne is the result.

He is followed closely by Ben Kingsley, Meatloaf and their bad hairpieces. I wish there was more of Udo Kier, I loved him as Yuri in the Command and Conquer game series. The sets and props were also pretty good, as was the music.

This is a trashy B-movie, yes, but it's no different to a dozen or so others I could mention. B-movie lovers might actually enjoy it, given that it's relatively action-packed and fills the relevant quotients of gore (CGI augmented for the most part, unfortunately) and nudity (brief). The main problem BLOODRAYNE has lies in Boll himself, who shoots the various fight scenes very poorly and who has trouble getting authentic performances out of his cast members.Kristanna Loken (TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES) is the titular character and to say her performance is wooden would be an understatement. She's absolutely terrible; rarely do we see such bad acting from leading actors, but this badness is the stuff of legend. Boll knows this, so he rounds out his cast with a ton of familiar faces. We get Ben Kingsley as the hammy villain, cameos from Michael Pare and Geraldine Chaplin, Meat Loaf chewing the scenery with relish, and even a bewigged Billy Zane, playing it tongue-in-cheek. The main actors are a slumming-it Michael Madsen and an out-of-place Michelle Rodriguez.

I can see myself as a teenager out with the gang, watching this as a midnight showing in a theater and having a blast making fun of it! \"Bloodrayne\" is a rather campy version of \"Blade\", set in medieval times and with a female lead (Rayne) occupying the Wesley Snipes role. She is a half breed human/vampire that only requires blood to heal herself, so she is not compelled to feed like the other vampires in the movie are required to do. She is the product of a rape which occurred between her human mother and, of course, the most powerful vampire on the planet.As the story progresses, we discover that Rayne truly hates her vampiric brethren, and has a self appointed mission in life. In predictable fashion, she is required to complete a couple of quests before she can obtain the object of her goals, and she meets up with a specialized team of folks along the way that assist her in the completion of these tasks.\"Bloodrayne\" stars nobody of any real consequence other than the role of the main villain, played rather lethargically by Ben Kingsley. There are no other truly notable performances in the movie. The character of Rayne, played by Kristanna Loken, was very underdone. I constantly harp on things like this--underacted roles--and I'm starting to hate my reviewing because of it. The role had such potential, and could have been played with so much more passion than she played it with. Rather than playing a determined vengeful character, Kristanna played the role from the perspective of a naive, insignificant nymph. Such a waste of a potentially awesome, sword-wielding, leather-clad, Xena-type warrior role. She could have been AWESOME! Personally, I blame her for the problem, but I suppose that the director could have been at fault--it was his job to make sure that he got the desired effect from her characterization. It's really difficult to tell who's really to blame.With all of this bashing that I'm doing to the film, you might think that I really hated it. This isn't at all true--I rather enjoyed watching this movie. It was just campy enough to be fun--something that always entertains me. The costumes were almost believable, and I enjoyed watching to see what people were wearing for their roles. The story was barely plausible, but good enough to get by.While I'm really glad I didn't pay cash to go see it in a theater setting, I wasn't mortified by renting it, and on a really dead night I just might be willing to give it a second look.",

            "content": "This may not be a great movie, but I firmly believe that it shouldn't be in the bottom 100. Some people are just giving it a 1 because of the director.I agree that Uwe Boll is a horrible director, but you cannot judge a movie just cause he directed it. I watched 'House Of The Dead' and, yes, it was awful. That movie deserves to be number 1 in the bottom 100. 'Alone in the Dark' wasn't so good either. But this is the best Uwe Boll movie when compared to them. You just hate it because of the director. If the movie was exactly the same, and the director name was different, the rating would be much higher than it is now, cause there's a difference between; not liking a movie, and not wanting to like a movie.The one's who hate this movie, all have the same excuses which don't make sense if you think about it: One of them is when the say that the blood and violence was fake and stupid. Now that is no excuse why a movie should deserve a 1. Kill Bill Vol. 1 one had the same type of fake violence (if not worse), but no one says that they hate it because of that. Some also say that they hate it because of the bad acting. Now, the acting wasn't so great, but it's also no reason why you should give a movie a 1. The two bad actors where Michelle and Ben. Besides those, Matt, Michael, Billy and Kristanna gave a good performance in my opinion. Plus, every movie has its bad and good actors. If everyone rated Underworld Evolution by the acting, it would definitely be in the bottom 100Another one is when they say that Uwe Boll is a bad director. Now, not that I don't agree with it, but even a bad director can come up with something good sometimes. Maybe, Uwe Boll realized that his previous two movies sucked, and tried harder this time.They also say that they hate is because the story makes no sense. So, here's the story if you didn't understand it: **SPOILERS BELOW**A dhampir (a half-human vampire) called Rayne, watched her human mother get raped and killed by her vampire father, who was some kind of vampire leader. She escapes from the circus that she was kept prisoner in, and passed through a lot of near-death experiences to get to him. Meanwhile, three vampire hunters help Rayne in her journey since her father was a leader of their opponents, and killing him had been one of their goals for a long time. In the end, everyone dies except for Rayne. Pretty simple huh? Underworld Evolution has the approximately the same story, but somehow, the rating is much higher. That should tell you that people are just voting one because it's made by Uwe Boll, not because of the actual movie.So, only rent it if you try to like it, not if you stay thinking about the awfulness of Uwe's previous movies. This was the first movie I saw from Uwe Boll, so my judgment is purely on the movie, since I had never seen anything from the same director before. I watched the other 2 later, which, unlike BloodRayne, turned out to be a complete disaster. I give it a 10 not because it's some sort of masterpiece, cause it isn't. It's because it's a very good upgrade from Uwe Boll, and it's extremely entertaining along the way.",

            "content": "Blunt and forthright though the direction was, I found no fault with the first 7.5 minutes. Then 'BloodRayne' leapt to a scene two story beats ahead, flashing back to that which preceded it sequentially. Stir in significant overacting from star Kristanna Loken, and the stage is set for one big mess.I knew what I was getting into. The film is infamous, and I'd previously seen a few of Uwe Boll's other films. And still I watched. Ultimately, much to my surprise, I don't think it's entirely as bad as what its reputation portends - but that's obviously not saying much.Many noteworthy names appear in the cast, and they've all proven themselves elsewhere again and again. But Boll's vision forces them into such ham-fisted, cockamamie performances that if one knew nothing else of Loken, Madsen, Kingsley, Rodriguez, or the rest, one would be forgiven for thinking their craft exactly equivalent to Boll's. It's like their paycheck for 'BloodRayne' was conditional on either the most perfunctory of speech and physical movement, or the most exaggerated - with no allowance for a middle ground.Scenes of action and bloodshed hold promise, but from the earliest moments are shot in a jarringly haphazard manner. I'm guessing Boll considered his style here to be novel in a way that would fuel excitement, but instead the frenzied camerawork feels amazingly amateurish, constantly threatening our engagement. Special effects employed during these action scenes, and especially in the most bloody and gory instances, feel less believable than in any other picture that immediately comes to mind. It's one matter to be pointedly over the top, above all if such is the tone of the film generally; consider John Carpenter's brilliant, deadpan 'Ghosts of Mars.' It's another matter entirely to execute visuals with such little care for how they blend into a \"serious\" horror action-thriller that they're readily recognizable as CGI. And that's largely just how they're presented in 'BloodRayne.'I'm given to understand that Boll substantially rewrote what established screenwriter Guinevere Turner provided. This seems plainly truthful - for, astoundingly, there's a solid foundation to the screenplay. I think there are many genuinely great ideas throughout the feature, which together form the underpinnings of what could have been a decisively honored classic. If Turner's draft still existed somewhere in the world, I would quite like to see it realized as a feature.But then the work of Boll's heavy-handed directness bursts through the pages, saturating the picture with schlock. Dialogue is often hackneyed, always feeling rushed and heedlessly straightforward so as to advance the plot as fast as possible. So it is too with characterizations, and most story beats generally. Consider a very early exchange between Rayne and a seer, pushing our heroine forward: Rayne, given information, asks \"Why do you tell me this?\" - and the throwaway supporting character states outright, \"Because it's my purpose!\"So it is with 'BloodRayne' as a whole. I honestly like the set design and decoration, makeup, costume design and wardrobe, and the props on hand. Yet into these are inserted such bluster, bombast, and balderdash that they're subsumed by the low quality of the most actively off-putting aspects. Maybe it's unfair, but I'm inclined to believe that those scenes that are most well-done overall are the remnant's of Turner's screenplay, while the most tawdry moments represent Boll's handiwork. Composer Henning Lohner's music likewise alternates between \"suitable\" and \"laughable.\"I think 'BloodRayne' also deserves special mention for what is possibly the least sexy or exciting sex scene ever committed to film. And it's just as notable that upon the conclusion of the climactic fight, we're given a perfect shot to end on that I again assume was penned by Turner. That would-be achievement is then cast aside for a needless, pointless, excessive montage revisiting previous story beats and bloodbaths before the credits roll. Boll's idea, no doubt.I admit I'm a little torn. There are parts of this movie I actually like, far exceeding my expectations and suggesting underappreciated value. On the other hand, within and around what I judge to be a strong framework is clustered entirely too much subpar, over the top, ill-considered, poorly realized content that all too easily balances the scales. Watching is a constant oscillation between \"This has no business being this good\" and \"This is exactly what I was told to anticipate.\"To be fair, it's also possible that I've soaked in too many substandard flicks of late, such that this one just seems like gold by comparison.Is 'BloodRayne' exactly as bad as everyone says it is? Yes and no; it has, startlingly, some redeeming qualities. Is 'BloodRayne' worth going out of your way to find? No, absolutely not - not for general audiences, certainly, and probably not even for B-movie buffs. Is it possible to enjoy 'BloodRayne' anyway? Yes, I really do think so - so long as you're fully aware of what you're getting into.Not a particularly good movie - yet, shockingly, not Uwe Boll's worst.",

Even Billy Zane sucked, its sad an actor I used to admire has fallen so far down the ladder...I mean did he need the rent money or what? It was mainly the actors and the dialogue that made this such a bad movie. My friend and I could not decide who was a worst actor Madsen or Rodriguez? Personally I feel it was a tie.Madsen looked like he was drunk the entire film and Rodriguez was trying way to hard to pull of an accent of some kind. It was almost as bad as watching Keanu Reeves try to do an English accent. Honestly at one point Madsen and Rodriguez switched accents, and then they switched back again. It went from English to Romanian to Street and back to English again. Even Ben Kingsley the great Ben Kingsley sucked as well. As for the main actress Kristanna Loken, if not for my huge crush on her I would not of seen this movie to begin with.

Since there are no firearms in this movie Uwe Boll really couldn't screw it up as bad as some of his previous movies. While I'm not a fan, I think it was as entertaining as most movies of this ilk, such as Deathstalker, Blade 3, and most modern remakes. I enjoyed Billy Zane's silly performance and above that, Michael Madsen looked like he was going to roll his eyes after every line. Ben Kingsley is still a fine actor, even after being in this movie. Michelle Rodriguez looks delicious as always. I enjoyed seeing her in this. I enjoyed the bloody fight scenes and the vampiric sets. It was a fairly good-humored movie. I can 100% assure you that this isn't one of the 100 worst movies of all time. I can understand that people hate Uwe Boll and deservedly so but this is pretty typical b-movie swashbuckling fare. Nothing really great here but nothing really terrible either. I mean we're not talking about Gone With the Wind here or American Beauty. This is a video game movie and I liked it better than either of the Mortal Kombat movies, which should have been bloodier like this.

People who can't stand anything but top notch acting might want to consider other options I guess.However, as a not-very-realistic type action movie, it's not bad. It's no deep and thought-provoking movie, but it does its job as decent action entertainment for one evening. In my humble opinion, it's clearly on par with movies in the same segment, such as \"Van Helsing\" and \"Tomb Raider\". And it's about a thousand times better than, say, \"Doom\".I would have expected an IMDb rating of about 5 for this one, and objectively I think that would probably be an appropriate one.

They got Rayne's hair absolutely spot on, she was even better than she is in the computer game. The acting was of a fine standard, with Michael Madsen putting in one of the all time great movie performances, peppered with nuance and aching with purvivre. I'm not usuallally into violent movies, often i find the violence in films gratuitous and irrelevant to the story, like in war films. I abhor all forms of violence, but, and this is a big butt, the violence in this movie was brilliant!! There is a scene where a big monster gets his face smashed in with a spiked stick and its so gross me and my friend had to rewind it about 20 times. I was so enthralled by this film that i wanted to know more about the thinking and thought processes behind it. So i watched 'Dinner with Uwe Boll' but i couldn't tell what they were eating. I then listened to Uwe Boll commentary and i think he said that the Bloodrayne game was set in world war 2, which didn't ring a bell with me so i might have been thinking of a different game. But the film was more about the game i'm thinking of than the one he was talking about so i still give this film 10 out of 10.",

How come I can't stomach that film, but want to watch this one over and over again? The answer is in the acting. Bloodrayne has a number of famous actors. Does this mean the acting is good? No. But it's not bad either. It's terrible! The performances of all the actors turn Bloodrayne into a true trainwreck of a film: it's so terrible you can't avert your eyes.Oscar winner Ben Kingsley speaks in an eloquent, Shakespearian monotone. I've never seen such a bizarre performance, before or since. Michael Madsen convincingly portrays a man slowly dying of boredom. Michelle Rodriguez's British accent is so bad that even she is pissed about it. Kristanna Loken, veteran of Mortal Kombat Conquest, exhausts all of her acting chops on moaning. Billy Zane delivers some of the hammiest snooty acting I've ever seen, and I love it. Meat Loaf is truly a horror to behold, in every possible way.The rest of the movie is firmly within SyFy Channel Original movie territory. The CGI and practical effects are terrible despite the Hollywood budget. The costumes could easily have been stolen from the closets of trendy cosplayers of the early 2000s. Romania affords one or two interesting film locations, but most of this looks like a TV set.I highly recommend Bloodrayne to fans of movies like the Room.

I had already seen all the movies I wanted to (eagerly awaiting Underworld: Evolution) so she took me to see Bloodrayne. Her friend, and little sister accompanied us. Let me put it this way, the three of them fell asleep and I managed to remain awake (miraculously). Those who like clunky battle scenes, repulsively outlandish sex scenes, and flat characters would find this a little entertaining, but not for longer than 5 minutes. It rivals the Fantastic Four in terms of lazy scriptwriting.Lets start with the emotional content, which was not even there to be seen. There just wasn't enough to connect me (the audience) to the characters. Rayne's mother was seen once, but it lacked narrative thrust. And Sebastian's parents (his reason of torment) was mentioned one time, but he lacked the facial expressions and dialogue to show us that this was a serious conflict in his soul. Yeah, nonexistent. The weird thing was that it didn't feel like the actor's performance is what lacked, I genuinely got the impression that they were given this poorly conceived dialogue and motivation and a slap on the back saying, \"good luck.\" I don't care how good an actor you are; if your lines suck, and your director wants you to stick to them, what can you do? The action scenes, plain and simple, lacked energy. Not much else to say about them. The choreography was weak and slow. A sword the length of your arm does not weigh as much as a claymore, sorry. But even given the time period the story was badly rooted in, the could've made the sword fighting more dramatic. Or at least faster. And the terrible blending of slow-mo and fast-mo (less frames per second to make the movements seem faster) kept me wondering what exactly the director thought of his movie.And the climax of the whole movie, no taste what-so-ever. Batman and Robin was better than this. It was a giant bloodbath, to start. I know blood gives the audience some realism, but this is just overkill. You could fill the Grand Canyon with the amount of blood used in the film. *SPOILER ALERT* And, oh no, your lover dies, you're surrounded by dead bodies, you've killed your own father *which is what you wanted* and there's no further reason for your existence, what do you do? Walk slowly across the hall and sit in a chair as the camera pushes in uncomfortably on your face until he FINALLY says \"cut.\" Yeah, believable, sure, NOT. *END OF SPOILER* But in the long run I can't say it was that bad, because I've never played the games. This movie will be a much bigger disaster for fans of the game, and my sympathies go out to them.Say what you want about George Lucas' ability to write bad dialogue, at least he had some passion for the topic of his script.

And why did she lose her sanity that one time and attack her friend, but not anybody else for the rest of the movie? The vampire palace in the middle of the movie was disturbing as well as confusing.

More expression, please! You're almost as bad as Christopher Hayden in \"Attack of the Clones\"! And just what exactly was meant by that creepy smile at the very end of the movie? The problem wasn't just Loken. Michelle Rodriguez had a similar problem. I did not find her character at all convincing, but rather an emotionless antisocial who unsurprisingly goes over to the other side for reasons I still can't quite fathom.

And yes, I bet it will.The story could have truly been good. The actors were top shelf. The sets and scenery were all fairly good. It was just such utter bleakness from the directorial point of view- even the one oddly contrived sex scene was botched. I can just picture the director's comments 'Okay now! Make the door slam more! Go for the squeak! Make it squeak!' I truly feel poorly for the actors convinced to do this film. May Hollywood forgive and forget and never let Boll rise up to plague us again. That's a horror all onto its self.",

Some scenes can make you laugh (despite the intention of the filmmaker), other shots are good, aerial ones for example. Others are a joke. Acting can go from decent to terrible. There is something that keeps me wondering and that is having people like Kingsley and Chaplin here. I think it is perfect for a group of young men, an afternoon with friends, having bowls of popcorn, screaming and laughing, if only to see Kristanna as Bloodrayne (there is also some -most welcomed- nudity). Still wondering what Ben Kingsley is doing here, maybe paying some bills? yeah, we all need to work for a living.",

The film contains great action sequences of sword fighting a spurting, and i do mean spurting, blood and guts. One thing we do learn from the opening credits is that Meatloaf Aday is in this film. And let me tell you this, he needs to stick to his singing! My only complaint, other than the horrible script and acting, was the ending, which obviously set up for a sequel.

Lots of blood and decaptations.But that doesn't really matter. This is a movie, and regardless of being an adaptation or not, it should be judged in its own merits.So how does it fare as a movie? A lot better than all of the people here are making it out to be. This is NOT a great, one in a lifetime experience. This is NOT something that I think you should go out of your way to watch it. This is just a fun little movie, that doesn't take itself too seriously, and provides some good action, and decent acting and effects for what it is.

            "content": "I never expected anything great or smart or even coherent out of this. I went into it totally blind, wanting nothing more than a cheap and cheesy B-movie with lots of sex appeal and lots of blood and gore. And you know what? The film delivered! There are really only a couple of reasons to watch this film: for the incredible blood and gore effects (which are fantastic in the unrated cut, but incredibly subdued in the original theatrical version) and for Kristanna Lokken's performance, of which I am particularly fond of.This film has earned its name as one of the all-time worst films ever made for a few good reasons though. First and foremost, it has absolutely nothing to do with the original video game. The game pitted the titular dhampir against Nazis during WWII, to find some Atlantean artifact and fight monsters and vampires...this movie throws it all out the window and just has Rayne in the Dark Ages embarking in a simple revenge story. It does little-to-no justice to its source material. Even on its own merits, the film is hobbled together with seemingly-random scenes, some of which could have been cut entirely. The best that can be said is that the story is serviceable; it's coherent enough to follow the characters and the action, but it is riddled with plot holes, inconsistencies, and frivolous scenes.As far as the film itself goes, the single most redeeming value will be its photography; despite a few shaky-cam scenes, the camera work is pretty solid at times. Acting is atrocious; I read that Michael Madsen was drunk when they filmed this, and it shows. Michelle Rodriguez puts on her standard tough-girl act, Matthew Davis offers some horrid line delivery, Meat Loaf offers a strange and frivolous cameo, it's hard to take Billy Zane seriously in anything he does, and even Ben Kingsley shows weakness as a flat and emotionally-void villain. The only bright spots here will be Michael Pare and Kristanna Lokken, who still contributes to the pool of bad acting with some bad dialogue and some incredibly weak-looking fight choreography. I only give her a pass, partly because she offers some decent sex appeal here, but mostly because I like the expressions and her mannerisms as Rayne (much unlike Natassia Malthe, who does manage to be more physically appealing, but plays it so tough that she becomes unlikable). Writing is terrible across the board; lines are simple and stupid, and their deliveries are often weak. This production does have some really wicked blood and gore effects. Sets, props, and costumes generally get the job done, but aren't terribly great either. Special effects are pretty bad. Music is alright.As Uwe Boll's third video-game adaptation, he pretty much strikes out (and strangely, never does give up the game). Chances are that you may watch all his movies and find them \"so bad they're good,\" but most will just dismiss them as \"so bad they're bad.\" In the case of BloodRayne, it is indeed a bad film and a missed opportunity for making a quality game adaptation (somewhat redeemed with BloodRayne: The Third Reich, but even that's pretty trashy). As it is, BloodRayne comes down as one of my ultimate choices for a guilty pleasure, since it is rather entertaining with its frivolous sex and violence, but most other viewers will not be so easily appeased.2.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Poor | Film: Very Poor)",

Somehow he continually conjures money in extreme sums to make some of the worst movies the world has ever seen, and when he's finished, there's always somebody else waiting to give him more for his next project. Bloodrayne cost $25 mill. His next, Dungeon Siege, cost $60 mill. Who keeps giving this guy cash? Bloodrayne stars one hit wonder, Kristanna Loken (of T3 fame) as, well, Bloodrayne, a half vampire, half human hot-chick floating about a (presumably, although I don't know for sure) fantasy land. She has to save the world from eternal damnation by...doing something. To be honest, the plot is so ill-conceived that I lost interest and only kept watching to see how bad it actually got. Michael Madsen forgets all the good work he done on Kill Bill Vol. 2 and reverts back to acting so wooden it makes Chuck Norris look like an Oscar candidate. Michelle Rodriguez ponce's around delivering her lines with the same conviction as an after dinner mind would. Ben Kingsley. Wow. How the mighty fall from grace. From Oscar gold in Ghandi to looking like and old man dressing in his grandmothers wig and clothes, his role is reduced to an embarrassing cameo. All in all, Bloodrayne doesn't really have that much going for it. Not even the bloody (and I mean bloody) battle scenes could hold my interest. That said, though, I know there will be a few of you out there, like myself, who will put themselves through torture just to say you survived another Dr Boll film.

I wanted to demand the video store for my money back and am personally glad that the Halo movie went to Peter Jackson (director of the lord of the rings trilogy) an not this thing that claims to be a director. how does he get any fans anyway. and who sponsors his movies anyway, it can only be people with no good movie tastes or people that only want to laugh more at his trash he calls movies. if u see this movie then u must agree with me. if not then don't rent or buy it, trust me its utter garbage",

But, that's somewhat a shame.A promising cast that had Kristanna Loken, Michael Madsen, Michelle Rodriguez and Ben Kinglsey only suffered from Boll's poor directing and the very static script.But where this movie becomes a movie that no Vampire or heck, even medieval era movie fan should miss.

And if it's not even acknowledged for a Razzie, I will be heartily disappointed.Props to Ewe Boll for his passionate film-making, he truly loves the work he does, even though most would say it's a passion he should abandon. He continues to put out movies that are consistently bad, and for that We should embrace him. Stop thinking along the lines of \"Ugh, Ewe Boll directed this.

Movies based on games are seldom that good, but this one actually had some relatively big name actors, and a plot that wasn't entirely contrived.However the acting was incredibly flat, and the dialog has that awkward feel that many \"period\" dramas have which is caused by the failure to use a contraction. Of course, even without that the lines feel like they were read off of cue cards. In fact the best acting performance of the bunch was delivered by Will Sanderson, a relative unknown (actually he gives a good performance). The second best performance is by Billy Zane who has a small role. Actually, the second best performance is given by the prostitutes surrounding Meat Loaf. They really do act like prostitutes.I point out the prostitutes because there is gratuitous nudity in this movie (which I find sadly lacking in many of the schlocky movies that have come out recently). There is even a gratuitous sex scene between Kristanna Loken and Matt Davis. It isn't just gratuitous, it has the feel of a scene that was shot for addition to the deleted scenes section of a DVD. The director will cleverly say the scene was cut because of \"pacing\". Or in this case because they couldn't figure out a way to segue into a sex scene. So instead she basically gets up in the middle of the night, strolls out of her jail cell and jumps his bones.There are numerous others parts of the movie where I was just scratching my head trying to figure out why the characters were doing what they were doing. It is one thing for the heroes to end up being saved by deux ex machina, but it is another thing entirely for the heroes to rely on it.On a final note, why make Michelle Rodriquez wear blue contacts? It doesn't improve her acting and only makes her look more out of place in the movie. All she does in this movie is skulk around and scowl.

His name should be on the front image of every single one of his movies' DVD releases. In bold. Probably in some kind of neon color. Maybe twice, just to make sure.This movie is just bad on so many levels. If you are looking for Tarantino-ish amounts of blood, look no further. But where Tarantino manages to overdose on the gore in a manner that makes you hoarse with laughter, Boll manages to actually make you want to curl up and cry yourself to sleep. The sheer terror.And the bad acting. Boll persistently manages to get big names to work on his films. The warm, lovable, peaceful image of Ben Kingsley as Ghandi will forever be tainted by his utter lack of facial muscles and the offensively bad hair styling in Bloodrayne.The bad lines. \"You are such a suck-up!\" Do I really need to say more? The movie tries (and, unsurprisingly, fails) to carry its lines in a cloak&dagger-ish manner, to be repeatedly interrupted by comments like the one mentioned. This even beats Ultraviolet's \"Are you mental?\".In a world of great injustice, of people dying by the thousands each moment, of a cloned human as the leader of one of its most powerful nations, and a tradition of blaming violence on video games and rock music, Uwe Boll will be allowed to continue to make awful movies.

            "review_title": "I think I'm done with Uwe Boll",
            "content": "Of the four Uwe Boll films I've seen, I think that this might be the worst. It's stiff competition, for sure, but there's something extra inept, amateurish, misguided, and unappealing about BloodRayne. All of Boll's staples are here from inexplicably unnatural dialogue to incredibly dull performances to incomprehensible action scenes to flat cinematography, it's all here, but the \"story\" of BloodRayne, an attempt at epic fantasy, is so overstuffed and undercooked by design that it's kind of unbelievable.There's so much to rag on here, but I want to focus the few precious minutes of my life I'm going to dedicate to thinking about what I hope to be the last Uwe Boll film I ever see on his complete inability to build a single character.Boll seems to believe that character traits, in his head and not actually on display in the film, are all you need. He doesn't need to show characters as brave, or strong, or loyal to someone, or villainous, or anything else. He just needs to explain it through a single line of dialogue and then the audience has all of the information they need. So, if one character calls another \"brave\", then that's all we're going to get in terms of the character's bravery. This manifests most frustratingly around the character of Katarin, played by Michelle Rodriguez. Katarin is described as loyal, but we never actually see her as so, so when she ends up betraying her friends and the protagonist, Rayne, it's not shocking. In fact, it leaves no impression whatsoever because Katarin was never a character but just a human shaped thing that spouted exposition from time to time. Her betrayal means nothing because Katarin isn't a character. She's so poorly drawn that her major act feels like nothing.This extends to every single character in the movie. From Rayne herself, whos' described as several things but never really manifests them, to Vladimir, played by Michael Madsen (obviously drunk and uncaring), to Kagan, played by Ben Kingsley who occasionally looks like he's alive as he flatly delivers lines.Moving on a bit, the world building in this fantasy epic is laughably bad. In fact, I have no idea how this world of vampires versus the world is supposed to work. There's a vampire kingdom, and a hidden anti-vampire resistance, and nothing in between. It sounds like vampires have the upper hand, but the way Kagan's plot is described it sounds like vampires are in the shadows (metaphorically) and will use a series of talismans to bring about world domination. Very little thought seemed to be put into this.And another thing...any time a fantasy movie calls its magical items \"talismans\", I role my eyes. It's a weirdly tinny and awkward word. It's not that the idea of a talisman is weird (the Ring in The Lord of the Rings is technically a talisman), but the literal use of the word in dialogue. It shows me laziness.I have to touch on one more thing before I wrap up this exercise in masochism. There's a scene early when Rayne finds one of the several talismans (the eye of...someone). She arrives at a monastery, gets free reign of the place, wanders into a small hallway with a monster sleeping on a chair at the far end. Now, this hallway is lit with braziers along the columns that line the space, but they don't actually light anything. It's obvious that the whole set is lit from large electronic lights above. Instead of giving the scene a horror-like feel with bare, sourced lighting that can have the added side effect of hiding some of the dodgy makeup on the monster, everything's clear as day, undermining any source of horror-based tension.Literally everything about this movie is laughably bad. From the lighting to the acting to the writing to the action, everything is bad. Hell, the sex scene has Rayne accidentally opening and closing a jail cell door repeatedly, and it's just left in, including the sound effects that were captured on set. It's a testament to Boll's skills as a conman that he got money for this movie at all, much less roping in someone like Ben Kingsley to play the villain. Boll is inept at every aspect of storytelling and filmmaking, and I think I'm done with him.",

Yeah - I don't think there would be any \"my companion seems to be missing - I do not know what has become of him!\" i hope they don't let this guy direct any more movies and ruin the careers and any other up-and-coming stars. sorry Kristanna - hope you pick a better movie next time.",

If you have the patience to watch it all the way through to the end (and I suggest having something else to do on the side to ease the pain) you'll just find yourself confused. Who is the lead character? Who is the bad guy? What era is this colossally bad flick supposed to be taking place in? And most importantly, who designed the women's costumes? It's early goth meets \"I'm having a fat day\" clothing. What a mess! The only redeeming thing about this is that there are some great actors in it doing a really bad job. How is this redeeming? Well, because I have a sick sense of humour and it makes me feel kinda good to know that the extraordinary Ben Kingsley and always amusing Michael Madsen do crappy work too. Perhaps they needed to pay for the summer home, buy another horse... who knows? But nobody chose this puppy for the script.If you get bored watching the film (and you will) a fun way to pass the time is to try and figure out what accent Michelle Rodriguez is attempting. She varies from sounding like a 100% west coast American to a tape player with the batteries running out.This is fun to watch with people who like to heckle. And while drinking.

            "content": "I was supremely disappointed by the casting choice of the main character in this film. I had hoped it would be okay before I began watching the movie, but within the first ten minutes, I was thinking to myself \"Why on earth did they cast such an awful actress in this emotional part?\" Her tearful cries are far from heartbreaking--in fact, I'd say they're more eardrum-breaking if you get what I'm saying. She sounds like a cat doing an impression of a dog drowning in chocolate sauce. A really bad impression.After she's done screaming and writhing in obviously-fake emotional pain, the movie gets slightly better. The rest of the acting (with the exception of Michelle Rodriguez, who has only ever played one good role, Rain in \"Resident Evil\") is pretty good, but obviously low-budget and not top-notch. The acting is really my main concern.Visually, this movie is reasonably gorgeous. The cinematography isn't very impressive, but it's better then some I've seen, and the camera quality is superb on my 38in TV. The graphics look good, and the stunts are well done, but the blood looks really fake and ruined the moment a few times. The story is fairly true to the video games, but isn't nearly as satisfying. Rayne kicks a lot less ass in this film then she does in the games. A lot. I blame that on Kristianna. Moving on... The set design is quite satisfying, and the costumes are acceptable if not good.This movie is FAR BETTER then the last movie I watched, which was \"The Wickerman\" starring Nicolas Cage. Sad, isn't it? Someone should redo this film with a better cast and a bigger budget, and then maybe it'd be okay. For now, though, I'm saying stay away unless you love BloodRayne or not-that-great, B-grade movies. If you just like vampires, not b-grade movies or video games, don't bother.",

I really liked it and was laughing more than usual for garbage of this grade and vintage. I guess I've got a soft spot for Boll, because I also really liked \"House of the Dead,\" which is equally juvenile, clich\u00e9d, and craptacular. However, this Director's cut edition of \"Bloodrayne\" had way more gore and a lot of it was pretty well done, thus earning an extra half star. If you like bad movies, Boll's ouvre is one to visit. He makes stupid, clich\u00e9d, hammy trash that just might grow a little on you...if you let it. Boll is a hack and he knows it. We know it, too, so people need to get over bashing the guy. He sucks as a director, yes. BUT THAT IS THE POINT. He makes a movie called \"Bloodrayne,\" that is based on a crappy PS2 game. Duh! Um...sorry about that little rant there.

I didn't know about this until after i watched the movie so I'll just give you the rundown of how i thought the movie went along. I thought that the dialog was poorly written, yet sometimes well executed. The story had more holes than a cheese grater and enough cheese to boot. Now, my expectations have been low for video game movies since the likes of Mario Bros and Doom. But this didn't even meet my low expectations. The use of gore didn't seem to have any other purpose other than to be there which... if this were some sort of horror flick... would have been fine. But it just seemed laughable. As in me and my family were laughing. It looked ridiculous. The problem is it's not even bad enough to be good. it's not a so bad it's good. or so indie it's good. this is a movie that is so bad it's horrendous. don't even waste your money.that's three strike Mr. Boll. in my books... you're out.

            "content": "Based upon a computer game of the same title, BloodRayne is set in the eighteenth century Romania. Trapped in a travelling circus, Ranye is a dhampir; a half human half vampire, offspring to Kagan. Escaping from the circus, Rayne sets to kill Kagan, who killed her mother. Joining her cause to destroy Kagan, vampire hunters Sebastian and Vladimir help her cause.Director Uwe Boll has gathered a cult following; but not in the positive sense. Uwe has critically and publicly classified as one of the worst directors of all time; which the title is currently held by Ed Wood. Uwe has been acclaimed for churning out computer games based films of very low quality; House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark, with more to come. BloodRayne is my first taste of a Uwe Boll film, and the hype surrounding Uwe seems to hold merit.With a film of this standard, it's not about finding its faults, it's about finding its redeeming facets. Sadly there isn't much nice things to say. The dialog and plotting of the script is so emaciated and blunt. It's sporadic, never keeping a cohesive story arc. Plot holes and inconsistencies are deep crevasses. Characters are broadly drawn in one single stroke, paper thin and uninteresting. Being based upon a computer game, the film is stuck in game mode, with situations that run much like a game and constant run of fights, with badly choreographed \"swords play\" and \"martial arts\", if you could call them that. Though a film can have dodgy action scenes, though Uwe's direction and bad editing make all the actors look like their slapping each other while having seizures and throwing buckets of blood around; I actually think they were.In a ditch to add something of value, Uwe has jumped to the last resort; the T&A factor. With naked women as Leonid's concubines, with the odd beaver shot, it just makes you wonder even more if it can sink any lower to spark interest. Though the amazing part is an out of the blue, most hysterical inducing sex scene; not even the bubbling pool scene from Showgirls makes you laugh this hard. I don't know if it's the sheer spontaneity of it all or the clunking, banging sound of the cell door.The most disappointing part of BloodRayne is the cast. With semi strong names Kristanna Loken, Michelle Rodriguez, Michael Madsen, Matthew Davis to a lesser extent, all deliver such comatose performance. They're not even acting, just reading some ill written lines. Though most disappointing is Ben Kingsley. It's hard to understand how an Academy Awarding winning actor could give so way under par.Maybe if BloodRayne had some camp value it might have been enjoyable, but there isn't enough camp value to save this.",

            "content": "Hollywood has a really corny way of telling the story. O.K., you've got your Romanian vampires (duh!), a tyrannic father for Rayne (maybe some counseling would help) who wants to conquer the world, but first, he must kill his daughter (if she won't join him -> \"Luke, I am your father\").About Rayne, she's being held captive by Gypsies who exploit her weakness toward water and her ability to regenerate after consuming blood (do they even know she's a vampire ?) and everything seems to be O.K. for her, until one of them tries to rape her (the films' main event seems to be rape - Kagan raped her mom, that dude tried to rape her, but not long after that she ends up having wild sex with somebody that was depriving her of some people rights too)so then, she realizes that she must kill her father (and all the vampires as well).I would really like to talk with the guy that wrote the script, cause he doesn't seem to know much about the game (or vampires, for that matter):1. Rayne and Water don't mix (she takes the eye of Beliar in her and so she doesn't take damage from water - that's crap!In the game, when that happens, she gains extruded view, not to mention the action takes place in Argentina !)2. When did vampires start having sex and furthermore - having kids ?!OK, this is the part that bothers me the most. So, Rayne is very hungry,because she hasn't been feeding for the last days, she exits her cage, she's about to feed on the guy (that would've been more fun and realistic), but instead, she settles out for a roll in the hey. Man, I know you've got to make a living, but did you ever think about what the gamers would think ? Yeah, Kristana is pretty hot, but if I wanted to get some action , I would have watched something else (don't want to mention here)3. The action of the game begins in New Orleans, but as many \"horror writers\" , the \"scripter\" places the action in Romania - long live Bram Stoker !4. Where did all the characters in the movie came from ? Except for Kagan and a slight imitation of Mince, there is no resemblance to the actual characters in the game.5. Kristanna Loken and Blood Rayne don't actually look like, except for the costume (and by the way, she should've lost some more weight on the belly and the thies)I am really looking forward to see what the other gamers feel about what I've said here.",

            "content": "Although I checked the spoiler warning, I don't think it is much of a shock that lots of people die in a movie called BloodRayne. But in a movie with blood in the title, the fight scenes are so completely unrealistic that there is virtually no fright, terror, or even interest in the battle scenes, which often are disturbing only for the constantly shaking camera, which vainly tries to add interest to this movie.This movie would be dull even as a video game where a player controlled Rayne, a dhampir (a half-human, half-vampire), who goes on a mission of vengeance (is there any other kind?) to kill her father Kagan, the most powerful vampire in the area. In between orgiastic feasts of sex and blood, Rayne joins the Brimstone Society, a group of rebel committed to fighting Kagan, who is searching for three magical talismans that will summon forth an all-powerful vampire.The actors clearly know this will bomb, but it's shocking that Michael Madsen and Ben Kingsley both decided to sign onto this sinking ship. Madsen looks lazy in his sword fighting (very unlike Kill Bill) and shows virtually no emotion as the leader of the Brimstone Society. Kingsley is somewhat creepy as Kagan but it is a waste of his talent.Story and character development are virtually non existent (the movie could have been OK had any effort been put into developing more of a focus on the Brimstone Society), and the bloodletting is so unrealistic as slashes release gallons of blood. Mercifully, the movie is about an hour-and-a-half.Not being a devotee of this genre, perhaps there is something good in BloodRayne (other than Kristanna Loken, who gets 4 points on her own, but loses two for tying her hair in a bun before the final battle). However, I don't think \"His movies cured much insomnia\" is something Uwe Boll would like to see on his tombstone.",

There is nothing more to it, and you get exactly what you would expect here.The story in \"BloodRayne\" is about Rayne (played by Kristanna Loken), a dhampir (half human, half vampire) living in humiliation in a traveling carnival. When a blood-lust consumes her, she escapes at the cost of several carnival members. Now free from captivity, Rayne sets out to find and kill the vampire that killed her mother.Right, well, at least it is a storyline so simple that everyone can follow it. And the simplicity of the storyline also prevents the audience to be thrown any plot twists or surprises. Yes, this is as scripted and generic as it can be.What does work in favor of \"BloodRayne\" is the cast ensemble, as they did have some fairly familiar names and faces here. The cast included Kristanna Loken, Michael Madsen, Udo Kier, Billy Zane, Michelle Rodriguez and Ben Kingsley. So in that aspect they did have some big enough names to the cast list. How they managed to recruit them for a project such as this is just beyond my comprehension.Aside from a very scripted storyline, then the action sequences in the movie were rigid and poorly executed. It was toe-curling to watch Kristanna Loken trying to pass as skilled with two blades. The only one whom did manage to put on a convincing performance in the fight sequences was Michelle Rodriguez.\"BloodRayne\" is essentially one of those movies that came from a computer game that should never have seen the light of day, as the transition to movie was just awful. This is the type of movie that you watch once, then bag and tag it, most likely never to watch it ever again.",

Udo Kier, Billy Zane and Meat Loaf also appear.I usually try to stay away from Uwe Boll films, which are notoriously awful. This one is no exception, considered by many to be one of the 100 worst films ever made (though somehow good enough to warrant a Boll-directed sequel in the Old West). But on the day I watched it I craved a horror film (and White Castle) and this was the only one available. Feel free to have pity on me (and send me White Castle).What bothers me is that this should have been a good movie. The cast is incredible (Ben Kingsley? Michael Madsen? Billy Zane? Udo Kier?) with the exception of Michelle Rodriguez, who I could speak epithets about for hours. The writing seems respectable, as there is plot development, character depth and an overall decent story to be found here with a rich mythology. But the train crashes on the way to the station.The dialog is really bad. The conversations themselves are probably okay, but the way they are delivered is just too much like theater. Maybe talking like Shakespeare works for \"Hamlet\", but it doesn't work in a vampire film. It makes everyone look inexperienced, despite some of these people being seasoned, award-winning actors.The directing and composition are also just plain bad. Flashbacks are put in at inappropriate times (you don't need to show us the attack on Rayne's mother every twenty minutes) and the actions was directed as a cross between an action film, a comedy and a martial arts exploitation film. I enjoy excessive blood, but there's a right way and a wrong way to do it. The way it's done here is reminiscent of \"Kill Bill\", and not in a good way. A sword slash on the chest will not release a geyser of crimson Kool-Aid. My bloodlust isn't satiated by such comical displays.My bet is if you remake this film with a different director but the exact same script, you could get a film that is praised and admired by genre fans. As I've said, the plot was good. There's plenty of action, and a good spin on the classic vampire story (as well as the timeless revenge story). The only thing this film really had going for it was a decent sex scene, which is hardly enough to give it a positive review (though Loken is beautiful and will be missed in the sequel).Don't see this film, unless you want a really bad film to annoy you during a drinking expedition. I'm pleased that I had a tall whiskey to help me through this. Apart from the small role filled by Billy Zane (whose acting is cheesy, but in an endearing way) I have no love for this film.

Bloodrayne, on the other hand, sees the director at his worst, the film proving virtually unwatchable despite an impressive supporting cast (Michael Madsen, Michelle Rodriguez, Billy Zane, Ben Kingsley, Udo Kier, Meat Loaf, Michael Par\u00e9), gore effects by German splatter-meister Olaf Ittenbach, and a gratuitous topless scene from its sexy star Kristanna Loken.Loken plays a half-vampire/half-human pair of breasts called Bloodrayne, who, with the help of a group of vampire slayers, seeks revenge on Kagan (Kingsley), the bloodsucking fiend who raped and killed her mother. This simplistic plot is told in such a convoluted manner that it soon becomes virtually incomprehensible. Boll commands wooden performances from all involved and employs a plethora of irritating, gimmicky film-making techniques, reducing Ittenbach's gore effects to blink-and-miss-it splashes of red (although the unrated director's cut shows much more of these in an end-of-movie montage), rendering the action dull and lifeless, and obscuring Loken's butt with a table during her sex scene.This terrible film has since spawned two sequels (Loken wisely handing over her role to Natassia Malthe), both courtesy of Boll, and both of which have terrible ratings on IMDb. Can't say that I'm very surprised.2.5/10, very generously rounded up to 3 for the OTT splatter in the Unrated version.",

All day I had been looking forward to the release of this glorious display of cinematic creativity, and I was sure to inform everybody I knew. You see, we had been there at the opening of \"Alone In The Dark,\" and afterward we were all hardcore fans. After watching \"House Of The Dead\" shortly afterward, we all wondered how that one had slipped passed us when it had been showing in theaters.Unfortunately for me and my celebrating crew, disaster struck; the movie wasn't playing anywhere nearby. In fact, the closest location was Marysville, Washington, a city about 100 miles south of the one in which we all call our home. It was then that we knew what we had to do. We all drove into (our) town separately and parked our cars, meeting up at about 8:30 in the evening. That left us with an hour and fifteen minutes to cover the distance. Tragically, the man we chose to be driver (his driving skills far surpass our own) was unable to get off work. Thinking quickly, we bribed his manager and were on our way by 8:45.Down the freeway we raced, stopping only briefly for gas. Praying that there were no police in the vicinity, we averaged about 100 miles per hour as we sped passed car and truck alike. \"I'm gonna be all kinds of angry if we die before we get to this movie,\" I shouted over the horrible clanking of his rapidly disintegrating engine, \"And what in God's name is that noise.\" The car was shaking violently, but we all knew the risks.At long last we pulled into to parking lot and raced inside. After buying tickets and popcorn, we made it into the theater just in time to see the preview for his next film: \"In The Name Of The King.\" It was then that we knew that this tradition of ours would resume in the coming winter. That was a thought for a later time, however. We sat down and spent the next hour and a half enjoying the underrated brilliance of a particular German director.",

But most amazingly, Ben Kingsley has the role of the ubervampire. I know he is old and all, but what did he expect to get from this movie? Long last acting recognition? I thought Will Sanderson made a good role, even if a small one, but after his 34 movies and TV appearances he should, anyway.OK, putting Kristanna Loken in action sequences with swords doesn't really pay off. She is an athletic woman, but can't really move heavy metal things. The fights are all a bit confusing and not very realistic, but at least they are not full of fake CGI, which is a plus. This is a bloody movie, but it doesn't really show more than red dye, there are no severed limbs or visible internal organs. Also, not all the good guys survive, which is a nice change from the routine.Bottom line: it was way more than I expected and did a hell lot more from the tiny budget it had than a lot of high budget crappy monster movies.

I don't have to tell that this cast is one of the best I have seen in these kinds of movies. So here is the general idea: Mr. Boll (avant-garde director extraordinare) wanted so much to make this movie, oh it was his childhood dream. Collected some of the most talented and acclaimed actors (and some opposite of that) and made this terrible film. But This is not even a film, because films have a plot, have actors. A plot is something that makes you at least stay awake, an actor is somebody who knows his/her role. I don't want to tell that fi. Maidsen isn't an actor, but he is playing this one worse than Steven Seagal usually plays, who would had been a better choice as having a practice in playing such horrible parts (And Maidsen proved he is a good actor as Mr. Blonde). The others, I don't even wan't to mention them, I truly don't want to think at some of my favorite actors as jerks in gigalol costumes. It really seems that they where so frustrated, they allied to make a complete joke out of their roles, or this is how they protested? I wonder how they where lured to star in this movie (a free trip to Romania?) Bottom line: How is he doing it? How can he get a contract for a movie? Who gives him money? Yes I'm referring to Mr. Boll. David Lynch is fighting for money to make genial movies and this little piece of s*it is getting money for great titles like Alone in the dark. The only logical explanation I could find is, that he is making video game based movies. You read in the papers that a horrible picture was made and it is a shame to the (also not genial) game. So you think if you wasted $10 for the ticket or the rental, you should really try the game only to find out it is better than this movie.Sorry, I'm really diffuse here at the ending, but I can't concentrate. Recalling this movie had killed my brain-cells, I can't type... ...DON'T W.. H.AT..CH I.TTTTT!

Oh, and I was amazed to see Meat Loaf's name in the credits too. Then again, I may have been so bored and apathetic about this movie that I didn't even notice he was in it. The dumbest aspect is probably how the vampires are weak against water. Yes, any water of any kind.It's so stupid because they actually reference holy water which is supposed to be the vampires' weakness. So what is the purpose of holy water? Like \"Alone In The Dark\" there are these two characters that meet for a minute and then they start having sex. Even worse, the film has one of the most insane endings ever. The last part is literally four minutes of the main character sitting in a chair and having flashbacks to the rest of the movie. Oh yeah, flashbacks were a noticeable mess in \"House Of The Dead\". I stand corrected. THOSE are more of the dumb things recognizable in Boll's movies. *",

The acting, even from three well known actors couldn't lift this movie from stilted, un-involving performances that seemed to be read, not acted. The editing was choppy. The pacing was uneven. The script was not very inspiring, loaded with copied stereotypes. The production value was decent enough, the script outline had potential but the execution failed to deliver. There was no investment in making this movie passionate and the attempt to hold onto the audience's interest with background sound effects, intense battle scenes just fell flat.

            "content": "First off I am going to start my review by stating that I Don't HATE UWE BOLL and going into this movie I wasn't looking for every way to go OH MY BOLL YOU DID THAT WRONG! I went into this movie wanting to kill 90 minutes of my day. Now I saw this in its third week and I was the only one in the theater. Now this theater for American Films is never busy so one person there I would say is like 5 at a normal Loews or UA theater. So off to the review. I have been reading that people say the acting is terrible and all of that and the script is lousy. Well I don't think the acting is all that bad. Now its it Oscar. HELL NO! Is it even something a 5 yr old would go WOW thats good acting. HELL NO! This is just normal acting that Kingsley or a lesser known actor could have done, not a person off the street because its still acting. I think from other peoples reviews that the acting is under what people are saying. Second topic is how the film is cut and edited, I will include the sex scene for this film. Since HOTD Boll has gotten 100x better and this film flows a lot better then AOTD. Now it still has random scenes but it flows like a \"real\" film. The sex scene is good and it made my happy but I think its not as great as everyone is saying. Overall its not a bad job all in all. Action is probably where this film kind of got me going hmmm. Now AITD and HOTD aren't good films at all but they had some decent action. BloodRayne in every aspect is Bolls best film except the action. I think the gore is good and he doesn't prolong it which is good also but nothing really excited me except for the beginning with the flashbacks. I think overall Boll went down a point in action but its classier and better fitting before. Overall this is definitely Bolls third best film(after Heart of America and Blackwoods if you ask me) but in the recent Boll era this is about .5 better then HOTD and 2 points better then AITD. I don't love/hate this film but it gave me what I wanted gore, action, and nudity and for that I am thankfulOn a side note the next Boll film does look like a LOTR rip but at the same time looks actually decent and a film I would see if I didn't like bad films or films that bomb at the Box Office. A second film with all the sword fighting should be good and improve from this and it doesn't look ordinary corny like the others. I would say it got me interested but not enthused. Well next film I will be seeing is Annapolis.",

            "content": "At that point in time, the master of direction that is Uwe Boll had already conceived two video game adaptations that were critically panned. His third attempt was no different. Now, I've not played the video game that this film is based on, but have seen footage and am aware of its gameplay style. Aside from the sheer amount of gore and improvised action sequences, it pretty much neglects its source material (whoa...shock!). Rayne, a cross-breed of human and vampire, joins a society that hunts down vampires so that she can kill the Vampire King who raped and killed her mother. A simple revenge plot with supernatural aesthetics, except her vengeance was dull and the vampires were weaker than outdated holy water. I have to give some praise to Boll, who does stick to a gothic style of some sort that makes this film have an identity. Sure, it's generically medieval and you shan't remember anything the next day, but it does the job. That's about all the praise I can give it. Boll is unable to direct his A-list cast, and they are able to overpower him by doing the bare minimal. Madsen literally didn't give a toss. Kingsley was thinking \"hmmm what other bad film can I be in?\" (which turns out to be 'The Love Guru'). Rodriguez, Zane and Chaplin were all just pointless. Loken actually gave the acting a go, my advice would be to give up now. And Meat Loaf, well...that entire scene was all kinds of messed up. Boll actually hired prostitutes instead of extras, he was probably thinking \"I must release my inner Hitchcock! Meat Loaf, sign this contract stating that if you get a STD that it is not my fault!\". The screenplay had no characterisation. The plot was one-dimensional and unsurprisingly lost focus many times. No seriously, there's a complete ten minute scene where she activate a booby trap and all of a sudden a quest to find three body parts commences. Basically, it's another cheap-looking TV movie that once again has a decent budget gone to waste. Boll should just not be given any money to waste...",

            "review_title": "To all Bloodrayne fans, please read the following",
            "content": "Please forgive me for the harsh review, but you will understand this if you are fan of the game or good movies in general. This movie receives a 1 out of 10 from me for the following: 1) Storyline, plot, and characterizations of Rayne, Kagan, and the Brimstone society were poorly done. For being a prequel, this movie really did lose any sense of what the video-games were about. If the writer would have played the games, got an understanding of what Bloodrayne was about, then the background information and plot would have been more correctly told and portrayed. The plot was not well-put together. The story should have stayed near the consistency with the game, not trying to make a prequel. I feel that was a bad part in the first place.2) Actor portrayals of the characters were NOT convincing. The actors/actresses really seem to be acting half-heartedly. Upon reviewing the characters and the actors/actresses portraying them, I feel that the casting was not right. Even though I am fan of the actors/actresses in this film, I just don't feel this was a good film with some of their previous roles that they have engaged in. Brings a good question, how did Uwe Boll get some of these well-known actors/actresses to act in his films? The point is the casting could have been better. Rayne should have oozed with sensuality, with the confidence of a trained assassin, like Selena in Underworld or Alice from Resident Evil. Both characters were portrayed with a confidence, Kate Beckinsale and Milla Jovovich making the roles as believable as they could. Each word said, each punch punched, each gun fired, every blade swung, looked and felt real or believable. This film needed that...it felt like Kristanna Loken was holding back and unsure of herself.3) The lighting and camera angles in this film was consistent with Uwe Boll's other films. This is very unfortunate, as the setting and plot are completely stripped away of any effect that could have been created. For example, would Underworld have been such a good movie if it was all done with bright hues and showing characters in sunlight, brightly lit rooms, etc? No, the movie was supposed to be dark and broody, gave the sense of eeriness and the supernatural. This sets up the mood, makes the characters dark and mysterious, makes the costumes appear more sensual or realistic. The cinematographer should have known that or tried to achieve that. But, it's not entirely his fault as the director should have been pushing that more. ~sigh~ This should have been a SCI-FI channel movie, instead of a theatrical affair.4) The props and action scenes in this movie would have been done better by a high school drama club. Aluminum swords, costumes not even worthy to be able a comic-book convention, and over use of nudity, bloody, and gore really took away from making this convincing. It was so disconcerting. Point of a good movie is to make the audience feel they are part of the movie, bringing to life another world. The action scenes focused entirely on the blood and gore, Kristanna Loken and the others looked unconvincing in any the scenes. The choreography was not even second-rate, it was one of the worst. ( With the exception of the unknown-monk in a particular scene that really knew what he was doing.) Other than that, it's the usual Uwe Boll style of emphasizing on blood and gore and not enough on the story, plot, and connecting the action scenes together properly.5) The music in this movie was not bad, but the music NEVER stopped or felt were scored or unneeded in a scene. Even my friends and family that watched this movie was aggravated at the music was nonstop and commenting on how the music just didn't fit the mood of the scenes.6) The death knell of any future movie franchises for Bloodrayne. With a character that could rival Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Blade, this could have been a very successful franchise for Majesco and the studio that produced this film. Such a disappointment that this will more than likely end any future endeavors that Bloodrayne could have had. Majesco should have held off and did their research, for example, Blizzard Entertainment recently found a studio for their product Warcraft. Warcraft has been around for nearly 10 or so years. It has taken Blizzard that long to find the correct studio they feel will do their product justice. I guarantee you that the Warcraft movie will be very well-done, making the Warcraft franchise even bigger and open up to future films. This should have been the case for Bloodrayne, but sadly...I am a big fan of good cult-cheese movies, like Army of Darkness or Killer Klownz from Outer Space. This is doesn't even qualify as good cheese...it was that disappointing.Out of my enjoyment of the game was the only reason I forced myself to watch this. Play the game, enjoy the story, the characterizations in the game are great. Just this video-game-made-movie, even in terms of a regular movie, was not worth the time that I spent watching.",

(unless you count the vampire fangs and some blood as special effects). The script? (wait, you're right, there was no script). The not-at-all exciting and badly choreographed fighting sequences? The bad acting from almost everyone involved? (Michelle Rodriguez is barely OK and Billy Zane has 1-2 minutes in the movie, and he's half-decent, but that's it.)All in all, it was like a feature-length episode of Xena Warrior Princess, only with vampires, a more famous cast, and much worse in every other aspect. At least, Xena was honest about what the show was all about (and it was much better shot). What a waste of a decent cast.

            "content": "because I need to get the last hour and a half of my life back. Seriously. But let me tell you what happened approximately 90 minutes earlier. My boyfriend and I were deciding what movie to see: Brokeback Mountain (my vote more than his) and Bloodrayne. I know I know, after reading the reviews, it was a no-brainer, right? However, I read the synopsis, and I go a little weak in the knees for a female heroine in tight leather kicking every inch of male ass within forty feet. I can't help myself. So I wanted to see it. I mean hey, the critics can be harsh from time to time, and even though I knew Uwe directed \"Alone in the Dark\" (Tara Reid might have been a nice welcome in Bloodrayne, which is saying a lot) I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. I wanted to say hey, maybe he was able to do something with an existing story about a vampire human girl who wants bloodthirsty revenge. Sigh. Sadly, I was mistaken. This was nothing more than a directer trying to get his rocks off by a gratuitous sex scene (which I'll get to in a minute) and guys in tights and Halloween costumes battling it out or \"sharpening their sword\" or phallic shaped symbol in which they use to pierce vampires' hearts (hello? Have they heard of vamp myth? Where is the stake? Vamps are killed by scary splinters! Get the mythology right at least). Either way, within the first few minutes of this yawner, I was thinking about what I could've bought with my seven bucks. Two lattes at Starbucks, a nice lunch, my sanity back, maybe have my eyeballs removed because they were so shocked at what they were seeing. But oh. The sex scene. I know. Let's start out with Rayne slumbering away on her nice haystack and awaken, groggy and horny, wanting desperately to quench her cockthirst with Sebastian, a quaint brimstone who always does the right thing. Let me come up behind him, be the dominant one, and push him against some dirty steel bars, go for his neck (maybe he would've let me have one taste) have him utter some helpless \"no no...\" (would Fabien have done that? I think not!) until he can't help himself against my animal vampire thrall, and I will go to town for the next 1,000 years as the humping and moaning just drone on and on and on and on...and oh yeah, was this scene supposed to have a point? If Uwe wanted an excuse for soft core porn, maybe he could sign a deal with Showtime. Either way, despite decent performances by the Terminator chick, I feel it's dim times ahead when all she can do is prance naked and poke some freaks with a sharp stick. In all the gratuitous blood spattering, I must've slipped and fell asleep. This movie sucks, and I'm not talking about the vampires. This movie is UWEFUL and Mr. Boll should consider changing the spelling of his name to \"E W E.\" Get a job, move to Costa Rica, but by god man, please please please do not attempt to make another movie. I would much rather be alone in the dark of a theatre, than sit and watch another terrible bloodly flick rayne down under the guise of an actual film.",

            "content": "Once again, I find myself typing a review about a movie directed by the world's worst director, Uwe Boll. This man seems to have a sick pleasure in killing the reputations of great videogames. His past victims: Sega's House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark. Each of them cut down in their prime by this sociopath-of-a-director. But hey, Bloodrayne can't be all that bad. Uwe Boll can't POSSIBLY fail at life three times in a row. But wait, what's this? Bloodrayne is based in medieval times? Where's the Nazis? Where's the zombified evil . . .things? Where's the hot heavy-cleavaged half-vampire gamers know and love? Well, that settles it.Don't let the movie discourage you. \"Bloodrayne\" the video game was based, not in a crappy medieval setting, but during WWII. Rayne is the half human/vampire child created from a powerful vampire lord and an innocent woman, whom the vampire lord raped. The video game follows Rayne as she fights through the hordes of Nazi vampires and other abominations in order to face her father in a climactic showdown. Uwe Boll, apparently, thought that it wouldn't look good for a German director to direct a movie that based in Germany when Nazis were running around, so he took his reputation over that of the game and butchered whatever goodness the video game's plot had. However, I can't believe I'm saying this, this IS the only movie he's made that follows the plot structure of the game pretty well.Few people like Kristanna Loken anymore. She is in of some, no wait I mean, of A LOT of acting skills that doesn't consist of being a mindless talking mannequin with breasts. She's been in such flops as the remake to Shakespeare's famous \"Romero & Juliet\" and \"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\", and now, she's back as Rayne to make everyone laugh at how desperate she is for a good role. Hey, looks like Kate Beckinsale has a little friend :-). Anyway, there are also plenty of very famous actors in this film like Ben Kingsley and Michelle Rodriguez. I haven't seen much of Ben Kingsley, but I know that he makes for the WORST villain EVER! The vampire lord in the Bloodrayne video game was brutal, harsh, and loved to kill. The vampire lord, played by Ben, in the movie, however, is more like an aristocratic jerk who doesn't want to get his hands too dirty so he doesn't stain his sippy cup of blood. Michelle Rodriguez is actually a great actress, like in \"Million Dollar Baby\" and \"Resident Evil\", but Uwe Boll practically wipes his ass with her talent and makes her read off extremely bad dialogue, such as how do medieval Romanian nobodies know present day quotes like \"Keep your friends close and your enemies closer\" and \"If it's a fight they want, it's a fight they'll get\".The vampire special effects and make-up is HORRIBLE, and I say that in CAPS for a reason. Uwe Boll must have watched the early episodes \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" because ALL of the vampires look just like the vampires in the show. There is even one vampire that Rayne fights that has a completely dark green face for no reason whatsoever, but Uwe Boll must have said \"B-B-But he looks vicious and scary! I did it with my finger painting kit, so it has to be good. That's what my mom tells me!\" Soooooooo . . . yeah. Here's the positives about \"Bloodrayne\" the movie: . . . Michelle Rodriguez is in it. There's boobs. But even these can be achieved by watching \"Resident Evil\" instead. Now, for the negatives: Hmmm. Where do I start? Abysmal script, dialogue, acting from most actors, abysmal make up, props, fight scenes, the fact that Kristanna Loken is in, the fact that Uwe Boll directed it, and I would go on and on and on if I could, but IMDb's limit doesn't allow me to. It turns out that this . . . I don't want to call it a movie because I would insult every movie in film history . . . this pile of crap (there we go) is getting a sequel, directed by the same guy, but just like the first one, the sequel will probably only be in theaters for 2 weeks before getting itself sent back to Uwe's mother's house so she could put it on her wall as one of her son's 'masterpieces'.

Michael Madsen acts like he just stopped by to pick up his check and discovered that they wanted him to recite some lines. Ben Kingsley - what can I say.

Michelle Rodriguez - well she does tough-chick-with-an-attitude-trying-to-be-hot pretty well (it got her through \"Lost\") - I wonder if she can do anything else?? The plot is reasonable and flows pretty well and the photography is good (although we do seem to have an excess of mountain range scenery). The gore? Well, it's actually pretty funny.

Perhaps it was somewhere in the middle, but it was definitely not the film I was expecting. Maybe Uwe Boll is getting better, or maybe I'm becoming less harsh. I really didn't think this movie was terrible. At least not as terrible as other reviewers have lamented. That's not to say it's a masterpiece. First of all, this is nothing like the Bloodrayne video game. Instead of using the Bloodrayne storyline, they decide to rip off the plot of Castlevania 2. And while Castlevania 2 is probably my favorite video game ever, this does not do it justice. However, If the actors weren't totally hamming it up, this may have been a decent throwback to the days of Red Sonja (which also has a bad reputation). Sadly, I think the entire cast were there just for a paycheck and did not care how they looked on screen. And what a stellar cast it is though, regardless of what effort they may or may not have put forth. You've got Kristanna Loken as the titular character, Ben Kingsley, Michael Madsen, Matt Davis, Boll mainstay Will Sanderson, and Michelle Rodriguez. Even Michael Pare, Meat Loaf, Billy Zane and Udo Kier have bit parts. That is a great ensemble cast. With a cast like that, this movie should have been much bigger. It should have been a friggin' classic. I don't think it's as bad as people make it out to be, but it definitely feels generic. Like nobody cared to make it better. The dialogue is delivered horribly, the plot devices are very tacky (why did she deliver herself directly to the enemy with all the pieces needed to complete his diabolical scheme again?), and the fight choreography was just plain bad. It seems that the only people having fun on this shoot were the effects guys. The gore is certainly flying high in this picture and I enjoyed it for that alone.

In fact, there isn't one original concept in this whole mess.As a cheese-fest, however, the movie has some merit. Although every actor looks like they are reading the lines off cue-cards held out-of-shot, a rare treat is Meat Loaf. He can act OK (see Fight Club), so you have to believe he was deliberately hamming up his role in this turkey because he realised what a crock it was. Similarly, Ben Kingsley. Great actor, here reduced to staring fixedly into space in order to conjure menace. Perhaps Uwe had him drugged? Who knows? The single most hysterically funny thing about Bloodrayne, however, are the awfully dire gore effects. Every sword slash is accompanied by sprays of blood. Every limb severing (and there are lots), gets a lovely little fountain. Just how much pressure does the human circulatory system generate anyhow?

The lines were so stilted and monotone that at times I wondered if the actors were even in to it, or if they just wanted to get it over with. How far has Ben Kingsley fallen? Did he forget that he won an Oscar? And Michelle Rodriguez, has she been in a movie (or television show) where she didn't play the sulky, pouty, scowly part? What about the Sebastian guy-he reminded of a mulletted Stiffler-kind of like the role Seann William Scott had in Old School. Speaking of Sebastian, how tough can vampire killers be when they're named Vladimir and Sebastian. Aren't those Muppet characters? I won't bother to get into much more. Read other reviews for support of my ranting. One thing that I thought was really bad was the blood in the fight scenes. Whoever did the special effects must think that all people have tons of blood right at the surface of their skin and it's really pressurized. The spraying blood was so ridiculous that I couldn't even laugh at it, I was just mad that somebody was paid money to do that.So, please, if you haven't seen the movie, don't disregard this review, or the million others that say that this movie should be put out of its misery.",

            "content": "Oh, Uwe Boll.It's honestly a shame that he announced he's retiring from directing. ...no, seriously. I mean that. Yes, the man has essentially become the butt of many a joke online and is perhaps the most widely derided and ridiculed of minds in cinema in the last twenty years. And yes, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a part of that... indeed I was. I've written a number of cynical and dismissive reviews of his work. But I can't say that I don't admire the man to a certain extent. He's a passionate filmmaker and a man who loves his work- this much is evident. He wanted to be a director, and by god, he succeeded to at least some extent. And despite my negative comments, I think it's pretty evident that even when I didn't enjoy his work in its intended fashion, I still found great entertainment value in his catalog of films. I wouldn't be watching and discussing them still if I didn't. Granted, it was generally unintended comedic value, but still, I had great fun following his career. And I was always pleasantly surprised by the occasional flash of brilliance that would pop up here and there. So yes, I do think that it is a shame we may never again get to see an Uwe Boll film....but enough of that. Let's discuss \"BloodRayne\", shall we?One of Boll's earlier stinkers, 2005's \"BloodRayne\" was his third major theatrical release- at least counting his streak of wide-releases that started with \"House of the Dead\", and ignoring his earlier lower- budget roots. And coincidentally, it was also his third video-game to film adaptation, taking loose inspiration from the popular hack-and-slash action-adventure franchise of the same name. And while it is perhaps the most competent of his first fistfull of video-game movies, it's also a prime example of vintage-Boll insanity. Rife with nonsensical inconsistencies, amusing miscasting and plot-holes aplenty, it's definitely a very fun watch for fans of trashy, low- brow B-movies, and would make for a good \"movie night\" with a group of friends and lots of beer!Kristanna Loken stars as \"Rayne\", a half-human and half-vampire \"damphir\" who escapes from her life as a side-show freak and takes refuge with the Brimstone Society- a group of vampire hunters lead by Vladmir. (Michael Madsen) Together, they must stand up to a common enemy- Rayne's vile vampire lord father Kagen (Ben Kingsley), who seeks to take over the world using ancient artifacts that will grant him untold power.To give some credit where it is due, the film has a few inspired moments and some fun sequences that are uncommonly well-done in comparison to Boll's early work. While half-baked and far too abbreviated, the early sequences revolving around Rayne's exploitation at the hands of a circus freakshow are well-conceived and give a nice bit of sympathy to the character. There's a fun little sub-plot with singer/actor Meat Loaf Aday that comes unexpectedly and will provide a few minor beats of suspense. And Kingsley is a lot of fun to watch with his weirdly monotone yet oddly threatening take on a devious vampire lord.However, the rest of the film tends to fall flat on his face. Stars Loken, Madsen and an inexplicable Michaelle Rodriguez are all ludicrously miscast and seem in over their heads, leading to many unintended laughs. In particular Madsen, who I'm pretty sure is either heavily intoxicated or deathly tired in most of his scenes. He takes \"phoning it in\" to a whole new level. The action set-pieces are cringe-worthy in all the best ways, with some of the worst gore- effects and fight choreography I've ever seen in a major release. (Be prepared to double-over in a fit of laughter every time a sword is unsheathed.) Camera-work alternates between bland and flat from one scene to overly intricate and over-stylized in the next, giving it an inconsistent tone. And the actual aesthetic quality on display is on-par with a bad 90's soap opera.Oh, and did I mention nonsensical writing? Because the film is filled to burst with it. Story goes screenwriter Guinevere Turner, a talented artist in her own right, was sort-of bullied by Boll into turning in a crappy, first-pass rough-draft ahead of schedule. And instead of giving her time to fix it up with a second draft like most producer/directors do, he just took it as it was and ran with it, casually re-writing huge portions of dialog and story himself (despite not speaking English all that well) and tossing out pages left and right without discrimination. And good lord, does it show! The script as-is is just brilliant in its sheer incompetence.All in all, if you're a Boll addict like I am and you somehow haven't seen \"BloodRayne\", you really owe it to yourself to check it out. It's just so much fun in all the wrong ways. It's poorly written. Atrociously acted. Mind-bogglingly directed. And it is most certainly great entertainment in that wonderful, campy \"so bad, it's good\" kinda way. As a film itself, it's a 3 out of 10. As a piece of unintentional entertainment, however? It's pure gold. And it's a prime example of what I'll miss now that Boll is supposedly gone forever. We'll miss you, Uwe. We might not have liked your films the way you wanted... but we got a kick out of them nonetheless!",

There were many others to blame.The writer was terrible. The characters were stupid. The language they used was simply hilarious (I don't recall them using contractions, but if they did, it wasn't very often). Half the things that happened, like the fat vampire monk or the Rayne sex scene, made absolutely no sense.The stunts and pretty much any choreography were absolutely terrible, so the movie fails in this way, too.Boll screwed up in many ways, but I'm sure they're all already mentioned, so I won't bother.The acting was horrendous. Well, I've seen worse, but not by much. Kristanna Loken should not be allowed to have any parts that involve moving her face or speaking because she's not good at it. Billy Zane was pretty cool, but I don't see why his character was included at all. Michael Madsen was terrible for the part he played. Michelle Rodriguez tried to do a British accent and failed.Really, the only good thing about this movie was that there was enough action to keep me interested until they end. Only that warranted the 3/10 I gave it.I couldn't figure out what the significance of the last scenes (after the climax) was supposed to be, and I imagine there was one, but I still can't think of anything several hours later.",

I already knew this movie was going to be bad because Uwe Boll, the Director has completely annihilated all the horror-based videogames to movie conversions out there, House of the Dead & Alone in the Dark are proof of this testament.The thing that shocked me was that this movie was actually worse than both of those movies combined!!! The movie follows the game's plot but he executes it very poorly. Kristanna Loken who plays the role of Bloodrayne is suppose to have a \"Blade\" like personality but instead she's just another Terminator.On top of that, the action scenes look like they were choreographed by a blind man with brain damage (I'll leave that to your imagination). Bloodrayne is supposed to have a very Gothic atmosphere but instead Uwe Boll decides to set the atmosphere at a trick-or-treat level.By the time I was done watching this movie, I realized that my eyes bled.

After viewing the unrated director's cut of BLOODRAYNE, I can safely say that he is not the worst director working today. Eli Roth remains the worst in my book. Boll is lackluster, no doubt, though there are several directors working in Hollywood far more inept. The directing is the least of the production's problems. There is no story, the acting is mostly embarrassing all around (Michael Madsen being the worst), costumes look like they were stolen from the backstage of a high school, and the music appears to have been recorded in about fifteen minutes. I would say something about the awfulness of the CGI yet I get the feeling that Boll may have wanted it to look like it came straight out of a video game intentionally, albeit an unfinished video game. As bad as BLOODRAYNE is, it has some positives. Kristanna Loken is credible in the lead, there are some impressive bloody moments, and the cinematography is generally good. I did not enjoy BLOODRAYNE. That said, I'd be interested in what Boll will do next. My rating: 3/10",

(To every person who blithely claims this is the worst film ever I recommend Raptor Island on the Sci-fi network as a primer on how bad genre films can actual be or perhaps a made for PAX disaster film such as the obviously titled Killer Flood: The Day the Dam Broke.) Yes Uwe's House of the Dead was a particularity stupid film. I hated it too. But Uwe knows how to point his camera in the general direction of the action and keep the action at a pace that holds ones interest.BloodRayne is a surprisingly enjoyable genre romp. Yes all the individual criticisms at the film from the bizarre choices in hair pieces and costumes to the silly dialogue are true. But c'mon it's a video game/vampire movie. Really how high are ones expectations going in? For a video game movie it isn't half bad. (Its tons better than say Doom, not as tightly put together as say Resident Evil) Uwe brings a refreshing European sensibility to sex and violence in the movie (In other words plenty of gratuitous nudity and violence). He also makes good use of the Romanian landscape bringing an almost Peter Jackson feel to the proceedings.Also in campy side of things it's always fun watching Hollywood professionals ruin careers for the sake of a paycheck. (The way Madsen looks and acts in this movie I wouldn't hire him to do my lawn and Kingsley acts as if he is auditioning for the Mr. Burns role in an upcoming live action Simpson's movie) So Uwe Boll isn't the next Ed Wood more a talentless Paul Verhoeven.

Story is misleading from what's it's supposed to be(and it's not all about the Nazis, there are Bloodrayne 2 as well, for those not knowing). The movie is basically effect-less considering in the Game, Bloodrayne, would be practically \"Invincible\". In the movie, My Granny could bet Bloodrayne. No Blood magic/powers is used in the movie, it's like U Boll, never actually seen or heard about the game. Bloodrayne should be a half Vamp, that would be overpowered, highly agile(no high jumping in movie, or scaling of any sort), able to control the magic or potence of the blood, for using it's power. Etc. There is a unlimited number of things that isn't as it should in the movie. The costume however, is similar(sorta, alike, but not totally) The scenery and the era is about right tho, so no complaints there. In all, this movie is a bottom-scraper. Simply because, 1. No alike the game characteristics. 2.Effectless and motionless. 3. Bad acting(probably because of scripting and directing etc).The movie do how ever have good scenery though. Good actors, though wrong movie. Someone mentioned that of Rayne would die if in touch of water. Well, in some stories, if looking up on vampiric history, there would be tales of the waters around the world would be \"blessed\" so that fiends not of this world would have more, shall we say \"problems\" to go about? Anyhow, this is how the game was made, vampires getting damaged by water, to make it more difficult for the gamer to get around, as there would be multiple water obstacles for him or her to get around.

That said, this gets 2 because although it is unbelievably wretched you can still entertain yourselves by watching it with friends and making fun of it.For that purpose, this movie is pretty good. It's got a hot chick, some nudity (which is probably why Meat Loaf agreed to do the scene: \"Okay I'll do be in this nonsense if you put me on a bed with naked women\"), and Michael Madsen, Michele Rodriguez and some no-name guy with a quasi-mullet fighting vampires with plastic swords no less.Ben Kingsley is in the movie. Not sure why he did this. It looks like they shot all his stuff in one day, on two sets. That's better than having to ride a horse and swing a sword around like a fairy (Madsen and the mullet-guy) or wear horribly unflattering costumes and then have a silly underwater fight scene(the T3 girl and Rodriguez) \u0096 but still\u0085Like in other recent vampire movies (see Underworld) these bloodsuckers don't actually seem to have any \"powers\" per se \u0096 so the fight scenes are ridiculous and pretty lame. These vampires can't even jump good. Apparently have to have human \"thralls\" to fight for them.I'd guess that if you played the game you might understand some of the stuff about bits of vampire needed to rule the land or whatever. It doesn't make any sense in the movie. Most of the movie is like that.The dialog and the story are weak. The acting is flat. What little CG there is in the film is amateurish and often unnecessary. I expected that \u0096 because such things take talent and skill and a reasonable amount of intelligence to do well. What's unbelievably pathetic are the props. If you can't afford, or can't spend the time creating real looking weapons, clothes and armor - just go to a fricking renaissance festival \u0096 spend a few hundred dollars on the props, just try a little to make this look as good as Xena.I know that it is based on a video game, but that should be the starting point to making something better don't you think? This movie is silly \u0096 just look at the packaging, there isn't an actual screen shot anywhere on the box because they know that every bit of this movie looks like some kids made it in the back yard.Then, at the end there is this horribly long, recap of everything that happened in the movie you JUST watched.

The Brimstone Society, a group of warriors seeking to end the tyranny of vampires forever, discover that Kagan, king of the vampires, has sent his troops to find & bring back a number of artefacts that, once combined, will make Kagan invincible to all forms of attack. At the same time, a damphir (vampire-human hybrid) named Rayne, the product of Kagan raping her mother, flees from the circus troupe where she has been kept prisoner. Her quest to find & kill Kagan causes her to cross paths with members of the Brimstone Society, they deciding to join forces in order to defeat Kagan for good. But Kagan's army learns of Rayne's existence & their spy inside Brimstone's ranks strikes to steal the artefact that they have been guarding.Film Analysis: After making the likes of HOUSE OF THE DEAD & ALONE IN THE DARK, German director Uwe Boll has decided to cap off his hat trick of subpar video game adaptations by setting his sights on BloodRayne, a video game wherein the player controls Rayne, a female vampire/human hybrid who is fighting Nazis in World War II, trying to stop them from acquiring artefacts in an attempt to grant Hitler immortality. As a result, the product of this melding has earned a rightful place in the IMDb's bottom-ranking films list.The original game was quite good & had an interesting plot but Boll (who has a habit of picking the most ill-suited people to write his scripts) made a mistake in hiring Canadian lesbian actress Guinevere Turner to write the script for this one. The Nazis are out (although they would finally appear in the third BloodRayne film), instead having Rayne fight an army of sword-wielding vampires in an attempt to avenge her birth.I've never been an outright hater of Uwe Boll's works. To give Boll his due, his films, while having poorly-written stories, were at least quite slick & delivered on the action & gore. The only reason people hate him is because of his writers failing to adhere to the canon of the games they are adapting \u2013 the absence of the 'house' in House of the Dead being a good example. Here, Boll is stuck doing a film that really should have been about a hot vampire chick fighting Nazis in World War II. I would have killed for that (indeed a couple of weeks before writing this review, I've acquired a copy of BLOODRAYNE: THE THIRD Reich & will review it sometime next year \u2013 & it had better be good!).As it stands, BloodRayne is just another subpar video game adaptation \u2013 in fact even worse than Boll's previous films. The sequels would improve on this (if only slightly) but for now the franchise seems to have had a very messy birth. The story, despite being inconsistent with the original game, at least tells the story of how Rayne came to be & her quest to kill her vampire father. It's sort of a female version of Blade, only set in Medieval Europe.The acting is hideously patchy. Kristanna Loken, having made her debut as the female Terminator in TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES, makes the best of not much. She was never terribly convincing in that role & fares even poorly here, although she tries her best to connect with the bad dialogue. The only thing she has going for her is her looks (indeed the one thing that saved her performance in T3), with Boll doing the right thing by video game nerds by featuring her in a (hilariously ineptly handled) love scene, although he holds back on the nudity, annoying those same nerds. Michael Madsen does his usual swagger, although here he looks out of place with his bad wig & either-drunk-or-stoned demeanour. As for Ben Kingsley\u0085 well, let me tell you this: the sight of Kingsley baring his teeth & sinking them into a pretty young girl while trashing his good name by appearing here will be worth the price you pay for renting the DVD.",

As if they would do the scenes that Kristanna did in this flick. This movies fighting scenes were so bad that the blood squirting out looked like someone popped a balloon full of red water. OUCH! The movie gets two thumbs down but Kristanna get two thumbs up. Now she needs to make a really good movie and have a staring role to move up in the world.",

In fact, I think the only reason why she has ever been in anything is because of her looks (which I don't even appreciate). Ben Kingsley, one of the most respected thespians in the world, is actually worse than her, though, because you know he has talent. Meat Loaf is another nightmare, who spends all his time rubbing up against nude women.And since when is Billy Zane a \"special appearance\"?!Terrible music, gut-wrenchingly-bad cinematography, and (and I cannot stress this enough) ****lousy**** performances!!I will leave you with a quote from an episode of \"Futurama\" that is appropriate here. \"There's a suicide booth in the food court-- though there's a line....\" (from \"Xmas Story\")",

            "content": "This movie was based on a game, so I have to start there.BloodRayne was one of the most enjoyable (FUN) PC games of it's time. I was on a list to Pre-order BloodRayne 2 as soon as I heard about it. It was disappointing that it came out for console games first and was later adapted for PC. The best games are plaid on a computer with high end monitor, not some cheap console and a TV. As with most games ported from console to PC, the controls were no where near what they should be, but the outstanding storyline, graphics, sounds, etc. more than made up for that. It was not Half Life 2, but it was fun.BloodRayne got lots of bad reviews, but I think those people just don't appreciate this type of movie. I wish they would stick to the boring kinds of movies that they like instead of trying to find fault with things they don't understand.Kristanna Loken was awesome as Rayne! Michelle Rodriguez also plaid her part well. Michael Madsen, Matthew Davis, Billy Zane, and Ben Kingsley were OK for their small parts, but the dialogue could have been better. The guest appearance by Meat Loaf as Leonid was a treat.The game had LOTS of blood, and the movie did not disappoint in this area. The swards and wardrobe were nice too. Again, this movie is based on a game, not a history lesson. It was nice to see one of my favorite characters on the big screen without having to control anything. I can't think of anyone better than Kristanna to play Rayne, and I think most of the key characters were true to the game.Probably the only downside with the movie, was that it seemed to be a mix between the first and second game. Rayne was not discovered at a carnival as shown in the movie, but that didn't bother me. Kagan was in both games so it did come together OK, but I think two movies (one for each game) would have been better. I was also disappointed that Mynce, a Tibetan-born Dhampir, Rayne's friend and mentor, was not in the movie! I think Michelle Rodriguez could have done that part quite well, or better yet, Lucy Liu or Tia Carrere.Thank You Uwe Boll for making this movie for me, and people like me. It's one of my favorite DVD's that I will watch repeatedly. In fact, I watched it again just yesterday.",

Indeed there is no definite story line and the vampires really die to easy but who wants an all powerful vampire when you got a nice looking Damphir like Kristanna.

            "content": "BloodRayne does not deserve appraisal, but I do have to congratulate Uwe Boll on making a film where the plot actually makes a little bit of sense. The movie suffers from Boll's typical over-emphasis on action and sex rather than comprehensive transition, but at least the characterization was done fairly well.The film is well worth the peak for vampire-enthusiasts, but most people will not find much else redeemable about the film. A few other points that I feel are worth mentioning...The use of English accents was a nice touch as well as the occasionally sarcastic, anachronistic dialogue. Unfortunately the film still suffers from occasional nonsensical utterings that rather disrupt the flow of the film. Additionally Ben Kingsley's speaking-parts were incredible stiff, even if he managed to bust a few giggles out of me with his \"ungrateful bitch\" line.Though gracious titty-shots were abound I feel that the single most ridiculous use of them occurs during the ridiculous sex-scene between Sebastian and Rayne. Additionally Boll should get by now that adding gore doesn't make an action-scene credible.Also, while I have not played the actual game I have to say that the plot did bring to mind Simon's Quest, though I hope the upcoming Castlevania-film will have more enthusiasm and talent behind it.In the long-run it's actually difficult to say anything concrete about the film. Parts of it are clumsy, parts of it are okay. Dialogue and action scenes are stiff and awkward at times yet convincing at others. The film contains some unintentional hilarity, but the parts that were intended to be funny also 'are' funny. The ending is not memorable, but it's not unsatisfying.The film is neither good or bad. It really depends on one's attitude towards vampires.",

Along with strange soundtrack mixing, it's a tough listen.Now let's talk about the plot, wait was there one? Kill Ben Kingsley bc he's a rapist, murderer, etc I guess. They throw in a couple of talismans, \"the eye\" and \"the heart\" that Rayne incorporates into her body, that do absolutely nothing. I kept waiting for her to somehow 'use' the talismans, or that they would at least flare up and show some sign of life, but they must have run out of budget because they never came into play other than Rayne just saying she had them.Also bad boss sidekick comes to boss with a wooden box implying that the heart is in it. But apparently he never actually LOOKED INSIDE because later in an amazing twist Ben Kingsley looks and there is nothing in it. So sidekick just took Rayne at her word?? Really never even flipped the lid on that box, just to check. Really.Anyway the fight scenes are fun just because of the horror flick levels of gore. Kristanna Loken is nice to look at, the sets are good and it's a cast of thousands with all the extras which you rarely see anymore.I'm a sucker for any Fantasy genre flick so I gave it a five.

Also, I wanted to know what happened to Billy Zane's character after his encounter with Domastir. Was he killed? Did Domastir agree to join him? In the end I believe this film suffered from 3 things: bad dialog, bad editing, and I hate to say this, bad directing. The director for Terminator 3 (Jonathan Mostow) got a fantastic performance from Kristanna Loken. She was sexy, intelligent, graceful, and incredibly scary, all at the same time. That is what she needed to be for this part. What we get is what Michelle Rodriguez' character said: \"Your skills lack passion.\" I guess everyone knew what a turkey they had signed up for.",

            "content": "BloodRayne's presence in IMDb's bottom 100 is shameful. I can see how Uwe Boll's last film, the idiosyncratic \"Alone In The Dark\", could be misinterpreted as utter rubbish but BloodRayne is a minor genre masterpiece. Few films have combined horror, fantasy and action elements as effortlessly. The end result is Boll's best computer game adaptation yet and a film that stands alone as a superior piece of entertainment. Forget about Boll's undeserved reputation as the worst director ever to pick up a camera and judge this film on its many merits.This is the third film in Uwe Boll's unofficial computer game adaptation trilogy, the first two films being \"House Of The Dead\" and the notorious \"Alone In The Dark\" \u0096 both of which currently grace the bottom 100. Like its predecessors, BloodRayne has been mauled by every armchair critic with internet access, despite the fact that these films are very well regarded by their intended audience. As far as computer game adaptations go, it doesn't get much better than BloodRayne. Indeed, as far as genre films in general are concerned, BloodRayne is excellent. The manic plotting that made \"Alone In The Dark\" and \"House Of The Dead\" hard to comprehend for non-gamers has all but disappeared this time around. The plot has been pared back to its bare bones and there is considerably more focus on character development.BloodRayne could be described as a medieval \"Underworld\", only without the burning desire to constantly rip off \"The Matrix\". The central character, Rayne, is an interspecies crossbreed who escapes from a freak show with the sole ambition of killing her vampire father \u0096 who raped and murdered her human mother. Rayne soon finds herself a target for her father's henchmen but finds unlikely assistance in the form of Vladimir and his society of vampire hunters. If this is all sounding rather familiar, the presentation is anything but. Boll has jammed enough blood and action into BloodRayne to fill three Hollywood blockbusters. There are also enough subtle twists and turns, like the search for power boosting vampire relics, to give the film a fresh edge.The film's action sequences are incredibly well done and impressively violent. Olaf Ittenbach's gore effects are simply brilliant. Ittenbach, the German horror auteur behind cult classics like \"Premutos\" and \"Garden Of Love\", is renowned for his old school, ultra-excessive gore and from the first beheading in BloodRayne, it is obvious that Ittenbach has left his fingerprints all over the movie. His more-is-more approach to carnage is apparent in the battle scenes, all of which end up as blood baths, and the darkly humorous human sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord in a vampire's castle. Unfortunately, the computer effects are not nearly as refined as the more traditional gore effects and some of the dead vampires effects could have been lifted from an episode of \"Buffy\". Thankfully, the film only indulges in these sparingly.The acting is the usual Boll mix of the sublime and the ridiculous. Kristanna Loken proved in \"Terminator 3\" that she is one of the few current Hollywood actresses who can handle action roles without looking completely idiotic. Kristanna shows up the likes of Jennifer Garner and Kate Beckinsdale for being the complete turkeys they are. Her performance as Rayne is captivating in its restraint and physicality. The rest of the colourful cast is decidedly hit and miss. Michael Madsen is on auto-pilot, but he could spend a movie unconscious and still be charismatic. The same could be said for Michelle Rodriguez, who looks bored but still has an undeniable presence. Matthew Davis is the wooden male lead and Rayne's love interest. I'm sure Rayne could snap him like a toothpick. The current king of the over-acting brigade, Billy Zane, does his slimy villain routine with ease, while Boll regular Will Sanderson is appealing as Domastir. Ben Kingsley must have needed a change of pace after one too many dreary Spielberg movies and is a treat in a camp tour de force as Rayne's evil vampire father. Udo Kier and Michael Pare have nice but insubstantial cameos. The most bizarre cameo undoubtedly belongs to Meatloaf, who appears to be drunk or high.BloodRayne never pretends to be high brow. The film is only interested in pleasing genre fans and it does a fine job. BloodRayne still has the occasional B-grade edge (using the tourist landmark Neuschwannstein as the exterior of a vampire castle was a classy touch) but most of the criticism thrown at the film is completely ridiculous. I would take BloodRayne over half of the films of IMDb's top 250 any day.",

Just the shear fact someone was able to fund, write, shoot and release a film they deserve a 5. Even a film this bad. There are some movies which beg to ask why they were ever made. This is one of them. I do not know if Uwe Bol goes out of his way to make the worst film he can, but if this was intended to be a quality film, Uwe is in bad need of film school.Performances are dialed in here; all for a paycheck. Michael Madsen is NOT the actor to give this tripe supposed old English dialog to. He is more at home playing the local scum, not a medieval sage. His delivery, which works in other films is totally wrong for this role. I cringed every time he spoke a line. However, I don't know if Madsen's delivery was as bad as Rodriquez's attempt at a English accent. Not since Kevin Costner's feeble attempt in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, have we been witnessed to a worse accent. But then again, one could give her marks for at least trying. But I just can't. Just an absolute terrible movie. Then we are assaulted with the Unrated version on DVD that turns up the bad gore and blood effects to the maximum. The money spent on this film was all in the locations as that is the only thing that has a faint hint of substance. The trees seen in the woods have more personality than our female lead who exhibits zero acting ability here.The action is straight out of the movie stuntman's handbook. These painfully orchestrated action sequences are so slow and deliberate one expects to see the players mouthing the numbers to each step and swing they take.What the hell was Ben Kingsley thinking when he signed on for this? Though he is one of the few actors here that actually can act through anything, you still wonder what made him take this on. Another stand out is Billy Zane. He brings a much needed gusto and a realization of the limits of the piece, but by damn he is going to make the best of it anyway. Everyone else is trying to make it Shakespere which makes their performance all that much more mechanical and ludicrous.There is always going to be someone that likes this type of stuff, more power to ya.

Rayne is introduced as a circus attraction (we'll never know why she wasn't able to overpower her few captors with vampire strength,she must have been pretty content with the free goat blood.)All the while Vladmir(Madson)and his team are busy on some crusade we're never really sure of to eliminate Kagen (Kingsley).Rayne escapes if you can imagine and kills all the non deformed folk including a woman who earlier befriends her(?) nope dead.Meanwhile Vladmir and his goons discover the ravaged gypsy camp and immediately suspect a young vampire (how?) bodies were laying there I suppose an older vampire would have tidied it up a bit.So then Kagel (Kingsey) is introduced and we come to discover that coincidently he has been searching for Rayne her entire lifetime and at that moment informed she is at the gypsy camp, so he sends a foot soldier to bring her to him.Rayne wanders through the woods with only her guilt to guide her and happens to stumble upon a village of vampires.She kills them they die pretty easily (in bloodrayne vampires have no sense of self preservation) an old woman with tarot cards grabs Rayne's attention and reveals to her that Kagel is her dad and there are 3 artifacts that can destroy him cause he is you guessed it the most powerful vampire ever.Hidden away, the eye artifact was fairly easy to locate because she got on her horse and rode right to it. Obtaining it involved lying to the clergy to gain trust, walking down to the basement, engaging in \"battle\" with some Nemesis like reject who didn't seem to enthused with staying alive so he could go on guarding the eye in the bottom of a church.She kills him enters a hidden doorway and suddenly its Raiders of the lost ark.She dodges rolling saw blades with lightning fast agility which is the only time you ever see this agility used again in the duration of the film.She gets the eye looks at it now she can touch water, which is a good thing cause the room starts filling up with it(whew).Kagels men infiltrate the monastery which is guard by swordweilding men of the cloth.She gets captured and taken to meatloaf who wont give her up without a nice choreographed fight but look out! Vladmir and the two others with him have come to kick ass & break glass which cooks meatloaf.They take her back to Birmingham which is their safe haven Kagel hasn't bothered to find, where this half-human/vampire is received well by the town folk (they all die) In a brief but effective training exercise Rayne is now ready to take on Kagel but first she must sleep with Vladmir's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in a sexual charge of shared emotional similarity due to Kagel.Oh yeah Billy Zane makes an appearance as a vampire who knows something.Rayne Vladamir and buddy go for more supplies just as Kagels men invade Birmingham leaving the town defenseless to slaughter.Over the horizon they see the carnage Rayne decides to look for artifact 2 (turns out Kagel has the 3rd) She goes to the ruined Birmingham to seek information and is guided by her vampire intuition to a cave where lo and behold the heart is, since the entire time it was under Birmingham.She hatches a plan to infiltrate Kagels castle that involves the honor system and stupidity so she willingly gets captured.Kagel is pleased that Rayne has discovered the heart but never opens the box that is presented to him(its empty).He begins some ritual to make himself even more powerful as Vladamir and sidekick conceive of a dastardly plan to storm the castle and rescue Rayne.Unfortunately Kagel has a small army of vampires at his disposal but this isn't given a second thought, they are captured immediately and taken to a prison cell which throughout the whole film these vampires have killed everyone, but they decide to spare these guys. (nuff killing for one day I suppose)Vladmir instinctively tricks the one guard placed on duty with the ol' \"hey my buddy who is also here in the cell with me is gone\" trick so the guard opens the cell and wham-mo knocked unconscious! After that who cares about the rest of the movie right? You guessed it Vladmir and his companion kill all the vampires that once captured them, die by Kagel who Rayne kills.The artifacts were as meaningless as the movie,good points were when Vladmir dies the super intense final battle between Kagel and Rayne,the sex scene,and the credits.

Uwe Boll's name is fast becoming synonymous with bad films and after seeing this one I think he is about as bad as the infamous Ed Wood. The film's plot doesn't matter, it didn't seem to matter to the director who shot this with all the zest and skill of a drunken campfire tale, and it didn't seem matter to the actors who all seem to be acting without knowing what order the scenes will be shown. In the end it didn't matter to me either. This movie is entirely forgettable and will probably be considered a stain on the resumes of all parties involved, and the worst part is that the director seems baffled that so many people think that it is a terrible film. My advice, if you must watch this film, have a few drinks first and if possible have a back up film on standby in case those drinks don't dull the pain enough.",

I read somewhere in a gaming magazine that maybe it is not the film makers we should blame for making bad movies. We should blame the video game industry for selling them the rights. This could have been so much more. The game was enjoyable with a decent story to follow. Mr. Boll(?) has a reputation for making bad films. This was nothing more than a hack and slash blood fest. I enjoy a good horror flick too but it really needs purpose and above all it should at least make sense with the movie. Good Grief! This was just plain awful. So again I ask who is to blame the film maker with no sense of direction or the gaming industry for wanting to capitalize on a game. Kristina Loken was not a very good choice for Bloodrayne and as I do like Michele Rodriguez, I don't think this was a good casting decision.",

The fighting scenes are not very good, but that's the way they are in almost all movies. The bad characters are generally mildly evil, not diabolically evil. The good characters have their weaknesses and tend to die in the fights. Those are rather good points too.I heard in one of the scenes the half-naked women around Leonid (Meat Loaf), were real prostitutes as they were cheaper to hire than real actresses. Well, I think they were more suited for that role than actresses, I couldn't tell the difference.I watched it on TV and I felt quite entertained. I didn't feel like changing the channel at any point, so I don't understand those 90% of the comments which rate this movie as awful.

Kristanna Loken is undeniably the worst representation of Rayne a person could have ever chosen. she looked more like Vladimir than Rayne. Secondly, No actor in this entire movie could speak a decent line, all the special effects made me feel like i was watching the 1979 version of Dracula staring Rayne instead, the dialog was rushed the entire movie and every sequences was clich\u00e9 past the point of acceptance for any movie, and Uwe Boll is probably the most God awful person alive and has created such monstrosities as House of the dead and Alone in the Dark. The whole movie is confusing, so not just by Uwe's bad direction, but also the screenplay and plot was horrible. No one should ever see this, every copy made should be burned to protect children and those who have seen it and yet alone liked it should be treated as lepers. Last of all, this movie was so bad (other than the over dramatic, forced love scene) if Kristanna went the whole movie topless, having sex with every male character including Kagan, this movie would still get a 1 out of 10.

It's easy, I KNOW he made it stink ON PURPOSE! I saw so much obvious room for improvement, from the poorly emoted lines to the cheesy fight scenes, I just couldn't excuse the mistakes given his resources and cast. I mean good grief, he had Ben Kingsley reading his lines with all the passion of ordering a Big Mac and fries at McDonalds! Ben, for this movie and for The Sounds of Thunder, I want to give you a good swift kick in the rear! At one point I could EASILY see wires, and I don't even look for movie errors on a regular basis, I read them here on IMDb and then say \"oh yea, I could see that mistake.\" I'm giving this movie a 3/10, which is good for Herr Boll's movies. I just wish he'd taken more time with this and taken it seriously! This guy only cares about the German tax breaks for pumping out movies, he cares nothing about art or entertainment.In my opinion, something like this proves that his movies should be BANNED in American theaters and go direct to video until he make something other than the regular trash.You took something great and ruined it, Herr Toilet, I just rejoice every day that Hideo didn't give you the rights to Metal Gear Solid.Thank you Hideo!",

            "content": "\"BloodRayne: The Movie\" is yet another butchering of a very good video game by Uwe Boll the Toilet Boll. The story is all about Rayne, a Dhamphir (that's a cross between a human and a vampire) who grew up in a freak show because how quickly she can recover by drinking blood after being burned in water. One night, Rayne gets her first taste of human blood (she drinks sheep blood, you see), causing her to go ballistic and escape the freak show. She joins up with a gang of vampire hunters calling themselves The Brimstone Society who are after Kagan, the king of vampires and Rayne's father (no happy family reunions here!). If you have never played the video game, let me tell you this piece of crap is absolutely nothing like it; the game takes place in WW2 and you have to fight the GGG (Gegengheist Gruppe which literally means \"anti-ghost group\"). In the movie, it's set in the 17th or 18 century and there is no GGG.Now, I shall list things that made this \"movie\" terrible (other than the mentioned different stories) The acting: What acting? It's all people reading cue cards. You can tell because they all look at something off the set and randomly pause in some parts.Props & costumes: All cheaply made stuff that looks like they bought it at a costume hire store (they probably did).Rayne's outfit in the movie looks nothing like the one in the game; in the game it's made out of latex so Rayne can move more easily and her daggers are attached to her gloves so she doesn't have to carry them. The movie, it's made from cheap leather and Rayne has to carry her daggers.The \"Star\" of this monstrosity: I won't list the entire cast, just Kristanna Loken. She looks and sounds nothing like Rayne and she makes a really ugly redhead. For those who don't know, Rayne was the first video game character to be in a a Playboy magazine.Nudity/Sex: There's a half naked herom and a totally random sex scene between Rayne and some guy. Now, this may sound good, but there was no nudity and sex whatsoever in the game and it does nothing to make the movie go forward and, in general, is completely unnecessary.The ONLY thing redeeming in \"BloodRayne\" is the pretty Romanian scenery. Other than that, it's all bad! Had \"BloodRayne: The Movie\" been made by someone else other than Uwe Boll the Toilet Boll, it probably would of been pretty decent or even very good.In conclusion\" \"BloodRayne\" is a butt ugly piece of crap. People who think it's great or the best movie ever and mean it, are either 13 year old teenage boys and/or losers who can't get a girlfriend.Avoid this movie, it was damned right from the start.",

Much better than its god awful sequel House of The Dead 2: Dead Aim. Which in my opinion is a piece of $@#% on the side of the road! Alone in the Dark wasn't that bad either. Sure some parts were slow, but it was good action/horror movie. Bloodrayne I loved, it has to be my favorite of the three. I wanted to see it so bad when it came out in theaters last January, but it didn't last long here at all and I missed it. So I bought the DVD and enjoyed every minute of it. I thought it had a lot of action, some great CGI too. I don't know why people say it sucks. Bloodrayne was like a Medieval Blade movie except with a girl. Some of the coolest looking death scenes too. The lady at Blockbuster kept telling me not to buy the movie, but I didn't listen to her. I could care less what she thought; she couldn't even say the name of the movie right. That right there tells you she knew nothing about the movie and probably never even saw it! Go ahead bash me; I thought it was good action/horror movie. I waited months for the DVD, and I was not one bit disappointed. I wish I could have seen this in theaters, it would have been even better on the big screen. If you're a fan of the Bloodrayne video games, definitely check out the movie. It's great and full of blood! I for one liked the movie. I'm probably one of the few people in the world that did too. Looking forward to seeing Uwe Boll's next films.",

I'm not going to waste my time on this one too much, but I'm going to tell you bad things in this, as there are NO good things about this movie. Michael Madsen looks so goddamn unimpressed that he has signed on to do this and he simply reads his lines like he's reading them for the first time. Ben Kingsly looks ridiculous and also can't seem to take this film seriously either. Now there isn't anything great about good actors not trying, but what is worse is the bad actors trying to act good. Kristanna Loken and Michelle Rodriguez are not bad persae but they aren't good in this garbage. And to be fair it's not the actor's fault that the script and direction are SO terrible. I remember when I said there isn't anything good about this, I Lied, When the little boy asks to see Kristanna Loken's \"boobs\" I laughed. One time this movie made me express a emotion of joy ha ha.

I find it difficult to take bad reviews on this film from people who have not played the games. I found the story line both intelligent and well acted, Uwe Boll kept to the ideals and theories of the games while also taking it to a whole new level, which allowed leverage on the characters. If the director had ventured further he would have lost the audience, but thankfully he didn't. Kristanna Loken played the character of Rayne amazingly, I found myself drawn into the story of her life through the great acting of Loken and her fellow actors.

            "content": "The most amazing thing about Uwe Boll is how he keeps on coming up with enough money to make movies. I think the best comment on his films i actually heard in a key note at the Game Developers' Conference many years ago. I don't remember the speaker but the quote stays etched in my mind:\"WHY do we keep selling this guy movie rights to our games?? Do we have NO shame or pride at all??\" Bloodrayne is no exception in the Ewe Boll string of losers based on video-games. The really sad thing about a Uwe Boll move is, there is usually an interesting idea in there somewhere that he manages to totally butcher by the end of the film. In Alien v. Predator, it was the idea that Mayan ritual sacrifice was inspired by the memory of the Predator species being worshiped as gods and using humans to raise Aliens for sport hunting. Bloodrayne is nothing quite that interesting, being the same old \"half-vampire\" vampire-hunter we've seen time and again. However the four-way power-struggle he sets up has strong political possibilities...Which, of course he drops on the floor and totally mangles. A main actor in the plot in fact isn't even mentioned at the end of the film and just left out in the ether all badly written stories consign characters and plot-threads to.Add to this his mania to apparently put iconic shots in that are totally unjustified. (SOMEONE explain to me the \"Conan takes the throne\" bit at the end in someone whose entire motivational repertoire has been one thin revenge plot and what her sitting on a throne with everyone else dead around her has ANYTHING to do with the rest of the movie and I'll buy you a beer.)Someone else reviewing this movie compared Uwe Boll to Ed Wood. I think thats unfair to both of them. Ed Wood was a totally incompetent film maker, but he loved film and really thought he was trying to make good ones. Uwe Bool is a semi-competent hack who seems to pick material he has total disdain for and it shows. His cinematography and editing is far better then Ed Woods... which makes the results all the more unappetizing because you get the feeling he COULD make a good movie if he actually gave a damn.",

But I smelt danger when that friend of Rayne's in the freak show began spouting lines similar to those said by \"Sean Penn\" in Team America. The next part where she gains blood lust is a flashback of a poorly done fight scene while she whimpers and cries before a load of 80-s movie style vampires appear and attack a few travellers. She kills them in the most unspectacular way and spouts more crap lines.Shortly after this, I lost my patience with this movie and stopped watching. I literally said \"No, no. Just...take it away. No. That's enough, I've had enough. No.\" The designs, fight choreography and script were shite beyond all hope of redemption. I personally don't hate Uwe Boll because he's only a director, and his main error is to make movies from video games, but what was he thinking?????!!!!!! All in all, leave this one alone - you'll never regret not seeing it.Kristanna Loken wasn't great either, though I hear the sex scene would be worth watching if you want a quick fix - something I left the movie too early to watch.At least it's better than still voices still lives.",

My first reaction was laughing. Then I cried. I still can't believe that the movie can be so ruined. It totally cracked my idea for bad movie. Even \"Tom & Jerry\" has better effects than this \"creation\" of the incredible mind of the director - Uwe Bol. Dumb, simple kills, some sort of sword fighting, not really successful of course, some corpses and blood more like water then like blood. I can't understand that man.The actors. Horrible. I really want to know why was Kristina Loken chosen to play Rayne's role, and what does Madsen do in this movie? But who else then Kristina Loken would agree to play in movie directed by Uwe Bol? Madsen. I don't know why. It seems like some kind of mistake, because his place surely isn't in this movie. The acting is out of the question. The scenario is like written by four years old boy and then thrown to the garbage, where Uwe and his team found it. The dialogs are strange. Some serious guys are may be talking about the end of the human race. We are scared. This could be the horror element in the movie. When they finish talking they fight a bit and that's supposed to be the action element. We have successfully completed the genre requirements.The whole thing is more like comedy than horror or action. There was nothing unique or interesting in this movie. The director even hired prostitutes for some of the scenes. I think that any person with a bit mind in his head WILL NOT watch this... thing. If Uwe does not understand that he CAN'T make movies it's time to realize it.",

The acting was awful, like the actors just got the script 10 minutes before coming on set, even for people like Michael Madasen. They just looked like they just woke up and didn't even care about the movie, just for the paycheck. I will give it this, it is better than House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark, but thats not saying much. I gave Dead and Dark a 1 each and I gave this a 3, mainly because of Loken, she was amazingly hot in this movie, from the sexy clothes to the sex scene that comes out of nowhere.

Considering some of the actors that this thing had--Michael Madsen, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Rodriguez--that's shocking. I'm blaming the director for that one; he or she doesn't know how to use good performers.Second, Rayne's choreography was stilted. We all saw Kristanna whoop butt with Arnold in T3, so we know she can handle an action role. Even though she moves like a woman (as in she doesn't act butch), a woman can still fight and look like she can fight. Loken's moves were slow and girlie, not like a half immortal soldier woman.Finally, the story line was completely one dimensional and very clich\u00e9. The most powerful of all vampires seeks items that will make him invincible. The only one who can stand up to him is a damphir--a half vampire-half human woman named Rayne who became what she is because the vampire lord raped and killed her mother. That's it--that's the plot line. It tries to add in a subplot or two, but it fails miserably.My advice: don't waste brain matter on this movie. If you have a hankering to see Kristanna Loken, re-watch T3 or check out Painkiller Jane.",

            "content": "After seeing this directors first 2 films and reading the previews and reviews of his latest film I feared the worst. Perhaps that is what helped me when seeing this because all in all I have seen worse. Of course the lead actress doesn't even remotely look like the figure from the video game and of course the action is cheesy, let alone the fact that a surprisingly large bunch of semi known actors look not involved to put it mildly. But what do you expect from a video game to screen adaptation. The story will be paperthin and the only way of filming it will be to make it as cheesy as this here. however the major problem is the lack of charisma on the side of the main female character. In the game she was a Lara Croft with swords for guns and if I remember correctly she fought Nazis while uttering wise cracks and she was cool. This girl- mostly known for a stern faced terminator 3 part- is not that attractive and is as acrobatic as a wet Monday newspaper. In other words not very convincing. But if you are looking for some sword action and lots of blood gushing over the screen you could give this one a chance. It is not as bad as many people say it is, the reason for that - in my humble opinion- is in a lot of cases the fact that it is fashionable to put this director all the way down. And although this isn't a masterpiece by any standard it is watchable. The climax of the film btw actually shows the lead character not being convincing at all because in order to give her the chance to kill the head vampire she actually needs the help of her two friends who are both nearly dead before she is able to put a surprisingly lame little knife into the main villain.. but that is after she has shown not to be handy at all with the custom swords she is handed earlier on. A lot of the \"well known\"actors in this film have bit parts, Meatloaf for example has an embarrassing bit part and comes and goes , I lost Billy Zane halfway the movie and that girl from The fast & the furious looked kinda glad when she could check out near the end too. The FX are crude and not really there and the vampire part is played down a whole lot too. But still, don't put your expectations too high and form an opinion yourself. You could do a lot worse",

The plot was one dimensional allowing no character development. The dialogue was elementary. The action was hack/slash just so they could spray fake blood, even the sword fights were horrible- they didn't even try. The ending made no sense. From a pure movie making point of view, there weren't even any really good cinematic shots; the clothing looked like it was purchased from a replica catalog's mistakes; and the sets were uninspired.

I was also surprised at the amount of actors in it that I recognized. In hindsight I should have done a little more research. Michelle Rodriguez in 18th Century Romania should have been a clue for me. I like her acting but that fake British accent was just bad. I also should have taken note of the fact that no critics had reviewed it and it was only showing in two theaters in a 100 mile radius from my place. As the opening credits rolled, they billed Billy Zane as \"Special Appearance By\" which I believe is usually reserved for a TV show. I honestly gave this movie an unbiased shot. I didn't listen to the user reviews on Yahoo done by people who can't spell or punctuate to save their lives. But the longer this movie ran on, the more it sank in that I had just wasted $8.50 and 2 hours of my life that I wouldn't be able to get back. The dialog in this movie sounds like it was written by a junior high school playwright with no social life. It was so cheesy and so corny that I wanted to throw something at the actors to wake them up to the career suicide they were committing. The action scenes were also horrible, looking like they were all still practicing for the real thing. They moved slow and deliberate, like they were afraid to kill the person they were about to stab, which when they did, spouted out fountains of blood on the order of a Japanese anime. Every plot point in this movie made no sense. It felt like someone had decided there should be certain things that should happen and then just put them in that order without explaining how it moved onto the next point or deciding if it really made sense. Even worse was the sex scene which just comes out of nowhere. There's absolutely no indication that Rayne and Sebastian even have any attraction for each other. They're just alone in the same room, in what seems like an interlude, and suddenly they're going at it. If must been just to show of Kristanna Loken's breasts because it sure doesn't further the story. Their romance isn't even really a plot point later one. It's more like a one-night stand. In summary, there's absolutely no reason for anyone to see this movie. It's bad movie-making at it's worst and paying for it in any way, shape, or form just encourages the movie-maker. It's like giving a tip for bad service. Don't do it.",

So I usually go to see them but am usually disappointed. Given the fact that I severely disliked House of Dead, I was really expecting a big yawnfest. Plus the trailers did nothing to help me want to see the film. If anything, the trailers are absolutely horrible. I haven't seen Alone in the Dark, and don't really plan to, but with House of Dead and the bad trailers I was really bracing for a nightmare.But then as soon as the movie started, I was surprised. The visuals were very lush, the movie just looked very good (as opposed to that sickly green tint in the trailer). As far as the story, yeah, it's a bit convoluted, and doesn't exactly give you that sort of real pull, but Kristanna Loken really tries to push it and it's just enough that it doesn't seem so bad. It's unfortunate that the script isn't better, as Guinevere Turner is very talented, and did a great job adapting American Psycho into a screenplay.As far as the acting, well, Billy Zane's acting wasn't so bad. He was dictating a letter, and therefore the William Shatner-ish acting made sense. Ben Kingsley had a very quiet reserve of someone in power. Michael Madsen's acting was sort of half-there, but his character was sort of half-there, he seemed like someone who didn't care to fight anymore and just kept fighting out of a sense of duty.So yeah, nobody's going to get an Oscar out of this, but we all know that. Yeah, there's been better acting in better movies, but we all know this as well. But if you lower your expectations, drop your barrier of \"entertain me\" and just surrender to the movie, you'll find yourself sitting afterward going \"hey, that wasn't so bad. That was actually good.\" Notice, I said GOOD, not GREAT. Both me and my girlfriend give it a C+ to B- range. Is it going to be a hit with critics? No. Is it going to be a hit with Uwe Boll haters? No. But is it better than Dracula 2000, Dracula 3000, and Queen of the Damned? Yes. Is Uwe Boll getting better since House of Dead? Yes, very much so.",

It's a lot of fun, it's over-the-top action.\" This is a quote by Uwe Boll. While yes, he's talking about House of the Dead and not Bloodrayne (more on that later), it should be noted that I don't think he actually has played any of the video games he's directed. And who hasn't? Most video game-to-film movies are so far away from the actual plot that they often make no sense, B-to-Z movie film quality, and the question continues as to why this man hasn't been stopped. It's amazing to think that he's still making movies that hardly make back my own 35 cents.Don't see this movie. Go play the game, the real deal, and be the judge of it yourself. I'm too lazy to write a review because there's nothing of it deemed worthy of reviewing.",

Anyways, couldn't stand the bad acting and bad action which was so terrible it was almost like a collection of outtakes from the film. Also Uwe Boll put no efforts into the special effects or the settings of the movie at all. Ben Kingsly, cannot believe he is in the movie, after making such great films, had stood so low as to take a part in this movie? Well, save your money and don't get the DVD too.

We could see in their eyes that this was merely a policy-driven action, and that they truly felt sorry for us with our remaining time in hell.To call this an actual movie is degrading to the entire genre of film and motion pictures. Although the feature is a mere 94 minutes, the movie seemed about two hours to long. My boyfriend paid $12 so we could both watch this, and he had to admit that he spent at least $20 to much on the tickets.To comment on the weak characters and storyline would be pointless.

The dialogue was 1 of the most terrible dialogues that i was ever suffered to sit thru. I wanted 2 jam a scissors in my eardrum! Worst of all was Meatloaf's terrible acting (if u can even call this crap that). Ben Kingsley was also terrible and wooden. The only semi-passable acting was from Kristanna Loken who plays Rayne and thats not saying much! This brings me 2 another topic. The random sex scene. Rayne wakes up and has sex with Matt Davis against a jail cell. It had nothing 2 do with the crappy plot at all. BTW this was by far the most realistic part of the movie. From this scene, we can tell that Toilet.. I mean Uwe Boll was desperate 2 make a quick buck because he knew that his newest and greatest crapfest would not make much money at all. So finally, I must tell u that if u see this piece of junkola, wipe your feet on it or throw it in the dumpster as quickly as possible or in the Toilet Boll.

            "content": "On its own and looked at logically, \"BloodRayne\" mostly falls apart like a house of cards in a hurricane. And even when compared to Uwe Boll's two previous efforts, \"Alone in the Dark\" and \"House of the Dead\", it's no classic. But in regard to the first scenario, it's rather fun destruction while it lasts. And in regard to the second scenario, the movie is more than passable--which, for Uwe Boll, is saying something.I'm going to be a good sport and list the good first, because there's actually quite a decent chunk of it. There won't be any spoilers here or in the bad.The film looks good. I don't quite know how that happened, but it did. There's the slight tinge of anonymity that I've noticed with all of Boll's films so far, which is to say that a good many of the shots were flat, completely evenly lit (almost sitcom-lit), and possibly shot at a blurrier frame rate. When it matters to the movie, though, the camera actually starts moving around, the lighting becomes more pronounced, and it's a marked improvement. As a final note, the visual effects were surprisingly good all-around; a vampire ashing midway through the movie is obviously intended as only a special effect, but it looks about identical to the similar ones used in all three \"Blade\" films. The only other CG effect sequence I can recall involves what must be giant spiked pinwheels.About halfway through the movie, Loken's character arrives at the Brimstone Society's headquarters, and the ensuing section of the film is probably the best; each character save for one is at their peak in terms of development and actor/actress involvement, and there are actually scenes here that pick you up and carry you, however short the distance might be. In fact, the second half of \"BloodRayne\" is really where you can get a sense of what Boll was trying to do. And he succeeds, partially.The music is a huge improvement. For once, it seems, Boll has gone with a composer, and the difference shows. Although I must confess I can't remember the rhythm of the main theme now, I do know that it stuck with me for a short time after viewing the film.All of these are relatively minor points, except for the second one. The main reason why I kind of liked \"BloodRayne\" (and am giving it a 7) is because you can see a spark of life there, in the same way you can see it behind the screen in low-budget 1960s and 1970s monster flicks. There was effort here to try and make this a good film--more so than you could see with few other movies this year. And even the sequences that don't work (and there are a decent amount of them) have a low-rent, goofy kind of charm to them. \"BloodRayne\" is at its best in scenes like Rayne's memory of the sideshow sequence, her return to the Brimstone Society late in the film (which packs an existing if small punch that I really wasn't expecting), and a late plot point with Michelle Rodriguez's character that actually feels like it came from somewhere.I've said this before. I suppose when looking at it on its own, \"BloodRayne\" is still a bad movie. But it's so many leaps and bounds above and beyond \"Alone in the Dark\" and \"House of the Dead\" that it merits a viewing.",

And probably one of the worst sex-scenes I've ever seen - it wasn't tasteful, it was dire, bordering on the ridiculous. There are no real words to describe it. Well, there are, but the one I have in mind is four letters long and not something I want to put in this comment really... cap it off with bad comedic timing and some of the worst blood effects this side of 1980, and yes, you have a recipe for a film destined to not only flop, but be an eyesore on the landscape of cinema.Whilst it is based on the video game Bloodrayne (itself considered more a cult title than a good title), it is unbelievable to see a film that is so tired, so clich\u00e9, so predictable and so amazingly awful, that you'll want to pretend you never saw it. Not for the sake that it will make you look like a fool, but because it is so bad it could harm your mental health.This was the third Uwe Boll film I'd seen. Three strikes and you're out. And to cap it off, I know that Dr Boll have at least FOUR films in this bottom 100. I just wonder how he sleeps at night, knowing he's inflicted nothing but pain and suffering on his audiences. Or maybe he still deludes himself into the foolish belief that he's really very good. Either way, I hope his argument with one of the only distributors in Hollywood that would help him can put paid to the also awful-sounding Dungeon Siege: In the Name of The King (Though I doubt it)...I won't be subjecting myself to this man any more.

The acting was poorly done, the storyline was laughable, the gore is so terrible, it's that laughable fun stupid spraying stuff, and the ending was incredibly predictable. I hope like crazy that someone else with the power to redo this film sees how terrible it was done and recreates it, but on a level that's worth paying money for.

Wardrobe: Cheap leathers, dress-up type wigs, really fake fake blood, dull and obvious prop blades, phony vampire fangs and why is Rayne's outfit made of muted and loose leather? O_o I don't give a care what the year is! Skintight PVC is the only way to go! If her butt isn't shiny, then what the hell is it!? 2. Voice acting wasn't convincing and neither was the lip-syncing at times. 3. A better cast could've been obtained if a better director had taken the job. 4. The sets were sparsely furnished, cheap and the background effects didn't flow into a form of realism. 5. No deep character development which is necessary for any movie that's based off another form of media (like a video game). This movie would've been better if you didn't have to know the history of the game to understand what was going on. 6. Terrible script. It often tried too hard to use words that didn't belong and left me flabbergasted when they used ones that needed to be replaced in the most obvious of manners. \"The sunsets set the sky on fire.\" Give me a break. How about... \"The setting sun sends the night sky into a blazing inferno of majestic beauty.\" A bit over the top, yes, but so are a lot of aspects of the movie. 7. Question. Why does Rayne have a borderline English accent? She seems more east-coast attitude in the game. Just because they're in ancient times, doesn't mean they have to warp her personality to match the archaic theme. The spunk and fire she holds via game would've worked in an interesting why if it had been kept for the film. She's too soft-spoken and almost genial which doesn't seem right. 8. As expected in an Uwe Boll picture, there were quite a few editing flaws. How do Rayne's blades magically appear on the ground after a swing from a creature when they were not heard clattering to the stone floor and she had been using them to inspect his necklace only a moment before the attack? Ah, movie magic. 9. My god. The fight scenes are atrocious. Way too much blood, gore and guts for this sort of movie. Now me, I'm a huge fan of over the top blood spray, gutted bodies dangling from the ceiling and heads rolling around a courtyard but only in the right film. Battle Royale, tastefully over the top in an amusing way; Bloodrayne, blood bath in a tub made entirely of excrement (i.e. the gore was crappy). Of course that's expected from a bad zombie film director. 10. Since when was Bloodrayne about harems of beautiful love slave women and jiggling boobies!? Oh wait... Juggy mode does come to mind... But still, it seemed so out of place to have that much smut laced in with an otherwise violence-based video game turned movie. 11. The ending was left with absolutely nothing. Not even a final dialog from Rayne's point of view which would've went well with her series of flashbacks. This man has no vision. 12. Uwe Boll. What more needs to be said?",

Uwe Boll is completely talentless, a fresh community college grad could do better.There is no way Kristanna Loken (or anyone for that matter) was trained for any good length of time for the action sequences, they all look like LARPers at a convention.The flow of the film left it feeling disconnected, rushed, and incongruent. Scenes like the one where Rayne staggers out of her cell and mounts Sebastian, seemingly for no reason at all (and after a nightmare none-the-less) left you with your mouth open from the horror of the awful lameness and feeling insulted of your intelligence.The gore effects made me feel like i was watching a college-made horror film as rubbery as the body parts looked and as gushing as the blood was.Oh yeah the camera work/effects sucked too....and what the crap is with the last 8min?

Not because it was good, but because it featured everything I'd missed from 80's B-movie fantasy; lots of swordplay with brazen gore and bloodshed, T&A, and a requisite bondage scene. So the lighting and effects were low-budget, the fantasy period trappings plastic, story implausible, drama ineffectual and dialog, if not poor enough on its own, delivered even worse. So what if an all-star cast of excellent veteran actors put on the most flaccid performances of their lives -- with the notable exception of Billy Zane, who appeared to really get into the fantasy spirit of it, and enjoyed playing his character.I imagined it would encourage more (and hopefully more talented) directors to reconstruct the fantasy genre and bring it out of the Disney ghetto, even if they have to steer it into another ghetto -- it's certainly no more gratuitously sexual and violent than contemporary set films by directors who deserve more respect than to be mentioned in this review.If it weren't for this movie, I probably wouldn't have played the games and discovered how inadequate the film was. So Rayne was visually reproduced in live-action, with an amateur cosplay outfit that we can all recognize, but not much else about the character survived the adaptation. Boll decided to trade in Rayne's stabbing wit and black humor for outraged glares and berserk tantrums, leaving a character that lives up to Rayne about as much as Uma Thurman lives up to Emma Peel -- basically a bimbo posturing unconvincingly.Boll also took great liberties with continuity to history and character, which would've been a fair trade for good story, if that's what he delivered. Instead it showed how little respect he had for the original text he was 'adapting', and the result in comparison shows how little qualified Boll is to produce for video game, since he can't even entertain a captive audience before a passive medium.",

I'll try to be short for it would be a waste of time and effort to write a long review for something that's not even worth it. I hadn't heard of director Uwe Boll until until i saw this particular flick. In terms of mockery regarding the continuity of the story of a VG on film, I think even kids could've done a better job than Mr. Uwe Boll did. Mr Uwe Boll, i don't mean to put you down man, but face it, these are the facts, your work leaves a lot to be desired a total waste of time money and effort. If you're so keen on directing movies about vampires related to VG's, and trashing them in an indespicable mocking way. This movie is a big disappointment all across the board, but then again some of us have gotten used to Mr Boll's \"stylized\" work and know to avoid a movie like the plague whenever we see \"Directed by Uwe Boll\"",

This movie could have been very good but in the hands of Uwe things go very awry.I got to admit that i'm a little bit of a sucker for vampire movies and so i found that i probably liked this movie more than i should. It's also nice to see Olaf Ittenbach doing some makeup effects. The bloodletting and gore is pretty OK, most of the rest is not. The movie itself moves at a too slow pace and i can swear that i see some glimpse of hopelessness in the eyes of the actors/actresses. I wonder what thoughts went on in Kristanna Loken's head during the making of this film. Oh well, she looks nice as always and does a fairly good job hacking away at her enemies.This is the best movie Mr Boll has directed so far and i actually thought he was learning, very slow mind you. Apparently i was very wrong because he made a sequel to this which put him right back in crap-movie-land again.My tip as before, when you don't know what to watch, why not pop a Mr Boll film into the DVD player. You may laugh hysterically or you may cry, you may even do both. At the very least you WILL have a reaction.",

The story is sometimes pushed upon the viewer rather than told. The story hasn't got too much in common with the game it's based on. While the cast is absolutely amazing, some of the acting is very wooden. Nevertheless, it's the best Boll movie yet (which ain't saying much) and compared to some of the recent movies coming out of Hollywood, this movie is above average (which admittedly also ain't saying much).The important part is this: This movie is enjoyable and entertaining. The story is coherent and interesting. Some of the actors are great. The whole visual style of the movie is very well done. There are problems with this movie, but not more than in other recent Hollywood vampire movies - I actually prefer this to Blade 3, and it's not a whole lot worse than Underworld 2.If you like Vampire movies, don't avoid this simply because it's from Boll. The movie ain't half bad, and I'm actually wondering whether most of the people commenting here have actually seen it, or whether they simply think that Boll bashing is fashionable.",

I really wanted to give this movie a chance, but I gave up around the time they brought in Meat Loaf.I'm sure everyone's heard about this train-wreck of a movie already, so I won't go too deep into the critique other than to say that Uwe Boll wouldn't know a good movie if it ripped his nuts off and shoved them up his backside. Assuming, of course, he can take his head out of it long enough to make the room.How anyone can take actors that are at worst, 'decent' and continuously ruin their careers with this...CRAP...is beyond me. Who the hell keeps giving this guy money? Have any of these actors ever ~seen~ a Uwe Boll movie? The actors in these films have lost any and all respect I have ever had for them; there is simply no excuse for it. Either you're kissing his butt, desperate for any kind of movie role, actually ~like~ this crap, or don't have a clue and have an ego so big that you feel you alone can save it based on just presence.*sigh* No amount of groaning or bad-mouthing will every justify the SUCK that is Uwe and anything he lays eyes on, let alone makes.

One of the few movies of him that does though is Bloodrayne. Bloodrayne is sinfully dull, and any interest that could be put into the movie is squashed from it being painful to watch. The only way that you could ever actually see this movie and not fall asleep would be if you made a conscious effort not to fall asleep while watching it. The worst part about this movie is that Uwe Boll actually managed to tarnish the careers of otherwise respectable actors such as Ben Kingsley. Despite some criticisms I also like Michelle Rodriguez and thought she was wasted as well. The worst part about this movie is that it is fairly forgettable as well.

I expected BloodRayne to be splaying tons of Nazi soldiers, but instead, she did very little, but slice into poorly filmed bodies in which blood sprayed around like an uncontrolled fire-hose. Director Uwe Boll must have been highly intoxicated when he thought he could pull this one off. Every scene and every piece of the storyline seemed to be splotched together from other vampire and medieval movies. This movie falls along the same lines of every other video game adaption, disgracing the game and making a poor name for itself.

Rayne's character wasn't fine at all: the hair color wasn't right, the eye color wasn't right, the Rayne-trademark-outfit just didn't look good (and that was a VERY important factor), and overall... it all wasn't right. I really liked Loken's role on Terminator 3, but what I saw in this movie was QUITE far away from that, just like everyone's poor quality acting.The story is weak, characters are not memorable at all, Bloodrayne's vampires look even faker than Buffy's, the camera moves a LOT during the fighting scenes, the sex scene would rather fit on a porn movie (it came out of nowhere), dialogues are cheesy, and most of the movie is just TOO dark.Who's to blame?

For my money there is nothing better that a really well written/directed/acted vampire movie, and there is nothing worse than a really bad one. This one was the worst. The script was dreadful. There was no character development to speak of. It seems that the director could not decide which of the various formulae relevant to the genre he wanted to apply and so tried to use bits from them all. The result was a plot that did not hang together. This was compounded by the fact that the person responsible for continuity appeared to have been on holiday during the making of this movieIf you will pardon the pun, \"Bloodrayne\" sucks!",

The continuity errors are legion. The acting makes your neighborhood community theater performances look like a night on Broadway. Michael Madsen, Billy Zane and Ben Kingsley merely walk through their parts with as much emotion as a marble statue. The only person in the whole cast who actually put some effort into her part was Geraldine Chaplin, and she was in only about 5 minutes of this exercise in animating cardboard characters. I can only imagine that she took the part for a little lunch money.The dialog is stilted, cryptic, and seems to exist solely to keep the various blood-gushing mayhem scenes from slamming into each other.I'm told there really is a plot, but trying to find it amongst the dead bodies and truly bad swordplay is a monumentally impossible task.I do have some nice things to say about this movie. The costumes are pretty interesting, the sets are not bad, and it mercifully ended after only 95 minutes.Why was this movie made?

Boll's movies are bad, very bad -- but not spectacularly so. Actually, they are quite on par with most straight-to-video films, say, slightly below the average of that population. They don't belong on the big screen, but they are all more or less bearable. I would even give Boll some credit for the visual gimmickry he sometimes uses; at least he tries something, even if it has never worked out so far.\"BloodRayne\" (observe the sophisticated capitalization on display in this review!) is better than the previous two movies -- in fact, slightly better than the average straight-to-video fare (this is the appropriate reference frame, and that's how I rated it a 6).At least half of the rating is due to Olaf Ittenbach's brilliant make-up effects. (By the way, he, not Boll, is the worst director I'm currently aware of, his recent \"Chain Reaction\" being much worse than any of Boll's movies). The only thing that really offended me about this movie is the extremely poor work by most of the well-known actors involved. While Kristanna Loken merely lacks charisma in the role (she was so great in Terminator 3, maybe she's just a good robot impersonator), Michael Madsen and especially Ben Kingsley seem to be stuck in stage-4 sleep. Kinsley's performance here is actually a shame. Maybe he had a wager going that he could turn out a performance worse than Jeremy Iron's in \"Dungeons & Dragons\" (a movie much worse than this one) and still get his paycheck.All in all, maybe it's time that people stop ridiculing Uwe Boll for doing wrong what most directors cannot do right.

With the actors he had access to, the performances should not have been able to be bad. But there was just no life to any of it. This man needs to stop making movies.

I think some knew this was crap they were making so they didn't even bother to try, they just showed up for their scenes. The action isn't even good, it just tried to be what it is not. Rayne moves like she's wooden and I have seen movements that are more fluid in a Muppets movie.

And the blame cannot be just pointed to the actors because they have a script and usually it ends up being changed during taking but again this was written with influences of the Majesco video game BloodRayne which was excellent. I played it through its entirety. The story line through the movie disregards the story in the game. The game, Rayne is already working with Brimstone but the time period is during Nazi Germany and Rayne is only working with Brimstone because they hold the truth and location of her father. Now in the movie she literally stumbles into Brimstone and at the end she kills her father and Brimstone was destroyed. The only comparison it has to the game are names and her weapons. But as a stand alone B movie I thought it was good, could have been a lot better though, with a budget of 25 million its hard to see where it all went. But also Uwe Boll has not done the greatest movies based on video games and the writer doesn't have a lot of experience in writing stories of the dark occult theme or video games. There is a lot of bashing in this but ultimately I like this movie.",

            "content": "A most peculiar video game adaptation, BloodRayne's storyline plays out a couple of centuries before that of the games, and the film merely lifts selected characters and ideas from its source.But although the story of the film has little in common with that of the games from which it draws its title and inspiration, BloodRayne manages to include standard role-playing game clich\u00e9s all the way. There are the three objects of power to be obtained, monsters that drop keys to secret doors, bystanders apathetically disregarding the heavily armed heroes as they walk by, killing things in their way, stupid guards, campy villains, etc.Occasionally, you almost expect to hear a ding accompanied by the words \"Your quest log has been updated.\"The cast includes plenty of excellent actors, and they're all turning in pretty bad performances. Although no exception, Michael Madsen effortlessly manage to match the tone of the film with the same low-key disposition as seen in Kill Bill, among other films.However, the actors should not be blamed for the shortcomings of the script and the director. Since the film doesn't follow the plot of the games, it seems unlikely that much of the dialogue could have been taken from there, so maybe its just intentionally written in the corny style of computer RPG conversation; the same goes for much of the plot.But despite all these shortcomings, I rather enjoyed the film. Ignoring the more ludicrous details of the plot, it had an engaging and entertaining storyline, along with gripping cinematography. Oh, and the occasional mix of (pretty mild) sex and horror, bizarre enough that one has to laugh.Finally, the ending caught me completely off-guard. Completely setting aside Hollywood-standards and turning the expected RPG-style ending on its head, it was almost Hamlet-esquire, an odd turn after 90 minutes of campy RPG plot.No, BloodRayne is not the best thing to happen to cinema since The Seven Samurai. Don't be ridiculous. But was seeing this film worth the 95 minutes I spent seeing it? Yeah, I think so.",

As the saying goes \"There are only 7 types of stories and all writers are just copying from Shakespeare\", Bloodrayne copies Blade with average results. Uwe Boll is obviously taking the whole stuff very seriously, which results in somewhat laughable moments where Blade's \"making fun of himself\" helps release the pressure, but it wasn't a waste of time for me.Don't expect much jaw-dropping parts, although some scenes did make me say \"wow, never seen this before, that was cool!\" (introduction of BR, BR getting the first relic).",

House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark remain two of the worst video game adaptations around, as well as just plain bad movies. I, like everyone else had no faith in Uwe Boll and never really cared to see Bloodrayne. However, after seeing footage from Postal and hearing star Zack Ward talk favorably about it, and the fact that Bloodrayne 2 got better than average reviews (for a Boll film) I decided to give this one a shot. You probably have noticed the very low rating on here and let me enlighten you......ignore it. Ignore it because that rating is based on people hating Boll and rating it very low before it comes out. That said...on with the reviewThe movie doesn't follow the game very well which never bothered me but fans of the game may be disappointed to find that the movie acts more as a prequel then anything. Kristana Loken is actually pretty good as the lead as are her co-stars Michael Madsen, Will Sanderson(who needs to be a bigger star by the way), and Michell Rodreigaz. Ben Kingsly and Billy Zane are also in the movie but for limited screen time. The direction is still kinda sloppy but it is an improvement over Bolls other work. The action is....well it varies. Sometimes I was thinking \"wow that was kinda cool\" and other times the fights are slow and poorly choreographed. But here is the movies major weak point...the plot. It is never really explained all that well and I really didn't get involved in it very much....it was just sort of there. The ending battle is done fairly well and actually has a few things you don't see coming but I won't spoil it. The movie is really just a mediocre time waster but the fact that Bolls name is on it tends to make people hate it way more than is needed, which is sad because, Boll really is getting better as a director, but if people keep prejudging his movies he will slowly fade away....and I am sure thats what a lot of people want but some of us see that he has potential...food for thought.Gradeing (out of 10)Acting: 6.0 Action: 5 Plot:4 Characters:4 Writing/script:4 Ending:7 Overall:5.8 ( Please note this isn't on the IMDb scale where a 6.0 is really good....this is on mine....6.0 is the same as a D....so this gets like a low low D)SUMMARY: A time waster. Some fun moments...some awful moments but overall a passable video game adaptation that proves that Boll is slowly but surely getting better.

If they had just changed a couple of things about this movie, it might have actually worked out.First of all, the presentation of the background information was very sloppy and distracted from the rest of the film. This could have been done much more concisely. There should have been some kind of attraction evident between Rayne and Sebastian since that sex scene was just plain awkward. The training montage was as ridiculous as it was pointless. There were many other ways that could have been approached without lengthening the movie or distracting from Rayne's ultimate goals. The cut scenes should have been eliminated completely since there was no point at all to see her father sitting in his chair constantly. The dialog should have been written by someone with a more professional grasp of how people actually talk, and for the love of Pete, use some contractions, people! It's not going to sound any less fancy to say \"it's\" instead of \"it is\" when you're referring to some smoking beheaded chunk of former vampire. None of the side characters were sufficiently explained and BIlly Zane just appeared to be there as a money-drawing famous actor than as an actual, necessary, part of the plot. Certainly the character's part was useful, but he didn't need to be shown at all. The letters would have more than sufficed and would have given more insight into his daughter's eventual betrayal.The acting was horrid, the writing was worse, and the direction was abominable.

However when placed in comparison with there other 'bigger' movies, Bloodrayne does not seems that bad.First the cinematography is quite decent. Better than most movies. The action scenes are OK, nothing spectacular but better than most with plenty or blood and gore. The music is terrible. They have the same music for every scene, however different the mood is. If they had removed the music, the movie is 10x more enjoyable (which is why i think those watching in the cinemas will definitely hate it more than those watching at home, whom have the option of lowering down the volume) The acting are terrible, though i feel its not their fault. Feels like the director only had 1 take to save time and money and probably gave the actors the freedom to act as they wish (who would take directions from Uwe Boll). This probably explains why different actors act out in different styles (Billy Zane as though he is in a comedy, Kristanna Loken as though she is in a drama, Michael Madson as though he is in an drunken orgy and Michelle Rodriguez as though she is still in 'Lost'). Kristanna looks the part (so gorgeous and sexy that you are willing to be bitten by her) but she need help with her delivery of her lines. Give her some time and good help, she probably will turn out to be a decent actress.The story have a few plot holes (but who really cares about the story). If Uwe Boll was not the director this movie probably would have received a better review. Better than AeonFlux (a MAJOR disappointment) but not as fun as Ultraviolet. Kristanna is sexier than both actress (it helps that she has quite an explicit sex scene although its a bit sad that she showed the most emotions in that scene).5/10 in comparison with other heroine movies out there.",

            "content": "I just rented this movie today at Blockbuster, and JUST got finished watching it, and alls I can say is this: I absolutely can NOT believe what my eyes were seeing! I mean, it's like Uwe Boll took the name of the game and used it to describe ONLY the situation he put the audience themselves into (whatever qualifies as an audience; I learned the hard way that this movie wasn't a complete, total failure at the BO for nothing, which I will get into later on in this review). The only way the name \"BloodRayne\" would possibly make any sense for this movie is if he were making a metaphor out of the fate I'm sure he put numerous ones through with this incoherent, poorly acted and utterly confusing mess of a film. Notice how this movie doesn't so much relate to the games than the fact that anyone watching this crap feel like slitting themselves profusely after watching it. Look at that: raining blood from my fists, and my neck, and finally my skull... I DON'T EVEN CARE ANYMORE JUST END ALREADY! Okay, moving on...First and foremost, this movie has, with a capital N, NOTHING to do with the game to which it was based off of. Notice how Kristanna Loken doesn't look, sound, act, or even remotely resemble the character from the games. I don't recall the game character Rayne humping random guys as she sees fit in the game, much less guys she just met minutes ago as opposed to in the movie, where she's a sexually-active beast without a voice and who looks 40 in this travesty of a flick. I mean, come on, Rayne is a vampire, NOT A SLUT! The fact that Uwe Boll couldn't even grasp this simple and purely straight forward aspect of the game character just shows that his talent and credibility for film making is 0, but of course, we all knew that. And how about old man Kagan... yeah, that's right. In the movie, Kagan is an old hag without any emotion or pitch in his voice, whereas the one we remember from the games was nothing short of a middle-aged damphir with black hair and showed a lot of charisma. The one from the movie was stale and boring, and didn't look like a believable main villain at all. Kingsley portrayed the character in a way so unbelievably stale and strayed far off from the one from the games that one would have to see it to believe it (I, for one, would advise STRONGLY against it). And what the hell is with the time settings in this movie? Why is it in the 1700s in Romania instead of in Nazi Germany during WW II? That I'll never know.But anyways, even BARRING the fact that this movie is NOTHING like the games at all, there's not much to salvage here. For starters, the realism in this movie is about as believable as the mere thought of the director winning an Oscar for this movie: both are impossible and both will never EVER occur (thankfully). Just look at the repetitively slow-paced sword fighting in this movie. I mean, I sure hope I wasn't the only one who realized that it took the actors in this movie *5* seconds just to perform 2 simple swings with small daggers in their hands in fights during this movie. I forget: are we watching this in slow-mo or something? And how about the cheesy, cartoon-styled gore used during this flick? Does Boll not realize that visuals and over-the-top gore aren't all that make up a movie? Sadly, my answer is no. Boll has proved time and time again that ANYONE is capable of doing anything, even having 3 films in the IMDb Bottom 100 or (shudder) making worse films than Rollerball 02 or Battlefield Earth each time. Seriously, that takes a special kind of talent to do, and only Uwe Boll can do that.The acting? The acting is absolutely atrocious. Loken, like the rest of the cast during this movie, shows NO emotion whatsoever, nor does she (more accurately, they) have any pitch in her voice whatsoever. Her voice was so incoherent I even had trouble making out what she was trying to say at times, as with everyone involved with the flick (sadly). Their voices were so calm I had trouble comprehending them at certain moments during the movie. I seriously can't recall the last time I ever needed to turn on subtitles just to understand what the actors were trying to address, unless it was on some Spanish channel on Digital Cable, and don't even get me started on the goofs. There are too many to count, possibly even more are found on here than in a single episode of Chappelle's Show, and not in a good way, either.THE BOTTOM LINE: Please, whatever you do, stay away from this movie at all costs! It is already too late for me, but not for you. SO DON'T WATCH! THIS MOVIE WILL BE THE END OF YOU! MARK MY WORDS! THE ACTING, THE DIALOG, THE DIRECTION, VISUALS, STORY, EVERYTHING ABOUT IT IS ENOUGH TO GIVE EVEN FREDDY OR JASON NIGHTMARES, POSSIBLY EVEN THE TWO OF THEM SHARING THE SAME NIGHTMARE WATCHING THIS WORTHLESS EXCUSE FOR A FILM!

            "content": "I enjoyed this movie. It's not perfect, but I've not seen its like before, either. It's not a happy movie, but I think it has some parts to it stand out. The Rayne and Kagan characters are both memorable and make the movie worth watching Scenically, the movie is lush. The movie itself is brutal, but the settings are often beautiful.Plot-wise, it is a game movie -- heroic action/fantasy with a few somewhat \"indiana-jones-ish\" elements. For those that care about the bloodrayne games: the movie does include some elements from both bloodrayne games, and given that it's been declared a prequel to those games I'm not sure that was the best idea. In the long run using those elements here would make it difficult to use them in the sense they were used in the games. On the other hand some of the more obvious \"game elements\" are from other games. Some seemed like Nocturne (a sort of \"godfather\" game to the bloodrayne games).In any event, the plot was an important part of the movie, but it's emotionally where this movie is strongest, and weakest.The middle... was the weakest, emotionally speaking. If I had to rate the movie on the middle alone, I'd probably give it half the rating I'm giving it. It felt like exposition, and while it's possible in retrospect for me to step back from the movie and see how most of those parts fit, I found it bit hard to be engaged by the movie during the middle. Some of the characters were portrayed wonderfully, and some parts of the middle of the movie were just great, but some of the characters were portrayed in a fashion I found distracting. Maybe some people will have liked them, but not me -- at least not on my first viewing of the movie.I think the emotional impact of the first part of the movie was the strongest. The ending was good, but it was action-movie good, the beginning was far more emotionally engaging, in my opinion.And, ultimately, this is a movie about Rayne. She's ... some people won't like her. But I did. I'm not going to be able to describe this in detail without turning this into a spoiler, but the aspects of her character that some people are going to resent are what really make this movie.",

I mean, the only scene I found at all interesting was in the room with the eye, however, I found this movie to be QUITE flawed. For anyone who had taken the time to play the video game, this movie isn't anywhere near the same time-line. We all know/remember that the eye doesn't become a part of her until during the World War II time, when she's sent by the Brimstone Society to stop the Nazis from retrieving Beliar's parts, and when the eye became a part of her, it was a more painful experience. I honestly feel that the names and just a few facts have been driven from the game, but the game itself has been ignored. I know most who try to make movies based on games try to avoid becoming just the scenes from a game play out in real action, but... remembering that has caused this movie to leave me slightly... miffed. What's worse is, I waited for about two years for this movie to come out. What a waste! And why so many topless females?!",

            "content": "***CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS***One of my most favorite movies. Yes, it gad bad ratings on Flixster, here and rotten tomatoes, but I believe in watching it and making my own opinion and not listen to critics, because SOMETIMES they have really bad reviews for some of the greatest movies. Like this one.Okay. Kristanna is my favorite actress and being someone who watches about six to ten movies a day when home and writes most of the time, I have a good knowledge when it comes to great movies and really cheesy ones. Also Bloodrayne takes us away from all the main blockbuster movies and gives a low riding, entertaining movie about revenge. Examples - Jaws 4; The Revenge - is a really cheesy movie and shouldn't have been made. Trigolies are remembered better and they should have left it at three.Pirates of the Caribbean 2 - is one of the best. I don't care much for Orlando Bloom as some other girls my age do, so don't think that this is biased because he is in it. Effects, storyline, cast, plot and settings are all what make this movie great along with the actors and how they take on their roles.Now that you know I am not dumb and know what I saying, I'll tell you that this is a must see if you have any doubts about critics choice. WARNING; Based on the hit video game (Like Eragon, you can't copy everything down from a book or game for a movie, where is the creativity in that if they do?). BLOODRAYNE Based on the video game of the same name, the film centers on the character of Rayne (Kristanna Loken), an unholy breed of human and vampire called a Dhampir. Dhampir are unaffected by crucifixes and do not thirst for human blood. She is the daughter of the Vampire King Kagan (Academy Award Winning Actor Ben Kingsley) who has gathered an army of thralls, both vampire and human in order to annihilate the human-race. She was born when Kagan raped her mother and later witnessed him killing her.Sebastian (Matthew Davis), Vladimir (Michael Madsen) and Katarin (Michelle Rodriguez) are three members of the Brimstone Society who fight vampires. When they hear of the Dhampir, Vladimir plans to recruit her in order to kill Kagan. A great portion of the story concerns the three body-parts of an ancient vampire that can make a vampire free of the basic weaknesses: (holy) water (the eye), crucifixes (the rib) and the sun (the heart). As Kagan wants all these parts it becomes the heroes' mission to stop him from destroying the human world as they know it. With its great scenery and good effects this movie is a must see for fans of the game and vampire lovers. My rating is 10/10 for a movie well done.",

It was set in Romania, but almost everyone had an American accent.Just seeing the trailer was evidence enough that this movie was going to be terrible and of course it was. i just knew that i had to experience it being a hardcore gamer and a terrible movie lover. The whole idea of the brilliant actor known as Michael Madsen as a 19th century vampire sealed the deal that it was also poorly cast.There is one good thing about this movie; the incredible acting by Sir Meat of Loaf (or as i call him, Bitchtits from Fight Club)who played Leonid.

People who like blood and gore will like the effects though.The obviously aluminum swords the actors were using had visibly blunt edges that really looked cheesy. Monty Python had better looking weapons. You could actually watch them get dinged up during the duels, and during the close ups you could see the gouges in the metal. Guess they could not afford nicer swords for the close up shots.

I checked spoiler warning cause I don't know if I'll spoil or not, but the fact is, the movie is linked to the game FAITHFULLY. Resident Evil Movies weren't that great because they took TOO MANY LIBERTIES. Mario and Luigi movie sucked because of TOO MANY LIBERTIES. Doom sucked because of TOO MANY LIBERTIES. Bloodrayne plays like the fricken video game, only its acting, not 3D, and the control option is not there. I have to ask all the negative reviewers? How many of you know Uwe Boll?

He makes you pay your hard earned money to see over the top violence, confusing plot lines, and terrible miscasted acting. To make a movie this insufferable is like slapping everyone that sees it in the face.Unfortunately, Uwe Boll is untouchable. He won't actually come out and say that he hates everyone. Instead he plays it off as the victim. Until we can trap him into saying such, we can just boycott his terrible movies and question how he still has funds to make the huge flops that he self produces.

I can't disagree with criticisms that the acting was generally disappointing, especially Loken (who, overall really was quite awful), but I emphasise 'disappointing' rather than 'poor' because of two reasons. 1) the name actors may have been phoning in their performances and be poor by their own standards but for Rodriguez, Kingsly and Madsen even a phoned in performance is significantly better than many normal B-movie actors at their best and 2) given the script they had to work with no actor could have done much better! Yes, the script, the real villain of the piece ... (very bad) olde Englishe deliberately stilted phrasing and occasional modern-style one-liners are mashed together to produce some very poor dialogue, at times jarringly so, which really does not help us or the actors. I honestly think if the writing had been just a bit better the film would have benefited monumentally; much better and I think Uwe Boll might gain some converts to his cause! On to the rest of the film; the plot is not bad at all, if a little daft in places - some overlaps with the game (which I don't know) I could guess at as they were such 'gamey' concepts but at least that meant Mr Boll was trying a bit. The CGI and special effects are not ILM but are more than adequate, never really jarring and sometimes pretty good - though the (unexplained) montage at the end seem to suffer in that either they used 'longer cuts' of scenes from the film or the lack of score meant you looked more closely and were not 'caught up' because in the original sequences the make-up and prosthetics didn't look quite so obvious! The action is better than the average B-Movie with most fight scenes looking pretty good, the gore is very gory (I watched the Unrated version so don't know how much was cut for the R-Rated one), the naked women were very pretty and the ubiquitous sex scene (that admittedly seemed to appear from nowhere) was nicely done. So in conclusion, if you're looking at the cast and expecting top notch performances and associated high quality movie making, then you *will* be very disappointed. If you can get past some stilted dialogue and you're after a no-brainer B-movie with some fun, violent action and a few naked and topless women give it a try!",

But her flaws lies in her acting. One moment, she was feeble and weak and the next, she was Xena and then she become a damsel and then Buffy. How can Rayne looks tough and then weakens whenever someone empowers her?! She had her specialties and her skills but she truly doesn't know how to use her head. I'm disappointed, It gives bad name to one of my favourite game character.There's also a few characters who had less use in the movie (and non-existence in the game) who only acts as a side characters who does nothing but complicating the storyline.The script needs to rewrite since the character and the story lines are confusing and unrealistic.The ONLY thing that was not flawed in the movie is the outfit and the sets. However, Rayne looks too out of the time in her outfit and her hair do. Its medieval right? To director : Less out-of-the-story 'romance' and unrelated scenes and more gory and blood and character improvement.

And like the stupid ultimate fighter, I received a meaty, ham-fisted clobber across the face after the first 20 minutes.Make no mistake, this movie is BAD. Bad bad bad.

Listen, I'm not going to go into the details - the acting (merely bad), the scripting (idiotic), the sets (styrofoam dungeons!), the fight choreography (epilleptic!) or any of those things. No doubt they've all been harped on enough, and there's no point going on here.I rented this movie thinking roughly the following, \"I've never seen one of Uwe Boll's films, but you know, they can't be THAT bad. I mean, they keep letting him make movies, so there must be something good about them, huh?\" I was seriously mistaken. Just look at the average ratings here, and you'll notice a serious trend. It's not (as a Uwe Boll defender put it) some sort of 'Hate Club'. His movies are God-awful and it honestly made me want to start drinking heavily just to wash away the memory of having ever watched it. It physically hurts to remember it. I'd rather attempt with a rusty bread knife (starting from the groin) to cut myself in half than to even THINK HARD about watching this movie again.Look, I know that 90% of the 'user comments' here for this movie are something like overkill, so let me just close with this tiny observation (spoiler follows) and be done with it. At the end of the movie, Rayne sits down on a throne or some such and the camera zooms in on her face slowly - and then we're treated to a replay of EVERY scene in the movie that featured blood. That's a lot of flashback, so it's ridiculously long and boring. But during it, they flash back to one scene that I was certain I must've mis-remembered . . . but I didn't. There was a dismembered torso lying on the ground. Then you see a sword thunk down into the hay scattered all over the place beside the torso. \"Well, perhaps the torso wasn't quite dead enough - perhaps that fellow was a little overexcited and missed,\" you might think. But then, a moment later (perhaps another few swords thunked into the ground at this point, I can't quite recall) blood SPRAYS out of every orifice on the torso, as though it'd been dismembered between heartbeats. And then, \"thunk\", another sword hits the ground, and another . . . the camera pans up, away from the torso, and to the crowd of men who, in the midst of what we're led to believe is a raucous battle, have nothing better to do than hack at the ground around (I say again) a torso. As it pans all the way up, you see them . . . crazed with blood-lust, are they? So caught up in battle that their berserker rage causes them to attempt to hack the enemy (literally) to bits? No. No, quite the contrary. In a moment that's indicative of just about every horrible moment of this horrible movie, you see it's just a bunch of bored-looking extras, the thought playing through the forefront of their minds, \"I'm getting scale for this, but god, I wish I had a line or something.\" I would say that Uwe Boll should be fitted with a collar that will detonate and decapitate him instantly if he's within 15 feet of a camera, but sadly (dupe that I am) I'm intrigued by the preview for \"Postal\". Suicide, I believe, may be my only hope at this point.",

It's not the cream of the crop, but it still could become a guilty pleasure. You must leave all expectations for a vampire movie at the door, because it does not follow standard convention. It is based on a video game for starters, that means that anything goes. This is about Rayne and her quest for vengeance against her father, a head vampire, played very minimalistic by Ben Kingsley. There is a fair amount of blood and gore, especially in the unrated edition. There is some stilted dialog and some wooden acting. However, most of it comes from Michelle Rodriguez. And, Will Sanderson, is actually good as a lead henchman for Kingsley. It's not the most polished film, or best acted, but it definitely ISN'T the worst film of all time, as some hacks would lead you to believe. Most people want to bash Uwe Boll for his work, but I think he rather stays true to his vision. And besides, he funds his own films, so you can't beat him down for that. Still, there are a lot of people that write harsh reviews, some without even spelling actors names right. Those \"reviewers\" should realize they can spew all the unintelligent trash they want, but when it comes down to doing nothing or watching Bloodrayne, they'll have it in their DVD player faster than they can spell Kristanna Loken.

Even most of the violence in the film comes across as gratuitous, as does the sex scene -- and coming from me, that's definitely saying something. \"Bloodrayne\" gets a two from me rather than a one only because it does have very well-done sets, costumes, and some nice outdoor visuals.

I went into the screening with low expectations, and was very pleasantly surprised! I really liked BloodRayne! I had a great time watching it and enjoyed the story. I thought it was well paced with lots of action, gallons of blood, and some great fight scenes! It had some beautiful location shots, and a talented and eminently watchable cast! I didn't see anything wrong with any of the actors performances. And kristanna Loken was a great treat to watch-- performing most of her own stunts and fights-- (as well as that hot jailhouse sex scene!) I think she did a really good job carrying the bulk of the film.I also had the pleasure to meet and talk extensively to Uwe Boll, and was really impressed! A nice, unaffected, hardworking, smart, very hands-on, independent producer/director! Working outside of the studio system, raising tons of funds, getting great casts, and personally involved with all the distribution and promotions-- Boll is making entertaining films AND paying his investors back with dividends! So I don't really understand all the bad reviews? It seems to me that there's a lot of malicious and unjustified hatred of Uwe Boll. I know I've seen worse films, ( hell, I've acted in worse films!)

            "content": "BloodRayne (2005)####_General Notes_####Firstly, this movie is not nearly as bad as director Uwe Boll's previous movies, in particular \"Alone In The Dark\" and \"House Of The Dead\". The overall production is way better and all in all, this movie is more straight-forward than the others, which unfortunately doesn't mean anything considering the quality of \"AitD\" and \"HotD\". I hate reviewing a movie by largely comparing it other movies by the same director, but in the case of Uwe Boll it is probably the best way to go to get a fair view of the movie.On to the specifics of the movie, categorized in no particular manner.####_Dialog_####The dialog might not be as cheesy as in \"HotD\" or \"AitD\", but it still sucks. Ben Kingsley, who plays the evil vampire Kagan, appears like he is reading his lines off a cue card, after having taken a large dose of animal tranquilizers. Hands down the worst performance I have ever seen by any actor in any movie, ever. He just mumbles through his lines with no inflections, no pauses for dramatic purposes or any feeling at all. Actually, this is a nice reason to see the movie. There are a few laugh-out-loud moments thanks to Mr. Kingsley. The rest of the actors are not as bad as Kingsley, and some performances are actually not bad enough to distract too much. Obviously with the actors in this movie mostly everyone is performing way below what they are capable of.####_Cinematography_####The only decent part of the film. People wear clothes that look old and walk around in environments not containing paved roads. Looks 18th century to me. Approved.###_Directing and Editing_####In order to judge the skill level of Uwe Bolls directing and editing, the only example needed are the action sequences and sword-fighting in this movie. No one seems to be able to handle a sword, and in most sequences the bad guys attack someone, swing their sword once, then simply freeze and wait to get cut down. Camera angles and editing are generally incoherent and some actions by actors, due to editing, seem ridiculous. For example, someone lies down and fires a crossbow, cut to person being his by arrow, followed by a short fight between said person and another actor, AFTER which the person who fired the crossbow can be seen getting up from the floor, which means that he apparently just lay there on the floor for a while after firing the crossbow, whilst his comrades are engaged in life and death combat with swords and other dangerous weapons all around him. The action scenes are the least exciting parts of the movie, which might not be what the filmmakers were aiming for.####_Story_#### To be honest, I didn't care at all about the story. It wasn't explained at all the motivations of the \"good guys\", and why they did what they did, other than the usual \"Good versus Evil\" reason. As a consequence there is no tension at all in the story. It is just a standard story of revenge set in the middle ages with vampires.In short, the heroine Rayne (Kristanna Loken), a Damphir (half-human, half-vampire), watched her mother get killed by Kagan when she was just a small child. As an adult she wants revenge, but to do that Rayne needs to find some powerful artifacts left over from the body of a very powerful vampire who died a long time ago. These artifacts are stored at various random places, including a monastery where monks are guarding it.Needless to say, it is never explained why the monks, who are well aware of the powers of the artifacts, just don't destroy the bodypart/artifact they are guarding. I guess it could be any reason you can think of. It sure isn't explained by anyone in the movie. Anywho, the artifact at the monastery is obviously extremely powerful, which is why they have their best men guarding it. Actually make that \"man\". Yeah, they have one guard in front of the room where the artifact is. A sleeping guard. But hey, I guess that is enough, when you consider that the monks have booby-trapped the artifact room. But only with contemporary technology of course. Such as HUGE MANSIZED FREAKING RAZOR DISCS that crisscross through the room when set off by some ancient version of photocells. But hey, the monks have a lot of time on their hands so I guess anything is possible. I am not the one to second guess 18th century roman monks and what they can or cannot invent.The story goes on a bit more but does not make more sense. And I have probably forgotten some things. Either way, it doesn't really matter.Uwe Boll also throws in a sex scene for good measure, between Rayne and a person she is seen to speak with 2 times prior to it (still not as random as the AitD sex scene between Slater and Reid though).####_Final Thoughts_####In short, this is a horrible movie. It is amateur at best, and while it isn't fatally boring, I struggled to maintain interest. It is the best movie Uwe Boll has made, and to be honest it actually barely holds together, which is a great leap forward for Mr. Boll. But, this movie should only be watched by people who know they want to watch it, either just to see the latest Uwe Boll film (like them or hate them doesn't matter), or if you have a very high interest in vampires or any other part of the film that might stand out.2/10",

The special effects were awful and the blood in the film reminded me of something from Monty Python and the Holy Grail where blood just squirts from wounds. I don't know why the director is allowed to make a second film because the first one is just horrible. It's cheesy, poorly acted and again, the SE are some of the worst I've seen. This film isn't even good (read:bad) enough to gain cult status I think. I don't understand how anyone can rate this film above a 2, but I guess there is not accounting for taste. The ONLY thing this film is good for is turning into a coaster for my coffee table.",

Most comments on Bloodrayne here are so negative that it becomes ridiculous. How can you complain about the unrealistic settings when the movie what shot in Transylvania. It does NOT get any more realistic than that. Other complained about the bad acting: \"you could not sense the persons deep feelings and motivations\" and things like that... This is just plain stupid! BloodRayne is not a drama. It's a mix between a horror, action and fantasy-movie, based on a video game. Does anyone really go to the movies, or buy such a DVD to study the feelings of the heroes?? No, you see this kind of movies to get 95 minutes of fun and entertainment. And that's what you get here. Not more and certainly not less. OK, Bloodrayne has some small weaknesses. The Blades do not always look that sharp, the choreographies of the fights were not all top level (some were!), and some other details did not entirely satisfy me. But the cast was great, the photography impressive and the visual effect were so good that you mostly didn't even realize that it wasn't real. So if somebody writes that it's one of the worst movies (s)he has seen so far, that person must not have seen many movies. Has this person even seen BloodRayne??

I would rather have slept than to be exposed to that. All it shows is that Hollywood will push anything out they feel will bring in more than they fronted for the production of the movie.And to make it worse Uwe Boll is making a movie based on the game Farcry. I like that game, please please please please do not let him destroy the idea of it with another half-baked idea of action. Michael Pare is tagged to take the lead character. No offense, but he's a little past his prime and might break a hip or something. He was good in his day, but he's not cut out to do an action flick.",

I will start with one point that should offend any movie fan anywhere. This movie contains Ben Kingsley and Meatloaf . Oh I wish Kingsley's vampire character had feasted on a loaf of tar tare , but no I meant the \"singer\".Of course the \"plot\" is laughable. A sort of Angel meets Days of our lives. Also not that original . Yes , moody Troubled disaffected vamp broods about the unfairness of it all and the evil it is. I have to admit Kristanna Lokken looks better to me than David Boreanaz. Beyond that statement lies a compliment to Leelee Sobieski for simply knowing better. The rest of the cast is either half heart-ed or asleep at the frame. Who can blame them.I should give Billy Zane credit as the one who came off best , but I like him and don't want to insult his career by ever suggesting this turn is resume worthy.What did I expect?

Did you really believe a movie based on a video game---whom the movie industry hates worse than they hate comic books was going to get an Academy Award for of all things, Acting???????? It has taken nearly 25 years for a decent comic book based movie to come out---thanks to Stan Lee forbidding them to butcher his stories after they screwed up the TV Spiderman, Hulk and the First Punisher(Lundgren) Movie. Probably the majority of you never even played the game, or games like it. Did I like it???? Yes, the same way you love the ugly dog or the retarded kid who really is trying. Dir Boll should have dropped like 45 minutes of horseback riding, and substituted transitions with the coconuts from Monty Pythons Quest for the Holy Grail. I mean the movie had more horse footage than \"The Man from Snowy River\" I thought the movie was kind of \"describe who the hell we are\" for 45 minutes(which it did poorly) with about 20 minutes of actual fighting---which if you played the game it was mostly fighting with maybe 15 minutes of plot---between fighting(folks ripping it apart, you probably don't know what a game-master is, have never read a comic book, did fairly well in sports, and consider Titanic an epic event in the history of Cinema; why the hell are you at my movie?, a nerds subject?)I feel for Boll, he has attempted to film the unfilmable, a video game---which every time you play is different, unlike a book---which conveys the same message every time. Boll, if you read this--not likely--Keep Trying. Do Not Give Up. Talk to Stan Lee at Marvel, brainstorm with him, let him be your Ben Kenobi, or Yoda. He can help you develop your characters enough to not need top billed stars with drinking problems to sell your movies. Also, watch some raunchy porn, even those bottom rung directors know what to look for in a sex scene---you don't show everything, but you angle the camera so the audience assumes it's their fault---not the camera man hiding under a table. Last suggestion. NEVER HIRE YOUR WARDROBE PERSON AGAIN. You have Ms Loken, a gorgeous woman with great assets, and her costume goes from well, \"the pair of pajamas that you only take out when you are sick and have puked on your other ones\" to a loose fit gangsta pleather. Michele Pfeifer. CATWOMAN. Ben Afleck. DAREDEVIL. Jennifer Garner. ELEKTRA. LEATHER. TIGHT FITTING. ASS. TITTY. BATTLE DAMAGE. Your audience wants EYE CANDY. It's a movie, use your artistic license to alter the costume. It's a video game they will understand if you need to show more booby---the only reason they don't is they can't get an under 17 rating if they show more. I give you a six because I see where you are trying to go---and you do not have a lot of support, you need better support staff.Final Word Kristiana Loken--Booby, not plural, Yes!!!, don't have to hunt for Nip Slips Anymore. and her acting was not too bad. I think she is developing.----Don't take that as a try for Lady MacBeth, yet. another 5 years.---at least 4 movies more.",

One it could have disproved a certain British critic's law of 'all movies based on video games are trash', two it actually had some fairly talented cast members (say what you will of Meatloaf, I'll probably agree), and finally, Guinevere Turner is a very fine screenwriter.So I'm not certain what went wrong here... The cinematography is pretty nice, as is the set design in a very kind of upscale 'Hammer Studios' sort of way, the costumes are gorgeous (and I'll admit that Ms. L\u00f8ken's figure doesn't hurt that opinion, (average indeed... some people clearly haven't a realistic view) which is ONLY my opinion). The score is good; by a well-respected composer... the only answer I can come up with is Mr. Boll.Here we have an obvious effort by Turner to turn the story (Which is sort of very loose prequel to the arc of the game) into the classic horror trope of a rape/vengeance film, along side the potential to deal with all the deep seeded psychological issues of being a vampire, ESPECIALLY a half vampire, that even the said Hammer films deal with...and there are some hints of Turner's usual tropes dealing with gender and sexuality that are made rather brief and tawdry; surely it wasn't her fault very little of that made it on screen, and what did end up there, is largely Uwe's clumsily choreographed and shot fight-scenes with large amounts of suspiciously water fake blood. What was kept is there because it's 'hot', or gory. And we see far to little of Kingsly, and the other talent, even Rodriguez (who tends to be type-cast) is a far better actress than she appears to be here.So in the end it is mildly entertaining fluff, that feels very 'half-done', though markedly better than Mr. Boll's previous efforts.",

So far we've watched three Uwe Boll films. That's right, you guessed it BloodRayne, House of the Dead, and Alone in the Dark, all three terrible turds of a movie but all three unintentionally comedies of the highest caliber. BloodRayne is an absolute travesty of a film. The anachronisms are too many to point out, the acting...well, the acting can't be described in mere words, I'll just leave it at that. The screenplay is rubbish. Uwe Boll is a very bad director but I'm beginning to have a sick likening of him. It's so obvious he just wants an action packed movie with blood and cool fights, but even there he fails miserable but that is where the hilarity takes over.

It was set in the time of Automobiles and Nazis (30's /40's), while the movie was set in a Medieval... There was a plague in the game, which was not even mentioned in the movie! At the end of the game you face your main objective to defight some giant guy, again not mentioned in the movie, let alone based off the plot line of the movie, among with another leader/boss vampire guy (whos name also have forgotten)... You also fight lots of other 'bosses' like some slutty nurse lady that makes the plaugued people. Rayne she is by herself the hole time, with no sidekicks, just some references of her clan thing! You also meet a person who betrays her, a vampire and named Myn'c who plays as a friend of Raynes till the end of the game. One of the worst parts is that she doesn't have sex with the guy, let alone meet him. As far as the details go behind her history, I wasn't aware she came from a circus! Understand where I am headed. The game of alright. Maybe not many peoples cup of tea, but I enjoyed both it and the plot line. If you have watched this terrible series that Boll has created, play the games for yourself and compare. Very little similarities, enough where I wish what I was watching would not have been given remotely the same name!",

Considering Segal movies are given 3+ ratings, come on people... 2? The set design was good, the cast not bad, the slasher blood effects somewhat original for a cast and budget of this kind. It had some special effects, that were done properly. Is doing some elements that haven't been done for 25 years (raider's of the lost ark rip-off comment) really a rip-off. Good to see them again I say. What are you people expecting? It is a vampire killer movie! \"Oh it was as good as Cats!\" Please. Maybe there is a reason they took these roles... fun? I enjoyed this movie and people who are looking for a good medieval vampire slasher with a decent cast and decent budget... here you go. Don't expect Shindler's List or Ghandi because Kingsley has 10-20 lines in this. Kristanna Loken is gorgeous and does a decent, committed job. Enjoy. You won't have to listen to \"too cool for school\" Wesley Snipes give his moronic dialog for 2 hours. 6.8, 6.5, 5.7 BTW. Was Blade III 3.5 points better than this film, no.For the people that have given this such a low rating that it has averaged out at 2.2, give me a break. This is based off a video game. It is a vampire slasher. It has sword-play and martial arts. Compare it to movies of the same genre and then be fair.Reviews here are getting so picky (snobby) that it is hard to tell if a 5 rating is bad or not. Which it should be. I guess it is easier to pick something apart and sound like a \"true reviewer\" than to give a fair review. Too bad.",

What a surprise.No joke - This movie is hilarious. Watching the horribly directed and choreographed actors stumble around the sets belting out their lines like a bunch of sick cattle, listening to the oh-so-embarrassing and clich\u00e9 dialogue (example: \"If it's a war they want then a war they shall get\"), watching the terrible and annoying camera work jerk around and try to cover up the lack of choreography, pointless and excessive blood spraying out of random characters sitting back, probably thinking \"Oh, jeeze, what does a guy do when they get stabbed? Oh well, the blood will cover it up...\" and acting like \"Oh, jeeze, I've been stabbed. Well, damn it...\", Michael Madsen playing the seemingly pointless role of a guy wearing a mullet that really doesn't need to be in the movie other than to pound information into your head and offer second and third explanations about what we already know is happening (and have one of the worst performances, besides Meat Loaf), and having the main character enter a dungeon to find a random old fat guy sitting in a chair that she needs to fight and kill to get the trinket to advance to the next level had me rolling on the floor helplessly gasping for air. Yes, there actually are many parts that are extremely boring, but it's worth it to sit through that half hour of the movie to watch the other parts that are so gut-bustingly hilarious.One of the many problems in \"Bloodrayne\" is that it feels like a video game. Seriously, she has to collect three trinkets to advance through the \"game\", all the while fighting bosses and riding horses from level to level... It gets so bland and stupid feeling that the movie begins not to feel like a movie but more like a video game that you plop in - only to find out that you take no part in the actual game. It's ridiculous.As I briefly mentioned earlier, this movie is FILLED with clich\u00e9s. Seriously, you will sit there and have to listen to such lines as \"Keep your friends close, your enemies even closer\" while later in the movie suddenly a character that we've known all along as a good guy turns out to be a bad guy for no apparent reason other than the idiot director Uwe Boll thought it would add a surprise element to the plot. Oh, yeah, and while all these clich\u00e9s are being played out there's a bunch of gratuitous and out-of-place gore scenes everywhere that really come off as more annoying than powerful. But, I mean, it's still all really funny.And I will point out the fact of how horribly laid out \"Bloodrayne\" is. Basically, you start with a bunch of flashbacks (or maybe not flashbacks? I don't know...) and then our main character, Rayne, played by an actress who now probably has a dead career outside of Uwe Boll films from now on, Kristanna Loken, goes crazy and kills a bunch of people. Then the rest of the film is laid out basically level by level with a boss at the end of each one. Something happens, then a bunch of random shots of people riding horses, then something happens, then a bunch of random shots of people riding horses, then something happens... It is all laid out like this. The entire movie.This movie was obviously made without any effort. Serously, I won't give it away, but if you decide to watch this movie for a good laugh (the ONLY thing you will get out of it) then take notice to how hilarious, stupid, and thoughtless the part where Vladimir and Sebastian decide to escape. There is another part that is as stupid and thoughtless as that part, but I'm leaving you to find it. Hint: It has to do with a small box and a heart...Really, my main question is why this was released in theaters at all? It honestly feels like sub-B material with sub-B acting with a sub-B plot with a sub-B director, Uwe Boll. Which brings about another question: Why is this idiot still making movies? Honestly, there has to be some point where he'll just stop and realize that he can't blame his actors or scriptwriters anymore, that he can't say that fans can't be satisfied or that people are just picking on him because he's the German guy. He has to, unless he is a complete and utter idiot. The final question: why two stars instead of the one it deserves? Well, because the movie was damn funny.",

First of all, Rayne did not said one \"dirty\" word, she's not insulting anyone, movie lacks blood, violence, and most important, all the dialogs are stupid and too fake looking for a movie like this. Kristannas but looks too big in some scenes(She's not wearing leather costume like Rayne from the game, remember?), although she saved the movie (partialy) by showing her \"naturaly given beauty\",a.k.a. boobs(even they do not look so spectacular as they should). Ben Kingly looks too old to be acting Kagan, and that hair he's wearing looks, in best case, funny. Michael Madsen tried to make his role to be more impressive, but all of the actors were obviously limited by the script(which is, by the way a disaster).Meatloafs character (Leonid) seems to be having IQ under 20. Everything in this movie is quite crappy (not to say something worse). These are just a few bad sides, and if I carry on with listing, I'd probably broke the limit of 1000 words per a comment.For the end: As a film lover I can say that this is quite weak project, but as Blood Rayne fan I say: HOW DARE YOU, BOLL!

It's less easy to revel in the film that is mediocre than the film that is truly bad.

IT CAN'T BE TRUE!!! GOD HAVE MERCY ON MY SOUL AND KILL ME!!\" This is what I seem to get for staying home. I stay home for like two days on a weekend per year. One of these days is Christmas. Fatal mistake. The next fatal mistake was to assume that Uwe Boll movies would supply some sort of sick entertainment. I mean, I am proud owner of a Plan 9 DVD copy and it is my precious, yes young hobbitses. That is one bad film, but it is entertaining. You laugh, you watch it with your friends, you watch it with some other friends, you watch it with your girlfriend and you don't care because she is busy doing nice stuff to you. But with BloodRayne, I do not know.I would never ever put anyone through what I had to go through. I never experienced such stupid dialog, dumb delivery. There is no acting in this movie, there is just people who co-incidentally spoke some text while the camera was running. There is no direction whatsoever. There are shots of horses' asses talking to each other (time and again in the voice of Michael Madsen). And it looks so bad. And it hurts the eye. The music is like on a loop and never matches the action. The editing is awful and pointless (what's with the ending anyway??). The CGI was done on a C64. And it looks OH SO BAD!! I have never ever never ever seen a film that looked so unpleasant to the eye and I am an 80s film freak, when films looked oh so bad. It is unbearable! There was some suspense in it. I wondered if Ben Kingsley would ever move (or blink his eyes for that matter), that kept me awake for most of the movie. There was some gore in it, thanks to Mr Ittenbach. But he should have directed it too, because his earliest amateur movies are better than this crap. I urge you all: before you see a film you don't explicitly like and prepare yourselves bashing the poor director writer actor whatever - take a look at this and writhe in pain.By the way: I spent a week of watching three video game-to-movie, urm, movies. Silent Hill was anything but perfect, but stylish and okay. Doom was anything but okay, but had a great FPS sequence and solid action to pull you through. But BloodRayne? It is not even a movie by today's standards. I read that Boll is just pulling off a giant tax scam (my money by the way, since I am German). Now, there is a gazillion ways of evading taxes, why, oh merciful lord in heaven, does it have to be us, the movie goers, to bear the consequences? I cannot say anything more.

Oddly enough these are the only two item out of the five you must find that endow Simon with special power. Dracula's Eye lets Simon enter some areas he couldn't before (Like Rayne can now walk in water) and Dracula's Rib acts as a shield against projectile attacks (Rayne gains super-vampire strength once she has the rib).Let's face it folks, this proves once and for all Uwe Boll is not only a bad script writer and director, he's a thief to boot.

Billy Zane fits in that category for sure, in the 3.5 minutes he is actually in this movie, with the worlds worst wig. I honestly can't believe I watched this train wreck. The blood is sooooooooo fake. There is one scene with monks fighting, you can see the JEANS under their robes! Could they have possibly spent less $ on the excessive quantities of bad looking blood, and more on some pants? And Michelle Rodriguez, she cannot act, not 1 bit. She ruined the TV show LOST, and she is less than useless in this movie. And whomever taught her how to sword fight needs to be beat with a stick. The only other redeeming thing in this movie is seeing Meatloaf Aday act as a vampire pimp...yes, you heard me, a vampire pimp with his own vampire harem...do I need to say more about this travesty of film?",

The negative reviews going around are based on two things - biased \"reviews\" from people who haven't even seen the movie, and reviews from biased people who have some kind of grudge with the director. (Who IMO, does a good job of bringing video games to the big screen.)The story is here, the action is here, and the sex appeal is definitely here. You have to see the cat fight between Rayne and Katarin (Michelle Rodriguez) to believe it. Sexy and looks good! That fight scene will be stuck in my head for a long time.Really to be fair about things, if you're even slightly interested in Bloodrayne and curious about it, do yourself a favor and go see it. The only real way to know if you like a movie or not is to see it yourself, not listen to biased reviews from people who simply have their own personal opinion on things. We've all got different opinions so some may like it some may not. But to say there's no story would be incredibly unfair. It's there. The acting is there. The visuals and sexiness are definitely there (they compliment any vampire movie very well) and my god, again, that cat fight between Rayne and Michelle Rodriguez.. Believe me, while I woudn't claim this to be a \"perfect\" movie, it's definitely far from a bad one. Just as I was there opening day of the release, I'll be getting the DVD the first day it comes out. Now here's to hoping there will be a sequel!",

But here's what I thought about the movie (and I am not commenting about Uwe Boll because I don't really know anything about him. I am just the average moviegoer ...1. The cinematography is actually quite good. The panoramas, the setting shots, and some of the set shots are actually raise your expectations of the movie.2. The dialogue is quite bad. It's not the worst I have ever witnessed, but some of the characters are horrible. Both the script and the actual dialogue (particularly Vladmir) is stilted, fake, and poor. Kristanna Loken's (Rayne's) dialogue is sub-par, but not the worst. Katarin's dialogue is actually well done and her acting is probably among the best in the movie. Kagan (Ben Kingsley) does a pretty good job of his role - it's a little forced, but decent.3. The violence (aka blood-sprays) STRONGLY detract from this movie. It would have been so easy to take out the super-fake blood spraying and make the movie much more watchable. Some of the wanton (and unexplainable) violence/killing could have been avoided and actually benefited the movie.4. The Choreography was actually decent in most cases. Some of it sucked (particularly when Rayne is trying to look powerful and fails miserably).5. I am a typical guy, and Kristanna Loken looked SUPER hot in this movie. Her first outfit ... (drool) ... but her later \"better\" outfit was actually worse and less believable. For skin-freaks out there, there is a lovely few moments of delicious Kristanna-breast-baring and a scene with Meatloaf and a naked harem of relatively tasty treats (among the thoroughly dessicated bodies).6. The plot is pretty good. It tries to maintain the storyline of the game (which I played and enjoyed), but it has some grievious flaws. The game is centered around modern time whereas the movie is set some time in medieval Europe. Not so good. But if you overlook this (and a few other points), the story is fairly engaging, particularly if you compare it to other B flicks.Overall, I did enjoy this movie. But only going into it expecting (and willing to overlook) some of it's obvious detractors. So if you want to see it, try to see past the crappy blood-spraying and try to enjoy the movie. It is NOT Underworld on any level.8/10 for a B movie; 2/10 for an A movie.",

Or better yet, scream \"Uuuuuwwweeee!\", both a cry of disgust, and the name of the man behind this monstrosity of a picture.It's amazing how Dr. Uwe Boll continues to make movies, and convince producers that they should sign him for their film. He has had three Hollywood films in the last three years, all of them floundering at the box office, and also appearing at the same time on the IMDb's Bottom 100 List (All 3 are currently in the bottom 20!). An achievement that would send any new filmmaker pack his bags and head back to his hometown. However, it seems Dr. Boll is unaffected by this lack of success and viewer's distaste for his films.

If you're a fan of bloody-action movies, and in particular B grade action movies, then you should enjoy Bloodrayne for its' other qualities. The action sequences are well choreographed and pulled-off by the actors and stunt doubles. There is a ton of blood, and I mean literally \"a ton\". If you like cheesy action shots where someones head gets crushed with blood splattering everywhere, and brain pieces flying about, then you MUST watch this movie. To top it all off, there is a respectable amount of nudity. Some people have called it soft-porn, but while one scene shows some rather believable sex, I found all of the nudity to be in good taste, and it fit the film rather well. Simply put: if you have a single Troma movie in your collection, pick up Bloodrayne(Unrated version).",

Michelle Rodriguez Has been in numerous films which though not always the best are usually worth watching. This just goes to show you that even good actors have to put food on the table. Bloodrayne is a movie containing a horrible plot(or no plot really for that matter), beyond awful acting, and some of the worst action and special effect scenes ever put into film. If they were going for cheesy they didn't put enough into it. You know a movie is bad when even a person such as myself who loves cheesy movies is disappointed. numerous times I found myself drawn to my PSP or wanting to watch CNN(which has more plot and better special effects). Heres the whole movie. Halfling vampire/human in a carnival sideshow. She breaks free. Finds some magical stuff. Then she is approached by vampire hunters. She decides to help the vampire hunters. Battle ensues. Treachery blah blah. Final battle (Ben Kingsley/Kritanna Loken). No ending whatsoever?? her sitting on a throne...WTF? This gets 1 point out a scale of 100.

After watching it, I wonder how in the world did these great actors and actresses get sucked into making this movie as its an embarrassment to their talents.

This was first time I some nocturnal dude that couldn't drink anything except blood. And coffee and orange juice, I guess. Maybe vodka and wine. But no water. At least no baths.It was very disturbing to see the vampire thirst thing in action. They no longer have to actually suck their victims. Their fangs only have to come within three or four centimeters of their victim's neck and, PRESTO! The victim in question immediately falls unconscious, screams in agony, and otherwise dies. Watch BloodRayne to see the vampire non-contact sport.The entire acting energy was also definitely in question. Enter Madsen. Bloodrayne says, \"Think we ought to save the world?\" Madsen kind of stares around the room, apparently looking for a better role. BloodRayne says,\"So... I guess we better go fight some bad guys, huh?\" Madsen says some deadpan line, hoping it makes him look tough, but comes across as bored. \"Well, we could just ride some more horses.

Most people point the finger at the director and blame him for such drivvle, but the actors, some of who are revered amongst their peers (Ben Kingsley, Micheal Marsden and Michelle Rodriguez to name the ones most noteworthy) should be ashamed. The script was hardly riveting and I am sure each actor struggled to get excited by it. But as a professional actor you have to at least try and make it believable. The entire film came across as though they were reading from cue cards!! Almost as though they couldn't be bothered to learn their lines and emote whilst reciting them! So why didn't this get one star instead of two? I did put awful in the title so rightly should give it only one star! Frankly the fighting was not bad! The sword play, despite using ugly weaponry that a five year old could have put together using toilet rolls and masking tape, was alright. The story line was alright - until she turned herself in towards the end! Seemed to not be a smart move but apparently she had a 'plan' when she did it. But perhaps the one part of the film that had passion and was even only slightly refreshingly realistic was the sudden sex scene at the cells of the Brimstone HQ.Seriously, I wouldn't bother with this film unless you enjoy rubbish acting and generally poor movies.",

This movie had effects that were so low budget that there is not a comparable movie that has been made in several decades (I'm sure someone knows of a recent movie, but I don't). Once you combine that with a story that just drags on and on (like this review?) it's just not pleasant to watch. I have tried to watch it a second time to see if maybe I was just expecting more, but couldn't even make it half way before I was finding another DVD to watch (I think I made it 15-20 minutes). In my defense I've only bought one other movie without seeing it (equlibrium) which was fairly good, and I figured \"it has that chick from T3, cool\". Well I highly recommend running and screaming from this movie",

He was killed and torn apart centuries ago, his parts scattered around the world.2: Kagan.

            "content": "Inexplicably, Uwe Boll managed to attract several well-known actors to this project: Ben Kingsley (Gandhi, House of Sand and Fog, Polanski's Oliver Twist), Michael Madsen (Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill), Michelle Rodriguez (Resident Evil, TV's Lost), Billy Zane (Dead Calm, Titanic, Tales from the Crypt presents Demon Knight), Udo Kier (Suspiria, Blood for Dracula, Shadow of the Vampire), Michael Par\u00e9 (Streets of Fire), Meat Loaf (Fight Club) and Geraldine Chaplin (Doctor Zhivago, Nashville), as well as Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines star Kristanna Loken in the title role. Apart from Billy Zane, who does not seem to take it all as seriously as the rest of the cast, they are all terrible. In fact, they should be ashamed of themselves. Kingsley is so bad you wonder how this man ever managed to get an Academy Award. (It makes you feel that maybe there should be a recall option on Academy Awards, in case an awarded actor later in his/her career shows that he/she is truly not worthy.) And Geraldine Chaplin, in her one and only scene, manages to give a worse performance than Loken does, which is quite a feat. In one of movie history's worst exposition scenes, Chaplin's fortune teller out of the blue appears and explains the plot to Loken (and the audience). Loken's Bloodrayne, clearly as nonplussed as the rest of the audience, then asks \"Why are you telling me all this?\", which gets the following reply from Chaplin, \"Because it is my purpose!\" In a video game this might have worked, in a movie it does not. Loken is not that experienced an actress, and getting directions from Uwe Boll this early in her career must be near-equivalent of a career suicide. No one in their right mind would cast Loken in a major role again after seeing what she does in this movie. Apart from Boll himself, of course, who has cast her in his next movie, In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale. Par\u00e9 is unrecognizable in his pointless 5 seconds of screen time, and Meat Loaf is truly an embarrassment to watch as vampire Leonid. Madsen seems bored and uninterested, and that's the most positive thing there is to say about his performance. Rodriguez just seems confused and uncomfortable. (\"What am I doing here?\" \"Should I do an English accent, an American accent, or a little bit of both?\" \"Am I a good guy or a bad guy?\") In addition to the truly dreadful acting, just about everything else in the movie sucks too. Boll has made some truly mind-boggling decisions when it comes to editing choices; why he chose to show Bloodrayne's escape from the carnival as a series of flashbacks (and even flashbacks within flashbacks) is anybody's guess. The only thing this accomplishes is making the whole mess even more incomprehensible. How much Guinevere Turner's (American Psycho, TV's The L Word) screenplay was altered by the good Mr. Boll is hard to say, but in the hands of another director this might have been just another bad movie, instead of one of the worst ever committed to celluloid.",

Bloodrayne seemed to be destined to become a highly praised blockbuster. But Uwe Boll stood on its way and failed to execute any of its good features properly into a movie. First of all I should mention the main character of the franchise. In the video games Bloodrayne is a sexy dampire in really good physical shape. She is witty, impudent, sharp-tongued. I don't say Kristanna Loken is a bad actress, but she reveals none of these features in the movie. Why didn't she train to be in good shape in the movie? She was so sexy and slim in Terminator 3, but here all we see is a fat belly jutting out of the \"meant-to-be-sexy\" Bloodraye red and black costume and a flat shapeless bottom. Of course the way she fights being like this looks very clumsily and awkward. As for the nature of her character, she is shy and modest, nothing similar to the red-haired devil which produces sharp remarks while cutting enemies in halves. On the whole acting in the movie is good, way better than in the 2nd and the 3rd parts. Udo Kier fits the role of Kagan really good, he seems to be one of the few good features of the movie. Michelle Rodriguez is a hostile and mean strong woman, no wonder, almost all character she plays are the same. Bloodrayne's companions portrayed by Michael Madsen and Mattew Davis look natural and interesting enough for the viewers to empathize with them. The plot is quite boring and the setting is very trite for a vampire movie (especially in comparison with the setting of the first Bloodrayne video-game). But at least the there is some plot here, it creates a complete story, in contrast with Bloodrayne 2 and 3. I really dislike the weapons used in the movie, all swords look as if they were borrowed from a poor puppet theatre. Kids' plastic swords look no less realistic sometimes.Anyway, today, when I have already seen Bloodrayne 2 and 3 I can say that the first part is not that awful as it seemed to be from the first sight, but as a movie about our beloved redhead vampire Bloodrayne it is an inexcusable fail.",

The acting is uneven, good in some places, mailed in in others. The story is pretty disconnected, as each scene seemed to be in chronological order, but did not flow very well.There were pluses to this movie. The landscapes and cinematography were absolutely gorgeous. They obviously did not skimp on the sets (other than the castle where they meet the greedy, lusty vampire). They actually got some half decent actors for the movie.Overall, I felt like I was watching a movie that was missing some things. They didn't seem to have the budget needed to make the movie they wanted, and they didn't seem willing to compromise the story they wanted to tell, and that hurt the movie. I would love to see the raw footage, to see if someone else could edit it into a more cohesive story.

I regret to inform the cast and crew of Bloodrayne that that will not be the case here.This movie leaves me to question the criteria and standards of movie producers and those that allow for a movie to be made. I'd like to know what kind of hallucinogen pushed whoever gave the go-ahead to this horrid movie. How am I to materialize a reality where those that put out \"Star Wars\" are classified under the same occupation title as those that put out \"Bloodrayne\"? Bloodrayne is most definitely the type of movie that wins bets. What I mean by that is this. \"I bet you that Bloodrayne is the worst movie ever.\" \"No way!\" \"Seriously...\" But seriously, there was no coherence and it could simply be described as an ADHD gamer's screenplay of his fantasy of the game.

You will follow me. We can not allow ourselves to be seen. I must not lose my lunch over this lame script.\" There's really nothing good to say about the acting in this stinker - even Ben Kingsley looks embarrassed, as he should. Michael Madsen looks like an overweight has-been from a bad 80s hair band; or maybe he's just trying to upstage Meat Loaf. Even Kristanna has a little pooch, and the camera direction deftly calls attention to it several times throughout the movie.The utterly gratuitous and over-the-top graphic depictions of dismemberment and mutilation are better suited to the exploitation/zombie genre than this this attempt at mainstream adventure. In one scene we see about four people hacking the limbs off a very dead and disemboweled foe - in the middle of a pitched battle, mind you. Geez, you'd think you'd have other priorities when there's live sword-wielding enemies all around than chopping a harmless corpse into progressively smaller pieces.Uwe Bolle is evidently so proud of his gross-out scenes that he actually revisits them in a five-minute montage at the end of the movie.

            "content": "Movie wasn't as bad most people say it is. Yes, it's not the best movie (BY VERY FAR), but it is one of the better bad movies put there. Compared to his U.S. debut film, House Of The Dead, he's come around quite a bit. Sure, the gore scenes were odd and comical to watch at a point, but having played the BloodRayne games themselves, it actually matches up fairly well. The concept of the game battles are usually dismemberment and blood everywhere; in other words, over the top and tedious at some point. Same thing in the movie. Not a good point for the movie, but it's also something acceptable about it.However, the problem with the fight scenes is not the gore; it's the props. Yes, the props. The swords look bulky and dull. Another problem with fighting is that we've seen some of the shots in other movies. In the final fight, two men hit their swords together, with one breaking the conflict by punching his opponent. This shot previously appeared in the lava battle in Star Wars Episode 3. Yet another shot used is the 'Scorpion Kick' that Kingsly is hit by. This shot was in the two Matrix sequels. The end result are fight scenes which seem 'cheeseball'. The CGI effects blend and don't blend continuously throughout the film. A good example is the 'Entering the castle' shot. The exterior of the castle looks believable, but the gargoyle entrance doesn't look like it can exist.And yes, there are many inconsistencies between the games and the movie, but what video game movie HASN'T been inconsistent with it's game counterpart? I don't believe Lara Croft rode on a Jetski in a bikini in any game, nor did any Hunters or the Tyrant appear in either of the Resident Evil movies. (And don't go into Nemesis being a Tyrant.) No character by the name of 'Alice' exists in any RE games.Of course, a bad flaw in this movie was the acting. Ben Kingsly's dialog about sending his warriors after Rayne seems so incredibly dry and literally sounds like it was read off of a script because it sounds so flat. The 'sex scene' does seem out of place, not in the context of the movie, but in the context of the scene. It seems so random that it makes the viewer feel bored. There's no sense of sexual tension between the characters, and so it feels as though it could have been left out entirely, or at least put in after some new character tweaks. Madsen seems believable, but at the same time not. His looks and acting often offset his appearance, either one outweighing the other in many scenes. Meat Loaf's appearance was actually pretty cool, even though it was quite brief. Loken was another believable character, as was Rodriguez.For those who found the ending to be odd, it was. Rayne seems to hate mankind, but throughout the movie she is aided by humans and seems to only hate vampires. Although one could say that she hates both, because of the story so far, the scene once again feels misplaced.Many people vote on this and other Boll movies based on what they have heard from others without actually seeing the film. People also vote on what they think it SHOULD be, not what it is. Obviously, if you're going to see BloodRayne, you should be expecting to see a bloody, gory movie, in which case it delivered. But what's the saddest is something that Mr. Boll has pointed out; this movie was down voted by hundreds of people before it's initial release. Limited advance screenings were shown worldwide, and I seriously doubt that most people who down voted it before it's initial release saw the movie, just the trailer (IF that). What I'm saying is that it's all well and good to dislike his work, just at least give it a chance before you start to critique in a negative or positive way. All in all though, this was a decent movie that will appeal to game fans and those looking for a large amount of gore.",

It would prove more of a challenge to find something positive to say about Bloodrayne than taking a masters in quantum physics. I saw this nightmare on a Pc. (No one shall say I paid to watch the crap). House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark, two of Uwe Bolls other blunder ups had already left me with deep scars in my soul. So I guess I had it coming. It seem rather pointless to analyze this excuse for a movie because there isn't much to analyze. The part most people remember or feel worth talking about is the sex scene. Which explains a lot. Even that wasn't remotely decent. The breasts of Kristanna Loken just ain't gonna cut it as long Uwe Boll is lurking behind the camera. Nor will anything else. And I can't for the life of me phantom why Michael Madsen which I think of as an decent actor would diminish him self by accepting a part in this garbage. Is quick money the only reason, then buddy, this isn't going to help your career. Michelle Rodriguez was I felt, the only one who gave the impression of at least trying. But only A list actors can carry a movie by them selves. But no cosmic power could carry Bloodrayne anywhere.Uwe Boll has threaten the world with upcoming game to movie project like Far Cry, Postal, and Dungeon Siege. At least he was tuned down brutal and hard by the people behind the master piece Metal Gear Solid. (There is a god). If one really want to waste money and time on crap movies I rather see an Ed Woods movie. At least he was in a bizarre way somewhat good at being bad.",

I give credit to Uwe Boll for taking on the task of bringing in a video game to film but he should do more work on the casting of the film and the dialog. People acted as if they didn't really mean the lines they said and it felt like there were reading off a page behind the camera.I have no idea what sort of setting he his trying to get at. The characters voices and images did not match the setting of the film. They all had their own accent i.e. Michael Madsen (American), Michelle Rodriguez (Spanish/American), Kristanna Loken (American), Ben Kingsley (English/U.K.). It also seemed that the characters did not really fit their role. It was hard to connect with Kristanna Loken and her being Bloodrayne. I had the expectation that she was going to be more attractive and seductive like other female vampires have been portrayed in other movies.I compare this movie to some of the cheaper Hong Kong Films that are produced on an annual basis. The blood and gore in the movie was quite prevalent. There were two sex/nudity scenes in the movie that were really quite unnecessary and were not built up very well. It was nudity for the sake of nudity. Some of the camera angles could have been better. And for the final thing that was bad, the ending. If you are expecting something great don't get your hopes up.I hope Uwe Boll does better on his next film as this movie could of had more direction and attention to detail to make it better.",

Can anyone tell me where to find him? Really, the best part of this movie was getting to see Kristanna Loken's boobies, and though they're pretty nice, that alone wasn't worth the $5.75 I paid to see the movie. That's why I gave it a 2 -- if they'd been on screen longer, I may have even given it a 4.How sad it is when a director is able to get this cast together with all the potential of this particular video game franchise, and this is the result he gets. No script, poor dialogue, no flow, the action sequences didn't even live up to the game, and the characters were all so wooden that it was painful to even think about caring about them. And I'm certain it's not the fault of the actors in this case.The difference between Uwe Boll and Ed Wood is that there is some redeeming entertainment value in Wood's films. I bet if you threw Elvira in with the cast of MST3K, they couldn't even do anything with it. I am embarrassed for everyone involved. It could have been so much more.",

The cover looked really nice, the trailer was cool, and the storyline itself had the potential to be very engaging. Who doesn't like the idea of a half-vampire kicking a bunch of vampire butt? Blade anyone? What I got was a dismal piece of crap. The acting was poor, the special effects were cheesy, and the storyline was horribly mutilated. In addition, the production quality was made for TV grade. Why in the world did anyone even think this stood a chance in theaters? The only thing saving this movie is the protagonist, played by Kristanna Loken. She pulls off an attractive, deadly but lost Rayne. At best, you can take all the shots with her in it and make a nice YouTube collage. At least people would watch that in its entirety.I wish this had been released as a made for TV movie for the Sci-fi channel. I would have considered this a moderate quality movie for that venue, and may have actually enjoyed it in that case because it would have matched my expectations. Instead, I get the cheesiest storyline and gore seen in the box office since the 80's. Two out of 5 stars only because Loken pulls off a decent performance.",

It is one of the few video game inspired scripts to generate a full, rich storyline for the big screen. The pace of the film was consistent, with a good mix of action and story. The dialog contains a delicate, artful balance of period and modern language, that takes the viewer back in time without making them feel that every resident of Romania was British.The cinematography, lighting, sets, and costumes were all beautiful. Great attention was given to nearly every detail. Unlike films such as Doom and Wing Commander, I was drawn into the world created by the film. They all come together to create a dark, realistic environment, where you expect a vampire around every corner. The one shortcoming in this realm is that all of the bladed weapons in the film look to be stamped out of sheet metal rather than forged.The acting, while not Oscar caliber, was convincing. Matthew Davis and Kristanna Loken did a particularly good job of bringing their characters to life. The biggest disappointment of the film was unfortunately that ,like the blades of the swords, the usually brilliant Michael Madsen's performance was completely flat.

Plenty of decapitations, limbs being removed, maces to the face, arrows through eyes and exposed rib cages fill the screen in glorious color.

I suppose this goes to show that having big names is no substitution for a well written script. For example, Band of Brothers was fantastic and contained almost no big names.

The premise behind it is OK however the acting and story is so painful it makes white noise look like an acadamey award winner. In conclusion If you feel that you want to rent or God forbid buy this film do yourself a favor take your money light it on fire and poke yourself in your eyes it will be much more fun trust me!",

            "content": "I'm thankful that I only rented the movie BloodRayne and didn't pay the $6 to go see it in theaters or the $20 to buy it. Luckily I spent a measly $3.49 plus tax to participate in the worst movie experience of my life. You're assaulted by the most unlikely vampire hunting trio ever invented. Fans of the hit TV series will instantly recognize Michelle Rodriguez who plays the sometimes good-guy/bad-guy cop Anna-Lucia. Next in line is Michael Madsen, an actor who usually can be trusted for a decent B-movie performance but his forced accent and too proper English mixes for a sadly eye-gouging experience. The last to mar the screen is a not so well known Matthew Davis, you're average hero who has a shady past, falls in love with the main character within seconds of meeting her and in the end dies. What appalled me beyond words was that a very well respected actor actually appeared on the screen. Two if you know your film history. Ben Kingsley appeared as the evil-doer while Udo Kier played the head monk. Both actors I admire greatly but it feels as if they bashed their heads against the walls repeated when they accepted these roles. The fighting scenes were unimpressive and awkward at best. Rayne seemed to be a character torn between bad-ass and damsel in distress. The story line was clich\u00e9d and the only one worth delving into more would be the one between Michelle Rodriguez and Billy Zanes characters. Now all that is horrible enough, but had there been a more talented director,it could have been a tiny bit better, only a tiny bit though, my friends, but the insipid script had me nigh vomiting during the entire film. The appearance of Meatloaf, was well anticipated, but the under-clothed woman that the director decided to drape on him was despicable. Not to mention the vulgar and sordid scenes that accompanied him were a bit, no, not a bit, but ineffably depraved and boarding on lecherousness. I thought smart directing was in this year, but with the inaccuracy of the blood spurting out in a fine mist or jet propulsion in areas not containing a major artery was laughable. In a day and age where modern medicine and technology reign supreme it was sadly lacking in believability. In all honesty, I know movies are supposed to ring of unrealism, but this was, to say the least, stinking of a high schooler's fantasy on a low budget. By now, I hope my criticism hasn't bored you to tears, or if you've seen it before, make you laugh so hard you cry. It is my belief that not even the sci-fi channel-who \"raynes\" as the emperor of bad sci-fi movies-would show this. And I haven't even begun to mention, the same old dull, unoriginal plot line and character development. Royal bloodiness, my hands are getting tired. I am not yet done.",

The writing was horrible, very basic and uninspiring. Most of the characters seemed to have far too much knowledge, leaving little mystery to those not already familiar with the story as well as raising questions: If they already knew this or that, why have they not at least tried to do something about it at an earlier date? The actors all seemed stiff, bored and unimpressed with their situation. I felt no passion from them while delivering their lines. Most of the fighting sequences were poorly choreographed and made the vampires seem like a bunch of wimps. Unfortunately, this film like so many others based on comics or video games came out on the big screen looking like some college students film project rather than a professionally produced, written and directed effort. This sadly was one of those films that I walked out of the theater thinking, \"Wow! I wish I could have that part of my life back.\"",

It's more like a mix between Brain-dead-gore (unrated version), Buffy the vampire slayer and a kind of.. what can i say ? Martial arts with too much gravity.You get the feeling that they really messed up the \"special effect fighting\" here.. Everything goes slow and it looks sooo hard to do and soo painful to move around.. Together with Loken's face expressions and screams.. you definitely see that this didn't work the way it should.Anyhow.. as i agree on other comments.. it's \"watchable\" and gives the entertainment if you don't expect any serious end-of-the-world movie here..Grab a few beers with some friends and get ready for a couple of laughs and fun :) Cheers!",

I am trying to understand if the movie was really based off the video game or a rip off type. I was not impressed with the clothing that Rayne wore at all and the weapons kinda upset me. If you look at the video game the swords she has don't have metal at the back end they are strapped to her arm and in the movie they are bladed on the back. Rayne is also portrayed as an ass-kicking half breed and in the movie she is a timid bad fighter that needs to be taught. Also didn't like how they were basically set in two different time periods. They could have done a better job.",

I was only able to stomach about an hour of this \"movie\" until I had to turn it off. I don't know how someone could edit that and say \"Yeah, that is the movie I want to display to the world.\" Everyone in this movie seems completely uncomfortable in their fighting scenes (even Kristianna Loken\u0085you know, the MAIN CHARACTER) it's almost physically painful. This movie seems like a first year film students aborted final exam. It's a shame since there is so much that can be done with the BloodRayne theme if it's given to someone competent. This Uwe Boll just butchered it like it was last weeks road kill. Come on Uwe, BloodRayne is supposed to be very smooth, sleek and sexy not slow, arthritic, and probably about 5 \u00bd beers shy of a six pack. Kristianna Loken was probably the ONLY good thing in T3, so where did it go wrong in this movie???? Anyway, you get the basic idea on this pile of wasted time.",

His delivery is pretty much the same in all his movies and worked pretty well for most of them. Not so much here. OK, not at all. Every time he spoke I laughed. I hear this was supposed to be a video game before. Maybe that's where Madsen's inspiration came from; the flat, dry voice acting in almost every single video game ever made. Then again, it's Michael Madsen, so who the hell could really tell? Maybe he was drunk or just disinterested, thinking \"How the Hell am I in this movie?\".The other actors didn't seem to try much more. Meat Loaf was only on screen for like 2 minutes but he seemed to put more into his character than anyone else. And that's not saying a lot. The lead actress might as well have been playing another robot. Michelle Rodriguez did OK, but then again she's like Madsen--the same delivery in every movie. Ben Kingsley performed his duties as an actor, as he always does, and collected his pay. Oh yeah, Billy Zane is in this movie too. Billy Zane---think about that for a few seconds.....'nuff said.It's not like any of the actors had a lot to work with though. All the lines were like they were being repeated by six virgins playing D&D at the Dungeon Master's parents' dining room table. Seriously, THAT bad. This could have been a decent movie in some other time and some other place. OK, probably not there either. Ultimately still it's all the director's fault. House Of The Dead.....Alone in the Dark.....now BloodRayne. Thank god I didn't actually pay to see or rent any of these movies outside of my monthly cable/internet bill.",

The only reason BR outshines RS is the actors surrounding the heroine - Ben Kingsley and Michael Madsen on their worst days (and they came pretty darn close to those days in this movie) can out-act Ahnold's early days (pre-\"True Lies\").The storyline had potential. The writers did absolutely nothing with that potential, but it was there. On paper, the list of actors was strong - Kingsly, Madsen, Michelle Rodriguez, Billy Zane - but when you get a list like that and Michelle Rodriquez puts out the best stuff with the absolutely worst part, you know it was a sad day for fantasy fans. The scenery was very nice. The effects absolutely horrible. A previous reviewer noted the spurting blood in both BR and Kill Bill (Vol 1). Because Torentino approached his violence in an almost comic book-like approach, the outrageously spurting blood fit. With BR, though, it was as if the director couldn't figure out how to do gore in a manner that would actually make the viewer cringe from it. To over compensate, he told the special effects folks to turn on the sprinklers.Kristanna Loken was about as good as one could expect - a pretty face and great body squeezed into leather running around with a sword. As an actress, she was better in the Mortal Combat series, and much better in T2 (but then, Ahnold was much better in T1 with a dozen lines than any of the dozen films with dialog that followed it).I can see where Boll has earned a reputation for being a bad director. From Rayne's escape from the carnival (Loken screaming in the wild, fade to Loken screaming in her cage, fade to her screaming in the wild, then to cage, then to moaning in the wild), to the ending scene (after all die except Rayne, she stares into the camera and the director then gives 2-second bytes from every main scene, essentially recreating the movie in 30-40 seconds, then watching her ride off to somewhere we don't know and quite frankly no longer care about), he blew every chance he had.I will recommend this movie to one person - my brother. But then, we tell each other about the best movies we've seen, and the godawful worst ones. I'll suggest he drink heavily before watching this one.",

I can't begin to tell you were this movie went all wrong. One, Rayne is being held against her own will is unbelievably out of character.Rayne's character in this film is too ridiculous. Rayne was constantly scared when she was in danger. She was upset when she had to kill her \"friend\" to get her fighting blades. One, Rayne has no friends, only friends with benefits. Two, she shows mercy to no one.Kristana Loken is a good choice, but was being taken in the wrong direction with her acting ability, oh wait she played a terminator, never mind... but she could have done a decent job by not staring in a film with a tasteless director.You can tell this man does not play the video games to comprehend what the characters need to be like, or act like in a film based of the game.This film had some unnecessary scenes in it. This film is nothing more really then a soft core porno. Hence, unnecessary sex scenes, nude scenes, etc...Yes Bloodrayne is a sex icon to many men, possibly women, but I don't recall there being sex in any of the video games, maybe some nude here and there, but not sex. None of those scenes were relevant to the storyline, AT ALL.I also might add, that on the back of the DVD/VHS cover, it mentions an \"All Star Cast\" plays in this movie. They can just take that back. An \"all star\" cast consist of -A- movie actors, I only see C & D movie actors.Yes you will recognize many of the \"actors\" in this movie, but I don't recall them being an -A- list actor.Micheal Madsen, yes, you have seen him in The Kill Bill movies, Sin City, Resivour Dogs, and others, I could buy his acting in these movies, but then again I wasn't to appeased with this movie.Michelle Rodriegez,again, Fast& The Furious, Resident Evil, and that about explains it's self(Lost doesn't count, it's TV not a movie).Matthew Davis, Blue Crush, and I hear Kate Bosworth is playing in Superman Returns as Lois Lane...I see who got the better deal out of that movie...Billy Zane, The Phantom, Titanic, Small role in Zoolander as himself, ya any who for some reason I can only remember Titanic, and Leo Dicaprio won an Academy Award...mmmmm geeez.Meatloaf Aday...nu ff said... eh Crazy in Alabama, crap that was probably his twin brother in that role...And last but not Least, Sir Ben Kingsly, WTF was he thinking staring in this movie? ya folks there was only one -A- list actor...one -A- list actor that did not have enough fire power to save this movie.And to wrap it up, this movie does not fall into the Relevant story line of the video games, Rayne Kills Kagan in the Second game in modern times, not in the middle ages...",

The Craptacular Trilogy is in the can.\" I still can't believe I wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this bile. The script was horrible. The choreography makes those old cheesy kung-fu movies look like \"Enter The Dragon\".

            "content": "I work at the Muvico theater in my city so I see all movies for free and I see everything (just about). I saw Alone In The Dark after I'd been a fan of the games for some years and realized the story made no sense and the only thing it had in connection with the game were the characters and names of certain things and places. The movie was crap. That's when I started hearing about Uwe Boll and his video-game-to-movie love. I realized this was going to get only worse. Man was I right. I've never played BloodRayne and now I never plan to. All I knew was she was a vampire (or should I say damphir whatever that crap is?) and she seemed pretty vicious from the cover and ads I'd seen in magazines. Since I'm a video game lover I walked into BloodRayne when I got off work cuz the timing was good and I knew it would be bad but I was a curious cat.I enter like 10 minutes into the movie and see Michael Madsen (who I kind of like since I saw him in Kill Bill) and some other loser wearing a mullet. Of course they're complaining about some bad guy killing off another race... Then I see Michelle Rodriguez who is dressed like someone of the present when the movie takes place in the 1800's (I think?). Then Ben Kingsley (whom I respectED) wearing a girly wig and makeup. Then Kristana Loken who looks nothing like the character I've seen in mags despite some horrible outfitting and hair color. This movie was so much crap I can't even make fun of it cuz I wouldn't know where to start. I've never seen a movie this bad, honestly. Uwe Boll should be have his blooddrayned (Haha get it?). The only thing I liked was Kristana's sex scene with the mullet man. Uwe Boll must have some serious bucks to have gotten such big stars and some nipple bearrings from Ms. Loken. So see this movie just for that scene if you must, otherwise go watch Hostel. And to believe, Mr. Boll is making 3 or 4 more video game movies... What is this world coming to?",

I wanted to bash my head against the wall for Vertical Limit, I laughed through the whole movie. I would rather watch this \"2.1\" 10 times than that \"5.5\" once.

            "content": "That's just about the only good thing I can say about BloodRayne - it makes the next movie you watch seem like an academy award winner.First of all, the whole movie sounds like a script read-through of a school play. The actors give each other ample time to read their lines, standing perfectly still as if no one knew who had the next line. And when words do come out, they sound just as natural as when you're reading something for the first time, word for word.Much of this may be attributed to the language, which by switching \"don't\" for \"do not\" and \"we have to\" for \"we must\", and giving some last minute instructions in British \"r\"s and \"a\"s, is meant to give it all a medieval sound. This may work for a stage drama, but not for a movie.Kristanna Loken and Michelle Rodriguez made a few whole-hearted attempts at bringing some life and attitude to their characters, kudos to them! Unfortunately, the unnatural lines and the lack of atmosphere actually make them stand out for the worse. The more experienced actors, Ben Kingsley and Michael Madsen, seem to tackle this project with a more than understandable dejected ambivalence, which actually works to their characters' advantage. Meat Loaf and Billy Zane were lucky enough to have so short-lived characters that they could play them all out just to spice up the story a bit, without having to look back.Now I could go on with the rotten choreography, the minor flesh wounds that spurt blood like there's no tomorrow, the \"our invincible heroin fights an army, but gets knocked on the head and is rendered helpless\"- and \"our heroes were just killed, but return to save our heroin\"-clich\u00e9s, the hopeless camera angles and -effects, but I won't. And if you want to watch this one just to see Kristanna and/or Michelle; don't. What you see is surprisingly unimpressive, and by no means good enough to justify the disappointment of seeing them fail to save this hopeless movie.Bottom line: The story is cool enough, and with a talented cast like this, it could have made for a great B movie. If it hadn't been for everything else.",

The editing was choppy, and the dialogue was so pointless, I would have had better time deciphering the gibberish from a baby's mouth. who continues to allow Uwe Boll to produce and direct movies? I am ashamed to say that I have seen this movie, as well as the other piece of crap he made 'Alone in the Dark'. All in all, that is approximately four hours of my life that I will never get back on those two stinkers. Uwe Boll isn't even in the same class of director as Ed Wood....he's worse. As for the actors, I have lost a lot of respect for both Ben Kingsley and Michelle Rodriguez, both are known for Academy Award nominated performances, both flopped in this piece of crap. Did they loose a bet, and have to pay-up by acting in this monstrosity? I will give Michelle credit at least for trying to salvage some of this endeavor of hers, she at least tried on the screen (which is more than I can say for Michael Madsen, Kristanna Loken, and Ben Kingsley). I would be reluctant to cast Kristanna in a play for an elementary school for fear of causing trauma to the children. The only thing of merit that she can claim in Bloodrayne, is her very perky breasts, and her ability to moan in a sex scene. And Michael Madsen is the equivalent of chewing on glass when he monotonously recites his lines (shoot me!). luckily I have short hair, otherwise I would have pulled it all out watching this gem from hell. We have idiots in the oval office, please don't keep idiots (Uwe Boll) in the production seat when it comes to our entertainment.....DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!",

Be warned then that I would have been egregiously wrong. It's so uninteresting I couldn't bear to watch more than half of it. The cast, while potentially one of the greatest ever, delivers a lackluster performance. The story could have been epic, but is instead more like reading the highlighted sections in a used college textbook. I've not played the video game, but I'd wager that this movie totally fails to capture even a whiff of its spirit. Indeed, this movie is without a spirit. It's a zombie.

In my opinion, leave a video game a video game and leave a movie a movie. And to this movie...the reason why this movie is probably so bad is because there was no effort in making this movie I mean...how do you make a bad movie when you try? The director probably threw this train wreck together as a way to make quick cash well if you don't try then don't expect your movie or game to get money or good reviews. Try, and your product will get glory. Overall, Bloodrayne was a terrible movie that shouldn't be watched at all. My advice: Stay away from the movie! The games were decent (from critic reviews I've heard so, after this movie I don't plan to play the games, well I don't have an interest for them) but the point is don't watch it, I did and I regretted it.

Yes all the individual criticisms at the film from the bizarre choices in hair pieces and costumes to the silly dialogue are true. But c'mon it's a video game/vampire movie. Really how high are ones expectations going in? For a video game movie it isn't half bad. (Its tons better than say Doom, not as tightly put together as say Resident Evil) Uwe brings a refreshing European sensibility to sex and violence in the movie (In other words plenty of gratuitous nudity and violence). He also makes good use of the Romanian landscape bringing an almost Peter Jackson feel to the proceedings.\r Also in campy side of things it's always fun watching Hollywood professionals ruin careers for the sake of a paycheck. (The way Madsen looks and acts in this movie I wouldn't hire him to do my lawn and Kingsley acts as if he is auditioning for the Mr. Burns role in an upcoming live action Simpson's movie) So Uwe Boll isn't the next Ed Wood more a talentless Paul Verhoeven.

On top of that, likeSaw 'Bloodrayne' and its two sequels out of curiosity to see if they were as bad as their terrible reputation. As well as seeing whether one of the worst directors of all time Uwe Boll was capable of making a good film. On top of that, like Ben Kingsley a lot as an actor and he is reason enough to see anything he's involved in. Did not have my hopes up, because even looking at the advertising and trailers 'Bloodrayne' looked awful.The terrible reputation and dubious advertising do not lie. 'Bloodrayne' to me and many others really is that bad, bad actually is an understatement. Have come to the conclusion that Boll is incapable of making a halfway decent film, have not seen everything of his but all that has been seen has been terrible and as bad as their reputation. As someone who is usually very generous rating and reviewing films, 'Bloodrayne' does stand out as one of the worst films seen recently and actually full stop. Everything is abysmally executed and there are no redeeming qualities at all, have said that about very few films seen recently.'Bloodrayne' couldn't be more inept visually. Photography that is both chaotic and static, bacon-slicer-like editing, drab costumes that don't fit the setting, continuity errors galore (more than anybody can count), afterthought-like visual effects, lighting completely lacking in atmosphere, those can all be found. The music sounds cheap and is never dynamic with anything on screen, often working against it and like it belonged in another film entirely.Writing is horrendously stilted and cheesy, enough to make one want to vomit and the unintentional camp later on becomes exhausting. The action has no momentum or excitement whatsoever, is chaotically edited, under-rehearsed choreographically and a lot of it is incomprehensible. It really takes ineptitude to a whole new level. As is the story, it never comes to life and is not easy to follow often. Boll's direction is typically non-existent and cold, comparing him to Ed Wood is rather insulting when although Wood's films were the complete opposite of fine heart one could see that he had his heart in the right place (something that has never been the case with Boll). The characters are walking cliches that are neither interesting or worth rooting for, instead bland and irritating.You know something is wrong when the best performance comes from an angry-looking Michelle Rodriguez. Elsewhere there is an emotionless lead, Meat Loaf's uncomfortable cameo and Michael Madsen and Billy Zane going through the motions. Worst of it is Kingsley in his worst ever performance, taking hamminess and chewing-scenery-to-pieces to mind-boggling extremes.Summarising, completely bloodless and appallingly awful. 1/10 Bethany Cox",
