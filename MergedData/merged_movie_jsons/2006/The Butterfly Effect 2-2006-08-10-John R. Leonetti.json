Just wanted to see how they would update the interesting concept of the first movie. Well, Eric Lively is certainly no Ashton.Erica Durance, while beautiful, did not have much to show in terms of acting. The beginning was very slow. The first part where their relationship was established in a very prolonged manner. However, once the \"butterfly effect\" scenes were underway, the midportion was actually very interesting. It is just too bad that it led to a very illogical and unsatisfying ending. Certainly could have been better.",

This movie, to put it bluntly is terrible when compared to the first. The plot is nonsensical, and takes place around a boring office environment. The acting is frigid, there is little character development, and predictably leads the viewer to little enjoyment, and lots of confusion.It would appear the director of this film has not even seen the first one, considering the frequent mistakes, and plot jumps.Save your money, skip this one. This possessed such great potential, but suffered such terribly delivery",

Plus seeing the main character in their childhood sorta made you connect more with the character. Here you learn nothing about the bland main characters whatsoever. Erica Durance does give a good performance, but then she always does but that doesn't diminish the fact that the way the script is written we learn nothing about the main characters. It isn't even \"The Butterfly Effect\" its just had a few elements of it thrown in there. Take that away and you've got a bland corporate thriller with nothing worth watching at all.",

This time around, the unfortunate sap who alters history to his detriment is young businessman Nick Larson (Eric Lively): after inadvertently twisting time to prevent the death of his girlfriend Julie (Smallville hottie Erica Durance), Nick tries to use his new found ability to change his life for the better, but only ends up making matters much worse.As the Final Destination series has proved, the same premise can be used time and time again and still result in a hugely entertaining film. Unfortunately, Butterfly Effect 2 doesn't manage to pull off the same trick, failing to emulate the dark tone of the original, Nick's unsuccessful attempts to climb the corporate ladder hardly making for gripping viewing. And with the central character becoming less and less likable with each new time-line, the film actually makes one long for the involvement of Ashton Kutcher (did I really just type that?).",

            "content": "Many people thought the original film was brilliant, myself included. It did well at the box-office. Why, oh why did the studio decide to throw its IP straight down the drain? The franchise is the life-blood of Hollywood. The wilful trashing of a franchise is the worst possible sin.Anyway, this new movie is a nightmare. A hack writer and a hack director simply attempt to remake the first movie, without a clue as to what made the movie tick in the first place.So, in BE2, a young dude will do anything for the love of his girl. And has the power to change his own history, suffering the usual \"monkey's paw\" curse. We even have a copy of the undesired male-male sex scene.The young dude even has the same concerned Mom, and the same 'troubled' Dad as in the first one.Where the plot deviates, it does so by stripping out 90% of the original film's intricate plotting, leaving us with a crudely constructed parody.BE2 adds NOTHING to the mythology, and is devoid of any good action sequences. Even as straight-to-DVD, it stinks. Please, if you like the original, forget this trash. If you need another dose of the story, watch the original with the alternate ending.To the producers, let me say \"why?\". A decent script, a hungry young director, and a budget little different from this film would have given you 50 million dollars plus at the US box-office alone. Do you really have so much money that you are happy to throw it down the drain like this. It is a pity that YOUR investors were not as ruthless as the ones portrayed in your film. This might have given you the incentive to put some effort into your job.",

This IMHO is a quite poor money making rip from the first. It follows the same plot line from the first based on time warps looking at past events but really lacks any real surprises and is kind of guessable. You pretty much need to see the first one to understand the workings behind this one completely but if you have seen the first one and found it amazing (almost donnie darko (ish)) then you will find this a very mediocre follow up. if you've not seen either i HIGHLY suggest you miss this one and watch the first. possibly stop there and don't bother watching this, it will only disappoint if you were stunned by the first. definitely not an improvement I'm sad to say after thinking the first was fantastic. Pity as i was hoping of soooo much from this film",

But if you don't want to read ANY spoilers at all you were warned.Why, why, why!!!??? Why do people still make this horrible movies. I loved the first one, and I had little expectations for this one, I thought \"OK, surprise me\", but at the end of the movie I realized I lost around 90 or 100 minutes of my life (a blackout here would have been great for me)The movie: 1) Forget the concept of blackouts, there are no blackouts here, the main character simply concentrates in a picture, everything shakes around him (a dumb visual effect) and he just travels in time. That's it. Voila! 2) The story is very poor, confusing and extremely boring. 3) The characters are not even interesting. 4) Acting: Well, let's give them some credit, they did what they could... 5) The love history: A very common one. Does not add anything to the movie, it's not even romantic (like in the original where he always tries to save her) 6) Whoever wrote the story does not seem to have seen \"the butterfly effect\". Instead, looks like he read a review of the movie and wrote the script based on that.Finally, spite of my comments and the rest of the comments you might still want to watch the movie. I mean, it's the sequel of \"the butterfly effect\", right? you might think \"well, it can't be that bad!\" But believe me, if you liked the first one, you'll hate this one. Tnx for reading :-)",

While in the road, Nick has an accident and Julie and his friends die. One year later, Nick finds that he can travel in time and tries to fix the past, with tragic consequences for the future.\"Butterfly Effect 2\" is a very unpleasant movie, with a terrible and flawed screenplay. The best things in this film are the accident on the road, and the gorgeous Erica Durance, from \"Smallville\". The story really does not work and seeing this film is pure waste of time, and in the end it is better off watching the original \"Butterfly Effect\" again. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): \"Efeito Borboleta 2\" (\"Butterfly Effect 2\")",

The main character's abilities were explained in a sort of way that it was slightly believable and the movie was full of twists and turns that culminated in a satisfying and realistic ending. Sadly the sequel does not feature any of the elements that made the original so brilliant. Everything has been dumbed down , gaps in the storyline are almost insulting if you're a fan of the previous film and the amount of sex infused in this movie is unjustified for this storyline , it isn't placed to create an atmosphere like in Lord of War per say , it just seems thrown in because the director was clueless. There are no moment when your skin tingles , you are spoon fed the entire story , everything is very linear in a movie where the time-lines are supposed to be altered and the ending made me feel i needed a drink. Just watch the first movie again or search for something else , this movie is one step away from being one of Uwe Boll's, a definite pass.",

I expected that the second Butterfly effect movie would continue on this highly enjoyable path. I found it strange and puzzling that Butterfly effect 2 did not make it onto the big screen , but was send strait onto DVD instead?. After I saw the movie, I had to conclude that Butterfly effect 2 is not even a shadow of the original Butterfly effect movie. The story is a lame, predictable love story without suspense or thrill. Now I can understand why the second movie was demoted directly onto a DVD. The first Butterfly effect movie was a trilling , suspenseful wild water ride compared to this stagnant pool of muck....",

            "content": "The reason why the first movie was very good (I would call it even brilliant) was, that for first half an hour, you didn't know what's going on here. You saw Kutcher's childhood which was from time to time affected by blackouts and you didn't know what they are for there. As this is a sequel, the tension was missing and the guy even didn't have blackouts at all. Many times during the new movie I felt like watching the first movie and that the new one just changed a few things. For example, compare the prison scene and the scene on toilets. This movie lacks strong scenes, which are replaced by sex. Again, remember the first movie - burning of a dog, dynamite in a box, visit at Lenny's room in hospital etc. Those moments were breathtaking, quick and strong. What do you have in the second one? A lot of people hate the ending of this movie, but well...how would you end it? It would be a disgrace if it was pure happy-end and also, they couldn't do partial happy-end, if they didn't want to repeat themselves again. All in all, this flick is very mediocre and the comparing to the original movie pushes it even lower. I won't say \"AVOID IT!\", watch it on some evening when you want to watch TV but the only thing they broadcast is Big Brother.",

I thought sleeping would be a better use of my weekend time.And the special effects were terrible. The director couldn't even reproduce the original effect where Ashton went into his past. This time, the effect looks cheap, the sound effects are awful and all it does is ruin the great perception I had about the first movie.Honestly, John R. Leonetti should stick to cinematography. He just doesn't quite cut it as a director, I think he knows that after seeing his terrible film.Mr. Bress and Mr. Gruber should be very angry with the fact that he ruined their concept. Actually, they should sue him and the company that had the guts to destroy a great story, and a great film.I hope the audience realizes this, and help The Butterfly Effect 2 become the greatest failure in movie history, for it deserves it.",

            "content": "Funny how movie prices have gone down. I recently bought the DVD for $5 which has both movies on a single disk, 'Effect' and 'Effect 2'. I had seen the first one but not the second. The only similarity is the ability of the protagonist to reverse time and 'correct' an unfavorable issue, which then causes a number of different outcomes, and some of them not very desirable at all.I recently have become a fan of Erica Durance in her role as Lois Lane in the 'Smallville' TV series. This movie, 'Effect 2', was my first chance to see her in a different role, and she is good.Eric Lively is Nick Larson and his 24-year-old girlfriend is Erica Durance as Julie Miller. Nick and Julie are in love but things happen to threaten all that. Nick by accident, while looking at a photo, finds out he can reverse time and change things.Not a great movie, but a nice story which can have some lessons for the discerning viewer. Also fairly entertaining. Better than its IMDb rating would indicate.SPOILERS FOLLOW: Nick, Julie, and friends are having a nice weekend at a mountain lake when Nick gets a call that he has to go back to the office. Relucantly he goes, but on the way through the mountains, with a front wheel blowout, they wreck with a large truck, Julie dies. It is about a year later when Nick manages to turn back time, to right before they left the lake that day. This time, knowing about the truck, he manages to avoid it and Julie lives. But back at work other things arise, Nick does something to get himself a promotion that had gone to someone else, but this created other problems. Nick became a different person, he had apparently rejected Julie. In the very last time he goes back in time to the lake he tells Julie to go to NY to pursue her art, she tells him she is pregnant. Distraught Julie gets in the car, Nick follows her, manages to save her, but he went off the cliff in the second car and dies. He sacrificed himself for her, in a 'Casablanca' moment. The movie ends with Julie in her NY apartment with her young son.",

The story was not interesting and it added nothing new to the genre.The movie is nothing more than an attempt to make a few quick bucks by using the name of the the original movie.I have seen comments that it is hard to follow which I disagree with completely. I found it easy to follow but incredibly boring. It simply follows the path of a guy who can look at pictures and change the past. Each time he changes the past, it turns out be worse than it was before. That is the whole movie.If you like the genre, I recommend renting Donnie Darko or watching the original Buttetfly Effect.

It's like they couldn't afford enough film in order to make it at least 105-115 minutes long... the action is accelerated, some parts can not be understood (due to lack of time alloted to do so). the script has (had) potential but... Overall it was less thrilling compared to the 2004 film (Ashton Kutcher was brilliant in that one), and the ending is less like you want it to be.

With Julie & his two friends dead Nick is devastated as the only survivor, while experiencing headaches Nick looks at a picture of himself & Julie & manages to travel back in time to that point & is able to change the past. Right away Nick decides to go back to the day of the crash & manages to alter history & save Julie & his friends but Nick soon becomes obsessed with going back in time & trying to change things to make a perfect future for himself & Julie but each time he does go back his future gets worse & worse...Directed by John R. Leonetti this was a straight-to-video sequel for the sci-fi drama The Butterfly Effect (2004) & is just about inferior to the original in every respect. While I liked the original The Butterfly Effect I didn't love it, I thought it was an above average well written sci-fi drama while The Butterfly Effect 2 is a below average badly written sci-fi drama. In all honestly beside the title this has little connection to the original anyway, there are no black-outs in this, the main character Nick travels back in time by looking at pictures rather than reading journals & apart from the first time he travels back to save his friends lives most of what he does seems very selfish, the emotion you felt for the character's in the original certainly isn't here with a picture book perfect collection of young men & women. Also I didn't think all of Nick's decisions made sense, I mean if you go back to stop getting hit by a huge truck because of a tyre blow out why didn't he just stop the car & pull over until the huge truck had gone by? Instead he just tells Julie to put a seat belt on. Then there's the ending which is basically the same as the original but if that phone-call from work started the whole chain why does he just not answer the call? Also the car coming towards him at the end is seen from a great distance & sure either Nick or the other driver would have stopped or something rather than just heading straight for each other. There are just to many scenes here where you will not understand character's motives or simply think they are plain stupid. Too much of the film is spent on Nick trying to forge a perfect future & trying to get a top job where he works which is just quite dull really & the film isn't as dark in tone as the original either. Once again no explanation is given as to why Nick can time travel & it's more of an issue here than the original since the plot & character's are weaker here.At 90 odd minutes The Butterfly Effect 2 isn't a particularly long film but it does feel that way as it does tend to drag. The Butterfly Effect 2 never pushed the original concept any further & in fact probably pushes it further into the background in order for it to become a convenient way to go back in time that has no real reason or explanation behind it. There's no real blood or gore but a man does have his face smashed through a glass table & there are a couple of sex scenes including one where Nick wakes up to find someone under the sheets is sucking him off & finds out that it's some gay gangster, that would just screw me up for life man. Now getting a blow job from a bloke is something I definitely would want to go back & time & stop happening if you know what I mean.Filmed in British Columbie in Canada this has good production values but does tend to look like the straight-to-video shelf filler it so obviously is at times. The acting is alright but the cast just look too perfect & no-one stands out as being particularly good. The only significant connection The Butterfly Effect 2 has to the original is one picture printed in a newspaper of Jason Treborn who was Evan's father in The Butterfly Effect.The Butterfly Effect 2 is a dull sequel that tells the same sort of story as the first but is even vaguer & has even less rules regarding the time travel aspect which doesn't help & a lack of any real involvement with the character's or interesting time alterations means this is instantly forgettable fare.",

As long as you know what \"The Butterfly Effect\" is then you will have a basic understanding of what is going on in part 2 of the movie. Part 2 is a separate film so you will still have to watch it to know what happens because it is not a copy of nor a remake of The Butterfly Effect (2004).I think the IMDb rating on The Butterfly Effect 2 is a bit underrated but not as good as the first film.7.5/10",

Having nothing at all to do with the Ashton Kutcher vehicle, this in name only sequel isn't nearly as edgy or dark. In fact the movie is tame, lifeless, and void of any real reason to watch it at all. Competently directed, but horribly written and full of glaring plot-holes. But for Michael Weiss (I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer, Death Train, Octopus) that's par for the course. If you told me a few days back that I'd wish for anything with Kutcher in it, I'd have called you crazy. However, that's exactly what I long for. Stick with the original film and skip this pathetic attempt to quickly cash in on the name.My Grade: D DVD Extras: Audio commentary by Director John Leonetti & co-producer Micheal Stirling; 'on the set of' featurette; Promo trailer; and Trailers for \"Butterfly Effect\", \"Snakes on a Plane\", \"Undisputed 2\", \"Take the Lead\", \"Nightmare on Elm Street\", \"Rest Stop\", & \"Nightmares & Dreamscapes\"",

            "content": "This movie is the sequel to another, released two years earlier. I confess I liked the first movie, I think it exceeded the few expectations I had for it. But what should I do when, upon seeing this movie, I felt I had a poor version of the first movie in hand?In fact, the similarities between both films are too many. The script is basically a copy of the first movie where only the character names are changed, as well as some minor details, such as the fact that the main character goes back to the past through photographs and not, as in the first movie, by reading old diaries. To make matters worse, the characters are terrible and lack the ability to hold the audience, as I felt in the first movie. In the first movie it was still possible to be interested in understanding how it was going to end, and still felt a certain empathy for the characters. Not here... in this movie, it doesn't matter if they live or die or stay together or apart.Eric Lively gave life to the main character, but it was a fiasco. I don't know if it was the actor's fault, or the bad script, or John Leonetti's bad direction. The fact is that everything went wrong and the actor did a bad job, especially from the middle, in which his character essentially becomes a scornful idiot. Erica Durance is too sugary and artificial, and the remaining cast is better said no more.This movie, being a sad and poorly made copy of the first one, bet more on the box office than on the quality of what it presents. It does not deserve to be seen, and I doubt if it should have been done.",

One main problem with the whole concept is that he bounces back and forth skipping some critical parts of his history. Since there are an infinite number of alternate realities, If you let him try hard enough he can find the right combination. This version flowed very easily from one life scenario to another, too easy in some cases. Top notch film technically and the acting is pretty good. Fairly entertaining.",

What human being would say that.I liked part 1, so when I saw there was a sequel, even knowing it had a very low rating, I wanted to give it chance. I love time travel movies, so if this was ANYTHING like the first one, at a minimum I figured I would get a moderate amount of enjoyment out of it.All I got was a moderate amount of homicidal thoughts after this. I can't believe that professionals can actually create something so bad. Put aside the bland acting and the boring writing for a second, and look at the way the script was structured. The movie was a little less than 90 minutes long, yet nothing even happens for the first 52 minutes, when the movie's more than half over. There was no development of story or characters whatsoever. A complete waste of 52 minutes of screen time.Whoever wrote this did the equivalent of building a roller coaster that travels from one side of the park to the other without EVER GOING UP, and instead travels across in a completely straight line, and so as you exit off the coaster, you're wondering \"wtf was that??\" The writer of this story forgot to add the one key element that makes all stories work on some level: some conflict for a protagonist to overcome, obviously. Nothing resembling drama or suspense took place until either the 52 minute mark, or the 61 minute mark. It all depends on whether you would consider his confrontation with his friend in the garage at the 52 minute mark as something significant that builds the story and moves it forward. If not, then there's definitely NOTHING that happens until the 61 minute mark, which is when he realizes that he's no longer in a relationship with his girlfriend. Now that's actually pretty interesting. But why are we JUST NOW getting into the realm of \"he has to fix this disastrous timeline he's now in, one without his girlfriend,\" with only less than a HALF HOUR of the movie left? What the hell did we watch for the past hour? Everything that happened before was completely inconsequential, you might as well start watching this movie from the 52 or 61 minute mark, you won't miss a thing.",

The second one has the same concept, just a different cast. I was expecting a horrible movie after all the bad reviews on this film, not to mention the low rating. But I actually enjoyed the second Butterfly Effect.This time we have a boyfriend, Nick and his girlfriend, Julie, their friends and they are on a trip. Nick gets called into work again, driving everyone back and gets into a fatal car accident killing his friends and his girlfriend. A year has passed and Nick's still having bad dreams and headaches, but when he gets his hands on a picture they took that day of the accident, he goes back in time and prevents the accident from ever happening. Things are actually looking up for him, Julie's back and their relationship is stronger than ever, but he can't except the fact that he didn't get promoted at work, so he goes back again. But he ends up making things worse for his relationship and friendships.The Butterfly Effect 2, even though it's not Oscar material, I felt that it was a decent film, a lot better than most that I've seen. I think people just need to give it a chance, because I didn't really see any problems that wouldn't put this film in the 5 or 6.0's on the rating system.

Instead, Vol 2 uses the same notion - that of a character flashing back in time to change a single event, with the consequences of that change rippling forward into the future - and gives us a completely different story with completely different characters.This time around a puncture sees software salesman Nick lose his girlfriend, his best friend Trevor and Trevor's fianc\u00e9e in a car accident. A year later he is able to effect the first return to change things, generating an alternate course of events which starts out well but then goes sour. These changes come about via photographs (it was the protagonist's diary in the first movie).As with the first one, I love alternate possibility stories. The trouble here is that the alternates simply aren't that interesting. Far too much centres around the work rivalry between Nick and rival Bristol and, frankly, they were both as bad as each other and I didn't care which one came out on top. Eric Lively, contrary to his name, is an insipid lead, Dustin Milligan's Trevor is an irritating and unsympathetic second fiddle and, for a film which runs a short 88 minutes, it is so leisurely in going about its business that, at times, I felt like shouting \"Get on with it!\" The ending wasn't bad, though, and Erica Durance always pleases.",

Had our hero had the common sense simply to go back to that first group photo and then not answer the phone call from work that triggered the sequence of events that leads him to despair in a variety of (largely unimaginative) ways, he would have saved both himself and us a lot of pain. But then this guy doesn't even realise he's morphed into a bachelor when he discovers a pool table in his penthouse flat. I mean, come on, how stupid is that? I've seen the first film but can't really remember that much about it any more, although I do recall that, while deeply flawed, it was entertaining enough. It wasn't good enough to merit a sequel, but obviously put enough bucks in the box to convince some producer to have another go. What we basically get is the same story without the increasing illness but still with the nose bleeds. It's lazy film-making of the most obvious kind, created for only one purpose.",

Oh boy was I wrong.The movie follows a new character who seems in no way connected to Evan Treborn, (which isn't a bad thing I guess) In the movie He and his girlfriend and 2 other friends were in a car accident and of course one year later he tries to go back and change everything and screws it up.

This movie was not even worth picking up for free.QUOTE IMDb: The entire film was shot in 20 days.Let me tell you. it shows.

But I think the biggest problem with this movie is that for the most part it feels \"soft\". For the majority of the running time, you never feel the hero is in a situation that is over his head. He takes most of his new predicaments surprisingly casually. Since he doesn't seem to be all that bothered, it's hard to care about him or his loved ones.

This one has a teeny bit more maturity and a little less teeny-bopper sensibility thanks to there being no Ashton K involved, but the lead here seems to be a pretty boy model type, and comes off pretty much in love with himself. No surprise that there's a gay scene that ends up being handled in a bad way. As in the first one, the lead who is able to travel to his past makes all the wrong decisions, and the ones that nobody watching would have made. It is really annoying that he doesn't get a memory update when he changes the past, a departure from the first film. And somehow the baby get a bit of a time-wobble effect from looking at a photo from his Dad's life. I guess that can be explained by the fact that the baby was already conceived and was in the photo as a fetus. Yes, anything in any film can be explained in any way, shape and form by that great logic of filmdom known as science (fiction). Oh, if you watch this with others, try to make a game out of who can catch the most product placement commercials.

I really thought the opening was well done. It starts off showing us the love between Julie and Nick, a very heartfelt and emotional segment, and then the tragic accident. For a DTV sequel I thought it was extremely well made, with above average acting for the production it had. You're able to care for Julie and Nick. Nick is a little cocky, but he has a good heart, and the fact that he clearly loves Julie, you're able to root for him. I thought it had a fitting ending too. The only problem I really had with this was, it lagged a bit in the middle sometimes.Performances. Eric Lively does very well as Nick. As I said he's arrogant, but in a likable way, and I truly believed in his love for Julie. Erica Durance is very pretty, and makes for a likable heroine. Her chemistry with Lively was great, and she made for a likable character.Bottom line. I enjoyed this much more then I should have probably.

            "content": "\"The Butterfly Effect 2\" (2006)Directed By: John R. LeonettiStarring: Eric Lively, Erica Durance, Dustin Milligan, & Gina HoldenMPAA Rating: \"R\" (for violence, sexuality and language)I know that I might be in the minority when I say this, but I never enjoyed \"The Butterfly Effect\". I found it to be a drab, depressing movie that, despite excellent performances and an intriguing concept, ultimately did not click somewhere. So, I didn't particularly care to see this straight-to-video sequel. If I didn't even care for the movie that actually made it to theaters, why would I care for the one that didn't? But, deciding to do my job (and deciding that seeing Erica Durance is always worth my time), I chose to give it a chance. So, what did I think about it? Well, I had very profound mixed feelings: The Good: The movie actually surpasses its predecessor. The performances are well done and believable. Erica Durance has plenty of screen time. The movie is actually fun to watch. Erica Durance has plenty of screen time (Oh wait\u0085). The Bad: The amazing concept is not used to its full extent\u0085yet again. The ending is abrupt, tacked-on, and completely uninspired. It's an unnecessary sequel to an unnecessary film. The initial love relationship that propels the plot is a little cheesy and forced. Did I mention how bad the ending was?Nick Larson (Lively) has everything he could ever want: a beautiful girlfriend, Julie (Durance), and a job that is going nowhere but up\u0085until a tragic car accident leaves Julie and their two best friends dead. Afterwards, Nick realizes that, through his memories, he can travel back in time and does in order to save his friends, especially Julie. But, when he does, he messes everything else up. As he races to make things right again, he discovers that you can't change one thing\u0085without changing everything. Where have I heard this plot before? Oh wait, it was the exact same plot used in \"The Butterfly Effect\"! This sequel is really more of a remake, but, naturally, as \"The Butterfly Effect\" is so recent, a sequel makes more sense. Really, who wants to see a remake of a movie that was released only two years ago? Well, if you desire to watch \"The Butterfly Effect 2\", then you clearly do. Don't let the \"2\" tagged on at the end of the title fool you. This is a remake.\"The Butterfly Effect 2\" is a mixed bag. On one hand, it actually beat its predecessor for me due to the lack of the depressing, overly-serious plot twists that just didn't seem to click. This movie is far more entertaining and a far lighter watch than the original\u0085and that is a good thing. The performances, especially those from Eric Lively and Erica Durance, are well-rounded, competent performances that are too good for a straight-to-video release. On the other hand, the ending leaves way too much to be desired. It didn't work for me and it didn't gel. It also, like the original, became a tad redundant. We knew that, every time he changed something, it would not work out well for him and something would go horribly wrong. Overall, this is a movie that worked somewhat\u0085but not completely. If you hated the original, then you may find this to be better, but, if you were a fan, then you will probably find this to be a little too light for your enjoyment. It didn't take itself as seriously and some of you may not like this. I did.Final Thought: Though better than the original for me, \"The Butterfly Effect 2\" is still only semi-effective.Overall Rating: 5/10 (B-)",

Clearly rushed into production to capitalize on the first film's success, there are probably plenty of moments that you can pick apart if you are so inclined (like when Eric Lively goes back in time for the first time and he knows that a car accident is about to happen but instead of pulling over his car immediately he merely orders Erica Durance to put on her seatbelt!), but in general it goes through its paces in a competent fashion. It even has the downbeat ending to match the \"director's cut\" version of the original, although it obviously doesn't have the same impact here. Still, the current 4.4 IMDb rating is too low; this is not even the worst movie sequel of its year! (Basic Instinct 2, anyone?) **1/2 of 4 stars.",

Like is the case with Terminator 2. And isn't with this. This is 32 minutes shorter, and yes that does mean there's significantly less depth. I'm not saying that this one did have to also show the childhood and teenage years. Only that it fails to replace it with something compelling. And the scope is smaller, with a lot of this being over one year not decades.All of the plentiful changes of the past in the first felt important, there was weight to it, because Evan was saving lives, preventing people from being miserable. Here, way too much of what little there is, boils down to simply the lead trying to make more money. I get that motivation. And the fact that he is unlikeable would be fine if he was just interesting, not bland, like most characters in this. However, it doesn't make for interesting viewing.This features some strong language and sexual material. I recommend this only to people who feel compelled to watch this after loving the far superior original. 5/10.",

Yet I am worrying about the sexuality scenes in the first film.Because I am already fed up with the second one. Does anybody find it any a bit fun to see the main character kissing over those girls in the BE2? I don't think so. It's simply overdone. In the movie, there actually is an implied clue about Nick's super power, or the ability to return to the past in a photo. When he searched it on the internet, He eventually found out about this is a symptom of paranoid people. From here I was expecting to see some thrilling idea like the one I have seen in the Identity. However it turned me down. Nick is not a crazy person but only a big loser,in my opinion. I don't know why I gave it a 6. Maybe it's because some of the tricks in the movie were very deliberately done, and believe me, that's also the only reason you can keep yourself awake when seeing it.",

The first time Eric Lively's character changed the past was really worth it. He saved the lives of his pregnant girlfriend and two friends. But then, when he discovered his powers, he used them to fix everything that wasn't perfect, and, of course it went from bad to worse. After he made Julie and Trevor die again, he went back all away to the beginning of the film and sacrificed himself for Julie. So, he died in a car crash, allowing Trevor and Amanda to stay as they are and Julie to raise their son, who possibly inherited some of his father's abilities. The movie has some horror elements, but it's actually a psychological drama/thriller, in some ways similar to Donnie Darko (Although Drako is better). Acting performances are superb, especially Erica Durance, who plays Julie, Gina Holden, who plays Amanda, David Lewis, who plays Dave and Chris Gauthier.

The tone of the director is half TV crime story half soap opera, looks a little unfit for the subject, but then the hand of the director is sure, there are no real blunders, and we end by caring a little bit about the characters by the end.

Anyway, this sequel is an offense to its name and I hope there would be another worthy film to see. Well, let's be more specific. I agree that sex scenes were not necessary(as some guys mentioned) but i feel that if the scenario was developed more, child reference wouldn't be needed.I liked the point where Nick is searching for information about his \"illness\" and he finds a picture of a BE1 character(I think Evan's father).I think it would be interesting to see such references to the original Butterfly effect in a possible new one.",

I was bored within the first few minutes, as they laboriously hammered out a rather dull background scenario with no real characterisation. Even illicit sex scenes had me looking at my watch, as they were utterly devoid of excitement.Secondly, the acting was at best mediocre. I couldn't really care less about any of the characters here, and there is no real acting or characterisation to show the love or friendship between the main characters. Compare that to Ashton Kutcher's speech to his girlfriend to show that he loves her and knows her, when just having had sex is not enough proof. This comparison shows just how far this paltry effort falls short.\"I'd do anything for you guys!\" How about not making awful films?**SPOILER** someone wakes up to find someone sucking him off, only to realise it is not his girlfriend, but a man. He barely shows any surprise.**END OF SPOILER*** Third - lack of imagination. The first film showed lots of different permutations that could happen in your life, and is quite imaginative in finding different avenues you could go down - some of them being downright brutal, but in terms of ideas, not in terms of visual gore. Truly inspired.

I was reminded of why I started following it to begin with. Where the original story had layers, depth and logic - a three-dimensional experience which seemed to be written by a real author, this sequel was flat, linear, almost insulting.

Unfortunately sometimes it doesn't fit together right and it's not because of the original plot or idea or in this case even the cast but rather a very, very poor job of writing. Screenwriter Michael D. Weiss so far has done nothing but straight to video sequels and B-Movie horror flicks so this is where his talent lies and in more talented hands The Butterfly Effect 2 might have made some sense and been at least worth while to see. As I sat through it I began wondering why people hated it so much, I mean the cast was actually decent, the story was flowing nicely but there wasn't a lot of explanation being given but I held out in hopes that the end would bring it all together sort of like the first installment did (although it's been years since I saw it.) Unfortunately nothing ever comes together, nothing is resolved, nothing is explained and the glaring plot holes and ridiculous ending drags this film into the mud. But I have to give it some points for being watchable up till the last half hour give or take.Eric Lively is Nick Larson. Lively is pretty good considering the script he is given and the horrendous special effects that sometimes make him look a little cheesy but overall his performance is actually very good and very watchable. I'd really like to see him do something of substance in the future. The lovely Miss Erica Durance, one of my personal favorites having portrayed Lois Lane on one of my favorite shows for some time and she's done a great job but she has a knack for picking really bad off season films. Durance is really good as the love of Nick Larson's life Julie Miller. She's so good that you practically fall in love with this sweet, innocent, artistic woman that loves him back. She really does a terrific job in the role and I think, much like Lively, she could do well with a real script. Dustin Milligan is particularly good in his small role as Nick's best friend who seems to continually get screwed as Nick plays with the past. Milligan shows a lot of emotion and is really good in his role. Gina Holden, and David Lewis are also amongst the supporting cast but never really do anything that stands out.Even completely leaving behind the original Butterfly Effect (which was pretty wildly confusing) this film could have stood on it's own two feet given the right circumstances but there was just so much left to chance and it was ridiculous?? One of the biggest problems I had was obviously Julie was going to tell Nick that she was pregnant, we as the audience discover this almost immediately, but she doesn't get to tell him before the accident. This is all fine except that in the alternate future where Nick avoids the accident...no baby...not even a year later...it's like because Nick doesn't know it, it doesn't exist well that doesn't make sense does it?? This imaginary baby doesn't even make an appearance or a mention until the very end of the film. And someone please TELL ME HOW Nick driving off that cliff saved everyone and prevented the accident?? This might be hands down the most ridiculous plot ending in the history of films? I literally sat up and said 'WHAT?' A decent cast with a potentially decent story is completely lost by what can only be described as one of the worst scripts in Hollywood. You can watch it but it won't leave you even close to fulfilled. 4/10",

If i wanted to go watch a movie. honestly i don't know what else to say about this movie i am just filling up the minimum amount of lines here. it just was amazing to me to know that such a really great movie like butterfly effect can be destroyed with one swoop on a sequel.",

In this case, the lead character Nick (Eric Lively) take his girlfriend Julie, and their two best friends, Trevor & Amanda out camping, where upon their return home, they are crushed to death by a big rig, after Nick loses control of his car. Nick survives but is plagued by migraine-like seizures that induce in him fantasies starring his friends, during which he's promoted to Vice President at his place of employment, rather than being fired for his incompetence. Subplots get less and less tangible, as his fantasies turn to nightmares, and Nick experiences his deceased friends' deaths repeatedly and from various invented causes.So basically I was disappointed with this offering, don't go out and buy it if your expecting it to be anything like the original movie, because its not.",

However, Nick is called by his colleague Dave Bristol, who is disputing the promotion with Nick, for a meeting with a client. While in the road, Nick has an accident and Julie and his friends die. One year later, Nick finds that he can travel in time and tries to fix the past, with tragic consequences for the future.I loved the first movie a lot. Now, after watching the second (which I wasn't excited about), I wished I can go back in time and NOT watch it. Why? Well, let's start off that this film adds nothing to the message in the second movie. It's just the same thing with a different cast and a less budget.If you want to see a repeat of the first film, watch the first film again. This is not worth seeing. The first has a more unique and more complex timeline than this film (which is just a span of one year). What I also don't like about this film is that the main character is just mean. You won't care what happens to him.There's no point in seeing this film. But if you just have to, watch it. Otherwise, skip this at all cost (even though I don't sound like I thought it was decent).",

Butterfly Effect is a great science fiction that jumps into the world of alternate realities and I was very nervous when I first heard about this sequel. I was fortunate enough to catch one of those marketing screenings studios often have and I have to say that I was very impressed. While I wish the movie was going to be released in theaters, this way is good too because I can just buy it on DVD and watch it whenever I want. The film explores the jumping of realities a lot more then the original, and the situations and reasons why the main character needs to go back and change things are more interesting. Also, I've only known Erica Durance from Smallville, but she was fantastic in this role (not to mention extremely attractive). Anyway, I've seen a post or two about people that have already seen it in some foreign country, and I'm not sure how that was even possible. If they did see it, I'm guessing they saw some terrible bootleg version. When the movie comes out I highly recommend you pick it up.",

There was not much of shocks like in the first film especially when Aston Kuscher lost his arms.The acting is appalling from all involved. There is no chemistry between the lead and his girlfriend.

            "content": "To be treated rather separately from its Ashton Kutcher-starring predecessor of 2 years earlier, John Leonetti's \"Butterfly Effect 2\" differs from \"1\" in dispensing with the extremely dark and drastic storylines that more or less compelled Kutcher playing Evan Treborn to make use of his inherited powers to revisit and reshape his past.This time it is Eric Lively's \"Nick\" who has basically the same power, but in this shortish film he gets to use it surprisingly few times, though we again are clear that it \"takes a lot out of him\" each time he does. Given that one (or actually more) of these reworkings inevitably revolves around saving the life of a loved one, the stakes are still pretty high (and the hero's joy at his success in \"bringing Julie back\" IS done touchingly well); but it's not like in \"1\", and in some ways that's actually a relief. At least one of the returns to the past via a photo also relates to less life-and-death matters, being rather a matter of career success, and here we have further moments of interest, as it becomes clear what is lost just as financial status is on a higher plane in this particular version of Nick's life. It's not extremely compelling but is a little thought-provoking. Frankly, the film also seeks to outdo its predecessor in being more sexy and risky in various ways, at various moments; but really it seems to do that a little out of desperation. Seeing Lindsay Maxwell as the boss's daughter hungry enough for Nick is not unalluring, though needless shoving in elsewhere of a plot strand involving drugs seems crass.Most surprisingly, \"BE2\" cuts to the chase by having its hero - unreasonably obsessed as he is with one or two points in his past (given the presumable possibility of choosing many others to revisit) - deciding to make a sacrifice for Erica Durance as love of his life Julie. It goes wrong anyway, but even had it not there seems no obvious reason why he should choose to go so far on the basis of some kind of moment of self-loathing. Surely he would have been more content to rejig the situation again, perhaps even at some quite separate point in history, allowing the timeline to go its own sweet way and never again entail the dangerous moment that is made to seem so central to this film?It is such lack of obvious cohesion that contrasts this film with its predecessor, though it can reasonably be argued that \"1\" did take a hammer to crack a nut, as it were. There is no danger of that with \"2\", but there is also not much danger of this movie being a \"life-changing experience\" for those who watch it either.",

The filmography and acting is decent as well as a rather good storyline. I must warn you however that it is acutely similar to the first. The ideas and concepts are identical.

The best example of this is the thousands of direct-to-DVD sequels that litter the walls of movie rental stores across the country. Most are pale reflections of the originals. Every once in a while a sequel comes along that doesn't improve on the first one, but still manages to entertain. \"The Butterfly Effect 2\" falls into this category. It's both entertaining and thought-provoking at the same time. I saw \"The Butterfly Effect\" when it hit DVD a few years ago and liked it. I never got around to seeing the sequel but remained mildly interested in checking it out because it starred Erica Durance from \"Smallville.\" I'm glad I had the opportunity to see it.Nick, his girlfriend Julie, and their two best friends are struck by a semi on the way home from vacation. Everyone is killed but Nick, leaving him alone to deal with the aftermath of the tragedy. He discovers he has the power to travel to the past and change events in his life. Nick starts to alter reality and finds that each jump back in time isn't necessarily changing things for the better\u0085 in the present or the future. You can tell director John R. Leonetti put his blood, sweat, and tears into this movie but was limited as to what he could do because of the budget. It doesn't feel like a straight-to-DVD movie besides some of the camera-work. The wreck looks realistic and most of the time-warp scenes look decent. The special effects aren't perfect by any means but get the job done. One issue with the film is that there are points where it reminds me of a late-night Cinemax skin flick. There are some soft-core porn sequences that feel placed in the film to attract that audience base. I feel it cheapens the movie and takes the focus off of a relatively decent storyline. \"The Butterfly Effect 2\" stands on its own and doesn't require anyone who didn't see the first film from grasping what's happening. It's strictly for people who enjoyed \"The Butterfly Effect\" and couldn't get enough or those who never saw it and just happen upon this one first.",

I say \"remake\" because, even if the characters and situations are different, apart from that the overall plot is just a washed out (very washed out, mind you) version of the original title.There's nothing original here, no depth, the characters aren't even likable, why should I care for the main guy, when he seems to be using his \"butterfly effect\" just because he feels bored?

I somewhat liked the characters and though some (sadly) unexploited relationships (Nick - Bristol, for example)BUT! I'm kind of having the feeling I have only seen just a part of the movie! Every twist Nick caused in his reality ... wasn't well argued... we didn't see some explanation, some feeling of his character adapting to that reality... Secondly... I definitely think that he gave up too easily. Remember the first part... how Kutcher tries every possibility before he gives up ? Well, this time he tried 2 or 3 ways and that's it... Not to mention that every time he goes in some parallel reality, the story lasts too much... without necessarily adding something really important to the story. The plot is too superficial this time. Now, that we've accustomed to those time-twists, we have nothing to get stunned from. And with that, there goes the pleasure of seeing a movie!How about the orange-colored (and not dark-reddish) blood Nick wipes out of his face every time? Or why didn't they try harder on the effect of 'transportation' ? It's simply some minor twist/blur to the setting and that it.. poof, we're somewhere else!What the ****? I started moving in my chair 15 minutes before the movie was over, I could barely resist not closing it. It's like the whole movie is a set for a great ending that doesn't appear. Anyway, the ending I personally find ridiculous. The whole movie we see him going back in time, and that is HIS time, but the rest's too. What is wrong with the last time ? WHY did the director / editor feel it would be such a great idea to end the movie as him being his lover's baby?! Or, accepting this, why there is no emotional burst in the end, to make us feel that he had really sacrificed himself for the others, as he claims he would ?To summarize, I'd say that this movie accomplishes in some way to impress his viewers, in the way that you will probably get flabbergasted when rewinding it for analysis. The actors play quite well, I guess it's not their fault the story is mediocre... Indeed, this movie is mediocre, gave it 6/10 given the basic idea... and the beginning. But it's quite much.

Cast or crew members/friends? Kids? A little research shows that usually most \"reviewers\" doing this have reviewed only one, two or maybe five movies. The following 10/10 \"review\" for The Butterfly Effect 2 is from an IMdB member who has reviewed a grand total of two flicks! Here's the header: \n\" 10/10 Better than I thought it would be imafan41118 October 2006 \" \nThere's precious little to recommend this motion picture... the music is dreary, the acting amateurish, plot (what plot?), cinematography fair at best, pacing dull, uneven, script duh!, effects meh!... you get the idea. \nThe movie seems to have been put together by a bunch of smartypants juveniles who figure THEY know what's happening. Nope, they don't ! This is one to miss ~ at any time, in any time zone, in any universe. I rate it 2/10 because there are films that are worse. \n#",

A shameful effort at film-making. Avoid at all costs. I wasn't expecting a film of the same calibre as the first but this was about as bad as a film gets - tedious, boring and doesn't follow any of the aspects of the first - there seems no point in him bringing his dull friends back to life as he is out for himself and what good is that from a main character - he has no likable traits and also there is no explanation behind why he can go back in time and when he does - even for the first time he doesn't seem surprised at what he just did - he just looks around for 2 seconds and then kind of goes like oh OK I've gone back in time.... absolute rubbish.",

            "content": "I adore the original movie! It has a wonderful story, that is also deep and even thought provoking. It maybe dark and thrilling, but it's a still a movie worth watching. Because it was successful with young adult audience, New line cinema decided to create a sequel to it's hit. And since they already proved they can do sequels well with Final destination 2, doing one for Butterfly effect wouldn't be a big of a deal. Unfortunately, this is something that most fans wished would happen. Since it's not one of those cases.Sadly, the plot is a rehash of the first movie, it also features the new main character, in that case Nick Larson (Eric Lively), saving his girlfriend Julie (Erica Durance) from a car crash. And later he tries to fix his timeline again several times, including his attempt to try to get a better position at work. What's upsetting, is that, despite being a rehash of the first movie, it doesn't have the same charm as before. The characters have no backstory outside of the birthday in the nature scene, thus making the movie shallow. Not to mention, there's no good explanation on why Nick has the powers to time travel. Not to mention, that the office environment is very boring and unfitting for a sci-fi kind of film. And how the protagonist tries to use his powers just to get a promotion.But that's only the tip of the iceberg. It also has underdeveloped characters. Nick is just a terrible protagonist. Because he's very egotistical, and mostly cares about his career instead of friends and family. Sure, in the beginning it feels like he cares about Julie, but as the plot moves on, it feels less and less genuine. He does some stupid mistakes, which I won't spoil, but his actions were inexcusable! Unlike Evan in the original, who truly tried to help his friends and fix mistakes for a good reason. Other characters were just generic. Julie is the love interest who is also a photographer, Amanda and Trevor are just friends who aren't memorable at all, and Dave Bristol the boss, who wants his company to succeed. None of the characters are good. Maybe the best character is Nick's mom, who is the only one who cares about her son's mental health after the car crash accident. At least she felt like Andrea Treborn in the 2004 movie.Lastly, this movie had terrible camera work and weird soundtrack. For example, it would zoom into Nick's face during the car crash scene, instead of focusing on different angles. Sure, I never filmed a movie in my life, but still, it's very noticeable, it sticks out like a sore thumb. As for the soundtrack, it's the same as before, except, it's placed in random scenes, that just don't get along. For Example, after Julie is saved from the accident, she and Nick decided to, say in an appropriate way, make out and kiss in the bed. They played Kayleigh's funeral song, which is obviously a very sad one, that definitely doesn't fit the scene. Again, I'm not a director, but even I can point it out.Overall, I feel like in the right hands, Butterfly effect could have been the next Final destination for New line cinema, since the original was great. However, I feel like the movie, both with it's writing and technical stand point, was done by amateurs. It had none of the original's charm or creativity while making this. They didn't even mention diaries, black outs, emotional traumas or anything like that even once. My best recommendation is to skip this sequel at all cost, no matter if you seen the first movie or not. In fact, I'd rather advise you to either watch other time travelling films like Back to the future or Groundhog day, another Ashton Kutcher movie like What happens in Vegas or Open season (despite the movies being comedies) or even trying to write one yourself. No matter what you choose, any of the options is better than wasting time on this cheap sequel. I really got bored when watching this film, and I feel terrible that the franchise went this bad route.",

I mean, one simply does not have the right to ruin our expectations and warp the Butterfly Effect title in our minds just for some quick cash.A relatively short film with universally awful scenario, casting, special effects, audio and acting. I am an optimistic person, I expected an even greater scenario with a really shocking ending, great acting, lots of variety in locations and people. At the very start I was a bit worried but it didn't remain like that, it turned into disappointment. And my expectations faded with every passing moment, vanishing in the final scene.My only wish for Butterfly Effect 2 is that, it should suffer heavy failure in terms of box office, so it would be an example for all potential let downs. We don't want another ruined title.There is nothing interesting in this film, except for those who crave for some standard erotic scenes. Go watch some rush hour traffic, or do nothing at all.

Primarily because I wasn't sure it was going to be worth bothering with since it has nothing to do worth the original and has a predictable stretch of a script. If I were to have written a sequel, pardon the follow-the-crowd, I would have made it a prequel. It simply makes more since. There are numerous possibilities. You could have gone with the crazy father from the first one who used photos he took to go back. Also, you could have used the other children who were still-borns which would suggest they did the same as he did in the Director's cut. As I said, lots of options. Why do screenwriters create a sequel that is a similar story without any solid link to the first? Just for the fun of it, why don't they do it anyway? Just make a couple of prequels with semi-known actors and a decent script, and then, maybe people will actually want to bother. Thanks.",

The story was predictable and not horribly in-depth. The one slightly high point of the movie was Erica Durance. She is a beautiful woman and has talent (as shown in Smallville) although i think that this movie doesn't allow her to fully stretch out and show the full extent of her talents.

In regards to the screenplay, the only thing it has in common with the first part is the concept, no continuity no nothing. The dialogue is fairly simpletonish, but you can clearly see that the actors, well most of them, try their best to get the job done. In my opinion, the people in charge should have waited a little longer to get a bigger budget in order to get at least the screenwriter from part one, although both the screenwriter and the director from the Butterfly Effect would have at least ensured a sequel capable to stand up to its expectations. But we all know that money is expensive and it doesn't grow on trees so I guess we'll have to wait for part three maybe, who knows..Bottom line if you are going to see this movie anyway, expect it to give you the feeling that you've waisted 3-4 hours of your life when in fact the movie only lasted 10 minutes.Peace",

In fact, the producers should have saved all of film used on this time-waster to shoot anything except this movie ... anything except this movie (please).A horrid nonsensical mess that all involved should dis-associate themselves from if they value their careers, a film produced only to cash in on the questionable value of this \"franchise\".Let's hope its the last we hear from it. To be avoided like the pox.",

The Butterfly Effect did an excellent job in exploring this concept, and was a remarkable film. However, this sequel only makes you wish you had that ability so you could go back to the point in your life just before you paid to see it, and save your money.The problem is not so much the actors (though they were mediocre at best), it's the writers and directors that are responsible for this awful garbage. It's always irritating to see something that was once good have it's name tarnished by someone hoping to make a few bucks, and that is exactly the case here. The story was absurd. In the first movie, all of his doctors couldn't figure out the situation, but in this movie the guy nails it by doing a yahoo search on his lunch break? Honestly, I could write up a story about 2 gay astronauts stuck in a bathroom in the year 2060, and cast Jim Varney and Chris Tucker as the lead roles, and it would still be better than this.There is not one redeeming quality to this movie. It's a perfect example of Hollywood bigwigs taking the name of something that was once great and attaching it to something awful in hopes of squeezing out a few more dollars. All involved in the production of this movie should change careers now, rethink their lives, and hope God has mercy on their souls.Like others have said, save your money and your time.",

The whole concept of changing the past, like in the first movie, was fascinating and the first movie was more entertaining, whilst this movie has degraded. The Whole concept of Time traveling and quantum Physics is very fascinating concept but the sequel made it all boring. Totally waste of my time watching the sequel. The first Butterfly effect is totally original, very real. This, however, was just Pointless.

The little research Nick did on alternate realities in association to migraines and finding a newspaper clipping of Evan's father's sickness was a good touch but like I said, I wished they had explored that angle further.Instead, they took the romance angle, which was fine but they could've done more. At the end, it gave me the distinct impression that Butterfly Effect 2 was a setup for something else. As if they needed to show this movie before really getting into something more.And Eric Lively is a capable actor, and Erica Durance did well with the material she's given. It ain't rocket science so I don't hold them to standards of the critical kind.

His phone rings, he pulls it out has a look and then throws it into the abyss and says honey let's move to New York!... A crappy Hollywood ending I know, but at least it makes sense!Also the poorly thought out time travel through pictures concept raised an issue with me and had me thinking last night about the illogical ending of the original movie.

In the original we were shown how the main characters life was before he changed it for the first half hour or so and could relate to his feelings. We were given no history into this character whatsoever and the amount of time he spent changing his life meant we could never really get used to him as he was constantly changing his memories.
