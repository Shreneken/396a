            "content": "First off, I definitely don't think this movie deserves to have such a low rating. Mind you, I thought this movie was going to reek to high heaven when I saw the trailers. My expectations were extremely, extremely low. I enjoyed the other films the Wayans Bros. did. There is no doubt that they are all talented comics. I just feel that they're a little overrated. Sometimes people seem to talk about the Wayans Bros. like they're the new Zucker brothers. I don't think they will EVER reach those heights in comedy. One of the things I feared about \"Little Man\" was most of the humor was going to consist of bathroom gags. The movie has its small share of bathroom humor, but never overdoes it. After seeing the previews for movies like \"The Pacifier,\" I was afraid there was going to be some joke involving diaper-changing. Stuff like that was funny back when \"Three Men and a Baby\" came out, but now it just makes me want to roll my eyes and cringe. \"Little Man\" didn't have one of those stupid gags, and that was a breath of fresh air for me. I found myself laughing through about 70% of the film, and the cast does a fine job. The only weak link was Tracy Morgan, who was funny on SNL, but the character he plays in this movie is just plain obnoxious. The gorgeous Brittany Daniel, who was also in \"White Chicks,\" provides some great eye candy. And the monotone-speaking comedian Fred Stoller provides some really funny, scene-stealing moments. Even Chazz Palminteri gets into the act, playing a gangster (I know, not exactly a stretch for him, but he adds some class to the film). Keep on the lookout for Rob Schneider, who has an amusing cameo. And last but not least, John Witherspoon never fails to please. Marlon Wayans's rubberfaced comedy style gets a little annoying at times, but I can't deny that the mere image of him as a midget is pretty damn hilarious. My advice is ignore the low rating and tons of bad reviews and give the film a chance. As I said before, I thought this was just going to be another brainless comedy",

            "content": "I promise that this review will be very little since there is not much to say about the latest Wayans Brothers short film \"Little Man\". OK, so maybe it is not that short in running time but it does fall short on witticism. Marlon Wayans stars as Calvin, the midget convict who pretends to be a baby to a married couple that inadvertently possesses a jewel which he wants to seize. Shawn Wayans & Kerry Washington play the gullible couple. Director Keenan Ivory Wayans does size \"Little Man' up a bit with a few \"ga-ga\" gag scenes featuring pseudo-baby Calvin, but not enough for \"Little Man\" to stand tall as a favorable comedy. *** Average",

            "content": "Ripping this movie apart is like shooting fish in a barrel. It's too easy. So I'm going to challenge myself to acknowledge the positive aspects of Little Man. First, I'm impressed with the special effects. It really did look like Marlon Wayans' head was attached to the body of a little person. I never doubted it for a minute.Secondly, I loved some of the unexpected cameos. David Alan Grier played an annoying restaurant singer, and his renditions of \"Havin' My Baby\" and \"Movin' On Up\" were priceless. John Witherspoon, who, coincidentally, played Grier's father in 1992's Boomerang (if you remember, he \"coordinated\" the mushroom belt with the mushroom jacket) now plays Vanessa's father in Little Man. So that was fun.Beyond that, this movie is about as believable as White Chicks. How dumb is it when even the doctor can't tell that it's a 40-year-old man and not a baby? He's got a full set of teeth!!! How is it possible that no one seems to notice that it's not a baby? Little Man is so bad that there's a Rob Schneider cameo. And please, if you're stupid enough to waste $8 on this movie, at least do me a favor and DO NOT bring your children. This movie is way too sexual for small children (lots of jokes and innuendo about sex, going down, eating out, etc.), and I felt embarrassed for the parents who brought their kids to the screening I was forced to endure. If you insist on seeing an idiotic film, as least spare your children the pain and suffering.",

They are chased by the police, and Calvin hides the stone in the purse of the executive Vanessa Edwards (Kerry Washington), whose husband Darryl Edwards (Kerry Washington) wants to have a baby. Percy convinces Calvin to dress like a baby and be left in front of the Edwards's house to get inside the house and retrieve the diamond. Darryl and Vanessa keep Calvin for the weekend and decide to adopt him, while Walken threatens Darryl to get the stone back.I was curious to see \"Little Man\" after being nominated and awarded with the Razzie Award. Of course this film is not a masterpiece, but what else could I expect from a movie directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans? Honestly, if I did not like this genre, I would never spend my time watching it. This movie is politically incorrect, and has the same sub-standard of the franchises \"American Pie\" and \"Scary Movie\", or \"The 40 Year Old Virgin\", with many gross, scatological and low level jokes. But I laughed a lot, specially with the references to \"Brokeback Mountain\" and \"Chucky\". My vote is five.Title (Brazil): \"O Pequenino\" (\"The Little One\")",

I loved their Scary Movie 2 and even enjoyed White Chicks. Little Man, however, had very few laughs and the jokes were stale.Obviously, the joke will revolve around Marlon Wayans, who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, steal a diamond meant for a gangster. Things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. In order to get the diamond back, the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep. Of course, he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond.The movie has some actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live like Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider as well from In Living Colour. All these talents, however, cannot help the poor script and the jokes which simply was not funny.The special effects to make Marlon Wayans to look like a midget was OK. I mean, it was not 100% believable but it was OK...nothing great. I just wish that the Wayans brothers had put more effort into developing a script with good jokes rather than trying to shore up their poor script with cameos from their famous comedic actors and actresses.Wait for it on cable or television. It really is not worth any amount of money.",

The more people there are who pay to see this movie, the more it proves what bad tastes we have.Let me encourage us to be better than that! Show the money guys in Hollywood there really is a point of classlessness that we won't allow them to sink below in the pursuit of profit from us!!

But I liked \"White Chicks\", I proudly admit, and I like the Waynes brothers, wither you want to admit it or not, they give you a few good laughs in most of their films. So, I figured to just try to give Little Man a chance, what harm could it do? Honestly, it wasn't that bad, I actually had a decent time watching this.Calvin is a two foot criminal on the run with a hundred thousand dollar diamond and while running from the cops, puts it in a lady's purse. Cal and his partner follow the couple and since Calvin is so little and the couple, Darryl and Venessa, wants a baby, Cal dresses up as one and the couple takes him in. Thinking it will be for a short while, Cal does this hoping to get the diamond and run, but it won't be easy since Darryl is dedicated to being a good dad.Like I said, I was expecting something really bad, but I had a couple laughs during the film. I honestly don't understand what people have against the Waynes brothers, while Little Man is in no way Oscar material, it was a silly comedy with a few light hearted laughs.5/10",

Hope that you'll never have to endure anything this awful again. *cough* Razzie award *cough*I disliked this movie because it was unfunny, predictable and inane. While watching I felt like I was in a psychology experiment to determine how low movie standards could get before people complained. When I requested my money back at the end of the movie I was informed that because I watched the whole thing 'I wasn't entitled to reimbursement'. I was told by the assistant manager that several people had complained and gotten refunds already though.The movie summary is pretty basic. The midget thief steals a diamond and the poses as a baby to elude police. Underneath this clever outline however, lies a repertoire of original, fresh and hilarious skits. Or not.Ask yourself the following: Do you like to see people getting hit by pans? Do you like fart jokes? Do you like to see midgets posing as babies threatened with a thermometer in the anus? Do you like tired racial jokes? Do you think babies say 'goo goo goo goo goo gaa gaa'? Do you drool?If you answered 'yes' to any of the above then this movie is definitely for you. Although it has been billed in some places as 'The Worst Movie of the Decade', there is probably a movie or 2 that are worse...somewhere. I can't say for sure. I gave this movie 2 stars because we all know a review with only one star would indicate bias on the part of the reviewer and then the review wouldn't be taken seriously. This lowbrow comedy is intended for a less intelligent audience and I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone. Save your money for something funny.Respect",

It's not nearly as bad as I thought people have said it was. It's not even close to being a bad film. There are even some sweet moments in this film.

Not the movie's resolution, but the actual end where we all stood up and walked out.I gave this movie one star, but it clearly deserves less. I don't feel that the six minutes they spent writing the script is worth a star. This does deserve a Razzie and I pray to God it gets it.When are people going to learn; if you stop paying to see this idiocy they will stop pooping it out. Seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this film. Avoid it at all costs. You have been warned.",

But in here, not only does the premise defy all logic, not only is the acting terrible, not only is the entire movie offensive from start to finish, not only is the direction as amateurish as you can find, but they actually want you to pay to see this film. Maybe if it was free...naaah, it would still be a waste of time.Usually I'd be inclined to write some long winded, detailed review about why this film is so bad, but just suffice to say that let my brevity do the talking.

I was impressed at how seamlessly they were able to put Marlon Wayans' head on the body of a small person. There were some good comedic moments, some funnier than others.

That Woman is Vanessa(Kerry Washington) in which her husband Darryl(Shawn Wayans) eagerly wants to have a kid, in hopes to be a good dad. But her career keeps getting in the way. Calvin pretends to be a baby left on her doorstep, so he can get the diamond back.

            "content": "From the producer/actor of \"Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood\" and director of the hits Scary Movie 1 & 2, Kennan Ivory Wayans has created a truly original work of garbage with \"Little Man.\" A picture that should have died on the storyboard designs alone (if there were any), \"Little Man\" does little else than replay too many children's films put out by Nickelodeon with a twist that the person that you're supposed to be paying attention to (the once-talented Marlon Wayans) just happens to be a little guy with Marlon's head.I think what the team of brothers was thinking was the same thing the team working on \"Babe\" (talking-pig and animal movie) were thinking when technology proposed new sights to be seen on movie screens worldwide...let's cut and paste Marlon's head on every one of his shots and bring in a jewel-heist twist to give the character a bad-guy edge and try to work in the fact that he has to pretend to be a baby for 3 days while he tries to get the jewels that these newfound \"parents\" have in their possession.Well, this movie gets a few laughs when it came to adult-jokes, but it didn't make a whole lot of sense that Shawn Wayans' character, Darryl, didn't notice the \"baby\" making love to his wife, played by Kerry Washington (from \"Ray\" and prior TV fame). The acting was decent, but it didn't really matter because the whole film was more like an expos\u00e9 on film-making technology than any real story-telling and good humor put into it.I gave the film 4 stars out of 10. It deserves maybe a star more for its others actors, such as John Witherspoon (Friday) and Chazz Palminteri (how did the makers of this film get this guy?).

            "content": "\"Little Man\" (2006) Directed By: Keenen Ivory Wayans Starring: Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, Kerry Washington, Tracy Morgan, John Witherspoon, Lochlyn Munro, & Chazz Palminteri MPAA Rating: \"PG-13\" (for crude and sexual humor throughout, language and brief drug references) I could begin this review by telling you that I expected this to be a funny movie and that I really did want to see it\u0085but I don't want to lie. I expected this to be an awfully unfunny comedy and I really did not want to see it. Some of you may think that this is harsh and that this completely discredits my review\u0085but, really, you cannot tell me that anyone actually expected this to be a good movie. Does the tagline \"From the Writers of 'White Chicks'!\" really make you want to see this movie? \"White Chicks\" was a miserable disaster of a movie and yet it managed to make double its budget at the box-office. This didn't and still doesn't surprise me. Teen audiences can be manipulated into watching anything and the Wayans brothers always equal big teen audiences. So, when filmmakers get away with a bad movie (and make plenty of money in doing so), I don't expect anything better with their next project. Well, my expectations were right. \"Little Man\" is just as bad as \"White Chicks\"\u0085not worse, but on par in terms of mediocrity. The worst thing about this is that \"Little Man\" isn't horrible. It just isn't good. It floats around in this sad, disastrous level of weakness where no jokes work and the stars all walk along without very much care or interest in the movie.Darryl Edwards (Shawn Wayans) wants nothing more than to be a father\u0085but his wife, Vanessa (Washington), has other things on her mind, namely her career. She has just gotten a promotion and is not yet ready to give up her soaring career for a family. Calvin Sims (Marlon Wayans) is a vertically-challenged criminal who, along with his buddy Percy (Morgan), is has just stolen a priceless diamond and is now on the run from the police. For no reason at all (though, we are expected to accept it), Calvin drops the diamond in Vanessa's purse and then plans to retrieve it later on. He poses as an abandoned baby and Darryl and Vanessa take him in and begin to care for them. As Calvin continuously tries to snag the diamond and escape, he must watch out for Vanessa's odd father, Pops (Witherspoon), and must never falter in his role as an infant. Okay, okay, okay, I forgave the stupidity of the plot of \"White Chicks\", because\u0085well, I guess that I was feeling generous. But, as I didn't really want to see this movie to begin with, I certainly wasn't feeling at all generous this time around. But, even for the most gullible (or charitable) viewers, this plot just requires far too much forgiveness. It is one of the most unbelievable, ridiculous plots to hit theaters this year and is shockingly embarrassing. The Wayans brothers have never developed a worse plot.When discussing the plot, there are so many ludicrously moments that I don't even know where to start. First and foremost (I suppose) is the fact that Darryl and Vanessa actually believe that Calvin is a baby. I can forgive them ignoring his extra-long\u0085um, organ, yet them ignoring his tattoos and the fact that he pushes Vanessa's head down towards his crotch just disgusted me. These people must have been the most brainless people ever put on the big screen! Now, let's discuss the plot point that propelled the entire movie. After Calvin and Percy steal the diamond, they run into a store where Darryl and Vanessa just happen to be shopping. The police also run in and are looking for Percy (no one ever tells them that a three-foot tall little man helped him still the gem) and yet Calvin quickly drops the diamond in Vanessa's purse. The police then leave, never spotting Calvin or Percy. My question is: what really was the point of Calvin dropping the diamond in Vanessa's purse? Did it miraculously stop the police from spotting him? Yes, the filmmakers clearly think that we are all idiots and we wouldn't notice how desperate this action was. Now, the cherry on top is the ending. If you bought that ending for one millisecond, then I can gather two things about you: you probably think that \"White Chicks\" was \"sweet\" or \"freaking awesome\" and you probably think that the Wayans brothers are the most innovative filmmakers since Martin Scorsese (or, more likely, Uwe Boll). I don't mean to offend anyone, honestly, but this is probably true (key word: probably).I shall focus on the positive now, because, well, I'm sick of being negative. \"Little Man\" has a few funny moments\u0085not many, but a few. On top of that, the special effects used to create Calvin are really not that bad. They aren't groundbreaking, but they serve their purpose well enough, I suppose. Okay, I'm done with the positive. \"Little Man\" is not good. It's stupid, unfunny, and just plain embarrassing at times. The ending is, if anything, worse. It is unbelievable and makes no sense. I found myself yawning more than laughing. \"Little Man\" proves that, if we continue to see movies made without much care from filmmakers, then we will continue to see such bad movies. The Wayans brothers haven't done anything to improve their craft since their last disaster\u0085and may have gotten even worse.Final Thought: The most interest you will get out of this movie is trying to count up how many times Chazz Palminteri has played and will play the exact same part in equally-bad movies.Overall Rating: 2/10 (C-)",

The plot is ludicrous, the characters are completely one-dimensional OR completely UN-likable.I was in a session that had only 12 people there - 4 people left during the movie - I don't think they even made it to halfway! What really bugs me here is that someone thought this story was worth spending however many millions on it, but was it? No, it was not. Great scripts pile up all over Hollywood EVERY DAY and take years for someone to get to them, if they ever do. Good Will Hunting took several years to get from script to screen - and yet here we have this total dross forced on us as a supposed summer comedy, it's just so unfair! Will someone in Hollywood PLEASE start taking a few risks or we will be subjected to this total garbage time and time again.This movie is so awful I would not even recommend ANYONE to watch it EVER - not even free on TV (where it will be soon I am sure).My last comment is for the Wayans brothers - are you ashamed of yourselves and of this torture you inflicted on people?

I had never seen this film before but I have heard awful things about it. But I decided to give it a view anyway. I tend to like the films that most critics hated. I thought it was pretty funny. The plot is pretty simple. A dwarf named Calvin, played by Marlon Wayans, and his partner in crime Percy, played by Tracy Morgan, steal a valuable diamond from a jewelry store and are supposed to give it to a ruthless crime boss, played by Chazz Palminteri. But when Calvin and Percy are being chased by the cops, Calvin dumps the diamond in a lady's purse. So in order to get the diamond back Calvin decides to act like a baby who was dropped off at a doorstep. Vanessa and Darryl, a childless couple, find Calvin and decide to keep him and raise them as their own. Because they think he's an orphaned baby. And Vanessa was the lady who's purse the diamond was dropped in. Sounds absurd right? You bet it is! It certainly is one of the worst plots for a film that I have ever heard of. But it works in this film. And seeing Calvin, actually a 40 year old man, dress up in baby clothes and lying in a crib and being held by the adults was pretty funny. There are several scenes that made me laugh. It didn't' bring tears to my eyes by any means from laughing but it was good mindless entertainment. I wouldn't necessarily call it one of the worst films I have ever seen because I didn't think it was that bad but it's definitely not good. Sure, there were some scenes that made you think, \"oh, come on, how could they have not known he wasn't a baby? how could they have not realized that?\" and it does make you roll your eyes but it was still funny to see this \"little man\" get his diamond back. Some of the sexual innuendo did go a little too far at times and we could've done without that but I thought it was still pretty funny. One of the funniest scenes that come to mind was when David Alan Grier was singing to Vanessa and Darryl in the restaurant when Vanessa was trying to tell Darryl that she got the promotion. That scene generated the most laughs. Anyway Little Man isn't one of the greatest films ever made but I think any fan of the Wayans Brothers will like this one. It's definitely not for the easily offended. I enjoyed it though. Thank you for reading my review!",

The Wayans brothers stamp was a warning to me, but my family really wanted to see it, so we did.All of the comedy boils down to gross out gags, but these gags aren't funny in the slightest. The only people that could laugh at this are 12 year old boys who think that the word \"hump\" is the peak of comedy. The story line is completely ludicrous, and it requires a suspension of disbelief that impossible for any human to achieve. You wonder how these characters can manage to be this stupid.The acting is terrible, I'm talking as bad as \"The Room\" or \"Fateful Findings\". The performances are so flat that you can almost see the prompter that they're reading off of behind the camera.By far the worse part was the effects. The \"baby\" effect of shrinking down Marlon Wayans is so awful that it takes what little scraps of realism this movie had and throws it out the window. SKIP THIS MOVIE!",

            "content": "Another Wayans Brothers comedy which has Marlon Wayans as a midget outlaw, performing only with his head as he plays the upper half that's been CGI'd onto the tiny body of a midget actor (10-year-old Linden Porco). The crook has just gotten out of jail and then steals a supersized diamond which gets into the hands of a childless married couple (Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington). So the crook disguises himself as a whining baby and lands on their doorstep. The grateful couple takes him in and from then on it's juvenile laughs galore, and many of them quite funny depending on how much you're able to check your brain at the door and get a kick out of this brand of utter nonsense. The whole idea is so completely absurd and stupid - after all, how can so many adults not easily recognize that this is really a 40-year-old midget in a bonnet? - that it's kind of funny, at least to me. And you can't blame baby Wayans for wanting to breast feed off the highly titillating Brittany Daniel! I often think alleged charges of ripping off other film sources in movies are exaggerated, but in this case there's no doubt the filmmakers were stealing from a Bugs Bunny cartoon wherein a little gangster named \"Baby Faced Finster\" impersonates an infant. Nowhere is this more blatant than in a deleted scene cut from the released film where a peeping character observes the \"baby\" through a bathroom keyhole, wearing a tattoo and smoking a cigar while shaving. I wonder if it was deleted because it's such an obvious steal from Bugs, but it did look amusing and would have worked in the film. I don't like the pattern I'm seeing of more and more CGI characters being used in place of actors films, but I have to admit it was interesting how they pulled this off by grafting the head of Marlon Wayans onto the body of the little actor Linden Porco to achieve the effect. **1/2 out of ****",

I like how Calvin was acting as a child, that was jokes. The plot is pretty simple and basic. The ending was good, I like how Darryl finds out that Calvin is really a dwarf criminal and how they team up to fight the criminals that were looking for the jewel when they came to the house. It was jokes when ever Calvin was talking and how is was fighting the guys..it was kind of stupid but whatever.Like I said, I was expecting something really bad, but I had a couple laughs during the film.

Little Man fits the latter (obviously) and is the worst movie that I have seen at the time I am typing this.Anyway, onto the movie. Have you ever seen that one Bugs Bunny cartoon with the really short criminal who disguises as a baby to get the cops off his tail and hide his stolen money and Bugs takes him in? Imagine that cartoon only much longer and less funnier. That is Little Man in a nutshell. A really short criminal disguises himself as a baby to get the cops off his tail and to take back a stolen diamond that has ended up with a young couple and they take him in.This movie is filled with unfunny slapstick, unfunny writing and feces jokes. I was waiting for an nut hit counter to appear in the corner of the screen since it happens so often. It's not funny the first time it happens and it's even less funny the last time it happens.Aside from the jokes, other things in the movie are just plain dumb. Like in one scene the couple give the criminal a bath showing his tattoos yet they assume that it was his past guardians that made him get him or another scene were they take him to a supposedly qualified doctor who cannot tell he is an adult and another scene where he gets beating up by a hockey player for some reason (I don't remember the details too well because I don't care) is seen relatively unharmed in the next scene. I guess you can say I'm nitpicking and thinking about it too much but that's what happens when you watch a crappy movie, you're mind starts to wander.And then there is the epic final slapstick battle with the worst movie gangsters (Something to do with the criminal owing them a ton of money or something) I have ever seen, Fat Tony and his gang from Simpsons are more threatening than those bozos. And it all ends in, what else? A nut shot.And the music. Sweet Jesus, Buddha and Shiva, it is generic in sound form. Dopey orchestrated comedy music. But now I'm just rambling on about music that no one cares about, so I think it's time to wrap this up.So unless you want to say to your friends that you have seen one of the worst movies of all time, I say skip it and just watch the Bugs Bunny cartoon, Baby Buggy Bunny.",

And yet, the Wayans still have the courage to make this \"Little Man\".The story (to qualify it somehow), is a pilfering from the 1954 Looney Tunes short \"Baby Buggy Bunny\"; and tells about Calvin, a thief of a meter of height (Marlon Wayans) that steals a diamond and hides it in the bag of a happy pair, Darryl and Vanessa (Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington). The way to recover it will be impersonated as a baby. A baby, by the way, that goes unnoticed without anyone, at any time, suspect him. It must be that he does not grow a beard, and that it is normal for him to have a 32-piece dentition (or more, judging by the scenes in which Marlon Wayans opens his mouth, there are a few).As the script does not give for more than, say, about 10 minutes, the rest of the footage goes on to show us gags as novel as the supposed baby looking at Brittany Daniel's breasts, putting hand to several girls, or hitting the noble parts of almost every man who appears on the screen more than a second and a half. He's not into humor any more, of course. Also, this movie is very sexist, the female characters come out exclusively to serve as a sexual object, by the way (from Vanessa, the mother to Walken's girlfriend). But the Wayans Bros. are still in the 50's?In the end, in case you have not guessed it already, the thief becomes good, the father forgives that he is a delinquent who has been deceiving them, and the viewer leaves wanting to have given his money a better destination, as the bottom of a sewer. But most serious of all is that there will be people who even laugh. How the Wayans must be laughing, watching the people leave their rooms at the box office.And to finish, how I would have liked to act in that film as a policeman, where after capturing Walken and his bandits, forcing Walken's girlfriend to marry a Japanese man (because that actress was probably born in 1964, the year of the Olympics in Tokyo).",

I mean how can you not like the seen where they say goodbye to each other and he kisses their friend with the tongue. That's comic on a high level.

Calvin must now pose as a young infant in order to retrieve the stolen diamond.

There are a few gems in there, but you have to trudge through a load of pap to get to the goodies. I'm Gonna Get You Sucka!, was a tidy homage to the blaxploitation sub-genre, offering plenty of laughs, but referencing its subject with respect. Mo' Money isn't everyone's favourite film, but it's fresh and funny enough to catch it when it's ever on TV. After A Low Down Dirty Shame, their output became more and more smutty, and the scripts relied on bodily fluid gags rather than actual intellectual humour.This is where this film lies.Littleman is another high concept idea that is executed poorly, and once the titular character is transformed into a toddler, the film resorts to racial, toilet, orifice, and competitive dad jokes, and it becomes lethargic very quickly.It's not funny, it verges on offensive, and the racial undertones just don't sit right in what should have been a family film. And there is one bedroom scene that is judged so badly, it ruins the rest of the film.When a Rob Schneider cameo is the best thing about a film, times are a changing for the writers.Scary Movie had a lot to answer for comedies in the noughties, arguable one of the poorest decades for American comedy.At least John Witherspoon is good.

And all us movie geeks know that is saying a LOT, given this man's past roles, and his talent. I used to think he was overrated as an actor. Then I figured OK, I see what all the fuss is about. Now, he's up there with my favorite actors of all time, with James Woods, Steve Buscemi, Robert Deniro...probably in the top 5. I was lucky enough to see a free screening this afternoon and boy, am I glad I had the privilege. In fact, this review might not even be that coherent- it's one of those movies that blows you away so much that you have trouble even putting your feelings into words. The plot line sounds trite when you first describe it (it did to me when I first heard about it), Marlon Wayans plays a midget thief who pretends to be a baby.I found myself laughing out loud in this movie so many times, most of it horrified, amazed laughter at what is happening and the things that are coming out of the character's mouths, especially Wayan's. He had at least a dozen lines that had every member of the audience in hysterics and actual applause and cheers. I can't say enough good things about this movie. You think, after the first five minutes, that you know how the movie will end. Well, Wayan's opening narrative does give it away, but trust me, the events unfold in a way that you will NEVER see coming. You will swear you can see what a character is going to do next, what violent or self-destructive act they will commit, but you turn out to be wrong.Without getting too pretentious here, the movie lives up to it's hype. The characters are not what they seem, up until the end, and even then they surprise you. At least two characters that you are POSITIVE you have figured out, do or say something that turns all your preconceptions of them upside down, while making your jaw drop, and your heart ache.

At the start of the movie, I did notice that Calvin appeared to be played by multiple actors and possibly a dummy. But after that, I was convinced that there was a very short African-American man I had never heard of, which seemed unlikely. Everything looked so real, at least on a 13-inch TV screen. I finally found out the man whose face I saw was Marlon Wayans. He does quite a good job. I mean for this type of material.Tracy Morgan comes across as a moron, but the fact is he gives the same type performance on \"30 Rock\" and that show gets nominated for Emmys. The writing on that show is more intelligent, though, and the Tracy Jordan character more complex, though on a superficial level Percy and Tracy Jordan are a lot alike.Chazz Palminteri makes a convincing and not cartoonish villain. In most scenes, his performance would be worthy of a more serious movie.One scene that is quite well done involves Darryl with his \"baby\" in the middle of the night. Vanessa comes in and sees he really will make a good father someday.Another highlight involves Molly Shannon and a diaper change--and a Peterbilt. Absolutely amazing. Editing and good stunt work can make anything plausible. Don't try this at home!One user review of this movie says people getting hit in the head is not funny. Oh, yes it is, and has been since Moe did it to Larry and Curly and even dating back to the days of silent movies. I do think they overdo the trademark of \"America's Funniest Home Videos\", which is getting hit in the crotch. But it's still funny, especially when unexpected. There are a few scenes with empty-headed gorgeous girls showing how good they look. They have kids!I do have some problems with plausibility. I know, look at the movie we're dealing with here. But certain laws of science are violated. I suppose I should just accept this because it's a live-action cartoon.And a doctor can't tell this is a grown man (who isn't going to grow any more than that)? Now if it were Dr. Hartman on \"Family Guy\" or that quack from \"30 Rock\" Dr. Spaceman ... but this man seems halfway intelligent.Other problems are attributed to the senility of Vanessa's father, but he seems perfectly healthy.Another thing I don't get: the couple live in a nice house in a nice neighborhood and drive a BMW, and the husband can't afford a ring? Why would the wife be so accepting of this? I have a theory: child services is closed on weekends (in the real world there would surely be something for endangered children, though the couple refused to go to the cops) but Vanessa has to go to work while Darryl stays home with the \"baby\". This makes it Sunday. This isn't explained, but Vanessa apparently makes more money than her husband if she has to go in on Sunday and dresses professionally. So her husband can't afford the ring but wants to wait until he can. Right? I guess it works. This film is not for kids. Even though it has kids, they shouldn't watch. Even as edited, it has way too many curse words, and some sexual humor almost too deviant to get past network censors. Although Seth MacFarlane's cute and cuddly characters have gotten away with just as much. It is worth it to see one breast-feeding joke start out with the \"baby\" expecting something wonderful and getting stuck with ... less.It's a fun and touching film, but just don't expect to feel more intelligent afterward.",

The Wayans work together well and, you can tell they enjoyed making this movie. Great special effects. If you are not familiar with Marlon Wayons, you would actually believe he was that small. Some great cameo parts, particularly Rob Schneider from Deuce Bigalow fame. Certainly not for very young kids to watch and, as for other children...

One and a half goddamn long hours you are heavily bombed with the most stupid jokes you have ever seen in your whole life. There was only one scene that made me at least smile, but the rest of the movie was awfully boring and silly. Additionally it is very annoying, that the jokes in the movie are often repeated up to 4 or 5 times (in a row!). Honestly, even a good joke isn't funny 5 times in a row, and these jokes weren't even funny at all.

            "content": "LITTLE MAN is by accounts a bad movie. To this day it has an appalling score of 4,4 and many of the reviews are mostly negative. Here we come to the main reason why I decided to watch: I heard so many bad things about it that I hoped to really hate this movie. Well, in the end I was wrong. I have to admit that despite some moments didn't gave me a chuckle, some did and the plot was very interesting.When the movie begins we see a very close shot of Calvin (Marlon Wayans) that is lifting weights when he is soon called for parole. After he leaves the prison, he joins his brother in a criminal action of stealing a diamond in a jewelry. But when the plan goes wrong, Calvin hides the diamond in Vanessa Edwards' bag and is dressed as a baby* for being ''adopted'' by Vanessa and her husband that hope to have a baby. While Vanessa and her husband Darryl (Shawn Wayans) try to take care of the ''kid'' (Calvin in disguise), his brother his threatened by a dangerous mob boss (Chazz Palminteri) and is up to Calvin and his foster parents stop them.So is this movie bad? No, it's not great but not terrible. Sure, many of the jokes may seem crude or mind-numbingly stupid (such as Calvin that from the cadle ends in Vanessa's bed, Darryl hit by a ball various times in the park, and the idiot criminals hit in the groin various times) and all the actors may seem disengaged in their performances, but in my opinion the only problem is that the movie had probably a good script but in the end result it was poorly executed. Too bad because it had potential.*If you haven't guessed it yet, Marlon Wayans plays a dwarf criminal that disguises as a bady for almost all the movie. In fact the first scene where we see him is a very close shot as we only see his head.",

Lame and predictable plot with Marlon treated as a baby and Shawn adapting to fatherhood. This leads to one of the stupidest climaxes of the year where they fend off bad guys. Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans who only proves that the poor quality of White Chicks is contagious. Marlon proves that being a toddler should be left by actual toddlers. Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington play a couple of morons who cannot seem to figure out that their idiot son has a grown man's face. Tracy Morgan plays Marlon's idiot accomplice. Any parental theme in this travesty should be discarded. Chazz Palminteri plays some mob type character and like the title character, it is a total shrinkage of his career. This is one of the worst films of the year and it should be placed in a diaper bag and heaved off a cliff. Parents need to raise their children to avoid films this bad. Score: 1 / 10",

The concept was basic to start with, but had the potential to be at least entertaining. Instead it is ruined by some really predictable, rushed and disconnected scenes, and the humour completely fails as well. Why? Because the jokes are unfunny and borderline offensive, and the script is absolutely dreadful having some inane and vomit-inducing dialogue.The production values are in some ways cheap, especially in the rushed editing, and the soundtrack didn't do much at all for me. The direction is smug and ineffectual and the characters are unlikeable and stereotyped. The acting doesn't help to lift, instead every performance because of the dialogue and how the characters are written falls flat.In conclusion, awful film and a contender for the worst of its year. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

Concerning the Wayans and Co. latest addition to the moving pictures scenario; Little Man. This United Kingdom P.G. (Parental Guidance), anyone under the age of twelve must be accompanied by a responsible adult, certificated movie, is the epitome of what has now developed into the worse case of dumbing down since cigarettes were \"wiped out\" from pictures of movie icons of the 1950's.The predominantly under twelve's audience here who, some without grown up supervision too, sat there, obediently, taking it all in, oblivious to their subject and the partly grown up features that Little Man portrays, in part at least too. Movies, in general, can do better than this poor attempt, while this nonsense is getting them in while they are still young and fresh, the biggest fear for the future of Cinema is that a child's ignorance just might carry on through to a grown up bliss. Cinema deserves more than this, and so do its ever growing, and in the literal sense too, audiences, this blatant cash cow feeds on the ever-impressionable minds of the young.There is no Cinema experience here, no open eyed wonder, no awe-inspiring respect to the magic of movies'. There is nothing but bewilderment and contempt, for the lack of substance, originality and its delivery of mind less tedium and parody of everything that is so now ultimately wrong with the Hollywood machine, for the sake of a quick buck, we must endure our future cinema audiences to the likes of this archetypal disaster movie.Will this have the likes of Hitchcock, Fassbinder, Leone, Kubrick and Schaffner reeling in their graves? Money they all liked, no doubt, but talent and exuberance for perfection and quality, and to a vast degree, respect for their profession and audience, they were never short off. We are seeing, once again, with the works of the Wayans clan another clich\u00e9 of bad taste, while the likes of White Chicks (2004) were in no doubt a stab at the bourgeoisie of American society. The irony here is that the two leading protagonists, played yet again, by the Wayans brothers, are so much undercover, that all recognition is non-existent, this makes for a better movie too, and it is the actor Terry Crews that gives White Chicks its substance and personality, not the Wayans.Yet again, with their pastiche of 1970's Blaxploitation movies, as with the 1988 movie I'm Gonna Git You Sucka, this to can be seen as a comical and amusing movie, with heavy weights as Isaac Hayes, Jim Brown, Bernie Casey and the gorgeous actress Ja'net Du Bois. The point being, that Little Man has absolutely no persona of any kind what so ever, he is shallow and narcissistic, with no appreciation or value toward his followers, he quickly dives in takes your money and before we know it, has hidden himself within the cogs of commercialism. There is no recognisable effort as to where our money has been spent, after Scary Movie (2000), things could only have gone up, but alas they did not, no great pondering of artistic value and no doubt that the instalment from these intrepid movie moguls' next movies shall be straight to video, one can only hope.The Wayans seem to have created a movie genre all by themselves, to a certain extent; they have bludgeoned to death the movie parody, they have watered down each and every avenue and with their inevitable style. They have slowly destroyed the reputation of the last one hundred years that Cinema have given us, may the ghosts of movies past be ever so humble in their judgement, as their growing audiences, so far, seem to be, for when the bubble bursts, may they be as understanding too.",

I eventually gave into curiosity and went to see it. About 20 minutes into it I realized that the internet forum was just \"trolling\" as they call it. The plot had no point, all of the humor required you to have a preexisting liking for the main characters, who I found to all be repulsive. Unless you are the type of person who likes to watch losers run around dating other losers and talking about their uniqueness on MTV, I'd strongly suggest steering clear of this movie.",

            "content": "This is indeed \"THE\" worst movie I have ever seen (And I do average about 150 movies per year). This movie is simply garbage - just garbage nothing more than just garbage.And I submit that anyone who finds this movie not a garbage (let alone being funny) intellectually challenged (regardless of how young the person might be).The story is so idiotic it is beyond expressing. Just to give you a flavor of what this movie is about: It is about a grown up con man who happens to be a migid but pretending to be a little child to be found at the door steps of a couple whom he accidentally hide a large diamond with. The couple apparently are so stupid that they do not realize from the size of this con man's penis (which is supposed to be the high-light comic part of the entire movie) that this is a grown up migid and not a child. Not to mention how these 2 couples don't see that this newly adopted child of theirs is a grown up migid after he sleeps and has sex with the woman (who is now his mother). The story is so sickening and so taboo it is beyond comprehension. To express how I felt after watching this movie (which I never finished watching as I left half way in between), the following can perhaps articulate my feelings:This movie is a proof that life is not fair. There are people dying of starvation in Africa in need of money to survive, and then we have the arrogance and the audacity to spend money on making garbage such as this movie. Just thinking of how many lives would have been saved had the producers of this movie spent the money on saving those lives and instead wasted on a garbage such as this movie, and it makes me want to cry. What is so sad is that the people associated with this movie continue to walk around on this planet and not publicly expressing their shame for being associated with this movie. Yes...life is indeed not only not fair, but in fact cruel.",

            "content": "As posted on www.filmmakerstower.com...My kids (9 and 12 years old) laughed quite loud sometimes. I did chuckle a few times.When you see Marlan Wayans's face on the body of a 4 year old, saying \"Mommy!\", you cannot help it but laugh. When that little man is stuck in a bag with a dog, it is funny. This story of a little man and his buddy (Shawn Wayans)trying to recuperate a stolen jewel, hidden unknowingly by a young African-American couple, reminds me somewhat of the 1987 Three Men and a Baby. In that story, a baby transforms the lives of 3 consummate bachelors. Unfortunately, the story in Little Man doesn't explore the psychology of parenthood. It explores however the various ways one can be hit in the nuts, it tries to make us laugh with poop, diarrhea, dog urine, things like that.In an unbearable car chase sequence, a woman changes her kids diaper as she chases little man's car. If it had all been a little more realistic, the movie would have worked, in my view. Yes, this is slapstick humor, but it is too exaggerated to be in any way amusing. It's too bad, because the effect of putting Marlan Wayans's head on a different body truly works, and that is no small feat! I found the \"making of\" section much more interesting than the film itself.After seeing this film, I cannot watch any image and take it as proof of reality. I might see George Bush, on television, but who is to say that the body attached to him is his? Apart from that, the film was not as gratifying for me as it was for my kids. So rent it for your kids, or if you are a special effect fan.",

I cringed when I saw the trailer for \"White Chicks\" awhile back, and thought there was no way that thing would make money. I rented \"White Chicks\" and the movie was funny, as in stupid funny. There are scenes in there that are so outrageous that I had to replay them because they were funny in the aforementioned \"stupid funny\" way.\"Little Man\" follows the same formula. After spoofing \"hood\" movies years ago, these guys take a silly premise, and surround their cartoon world with non-expensive white actors with talent, plenty of potty humor and attractive women to keep the interest of the 18-24 year-old males who enjoy this stuff.The graphics are not great. Transposing Marlon's head onto a little person is not seamless, but fifteen minutes into the story, you accept how it looks. Their homage to \"Baby Buggy Bunny\" is pretty much scene by scene, but they always add a little sentimental note by having the titular bad guy (Marlon, aka Little Man)) go through a true character arc. He is a little one note with his exaggerated facial expressions, but this is a Bugs bunny world.There are surprise cameos by well known comedic actors who also do these types of movie, but don't receive the same harsh criticisms the Wayan's get. One never hears of non-white people bagging on Adam Sandler et al, because they don't like the plot of a film, but nearly all films made by black actors are techno-lynched without being viewed. And the votes are skewered beyond belief. But I digress.\"Little Man\" is a movie you see for the same reason one goes to see silly comedies. Cheap laughs, silly sight gags, and free air conditioning. I give it a 7-10 because I know it will get slammed on here, but the fact is, they will make a lot of money off the DVD. \"White Chicks\" made ahem....$117 million. Prepare to see more from the Wayans with that kinda dough rolling in.",

Pursed by the police he hides the diamond in the handbag of a passing couple and makes his getaway. He needs to retrieve the diamond in a way that doesn't attract attention \u0096 so force is out. Luckily he overhears Darryl and Vanessa discussing having a baby together and spots his way in. Disguising himself as a baby, Calvin abandons himself on their doorstep and is taken into their house. The perfect cover and total access, what could possibly happen other than the conclusion of a perfect crime and, of course, hilarity?There's no point getting upset about it, the Wayans brothers have not only made films but will continue to get money to make more. It doesn't seem to matter how good or bad these films are, they will still get more money. I never bothered to see White Chicks but I didn't think they could have a worse idea \u0096 until that is, I saw the detail of this film. The plot is nonsense but that goes without saying. A bad story from the Wayans family is something I have come to expect but I did not expect just how tasteless so much of the content would be. This is a film that not only delivers the expected bodily function and physical pratfalls but also has time for rape and sexual harassment as subjects for the audience to supposedly be rolling with laughter about. To be honest though, if I had been laughing at these things then I would not be phrasing it like that, but the problem was that I laughed literally twice in the entire film. Both of these laughs were when one character repeatedly gets hit in the crotch and they were more of pleasure of even having a small moment of humour rather than the gag being good.The dearth of laughs mean that the plot is exposed all the more for the hideous creation it is. I was shocked to see the writers trying to produce an emotional core or theme to the proceedings \u0096 an attempt that fails badly. Not only did the material make me a little queasy but the poor effects did as well. Marlon Wayans constantly looks really badly superimposed and animated and the motions of body/head made me a little seasick. His performance is not much better but to be honest how can one judge the performance of actors in this film? It is easier just to make sure they are reminded that they did it as often as possible. Washington is better than this, much better. Shawn Wayans deserves it and Witherspoon at least has made a career out of this sort of performance and just ticks the boxes off. Palminteri must have needed a new car urgently, otherwise I have no idea what else would have made him take this work.Little Man is bad across the board and I can genuinely find nothing to recommend it for. I watched Norbit a few days ago and at least I had the make-up to praise, but with Little Man it is literally a creative, comedic and narrative void. I hope everyone involved can look past the money they made (and believe it or not, it did make money) and consider the implications of what they have done.",

In fact if I didn't know better I would think that the producer borrowed every bit of the Thin Man character development to give depth and meaning to the protagonist who would have otherwise never have garnished an emotional attachment from the audience.The affectation the protagonist garners on his would be adopted son is one of the most profound, touching moments in cinematic history. The see-saw of emotions continues when the criminal's partner arrives on the scene quite unexpectedly.Throughout the movie one gets a sense that the antagonist is speaking directly to us. In fact is this appeal that brings a richly deserved praise to the otherwise empty plot.Of course all love is lost on the antagonist when the two felons rob a jewelry store together and then proceed to take advantage of the sweet parents.The humor weaves its way in and out like so many gadflies on a pile of dung. It is this humor that allows the audience to identify more with the vertically challenged negro than the supposed good guy (Shawn Wayans) who gives a surprising rendition of a concerned Dad; the likes of which have not been seen since Ward Cleaver's in depth discussion of puberty to his sons.The movie capaciously deserves 10 stars but in retrospect the Fictional Reviewer gives it 3 stars for the unnecessary adulation of vertically challenged black people.",

I've just got back from the cinema, where I saw the film, and I've got to admit it was an enjoyable film.I don't know why, though. Most of the humour in this film revolves around slapstick violence, which is in itself mainly based around the fact that one of the instigators of the violence is tiny. This sounds horrible, I know it does, but it is actually not that bad (barring a few parts).This film does, for example, have the only *good* \"repeatedly being hit in the balls\" gag I've seen. Ever. Lots of movies try it, but this one does it well, even though it's fairly obvious what's going to happen.This film also has some of the most annoying performances I've seen. Ever. I have no idea what John Witherspoon was on during the filming of this, but I have the feeling it'd put half of Holland to sleep. I realise the character he's playing is supposed to be a bit crazy, but I quite honestly felt like throwing my shoe through the screen whenever he was on it. Kerry Washington also annoyed me at some points, but that was mostly due to her character's lines rather than how she delivered them.Shawn Wayans puts on a surprisingly (for me, at least) good performance. He's believable, you like him, and he plays the whole thing very well (whereas I've already mentioned that some of the actors seem to think they're rehearsing a wedding or something, rather than making a movie).The actual plot (a stolen diamond) is pretty much forgotten throughout most of the film. Once Marlon pretends to be the baby, until the very end of the movie, the diamond is pretty much a useless part of the plot (other than it's involved in a very annoying fart / crap joke, as well as a fairly amusing scene in which a group of mothers beat up a guy). But with this kind of comedy, you know you're not going to get much of a plot-heavy movie anyway, and that should be taken into consideration.All in all, this is a decent film. It's not perfect, but I honestly have no idea why it's in the bottom 100. It's honestly not that bad. But if you don't like slapstick involving midgets, this film really isn't for you.",

I was still curious and wanted to give the movie a fair chance, but it was a pain to sit through. I fell asleep twice, cut it off once after 30 minutes, and finally suffered through the entire movie on my fourth attempt.From the early previews and trailer, I instantly recognized the movie's concept was a rip-off of the \"baby Finster\" character from Bugs Bunny. And I'm sure this is where they got the idea, but will not admit it. By the way - speaking of previews, this is why I knew \"White Chicks\" would be bad, and didn't bother seeing it. The make-up was horrible!Anyway, the the script and acting is bad, and there were only two or three funny moments for me. It was irritating watching Kerry Washinton trying to sound/act white. And how come Hollywood has overlooked Brittany Daniel? I liked her body better in \"Joe Dirt\", before the implants! However, I do like Marlon because he has shown his potential and talents when given a decent role. It may be harsh criticism, but doing roles with his brother Shawn really hurts his chances and makes him look bad. Shawn's acting has always come across as stiff and non believable. Of course this is my opinion, but I think Marlon and Damon are the only Wayans that have demonstrated -watchable- acting talents (outside of \"In Living Color\".) (Aside from the Color\".",

            "content": "Following on from the critically panned White Chicks, which I admit I did find relatively funny in parts, this was the next supposedly terrible film from the Wayans brothers, from Razzie nominated director Keenan Ivory Wayans (Scary Movie). Basically dwarf criminal Calvin (Razzie winning Marlon Wayans) has been released from prison, but with the help of his idiotic brother Percy (30 Rock's Tracy Morgan) they plan their next robbery very quickly. With his height being the advantage, the short crook manages to sneak under a diamond case in a jewellery store and cut out the priceless gem, and the plan is to hand it over to mobster Walken (Analyze This's Chazz Palminteri). But when the robbery has its little snag, Calvin hides the diamond in the purse of passer-by Vanessa Edwards (Kerry Washington) who with her husband Darryl (Razzie winning Shawn Wayans) are discussing the wish to have children. So Percy convinces his brother to shave his beard off and cress like a baby to pose as an abandoned child left on the doorstep and get into the house and retrieve the diamond. Obviously this is not easy as Calvin cannot seem to get a free moment to get it back and escape, with the \"parents\" being so connected to their new arrival. Darryl and Kerry notice small oddities with their \"baby\", such as tattoos and a smoker's health problems, pointed out by the doctor, but they cannot get child/social services involved for a couple of days, so they keep him in the meantime. As Calvin tries to convince them he is a genuine baby, and obviously steal the diamond and get out of the situation, the couple think of adopting him, the old man Pops (John Witherspoon) is overly suspicious he is not a real baby, and Walken is getting impatient with Percy. After numerous mishaps, gross moments and subtle disasters, Darryl does eventually realise that he and Vanessa have indeed been fooled by Calvin into thinking he is a baby, and they obviously find the diamond. In the end, after all the confessions have been brought to the surface, and Walken ends up being arrested, Calvin seems to have nowhere to go, and with no family of his own he is obviously sad to be leaving, but Darryl forgives him and they become friends, and the parents have their own real child. Also starring Scary Movie's Lochlyn Munro as Greg, Molly Shannon as Soccer Mom, Brittany Daniel as Brittany, Family Guy's Alex Borstein as Janet, Anastacia and twice Razzie nominated Rob Schneider as Dinosaur Rex. After watching it, I can see how this film was in a way inspired by the Bugs Bunny cartoon \"Baby Buggy Bunny\", but anyway, the Wayans brothers together are terrible on screen here, the story has too many obvious attempts at awful humour, and no okay special effects can save it, I might have murmured a laugh, but it is an atrocious comedy. It won the Razzie for Worst Remake or Rip-Off and Worst Screen Couple for Shawn Wayans and either Kerry Washington or Marlon Wayans, and it was nominated for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay.

Believing that the foster parents accept the 'baby' as a baby is beyond belief... As other have commented, the crotch related 'humour' is tiresome and infantile. It was not funny or humorous: it was simply poorly scripted and shallow. You will not see any awards or nominations for this movie, plot, actors or otherwise. It is immediately forgettable (except it is so bad) and that is the way it should remain.Somehow this movie made it on to Saturday night prime-time TV where I live: a sad indictment indeed of Peth, Western Australia's free-to-air TV programming efforts.

It deals with Calvin (Marlon), a midget thief being released from prison only to steal a diamond. By accident, he lands it in the hands of goodhearted people wanting a child, Darryl (Shawn) and Vanessa (Kerry Washington). To fool them into taking him in, his friend (played horribly by Tracey Morgan) dresses him up like a baby. The acting in this is pathetic, especially by Shawn Wayans, who gave one of the worst performances I've ever experienced. The only actual actor in this was Chazz Palmenteri, who played a very unbelievable gangster, due to horrid writing. I chuckled a few times during the film, but it was mostly because of how bad the acting and writing was. Several people show up in cameos, including Rob Schnieder. He recently said he'd never work with Mel Gibson, yet he'd work in this in a dinosaur suit? Whatever. I hated this movie and so will you.My rating: 1/2 out of ****.

Little Man had his script written by director Keenen himself and his brothers Marlon and Shawn Wayans, who starred in the film.Calvin Sims is a dangerous jewel thief who is not even a meter tall. Fresh out of prison, he decides to carry out one last major robbery before retiring. The chosen target is the famous Queen diamond, for which Calvin and his partner Percy will receive $ 100,000. The assault goes awry and Calvin hides the diamond in Vanessa Edwards' purse, which takes him home without noticing the extra baggage. Calvin and Percy follow her and witness an argument that Vanessa has with her husband Darryl. He wants to be a father as soon as possible, but Vanessa thinks having a child can hinder his career as vice president of an advertising agency. Taking advantage of the cue, Calvin and Percy devise a plan: posing as a baby, Calvin would be left at the door of the Edwards' house. They, enchanted, would take him inside the house, where the thief could steal the diamond. The plan works, but Calvin didn't expect his baby life to be much more complicated than he imagined.I have already reviewed this film several times and saw it again because today I wanted to see it!

            "content": "Little Man is one of the most beautifully acted films that I have seen in recent years. The Performances by Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans are spectacular. While Kerry Washington plays the stand out role of a mother/wife, who has slowly and methodically grown distant and quite mad over the years of their marriage, I believe that Shawn's performance is just as impressive and equally mad. In dealing with a wife who is as immature as his own children, Shawn is reduced to dealing with her in extreme and embarrassing ways.The tension begins when Darryl, played by Shawn Wayans brings his co-workers back to his house in the morning after a long night shift, which probably was not the smartest idea because he had broken a long standing date with his wife the previous night. I suppose he brought them back for his own protection, thinking that maybe the presence of other might help to suppress an incident with his wife. Her bazaar awkward interactions build until Darryl has to yell at Vanessa (Washington). From there it only gets worse. Vanessa's fickle and fragile mental state makes for a strange situation for her children. After practically kicking them out of the house in the morning, a few minutes later, she is begging for their presence once again. She waits in frantic anticipation for the bus to arrive and collects her children at the foot of the bus like a mother has not seen her kids for years. The way in which she acts towards the father of her children's play date is that of a twelve year old. The father does not seem comfortable at with leaving his children with a woman who he thought to be drunk, but later finds out just to be mad. After he tells her so, her demeanor immediately changes once again and she has a look of shame, like a child who has just been scorned by a disappointed parent. Darryl arrives in a fit of rage that seems a bit over the top. He strikes her and it is in this scene that one realizes the exhausting effects that his wife's strange behavior has on him. It drives him to lash out and act in equally irrational ways. His patience is constantly being tested.This is a common theme throughout the movie. It seems that every family member seems to have the right idea of how to fix this family and is not afraid to voice their opinion. Darryl's mother is one such character. One of the final scenes is when the family is gathered around the dinner table after Vanessa's return from the hospital. Darryl's mother and other family members refuse to accept Vanessa's request to be alone with her immediate family thinking that the best thing for her is to have people around. This ends badly and Vanessa is almost forced into a type of relapse. Darryl is constantly trying to keep a dictatorial control over his family no matter what the cost - understandably so, as he has been pushed to this point psychologically and physically as he strikes Vanessa into sanity once again.The movie is a strange demonstration of family life. I think it's extremes are meant to display that all families have their problems and deal with them under their own circumstances. Is it right for others to intervene? Who makes that decision? The voyeuristic quality in which the film was shot also incites a feeling of guilt in the audience for witnessing such atrocities and also instills a feeling that they are a present member of the family and a first hand witness to the troubles that they are experiencing. The movie was enrapturing from beginning to end.",

For example, i watched re-runs of fresh prince for 5 or even more times, and i knew what he will say, and still when he did it, it was excellent! Same goes here, i loved the jokes, they were awesome, and to have such a low rating, something has to be wrong with all those 5.000 people, either they are without sense of humor, or didn't even watch the movie!! And when people say that \"Little man\" had very few laughs and the jokes were stale, i don't see how that is possible? Like i said before, maybe the jokes were just to hard for some people to understand. I was watching this movie with more then 10 friends, and we were laughing the whole time,and no, we were not high, because none of us smoke!",

Then after climbing inside Rob's suit Calvin bites Rob Schneider presumably in the crotch. And at the end he hits all three of the criminals in the crotch at least once. I mean it gets old and just isn't funny at all. This film's script really isn't all that good either I mean seriously Calvin is a bad guy that deserved to get sent back to jail.

The so-called \"jokes\" in this film bring a cringe to the face, they are mostly comprised of people taking hits to the face and balls, the baby looking weird and acting like a horny gangsta and the typical race jokes we see so often in todays garbage comedies. The film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe but also predictable and dull. The characters are extremely annoying and heavily stereotyped.

            "content": "It has nice idea and bold visual adventure, with mostly an annoying outcome. So let's review why that happened.Filth, filth, and filth. I don't know what's remotely funny about tasting a dog's urine, or rubbing a cookie up a butt then eating it. The thing is the Wayans brothers love such a sense of humor. And I became sure that they know nothing about making comedy but it. Look at the movie; it's all about the butt, the penis, the nuts. How many time the nuts of someone got hit in here? No. The real question is: Didn't they get board with repeating it?! I was sick not due to seeing many jokes of that sort only, but to not seeing anything else them too!Then, the incredibly ugly performance of (Shawn Wayans). Please, quit acting pal. It's for your sake and ours. Since you have no charisma, ability of acting, or an atom of comedy. OH MY GOD, this guy is A-one failure who doesn't change. He has the perfect specifics for a Razzie, rather the ones the Razzie was modeled for! (He worthily won it for that year). The second worst actor goes to (David Alan Grier) as the singer. That was designed to be bad in a funny way; however it ended up as bad and unfunny in no way!Then, the script. For most of the time, it goes nowhere. Scene like the one in the stadium seems written after the movie was over. And if I talked about the mistakes, then I would write a book. Just remember: The little man talks to the kids, trying to sell them naked photos, or hits the actor in the dinosaur costumes, etc. And nobody ever tells the parents about it?! The diamond is bigger than the little man's mouth though he swallows it?! The police come to the house to see the so-called baby holding a gun, threatening the bad guys AND DON'T SUSPECT A THING?!! The husband demands from the little man, at the last minute, to lower his voice while talking about strippers so his wife doesn't hear; the so wide-awake writers, directors, and actors of the movie forgot totally that the wife wasn't even there, since she ran after her father short time earlier. That, as a whole, whether shows the movie-makers as stupid, or their assumption of us as stupid!Yet, on a deeper level, the naivety is maybe more powerful. I mean that grandpa waited so long to tell the police about that fugitive that they have at home. Instead, he bought a secret camera? (a new definition of FORCED!). The wife couldn't tell who slept with her?, especially when it's a midget!!, too much of course. And when they left a room for that criminal at last, I felt something wrong; the guy slept with the lead's wife you sane people!Faraway from that: Being based on a cartoon movie, Baby Buggy Bunny (1954), is a big challenge to undertake in the first place, I loved it apart. The visual effects were good, but not that good, because some shots looked so fake with lighting over (Marlon Wayans)'s face that obviously differs from the total lighting of any scene he's in. (Tracy Morgan) did a very good job despite the shortness of his role. (Kerry Washington) made the things believable and balanced with her rational performance. (Alex Borstein) was adorable too. The serious parts (the monologues that express the importance of being a parent, the devotion for it, or the feelings of the criminal towards the family that he accidentally wins) are somehow well-made, however delivered badly from (Shawn Wayans)' side. I liked the way how the boss thinks that the husband is involved in the crime which paves the way for final encounter between the leads and the gang, Ahhh.. lastly an evidence of intelligence!The scene of (Morgan) going to the boss (Chazz Palminteri) with a bag full of kid's stuff as the one with the diamond is the only wonderful comic moment here. And, surprisingly, it has nothing to do with filth. So, it is rare. Just why this movie wasn't made with many \"rare\" moments like this? At least it would have been not rude, and fit to be watched for more than once too.(Little Man) is like its little man; a funny criminal who goes into our houses with a lot of noise and a few laughs. So, eventually, it annoys more than gives a joy. In fact, the Wayans brothers make you thank God that movies aren't made with smell!",

Meanwhile, the woman's husband has been desperate to try to have a son, and when the little man posing as a baby arrives at his doorstep, he's more than happy to take a chance to prove to his wife that he can be a good father.This movie was certainly cleaner and more family friendly than White chicks, which was a masterpiece by the Wayan brothers, and it played the perfect moral that needs to be overdone...how to be a good father. it also wasn't Sex-saturated which was really nice. it had a fair amount of violence which was OK. However, it was unrealistic.For one, A Fiberglass Hockey stick won't break 1-inch thick plexiglass, and a plastic bat won't make a 7 foot tall guy bruise.But the bottom line is, this movie's worth a rental, or a buy. it's funny and it has some morals. it's tuned towards the teenage audience but kids will enjoy it too, as long as you explain some parts to them.7/10",

I haven't laughed so hard at a comedy in a long time...Some of the scenes were side splitting! Incredibly stupid, but thats whats good about the movie! Just chill out and go with it! Accept the movie for what it is...A dumb ass comedy with a simple plot! It seems that most of the people on this board are not open minded enough (and too stuck up) to accept this kind of humour! Just let your guard down and stop picking at the fact that it's far fetched and unrealistic! This is a very funny movie, and its obvious that a lot of hard work went into filming it. Marlon's scenes were filmed not only by him, but all over again by a child dwarf so they could get the effect of it perfectly. And it worked a treat! Marlon looks like a true dwarf.I would watch this movie again, and recommend it to anyone who doesn't take themselves too seriously.So yeah, I give this film a 7.5 out of 10",

We can see that Marlon Wayans is playing the joker role in this film. Certainly as long as he has been involved in the casting job, he has always been acting as a little man-an actor can change his customary dress but can hardly change his physical appearance-and the latter one can be an advantage when necessary. However far away from what I expected, I saw an image very disguising, pretending to expose different aspects of the baby life by mistake of a forty-year- old criminal. And with a ridiculous happy ending. So what is the point? Many elements are mixed up, some principal ones are violence, sex and criminal activities, amongst which the story is badly composed and to some extent, lack common sense: where is Vanessa when the peace of her house is violated and her husband's life being pursued? In addition the diamond is even bigger than the world's No.1 Cullinan! But the most sickening facet is the continuous attempt to make up the little man as a superman by showing his physical weak points. And they call it humour. A diamond is precious, hard and fragile; it cannot be cut by any other material but only be conquered by the hot blood of a male goat. Hence it's no more a diamond but pieces of debris.",

Imagine an adult orientated Home-Alone-Type comedy and you're somewhere near what this movie is offering.It features a midget (think mini-me) as a master jewel thief on his newest venture, complete with a ditsy accomplice and a tamer-than-your-average bad guy. With that in mind, it's easy to understand why this movie may seem as an offering for the kids, but it's absolutely not.The movie is packed with sex references, some strong. So who is this movie targeted at? I don't know, and I don't think the makers know either.The humour is slapstick (frying pans, blows to the privates) with, in most cases, a real lack of depth. On top of this, the more intelligent of movie goers will easily find themselves predicting what's about to happen next, with an alarming rate of accuracy.Next we move on to the plot. It's unrealistic and extremely far fetched \u0096 yet that alone could have easily been passable. Combined with the facts above, though, and it adds to the lack of thought and originality that is this movie. With a 60 million dollar production cost, it makes you wonder just where all that money actually went.Despite all the above, there are one or two (literally) brief moments where the movie is genuinely funny. Yet, by the end, the jokes have become repetitive and worn. You may well find yourself thankful that the movie didn't have a longer runtime.If slapstick comedy is your thing and a poor, predictable, plot is passable: This movie may well be for you. For everyone else, I'd advise this one to stay as a last-resort at your local rental store.-James Capu",

Surprisingly this one falls flat, but quick laughs get them past. A midget ex-convict (Marlon) is fleeing from the police after stealing a diamond and while in a store he places the diamond in a bag carried by a man and wife (Kerry Washington and Shawn Wayans). To get the diamond back, both the midget and his partner (Tracy Morgan) devise a plan that has him posing as a child and getting access into the family's home. After seeing films like Scary Movie and White Chicks, you kinda figure out the Wayans humor and go in expecting them to follow up. But instead the film is too tame and dull and is revived by quick scenes that get you to laugh. I was really disappointed with John Witherspoon's character because he didn't do the signature improvisational routines that he does in other movies. It just wasn't what I expected but I can't say that it wasn't worthwhile seeing the film, maybe I had too high of expectations but it wasn't really my cup of tea.

Also, there is a condition where people are really short, but have normal adult faces when they mature. A white person with such a condition might pull it off, because their faces allow it. Many white kids have adult heads and adult facial features, so their features almost cross over. The only thing would be that whoever you got would be an acting novice. Black adult faces have features that no black kid would have, so how could you trick someone into thinking that an adult was a child when that outcome of having everything line up as it does naturally in many whites would be like someone winning the lottery of world?! That's what made it all wrong! The problem was not really with the idea, but the applicative vision. It seems like to me that once the idea had been put out there, KIWayans should have been asking himself what scenarios allow this to be believable.

A con man whom is a midget gets released from prison and along with another idiot steels a diamond.

Darrell and Vanessa decide to keep him for the weekend since child services are closed. Then there are a lot of jokes about breast mild, rectal thermometers, baths, etc... Calvin starts to enjoy his time there since he never had a family. Of course,the mob guy who wants the diamond puts the squeeze on and finally a happy ending.FINAL VERDICT: I thought it was pretty good.

            "content": "America. A land of freedom, of hope and of dreams. This is the nation that, since its independence, has striven to bring democracy, prosperity, and peace to the entire world, for the good of all mankind. There are times, however, when one cannot help but wish that the American's would just stay on their side of the Atlantic. This 'movie' (and I use that word with some reservations) evokes these feelings with an intense purity. This vision of hell follows the adventures of Calvin, a freakish jewel thief who was created by attaching the severed head of Marlon Wayan onto the body of a two foot-high dwarf. After inadvertently dropping a large diamond into the handbag of Vanessa, a career-woman who is reluctant to have children, Calvin realises that in order to recover the diamond he must ingratiate himself with her. So, as any normal man would, Calvin dresses himself up as a 2 year-old and parks himself upon the poor woman's doorstep, where he is discovered by Darryl, the broody husband of Vanessa. Darryl incongruously falls for Calvin's disguise despite the fact that the 'baby' has a full set of teeth, stubble, a tattoo, a knife-scar, and the sex-drive of a 16-year-old. Even more absurdly, Vanessa doesn't see past Calvin's baby-wear either and actually attempts to breastfeed the diminutive pervert. This wretched assault upon the soul of mankind attempts, and fails, to find humour in rape, scatology, sexual assault, and paedophilia, however, in a dishonest attempt to transform itself into a piece of 'family-entertainment' the Wayan brothers stir in a sickening amount of sentiment and flawed morality. The brothers dim attempt a Freudian rehabilitation of their thieving rapist by revealing that he \"had a bad father\". Repeatedly hitting Darryl in the crotch enables Calvin to develop the loving father-son relationship that both he and Darryl have always wished for. As if this wasn't ridiculous enough, Calvin's attempts to sexually assault Vanessa somehow convince her that it is selfish for a woman to indulge herself with a successful career, and that instead she should spend her life playing the role of the housebound little-woman, who spends her time alternatively squeezing out babies and cooking for her husband. In this movie the Wayan brothers have mixed their crass and twisted form of humour together with the clich\u00e9d sentimentality that has infected much of Hollywood's recent body of work. Additionally, they are endemic of the current generation of black comedians who are responsible for transforming African-American humour into a poor and wretched shadow of itself that over-indulges in fart-jokes and crude sexual gags. By rights these two should be legally barred from picking up anything even remotely resembling a camera ever again. Unfortunately the current artistic and moral bankruptcy of American cinema means that by this time next month they will undoubtedly have filmed two sequels and be making millions of dollars from tacky merchandising deals.",

It seems as though I could laugh at a joke in this movie and then move on to the next scene satisfied with the last. In my opinion, White Chicks did not allow me to do this...and instead it tried to make me keep laughing at the same thing for a couple of minutes...and that did not work. The Wayans Brothers definitely are not back to their 'Scary Movie' form...but Little Man definitely showed signs of improvement.

It's not a typical movie that has been done hundreds of times. This movie is the only movie I've seen that has a storyline like Little Man.The comedy leaves some room for improvement.

Sure, what they were showing on the commercials didn't seem that funny, but, hey, it stars Shawn and Marlon, right? Well, I had a felling the movie would suck, and it did. My brother and I didn't laugh once, and we love the Wayans Brothers comedy. The movie was lame. But the 8 year old kids in the theater couldn't stop laughing.",

            "content": "Not everyone have the same comedy tastes. With most movie marketing nowadays, it's 50/50 whether or not the movie itself is worth your time and money to go see. That being said, this latest offering from Shawn and Marlon Wayans (with directing duties by oldest sibling, Keenan) met my expectations. It Made Me Laugh AND was worth it.Yes, some of the jokes go for broke with the simple visual \"lowbrow\" or \"groaner\" but, if it puts a smile on your face, then it's done it's job entertaining me.No, I wasn't expecting \"Oscar-Caliber acting\", but I know that given the talent of the Wayans brothers, along with the supporting cast of Tracy Morgan, John Witherspoon and several other talented comedy-actors and actresses (look for cameos by former \"In Living Color\" AND \"Saturday Night Live\" Alumni as well), I was thoroughly entertained and dare I say? \"Laughing at one point with tears in my eyes!\"Also, from a \"technological\" stand point: I applaud Marlon Wayans for acting \"with only his face\" and the actors who \"performed\" as his \"body\" and the near-seamless combination to make them appear \"as one\", as the pint-sized ex-felon.In these times of wars, high gas prices and a stumbling economy, I salute the Wayans' for at least doing something to put a smile on my face in these challenging times and my rating reflects that.It ain't \"Rocket Science\"... It's simple \"Summer Movie Escapism\". Have a laugh. (We ALL can benefit from it).",

As i sat watching the movie these two white men in suits keep laughing and laughing I said to myself this movie must be funny. The previews don't do the movie any justice, it made the movie seem very corny and I thought it would have be another lame movie. I'm not trying to say go see the movie to support our black people, I'm just saying go see it because it is funny I have laugh like that since Martin.

On the run from the cops, he stashes it into a woman's bag without her knowing. When he hears that she and her husband (Shawn Wayans) are expecting a baby, he disguises himself as one in order to sneak in and get the diamond back. Brilliant idea!!! It has a lot of comedy and visual effects, which you don't normally see together in one film. Also when Calvin makes \"babbling noises\" such as, \"Goo-goo gaa-gaa\", that's really funny too.

            "content": "\"Little Man\", now on DVD, is a Wayans Brothers flop. It's the tale of a smaller than a midget criminal played by Marlon Wayans, who hides a diamond in a lady's purse after a heist. He and his partner Tracy Morgan cook up the genius plan to disguise Marlon as a baby and plant him at the lady's home. He then goes through all sorts of \"Home Alone\" or \"Child's Play\" like mayhem to get the jewel back and be treated like a baby. I was surprised by how low the humor was in this film. The jokes have been done in other places so many times, that they aren't cute or funny. I almost think the movie might have been funnier if they didn't use CGI and used the small actor who Marlon's face was pasted over. In watching the deleted scenes (minus CGI) this actor was funny in a Mini-me like way, but they chose a different route. A few cameos and Tracy Morgan make some funny scenes..Spend your rental fee $ on Borat if you want some real laughs these days.http://mcmusicnotes.blogspot.com",

The Wayans brothers did it again, this is the funniest movie of the summer, but be care full this is an adult comedy leave small children with the nanny and enjoy a good comedy. The movie has a great cast of actors such as Molly Shannon the small part that she played was hilarious, John Witherspoon funny as always, also appears in the movie Rob Schneider. Watch out for Tracy Morgan he is good comedian I compare him to the late Richard Pryor.",

I watched the first 20-30 minutes of the film and could not take it. The jokes were recycled and felt like they had been done before (many times). Pretty unfunny in general and boring, almost as bad as Scary movie 4 (Which would take a lot to beat).The main concern I have with Little man is the obvious computer generated graphics, it's bad when seen in small doses in other films but this goes beyond... it's constant and screams out whenever you see Marlon Wayans, every movement he makes is jerky and blurry and made me cringe.This film had way too much promotion when it was released, and surprised me that it was shown at cinemas. All this said the DVD would make a great mirror or frisbee... But by all means do not buy it as a gift, no matter how tempting the bargain bin may be.",

I've never been so offended or insulted by the existence of a movie as I have this piece of vomit inducing rubbish.",

The jokes consist mostly of crotch shots, lame sex jokes (including a scene where \"Calvin\" pretends to be \"Vanessa's\" husband during the middle of the night so they can have sex, which is rape, not a joke) and characters looking bug eyed as a little man that is supposed to pass off as a small child does inappropriate things.
