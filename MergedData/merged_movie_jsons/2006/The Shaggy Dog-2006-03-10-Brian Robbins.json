            "content": "I took my 12 year old grandson to see it and he was rolling on the floor for most of the film. I was surprised that it was actually funny,much more surprise than I was prepared for. This is a funny movie for those preteens and early teens as they seem to really enjoy it. Sure it is not full of high tech special effects and should never be compared to the Matrix, but it is a Disney! movie --- get it... a Disney movie. Take that into consideration ... how many Disney movies achieve high ratings anyway, other than the classics? This is a fun movie. I saw the original and it was funny too. Remember way back when everything was black and white and not color? The special effects in this movie are not very high tech and some of the metamorphosis takes place when you do not see it, so do not expect \"the wolf-man\" changes to be shown, nope, one shot he is a man, the next he is a dog. Some of the other critters are pretty funny too and kids seem to love this movie.",

Had three kids with me...14 yr old 8 yr old and 6yr old who all sat watching it, enjoying it and laughing away. Me too. Tim Allen was great as usual and def suits the comedy side of acting. Bit samey with the oldest child a teenage daughter who wears different clothes and wants to be rebellious...father works a lot and isn't the most committed father..mother who seems to do it all and has had enough and then the younger son who just seems to want to do his own thing but hasn't the nerve to say it. BUT apart from that the dog was great, Tim Allen and Robery Downey Jnr were great(nice to see Downey in something), some funny scenes with the actors and with the animals. Bit slow to start with but gets better. Def entertaining for kids and adults..if only Disney done more like this, seem to have dome some fantastic films years ago and then lost the plot a bit. Worth seeing",

This is what we've come to expect from Disney, good clean family fun. Tim Allen plays his familiar role as the preoccupied but hilarious comedian, an Assistant DA (ADA) prosecuting a case against an animal rights activist who was caught damaging a research lab. The lab is performing illegal experiments of which the ADA becomes a part. I didn't notice any slow spots, it was nonstop action and humor as Allen deals with his job, marriage, and family while trying to understand and cope with his hairy predicaments.

            "content": "In this 21st century update of the 1959 Disney classic (and its 1976 sequel, \"The Shaggy D.A.\"), Tim Allen is cast as Dave Douglas, a deputy district attorney who ends up being bitten by a mystical Tibetan canine who is supposedly hundreds of years old. Of course, he will then start transforming into a dog himself - at the worst possible times, naturally. He'll have to do some serious adjusting to these developments as he discovers some truths about the case he is currently trying, and deals with a nefarious geneticist (Robert Downey, Jr.).Usually derided by adult viewers, who understandably are miffed by some mis-use of acting talent, \"The Shaggy Dog\" '06 is really not that bad. This viewer would be lying if he said that he didn't burst out laughing at some of the expected gags where Allen is committing to canine behaviour while still in human form. The transformations are almost entirely done off screen, with cuts made between Allen and his canine version.Since this IS a Disney feature we're talking about, it should come as no surprise that it does get sentimental, and ultimately workaholic / absentee dad Dave will become a better man, and become closer to his children, through his off the wall experience.Allen is definitely fun, and the supporting cast serves him well: Danny Glover, Philip Baker Hall, Kristin Davis, Spencer Breslin and Zena Grey as the kids. Jane Curtin is admittedly under utilized in a very straight role as the judge presiding over the trial. But this viewer will be honest, the main reason that \"The Shaggy Dog\" '06 hits him in a soft spot is because the dog in the movie is a bearded collie (or beardie). This may offend some purists, since the dog in the original movies was an Olde English Sheepdog, but I love beardies; our family had one for fourteen years and she was a wonderful pet. And Cole, the beardie utilized here, is adorable and obviously extremely well trained. Young viewers may take to some of the other endearing animal characters, as well.While inevitably formulaic and predictable, this movie generates enough decent laughs to make it okay entertainment.Six out of 10.",

But he's clever about it, and the slapstick in this remake rivals the pioneering skill of silent film comedians. This is Allen's best work since \"Galaxy Quest.\"The ultimate test of this movie is the child you take along (including the one we carry in our heart). My daughter laughed and had a great time. She even explained the DNA cloning technology in such a way that demonstrated just how much craft when into the screenplay -- \"make it understandable to a kid under 12\" -- even though the pseudo science of the plot often distracted my adult mind.I never saw the original flick with Fred MacMurray. But I did see Lon Chaney play The Wolfman, and a dozen other werewolf movies. This is a G-rated version of the same mythology, and it resonates for me as an adult, but flies over the head of my youngster. \"The Shaggy Dog\" works on two distinct levels while satisfying both audiences -- I only wish all family movies were this good.",

            "content": "Assistant D.A. David Douglas (Allen) finds himself barking up the wrong tree, after he's bitten by a dog being experimented on in a laboratory and suddenly finds himself acting and the turning into a dog himself.Tim Allen's film career is a case of hit or miss. The Santa Clause movies are offset by Joe Somebody and Christmas with the Kranks. Unfortunately, The Shaggy Dog is in the latter group. To be blunt, the film is pretty bad. The movie was not funny and it was quite dull. I know it's just a harmless family film but did it have to be so boring and humorless? Of course it didn't. I always thought family movies were supposed to entertain the entire family not just one age group of the family. The Shaggy Dog may prove to be an enjoyable treat for the kids but most people over the age of 13 will probably hate it.The acting is only okay and the decent cast keeps the film from completely sinking. Tim Allen gives a decent performance as Dave but he really needs to stop doing lame family movies. Kristin Davis also gives a decent performance and she is also way above this material. I really don't like Spencer Breslin. He just annoys me and his acting isn't very good. The Shaggy Dog did not change my opinion about him. Zena Grey just gives a bland performance, nothing special from her. Robert Downey Jr. gives a decent performance as the bad guy. Danny Glover is wasted in his role and he barely appears on screen.The first twenty minutes or so are actually pretty enjoyable. After that, the movie starts reusing the same jokes and it becomes more serious. There was probably a break from the laughter for about 30 minutes since the movie was handling serious issues in a lighthearted way. I think the director did this to attract both adults and children but he ended up alienating both of them. The stupid humor will probably bore adults and the serious scenes will probably bore the children. I have never seen the original Shaggy Dog movies and maybe that's how those films were handled as well. However, the film seemed a little misdirected to me which isn't surprising since there are five(!) credited screenwriters. Behind the camera, it seems like things were a little messy and it shows in the movie. In the end, The Shaggy Dog is a harmless yet humorless family film that should appeal to the kids. Everyone else should skip the movie. Rating 3/10",

            "content": "(Synopsis) Dr. Kozak (Robert Downey Jr.) kidnaps a 300-year old Tibetan sheepdog in an attempt to discover the dog's secret of longevity and produce a fountain of youth drug. Unfortunately, all he has produced are animal mutations such as a king cobra-canine with a tail, a dog-frog that barks, and other mutations that are part dog. The sheepdog escapes the lab and is rescued by Carly Douglas (Zena Grey), who takes him home. Deputy District Attorney Dave Douglas (Tim Allen) is prosecuting Carly's teacher for the firebombing of Dr. Kozak's lab. Dave hates dogs, and after he is bitten by the sheepdog, the dog is sent to the pound. The dog has injected Dave with some of his DNA cells, and Dave begins to have canine urges and eventually, becomes a sheepdog. Dave learns the truth about his family and the drug company as a dog.(My Comment) This is a cute movie that you can take your children to. There are several funny scenes like the bathroom and park scenes that are just hilarious. I think they wasted their money on the CG effects on the cat chasing scene. If you look at the Shaggy Dog poster, you will see Tim Allen's eerie eyes. I enjoyed this movie, and you must remember that this is only a movie, and don't take the plot too seriously.

            "content": "You want to know how disgustingly, morbidly PC Disney has become? They put trousers on a monkey because they are afraid to show naked animals in case parents are offended. Can you believe that? What is this world coming to? Walt would be spinning in his grave if he were not cryogenically frozen.Tim Allen plays Dave Douglas, a bad dad who neglects his wife and kids and does way too much overtime. He's a lawyer you see and his current big case involves an animal research company who make poodles into frogs or something like that. Their goal is to make the elixir of everlasting life so naturally one would make a poodle into a frog to achieve such a noble ambition.Dave is bit by one of the dogs and now is infected with dogness. This causes him to periodically turn into a dog and 'hilarity' ensues as he tries to keep up his case and maintain his family life. Why on earth would you want to see this? Tim Allen has already played a neglectful dad who learns important lessons after undergoing a weird metamorphosis in 2 Santa Clause movies so he's not broadening his role much. And how many movies are there with bad dads (always the dad and never the mum, eh?) who are usually lawyers who learn the same crap? About 86 billion!I can understand why Tim Allen is in this as he is constantly scraping the bottom of the sludge barrel but how the hell did they get Robert Downey Jnr, Danny Glover AND Philip Baker Hall do to this? They must owe their bookmakers a fair whack. No one in their right mind could read this script and find it worthy of their talents.So not only does the story stink of the worst clich\u00e9s but it's woefully misjudged and badly directed. The scene where Mrs. Douglas confronts her dog husband and hears him bark 'I wuff woo' is pretty much the most disturbing scene I've ever come across. And I've watched snuff. When they look into each others eyes I seriously thought she'd start making out with him.And when the film finishes...is Dave still going to turn into a dog? Is he cured? Who knows? Do I really care that much? Why? Why do I do this myself? If you really hate life then see this movie. If you are of sound body and mind then save the pennies for guns, drugs and ill hookers. It's money better spent. Trust me!",

He gets a hold of a magic \"Borgia ring\" and switches from being a sheep-dog to a man. This remake is the same except they took out the magic ring part and replaced it with a thousand-year-old \"magic\" Buddhist dog who bites the lawyer. Tim Allen as Dave Douglas is doing his usual comedic performing style and does a fine job at it. He's a dead-beat dad who learns to love his kids and become a better father by listening to his children as a dog. Kristin Davis is his wife Rebecca. Better known for her role in Sex In The City, she's proving to be a versatile actress. Zena Grey and Spencer Breslin play the kids and they're good in this also.

            "content": "I'll admit right off the bat that I am a fan of Tim Allen. I never really watched his television show \"Home Improvement\" but really liked him in films like \"Galaxy Quest\", \"Big Trouble\", and \"The Santa Clause\". But when I saw the trailer for \"The Shaggy Dog\" I shook my head with disbelief. How could Tim Allen do such a stupid movie? I asked myself. But I figured I would give the film a shot because sometimes the marketing is very misleading and the actual film itself could be decent. So tonight, I ventured to my local cinema to catch the 8:00pm showing of \"The Shaggy Dog\".\"The Shaggy Dog\" is about a man named Dave Douglas (Tim Allen) who works for a big law firm in Los Angeles. Dave is a man that is so caught up with his work that he doesn't even realize he is ignoring his wife Rebecca (Kristen Davis) and his two kids Carly (Zena Grey) and Josh (Spencer Breslin). Dave is currently working on the biggest case of his career which involves animal testing. If Dave wins this case, he will become the head D.A. at the firm. But when a dog from the testing facility escapes and comes to the Douglas house. This is where Dave's priorities begin to change as Dave turns into a dog and sees his family and himself from a totally new and unique perspective.I'll be really honest with my review here and state that \"The Shaggy Dog\" isn't a great movie by any means. The story is silly and the film reminded me at times of the Rob Schneider film \"The Animal\" but is \"The Shaggy Dog\" as bad as the trailers lead you to believe? Not really. The movie had good intentions but was just poorly executed. The movie really is a feel good family flick but it isn't very original nor is it very believable.What \"The Shaggy Dog\" does well is it delivers a good message which is \"Be there for your family\". What makes \"The Shaggy Dog\" fail is the fact that the film is so incredibly silly. I think the writers of this film tried so hard to make the film childish that it caused the film to be overly stupid at parts. The whole scene where Tim Allen chases the cat like a dog is really too much and wasn't necessary. I feel if the film took itself a little more seriously instead of trying to be constantly funny, the final product would have been much better.But that's not saying that the film is a total disaster like I thought it would be when I walked into it earlier today. It was a decent family film and kids under 10 will probably adore it but parents will probably beg for it to become a little less goofy. The movie itself was a decent, silly film that could have been executed better but instead turned into a very average family film.Tim Allen actually does a decent job here although as I mentioned before not as good as he could have done. This is probably my 2nd least favorite film of his, the first being \"Jungle to Jungle\" which was also made by Disney. His performance was just a little too over the top here and it seemed like he was trying too hard to be funny. The family members on the other hand did a good job. I liked the roles that Kristen Davis, Zena Grey, and Spencer Breslin played and I felt that they all did a pretty good job. Also Robert Downey Jr. wasn't bad either as the evil mastermind. Overall the cast was a lot better than the actual film.Brian Robbins was the director of this film and I feel that this is where the problem with the film lies. A director has total control of the film and I think Brain Robbins still doesn't have a good director touch yet. Robbins has brought us several bad movies including \"Good Burger\", \"Ready to Rumble\" and the absolutely dreadful \"The Perfect Score\". So looking at his previous experience I can see why \"The Shaggy Dog\" wasn't an excellent movie. The problem here is that he isn't that good of a director and that's why this film wasn't exactly good. I would think that he would have caught on by now but he is still missing the bar on what it takes to direct a good movie.In the end, I didn't hate \"The Shaggy Dog\" like I thought I would have. It's a passable family film that kids under the age of 10 will probably love. Being a fan of not only Tim Allen but family films in general, I was disappointed with the outcome of this movie. It had some redeeming elements to it but not enough to save the lame script and the poor directing. If the movie didn't try so hard to be funny, it probably could have been funnier. I wouldn't recommend this movie as a full price ticket at the local cinema but it's an OK matin\u00e9e or DVD rental.MovieManMenzel's final rating for \"The Shaggy Dog\" is a 6/10. If you have young ones, take them because they will love it even if you feel it's a bit too much at times.",

His kids know that he doesn't get them, and his wife is starting to realize that she is losing her husband to his job. When the 300 year old shaggy dog escapes the test lab and bites Douglas,he transforms into a dog at night, and has many dog-like tendencies throughout the day.Often, jokes are repeated throughout the movie, yet don't receive a \"running-joke\" label, but become annoying.

I avoided seeing this film in the theater and thought that it was okay to see it at the drive-in as you see 2 movies for the price of 1. It was better than the second feature actually. The film gives a dog's point of view on life. Tim Allen is silly enough to make the role believable. The chasing of the tail, frisbees and the shaking of the head to remove water was portrayed perfectly. Shaggy Dog kept the viewer interested with what was going to happen next. The film is a family movie that everyone will like. I wondered why they used a sheep dog? There are many other types that could of been utilized. 7 out of 10. Worth seeing!",

            "content": "The Shaggy Dog is a very sprightly and spirited family comedy, that does rely on a lot of slapstick. As daft as it often is, it is endearing and funny, with a truly hilarious performance from Tim Allen as Dave Douglas, a pooch hating lawyer who is bitten by a dog and turns into one. There are a lot of chuckles to be had, particularly Dave's new habits and also when he chases a cat on all fours. But the highlight is the ending, which is wonderfully wacky, thanks to a great pantomimic turn from Robert Downey Jnr as the villain of the piece, especially when he goes literally barking mad. The film is also compensated by a nice soundtrack, a witty screenplay and some truly inspired moments of physical comedy.In fact, in my personal opinion, the only things wrong with this film was the perhaps too leisurely direction and the slushy family values moralising. All in all, a very funny and underrated family comedy. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "\"The Shaggy Dog\" had to be at least mildly amusing. Earlier collaborations between comedian Tim Allen and Disney, including \"The Santa Clause\" and \"Jungle 2 Jungle\" were always hilarious. Sticking Tim Allen into a tried-and-true storyline, the oft remade \"The Shaggy Dog\" was a safe bet on Disney's part. This isn't Tim Allen's funniest movie and this isn't the most vibrant remake of \"The Shaggy Dog\", but it does manage to be at least mildly amusing all the way through, and at times it's even hilarious.Tim Allen plays a deputy D. A. prosecuting an animal rights activist accused of torching a laboratory in which cruel experiments were allegedly performed on animals. What Allen's character doesn't realize is that a villainous scientist, played by the always brilliant Robert Downey Jr. who has appeared in such films as \"The Singing Detective\", has kidnapped an eternally youthful and extremely shaggy dog and is performing particularly inhumane experiments on it. The dog escapes and bites the deputy D. A., causing him to periodically and temporarily morph into a shaggy dog, in turn allowing him to get closer to cracking the case and get closer to his family: his son (Spencer Breslin, who has already worked with Tim Allen in \"The Santa Clause 2\"), his kinda cute daughter (Zena Grey), and his definitely hot wife (Kristen Davis).There are two levels of humor in this movie. Young children will love Tim Allen's goofy physical humor. Older audiences should appreciate the more subtle tricks Tim Allen uses to make his human character seem increasingly dog-like. There are also some nifty computer generated effects, including a series of intriguing mutant animals. There is one special effects trick that is uncalled for, however: ridiculous \"cells\" that resemble dog-shaped clumps of grass that bark and pant their way through the main character's blood stream. These brief scenes take a lot away from the movie, which isn't anything to howl about, but is still entertaining and not a \"dog\" by any means.",

            "content": "It is now a fact of life...remakes are now practically their own genre. Now in my opinion as a film goer that's not a bad thing, I don't care what anyone says. There is nothing wrong with a good remake and I don't believe anything should be spared from a remake as long as it's done well, entertaining, fun....it potentially gives a whole new spin on a film to a whole new generation and that's good!! You can't go to a theater anymore without at least one remake playing. The Fog, Ocean's 11, The Amytiville Horror, Assault on Precinct 13, When A Stranger Calls...these are some of the better remakes as of recently. I can't honestly say I remember the original Shaggy Dog or it's follow ups but I love Disney films and in all fairness to a remake it's been nearly 5 decades since the original. I must admit The Shaggy Dog remake disappointed me which makes me very sad because I so badly wanted to love it.Tim Allen takes the lead as dog hating, hard working, family man Assistant D.A. Dave Douglas. Allen still does amusing physical comedy and he should be treated as more of a stand up comedian than they do. The Shaggy Dog had some amazing potential for terrific one liners with Allen's voice over when he is the dog but his script falls flat and he never really delivers any funny lines. However Allen still does a decent job, he's good on the big screen as the leading man. He is getting a little old and it shows but he's decent. Unfortunately they pegged a wife who looks like his daughter opposite him. Kristin Davis plays his wife. Now she does a good job, don't get me wrong but opposite Allen they look like father and daughter. Allen can't pull off a younger wife. They do have okay chemistry but they just aren't believable. Robert Downey Jr. is an absolute joke (and not in a funny, comedy way) as Dr. Kozak, the \"bad guy\" who is experimenting on animals in order to discover the secret to long lasting youth. He looks strung out (coincidence??) and he's annoying and he's never a viable threat to Allen's character. There is no bad guy vs good guy to this. Spencer Breslin, and Zena Grey play the Douglas children and they both do a decent job. This is one of Breslin's better roles as I've always found him a little annoying. The kids are used sparingly which could be a good thing or bad?? Danny Glover shows up briefly as Allen's boss (poor, poor Danny!) A more welcome cameo was Jane Curtin as the tough as nails and annoyed judge.I don't blame the lack of entertainment in this film on the cast (except Downey) it's really the lack luster script. The story is decent and kudos to them for trying to put a really good spin of a story on The Shaggy Dog who is a Tibetan dog that is 300 years old because his dog years work in reverse. It's almost too complicated of a story for such a simple film. The comedy relies about 90% on Allen behaving like a dog as a human or animals behaving likes dog (ie: Rabbits, frogs, snakes, monkeys.) The human acting like a dog thing gets old really quick!! Allen as a dog is quite amusing but as stated earlier the potential for quick witted voice over a la Look Who's Talking never happens. The film is not a complete loss...little children will adore it!! It's easy to follow and has juvenile slapstick humor. There are some genuinely amusing moments, most noted is Allen's first appearance in court when his dog attributes are beginning to show, and the animals escaping from the lab. And one of the classic moments is when Allen as the dog leaps from a bridge and yells \"From Infinity To Beyond\" (a reference from his voice work in Toy Story as the infamous Buzz Lightyear.) Talented director Brian Robbins who did great work on Varsity Blues, and The Perfect Score should not make family films. It lacked heart and passion and even the morality lesson Disney is famous for doesn't touch home at all. So I suggest not seeing this one unless you're bringing a really young one who will probably laugh to no end, otherwise a big disappointment. 5/10",

It was made to satisfy the nippers and the dog-loving medium - and it does that with massive success. This film is hilarious in parts - especially the court scenes, and the chase between Tim Allen and the cat was brilliantly done, and perhaps the best scene in the film. I don't see how this film did so bad - but it is good to see that this has come out of the bottom 100 - that is for films with no heart. The Shaggy Dog does have heart, as well as character, hilarity, relatively good CGI and a sharp script. Adults will love it too, if they are kids at heart. The Shaggy Dog is massively predictable and has no particularly memorable one-liners or emotional scenes, but it is fun, and did relatively well at the box office. After all, it is made for kids, and I don't see why any kid wouldn't enjoy it.The Shaggy Dog is no masterpiece, but it is hugely funny, and is never dull or pointless.

            "content": "\"The Shaggy Dog\" (2006) Directed By: Brian Robbins Starring: Tim Allen, Kristin Davis, Robert Downey Jr., Zena Grey, Spencer Breslin, Danny Glover, & Shawn Pyfrom MPAA Rating: \"PG\" (some mild rude humor) I had heard such bad things about this remake of \"The Shaggy Dog\". Most critics loathed it and IMDb users were quick to pound it with extremely low ratings. So, when I was sitting down to watch it, I expected a disaster\u0097one of the year's worst movies. Did I get what I expected? Well, absolutely not. In fact, I found it to be quite delightful\u0085silly and immature, but a pleasant watch. It was predictably cheesy and I have seen hundreds of movies almost exactly like it before, but there is something to be said for movies that exist solely for the purpose of entertainment. And that is what \"The Shaggy Dog\" (2006) is. It never expected to break any new ground in cinema and it, most certainly, doesn't, yet it is a film that the entire family can sit down together and watch. The children will laugh at the obvious physical humor and the various animal behaviors and parents will enjoy some of the more mature humor (not crude or bad humor, but humor that most children will not understand). It's an entertaining film with a quick pace. Though, with all of that said, \"The Shaggy Dog\" (2006) has much room for improvement. The new genetic testing twist on this old story makes the movie a little too weird and the movie falls for so many unnecessary clich\u00e9s.Dave Douglas (Allen) is the deputy district attorney of his town and is on the path to become the next district attorney. He has a beautiful wife, Rebecca (Davis), and two wonderful children, Carly (Grey) and Josh (Breslin), and is on what could possibly be the biggest case of his life\u0097the prosecution of the animal rights' activist, Justin Forrester (Joshua Leonard), who supposedly attempted to burn down a laboratory, suspected of animal testing. Everything seems to be going perfectly for him, except for the fact that his children don't like him and his relationship with his wife is becoming increasingly strained. However, when his daughter brings home a dog that escaped from this lab and it bites Dave, he finds himself becoming more and more dog-like, until he actually turns into a dog. As a dog, he realizes the problems within his family and also sees the evil and corruption in the company he was once protecting. In the 1959 version of \"The Shaggy Dog\", a boy turned into a sheep dog due to a magical spell. Somehow, I found that plot to be far more believable. Sure, both scenarios are impossible, but the way this 2006 version presented its plot just didn't come off as realistic. Unfortunately, this was a huge part of the movie. An audience needs to be able to believe what they are watching, no matter how implausible it is. \"The Shaggy Dog\" (2006) fails in that aspect\u0085probably due to the gaping plot holes.The performances in \"The Shaggy Dog\" (2006) are good\u0085nothing overly special, but believable. Tim Allen does a nice job, but watching him run around on all-fours was just plain weird, which was not his fault. He gave his all for this movie, though, and that is what counts. Kristin Davis is always delightful and this is especially true here. She is just such a genuine actress. Robert Downey Jr. just didn't completely sell me, unfortunately. He overacted a little too much and came off as silly and comical, rather than eccentric and creepy. Zena Grey and Spencer Breslin did exactly what I expected. They delivered their dialog well and were perfectly adequate given the movie and their roles. Danny Glover could do so much better than a small part in this movie. Any actor could have been cast in his part and I wouldn't have noticed. It would have been different had he had a major part, like Tim Allen, Kristin Davis, and Robert Downey Jr., but he should not be wasted on such a small part. Shawn Pyfrom, like Grey and Breslin, did what I expected him to do, which was perfectly sufficient. Jane Curtin, like Glover, is wasted on a small part\u0085but she does have an important part. It could have still been played by any actress, but Curtin gives it something of her own. She does fine.Overall, \"The Shaggy Dog\" (2006) is entertainment\u0085pure and simple. It's a fun movie with plenty of laughs. It won't be remembered as a movie that changed cinema forever, but it still serves its purpose. Though, it was certainly not perfect. What was with the excessive use of mediocre CGI? Yes, CGI was necessary for some scenes, but it should have looked more polished\u0097more realistic. Here, it doesn't. The special effects are mediocre and come off as cheesy and laughable. Also, \"The Shaggy Dog\" (2006) succumbs to so many unnecessary clich\u00e9s. For example when the keeper of the dog pound bends over, his pants rip, revealing his underwear. Why? What did filmmakers feel would come from this scene? On top of this, it suffers from gaping plot holes. Why did the original dog live so long? If he was just a dog who lived longer than usual, why did he express many human characteristics throughout the movie? Many things just did not connect in this movie, but its target audience (children) will probably not notice and only movie-fans and critics will probably care enough to wonder. When this movie ended, I had a smile on my face and that is what this movie wanted. It wanted to entertain and entertain, it does.Final Thought: Though silly and predictable, \"The Shaggy Dog\" (2006) is sure to entertain.Overall Rating: 6/10 (B)",

            "content": "The Shaggy Dog/2006/*** Main Stars: Tim Allen Robert Downey Jr. Kristin DavisThe typical funny, serious, and touching Disney Film Productions brings to you another funny, serious, and touching film called The Shaggy Dog based on the original The Shaggy Dog (1959) and The Shaggy D.A. (1976). This remake is based a bit more on The Shaggy D.A because Tim Allen's character Dave Douglas is supposedly going to be promoted one and his wife Rebecca (Kristin Davis) seems excited for the promotion. The film opens with a police force in a helicopter looking for a dog, which is shaggy and will be the star of the film, which is over one hundred years old since every seven years it lives one year or something like that. So yes we know it's old and blahbitty bloo but yet that's not the main part of the film. Before I saw the film in the theater, I was pondering about how Tim Allen is going to turn into a dog/human that acts like one. To me it was rather intelligent; actually the whole movie was with the more modern screenplay to follow by with reaction of cells, mutated animals, the whole chestnut. And so Dave is the defendant against the plaintiff who committed arson (\"allegedly\") and whom Robert Downey Junior's character Dr. Kozak wants guilty so he can become wealthy instead of Lance Strickland (Philip Baker Hall) getting all the money for himself. You'll find out the jury's decision and what led to it. I really thought the movie was intelligent not only because there were six writers of the film but yet the film itself somewhat showed it\u0085 The music by the famous composer Alan Menken was very well done and the acting was impressive for a Disney film. I could tell it took a lot of time to train the actual dog itself because of the typing on the laptop with the pencil and looking up and down at the right time. The movie was bright, had a sense of love, humor, seriousness, etc. It wasn't the best becuaaaaase it was kiddy and there are more movie genres to like better than this one. Yet the film went along easily/smoothly\u0085 When Dave would see a cat, he would chase it and when he'd see a dog he'd get anxious. In the elevator, if someone commanded his or her dog to sit, he would instead. If he saw food he would be tempted to take it and eat it himself then slowly stop and say sorry embarrassed for what he's done. He'd sip his coffee by licking it and eat his cereal face down. Everything you would not see a normal human do like growling at an opposing witness in the courtroom who's not on your side. All these things seemed funny\u0085 When your heart rate goes down, you're human. When your heart rate goes up, you're dog. When you turn back into a human from dog form be sure to be in your own home by yourself or in a stall in a bathroom which Tim Allen failed to do numerous times. This was one of the few Disney films that kept me watching besides Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. I truly liked the story and how he turned into a dog and how he turned back human. Then there are other matters going on at home that soon transform into problems. I think you'll enjoy this film.

It does have some modernizations done to the story line as well as the production.Two thumbs up from us!",

The sets were horrible. The comedy was nonexistent. The plot was stupid. I watched the whole movie with my 6 year old and neither of us laughed once. I mean, come on. Even the \"Cat in the Hat\" got the *parents* to laugh once and the kids to laugh a few times. I swear that Tim Allen had no idea what was going on on screen and was test reading the script when he read his lines.My daughter kept asking me if we could leave. \"Is it over yet? Can we go now?\"If you're looking for something to take your kids to, take them to the playground instead of this. Even if you're there for 10 minutes, it'll be more fun than watching this piece of junk.",

I couldn't sit through it again, but i wasn't looking at my watch every 10 minutes. Tim Allen takes the role that he seems quite adept to these days. A normal family man who gets put into extreme circumstances and become a better person because of it. His wife is played by the only tasty one from sex in the city. Which i know isn't pivotal to the plot, I thought it was well worth a mention. His kids are pretty well played to. Lots of son/daughter bonding and a great deal of cheese that US movies seem to preach these days. Anyway, don't be so harsh on a movie that is basically made for kids and aimed at kids.",

            "content": "A solid cast and nostalgic feel blend to make the newest incarnation of the old faithful, The Shaggy Dog, a fine evening out with the kids. Every decade or so, Disney recreates the movie that is the paradigm of Disney family fare. Whereas in both the 1959 original, starring Fred MacMurray and Tommy Kirk, and in this remake, the star turns into a sheep dog at the most inconvenient times, in this remake, it is the dad who transforms, not the son. Like the original, the laughs are not side-splitting, but rather the kind that make you smile.Tim Allen (The Santa Claus, Christmas With the Kranks), a dependable actor, wears his role like a comfortable pair of tennis shoes. Typecast as the lovable - if insensitive - dad, Allen seems resigned to his role, and plays it well. Kristin Davis (The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl) is believable as the frustrated wife and mother.Zena Grey (In Good Company) and Spencer Breslin (Cat in the Hat) perform like old troopers, but the stand out performance goes to Robert Downey Jr, who excels as the neurotic nemesis.Like always, this Disney flick earns 10 stars for clean family fun, and an 8 for special effects, but because of a weakness in the script (the writers couldn't quite make up their mind why our star turns into a dog), I must rate The Shaggy Dog a 7.",

The original Shaggy Dog was only mildly amusing, but it was a masterpiece compared to the remake, which like most remakes, is just lazy garbage. Movies have become Big Macs, rapidly prepared junk food for an increasingly lazy audience. While Allen's Shaggy Dog is certainly better than Santa Clause 2 or Zoom, it's still mind-numbingly dull, even for the child audience it was obviously made for. I understand they're making a Santa Clause 3. Somebody should tell Tim Allen to retire before he embarrasses himself further.",

            "content": "Apparently, The Shaggy Dog is a remake from the 1959 Disney classic with the same name, which I haven't seen yet. I was overly surprised how much I liked the film, but perhaps it was just the animal lover in me. I could see through the formulaic plot and the silliness of the film, but those animals were cute and I always like efforts people put in to save animals. This is terrific family entertainment and the kids will enjoy the film. It is obviously not a great film, but it is a good, earnest film.Brian Robbin's film is about a man named Dave Douglas who is an Assistant DA and never has time for his family and hates animals. One day, he gets bitten by an escaped sheepdog, who was captured in Nepal and has secret aging powers. After being bitten, Dave's life is turned upside down as he turns into a sheepdog.The acting isn't terrific, but it's passable. Tim Allen made for a quite funny Douglas and it was entertaining to see him acting as a dog. Robert Downey Jr is okay as the man who has an agenda with his company. Kristen Davis made for a good wife of Douglas. We also get good appearances from Danny Glover and Philip Baker Hall, but I wonder if they are needed in the first place.Overall, the Shaggy Dog is good for family entertainment and a film not to be taken seriously by movie fanatics. There are many amusing moments, such as these grown men acting as dogs. It is not that realistic, but it does have a fun story. The ending was a bit weak, however. But my mother enjoyed this film and I won't lie when I say I did as well. It is not the greatest, but it's passable entertainment. I rate this film 7.5/10.",

            "content": "When I ask, \"where's the magic?\" I'm not talking about the magic that turns Tim Allen into a sheep dog. I'm talking about the \"Disney Magic.\" I realize that a bunch of you have already commented on this, but now I'd like to add my two cents.The original \"Shaggy Dog\" movie was released in 1959 (my parents were about three years old). I constantly watched it on video when I was a kid. It was cheesy, sappy, corny, etc. Even though the story was silly, the acting bad, and the special effects tacky, it had a certain charm and squishy Disney cuteness that made it appealing. I watched it recently, and I still liked it even though I'm a 26-year-old man now.The fact that the new movie sucks has nothing to do with the fact that I'm old and jaded. It doesn't have to do with the bad acting (except for Tim Allen, who, as always, did well with what he was given) or lame special effects. Disney has lost its magic. You can only do so many remakes and sequels of a movie before it turns into a clich\u00e9 and loses all the creativity and charisma of the original. This is about the fourth or fifth remake and/or sequel of the original, and it's not cute any more. It's the Xerox effect. If you keep making copies of something, you lose the all the sharpness and clarity that you began with.Disney has perfected this over the last ten years. They've ruined just about every classic they ever made by coming out with a cheap remake or thrown-together sequel. The Shaggy Dog has gone from being a silly story about an awkward teenager trying to deal with life as all these crazy things start happening to him (totally relatable story, by the way), into a goofy special effects showcase about a lawyer who's prosecuting a tree-hugging hippie teacher, only to find out that the teacher isn't a criminal but was framed by these evil scientists who are doing genetic testing on animals (I could go off on how Disney always tries to put some liberal message into all of its new movies, but this isn't a political website).If the good people at Disney would put more time and effort into making new and original films, they could once again become a great company. Instead they make mediocre original stuff and lackluster rehashes, and they're wasting their money. If all their resources would go into new ventures, we would probably see fewer movies from them each year, but we would once again be astounded and mesmerized by that Disney magic.",

            "content": "Here we go with another remake of a film that wasn't all that great to begin with (see \"Yours, Mine & Ours\" \"The Fog,\" and \"The Hills Have Eyes\" as recent examples). Original was released in 1959 and starred Fred MacMurrary and Tommy Kirk, among others, and wasn't the high mark of Disney entertainment, although it was not that bad.Competently directed by Brian Robbins (TV series \"One Tree Hill\"), this new version features Tim Allen (\"Christmas With The Kranks\") as a Los Angeles district attorney, Dave Douglas, trying to climb the corporate ladder \u0096 while ignoring his lovely wife, Rebecca (Kristin Davis, \"Shark Boy & Lava Girl,\" the TV series \"Sex and the City\"), and two cute kids, Carly (Zena Grey, \"In Good Company\") and Josh (Spencer Breslin, \"Cat in the Hat\").Dave is prosecuting Carly's teacher, who is accused of firebombing a local chemical company because they experiment on animals (fun family plot, so far), but, in a zany mix-up, the lawyer is bitten by a 300-year-old Tibetan sheepdog (although some sources identify this breed as a bearded collie).This causes the special effects to go into high gear, as he grows a floppy tongue, super sensitive hearing and the ability to run on all fours before finally turning into a sheepdog (or bearded collie) himself.Thank goodness he communicates through inner dialogue, though, and not the creepy animated animal mouth movements. His effort to relate his new form to his family is also rather amusing (as they think he has left them), using a Scrabble game to spell out his dilemma and finding out his son would rather be in \"Grease\" than play football.Meanwhile, (as a pup) finds out that corporate hack, Dr. Kozak (Robert Downey, Jr.) is indeed using animals to develop a fountain of youth drug. The effects are lacking somewhat when we see the beasts (a ridiculous dog-frog and cobra-canine mutations, as well as rabbits, monkeys and rats that bark), which are as silly as those featured in one of the worst films of 2005, \"A Sound Of Thunder.\"Kids will like this, and adults will not be too put off, either, but you'd probably be better off to rent or buy the original, for its better acting, more interesting storyline and absence of Tim Allen.",

Where's Lon Cheney Jr. when ya' need him? Instead of a snarly werewolf, a friendly weredog? Also, who retrieves his clothes and how many wallets and I.D. did he lose? Ignoring all this, a rather silly and funny \"Tim Allen Vehicle\" with only a few tasteless \"dog-sniffing and bathroom\" jokes. It plays like a fantasy so don't take it too seriously, but the use of a \"Taser\" several times is disturbing, as are the mutant lab animals. \"Cole\" the dog is terrific.

I read the user reviews, and it seemed a lot better than that, but I thought I'd pass. Then I went over to some friends' house, and their 13-year-old son said, \"Why do you care what rating it got? If you aren't expecting it to be a great movie, then you could still just go and see it and have some laughs and have a good time.\" I decided he was right, and I really enjoyed it. I loved the \"evil plot\", in which Robert Downey, Jr.'s character had captured a 300-year-old sheep dog in order to extract material that could produce immortality in man, even though some of his early experiments produced some weird part-dog/part-other animal creatures. In the end, it played out like a funny sci-fi movie, but with a message: Tim Allen's assistant D.A. character was spending too much time on his job, which included a trial against a teacher who protested the way they were using animals at the company where Downey's character worked. It took changing to a dog to be able to see that he was missing many things that were going on with his family, and that they were all suffering for it. Then he was able to reorder his priorities, as well as go after the bad guy!It is not surprising that this theme of spending so much time on one's job surfaces so frequently. It is endemic in our society. But enough of all that. Just take time to go and see the movie and enjoy it, and forget the ratings! This wasn't supposed to be a piece on rocket science!!!",

Allen is transformed into a sheep dog, then back to himself, and so on, at monotonously regular intervals, with consequences that will adequately pass the time for an easily amused 8 year old, but no-one else. I get the feeling this could have been a funny movie - perhaps without Mr Allen. There are plenty of clever ideas here, but they go thud in his uninspiring hands. The actors who play his kids aren't much better, and they aren't even cute! The cast includes Kristin Davis (Sex & the City), Robert Downey Jnr, Danny Glover and Jane Curtin (3rd Rock From the Sun), but you get the feeling they've been deliberately restrained by a director who's determined no-one will laugh. Photography and production values are high, but the money has been squandered. Question: in the last 10 years, how many movie dads are workaholics who don't spend enough time with their kids?

That being said, then this 2006 version starring Tim Allen is still an entertaining and fun movie for the entire family.The story needs very little introduction, so I will make it brief and to the point. \"The Shaggy Dog\" is about Dave Douglas, a busy lawyer, who is bitten by a sheep dog and finds himself changing between dog and human shape.This is not really one of the best Tim Allen movies in terms of comedy aspects and laughs. So on that account, you might be a bit disappointed if you watch the movie hoping to find something hilarious. This is a family movie spiced up with some comedy elements. I sat down with the Family to watch \"The Shaggy Dog\", so we got our money's worth here.They did manage to draft some nice names for the movie, which did add a good deal of enjoyment to the movie. The movie did benefit well from having Tim Allen in the lead, of course. But also Kristin Davis, Danny Glover, Jane Curtin and Robert Downey Jr. did add something good to the movie, despite not having all that big roles individually.One thing that didn't really go well with me was the lack of visuals in the scenes where Dave Douglas changed from man to dog, and vice versa. It would have been a nice detail to the movie if we had actually seen the transition on the screen. And because this was lacking from the movie, it sort of dragged the overall enjoyment down a notch.\"The Shaggy Dog\" is a fun enough movie for the family, especially if you have children watching too. However, this 2006 version is not as good as the original movie in my opinion.All in all, an adequate movie, although it wasn't outstanding. As such I am rating it six out of ten stars.",

            "content": "The Shaggy Dog (2006): Dir: Brian Robbins / Cast: Tim Allen, Robert Downey Jr., Kristen Davis, Spencer Breslin, Zena Grey: Remake of the 1959 Disney classic about personality and distinction. For whatever reason there is an ageless sheepdog that is captured and in situations too lame to discuss in detail a lawyer played by Tim Allen is bitten by a dog thus gaining the habits and eventually appearance of a dog. Although Brian Robbins produces some unique point of voice aspect s, he is still directing the same dog dung as when he made Good Burger and Hardball. Varsity Blues remains his one recommended gem. Tim Allen scratches, pants, snarls, chases cats, fetches, and even uses the urinal with one leg lifted. Robert Downey Jr. should fire his agent after this embarrassing performance as a scientist doing illegal testing on animals. Kristen Davis is flat as Allen's wife. She is basically there to suspect nothing and be supportive while the kids eventually get wind of the situation and attempt to help out. Spencer Breslin and Zena Grey play the children who struggle to help their father figure this stupid dilemma out. The special effects pass the test but the screenplay is nothing more than a canvas for dumb dog jokes, most of which are expected. Theme of limitations done justice in the original while the makers of this film produce a remake that should be buried. Score: 3 / 10",

But strangely enough, this film is quite disturbing in scenes that are supposed to be laugh out loud funny.Seeing a warped Allen chase a cat, shake after having a shower, sleeping on a bed in a weird way, or sniffing and growling, were supposed to be the key hilarity factor in this.But it isn't. In fact, it's downright freaky in a way that just cannot be described. Allen looks like he's made a big mistake signing on to this, and the rest of the cast look bewildered, apart from Downey Jr. who looks like he is just off his face.The effects are poor, and for a film that's aimed at youngsters, anything featuring the bad guy inject a man so he will be paralysed for months, and Allen being nude four times, has to raise alarm bells.And the surfing dog is stuff of nightmares.A Disney horror, in more ways than one...",

His daughter is becoming an environmental activist against a company Dave is working FOR and his son is hiding a secret dream to be a thespian, not a football star. His wife (Kristin Davis) just feels neglected. It turns out that the large pharmaceutical company Dave supports just may have something to hide, after all. Dave is bitten by an experimental dog his daughter has rescued from the plant and suddenly, Dave's hair is shaggy and he scratches behind the ears! All of this occurs at most inappropriate times, natch. Will Dave see the error of his ways at home and on the job? Or will his life go to the dogs? This cute movie is sure to please a family who wishes to sit down and enjoy a film together. Allen is funny as the man who has to experience life as a canine before he discovers what is really important. The supporting cast, including the wonderful Robert Downey, Jr., is very winning and the special effects are first rate. The sunny setting is pleasing and conducive to the upbeat manner of the movie. Yes, the first Shaggy Dog is a true classic and this one falls just short of this stature.

That's thanks to some lazy writing and humour, none of the jokes land while the plot - while I praise them for changing up the original - is so lame - their thinking seemingly just stopped at 'man acts like dog' and thought that'll do.Another thing that hampers the film is the attempt at a heartwarming story with the main family, which is nauseating to see unfold. There's also a scene at the end where the dad (Allen) is stark naked in public and in front of his children, who have literally zero reaction and just stand there smiling ...With that noted, I will say I didn't hate watching this. Tim Allen, whilst over-the-top and in your face at times, is a good cast to play this silly role - he stops the character of Dave becoming annoying, he's just cringey to me.The casting is, actually, pretty good. Robert Downey Jr. and Danny Glover are involved, as are recognisable faces Spencer Breslin, Shawn Pyfrom, Philip Baker Hall and Joel David Moore. Rhea Seehorn, star of 'Better Call Saul', also appears - you could make a case that this is a prequel to BCS ...I have no idea why they decided to remake this, especially given they seemingly didn't put any serious effort into it.

            "content": "Forgive my mind. This is wholly an above-average entertainment. The script, the directing, the editing.. All the elements delivered a fantasy about how the dog could be more present and helpful than the absent dad sometimes; acrid metaphor I know, but smartly done. It is too innocent for its time, but really enjoyable and exciting. All the cast did memorable job. (Zena Grey), for instance, was ultra-cute. But OH MY GOD, (Tim Allen) was on the top of his game. He was classic; having the charisma, the talent, the credibility, and being that lovable. He just excelled in the details, looking like a real dog for all the time. His performance here doesn't deserve to be watched for one time at all.This time, I have only few points to talk about harshly; they didn't poke fun out of a great talent like (Jane Curtin), dealing with her character as just a judge. (Danny Glover) is totally wasted in a role that I thought it would've been better if they ever handed it over the old movie's lead (Dean Jones), who was very much alive at the moment, hitting his mid seventies. The matter of (Allen) losing his clothes, with the cell phone, more than once, then nobody notices that, or how he regains that every time, bugged me slightly. The character played by (Robert Downey Jr.) was yes evil and stuff, but I think he just got a point about the freeness of the scientific researches that seemed at last utterly refused! And at the end, the problem of the lead turning into a dog wasn't solved at all?! But maybe that was deliberate in case this movie hit it high, and admitted a sequel. However, still the deepest problem is that while I was so happy during the viewing, I found myself all sad later, feeling pity for (Disney)!Look at this little discovering of mine; since the late 1960s to the late 1970s, there were many original movies. 3 of them got the name, and the fame, of (The Love Bug - 1968), (Freaky Friday - 1976), and (The Shaggy D.A. - 1976) which was a sequel to 1959 movie (The Shaggy Dog).After 2 decades, (Disney) would exploit the success of these cinematic hits, however on a TV level. So, we witnessed follow-ups or remakes like (The Love Bug - 1997), (Freaky Friday - 1995), and (The Shaggy Dog - 1994). Thank God that the IMDb exists to know that I'm right.Then, in the next decade, the same good old movies would turn into another follow-ups or remakes again, however for the big screen as (Herbie Fully Loaded - 2005), (Freaky Friday - 2003), and our dear (The Shaggy Dog - 2006). It's not the circulation of nature. It's rather the story of copyrights that have to be used. And studios that got lately not many brilliant scripts to be made.. That's unnatural enough for me!At first, I was thinking about a title for my review like \"Disney is forever\". But by the ending, I was suggesting things like \"Disney is remaking forever!\" or \"Disney's remaking is forever!\". Simply, if that is a wonderful remake of a wonderful original movie, then where are the wonderful original movies of today?! And why, just why, all of these efforts can't be used in another, more original, and as good, movies?! And how about the fact of these 3 last remakes as the best of what I've had from (Disney) in the past 10 years?! Many questions jump up and down in my mind because of this fun movie.. So that's why I said at the start: forgive my mind!This is a movie where the worst of it is that it's a remake!",

            "content": "I finally saw \"The Shaggy Dog\" from 1959 for the first time earlier this month, and while I found it to be no family masterpiece, I still thought it was pretty good. I remember when this 2006 remake came out, and I saw that Tim Allen, a comedian I saw in more than one movie in my childhood, starred in it. I never saw this family movie when it was first out, and didn't know it was a remake, but now know that it's the second remake of the 1959 Disney film, the first one being a TV film from 1994, which I haven't seen and don't care if I never do. After finally watching the original, I intended to watch this theatrically released remake, but I did think it would be far inferior to the version I had previously seen, and now, after seeing it, I think I was correct.A 300 year old Bearded Collie is kidnapped from a Buddhist monastery in Tibet by a group of geneticists led by Dr. Kozak! The animal is brought back to the United States, where the scientists begin to study his mutation, which is what has made him live so long, and intend to make life-extending medicine out of it! Meanwhile, Dave Douglas is a deputy district attorney who hates dogs, and his teenage daughter, Carly, is one of the activists who accuse Grant & Strickland, the company that has secretly kidnapped the dog, of cruel animal testing. The Bearded Collie manages to escape, and is found by Carly and her boyfriend, Trey, as they are searching for evidence of animal testing. This dog isn't the proof they're looking for, but they bring him back to the Douglas home to keep as a pet, calling him Shaggy. Dave obviously doesn't approve when he sees this, and Shaggy ends up biting him, so the mutated dog is taken to the pound. After this, Dave soon starts acting like a dog, and then actually turns into one! Tim Allen plays the same kind of role I remember seeing him play when I was a kid in the 90's (though certainly not in \"Toy Story\"), and that's a neglectful, insensitive father. This felt a little tiresome to me when I saw him play this role again here. Needless to say, since this is a comedy, one would obviously want laughs from it, but personally, I don't think I found any of those (I didn't keep a straight face throughout, but usually did). There are many gags involving Dave acting like a dog while in human form, and these may be funny to a lot of kids, but I just found them consistently lame and SO cheap that anyone could come up with them, no comedic talent required! Unfortunately, none of the other gags are funny enough to make up for this. I found some of the film pretty much disgusting, with its lame gags and clich\u00e9s! Later on, I did find that the plot gets more exciting, after being pretty dull for the most part beforehand, and if this change didn't happen, then maybe even my 4/10 rating would be too generous! It seems that movie remakes can often be poorly received, and understandably, this is one of them. The original \"Shaggy Dog\" isn't hilarious, but it sure is funnier than this lacklustre 2006 version! If this remake (with lots of differences from the original) starring Tim Allen is strictly for kids, then it was way too late for me by the time it came out, as I was almost twenty years old by then. I guess some adults do like this version, and I won't fault them for that, but I really think kids are much more likely to enjoy it. It's definitely not one of those really well crafted family films that can be equally entertaining for all ages. The 1959 version has its share of flaws, and I can understand why it's not one of the most popular productions from the early decades of Disney, but I've made it clear that I still like it a lot better than this theatrical remake, and I'm sure I'm not alone.",

The movie also pulls some predictable heartstrings when it comes to fathers' relationships with their children and spouses.

            "content": "Review originally published on March 7, 2006:Here we go with another remake of a film that wasn't all that great to begin with (see \"Yours, Mine & Ours\" \"The Fog,\" and \"The Hills Have Eyes\" as recent examples). Original was released in 1959 and starred Fred MacMurrary and Tommy Kirk, among others, and wasn't the high mark of Disney entertainment, although it was not that bad.Competently directed by Brian Robbins (TV series \"One Tree Hill\"), this new version features Tim Allen (\"Christmas With The Kranks\") as a Los Angeles district attorney, Dave Douglas, trying to climb the corporate ladder \u2013 while ignoring his lovely wife, Rebecca (Kristin Davis, \"Shark Boy & Lava Girl,\" the TV series \"Sex and the City\"), and two annoyingly cute kids, Carly (Zena Grey, \"In Good Company\") and Josh (Spencer Breslin, \"Cat in the Hat\").Dave is prosecuting Carly's teacher, who is accused of firebombing a local chemical company because they experiment on animals (fun family plot, so far), but, in a zany mix-up, the lawyer is bitten by a 300-year-old Tibetan sheepdog (although some sources identify this breed as a bearded collie).This causes the special effects to go into high gear, as he grows a floppy tongue, super sensitive hearing and the ability to run on all fours before finally turning into a sheepdog (or bearded collie) himself.Thank goodness he communicates through inner dialogue, though, and not creepy animated animal mouth movements. His effort to relate his new form to his family is also rather amusing (as they think he has abandoned them), using a Scrabble game to spell out his dilemma and finding out his son would rather be in \"Grease\" than play football (hey, who wouldn't?).Meanwhile, (as a pup) he finds out that corporate hack, Dr. Kozak (Robert Downey, Jr.) is indeed using animals to develop a fountain of youth drug. The effects are lacking somewhat when we see the beasts (a ridiculous dog-frog and cobra-canine mutations, as well as rabbits, monkeys and rats that bark), which are as cheap and silly as those featured in one of the worst films of 2005, \"A Sound Of Thunder.\"Kids will like this, and adults will not be too put off, either, but you'd probably be wiser to just rent or buy the original, for its better acting, more interesting storyline and absence of Tim Allen.",

Tim Allen made so many public comments on how he thought the originals could be improved, forsaking the fantasy element for a Sci-Fi element, and THIS is what he came up with? There were so many writers attached to this project over the years and it shows-this is a case of too many cooks spoiling the dog food.In the original movies where a magic ring caused him to turn into a dog, you could just sort of let logic go out the window and not question why he could still speak when he had a dog's vocal apparatus, hold a toothbrush without opposable thumbs, etc. But this movie takes a Sci-Fi approach where it happens because of genetic mutation-not to say it has to have the realism of a scientific documentary, we can still suspend disbelief in a family comedy...but can anyone answer these questions for me: 1) Why is it that all of the other animals in the lab only partially become dog-like...such as a snake having bushy dog fur at the end of its tail? And there are several other primates present that just take on dog behavior-why is it that Tim Allen's character takes on the dog behavior in his human form but then sporadically turns completely into a dog? MAJOR SPOILER HERE: And then why does Robert Downey Jr. only grow a tail when he gets infected? END MAJOR SPOILER 2)How it is that when he turns into the dog, his clothing just mysteriously slips off of him? I mean the guy is a hotshot attorney wearing buttoned-up business suits, are you telling me he goes from man-to-dog and there is not struggle? In the movie he doesn't even NOTICE it happens until after he has changed!!! 3) There is absolutely no resolution in the end...OK, perhaps they are waiting for a sequel,but what about his mutated dog genes? Does he have to go the rest of his life never knowing when he will turn into a dog? Again, if this were just a fantasy I would be able to suspend a great deal more disbelief. But Mr. Allen was so gung-ho about modernizing it and making it scientific; I say, for what?The Shaggy Dog and The Shaggy DA were both among the top-grossing movies for the years they were released and for good reason, they were just out to have fun. This movie focuses way to much on his relationship with his family and not enough on the easy sight-gags that made the first two so funny.Do you know that we never even SEE him transform into the dog...it always happens off-camera. What could POSSIBLY be more interesting than seeing the leading man turn into a dog (did co-producer Tim Allen arrange this so he would not have to spend hours in make-up)?

My advice if you see this movie: consult a mental health professional, or bring really big knife.",

Touching, funny, messages about family, good special effects on the animals, I would say this is just as good for adults as it is for kids. Why can't movies be something to sit down for 90 minutes and just be enjoyed anymore? I am assuming some of the ratings are from teens which brought down the rating. No swearing, killing, sex or blood, so it's a piece of junk to them. Wholesome entertainment is junk to most of them. Tim does an excellent job as does Robert Downey Jr, and the rest of the cast. This is a quality family film. I highly suggest it to everyone with a sense of humor and someone who has a heart and believes in family.",

Like Cuba in Snow Dogs, Dave is not a big fan of canines.

            "content": "After seeing The Shaggy Dog, I realized something. Tim Allen looked really stupid acting like a dog. But, for a guy that's clueless, you deserve a rude awakening. The dog bite on his hand gave him loads to think about. He even had to become a dog to prove a point, especially when your daughter's telling you the truth. He realized that after he became a dog, she was right. Kozak was up to something. I'm glad Kozak got bit too, in order to prove what was going on in that lab. Kozak did a good thing revealing the truth as well by acting like a dog. After he acted like a dog and chased his tail, he was busted. I kept singing \"Somebody's in trouble, Kozak's in trouble,\" until he was out of the court room. By the way, I hope he gets a chance to go outside if the prison guards let him. Who knows, he might keep getting hit with a rolled up newspaper while in prison. As far as Allen, he can resume letting out any dog expressions since he probably doesn't have a choice. He got infected. So most of the time, he can't control himself. Don't worry. Kirk Cameron had to deal with it in You Lucky Dog, only without the infection from a dog bite. He learned to deal with it after acting like a dog for 3 times. Which is 3 strikes, you're stuck. He got use to it and was able to let his feelings out. I said this once and I'll say it again \"Tim Allen, go ahead and act like a dog.\" Let it all out. Tim Allen needed to wake up and realize what's going on. So, acting like a dog and becoming a dog proved a point. He had to do it to prove a point. I've been thinking about what role Tim Allen played in this movie and the role Kirk Cameron played in You Lucky Dog. Sometimes when they act brainless, I usually would say \"Talk to the hand\" and move on. And there are other times when I realize that they acted like a dog to prove a point. They both saved someone's lives by acting like a dog. Sometimes acting like a dog was pretty helpful. It was helpful for Lucky in You Lucky Dog and it was helpful for Forster in this movie. He was going to prison for something that he didn't do. So, we should tell Cameron and Allen thank you for acting like a dog because it helped proved a point and it saved someone's behind. They both looked stupid, but who cares? They did it prove a point. Plus, they pretty much got their treats in the end.",

There's also a scene at the end where the dad (Allen) is stark naked in public and in front of his children, who have literally zero reaction and just stand there smiling ...\n\nWith that noted, I will say I didn't hate watching this. Tim Allen, whilst over-the-top and in your face at times, is a good cast to play this silly role - he stops the character of Dave becoming annoying, he's just cringey to me.\n\nThe casting is, actually, pretty good. Robert Downey Jr. and Danny Glover are involved, as are recognisable faces Spencer Breslin, Shawn Pyfrom, Philip Baker Hall and Joel David Moore. Rhea Seehorn, star of 'Better Call Saul', also appears - you could make a case that this is a prequel to BCS ...\n\nI have no idea why they decided to remake this, especially given they seemingly didn't put any serious effort into it.

So revisiting that concept with Tim Allen in the lead role doesn\u2019t seem like a great idea. This movie\u2019s attempt at comedy always revolves around a man doing things like a dog, and it is never funny. Aside from the transforming into a dog part, the heart of the story is so clich\u00e9d that I\u2019m not sure anyone actually wrote it or if they just copy-and-pasted from one of a hundred other Disney movies. \u201cDad\u2019s too involved with his job, and is neglecting his family...will he ever wake up and see what he\u2019s missing?\u201d I\u2019m sure you can write the rest yourself. The idea that the original dog in this movie is some kind of magical being that can be used to prolong life is already ludicrous, but then they double down by making it so he turns people into weredogs when they are bit. But all kinds of stupid ideas are taken in stride by the characters in this movie. People take the idea of Tim Allen\u2019s character turning into a dog as if it makes perfect sense after the initial shock, and the fact that he continues to struggle with just telling people about it is frustrating. In fact the entire movie is frustration because so many plot lines could be resolved in seconds with a simple conversation but instead they take the most convoluted steps to make the movie feature length. The Shaggy Dog is what you get when lazy people start making movies without intention or purpose. It\u2019s as if they just took a look at Disney\u2019s catalogue of classics, looked for which one they could remake next, and didn\u2019t put even an ounce of thought into a way of making it new or interesting. I cannot express this enough...there is nothing of value in The Shaggy Dog. It is not funny, it is not thought-provoking, it is not well-acted, and it is not entertaining in any way. Children might become dumber after watching this movie, so just avoid it like the plague.",

            "content": "This movie. This fucking movie. Fuck this movie.\n\nSo it's a remake of some 1957 movie, which I'm assuming was good. This movie was not.\n\nThe plot is convoluted as shit. Basically, there's some magically dog, living with some monks in Tibet, and it's been alive for 300 years. Bad guy, Robert Downey Jr. (doing his best Tony Stark), is the second in command of evil co (the real name escapes me) that kidnaps the dog and tries to isolate the fountain of youth gene from the dog. Tim Allen (doing his best...well I don't know, he's horrendous in this) is second in command at the DA's office and he's prosecuting his precious twat daughter's teacher for trying to burn down evil co's lab. ALREADY, my fingers hurt from typing this retarded plot. This is just the basis of it. I didn't even get to the part where he's a bad dad.\n\nSo he's a bad dad, and you are reminded constantly of this. He wants his deep in the closet son to play football, but his son much rather awkwardly sing songs from Grease and be pestered by a random black girl (whose name is Plot Device) that challenges him to go to the Grease audition at the school, because she's his biggest rival or something. You NEVER SEE THIS AUDITION. It's only point is to drive home how clueless Tim Allen is at his son's gayness. Just another subplot in a movie that can't get the normal plot right. Why can't the son just not want to play football? I can understand the theme of a parent pushing a kid to do something they don't want to do (pageant parents), but why did they have to throw in character development for this stupid ass kid? He's awful.\n\nSo fast forward, Tim Allen is a bad dad (take a drink everytime he's a bad dad), the precious twat kids save the magical dog that escaped from the lab and the dog is an asshole and bites Tim Allen, because we're following SPIDERMAN RULES. After the bite from a radioactive spid...dog, we are treated to bad CGI of hairy germs taking over his blood cells, like we didn't already guess Tim Allen was going to turn into a fucking dog.\n\nSo instead of going to the hospital to get check out for RABIES (cause you know, you WERE bitten by a strange dog), he just goes to sleep. The audience is then assaulted with a sequence of scenes showing Tim Allen (the human) doing dog like things (sleeping at foot of bed, shoving face into bowl of cereal, growling in court). It's so ham fisted. Yet, how obvious this shit is, he has NO clue why he is acting strange. No seriously, not a clue. \n\nSide note: evil co guesstimated that the dog lives 7 years for every one year (like reverse dog years) but the dog is said to be 300 years old. But it doesn't...make sense? Does that math make sense? How does that work? Don't know why they included it. I can get behind a magical ever living dog...I guess. The more attention you bring to it, the more questions I have about it. As shit, now I have to ask these questions!\n\nSo there is no real backstory on the dog, which can be fine. Most people can accept that maybe this dog is just magical. But then they throw in this whole it's from Tibet and it's real name is Fuck This Movie (actually it was something like You R Phat or something). So...is this dog a dog? Or a human that turned into a dog? Did some monk master meditation and turned into the dog? The dog acts like a dog the whole time during the movie, UNTIL THE END, when you see the Tibet magic dog FUCKING SURFING A WAVE. So it can't just be a normal dog? Is it just a really hairy, short, Asian person? I thought maybe the dog would pass on this gene by biting, you know, passing the torch. I figured it was a human, who got turned into the dog and then he passes it on to another human. But this is way more thought than any of the seven or so screenwriters gave it, so fuck it.\n\nSo during all this shit, there is still a trial going on where Tim Allen has to prosecute the teacher...and then he does dog things in the court...and then Danny Glover (doing his best lethal weapon impersonation) tells him HE'S OFF THE CASE. Ahhh. That felt good. This movie is like a compilation of famous actors doing roles they did in much better movies. \n\nSo Tim Allen gets captured by evil co, Tony Stark injects the CEO with magic dog blood...which will knock him out for a few months and then when he wakes up, Stark will be the CEO and not him. THAT'S HOW THE MOVIE DESCRIBED IT. Then Tim Allen gets AQUAMAN powers and is able to talk to the fucked up animal monstrosities the lab had and they all escape.\n\nThis fucking movie blows. I'm wasting my time and wrists writing this. So they steal a car, he uses scrabble letters to tell his idiot family that the dog is him (hilarity also ensues as there are scenes of the old switch a roo, where the family thinks the magic dog is tim allen, but it's just a dog! so then they tell the magic dog to do stuff but it just sits there, and then the mom just sits there doing what she thinks is acting and staring at the dog with a slight look of confusion, or maybe constipation, and at one point she takes 3 seconds before she says her next line...and fuck).\n\nAlso, Tim Allen figures out you can go back to human if you sleep! or if you just  meditate enough! Fuck whatever.\n\nSo the most egregious part of this film is when Tim Allen gets stuck in traffic and he has to make it to court, he starts running and getting your heart beat up turns you into a dog, and he's running as a dog, then jumps off a building and says...\n\nTO INFINITY...AND BEYOND!\n\nFUCK YOU MOVIE. FUCK OFF. This movie can't stand by itself so it just steals from much better movies. FUCK THIS MOVIE.\n\nIn the end, Tim Allen bites Robert Downey Jr, tim allen questions the witness again (even though that's not how trials work, plus defensive council did not object to anything, plus never cross examined the witness which you are ALLOWED to do after the prosecution questions a witness...).....so after Tim Allen badgers the witness, JR does some dog stuff and people freak out and somehow that acquits the teacher from arson. THAT'S NOT HOW ANYTHING WORKS. Then he is immediately made the NEW DA (what happened to the old one?) then he immediately (off screen perhaps) books a trip to OAHU! NICE!\n\nThen we are transported to OAHU, where the family is watching that magical fucking dog catching a wave and the wife delivers the Oscar Winning Line of, \"I wish he didn't have to go back to Tibet\" O_O\n\nWHAT?! WHAT KIND OF LINE IS THAT? Plus, why the fuck DOES that dog have to go back to Tibet?! It's a fucking dog! The monks lost that dog for like weeks and they didn't give a flying fuck about him. Plus, they apparently are not concerned that a dog is RIDING A FUCKING WAVE. \n\nFUCK YOU MOVIE. I guess there was a tender moment where Tim Allen did tell his obviously gay son that he was okay with whatever he wanted to be. That was nice, I suppose. But then again, if he wasn't okay with it, it would just prove how BAD OF A DAD HE WAS (DRINK DRINK DRINK!)\n\nOverall, this movie could be categorized as something between a rock and a hard place, if that rock was made of a steaming pile of shit, and a hard place was a landfill full of steaming piles of shit.This movie physically hurt me. \n\nI understand these movies aren't supposed to be original. This movie is supposedly for kids. Yet, we've seen that you can make a movie that both kids and adults can enjoy (or kids enjoy and adults ball their eyes out over, I'm looking at you UP and Toy Story 3). But this doesn't even work for kids. If it's for kids, why all the sub plots? Why not more goofy dog CGI hijinx? It's just shit.\n\nBTW, the director, Brian Robbins, just directs garbage. He's directed this, Norbit, Meet Dave, Thousand Words...just plain bad movies.\n\nEven if you are in the mood for a bad movie, just skip this one. It's much too painful.",

            "content": "Terrible. The real problem with this movie is not that it was bad, but that it panders way too much to the audience. You know those moments in movies that you don't want to happen, but in order for the movie to be good those moments need to be in there? Those moments have a name and in this case they needed something called dramatic irony. It's where we the audience gets what's going on, but the characters don't yet. A great example of this would be like in Romeo and Juliet. Juliet has just taken a sleeping potion, romeo thinks that she's dead and because he thinks that he commits suicide because he can't live without her. One good example of dramatic irony in this movie would have been that that they had found out Tim Allen was the dog at the final trial. But instead the characters were much smarter than they should have been and found out before the final trial started. There were so many good places they could have used the dramatic irony tool in this movie, but they were either too stupid to put them in or they were too afraid of displeasing the audience. And maybe we don't want to be pleased. Alfred Hitchcock even said this at one point in his life: \"Always make the audience suffer as much as possible.\" Admittedly there are some movies that are meant to please us like The Avengers for instance, but that formula works for the superhero genre not for this. Although if you want to be worshipped like a god by everyone who worked on this movie then by all means watch it.",
