But, if on the contrary, you have a mind of your own, and couldn't care less for designer labels, and all the trendiness of a certain group of people, then this is a movie you might not enjoy. Even as the Marchetta girls keep getting poorer by the minute, they seem to have a knack for pulling the right outfits to go with their new impoverished state! One was curious as to what attracted Martha Coolidge, its director, to such paper thin material. She has done better with other movies, so we were surprised to see her at the helm of this project which will not add anything to her resume. As far as the acting goes, this movie will not win any awards, that's for sure. Even Angelica Huston, an actress of excellent taste seems to be asking to herself, \"What am I doing in this piece of $#%%^%\"!",

            "content": "Material Girls reviewed by Sam Osbornrating: 1 out of 4There's a moment in Material Girls when the infinitely wise and humble lawyer at the Free Legal Clinic bears down on the equally infinite stupidity of Ava Marchetta (Haylie Duff) and coolly snarls, \"you're all frosting, without the cupcake.\" Granted, this one-liner is of no great wit or intelligence it does hold a kind of all-encompassing truth about Material Girls. Except, in saying Material Girls has as much density as a cupcake's frosting is probably giving the film a world of credit it has no business deserving. The gimmick of Material Girls is in the Duff sisters. Whatever film photographed behind them on the film's posters is immaterial. For all we care, this could be Hong Kong Kung Fu Fury, just as long as it stars the Duff sisters. So in the same way people go to see Snakes on a Plane just to see some actual snakes on an actual plane, people will go see Material Girls only to watch they're adolescent idols bouncing and hopping and giggling about in front of the camera. The quality of the film behind them is irrelevant; just a prettily painted canvas for a blonde hullabaloo. But for all those parents goaded into bringing their ten-year old daughter, I suppose a synopsis is appropriate. Ava and Tanzie Marchetta (Haylie and Hilary Duff) are the faces of Marchetta Facial Products. They're glistening socialites in the vane world inhabited in reality by Paris Hilton and her partying cohorts\u0096minus the sex tapes. They're father, Victor Marchetta, passed away two years earlier and the company will soon be left in the girls' hands. But when a cut-rate newscaster breaks a scandal on Marchetta products causing cancer, the girls' stock plummets and they're left, gasp, without their credit cards. The girls must unite and disprove the accusations in order to save the image of their father. In the process of course, Ava and Tanzie must learn humility and sincerity through the conduit of their loss of funds and fortune. Director Martha Coolidge stumbles in her approach to the material. The film's intention bounces between parody and sentimentality. Sometimes it strives to ooze sympathy for its ditzy protagonists and rolls out the morals by the bushel. But other times, Coolidge ravages her characters with a volley of farcical gags. There's a happy middle-ground between the two intentions that a better director would likely find: where the believably clueless socialites learn to interact with the similarly convincing world of middle-class American society. But Coolidge veers more towards the feel of a sitcom, sans laugh-track. Without it, the jokes fall flat. Neither of the Duffs have a sense of comic timing and the screenplay doesn't bother with helping them along. Material Girls is so woefully unfunny that not even the heaps of twelve-year girls could be heard laughing. Just before the film started, I mistimed my restroom break and admittedly missed the opening minute or two of the movie. I asked my girlfriend, who'd been kind enough to sit through its entirety, what I'd missed afterwards in that opening minute. She explained it to me and I felt a deep sympathy for her. She was subjected to two more minutes of Material Girls, and the thought of any more torture was physically painful to me. That's essentially the effect Material Girls has: it is physically painful to endure. -www.samseescinema.com",

The Duff sisters are normally bearable (i loved A Cinderella Story and Raise Your Voice), in this, they weren't. I think there were about 10 people in the theater, and about 2 people laughing at the \"jokes\". I suggest not seeing this. Unless you can see it for free. Even then, maybe you should think about it... I want my hour and 40 minutes back. And my money. Kids might enjoy it... but none of the kids in the theater i went to were really acting like they liked it. So i can't tell you for sure.",

I heard this was written for the Olsen Twins, and they turned it down. I've seen New York Minute. If the Olsens turned it down, you have to be dumb or desperate to sign up, cuz it's gonna be bad. Hilary and Haley oughta get strung up for this. What a waste of talent. Maybe they'll do a horror flick and it'll happen, and then we can forgive them for swinging so low (no pun intended.) Let us pray to the movie gods for something good, soon. Please.But for now...somebody go get a rope.",

It seemed more like a movie done between the Duff sisters for fun. You could tell they were acting, not very believable. I'm one of the people who don't normally notice these things too! The plot wasn't that unique and it was so short with nothing really happening, and it was predictable. Yuck! I'm sure they had fun making it, but I didn't have fun watching it. And I don't think anyone else in the theater did either, instead when it FINALLY ended everyone just kinda hurried out of their in silence (nothing good to talk about).

            "content": "Hilary Duff and her sister Haylie shine as sparkling young cubic zirconium professional heiresses. They have everything their bleached blonde little hearts could ever want, until OH NOES someone said mean things about their dear dead daddy, who just happened to be a cosmetics mogul in life. So, OH NOES, their feelings are hurt and their stocks go down and all in all they lose about a million bucks out of a hundred million. The people responsible for this piece of garbage obviously realized that not every pre-teen girl who saw this film would be quite as stupid as the characters in it, and therefore would not be inclined to feel any sympathy for the poor little bimbos, and so to make sure that our heart strings were successfully twanged, they burned down the girls' house, had their car stolen, and had all their friends abandon them. Actually, the girls burnt their own house down by setting fire to their makeup, and they gave their car keys to a couple of men who weren't actually valets. Oh, how I sobbed for their loss. I really sympathize more with their friends, fair-weather as they may be, who I saw as very intelligent rats who were finally blessed with an excuse to desert a sinking ship.The girls decide that dear daddy couldn't have done all those mean things he was accused of(creating makeup that causes face-rotting cancer)and set out to prove it. They enlist the help of a hunky young lab technician and a hunky young attorney to clear daddy's name, and set out on a adventure fraught with peril(public transportation)and hardship(having nothing to wear).This movie might have been tolerable, perhaps even enjoyable, if it had not been for one major factor: the characters have no real motive for anything they do. The girls aren't threatened with destitution, they're about to make millions off of the sale of their company. They have all the money they could ever want, but it isn't enough for them. They want it all, and they get it all. They end up right back where they started, with all the money, clothes, friends, makeup, and teacup chihuahuas they weren't actually in any danger of losing.The film tries very, very hard to provide the characters with some deeper motivation. They're not fighting for the spare change they lost over the scandal, no, they're fighting to clear their father's name! They're not throwing a tantrum over hurt feelings, they're standing up for themselves! The movie tries, so very, very hard, to show the girls learning some lesson about humility or responsibility or some other such teen movie drabble, and it fails completely. Both girls get all their money and their boys, and the movie comes across as a taunt to the audience. A sort of \"Ha ha, we're so cool. Don't you wish you could be cool like us? Let's go get manicures! And after that, shoes!\" message. In the end, this film might entertain Paris Hilton, but the rest of us are left wondering why today's society encourages this type of behavior, and more importantly, why we wasted 97 minutes of our time watching this film.",

            "content": "First let me say that I like the Duff sisters, so I was not looking to hate this movie. In fact, we own Hilary's previous movies on DVD and I figured we'd eventually own this one too. Now that I've seen (\"wasted money on\" is another way to say it) this movie, I can tell you I will not ever buy this and will never watch this again.The only reason I gave this a one instead of a two is that I genuinely like the Duff sisters. I was looking forward to a movie that my daughter would like and I would enjoy, if not just tolerate. I think the sisters should fire their agents, advisers, producers, or whoever put them up to this. It did nothing to enhance their careers. And I'm still not sure who they thought their audience is. Certainly no adults would (or should) choose to see this movie if they weren't going for their daughters, but neither was this movie properly aimed at young girls (the Duffs' main fan base.) As far as the PG rating, I am not a prude - I actually own Mean Girls, and I am fairly liberal about what my children watch (e.g., we love Friends, even though others think the material is not always appropriate for kids) but I squirmed in my seat for the moms that had younger children in the audience, as well as for my 11 year old daughter. Without going into detail - no spoilers - there were blatant references to adultery, gang banging, and sex that I did not think appropriate at all. There was some foul language. There was outright prejudice against all sorts of people. Referencing an earlier review, yes the comment was about \"I Love Lucy\" and not a Hispanic nanny, but nonetheless, annoying anyway.Most importantly, the movie was mindless, and it didn't have to be. The Duff sisters aside, there were some genuinely talented people in the cast (Anjelica Huston, Maria Conchita Alonso) but the script was so bad that there was no saving this movie. There was a shot at redemption near the end, but the screenwriters blew that too. (How do these things even become movies?) It's almost as if the creators know that this movie won't last but a nano-second in history, as evidenced by the constant mainstream references and advertising plugs. Technically, there was bad continuity (Check out Hilary's hairstyles - in the beginning there is one scene where her french braid magically disappears with a camera angle change; or the lips moving out of sequence with the dialogue)and the jarring special effects editing were distracting and juvenile.Like the characters themselves, this movie is all form with no substance.",

It may be a little silly but at the end of the day its a lighthearted movie with a good message. The Duff sisters acting talent has to be commended. Hilary acting like I have never seen her before. She is no longer acting a little goodie-girl but has made the transition into an adult who is a lot of fun to watch on screen. The elder Duff, Haylie, also has to be mentioned for her great acting skills and humour. Over all a likable movie with a moral which is worth seeing.",

Although it is interesting for me to see that the soundtrack is also done by the sisters. This is no coincidence of course. Hilary in real life is a hard working person for her career, which reminds me of her character in this material girls film. This movie reminds me of Madonna's song material girl.

            "content": "OK so Material girls is awful. It's bland, redundant, silly, clich\u00e9d but strangely likable. There is just nothing right about this movie. It's all wrong., but it's very likable like it's two stars. Hilary and Haylie Duff are not good actresses by any stretch but they have that something that makes them popular. Barely retaining any talent they managed to stay in the spotlight. As for the movie it's about two sisters that are heads of their late fathers Cosmetics company they're socialites and referred to as the Marscheta sisters. Overnight a scandal takes place and bankrupts their entire company. Leaving them on their own to fend for themselves. There is of course the obligatory corny romances Hilary with hottie Columbo and Haylie with geeky but endearing Haas. Huston plays the villain the head of Fabiella cosmetics looking to buy their company. Although she really isn't much of a villain and Spiner of TV's Star Trek (Data) stars as their chummy trustee. The film works as you would think it would. There is nothing especially surprising about it. Except that it's just a bit more grown up of a film than you might usually expect from Hilary Duff. You'll finally recognize that her body has filled out and she's not afraid to flaunt it, especially her upper half. Recently she became quite emaciated but has filled out since than and looks healthy and good, very good. And there is a strange prison lesbian scene with Hilary it's all there upping the awfulness and yet adding to the likability as well. This is a strange movie when it does everything wrong but you just can't hate it. Martha Coolidge directed this likable mess and it's a far cry from her much better but slightly muddled Prince and me. So yes I found myself disappointed, but not by much. It's kind of what I expected. there was minimal advertisisng and not a big push for the film. But hey I liked it, I think...**1/2 (out of four) ????",

On the other Hand,these kind of movies, don't make a better opinion for them. It's actually more bashing for blonde's (and teens) that they express the dumbness to a exponential level(Women can't do anything,trusts anybody(even local thugs),can't cook,wash,etc). Brainless people who actually defends the Duff's for \"Masterpieces\" like this, should be more worried about their own problems.Jealousy? For what? What they have done for me to worry about them?

Blithely oblivious to anything outside their cocoon of comfort, Tanzie (Hilary) and Ava Marchetta (Haylie) devote themselves to partying frequently and dressing fashionably when they're not occupied with minimal duties as the ubiquitous \"faces\" for the eponymous cosmetics firm founded by their late father.For most of the first half-hour or so, the Marchetta sisters come across as insufferable ditzes, even during their random acts of noblesse oblige. (When a worshipful underling compliments Tanzie's dress, Tanzie beams brightly and responds: \"Thank you. Maybe when I'm finished with it, I'll give it to you.\")After a tabloid TV reporter (Henry Cho) breaks the news that Marchetta products may have disfiguring side effects, the company's stock nosedives, corporate assets are frozen -- and the sisters become social pariahs. So...Tanzie and Ava set out to clear their father's name (and reclaim their father's fortune) by disproving the reports of disfiguring side effects. A bad situation gets appreciably worse when, thanks to their own dim-wittedness, Tanzie and Ava manage to burn down their mansion and lose their expensive car. They wind up having to rely on the hospitality of their former maid (Maria Conchita Alonso) while trying to master the working-class routine of riding the bus, applying for jobs and doing really, really gross things like washing dishes.While doing so, each sibling acquires her very own romantic interest: a pro bono lawyer (Lukas Haas) for Ava, a hunky lab assistant (Marcus Coloma) for Tanzie.My Opinion: I haven't watched anything that is more dumbly lacking in subtlety. Never. Stupid, meaningless plot, crap acting, racist comments and so many more negative things. Frankly movies like Material Girls sicken me. Although I wasn't expecting anything more intelligent or professional, because of the fact that it got only a 2.0(How embarrassing!)and I don't like Hil or her sister at all, my friend still dragged me to the theaters.

Subplots appeared out of nowhere and dropped out without explanation.

When it begins, you learn that the pair are cosmetics company owners and are paid incredibly well to look pretty and hang out in the places where hip and pretty people go.

Later, the pair lose all their money and supposedly learn something and grow.So is this any good? No...which isn't any surprise. Most of the problem is that the script is artless and not particularly good....and making the sisters so selfish and awful was a serious mistake. Whether they ever grew up or learned anything really didn't matter to me....and the same is probably true for most viewers. The folks around them, also, are mostly hollow and worthless individuals. Overall, it all comes off as a vanity project...one that just didn't seem to work and which could have used a massive re-write. And, one that has very limited appeal. Perhaps girls 12-14 might like it...but who else?",

Why? because much like tinfoil and shiny things lure in pack rats, this kind of movie, with its overdose of fashion, diamonds, and corny one-liners draws in the pack rat audience, mostly comprising of 8 year old girls. (no offense) But while I would give it a low rating for that, this movie is even lower, because not even the story is original. If any of you out there are Disney channel lovers(like me!)you will know what I am talking about. As we flip through the endless list of Disney channel original movies,from corny to amazing to just plain bad,we come upon one movie. Cowbelles, made earlier this year, stars Aly and AJ as two rich, spoiled sisters who are made to work by their father after he loses his money made through his dairy factory. Sound familiar? Yeah I thought so. Both movies are pack rat movies, bursting to the seams with exurbanite fashion and huge amounts of bling,screaming, and shopping trips. they both also feature a common theme, that it is always good to work for your money, and after enduring some minor hardships, they come out changed people. they also come out with hot boy toys, and a \"greater sense of the world\". My summary? Material Girls is simply a badly made, copycat, pack rat movie that should stay at the back of the movie closet.",

There was some very true statements on having to adjust and recognize the things about yourself that aren't always good. And true to form the girls had to adjust every day as they continued to learn.

For example when the sisters go on a bus, and in the trailer the bus driver says it will be $1.35 and then Haylie Duff says that she isn't tipping him till she knows how good his service is, well in the movie, they get on the bus, the bus driver holds them back, Haylie says her line, and then the bus driver says how much it costs.

In the emotional scene near the beginning, where the two sisters are sitting are their father's \"memorial\" testimonial dinner, Hillary looks as though she is really crying! While Haylie just looks like she has indigestion.There are some funny scenes in this movie. The scene where the two girls take the bus for the first time is really priceless. They don't even know that you have to pay money to ride the bus!

Her sister is too, so they both get the price, Britney Spears in Crossroads deserved to win an Oscar compared to this two. 4.- Their characters are so silly, that thought like come on, rich girls are not THAT stupid, and assuming that most rich girls are kinda stupid you should guess what the THAT means. 5.- The movie is racist. 6.- The Duffs playing the Olsens 7.- Good Charlotte was in it.In Conclusion, this movie for me was like an offense for humanity in general. there's just not people so stupid like those in the movie.",

Now, when my 17 year old daughter was very little, she LOVED Hilary Duff and I thought that Hilary had a very nice singing voice and was MUCH more of a positive role model than many of the other \"tween pop\" artists out there and I had also seen her on the Lizzy Maguire series and thought she was just adorable. So, while this movie is not some sort of \"cinematic tour de force\" it is definitely fun, lighthearted, and something very easy to watch when you are not feeling well. I quite enjoyed it and have watched it several times since.

IMDb users slammed it even harder than critics, sending it reeling into the Bottom 100 within days of its first showing. Studios could at least bank on preteen girls with allowance money\u0085right? Um, wrong. At its widest release, it was in 1,509 theaters\u0085and, apparently, those 1,509 theaters were in areas not populated by preteen girls. The movie grossed a dismal $11.4 million and, though I could not find its production budget, given its two pricey leads, I would say that this was probably a financial disaster. So, you can imagine my excitement (or lack thereof) when my copy of the DVD arrived and it was time for me to screen it. I expected a horrible mess of a movie\u0085so imagine my surprise when I discovered that \"Material Girls\" is *gasp* not that bad.Tanzie (Hilary Duff) and Ava (Haylie Duff) Marchetta are the faces of Marchetta Cosmetics, not to mention the daughters of its recently-deceased founder. They have never worked a day in their life and have always been very, very wealthy. But, with their father dead and their mother off in Europe, they have no help when a scandal explodes. A television program claims that there was a string of people who were permanently disfigured by Marchetta cosmetics and, suddenly, Tanzie and Ava find themselves out on their butts. When they accidentally burn down their apartment and their car is stolen, Tanzie and Ava only have one person to turn to: their former maid, Inez (Alonso) who takes them in and gives them a place to stay. The sisters know that something is wrong about the scandal and begin an investigation to discover what really caused the disfigurements on the people and who would want Marchetta Cosmetics to suffer? Could it be their arch nemesis, Fabiella (Huston) or one of the many greedy business executives who would stab anyone in the back for a quick buck?Hilary Duff is often criticized for her acting abilities. In fact, most people would say that there is no reason at all for her to even be famous\u0085or even be acting whatsoever. In my opinion, she has just never had the right role. She is certainly not the most dynamic actress working today, but, if given the proper opportunity, I think she could really prove herself. \"Material Girls\" is not that role. It is pretty much the same thing she has done before. She does fine, but I just really want her to break out and prove that she is worthy of her fame. Haylie Duff is much like her sister. She has talent, but has never had an outlet to prove it. And, much like Hilary, she doesn't find one here. She too does fine. Anjelica Huston is such a great actress and always gives good performances, but why does she waste her time in movies like these? She could do so much better. She gives yet another good performance, but only truly succeeds in proving that she is above these types of films.I should have hated \"Material Girls\". It should have fallen directly to the bottom of my \"Bottom 10\" list and I should be using such words as \"Horrible\", \"Dreadful\", and \"Garbage\" to describe it. Everything about this movie screamed, \"Hollywood Drivel!\" However, when everything was said and done and the end credits rolled, my very first thought was, \"It was cute.\" It is indeed a cute movie. It works on a basic level and is actually quite funny. However, it is a very flawed film. First and foremost, the entire plot is so implausible. None of this would ever happen. On top of that, the romances the two girls just happen to wander into are both half-baked and aren't realistic at all. The ending is painfully predictable. I didn't even realize they were planning for it to be a big surprise until the \"Big Reveal\". But, I enjoyed this movie. Now, I am, by no means, running out and buying it. I won't be renting it again, but, if it is ever on television, I would probably watch it. It isn't nearly as bad as everyone is saying and does not deserve its place on IMDb's Bottom 100.Final Thought: \"Material Girls\" is far better than critics and most IMDb users say.Overall Rating: 6/10 (B)",

There are parts played by Hilary Duff that I would have never seen her play. Like the part when she dressed up like julia roberts(mini skirt and a push up bra haha) in order to get paperwork that she needed to solve the case. Haylie's role was good too very sassy and controlling. The guys were just perfect they were the cherry on the cake to make the movie perfect! No matter what the old guy critics say (which is just their opinion) this movie was really good and I recommend it! PLUs there's hilarious bloopers in the end!!! it was soo funny!",

She has a drop dead gorgeous face and a pretty good smile. Not to mention they boot in two hot guys. Material Girls has a plot almost familiar to us all because I think they could have been almost predictable. If they could add in some bizarre moments in between, it would have been beyond memorable. Not Hillary's best definitely, but worth a watch for those who are just too bored and need some romance to spice up their life. Not recommended though to those who loves action, thriller and will easily feel sleepy when watching a boring movie.",

I am a DataGrrl and that's what I hope to stay.If you're thinking about renting this movie because Brent Spiner is in it, it's worth the money. Pretty eyes. Very pretty eyes. And he dyed his hair brown again, which is very nice (although nowhere near mandatory).The movie itself is rather pedestrian. I wouldn't have a problem showing it to children maybe between twelve and fourteen. Relatively neutral to positive messages about homosexuality and the main characters are very self-directed. The love between the sisters (Hilary and Haylie Duff) is apparent and clear, even in the scenes where they're supposed to be \"fighting\". If you're going to press me to be honest, I'd have to say that the movie needs to come with a warning against operating heavy machinery while viewing. If you don't want your kids to see it, feel free to assure them that they're not missing anything.But if you're thinking of renting or buying this movie for the Brent Spiner angle, again, IT'S WORTH IT. If only for the short shot of his skinny-but-sweet legs. And his pretty, pretty eyes (really. Truly gorgeous).",

            "content": "Reviewer Bias: Loves Hilary Duff \"Material Girls\" is not horrible, but not great either. It is not anywhere near the worst film, but it will not be pining for an Oscar either. Viewers need to understand this movie isn't trying to be a deeply moving, sweeping, comedy epic. It is just a light film trying to entertain and get a few laughs, and does so successfully.Ava and Tanzie Marchetta are empty headed but nevertheless celebrated socialites, and the head of the Marchetta cosmetic company. Their world is torn out from under their feet when a scandal erupts, leaving them with nothing.Hilary and Haylie deliver comical, over the top performances as Ava and Tanzie. The fun they had creating these characters and taking them over the top is evident on screen. Angelica Houstan delivers a solidly delicious performance as Fabiella. The emotion of the movie comes in large part from Inez, the house keeper as the girls realize she truly cares about them and wants them to succeed.Much of the humor of the film comes from idiotic sincerity of Ava and Tanzie as they try to adjust to a \"normal\" way of life, such as when Tanzie gripes about not getting unemployment money and argues that she should get more, having never been employed. Hilary's line about what happens on public buses is one of the funniest in the whole movie and Haylie shows a different side in the more dramatic moments in the movie. Director Martha Coolidge adds a style and flair to the picture that otherwise could have been a disaster.This movie could have been better if it showed more of the girls' change of heart at the end of the movie. There should have also been more of a sense of panic as the scandal goes down. More time should have been spent showing the change of the girls at the end instead of finding clues in the middle.This movie isn't great, but it is entertaining and humorous and worth a rental.",

You laugh, you feel bad but in the end it works out in a cool way.. Seriously see this movie! Hilary Duff should continue taking on good roles, and develop to be a better actress, (even though shes really good) because she could totally be huge one day.

In this movie, we don't find out who's the villain until the end.Personally I like movies with happy endings, not just \"happy\" but where they become better people.The only real negative is that Haylie's character seem to jump back and forth between cutting their losses and saving their father's reputation with no middle ground",

It was simply not 'Mean Girls' or Paris Hilton in 'The Simple Life'.It's a very good movie for middle school girls and a terrible movie for teenage girls who are used to much more mature content. I don't believe there is even any objectionable language in this movie. Miraculous!As usual, the commentary by director Martha Coolidge made it much more enjoyable to view the second time around.Haylie Duff and Hilary Duff are luscious and it seems they can't wear anything that doesn't look fabulous on them. They are the much smarter, more beautiful, more sophisticated Olsen twins, if such a comparison is needed.Acting-wise, Haylie Duff is capable of projecting such warmth that I'm not surprised she ended up on 'Seventh Heaven' playing the one-dimensional role of the unwed-mother-turned-Divinity-Student.Hilary Duff can act also but let's face it, these two are more beautiful to look at, no matter whether they are in a photograph or on the screen.The script to this movie doesn't offer much memorable dialogue. It still doesn't matter; the movie's a light bit of fluff when you are tired of watching suspense, drama, cynical comedy and soft-porn.What I enjoyed most: seeing Maria Conchita Alsonso, Angelica Houston and of all people, Faith Prince, in this film.

            "content": "Material Girls begins ghastly enough. After an opening title sequence that introduces cosmetic heiresses Ava (Haylie Duff) and Tanzie Marchetta (Hilary Duff) while Hilary Duff adds an updated spin on Madonna's pop classic \"Material Girl,\" the action quickly opens on the type of Hollywood party familiar to anyone who keeps up with the comings and goings of Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton. In other words, it's a soiree for the young, rich, celebrated, and spoiled. Cut to the next day, where the girls are revealed as basically good-hearted but shallow, condescending, and if not outright stupid, at least completely ignorant when it comes to the real world. In these first minutes, The Simpleton Life seems like a more apt title for this movie. Luckily, it gets better. Not that the Duff sisters or director Martha Coolidge should be expecting any nominations come awards time, but as a piece of fluffy entertainment, it goes down painlessly enough. Mothers of the tween target audience will recognize the outlines of the story, which is a non-supernatural variation of 1987's Maid to Order (itself a teen comedy variation on It's a Wonderful Life). That movie starred Ally Sheedy as a spoiled rich kid whose fairy godmother transforms her into a servant to teach her a lesson. Material Girls is more mundane, as a scandal involving Ava and Tanzie's late father's cosmetics company renders them penniless and miserable\u0097their assets are frozen, and overnight they're turned into social pariahs. This is one of those movies where the trappings of wealth are simultaneously held up as objects to covet and ridicule, a Cinderella fantasy where Cinderella has to pay dearly for that ride in the pumpkin coach. As their friends desert them and Ava's TV star fianc\u00e9 dumps her, the sisters get a painful lesson on just how superficial their lives have been. Circling around them like a shark is Fabiella (Anjelica Huston), their dad's rival, who is hoping to pick up the Marchetta company on the cheap. Only their Colombian housekeeper, Inez (Maria Conchita Alonso), stands by them, but even she has to roll her eyes at Ava and Tanzie's self-absorption and naivet\u00e9. Without status or money, these young things could easily become life's roadkill. The clash between the fantasy world that has been their birthright and the reality that's crashing down on their heads is, of course, what generates the laughs. Riding the bus, washing dishes, ironing\u0097all become mysteries to solve while they work surreptitiously to clear their father's name and save the company. Not that the movie is all life lessons and Scooby Doo moments. One thing that surprises the siblings as they move down market is the quality of the men they meet, as pro bono lawyer Henry (Lukas Haas) and lab technician Rick (Marcus Colonna) prove to be not only hot, but actually helpful. Hilary Duff was TV's sweet Lizzie McGuire, while Haylie recently has had a recurring role as a single mom on the family drama 7th Heaven, so it is not surprising that what Material Girls offers is pretty wholesome entertainment. Ava and Tanzie are ultimately charming once they have gotten their comeuppance. And while it just seems wrong that actors of the pedigree of Huston, Alonso, and Haas should find themselves reduced to playing second banana to the Duff sisters, their presence and their excellent performances add a layer of quality that the movie would otherwise lack. There is no edge to the movie at all, and that blandness will render it forgettable to anyone over the age of 12 or so, but for all that, it is pleasant enough, and occasionally even fun.Well, It's Worth A Rent, If you want a family film.",

The acting is horrible (which Hilary Duff acts the same in all her movies so expect that).. There are some extremely irritating parts, like when Tanzie goes into the news station office and needs to get to the files, it was a rip off of Erin Brockovich and is poorly done. Tanzie also acts like a bimbo in the beginning and then MAGICALLY knows all about chemistry and the making of their products, which is a far stretch..And the ending could have been written by a 13 year old for an English assignment. All in all I gave it a 3 for being as it describes in the summary, EH !",

I watched it again the next day to really see how I felt about the movie, but it just made it seem worse. I myself was not in love with the movie.

I wouldn't go as far as to say i loved it, but it was fairly enjoyable, and i don't agree when some folk say its only for young kids. All in all, an enjoyable but unsubstantial movie.

And Its So Funny. My Favorite Line is when tanzie and Ava are getting in the bus and then Ava(Haylie Duff) says \"I'm not tipping you until I know how good your service is\". And when it comes to DVD by the way its coming on December 12 2006. I'm so buying it. And I recommend everyone to buy it. Be a Proud member of MGILSG (Material Girls is like so good)",

Sure it may have had some rude comments in it but that's what the movie was about. Two rich girls who were discovering that there is more to life then money, clothes, and shopping.

            "content": "When I tell people that I watch any type of film, I really do mean it. Though I am a guy, I'm certainly not above watching chick flicks. However, that being said, chick flicks have also given me some of the worst film-watching experiences I've ever had that still scar me years after watching them. Sometimes I even shudder as I recall the experiences of watching them.\n\nI know there are female viewers that try to say that these films are escapist entertainment, much like what us guys watch when it comes to action films or gross out comedies, but even the stupidest of those films still have some level of respect for their viewers, even if it is rather minimal at times. With a film like Material Girls, it has no respect for its viewers. It views its audience as a bunch of prissy, whiny, stupid, glamor-obsessed girls with roughly the same brain cell count as a cardboard box, while throwing in a half-assed moral message that means nothing in the end.\n\nIt's a film that thinks if it sticks popular (At the time, of course) preteen icons for girls into a film, fashion, annoying pop music, romantic cliches so lazy you'll want to vomit, pop culture references, and a gamut of other things that plague chick flicks, that it can just get away with being a piece of shit because of its \"target audience\" which is quite shameful. Oh no, Material Girls, I'm not letting you get away.\n\nSisters Tanzie and Ava (Real-life sisters, Hilary and Haylie Duff) are two rich girls who spend all their time partying and shopping, as they inherited their late father's cosmetics company, even though they do nothing to help run it. They are simply riding on the cash flow from the company.\n\nBut, Tanzie still dearly misses her father, even watching an old TiVo recording of him promoting his cosmetics every now and then and refusing to erase it, despite pressures from her sister to do so.\n\nBut one day, their lives are turned upside down when a tabloid program claims that the company's cosmetic products cause terrible skin conditions, threatening to destroy the company, causing their assets to be frozen, having an angry mob after them, and losing all of their so-called \"friends\" in the process.\n\nWhile at home in their mansion, with an angry mob outside their gates, a fire is accidentally started, burning down their mansion and forcing them to stay with their maid, since their credit cards are no longer active and they can't stay anywhere else. They are now homeless, broke, jobless, and completely clueless as they have no idea how the outside works from their insular rich bubble of a world.\n\nBut, there is a ray of hope for the girls when a rival cosmetics company offers to buy their company for several million dollars. But, Tanzie refuses the deal, and decides to start an investigation into what is really going on at their company since she believes that they were framed, resulting in a series of supposed-to-be-funny shenanigans along the way as they investigate.\n\nI do enjoy a good comedy about high society or takedowns of rich people (Including celebrities), but Material Girls is horribly dissatisfying in its storytelling. Even by the most minimum standards of chick flicks, this storyline is vacant and hollow, doing only the bare minimum to have a story and one-note characters so that it can be considered a film. There was absolutely no effort or care put into the storyline. This is easily one of the most lazily-written films I've ever seen. The average viewer, even if they possess no writing abilities of any sort, could write a script that would look Oscar-worthy in comparison to this script.\n\nThe two lead characters are nothing but two spoiled, bratty bitches, while the Tanzie character only has the minute elements of being a semi good girl sort of character who is also slightly smarter than her very dim-witted sister, Ava. I never rooted for them and I never cared, even when their characters seemed to become smarter and learned how to be semi-normal people.\n\nEven with cast members like Anjelica Huston and Brent Spiner (Who also appeared in another horrible comedy, The Master Of Disguise. Were things really so bad after they stopped making Star Trek films for awhile?), the script does absolutely nothing with them, outside of simple caricatures, being possible lame villains, or red herrings in the story's abominable insertion of mystery elements that makes even the most generic of mystery films look masterful by comparison.\n\nIt also has absolutely nothing insightful to say about rich people, high society, regular life, clearing one's name from a false accusation, or anything all together. It's all about following two air-headed tarts who aren't even funny or interesting air-headed tarts (I should have Romy And Michele's High School Reunion again instead. Now that was a funny film about air-headed tarts).\n\nThe acting is horrible across the board. As much as I disliked A Cinderella Story, in which Hilary Duff was the lead star, I felt that she gave a good performance in that film and showed signs of being far more capable than what that film would lead the viewer to believe. Unfortunately, that aura is definitely not present in this film. Here, Hilary Duff is just annoying, though at least she's more tolerable than her sister. I'm not sure what sort of acting abilities Haylie Duff might possess, but she was beyond bad in this film. Together, they're both just annoying tarts that began to grate on my nerves within less than two minutes of watching this abomination.\n\nAnjelica Huston is shamefully wasted and her presence is practically nonexistent, though she is probably the best actress of the bunch by doing another bitchy sort of performance, which was mildly entertaining at times. No other cast members are worth noting, other than expressing sadness over seeing the decline of Brent Spiner's career.\n\nEntertainment? What entertainment? This film is so hollow and vacant, that even viewers with the most minimum standards for chick flicks will be hard-pressed to find anything of value in this film. It has only the most shallow elements of storytelling, characters so one-dimensional they are one step away from just being cardboard cutouts, horrible and unfunny jokes, and horrible acting. There is nothing to derive from this film other than brief moments of Anjelica Huston's performance which can be momentarily entertaining to watch.\n\nHumor? Are you fucking kidding me? For comedies I usually try to have an extra paragraph to dedicate to humor, but there is not one positive thing that I can say about the humor. There are no funny parts.\n\nMaterial Girls is a horrible film that has only a single redeeming quality thanks only to Anjelica Huston's performance. Other than her, there is nothing of value to find, even if you have even the most shallow of standards for this type of film. Avoid it at all costs if you want to keep your sanity intact.",

When I saw it on the cheap at a yard sale, I decided to pick it up; I figured it would be easy, lighthearted entertainment for car trips.  I started it about a month or so ago, and finished it tonight; you may think I wouldn't remember what happened during my first viewing, but not only do I not find any entertainment forgettable, this movie didn't have anything close to a convoluted plot.  So, what did I think of the actual movie? It was good in some ways, and not in others.  The plot was cute, and the ending was a bit of a surprise.  The actors did a great job, and it was awesome to see \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" alum Brent Spiner play someone/something other than Data the humanoid android.  However, a higher use of profanity than I was expecting, as well as some crude remarks and immodest outfits, threw some serious grime into the mix.  One scene where Hilary Duff's character attempts to seduce a night watchman, and is thought to be a prostitute because of her skimpy outfit, was quite egregious for a film of this nature.  For those reasons, I couldn't recommend this to anyone under ten, no matter how much he/she likes \"Lizzie McGuire\".  Even for older moviegoers, this is something that is only worth a rental; unless you're a die-hard fan of one or both of the Duff sisters, or \"Addams Family\" star Anjelica Hutson, this probably isn't something you'll pop in again and again.  In short: If you're over ten and looking for a cutesy, silly comedy/mystery that doesn't involve a murder, then this one is for you.",

Both of these Disney girls have branched out into music (and I like both of them {for their acting and music} - for those who haven't seen Cow Belles, I'm talking about Alison Michalka of Aly & AJ). Cow Belles is a sweet little movie in which two little rich girls lose their fortune and have to work in a factory to learn the value of money and friendship. Material Girls is the same movie basically, only not as sweet. Same plot, same type of characters, same moral. Nothing original here - almost a complete copy except in one, the father is alive and in this one, the father is dead. Both movies came out in 2006... I guess the saying is true: there is nothing new under the sun. Here, the acting is decent; the girls look great... worth a look, but keep your expectations toned down. \r\n\r\nYou wrote this on 10/3/08.",
