            "content": "Not saying this isn't an excellent film, it is just bluntly honest. I remember in English class in high school, we were learning about racism in the 60's, and how horrible it was. The worst part was that I am from a very racist town, unfortunately, and watching the beginning of the film terrified me because I felt like this world hadn't changed since I felt like I was living that film. Being one voice sometimes can either be helpful or get you into a lot of trouble.I didn't want to see this film again because of the awful situations I saw or heard of. Now, I am out on my own, and I had the chance to see the movie once again, and felt that I could see it. It's a terrific and very powerful movie that can get anyone to cry unbearably. It's not just the actors, but Gene and William's characters, I wanted to be just like them, they were able to stand up even though the many times of being knocked down and caring so much just to try to in some way save that town.I honestly feel that everyone should see this movie, it can change your life or make you look around and want to change things. I know this comment feels more like a lecture than a comment, but that's how much this movie got to me. I think we all can do something right in this world, it's just a matter or standing up. Even if this film isn't historically accurate, it's accurate enough to see how people treat other people. Hopefully, we will have a better future for generations to come.9/10",

            "content": "On June 21, 1964 three young men drove a CORE (Congress of Racial Equality) station wagon from Meridian to Longview, Mississippi. On the return trip to Neshoba County Deputy Sheriff Cecil Price arrested them for speeding. He jailed them in Philadelphia, MS. then finally released them a little after 10 p.m. and told them to leave town. A few miles outside of Philadelphia the deputy stopped their car again--this time after a wild chase--and turned them over to a group of Neshoba County Klansmen. Their bodies wouldn't be found until over a month later by FBI agents.That's the real story. Mississippi Burning is a close dramatization of it.I watched in both disgust and surprise. I was disgusted by the actions of the proud citizens of Mississippi and I was surprised to see actors that I new nothing about when the movie came out in 1989--the likes of Willem Dafoe, Frances McDormand (Three Billboards...), R. Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket), Michael Rooker (Merle from The Walking Dead), Frankie Faison (commissioner on The Wire), and Darius McCrary (Eddie Winslow on Family Matters). I was surprised, not in a bad way, but in a \"Whoa! He's in this?!\" way. Sure these names aren't A-listers but they are all familiar faces to me that I never knew culminated on a 1989 project.As for the movie itself, there was some creative license taken but it was very close to the real events. In fact, the FBI knew so much about the murders because one of their informants was with the guilty party. The movie does evoke strong feelings and it is unavoidable. How do you depict 1960's deep south without raising the hairs on the back of someone's neck? Because this movie wasn't a through-and-through tragedy there was a modicum of justice served. I thought all the actors did a good job (too good in fact in some cases) and the script was well written. I still file this movie under \"hard to watch\".",

            "review_title": "It helps to be wise in the ways and mores of Dixie",
            "content": "It's now a well documented fact that FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was convinced that the Civil Rights movement was somehow being directed from Moscow as part of the Communist conspiracy. As if anyone's struggle for equality needed outside direction. Hoover's bugging of Martin Luther King is legendary both for its lack of useful information to prove that thesis and for the titillation that King's indiscretions provided for certain people in power courtesy of J. Edgar.But when the murders of those two outside civil rights workers from New York City Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman happened the nation was shocked. First it was a missing persons case, then a homicide when the bodies were discovered. Public opinion forced the FBI and its director to take this seriously. And I have to say that when they did, the job was done.The names of the civil rights workers were not mentioned nor was the name of the young black kid who here was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. In real life James Morton was a voter registrar working with Goodman and Schwerner. That gave some dramatic license to the producers of Mississippi Burning to spin their own version of events. Given the redneck wall of silence that federal investigators had to deal with I'm not sure the spinning was too far from the truth.Willem Dafoe's portrayal of a button down FBI agent of the Hoover era rings real true. Hoover's own standards regarding appearance and behavior of his agents somewhat hampered law enforcement in certain fields. He had other foibles that have come down to us since his death in 1972, some real, some speculative. Dafoe just isn't getting the job done.Which brings us to Gene Hackman who is a former Mississippi sheriff and wise in the ways and mores of Dixie. When Dafoe gives him a free hand Hackman gets results even though like in real life these Ku Klux Klansmen could only be tried in federal court as no Mississippi state jury would have convicted these creatures. Hackman got a well deserved Oscar nomination for his performance. And it's a good thing that the ACLU wasn't looking to hard at Hackman's methods. It was like what Sean Connery taught Kevin Costner about bringing down Al Capone in The Untouchables. It probably did take the FBI bending Hoover's precious rules to get justice in real life. Frances McDormand plays a truly sad role as the wife of one of the sheriff's deputies who was in on the killing. She's a caring and compassionate woman and indiscreet about her husband's activities. She pays for that. It is restrained, understated, but very powerful performance that netted her a Best Supporting Actress nomination.Mississippi Burning won for Best Cinematography and got a number of other nominations including Best Picture. Sad to say it was up against Rain Man that year and I'd hate to split the difference between what Hackman and what Dustin Hoffman did in his classic.It's ironic that I saw this film and between seeing it and writing about it I attended one of many marriage equality rallies throughout the nation as the Supreme Court hears arguments about same sex marriage. The same people who could not comprehend the mixing of races are in the forefront of a fight against marriage equality because their minds can't comprehend that either. A seismic cultural shift against racial segregation took place just as a seismic cultural shift is occurring now toward the acceptance of the LGBT lives and lifestyles. It's been a privilege to live in these interesting times.Mississippi Burning with a bit of literary license remains a fine dramatic film and should be required viewing for those who want to study those times and get an idea what the civil rights struggle was about. Books will not give you as good an idea as Mississippi Burning will.",

            "review_title": "The Best Film of 1988",
            "content": "Great movies are ones that invoke a strong emotional response that lingers long after the movie is over. Mississippi Burning is that kind of film. You may love it, you  may hate it. You may think that it is an accurate depiction of the south in 1964, you may think its pure fiction. No matter what you will respond strongly.Director Alan Parker has been down this road before with Midnight Express, another crushing, gut-wrenching tale based on a true story. In both cases, a great deal of liberty is taken with the facts, but that doesn't matter. Mississippi Burning is not a docudrama or an A & E special, it is at its heart, a police drama, and a near perfect one at that.It is criticized by some for its depiction of southerners of the time as a group of brain-dead racists with no moral fiber whatsoever. I don't believe that is the movie's intention, but it spends time showing this side of society to make us understand how hate breeds itself, and how it becomes a way of life and an accepted standard. As one character states, \"When we were seven years old, they told us that segregation was in the bible. You hear that long enough, you start to believe it\".Mississippi Burning won a (well-deserved) Oscar for cinematography, but sat and watched Rain Main take home the majors. It was clearly the best film of 1988 and stands as one of the great works of American cinema of the 80's. Hackman and Dafoe are at their best, and Frances McDormand delivers a beautifully understated, powerful performance as the deputy's wife - a woman at war with her sense of right and wrong, struggling with fear and loyalty. Her character is the centerpiece of the movie.This is not a preachy or melodramatic movie. You won't get a lecture on why racism is wrong. You will get an rich, engaging crime drama depicting a pivotal time in American History, and you will never forget it.**** out of ****.",

            "content": "Where?  Where does racism come from?  How can one race feel superior to another?  Are we born with it?  No.  Do we become it on our own?  Maybe?  Or is it perhaps that we are taught it?  There is a small scene in Mississippi Burning that is just as powerful as any Gene Hackman speech or any violent montage to gospel music that is in this film.  There is a rally at a park with the head of the KKK ( without his hood ) telling thousands of people that have gathered that he loves being white.  He loves the fact that Mississippi is segregated.  And in the crowd the camera pans across and shows three year old kids smiling and cheering as gleefully and loudly as their parent's are.  It is haunting.This film is bit like JFK in a way.  It is not an absolute recreation of the events that took place in 1964, but it is a film that tells a true story and then adds a bit of fiction to make it more interesting for a mass audience. For example, the case was not cracked by Mr. Anderson fooling around with Pell's wife.  But that is besides the point, the point being that this film is mesmerizing.  Everything from its direction, cinematography, acting, writing and music, it is the best film of 1988.  And having Rain Man take most of the major awards is really quite sad.  Because Mississippi Burning is much more ambitious, important and well done.  Rain Man is a very good film and I will even go as far as to say that Hoffman is the only one that deserved to win best actor just as much as Hackman did.  But 1988 was a bad year for the rest of the Oscars.  Anyway...I have been edgy before.  Boyz and the Hood did that to me, but this film makes me angry.  It makes me want to jump back into 1964 and try to do something to stop this.  The film is that strong at showing us how terrible and pointless racism is.  And in order to make this film work, there has to be strong elements in all areas.  But for me, what really made me feel the things that I did is the actors that played their roles.Hackman is brilliant.  He gives the performance of a lifetime and it is his anger that gives him his edge.  He sees things differently than Mr. Ward does and that sometimes makes them bump heads with each other.  But they ultimately have the same goal in mind.  Just different ways of achieving that goal.  Dafoe is great as well, but it is the supporting cast that really makes this film.  From Dourif to R. Lee Ermey to Stephen Tobolwolski, these characters are richly portrayed by the actors that play them.  There is however one actor in particular that I wanted to touch on and that is Michael Rooker.  He plays Frank, the nastiest, meanest, no conscience, negro hating person that I think I have ever seen on film.  I don't know where his anger comes from, but he is the kind of character that you can imagine had a violent father that drank too much and always told stories about how bad the black man was.  When Rooker is on screen you listen.  You pay attention to what he is saying and doing.  And my hatred of him was one of my favourite parts of the film.Mississippi Burning shows us how strange people are when it comes to racism. The characters in this film don't know why they hate the way they do, they just know that they do.  And they are powerless to stop themselves.  What happened to the three civil rights workers was a disgrace and a tragedy. But not just because three boys were murdered, but because no one knows why they were murdered,besides racism that is.  Why did they have to die? Because they were a different colour of skin?  Because they were Jewish?  It really doesn't make any sense.Mississippi Burning is one of the best films I have ever seen.  It is important and it is entertaining.  If you haven't seen it, do so just for the scene with Mr. Anderson and Deputy Pell at the barber shop.  That is worth the price of the rental alone.  But for a really important film that has something to say, this is one of the best.",

            "content": "An excellent exploration of the civil rights problems affecting America during the 1960s. The reason MISSISSIPPI BURNING is so profound is that it takes a matter of fact, middle of the road approach, refusing to judge its cast of diverse characters and instead portraying the events as is, without bias. The film presents two actors at the top of their game \u2013 Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe \u2013 playing a couple of FBI agents who visit a small town to investigate some racist murders.Alan Parker fills this film with a slow burning intensity and anger in much the same way he did in ANGEL HEART. The script is literate and affecting, seeking to get into the minds of men we dismiss as racist and learning what makes them tick. The conspiracy angle is by far the most interesting part of the film and I can't imagine anybody not moved come the events of the climax. Of the supporting cast, there's a stand-out turn from a ruthless Michael Rooker, a very good Brad Dourif as the sly deputy, and an excellent Frances McDormand as a would-be love interest. R. Lee Ermey, Pruitt Taylor Vince and Stephen Tobolowsky all put in compelling turns as various sinister characters and the film's story never flags for a second, making this film the final word regarding its subject matter.",

Mississippi is definitely the hottest spot of all as the entire state seems to be split between whites and African Americans. After some white Civil Rights activists disappear, the FBI is called in to investigate (Oscar-nominee Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe). Naturally the sheriff's department is difficult to say the least and it appears that it may have even had a part in the apparent murders. Frances McDormand (Oscar-nominated) proved that she was a truly gifted actress as the wife of one of the local deputies (an evil Brad Dourif). Alan Parker's smart Oscar-nominated direction and the Oscar-winning cinematography give the film a tense feel that leaves its audience visibly shaken during and after its running time. A great achievement. Easily one of the finest films of the 1980s. 5 stars out of 5.",

Based on true events, this is an absorbing drama about one of the most explosive chapters of American history. Hackman is terrific as an agent who doesn't condone the racism, but understands the culture of hatred, having grown up in the South himself. Dafoe is equally good as a young agent who struggles to reconcile his idealistic views about justice with the reality he confronts. McDormand is also fine as the good wife of a redneck sheriff.

            "content": "Inspired by real events this film opens with the murder of three civil rights activists, two white one black, in Mississippi in 1964. When they are reported missing two very different FBI agents are sent to investigate. Rupert Anderson, is a former Mississippi sheriff who doesn't always play by the rules and Alan Ward is a by-the-book high-flier but both are determined to bring those responsible to justice. They won't get much help locally; the police are indifferent at best, complicit at worst and nobody is going to talk because they know what will happen if they are even suspected of talking to the FBI. Soon Ward calls in more personnel and tensions rise even further as local racists try to intimidate the black population. It soon becomes obvious that if the FBI are to get anywhere they will have to break a few rules.Some may have problems by the fact that this is inspired by real murders but then gives a fictionalised investigation... that wasn't a problem for me though. The story presented shines a light on sinister events and attitudes that are far from being ancient history. The overt racism portrayed is disturbing; it isn't just the killers and Klansman who have such attitudes. While the identity of the killers isn't in doubt just how they will be brought to justice is. Gene Hackman gives a great performance as Agent Rupert Anderson; Willem Dafoe is solid as Agent Alan Ward and Frances McDormand impresses as Mrs Pell, wife of a deputy involved in the case. The rest of the cast impress too; they make some very unpleasant characters believable. Overall I'd definitely say this is worth watching; it has an important message but also proves to be a gripping thriller.",

            "content": "Well, I guess this is why movies are so personal to the viewer.I've read some of the other comments here and have seen words like \"condescending\" and \"mediocre.\"I couldn't disagree more. \"Mississippi Burning\" is an intellectually challenging movie. It demands that you immerse yourself in the worst of southern culture, whether you like it or not.Based on a true story, the film takes place in 1964 (my birth year, incidentally) in a small town ugly and virulent with racism. The good ol' boy sheriff and his stoolies ambush and in cold blood murder three civil rights workers. The world's a-changing, but the power-brokers in this place refuse to let that happen. They'll do anything to prevent blacks from taking their rightful place at the table - literally.The FBI sends a couple of mismatched agents in to search for the three missing young men. One agent (Hackman) is 'old school', sly, and knows his enemies a little too well. The other (Dafoe) is a naive Kennedy fire-eater, ready to bring the full force of the FBI and military down upon this small town's head. Although he is easy to underestimate at first, he grows into his role, showing astonishing decisiveness and strength.The relationship between the town's blacks and whites is complicated and fraught with rules - spoken and unspoken. It's a not-so-secret secret that the civil rights workers have been murdered. Hackman and Dafoe just have to get the bodies and the evidence, that's all. Fear and loathing prevent that from happening, until the wife of a deputy (the amazing Frances McDormand) throws herself on the fire and blows her slimy husband's alibi.There is justice - of a sort - in the end. It's not enough. Real change crawls on it's belly in the south.\"Mississippi Burning\" is a movie of operatic gestures. The script is spongey with regional color and snappy, powerful dialogue.Hackman and McDormand are simply magical. They don't take or make a false step from the first frame to the last. As she would go on to prove in later films, McDormand doesn't just 'play' a character - she IS that character. And Hackman is never more affecting that in this film. One syllable from him is more subtle than an entire Shakespeare speech when delivered by a lesser actor. Hackman is a national treasure.IMO, Dafoe is a well-meaning revelation until circumstances forces him to cave into Hackman's just-get-it-done ways. He comes to see that idealism must relent to pragmatism in extreme cases, although that knowledge repulses him. He wants nothing more than to get out of the south and go home to a world he believes is cleaner and more simple.The conclusion of \"Mississippi\" is more bitter than sweet. The guilty are arrested and convicted, although their various punishments are a joke. (R. Lee Ermey is the only one in the bunch who meets a just fate.) McDormand is brutally beaten to within an inch of her life for betraying the status quo and doing the right thing. Although she and Hackman have fallen in love, she refuses to leave with him because \"this\" - gesturing to the vandalized ruins of the house she was born in - \"is my home.\"I know the history, and I know this movie inside and out. And yet I still bawl like a baby every time I see it. The power of this film and the fact that \"Mississippi\" is based on ACTUAL EVENTS never fails to get to me.\"Mississippi Burning\" has a place in my 'Top 50 Dramas.'",

This is a very mature investigation of a racist Mississippi town where the brutal murder of three civil rights activists took place in 1964. The film is inspired by real-life events.Dafoe and Hackman play the two FBI agents sent to investigate. Their differing styles of pursuing the case and Dafoe's belated admiration for Hackman's \"method's\" is an interesting layer of flesh added to the structure of the film.You will see some really nasty racist characters played by familiar faces like Brad Dourif, Lee Ermey and an especially violent Michael Rooker. All are excellent. Frances McDormand really steals the movie as the wife of racist Dourif.This film is far more intelligent than some of the Stanley Kramer movies of the 60's which dealt with racism. It does not shy away from showing the seriousness (and sickness) of the racial mindset without being excessively preachy. It is in fact very watchable - largely due to a colorful and humorous Hackman whose character was himself a Mississippi small-town Sheriff at one time and understands the pitfalls of the Hoover boys going in all guns blazing.Highly recommended!",

In comparison to other states, Mississippi was (and largely is) behind the times in many ways, and many crimes were launched or not disclosed due to overall mentality and indifference -- thus, community solidarity can have both good and bad elements. The movie shows how difficult is to investigate if people are at bay, and when certain activities are not perceived as felonies. The events are logical and catchy to follow, largely thanks to character actors like Gene Hackman, Willem Dafoe, Frances McDormand, and Brad Dourif who make a difference even while being briefly on screen -- no cute faces or politically correct solutions, but harsh and effective methods for solving a severe crime.It is neither family movie not entertainment, but depiction of black spot in the US history after WWII. But laid out and performed well, without digital effects or long reasoning on human values.",

            "content": "When three young civil rights workers (two white and one black) going missing in the deep south of America, the FBI send two agents in to investigate.  Liberal young agent Ward and cynical local agent Anderson both approach the case in different ways, however both come up against a wall of silence and racism which seems to go all the way through the community, making their task near impossible.What do I mean when I say this is a bit too much of a film?  Well, the issues, history and settings here are all semi-factual and therefore should be quite an interesting film that attacks the heart.  Instead however, it is a thriller type film \u0096 and this becomes more and more evident as it goes on. The final 30 minutes set aside themes and discussion and go right for a thriller climax with enjoyable touches.  However it does lose sight of the issues, although, in fairness, it didn't have too good a grasp on them in the first place.The film never really sets out to do much more than paint the community as racist \u0096 and it does it rather too easily.  All the white racists are painted as inbred and monstrous (I'm not complaining!) while the black characters are all pretty much a silent group of extras.  I understand why the film did it this way, as to allow development of characters on both sides would have caused the thriller side of it to become baggier and less effective.  As it is, the broad strokes still work because I don't think many of us need to really be convinced that such racism is tolerable: it's easier just to cut out the debate in a thriller.The plot is pretty good and does paint the black situation pretty well.  It works best as a thriller though and early attempts to show the divide and so on are slowly moved to the back burner in favour of thriller touches.  Aside from a total lack of black characters and a tendency just to pigeon hole the white characters, the cast do a reasonable job, with plenty of well known faces.  Dafoe is good in the lead, despite being a little too wide-eyed for a FBI agent in charge of a major case.  Also, watching it now, it's funny at times because he sounds very like Agent Smith when he says `Mr Anderson'. Hackman overplays to good effect and he steals almost every scene he is in, although his romancing of McDormand is a little drawn out.  The support cast includes some reasonable turns from well-known faces including Dourif, Ermey and Tobolowsky.Overall this film has a reputation for being a quite powerful issue film. However it reality it is more a thriller which uses this setting of racial hatred as it's background and driver, rather than looking into it as a debate.  In fairness, it doesn't suffer for this and is actually an enjoyable film, which also serves as a reminder of a very common situation only a few short years ago.",

I will say, some scenes because the violence was very intense to the maximum, were rather upsetting to watch, like any scene when someone was attacked, the nature of the violence was very upsetting. The gunshot at the beginning was unbelievably loud, and made me jump quite violently. However, it is a very powerful and tense film, helped by a well-written script and an atmospheric music score. The dark brooding cinematography helped considerably to the film's proceedings, and the performances were excellent, with Gene Hackman mesmerising in the lead, and Willem Dafoe perfectly matching him. The story is a powerful one, and rarely slips in tension. Overall, a very tense and powerful film, long and quite violent, but a very good film, all the same. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "I never understood why this movie was never on the Top 250. If American History X can make the Top 250 why not Mississippi Burning? Even Crash made the top 250 and this movie is way more powerful than Crash will ever be. Incredible. Mississippi Burning is a very hard film to look at but a very truthful and gritty look at racism in southern Mississippi during the Civil Rights era. The story details FBI agents Rupert Anderson(Gene Hackman)and Alan Ward(Willem Dafoe) search for the killers an African-American male and two Jewish males. Their search takes them to the heart of Mississippi where the racism is deep-seated and the police are inflexible to a fault. They later realize how deep the police involvement in the killings were. No other movie about race relations has moved me like Mississippi Burning has. American History X is phenomenal but it didn't make me as angry as this movie did. I wish I had the power to stop these psychos from doing what they did. Mississippi Burning was the movie that made me question my faith in organized religion. I couldn't fathom that I was believing in the same belief system that these racist lunatics were believing in. I dumped belief in organized religions after extensive research at the age of 20 but this movie sparked my curiosity. Gene Hackman is wonderful as Agent Rupert. He steals every scene he is in. Willem Dafoe is great as his partner Alan Ward. Agent Anderson(Hackman) handles things in an unconventional manner while Agent Ward(Dafoe) is by the book. This is where Dafoe showed his true potential before he started screwing up his career by appearing in raw sewage like Speed 2, Boondock Saints, Body Of Evidence and XXX: State Of The Union. Also great in this movie is Brad Dourif as the racist Deputy Clinton Pell and R. Lee Ermey as the racist mayor. I also like how they showed the views of the average ignorant Mississippian and how the cops either participated in the killing and terrorizing of Blacks in Mississippi or sat back and watched it happen. Conclusion: Mississippi Burning is the best movie of 1989 hands down and is definitely required viewing. But be forewarned that this is not an easy movie to watch. But if you can stomach the racial violence and slurs you have a gem on your hands. I find it sad that the director Alan Parker didn't have many movies after this one.",

It's the story of how a group of Ku Klux Klan members murdered civil rights activists James Chaney, Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman in Philadelphia, Mississippi, in the summer of 1964. The movie portrays the murders, but FBI agents Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) and Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) are made up. It turns out that the FBI bribed one of the murderers to rat on the other two, and all the while the FBI was tapping Schwerner's father's phone to see if he was a Communist.So, they played with the facts. Hollywood often does that. Either way, \"Mississippi Burning\" still is a good movie, reminding us of a time in our country's history when we were about to explode.",

As you can tell this has changed with this incarnation, inlcuding another \"Summary line\" that sums things up (I know \"duh\").Having said all that, the movie touches on a very sensitive subject matter and I reckon February being Black History month is as good as any other month to watch this and realize certain issues America had and is still facing for a multiple of reasons. It also shows that even when you know a culprit, someone who is likely to do something again if he gets the chance, no matter how wrong it is what he did and is still likely to do .. there has to be checks and balances. And while you may think (rightfully?) that I'm talking abot current events, I do (also) mean the happenings in this movie.The pairing of Gene Hackman (more in tune of what is going because he lived certain things, flawed in his approaches as much as his partner here though) and Willem Dafoe is an amazing one. They both fight for what is right ... but as you may know, being right does not always result in you ... being right ... I don't think I have to explain that and sorry for the pun.I thin a few things are predictable here to say the least, but with great actors, like the ones already mentioned and Frances McDormand who might have her very first appearance on Film here (I didn't check, but someone suggested exactly that) to name one more ... a tough but essential viewing not just for those who are into Dramas ... might make a great double bill with In the Heat of the Night, which I also have to rewatch asap",

The missing workers got a lot of publicity, extending over months, not just days, thereby focusing national attention on the segregationist South. Had the bodies been discovered sooner, I expect the impact would have been less. How ironic for the KKK.Hackman's sly ex-sheriff turned FBI man dominates the film. Charming one minute, resolute the next, he's a good foil for DaFoe's by-the-book chief investigator. I'm in no position to evaluate the movie's details, but the dramatic values more than compensate for a lengthy run-time. I'm so glad the producers used a plain Frances McDormand in the feminine lead rather than some glamor-puss. Plus, she really delivers in a poignant role. Filming on location also provides real color and authenticity to impoverished conditions. Can't help noticing, in passing, that Blacks don't smile when they see adversity strike the KKK. After decades of oppression, that seems odd. I wonder if that was an authentic response or the movie makers' idea.My only reservation is with the brief interviews. How did the interviewees decide what to say since all appear to young to have been mature in 1964. Oh well, that's a minor point in what amounts to a splendidly produced historical drama that should not be passed up.",

            "content": "In 1966, Martin Luther King visited Philadelphia, Mississippi, seat of Neshoba County and the town where three young civil rights workers disappeared two years before. Leading a procession of 300 people, he was confronted by a mob of angry white men brandishing hoes, broomsticks, and ax handles. One even turned a hose on King's group, which fought their way to the courthouse.There King confronted the deputy sheriff, Ray Price, who he knew had arrested the civil rights workers on the night they disappeared. He turned and told the crowd that there were people among them who had participated in the murder. \"You're damn right,\" Price muttered. \"They're right behind you.\"King was moved to write later: \"This is a terrible town. The worst I've seen. There is a complete reign of terror here.\"\"Mississippi Burning\" aims to give a taste for how bad it was, and just how superhuman the efforts to stop it had to be in order to succeed. It's flawed because it's not terribly functional as a crime drama or nuanced enough as a civil rights story, but its heart is in the right place, its grasp of the situation solid, and its detractors mostly attack it for all the wrong reasons.Like why does \"Mississippi Burning\" give all the credit to breaking the murder case to the FBI? Didn't director Alan Parker and writer Chris Gerolmo know FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was a racist? Yes, and he hated vigilante groups with a passion, particularly the Ku Klux Klan. Plus he was acting under orders of President Johnson, who was very disturbed about the disappearances, enough to place a phone call to a Mississippi senator asking for help finding the kids (and being told by the senator it was all probably just a hoax). WhiteHouseTapes.org has the phone calls on record, while Doug Linder's Famous Trials website has the full story. The FBI did send hundreds of agents to Neshoba County, they rankled the local authorities big time, they found the murdered workers, and they arrested several people for the crime, including the sheriff and the deputy sheriff, getting relatively light convictions for most, but convictions all the same, a first involving the murder of a black by whites.Did the black population of Neshoba County contribute much to solving the case? I don't know, but King's experience there is telling. There simply was no regard for the rights of non-whites. Blacks were completely powerless there, dealing with a white power structure that was nakedly aggressive about keeping them down. In many Southern jurisdictions, white authorities looked the other way when the Klan did their work. As the FBI investigation in Neshoba County revealed, the sheriff's office and the Klan worked hand in glove.\"Mississippi Burning\" has great acting, sumptuous period detail, an unflinching desire to show the terrible toll of racism on a society, not only with lynchings but most powerfully, in the story Gene Hackman tells about how his father dealt with a black neighbor's mule. Just the way he uses his eyes as he tells the story, without the slightest attempt at drama, draws you into the terrible dehumanization that racism brings not to its targets but those who buy into it.The truth of the story was more shaded than Parker presents here. He's not a racist, or an FBI apologist. He's a filmmaker who wants to entertain his audience. He unrealistically overamps the Klan violence, to the point where they seem to be burning some black person's building once a week even though the FBI is making little progress through most of the movie. There's an early scene where Willem Dafoe's character (based not on an FBI agent but a Justice Department official named John Michael Doar) sits down next to a black man and starts asking him questions about the murder, in full view of a hundred or so people. No criminal investigator works like that, especially in the FBI.The story of the Mississippi Burning case is so compelling, why fictionalize it at all? The liberties they take, with the exception of the deputy sheriff and his wife, don't really help the plot out much. There's an attempt to make Hackman and Dafoe into fractious partners, but the scenes are ridiculous, especially when Dafoe pulls a gun on his partner after teasing him about his relationship with the deputy's wife.Frankly, the most interesting place this case was fought was in the courtroom, but we see little of that, or of Judge Cox, the bigoted federal justice who passed down the final sentences after heavy prodding from Washington.The movie does go for fireworks more often than it should. Hackman's two big confrontation scenes with the bad guys, at the speakeasy and in the barber shop, serve no apparent criminal investigation purpose and are meant to just make the audience feel good. He doesn't even get a word out of the deputy (played excellently by Brad Dourif) in between punches. But damn it works like hell.After the case was successfully prosecuted, Martin Luther King was moved to say the following: \"I must commend the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the work they have done in uncovering the perpetrators of this dastardly act. It renews my faith in democracy.\"Manipulated or not, I feel the same way after watching \"Mississippi Burning.\"",

The three kids disappeared. No one, black or white, is willing to cooperate with the \"Hoover boys\" that poke around in the small town's business. The blacks won't cooperate because they're afraid, the whites for more obvious reasons. And some less obvious ones. As the clued-in Hackman puts it, \"They have to live here long after we're packed up and gone.\" Just about every character is a stereotype that's played out like a card in a hand of bridge. The head of the local Ku Klux Klan, who calls himself \"a local businessman\" is a balding nincompoop who hates not just blacks but Papists and Jews and probably Brobdignagians. He doesn't have a family. Not even a dog or a cat as far as we can tell. The other heavies, including the prototypical redneck Michael Rooker with his frozen sneer, don't have families either, except for Deputy Brad Dourif, who has a wife. But he only has a wife so that the movie can show us that not all Southern whites are murdering racists. Some are sweet and lovable and attractive, in the way that Carol Burnett is attractive, and, as just about sublimely played by Frances McDormand, are so haunted by distaste for these illegal caste-ridden shenanigans that she's able and willing to squeal to Gene Hackman's FBI agent about the murders. That indiscretion gets her clobbered.The performances are all good and some are splendid. Hackman could not be better. Every move he makes, every line of dialog, carries weight. DaFoe's character is less colorfully delineated. McDormand is outstanding, and so are Rooker, Dourif, and the guy who plays the KKK head. (What a trio of villains.) The tobacco-chewing Sheriff is great in a small supporting role.When the FBI is stretched to its official limits without results, Hackman is given license to use his own methods. Enter two unofficial FBI heavies. One is a balding red-head with bulging eyes who has since made a career out of playing serial murderers. The other is a huge black guy with an ominous and resonant baritone who threatens to castrate the Mayor unless he spills the beans, which the Mayor does, leading to almost all the desired convictions.The direction is tasteful. When the decomposing corpses are uncovered, it's in long shot. When Dourif beats hell out of McDormand, we only get a few introductory blows before the cut, just so we know what's going to happen next.Location shooting is evocative. It's a convincing small Southern town shimmering in the summer heat. Most \"Southern\" scene -- the silent guy on the Choctaw reservations who is carving up catfish. The characters, although they may as well carry sandwich boards advertising their function in the script, are pretty well drawn.If there's a problem with the film it's that it is laid out like a dramatic movie in the usual form of rising climaxes. The payoffs towards the end simply don't fit in with the otherwise realistic depiction of events. I did not for a moment believe that undercover FBI agents were brought in to kidnap the Mayor and threaten to cut off his family jewels. That belongs to a movie script, or to some black hole of a CIA prison in Bulgaria, not to a narrative that purports to be based on an historic event.The final impression the film leaves you with is how surprisingly easy it is for a deeply felt and thoroughly entrenched set of values to change so quickly. A generation has passed, only a generation, since the governor of Mississippi's neighboring state stood in the doorway of the university and proclaimed, \"Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.\" The situation displayed here, in 1964, isn't perfect now. Nothing is perfect. But it's a hell of a lot better than it was then. This is actually a curiously mixed blessing. It leaves Southern white people with still another defeat that they must get over. And it leaves blacks with a great deal of anti-white resentment that has no place to go.",

What stops the film being the masterpiece of importance it should have been, is that director Alan Parker gives way to over fictionalising the already harsh facts of the case. In the process, choosing to stereotype both parties and sidestepping equality issues in favour of an FBI uneasy alliance, and a god forsaken romantic sub-plot! It's such a shame that Parker and his backers obviously lost sight of the reason they picked the project to film in the first place.So what are we left with? Well it's still one hell of a film for sure. The harshness and emotional impact is evident as the story unfolds, the troubled South vividly brought to life in a sea of burning crosses and segregated restaurants, with Peter Biziou's Academy Award winning cinematography an essential extra character in the piece. The cast is almost to die for, Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe take the lead roles as our feuding, at odds, FBI investigators, Popeye Doyle meets Sgt Elias anyone? But its with the supporting cast that Mississippi Burning becomes an essential watch for fans of actors. Rolling off the tongue like a who's who of weasel character actors is Michael Rooker, Brad Douriff, R. Lee Ermey, Stephen Tobolowsky, and Pruitt Taylor Vince, with FBI support coming from Tobin Bell and Kevin Dunn. Frances McDormand does fine with a caricature written part, whilst fans of Biloxi Blues {me} will delight in seeing the wonderfully named Park Overall laying on her hussy act in the beauty salon.At times shattering, at others frustrating, Mississippi Burning sadly only scratches the surface of the topic to hand, but for sure the movie world is all the more better for films like this, so in that it becomes an essential watch, so see it if you haven't already. 8/10",

Chafing under Ward's micromanagement in insisting upon a futile by - the - book approach, Anderson through seductive down - home charm, develops an informant in Mrs Pell (Frances McDormand), the battered wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell (Brad Dourif).Discovery of the bodies leads to a turning point in which Ward, acknowledging that the book has no answer, accedes to Anderson's irregular tactics: kidnapping glib and unbelievably cute Mayor Tilman and forcing him to describe the killings and reveal the culprits, assaulting Deputy Pell in reprisal for beating Mrs Pell, luring the cluprits to a bogus meeting and rescuing Lester Cowen from a faked attempt by the co-conspirators to hang him. Under the erroneous belief that his fellow bad guys intend to kill him, Lester spills the beans.Charged with civil rights violations, many conspirators including Deputy Pell are found guilty. Sheriff Stuckey is acquitted. Mayor Tilman commits suicide.\nGene Hackman plays the two - fisted Rebel Sherriff Anderson turned FBI agent with great aplomb. Sweet as sugar and mean as dog dung, Anderson can molt from as gentle as a new - born calf to as aggressive as a charging bull.\nHackman's Pennsylvania accent does not creep into his Southron expressions or speech as it did in his depiction of a New York City Detective in the movie version of French Connection.William Defoe plays the stamp pressed FBI agent, with the pressed dark suit and homburg in the sweltering heat of the deep South. True to his character, he'll get nowhere in the cozy world of the deep south.Great film.",

            "content": "Even though \"Mississippi Burning\" is far from a failure, the movie still give me the feeling as if it could had been much better and far more effective with its subject, had it picked a bit of a different approach at times.\"Mississippi Burning\" is a pure film-makers movie, that relies heavily on the skills of its cast & crew. Due to this however the movie looses its focus at times, when its story starts to more rely on some biased stereotypes and clich\u00e9s, which makes the story at times rather unlikely, instead of powerful and effective. Perhaps the story should had put more its emphasis on its two main characters, played by Willem Dafoe and Gene Hackman and their relationship as FBI-partners, who both have different ideas and styles of approaches.The whole racial theme serves as the basis for the movie its story. It's however not really a story that grabs me and draws me into it, even though the subject itself is to me always interesting and potentially gripping and extremely powerful. \"A Time to Kill\" is for instance a movie who tackled this subject much better, in my opinion.It's not like the cast & crew didn't gave their very best though. Alan Paker provided the movie with his experienced directing abilities, though its a bit uneven at times with its themes and approaches, like often is the case with most of his movies. He doesn't always seem to be able to put its emphasis on one main thing.The movie knows to capture the right atmosphere for a movie with such a theme like this one has. It means that the movie has some effective cinematography and picked some good settings.The movie has a bit of a surprising cast, with for instance Willem Dafoe in a quite big role opposite Gene Hackman. Perhaps Dafoe gives away one of his best performances in this movie and he allowed himself to go through a metamorphose, physically and acting-wise. Giving Gene Hackman a cop-role is always a good idea. It always sort of reminds you of his \"The French Connection\" performance. The movie also stars a well cast R. Lee Ermey, who had just won an Oscar for his \"Full Metal Jacket\" role and Michael Rooker. It also stars some good actors, who were still quite unknown at the time of this movie, such as Frances McDormand, Brad Dourif, Pruitt Taylor Vince and Tobin Bell.It's a good and well made movie that could had been a more powerful one if it had put its emphasis at different things at times. The movie now sometimes looses its focus, not making this the movie that it potentially could had become.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "review_title": "Outstanding film and a great effort in dealing with difficult themes.",
            "content": "First of all, let me say that \"Mississippi Burning\" is one of my favorite films of all time, I've seen it several times, on several different occasions and periods of time, and it's a movie that always manages to change my view on things. It's funny, it's the same movie but looks like there's something new to be discovered there every time I see it. But what attracted me to write something about it now is the fact of watching it for the first time after seeing the award winning film \"The Help\", whose themes are a little similar but the approach given is completely different. Comes as a sad fact that people are running away to see \"The Help\" (which is good considering how long Hollywood hasn't dealt with a heavy subject that racism is), taking it too seriously believing it's all truth but they probably never watched Alan Parker's classic.Based on a real case that happened in 1964 \"Mississippi Burning\" starts with the brutal murder of three young Human Rights activists who were helping the black communities of Mississippi. Later on, the FBI comes to town led by the young and idealist Agent Ward (Willem Dafoe) followed by the veteran Agent Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) to search for the boys in what most people thought to be a simple case of missing person. So, it was the 1960's, lines were divided and racism, lynchings were a common thing back there in the South and here's two agents and part of the Hoover boys trying to change things down there, having a lot of trouble in getting answers about what happened with those activists. While Ward wants to do the investigation by the book, following right procedures and all, the more experienced Anderson is quite the opposite, preferring to beat up suspects or use more unethical methods but always getting what he needs. He's a man that lived in a similar place and knows how things work so he understands he can't smile and be nice to people in order to get what he wants. Different men, clashing at each other from time to time but working on the same goal. In \"Mississppi Burning\" we feel outraged, angry, sad with all the hatred whites had for blacks in those days. Prejudice and its roots are difficult to understand, it's something we can't accept and we can't tolerate but the movie manages to give an inexcusable but quite real argument on why it happens. A key moment from the film is when Hackman's character tells to Dafoe a story that happened when he was a child, when his father killed the mule of a black man he knew, after getting sick of hearing his friends teasing him saying that the black guy was more important than he because he had a mule. Hackman concludes with this: \"My old man was just so full of hate that he didn't know that being poor was what was killing him.\" Therefore, what we get here is that racism, in most cases, comes from a paranoia that one race must be better than the other, otherwise it'll take advantage of everything that exists. Absurd. Returning to \"The Help\" issue, (and I do like that film), I don't agree with that distorted, colorful and very humored presentation of how African Americans were treated in the South, the excess of comic reliefs were too much. The ones featured in \"MB\" are quite good and always followed by some tension in the middle e.g. when Rupert quotes to the Mayor Tillman about why he loves baseball as being the only thing where a black man can wave a stick without causing a riot. Sure, we're not getting a truthful full account of what really happened in 1964, there's plenty of fictionalized moments in Parker's film but it's easier to believe in this film than seeing all the humored moments of Tate Taylor's film. On its own, this is a really must-see film even though it's not much of a comfortable watching, it's a true challenge to many of us. Even today I get disturbed with some of the painful moments of it. It's haunting (in a good way). At the same time, there's more cheerful moments that are a great pleasure to see over and over (Deputy Pell getting his beard made by Anderson, best scene ever!). It's an impressive work in its technical aspects, the Oscar winning cinematography of Peter Biziou (an arguable work for many viewers since it's too dark but it reflects the serious subject); editing and sound, the music by Trevor Jones, the words by Chris Gerolmo who made a terrific script. The casting couldn't be better with Hackman in one of his greatest roles, Dafoe, Frances McDormand and the big team of villains played by Brad Dourif, Stephen Tobolowsky, Michael Rooker, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Gailard Sartain and R. Lee Ermey, all spectacular performances.Alan Parker's most impactant film of the 1980's and certainly one of the greatest films of all time, \"Mississippi Burning\" might not be 100% real and not being all so truth to the facts but still works to present a dark period of American history. It's a gripping film that should be used in schools and in colleges. A nice suggestion to watch along with \"MB\" is the TV film \"Murder on Mississippi\" (starring Tom Hulce and Blair Underwood) that recreates the trajectory of the murdered activists. 10/10",

I'm really not sure how to rate this film because on one hand it's an incredibly entertaining police drama that gets your blood boiling at the opening shot and it just gets hotter and hotter as the film moves along. I was having a great time watching this film and then something entered my mind that made me rather nervous. Should I be enjoying a film with this subject matter? I'm really not sure if the film is proper entertainment because even though it's based on a true story the director made no secret that events were changed up for entertainment value. The images in this film are rather harrowing and at times incredibly hard to watch but the viewer, or at least I wanted to see the racist killed. In that sense this entertainment is more like a Death Wish film when I'm not sure if should be. The images of blacks being beaten, raped and hung got me angry and my blood boiling but was it because of great film-making or because seeing these images would make any human angry? I'm really not sure how great the storytelling was but again, on one hand, it kept me entertained all the way through.What does work are the performances by the rather amazing cast. Dafoe has always been an underrated actor and his calm approach in the film is perfectly done and Frances McDormand comes off very good as well. Brad Dourif, R. Lee Ermey, Gailard Sartain, Michael Rooker and Pruitt Taylor Vince play just some of the racist and all of them are bone chilling in their performances. The group of men, on an entertainment level, make for some great movie villains. The real standout here is Hackman who delivers another brilliant performance and really has the toughest job in the film. At one point of the film he's laughing about the racist subject matter and even telling joke but in a blink of an eye Hackman changes his character to show the anger than any human would. The way Hackman juggles his character through so many emotions is a real treat to watch and in my opinion this is one of the best performances from the actor.Once again, I'm torn on the entertainment value a film like this should deliver but after thinking about it for a while I guess this is a perfect film. From what I've read, a lot of controversy surrounded this film as many people felt too many facts were changed to make the FBI look good or whatever. As I write this I'm just going to say that it might be entertainment but it doesn't coward away from showing the horrors of the South at the time.",

            "review_title": "A Southern Dirty Harry",
            "content": "There have been a number of films, such as \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", \"Ghosts of Mississippi\" and \"A Time to Kill\" which have used the conventions of the courtroom thriller to examine the problem of racism in American society, particularly in the Deep South. \"Mississippi Burning\" uses the conventions of another type of crime drama, the \"buddy cop\" movie, in order to examine the same problem. The \"buddy cop\" film was one that was growing in popularity in the eighties; \"Lethal Weapon\", sometimes regarded as the most influential film in the genre, had come out the previous year.The film is set in Mississippi in 1964 and is loosely based on the real-life FBI investigation into the murders of three civil rights workers in that year. It focuses on two fictional FBI agents sent to investigate the murders. As is common with \"buddy\" movies (think of the roles played by Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in \"Lethal Weapon\") the two men are very different in character and do not start out as \"buddies\" at all- indeed, they start out by disliking one another. Agent Alan Ward, played by Willem Dafoe, is the younger of the two, although he is ostensibly senior in rank. He is a politically liberal, idealistic northerner who sympathises with the ideals of the Civil Rights Movement. He takes a straightforward, \"by the book\" attitude to law enforcement.Agent Rupert Anderson, portrayed by Gene Hackman, is considerably older than Ward and a native Mississippian whose career in law enforcement began as Sheriff of a small town similar to the one in which the murders took place. Although he disagrees with the racist attitudes which prevail in the area, he has a deeper understanding than Ward of race relations in the south and of the motivations of white southerners. He is haunted by memories of the part played by his father, a poor white farmer and bigoted racist, in the persecution of a black neighbour. Whereas Ward is a \"by the book\" liberal, Anderson can be seen as a Southern version of Dirty Harry, or perhaps of Hackman's own \"tough cop\" character, Popeye Doyle. He realises that standard investigation methods are unlikely to produce results, largely because potential witnesses are too terrified to give evidence or even to collaborate with the Bureau. (The killers were all members of the Ku Klux Klan, and the Klan are determined to thwart the investigation through intimidation). Anderson decides to fight fire with fire, resorting to methods that even Harry Callahan might have blanched at, such as threatening to have one suspect castrated. Ward, realising that his own methods have not succeeded, is persuaded to give his blessing to Anderson's approach.Hackman received a well-deserved \"Best Actor\" nomination, as this is one of his best performances. His Anderson is one of the cinema's most memorable \"tough cops\" alongside Clint Eastwood's Callahan and Steve McQueen's Bullitt; deceptively easy-going with a cynical streak of humour, but capable of an icy ruthlessness when needed. Dafoe, rather surprisingly, missed out on an Oscar nomination, but there was one for Frances McDormand as the wife of one of the suspects who agrees to inform on her husband when she begins to suspect that he was involved in the crime. The film itself was nominated for \"Best Picture\", but lost out to that other fine movie \"Rain Man\".As a crime thriller \"Mississippi Burning\" is a very good one; director Alan Parker handles the action well and there is a constant sense of tension, of events moving rapidly and inexorably towards a shattering climax. The film was controversial when it came out in 1988, largely because it was seen as advocating uncompromising and illegal methods of law enforcement. It was also criticised for allegedly portraying black characters as passive victims of violence and for glorifying the FBI's role in the Civil Rights struggle; in reality J. Edgar Hoover had little sympathy with the cause and only got involved reluctantly under pressure from President Johnson.There may be justice in some of these criticisms, but I nevertheless found it a film well worth watching. It was advertised under the slogan \"1964- when America was at war with itself\". This may seem over-dramatic, but there is a sense in which it is true. Civil Rights leaders such as Martin Luther King may have intended their movement to be non-violent, but their opponents had no intention of playing by the same rules. \"Mississippi Burning\" is a film that asks similar questions about the philosophy of law enforcement to those raised by \"Dirty Harry\" . We may be uncomfortable with the methods of a Rupert Anderson- but part of our discomfort is the realisation that the such methods may have been necessary to break the power which the Klan held over much of the South. 8/10",

            "content": "Mississippi Burning takes place during a harrowing time for the United States and more specifically, the black people. In 1964, America was in the midst of the civil rights movement and in the South, racism was prevalent and tensions between both the whites and blacks were through the roof. This film does an excellent job on telling a story that depicts this and as a result, we get a film that's moving, touching, and even courageous.Alan Parker's film is about how two radically different FBI agents team together to solve the case of the three missing civil rights workers whom the authorities believe the Ku Klux Klan have a part in the disappearance.The acting is excellent thanks to the lead performances by Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe. Hackman, good as always, delivers an excellent \"deceptively calm\" performance. On the other hand, Dafoe plays by the book and does a great job. Frances McDormand delivers a powerhouse as well as she is the clue to exactly what happened to these three men.Overall, Mississippi Burning is an excellent, but very moving film as it tells a harrowing story. The white Southerners are depicted as evil in the film, but in reality they may have well been evil. They refused the blacks their natural rights and as a result, these sort of things happened. This is a great thriller and it's one that should keep you on your toes. I rate this film 9/10.",

            "content": "\"1964.  When America was at war with itself.\"What a tagline.  It signifies perfectly what was going on in the south during the 1960's.  The story to Mississippi Burning is simple.  Three civil rights workers are killed.  An investigation is launched to find the culprits.  Two FBI agents(Gene Hackman in an Oscar-nominated role and Willem Dafoe) are put on the case.  They encounter the hatred and violence that was associated with the investigation which included the usual burning crosses, lynchings, and Klan rallies.  I enjoyed this movie very much and just so you know, an African-American is writing this review.  I'm not going to go get all preachy now, but I will say this, racism SUCKS!  In my opinion, some people just can't grasp the concept that people will always be different and that's why some people feel more superior over another race.  It's just sickening to know that this stuff still goes on in America today, in 2001.  The acting here is great.  Gene Hackman is great as usual, and so is Willem Dafoe.  Frances McDormand is good too in an Oscar-nominated supporting role. I think two of the most over-looked performances ,however, come from Brad Dourif as Deputy Pell(who by the way is secretly a Klansman) and Michael Rooker who plays Frank Bailey, another Klansman.  Rooker's Bailey is definitely the nastiest, racist person ever brought to screen.  The scene where a group of Klansmen burn down a Black church is just terrifying.  When I saw him kick that young boy in the face, I saw just how hateful Bailey really is.  I felt like screaming to that boy to fight back even if it did mean certain death for him. Like the author of the review \"Where Does Hatred Come From?\", I think that the rally scene in the park was a very haunting scene especially with the little 3-year old kids smiling and cheering along with there parents. \nLastly, I would just like to say that this movie reminds me a lot of Norman Jewison's film \"In The Heat Of The Night\" because both films have similar issues regarding racism in America.Mississippi Burning is a great film that shouldn't be missed.10/10",

Gene Hackman leads the stellar performances-he's phenomenal-with Willem Dafoe and a young Frances McDormand supporting him beautifully.\nI don't think the plot is exactly what moves this story along, but rather the overall theme. In fact, the brutal, ignorant racism that underlies the motives of the Mississippi men in the movie is a kind of given for the 1960s (and unfortunately, in some quarters, to this day). The FBI swooping down on this town is not quite the admirable sight it should be, and that's to the credit of the moviemakers. Large institutional law enforcement was necessary to break the local politics (and morality) there, but it comes off as heavy handed and insensitive.\nAnd that's where Hackman thrives, being the loner amidst the crowd, doing the dirty work necessary and that ends up being heroic in the end.\nThe filming (and all the fires suggested by the title) make for a vigorous movie to watch. It's a good, classic telling of a well known tale. And I hint at what makes the movie a little limited-it is telling a story we all kind of know, that there were a lot of truly hateful white people inflicting harm and violence onf black people in the deep South. I wish it had found a way to make it more distinctive. Maybe for those who don't really know all this happened, it's a big bang way to find out, but if you already have the gist of it in your head, this will travel some familiar ground.\nIt tells its story so well, however, it's still a great watch.

However, on subsequent viewings, the ultra-Liberal bias of the people making this movie became more and more evident. Typical of Liberal elitists, they make every Southerner in this film (but one) look like very stupid, extremely racist hicks - the kind of people who want to strangle yourself.Hey, no one argues that racism is bad, bad thing but this goes to ridiculous extremes while giving cheap shots to Christians, as well. That's another typical feature of liberal bias. They have no problem showing us those slimeballs who are anti-Semitic, as also portrayed here, but at the same time the people who make the films can't hide their own anti-Christian bias.Too bad because Hackman and Dafoe are superb and the story moves very well. It's a fast two hours of film \"entertainment.\" Note: beware the language is very rough with way too many usages of the Lord's name in vain.",

            "content": "THE FILM: The third of Parker's 80's heyday films following Birdy and Angel Heart,Mississippi Burning is an acting masterclass.From Hackman and Defoe in the leads to all the supporting cast. As per usual it looks great and has some strong images. For all this it gets 7 out 10.THE STORY: Is based on the real events of the murder of 3 civil rights activists in 1964 Mississippi and the subsequent FBI investigation into their deaths. The problem is not with the ongoing story of how the Fed's crack the case.This is fiction based on fact and as a police story it works fine.THE COMPROMISE: 1, the FBI. J.Edger Hoover in 1964 was possibly the most powerful man in the country, with a file on everyone of importance or power.The FBI was his private fiefdom. Mr.Hoover believed Martin Luther King was a Communist and had no sympathy for the Civil Rights Movement.This is mentioned in one small line of script.The Bureau would have to go after murderers but was certainly on no crusade. Mr.Hoover detested the Kennedys and only kept his job because he had enough info to destroy them.So how the Defoe character, as a Kennedy man , got beyond a filing job is hard to say. Mr.Hoover used Hollywood to create the myth of the G-man ,this myth is still alive and kicking in this film.The Gene Hackman character had been a Mississippi sheriff and obviously part of a Bureau dirty tricks squad and we are expected to believe he has a bleeding heart under his badge. What would have made it interesting if his character was more truthful.The FBI was an all white agency and it certainly was not politically correct.Mr Hoover's views were no secret so rascism would certainly not effect anybody'career.Again this is hinted at in his speech about his father. 2,the KKK, It seems the whole white community in the South is a member which oversimplifies the situation a lot. Also, it does not show the main cause of the hatred was the Southern establishment,the wealthy landowners who encouraged the politicians,the police and judiciary to preach segregation as a classic measure of divide and rule of the poor- whites and African-Americans. It also ignores the fact that segregation had been twisted into the very fabric of the Southern states post- Confederacy identity. 3,the African-Americans, The docile passivity,gospel singing over ashes of churches and the lack of anger is patronising in the extreme.The Civil rights movement was born in South and the churches were its most vocal advocates.Maybe if this film had been made in the 70's rather than the 80's these major background issues would not have been ignored.",

            "content": "Shocking, powerful, disturbing, upsetting and downright aggravating. All these words describe Alan Parker's film of the terrible injustice that was inflicted upon the Negro population in Mississippi, 1964. Though this was hardly an isolated incident. The fact is, white people have been oppressing minorities for as long as man can remember, and not just the African Americans who were captured and enslaved back in the 18th and 19th centuries. White man has marched through innumerable countries, taking over completely, and then either driving out or killing off the indigenous people. India, Australia, South Africa and North America are just a few examples.I do not believe the decent people of today ought to apologise for the actions of their forefathers, as much as they should be determined that equality rules this small planet we all share. Everyone hails from the same supreme Creator, who chose for his own reasons to colour our skins differently, and separate us into cultures. That does not mean we have the right to harm or kill those whom we fear, envy or otherwise do not understand. Jesus asks us to love one another as He love us. What we do to one another must make Him weep. And remember, Jesus was born an olive-skinned Jew, not a white Anglo-Saxon.Parker has fashioned a film which ruthlessly drives home the point that even if racism and bigotry is taught, or a learned behaviour, that it in no way can or should be tolerated nor condoned. It is as ugly as sin, and perhaps one of the most malignant and self-destructive illnesses of humankind, which threatens to eat away the very fabric of humanity even now, on the eve of the 21st century.Gene Hackman gives one of his best performances (possibly ever), as FBI agent Rupert Anderson, a tough old Mississippi boy who recognises racism for what it is, a disease. He'll stop at nothing, including making the rules up as he goes, to halt the injustice and bring the culprits in. Alan Ward is his by the book partner (played with true conviction by the ever underrated Willem Dafoe), a young ex-Justice Department hot shot whose aggressive passion is overshadowed only by his strong regard for Bureau procedure. These two leads are nothing less than outstanding. Entire support carries great weight too, with Frances McDormand, Brad Dourif, R. Lee Ermey and Gailard Sartain all leaving marked impressions. Trevor Jones provides a most effective music score, Gerald Hambling some expert editing, while the costume design team and art crew (lead by Philip Harrison and Geoffrey Kirkland) reproduce this turbulent time very convincingly.Chris Gerolmo's script (the historical accuracy of which is hotly disputed) does not paint a picture of purely good versus evil. There are no clear black and white boundaries depicted here, no innocents, just much grey area. But it's perfectly clear who the defenceless victims are. Maybe Gerolmo wrote this in the hope of educating us. Perhaps he hopes, as I do, that racism will one day be merely an ugly stain in history. Yet as of today, 1995, this is not so.Sunday, October 8, 1995 - VideoPowerful, powerful drama of the atrocity of racial abuse in America's deep south. Scripter Chris Gerolmo pulls no punches in his controversial tale and director Alan Parker (\"Midnight Express\") has a hard hitting style that will rivet you.Trevor Jones' music is poundingly effective and editor Gerald Hambling is precise and efficient. Best thing about this great film is the \"tour de force\" performances from Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe, each bringing to life two very different federal agents, both of whom are determined to put away the men responsible for murdering an African-American boy and two Jewish social workers in Mississippi.This team of experts have created a must see, compelling picture which will leave an indelible impression.Tuesday, January 14, 1997 - Video",

People like that, communities like that still exist. 'Mississippi Burning' raises the question of where it started and how it happens. Is racism taught/learned? In a dialogue between McDormand's Mrs. Pell and Hackman's Anderson, she pretty much sums up what living among hatred can do. Even though she's good-hearted and not a racist, she married one. Furthermore, even the law, takes the side of such people and how many years did it take for it to support and protect equal rights? Meanwhile those who fight, continue to be victims of hate.Parker's direction and Gerolmo's writing are first rate. 'Mississippi Burning' has a very earthy look. The sets, props and costumes look authentic. Gene Hackman is superb as the man who's seen a lot and is yet determined to get to the end. Willem Defoe is great as the idealist copper. Frances McDormand is excellently restrained. The rest of the cast does well too.There have been numerous films made on similar themes but there's something about 'Mississippi Burning's rawness that draws you in.",

The performances were all excellent with (for me), Gene Hackman standing out; although I thought Willem Dafoe was very good and Brad Dourif was excellent as the loathsome Deputy Pell.

Despite the fact that we were 14 and the film is rated 18 over here in the UK, which was totally illegal and would never be allowed now. The other thing I remember was Trevor Jones' really cool-sounding Ry Cooder inspired score.Since this film was loosely based on the 1964 killings of 3 Civil Rights activists, one of whom only got sentenced a few days ago, 40 years after the crime, I thought it would be appropriate to check the film out again.It's got a good story and is well acted, especially by Hackman, who is one of my fave actors (Dafoe is too but he's not in much these days). They play two FBI Agents, who don't get on (a popular clich\u00e9 at the time), down in a backwoods southern town looking for three kids who have probably been killed by evil KKK members.The villains are despicable and Brad Dourif once again uses his wild eyes to great effect. But I was a little disappointed that none of them really got what they deserved (even though in real life it took 40 years to get justice) and got let-off with minor sentences, none of them over 10 years for the brutal killing of three people and all the mass-destruction and arson they did.I was let-down by the ending and really wanted more red-neck, dirt-faced, hicka-billies getting their heads kicked in.

Alan Parker directs this fictionalization of a true-life chapter in which determined F.B.I. men took on the Ku Klux Klan in 1964 after three Civil Rights workers disappeared while driving through a small redneck town in Mississippi. Parker puts the squeeze on us right from the start, omitting few horrors, eventually equating a quest for truth and justice to a violent surge of tables-turning vigilantism (as if there was no other way to succeed here). Since the lawmen in Jessup County have blood on their hands, and the black folks are too scared to speak for fear of retaliation by the whites, the F.B.I. choose to play hardball (impersonating hooded Klansman and taking on the sect's weakest members--even threatening to castrate the mayor!). This third-act revolution certainly gets the audience's blood pumping, while Trevor Jones' score sees to it that we're pounded over the head with suspenseful anticipation. But what happened to the Civil Rights Movement within the movie's time-frame? Surely it didn't disintegrate while this investigation went on? Parker scuttles it for the sake of good old melodrama. In the end, his film is just a well-made racial potboiler, though Gene Hackman's work as underling to Special Agent Willem Dafoe is top-notch (it is perhaps one of Hackman's best performances). Supporting cast also strong, and technically the picture is a superior piece of goods, but it won't be anyone's favorite movie. The spectrum here is narrow, and the statistics at the finale, rushed along, have no dramatic impact whatsoever. **1/2 from ****",

As racial tensions rise in a state which still has segregation, the local police department are implicated and the case becomes a media frenzy. Can the feds find the missing men and prove what happened ?Mississippi Burning is an incendiary movie. It doesn't worry about whom it offends and it doesn't shy away from the most horrible aspects of its drama. It presents the good old Jim Crow redneck South in a manner guaranteed to upset pretty much everybody, and leaves itself wide open to criticism on a lot of fronts; why do the heroes have to white, why do the cops all have to be Ku Klux Klan members, why do the feds resort to exactly the kind of hateful violence and intimidation they're there to put an end to, do we really need to see people beaten, lynched and humiliated every ten minutes, and what qualifies British director Parker to depict American society in so negative a way ? All these are legitimate complaints, but the answer to them all is pretty simple - that's just the way things were. Segregation was a way of life. Black voter registration in places like (fictitious) Jessup County was almost negligible. The movie's key exchange is when Hackman says, \"If I were a Negro I'd probably think the same way they do.\", and Dafoe retorts, \"If you were a Negro, nobody would give a damn what you thought.\". It takes two points of view - Dafoe's idealism and Hackman's easy-going pragmatism - and turns them into each other, with McDormand as the lynch-pin in the middle, and all three performances are terrific. The supporting cast is very strong, with Dourif and Rooker in particular as two of the scariest cops in any movie. Peter Biziou's bright day / dark night photography (which won an Oscar) in authentic rural Mississippi locations adds to the tension, as does the grim score by Trevor Jones. It's an unpleasant film, but a brilliant one and no matter how you may react to it, it forces you to evaluate your own feelings about the issues and to recognise that America has always been a country with a huge gulf between the haves and the have-nots. Loosely based on the real-life Chaney-Goodman-Schwerner murder case of 1964 in Neshoba County, albeit with much dramatic licence. This was the third in a great trio of strange and powerful dramas Parker made in the eighties (the other two being Birdy and Angel Heart), and is amongst his best work.",

I lost count of the amount of times I thought to myself either 'thank god we don't live in a world like this anymore' or 'we're fortunate if the racists were based on real characters, that they'd probably be dead by now, or if not then not too far off it'.Every aspect of the segregation & bigotry was pathetic. I'm ashamed that this was as recent as one generation ago. I know racists are still in this world, but I can only see watching this film as being positive as having a positive bearing on the issue. It asks the question everyone has pondered on. Where does the hatred come from?Children will play and talk to anyone. Black, white, chinese, Jews, anyone. Unless they're manipulated, generally by adults (parents) or some form of media.The best thing with this film is that the public of Mississippi were shown to be absolute morons. The scene where the reporters questioned them, to which their replies were \"well they're different to us & don't wash\" or anything that came out of the judges' gob, was so laughable, it wasn't worth taking seriously. So I can't see how anyone can question that the non FBI whites came out positively in this film.Great acting too from Dafoe, Hackman & McDormand.One previous commenter here, claimed that if you enjoyed this film you're a closet racist & as bad as the people in the film & the ones that made it. That's exactly the sort of imbecillic extremist comment & reason why the problem of racism will probably never be completely eradicated in our lifetimes.Fair enough, the FBI may have been seen as the heroes & problem solvers and not the black townfolk. I don't know US / Mississippi history well enough to comment on how accurate or factual that is, but I would guess that the truth was bent considerably and the negroes did far more for racial problems than this film suggests, but to label people racist for enjoying this film, is ignorant & childish.So people who enjoy films about drugs are all crack addicts eh? People who enjoy a film about drink driving or joyriding are as bad as them in the story? No. Hopefully they'd never consider doing any of the above after watching it & they'd have the brains to form their own opinions. OK, there'll always be one or two of the braindead who'd slip through the net, but most people would be ok.Just because you enjoy a film doesn't mean you're sitting there nodding your head in agreement & chuckling away throughout as if it's Airplane.

Superb performances by Gene Hackman and William Dafoe guides the film into showing the hatred that the Caucasian residents of this Mississippi county have in general towards non-whites, save a few of them, and even in those interviews, it's obvious that those who don't show hate still have racist views You certainly could write a miniseries about every aspect of the horrible murders that took place in 1964, but for a two hour theatrical movie, one perspective has to guide the movie in presenting one side of historical fact that has had many sides, a lot of heroes, a bit of fabrication, yet not enough explored.There's a brilliant moral provided by a young Frances McDormand as the wife of the very bigoted sheriff, Brad Dourif. Quite a contrary for Dourif to the role of the bomb making supporter of Howard R. Rollins fighting injustice in \"Ragtime\" just a few years before this. McDormand is obviously scared of her powerful husband, just as most of the 5000 black citizens are of the local law, at first, refusing to reveal what they know, that is until they decided that they've had enough. It takes a courageous young black boy to tell the even younger witness to a bombing to reveal to Hackman and Dafoe what he knows, and an injustice in court really gets the fire started.Powerfully directed by Alan Parker and beautifully photographed by Peter Biziou (who got this film's only Oscar), this is a film about a grave injustice. Hackman's character has his own racial issues that are just below the surface, but he's disgusted by the violence he sees in spite of that, and this is one of his greatest of many outstanding performances. Dafoe is less showy, and the subtlety of his performance makes him equally as strong, seeing the situation in a far different angle than his colleague. This stands the test of time for a topic that would be controversial in any year and have its detractors regardless of their feelings on the subject.

            "content": "Based on a true story. In 1964 Mississippi three civil right workers (2 whites, 1 black) disappear without a trace. FBI agents come to investigate--southern Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) and straight-laced by the book Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe). Anderson knows the south and the racism and believes in fighting dirty. Ward wants to go by the book and is a calm influence. They soon realize that the workers may be dead--and the town is covering it up.This received tons of negative publicity when it came out. It was based on a real life case and people said this movie distorted the facts or told outright lies. People don't seem to realize this is a FICTIONAL movie! It's not a documentary and doesn't pretend to be. It just uses the case as a starting point to show the ugly racism and hatred back then in Mississippi. It's VERY well made but somewhat disturbing to watch. There's plenty of swearing and a certain \"n\" word is used constantly.It's an important movie...but it never connected with me emotionally. I WAS horrified to see what went on then and LOVED seeing the white guys getting it at the end...but I found it simplistic. All the white guys (save FBI agents) are ignorant vicious southerners who HATE blacks. All the black people just sit back and take all the violence directed at them without even attempting to fight back. How about all those freedom marches that happened back then? The clashes between black and white? They never happened? Turning the whites into monsters and all the blacks into victims was not the way to go. It distorts what the civil rights movement was like. I was always kept at a distance. The violence was strong and horrific (as it should be) but it never moved me. Still this is worth catching. Hackman is outstanding in his role (and was nominated for an Academy Award) and Frances McDormand is great in her too few scenes. Dafoe is a disappointment. He plays his character TOO straight-laced and unemotional. I got annoyed with him rather than cheering him on. Everybody else does great. This is far from a perfect film but it shows us a somewhat accurate portrayal of 1964. I'm glad this is being shown in high schools and colleges. I give it an 8.",

As is often the case there are several films in one here, a film of 'issues', a thriller and over and above all of this a delicate understated love story between Hackman and MacDormand. Excellent.",

The idea (one hopes) was to make a powerful, topical docudrama, but the result is an ugly, artificial, irresponsible exploitation of an actual civil rights crisis, condescending to blacks (condemning their treatment at their expense) and elevated out of all proportion by a false sense of prestige. This is true tabloid cinema, not far removed from one of Chuck Bronson's 'Death Wish' scenarios, with enough burnings, beatings and lynchings to satisfy even the most unrepentant redneck, and with the gall to suggest that the most effective answer to bigotry is to adopt attitudes and methods even more violent than those of the Klan. A first-rate cast is totally wasted by Chris Gerolmo's one-dimensional screenplay (and not for the first time: see 'Miles From Home'). If a film insists on asking questions like, \"where does it come from, all this hatred?\" the least it can do is attempt to provide a legitimate answer.",

            "content": "I was never aware of how big an effect such a movement like the \u0091KKK' had on America, even the world. But thanks to a movie brought to us by director Alan Parker, called \u0091Mississippi Burning', I was not only able to learn about such big events in one of \u0091America's big town' histories, I was also able to appreciate how bad it \u0091turned' some people in this world. While \u0091Mississippi Burning' might have some aspects that will disturb some people, it is a \u0091gritty police drama' that I feel cannot and should not be missed.\n1964: Three young civil rights workers - two white, one black - disappear on a dark Mississippi back road, sparking off one of the largest FBI manhunts in history. Two FBI agents, with very different backgrounds, join forces to solve this seemingly impossible case, a case that ignited a controversy so bloody, it shocked the world.   \u0091Mississippi burning' is a wonderful movie that recreates a time in America's history, a history I am sure that the country would rather forget. Yet I feel it is important that we learn about such historical events, as we can learn from the old times and how they have changed our life. \u0091MB's' story was extremely well written by Chris Gerolmo. What I liked most about it, was how game it was in showing the really confronting issues that I am sure were part of Mississippi in \u00911964'. At no stage does it shrug away from any disturbing issues, including such ideals as the KKK, the media hype in Mississippi and the important investigation that both Anderson and Ward want to solve. But director Alan Parker, brought out the stories great tension particularly well. I also feel it is Parker's unique directing style that allows us, as the audience, to see what is going on in Mississippi burning. Such tensions as the racist's ideals of the KKK, the way the media are consumed by the investigation of the missing civil rights workers and even the different ways both Ward and Anderson do their job, are all very memorable points from the film and this is the good work of Parker. The start and end of the film I feel are Parker's delicate touch as director, beautifully done and will be sketched in my memory for a longtime to come.    Yet the acting talent in the film is also of a great highlight here. The main performers are agents Anderson (Gene Hackman) and Ward (Willem Defoe). Both are great in the roles that they played, but both are very different personalities, which cause them problems on the job. This only adds to the movies great tension. I mean it is easy to tell that both officers want to get to the bottom of this important case, but do it in such different ways. One goes by the book, getting in many hundreds of men to crack the case, while the other wants a smaller investigation, walking the town of Mississippi upsetting town folk, all in the aid of justice. I love the chemistry that Hackman and Defoe shared onscreen considering that both are playing opposite characters, as their relationship is vital to the final makeup of the film. Hackman's true acting talents come out here, however before seeing Defoe in \u0091MB', I felt that he was an ordinary sort of actor, but in this film he has proved to me he has some acting ability. Yet the supporting cast was also of the highest quality. Mrs. Pell (Frances McDormand) is great in her role. She is a person that is cared for by Agent Anderson, which is another great part of the movie's story, and is a pivotal character in the investigation. With Mrs. Pell, you get the feeling that she hates not only her life, but what is going on in Mississippi, with her quote that she sobs to Anderson about hatred, just captivating.\nShe is married to corrupt cop, Deputy Clinton Pell (Brad Dourif), who has a smug smile and is not the greatest of policeman. Dourif's character is involved in one of the more tense scenes of the movie, when Anderson threatens him while being in the barber shop, a favourite of mine. Other good members of the supporting cast include Clayton Townley (Stephen Tobolowsky), Frank Bailey (Michael Rooker), who is brought to his knees by Anderson and Mayor Tilman (R. Lee Ermey). Other interesting scenes in \u0091Mississippi Burning' include the events that show the three civil rights boys being harassed by the cops, you have all the media hype created by the FBI investigation which was great, and the racial tension created by the KKK and their hatred towards the black people of Mississippi, with the burning of one black family's home, quite disturbing. The motel scene is very dramatic, and shows that these two agents are in a very dangerous situation. The diner scene is another truly remarkable scene to see being played out. It is hard to believe that white and coloured people had such big divisions, like this movie shows.\nLook \u0091Mississippi Burning' is a repugnant sort of movie at time, and could make you feel rather sick, considering that this movie's story is based on true events, making it difficult watch. However, this film makes me happy, considering that I live in a country that has democracy, an important ingredient in these times of multiculturalism. The music of MB is really thrilling, chilling and dramatic, and makes the movie's story even better. I feel that MB deserves all the praise that it gets, and it is no wonder that it had so many nominations for academy awards, winning one (for its cinematography by Peter Biziou). If you are looking for a really dramatic and entertaining movie then \u0091Mississippi Burning' is the movie that I highly recommend for you.CMRS gives \u0091Mississippi Burning': 5 (Brilliant Film)",

            "content": "Based on the true story of three civil rights workers' murders, Alan Parker's \"Mississippi Burning\" is a fictionalized dramatization of the investigation, conducted by two opposite FBI agents, both remarkably played by Willem Dafoe and Gene Hackman.Defoe is the young Ward, a bureau-procedure oriented 'Kennedy boy' while Hackman is the older Anderson, less direct, but wiser and subtler in his approach. A Southerner himself, he understands the necessity of charming and sweet-talking the close-mouthed people of Jessup County, whose mentalities echo the dustiness of their town. Their antagonism is North vs. South in microcosm in the sad historical and geographical context of two cultures coexisting in an atmosphere of segregation, fear, and violence, all of them, one-sided. This tension creates a constantly anxious feeling as to plunge us into the dark and swampy context of Mississippi, 1964 \u0085 appearing on a black screen while gunshots are fired.Through \"Mississippi Burning\", one of the best films of the 80's, Alan Parker delivers a profoundly humanistic message inviting people not to understand, but to be able to understand. And I can understand how white people would find some matter to criticize from the unsympathetic portrayal of the South as I can understand how black people would feel offended by their depiction as passive victims only saved by the providential intervention of the North. But this overlooks that the most touching character played by Frances McDormand is a Southerner, born in Jessup and not only she's sweet and loving but under the caring influence of Anderson, will give him crucial information. As it would be overseeing the part that black people played in the film, the anger expressed during the heart-breaking eyes-opening eulogy, the courage of Aaron, the little boy, and the people who defended their rights with what were at hands.I wasn't even twelve when I watched \"Mississipi Burning\" for the first time with my Dad, a Sunday night, and something really affected me, I guess it was my first mature introduction to racism in movies. It touched something so deep inside me that I couldn't help but think \"This is so wrong!\" Besides innocence, there was also a sort of genuine rationality speaking, \"how could even people do that?\" But I guess I was also guilty of a patronizing attitude as if I was happy for the poor victims to be helped, denying the significant role they played in this historical fight for Civil Rights in 1964. And maybe this is why I always watched and re-watched that film whenever I had this opportunity, almost as if I needed to always 'get' more from it, and to appreciate in the 'right way', to be 'able to understand'.And now, it's not the kid speaking but the young man, who 17 years after, learned \u2013and I think it's an improvement- to put things into perspective. I watched the film again, and as you know how it happens, you have some particular scenes that get stuck in your memories, not the most impacting necessarily. I am not going to enumerate all of them, but there is one little moment particularly insightful. When Stephen Toboloswky as the leader of the Klan, was giving his speech about the Anglo-Saxon Christian Pride and the necessity of racial segregation to protect Mississippi's identity, this message full of hatred ignited the cheers of an illuminated audience. And the moment I remembered the most was this cute little blonde girl, applauding, with a sweet but creepy hypnotized look. She's like proud to belong to this people who're \u2013in her mind- the best in the world.Later, it's like a translation into words of that simple moment. Frances McDormand talks about the trivialization of hatred, the way it's taught from cradle to grave, based on a fallacious reading of the Bible. This is not an alibi for racism, not at all, but a powerful attempt to prevent the film from Manichaeism, it's not plain racism, it's about ignorance, bigotry and hatred, and how Ward and Anderson discover the roots of this hatred, incarnated by the heinous face of the most detestable racist, admirably portrayed by Michael Rooker, and the hypocritical sneaky eyes of Brad Dourif, as the Klan-connected Sheriff's Deputy. The casting is full of familiar faces including Gailard Startain as the Sheriff and R. Lee Ermey as the Mayor, another reason for me to re-watch the film, although Hackman's performance tops them all.How the pride to belong to a group can be perverted by another corollary sentiment: to be superior. It's all a matter of perspective, and it's interesting that this comes from the director of a movie I truly admire and that I always defended, \"Midnight Express\" where the only way to overcome the racist simplification was to see things from each one's perspective. And \"Mississippi Burning\" is a remarkable hymn for peace and understanding driven by an extremely well-written script, and the dynamic between Ward and Anderson and the way the investigation will progress through the use of each one method. Ward believes in the law, Anderson, to get in the same level than your enemies, both are right and wrong in the same time, but their antagonism is mainly because of misunderstanding.Misunderstanding \u0085 whether it's ignorance, or \"being poor\", some people need to believe in 'being better'. And while some others believe it's 'morally wrong', they don't change the situation either, maybe we're all part of a hypocrisy surrounding the theme of racism, maybe we all are, not against a racial community, but it could be against a social, sexual or any category etc. We need to have one to feel better than.At the end, black and white sing in unison in a cemetery, a beautiful and positive note undermined by my vision of today's reality, and the way racism is still present, in so many other places in the world, that unlike 1964, are already being forgotten",

Granted, the real story about the actual event is heavily dramatized but it is really only to the benefit of the affect the movie has. There are superb performances of both Hackman, Dafoe and McDormand but they only service the story, which is rare in a Hollywood movie. No grand speeches about racial prejudices, just quiet observations.Where it gets its points across more loudly is in the violence. Be warned, this is a disturbing movie and should not be seen by children. However, the violence is far from gratuitous. Some people on this posts have complained that the white people look like ignorant, violent bastards here and the black people look too noble. That may be true but think about it, would you really have seen this if the black people were as vicious as the whites. You have to have somebody to admire in a mainstream film. Just look at all the films from the 30s and 40s? Was that more to you liking than people portrayed here? I think that people who complain about the white characters here should really think about what they are seeing.

When three Civil Rights activists disappear in Mississippi, two FBI agents are sent in to solve the case. But how can they do so, when the bigotry is so rampant?

Two FBI agents are sent down south to investigate the murders and a hellish hornets nest is disturbed with far-reaching consequences. Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe convincingly play the contrasting lawmen as they constantly butt heads on how to conduct the investigation - one a by the book worker the other a no holds barred enforcer. The scenes of beatings, lynchings, tears, arson, explosions, violence and murder move and disturb making one face the raw naked face of human nature and questioning one's own. While the film may leave a bitter taste with the current climate of ubiquitous political correctness there's no denying the film's moral and artistic impact. Moving and unforgettable, this is one of the few films where the medium elevates history to enduring importance and relevance.",

Even though my English teacher was a Sunday School teacher, that tells you nothing in the Bible Belt when we are taught to love everyone as Jesus did, and in actions, ignore black people as though they didn't exist. So, this tale of Mississippi white trash, including the higher political officials, didn't include the class of folks most responsible for the evil done to our former slaves' children: the educated white middle-class.  Even Mississippi has some of those folks (e.g., William Faulkner).  We see the injustice spread from the mayor to the sheriff to the judges, just as we are seeing it today at the federal level with a Supreme Court that justifies handcuffs arrest for little or no reason, and puts a thief into the president's office.\"Mississippi Burning\" features Gene Hackman, doing his thing, including seducing psychologically the deputy's wife for the good of the service.  And it doesn't back off from the fact that it was the residents of those towns in Mississippi that got hurt when the FBI came visiting, almost as much hurt as the 3 civil rights workers received.  At Inauguration Day 2001, as a protester facing the police cordons, I got a taste of how quickly a peaceful protest can result in violence and jail-time.  But once you understand that jail itself is not shameful when the jailers are criminals, being arrested doesn't seem so bad.  You'll see, however, what happens when the innocent jailed are released into the night with full complicity of the law enforcement people in that small Mississippi town.Great movie, and I wish it weren't so truthful about my part of the country. The look on those ignorant Mississippi people, and the sweet looks of the children there showed just how hatred is taught.  There are great lessons to be learned, and every schoolchild should be shown this.",

            "review_title": "A touching, tragic, and superbly acted film concerning racism.",
            "content": "\"Mississippi Burning\" has to be one of the greatest films I have scene to depict racism during the Civil Rights Era. Directed by Alan Parker and released in 1988, this film is without a doubt great at not only being a well acted drama concerning racism, but something of a thriller as well. Watching this movie is watching one of the most ingenious and emotional crime dramas to be made in the past twenty years, and perhaps even longer than that. All though it was overshadowed by \"Rain Man\" when it was released in 1988, that does not dampen just how impactive \"Mississippi Burning\" truly is.Based on the true account of three civil rights workers (two white and one black) being murdered by the Ku Klux Klan, the story follows fictional FBI agents Anderson (Gene Hackman) and Ward (Willem Dafoe) as they try to prove the culpability of Klan members in the murder. Do not expect this movie to closely follow exact history records, however, as you will end up being disappointed. Instead, the movie bases itself loosely in historical accuracy and shows the evils of racism in its own way. Still, many instances depicted in this movie really did happen, such as the KKK bombing the houses and churches of black people, but actual names, places, and dates are not adhered by. Actually, though, I think it was wise for the movie not to adhere itself so close to history, as it gives the film more to work with.A popular criticism of \"Mississippi Burning\" is that it makes the federal agents look more like heroes to Civil Rights workers than they actually were. I can agree with that point to an extent in the film, but with the great performances the movie gives, you should not be wasting time on noticing that issue. Gene Hackman gives off another superb performance in this movie as federal agent Rupert Anderson, who I feel should go down as one of cinema's greatest law enforcement individuals. In the movie Anderson is actually from Mississippi himself, where he worked as a town sheriff. Due to this, Anderson knows how things work in the South concerning crimes against Civil Rights Workers and black people, and is not afraid to get his hands dirty to see a crime get solved. Anderson often clashes with his by-the-book boss, Ward, because of this. As for Willem Dafoe's portrayal of federal agent Ward, it is solid, but sometimes it is overdone with \"good guy\" themes. Even though I am sure that there were FBI agents that wanted to help with the Civil Rights cause, would any FBI agent in that time period really be allowed to bring down over a hundred federal agents and men from the naval reserves (as he does) into Mississippi in order to help solve a murder case? Unlikely, but as I said, to quibble on such a menial matter is to lose sight of the grand scope of the film.Another stand-out performance in the movie is given off by Frances McDormand as the quiet, subdued, and seeming battered wife of town deputy Clinton Pell (Brad Dourif), and the owner of a beauty parlor. Clinton Pell is a member of the KKK himself, and even participated in the shootings of the three Civil Rights workers. Playing this man's wife, McDormand shows how her character truly disapproves of everything her husband stands for, but is simply too scared or perhaps does not think enough of herself to break free of his violent domination. She plays a very important part in the movie with one Anderson, but I should not spoil anymore of the plot for those that have never seen the film. Many will argue that characters like Clinton Pell are over-exaggerated for the time, but that is not true, as even today I can find men and woman who share many of his same thoughts.Along with the tremendous acting comes excellent cinematography. Every shot wonderfully captures the look and feel of a small Mississippi town in that age, with dusty streets, small diners, general stores, farms, and houses (some ramshackle, some nice). Camera work in this film makes you feel that you are in Mississippi yourself.My review of this movie simply does not do the film any justice. One must watch the movie to feel all of the strong emotions within it. Upon my initial viewing of this film, I was shaken and disturbed by the racism that is presented. It was smart for this movie to not preach how racism is evil, but to simply show racism in its purest form and allow the viewer to be the judge.Like I have said throughout this review, some minor issues plague \"Mississippi Burning\". Those minor issues are what made me give this movie nine stars instead of ten. Still, I recommend this movie very highly, and even with some of its minor flaws, if you have any sense of what a good movie is it will surely capture you with assets that definitely outweigh the flaws.",

            "content": "Well, \"Mississippi Burning\" can be acquitted on one charge, at least - it doesn't glorify the FBI, which, as an organisation, did all it could to hamper the civil rights movement.  The heroes are two agents assigned to cover a particular case.  They may or may not be in sympathy with the organisation to which they belong; my guess is that they aren't.  There's certainly something curious about making the heroes of this particular story white FBI agents, but this isn't in itself objectionable - at least, not under the circumstances.But the film is still morally repulsive, for reasons that it worries me that no-one has pointed out.  When Anderson and Ward travel to Mississippi to investigate the murder of civil rights activists, they run into a stone wall.  Whites are too bigoted to talk to them and blacks are too terrified of reprisals.  If they charge a white man with a crime of violence they know that no local jury will convict and no local judge will sentence.  What can they do?They try for prosecution in a federal court, obviously - so far, so good. And to make absolutely certain that their charges stick they play dirty: they recruit thugs and extract information under torture and the threat of extreme violence.  If there's a single character whose actions we're meant to approve of, it's Anderson (invested with all the charm Gene Hackman has to offer) - and we see him wielding a razor blade, threatening to slash someone's throat.  He's not, in this scene, seriously attempting to find anything out, or even trying to coerce his victim into cooperating.  It's a mere display of strength and will.  When I first saw \"Mississippi Burning\" I was so infuriated by the racism that I managed to persuade myself (reluctantly, I hope) to cheer him on.  I was nearly sixteen.  I'm glad I don't have to admit to having been any older.  Looking at the movie today, the fascist nastiness which I had talked myself into overlooking turns out to be the dominant element.",

You get a real sense of how difficult life in a segregated state must have been in those unenlightened times, and this combined with powerful performances by Hackman and Defoe means this isn't want you'll want to stop till the end.As fun as it is seeing a bunch of racist yahoos get their just desserts though, I can't help but feel something is missing here. Like the bigots in question... Wouldn't it be better if they were a tad more fleshed-out, rather than simply hate-spewing caricatures of humanity? Also, the by-the-books cop vs the maverick officer thing is a tad unoriginal. Still fun to watch, but definitely a little laboured.There is also a distinct lack of a Black voice in the film... most of the African American cast just hang about in the background with the odd line which adds little to the plot. Speaking of which... the 'cunning plan' Hackman concocts to jail the secretive rednecks at the end is both far-fetched and highly unethical.

            "content": "It's rare that you find a movie with so many sobering moments that stay with you when the movie's finished, but Mississippi Burning is full of those moments. Some are just sobering - like the shot of the two water fountains, one brand spanking new, marked \"Whites\" and one old and run down, marked \"Coloreds.\" Some scenes are unsettling, with overly racist and obnoxious things being said - \"niggers don't even take baths and they stink!\" Some scenes are frightening - little children laughing and applauding along with their parents at Ku Klux Klan rallies. Then there's the violence - lynchings and beatings and murders of local blacks. This isn't a movie for the feint of heart. It isn't a \"pleasant\" movie at all, but it's certainly a powerful one.It's loosely based on the murders of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964, and it revolves around the two FBI agents leading the investigation - Ward (Willem Dafoe) and Andersen (Gene Hackman). This was a powerful performance from both men. Hackman I expected that from, because I consistently like Gene Hackman's work, and he was nominated for an Oscar for this role. Dafoe I have had mixed reactions to over the years, but he was very good in this. Ward and Andersen are both FBI agents, but very different in their approach. Ward is a Northerner, and wants to do things by the book. Andersen is a southerner who knows that \"by the book\" won't cut it when dealing with racists and the Klan. Watching them work out their relationship is interesting.There's a large number of secondary characters, all of whom have significant roles to play in the unfolding of the story. The most important of them is probably \"Mrs. Pell\" (played by Frances McDormand, who was nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar) - the wife of one of the sheriff's deputies implicated in the murders. Her Oscar nomination aside, I admit that I wasn't really taken with the character of Mrs. Pell and the implication of some type of friendship or relationship brewing with Andersen, although the scene in which her husband deals with his \"problem at home\" (as one of his good ole boy buddies called her) is brutal, and another of those scenes that stays with you.The name of the movie refers to the name of the FBI investigation, although it's put to good use as there are repeated scenes throughout the movie of the burning of black churches and homes, with a few burning crosses thrown in as well. It is unsettling and at times unpleasant to watch, but it's also very good. (8/10)",

'Alien 4' has grown on me, 'Thin Red Line' has, 'Wizards' has, even 'Pink Floyd', but this one sank upon revisiting it.Parker's stuff is technically competent, I'll grant him that, and he has a decent grip on production values--which is more than I can say for most directors--but something wrong is afoot here.  I think Parker frequents the musical genre so he can pass off his razzle-dazzle style without worrying about filmic stimulation.  As compensation, he uses symbolism-loaded \"art\" images.  Watch when the Klan attacks the church, instead of Ollie Stone-style brutality, we get a 'Face/Off' music video.If you're into that sort of thing you'll love his work but I find it thuggish and sanitized (like 'Lord of the Rings').  Honestly, it's editor Gerry Hambling that's made Parker famous, nothing else.The story here is too simple, but get rather interesting when you see the Hoover-Vietnam-King connection.  Do some reading into that later. Storywise, Parker's 'Wall' is better as it mixes past/present, real/fantasy, time/space into one crazy mix.Fortunately, the acting is interesting--Parker really got an unorthodox cast.  Each actor takes two characters to make a new knockoff.  Hackman takes his Doyle from 'Connection' and uses Connery from 'Untouchables'. Dafoe does his Christ with Atticus Finch.  Dourif combines Piter deVries from 'Dune' with Barney Fife.Want some cinematic irony?  Compare this with 'Die Hard'.  Both involve terrorism, xenophobia, and some competent attempts at being cinematic with many elements (flying, explosions, height, night, claustrophobia).  Here the good white guys save the inactive Blacks from the bad white guys.  Boring. At least McTiernan made things interesting: Black cop saves white cop from Nazis.Your favorite Parker will depend on your tendencies, but if you want intelligent Klan bashing, watch 'O Brother'.",

            "content": "Three civil rights activists (2 blacks, 1 white) go missing & presumed murdered by white racists (the Klu Klux Klan) in some small town in the heart of Mississippi during the race protests of 1964 .Enter two FBI men from the North - Hackman (the bad cop, who used to be a town sherrif in the area many years ago but now  hunts bigger fish whether it be within the law or otherwise ) and Willem Defoe (the good cop trying to set the world to rights with the belief that even racists can't be all that evil to want to kill).They investigate the case using the rules laid out by the pragmatic and by-the-book Defoe. But the townsfolk aren't quite so co-operative or helpful and the two agents seem to spend more time arguing with each other over tactics or visiting burnt out homes, farms & churches belonging to the oppressed blacks in the area than getting any nearer to solving the crime.Even with a hundred other FBI agents brought in to help out both Defoe & Hackman find it hard to get witnesses to speak up and offer any leads regarding the three young missing persons.Eventually Hackman befriends the wife of one of the town's police officers (and suspected KKK member), wonderfully played by the ever-dependable Frances McDormand (of Fargo and Blood Simple fame). Through her Hackman learns that most of the police officers and leading townsfolk are KKK members and that the 3 activists were murdered & buried in a nearby quarry pit.With the bodies exhumed all Hackman & Defoe need to close the case are the murderers, but to get what they want they have to play by Hackman's rules this time.....A highly controversial film for its day (1988). Initially it was a certainty to win a host of Academy Awards for its virtuous storytelling. But various black groups protested that the film was flawed,uneven and possibly even racist. They also argued that the film portrayed the black townsfolk as defenceless, ignorant & backward, having to rely on two white FBI agents from out of town to help them win them justice.It is fair to say that they have a point. It struck me that for most of the time the blacks portrayed in the film were blatantly stereotyped as either churchgoers, gospel singers, cotton-pickers or ignorant illiterates.\nThis major complaint coupled with protests from white Southerners angry at being seeing as just a bunch of hick rednecks, ended any realistic chance the film had of winning any award at all.British director, Alan Parker took a very simplistic view of some true events the film is supposedly based on. It is true to say that the acting from both Defoe and especially Hackman is top notch, the photography and film score excellent coupled with the overall pace of the film makes for a very entertaining viewing. However, it is to the content of the film that counts most and this is where Parker's limited knowledge of the civil rights protests in the Deep South during the early 60s is painfully obvious.I would guess that if the film was remade today one of the leads would go to a black actor of the quality of Morgan Freeman (replacing Hackman's character) or Denzel Washington (replacing Defoe's preachy, peace-loving act). At least this would've added far more balance & realism to the film without making it too overtly politically correct. Afterall why should cynical black townsfolk ever want to co-operate with white FBI agents. In their eyes all whites are just the same and to be mistrusted in equal measure.This film could have been better perhaps from an American director rather than from an \"outsider\" looking in. Parker is very much like Ridley Scott at times: all style over content without really understanding what it is he is trying to portray, which is a great shame.If one can forgive these flaws Mississippi Burning is a very good drama. Special mention has to go to the ever-dependable Gene Hackman who returns to form as the no-nonsense former sherrif who knows how the locals tick and isn't about to be fobbed off in the same way as the rather naive & clean-cut Defoe.Overall then, Mississippi Burning, fails to get its message across but entertains us nonetheless. The acting is good, the screenplay stilted and the characterizations are pigeon-holed. But for all that this film is worth a look because even though it is very uneven the main theme of apartheid, oppression & racism between black & white Americans is a good lesson for us all to think about and realise that over the last 30 years nothing much has changed.***/*****",

It is a fictionalized account of the murder of three civil rights activists by the Ku Klux Klan in 1965, a tragic, yet important, period in American history.I only wish the film itself were better.The key problem with this film is the character connections. I just didn't feel connected to any of the characters, they all seemed fairly shallow. Gene Hackman's bad cop, William Defoe's good cop, Francis McDormand's bullied housewife, even Brad Dourif's treacherous deputy sheriff, none of them really had bit of magic required to make the viewer connect with the character. I don't think it's the acting, they all tried to do the best with what they had. I think the fault lies with the writing.I think the writer made a mistake by including too much interaction between the two FBI agents (Hackman & Defoe) and not enough into the interactions between them and the locals, and between the locals themselves. Frankly, the film relies so much on stereotype to create these characters, it's hard to get into them.I also feel they shortchanged the black cast members. They're basically relegated to being beaten around, and singing at church. There's only one important scene involving blacks, the lynching of a father who's only trying to save his cows. Otherwise, they're simply window dressing.I would love to see this film remade by a talented writer/director. Perhaps Spike Lee would love to exchange his New York City backdrop for a deeply Southern one. Now THAT would be a film.8 out of 10. It's still an important story, and a risk for Hollywood, and it deserves props for that. But it could have been better.Barky",

            "content": "The main question looming over the head of Alan Parker's Mississippi Burning is whether or not the film has a moral responsibility to tell its true-life tale of racial hatred and murder in Civil Rights Act- era Mississippi exactly how it happened, or if artistic license grants the creators of the film the right to tell an entertaining story that maintains a powerful message of social injustice and equal rights. I am of the opinion that any film can change events for the sake of a digestible narrative, as long as the facts aren't muddied for the sake of fitting a films own agenda. Like countless old World War II movies that softened the horrors of war or fabricated tales of heroism, a film isn't required to be a moving Wikipedia page as long as its heart is in the right place.Mississippi Burning opens with the brutal slaying of three Civil Rights activists - two white men and one black - by members of the Ku Klux Klan, in an event that would capture the attention of the entire nation back in 1964. Two federal agents are sent in to investigate, Agent Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman), a former Mississippi sheriff well accustomed to the attitudes of the small- town police forces in the state, and determined liberal Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe). Upon arrival, it doesn't take long for the agents to suspect widespread corruption within the police ranks and a possible cover-up. Anderson takes a hands-on approach of mingling with the locals and delivering thinly-veiled threats, while Ward respects rules and rank, bringing in over a hundred new agents to tackle the ever-increasing conspiracy.The idea to tell this story, which is one of the key events that led to the signing of the Civil Rights Act, through the eyes of two white men would be instantly scoffed at nowadays throughout social media, and perhaps rightly so. It is most importantly a story of the suffering of African-Americans, and of their bravery and spirit in taking a stand against it. Yet while Mississippi Burning takes a procedural, buddy- cop movie approach, it highlights how ultimately powerless the agents investigating the case are. Anyone familiar with the story will know that the men responsible for the murders were eventually brought to justice, but this is only one case in a country brimming with racial tension as social integration is introduced. It would take people such as the activists murdered in the film and the many Civil Rights demonstrations carried out in defiance that would ultimately lead to changes.At its best, the film is successful in making you feel extremely angry. As various African-Americans are lynched or attacked leaving a church by gangs carrying weapons, you, along with the bemused Agent Ward, question how such hate for another race can manifest itself within such a large portion of a community. With the FBI becoming increasingly frustrated at the lack of co-operation from the residents of the town, the film somewhat indulgently gives us a scene of Anderson having an off-the-record word with suspected Klan members, particularly Deputy Pell (Brad Dourif) and hot-head redneck Frank (Michael Rooker). It's a punch-the-air moment of badassery, and one of many such scenes that allow the film to be entertaining as well as thought-provoking. It's far from perfect of course, with a shoe-horned romance between Anderson and Pell's suffering wife (Frances McDormand) in particular feeling wholly unnecessary, but this is a powerful and beautifully-made piece featuring one of Hackman's best performances.",

Director Parker creates excellent characters that embody the different perspectives of those that were involved in the civil rights crisis. Whether it is the idealist FBI agent portrayed by DeFoe or the Southern FBIrealist so brilliantly portrayed by Hackman. This movie shows us why peopletried to change the South and why other people tried to preserve that South. The result is a violent and disturbing film, which both educates and entertains. OK, the FBI actually used huge cash payoffs to get Klan members to testify against others in the real case. No, the FBI did not have a black agent that helped them to crack the case.

The chemistry they held was almost so obscure and confusing, it was realistic and some how gives the audience a feel of a real-life partnership.

Some part in this film are just so utterly powerful, it's hard to find any bad things about it. Willem Dafoe gives it his all, and he's a great actor. Of course Gene Hackman is very convincing as the tough agent whos morals outweigh his dedication to the FBI. If you are going to make some sort of statement in a movie, this is the best way I can think to do it. By simply making it a high powered, entertaining motion picture, your message can be widely accepted by its viewer and therefore making your statement known and clear. Good job guys! 8/10",

The level of hatred portrayed was also disturbing because it happened less than forty years ago and in some places In the deep American south such feelings still apply. Although the film is very bleak, the end of the movie does give the viewer hope. The sight of white and black citizens standing together shoulder to shoulder at a funeral actually made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end.

            "content": "\"Hatred isn't something you're born with. It gets taught... At 7 years of age, you get told it enough times, you believe it. You believe the hatred. You live it... you breathe it. You marry it.\"Alan Parker's 1988 film which was nominated for seven Academy Awards is another reminder of what a great career Gene Hackman had, although this time he got to share the spotlight with a pair of other wonderful performances from Willem Dafoe and Frances McDormand. The fact that Mississippi Burning isn't even considered one of Hackman's top ten most popular films just proves how many great films he's made over the span of five decades (he retired from acting in 2004). Since the film was loosely based on a real incident surrounding the disappearance of some civil rights workers in the south during the 60's many people complained that the film wasn't faithful to the story, but Parker never made such a claim and always said his film was a fictional tale of events that could've taken place during the time so I don't see any need to complain about it. Some similarities can be found with the classic film directed by Norman Jewison, In the Heat of the Night, which handles a similar theme about racism. Films like this are important reminders of how dangerous humans can be when they let hate and racism govern their hearts. It is so easy at times to forget those dark moments in our history and act like they never happened, but once in a while we get films like Mississippi Burning that remind us of the horrors of humanity and the sacrifice people made to end them. These are films with important messages which also happen to be well made and count with a stellar cast. Its only Oscar win was for Peter Biziou's wonderful cinematography, but there is so much more worth recommending about this classic from the 80's. The film introduces us to three civil rights workers as they are detained by a police vehicle while they were about to exit a small Mississippi town. The officers begin making all sorts of hateful remarks towards these men and violently shoot them for trying to stir up their quiet and organized segregated town. A few days later, two FBI agents show up in town looking for these disappeared citizens, who they fear have been murdered. Agent Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) is in charge of the operation despite his young age. His partner, Agent Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman), is more experienced and is not afraid to speak his mind about him as someone he believes to be well educated but lacking more field work. Ward likes to do things by the books, but Anderson who was a former Sheriff in a similar Mississippi town knows the mentality of these places and believes his methods won't get them anywhere in a place like this. The Mayor (R. Lee Ermey) isn't pleased with the agents visit because he believes his segregation methods work and that things are run differently here than in the south. The agents learn it quickly while they're trying to collaborate with the local officers. Sheriff Ray Stuckey (Gaylord Sartain) is very protective of his boys, especially of Deputy Clinton (Brad Dourif) and officer Frank (Michael Rooker) who were the officers involved in the murder. It doesn't take the agents too long to realize what happened, but they can't find anyone in town who will speak to them since the victims have been threatened by the KKK. Every time someone seems to be interested in speaking up, they are immediately intimidated by the gang through violent acts. Ward's tactics don't seem to have an effect, but Anderson may have found the perfect ally in Mrs. Pell (Frances McDormand), the Deputy's wife who rejects his actions. The script handles the civil rights case with care and avoids falling into melodramatic territory by remaining gripping and suspenseful. There are plenty of thrills along the way and some violent scenes that are actually less horrifying than the hateful things these men say. It's true that the civil right theme is told through a white's man point of view, but I think it still remains compelling and well intentioned. In the end it becomes entirely a revenge action film, but it's handled in a convincing and realistic way. Hackman, Dafoe, and McDormand are in the center of the movie and they all deliver gripping performances playing off each other extremely well. Brad Dourif and Michael Rooker are given the stereotypical racist characters who are very easy to hate. Rooker seems to be playing the same character from The Walking Dead series only this time he actually acts upon his remarks more than simply being a loud mouth. Hackman and Dafoe are on the same side despite having very different approaches and that difference helps build the tension and relationships in the film. Parker's sensitive direction works in a film with such a controversial subject matter that could be easily manipulated. Mississippi Burning is a classic that shouldn't be missed by fans of Gene Hackman and his impressive career. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

This film tells the story of the follow-up investigation by two FBI guys named Anderson (Gene Hackman) and Ward (Willem Dafoe). Although the triple murder is based on a real-life case, script plot points are mostly fictional.The Anderson and Ward characters are fictional. And it's unfortunate that the writers here portray the FBI as the good guys, which is a distortion of the historical reality. The Mrs. Pell character (Frances McDormand), also is fictional and distracts from the case. While the inclusion of some fiction can be acceptable in real-life stories, since such films are not intended as documentaries, \"Mississippi Burning\" deviates too much from the historical truth, and that's my main criticism of the film.Some have argued that the film is biased because it presents a stereotyped view that all Mississippi Blacks were victims and all Mississippi Whites were villainous. But that's pretty much the way it was back then. Even now, I'm not sure a lot has changed since 1964, though villainy may be more subtle now. Because of the heavy political overtones, some viewers will necessarily be put off by the film's overall message.The visuals are the real strength of the film. Detailed prod design, period costumes, and the casting of local, non-professional actors make the film come alive with a sense of realism. Much of the plot takes place at night, thematically appropriate given that evil redneck thugs terrorized an entire race of people and caused untold suffering.Casting is appropriate, with the possible exception of Willem Dafoe, an actor with an annoying voice. Cinematography is quite good. Colors are highly muted; lighting is fairly low, with night scenes quite dark.\"Where does it come from, all this hatred (toward Blacks)\", asks one character. It comes from the reality that the South never recovered from the Civil War. And all that resentment expressed in 1964 to some extent still exists, some 25 years after \"Mississippi Burning\" was made, and a half-century after the event upon which the film is based. Many Southern Whites just cannot let go of the past. Perhaps they never will ...",

The finale is a predictable inevitability yet it serves greatly in how things turn out to be. The compromise between the two main characters sure makes the unpredictability looks better. The acting is very nice in overall. Gene Hackman sure knows how to handle a hard character like this one. He even can build enough level of ambiguity at the starting points. Willem Dafoe sure can also handle his calm character well.

            "content": "Mississippi burning shows Gene Hackman at his best and at his side is Willem Dafoe who also plays very strong. Mississippi Burning is a dramatic movie made in 1988 directed by the talented Alan Parker (who has also directed Fame and Midnight Express). The lead roles are played by Gene Hackman, Willem Dafoe and Frances McDorman is at her best playing a supporting role. The movie is based on the true story of the murder of three civil rights workers in 1964, so the movie is set in 1964 Mississippi.The movie begins with the three civil rights workers who are brutally murdered; the viewer now already knows that the police are involved. Allan Ward and Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe) are sent to Mississippi to shed some light on the case. The two agents have very different personalities, Rupert Anderson used to be a sheriff in a small Mississippi town, just like the town where they are investigating missing civil right workers, he does not like to do everything by the book, in contrary to Allan Ward, he is a hard working FBI agent who likes to do everything by the book. Not long after they enter the town they see that it will not be easy, the townspeople are very hostile towards them and the KKK is involved, Mr. Ward soon ask for more FBI agents, even when Mr. Anderson thinks it is a bad idea. Soon there are an enormous amount of FBI agents in the small town, but that only makes the townspeople angrier. The KKK set a church for black people on fire to scare the black people into not talking to the FBI, when Ward and Anderson walk into a restaurant and try talking to a black person he says: ''I have nothing to say to you'' but still the townspeople beat him up for talking to people from the FBI. The FBI agents search trough the endless swamps and find the car of the civil rights workers, but they still find no bodies. Agent Anderson feels a connection with the wife of the deputy sheriff and feels that she knows something but she won't tell anything. When Ward lets Anderson do it his way they finally see what really happened.The acting in Mississippi Burning is close to brilliant, Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are both good actors, but together they are brilliant. Gene Hackman is born for the role of an old Mississippi sheriff who knows how it all works. Gene plays very dominant and the scene in the bar where he threatens the townspeople is one of the best moments in the movie, because you don't expect it from him but still it fits him very well. Frances McDorman plays the cop who does everything by the book excellent, even his appearance, the glasses and his pale skin. Especially the scene where Anderson beats someone up in the barber shop you see that this goes against his principles.The music in Mississippi Burnin is phenomenal; there are a lot of gospel songs for example the song by Vesta Williams '' Try Jesus ''. The soundtrack is by Lannie Spann McBride, she made the very powerful song ''Walk On By Faith''. There is also a tune in the film when something bad is about to happen, when you hear it for the first time in the movie recognize the tune immediately, when you hear it you feel uncomfortable and are at the tip of your seat. Also Kitty Wells and Mahalia Jackson have made songs for the movie which are all beautiful.This movie is a beautiful movie with a perfectly cast. The music is very well made and used. Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are a perfect duo and should do more movies together, they fit the term '' good cop bad cop '' perfectly as Gene Hackman really does look as a hardened, bad cop and Dafoe as good cop. What they shouldn't have done was basing it on a real story, because clearly the director didn't want to be restrained, because a lot was different in the movie than what really happened, only a couple of things are historically correct, asides from that it's a must watch, I give this movie an 8 or 9 out of 10, so a small 9 out of ten.",

            "content": "\"One cannot separate economics, political science, and history. Politics is the control of the economy. History, when accurately and fully recorded, is that story. In most textbooks and classrooms, not only are these three fields of study separated, but they are further compartmentalised into separate subfields, obscuring the close interconnections between them.\" - J.W. Smith Most films supposedly \"about racism\" are covertly racist or promote racial stereotypes (\"Monster's Ball\", \"Color Purple\", \"Sayonara\", \"The Blind Side\", Sidney Poitier vehicles etc etc). Alan Parker's \"Missisippi Burning\" is no different (Parker directed the equally dubious \"Midnight Express\" a decade earlier).Loosely based on the real life murders of civil rights workers in Mississippi, the film stars Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe as a pair of FBI agents who journey to Jessup County. Here they interrogate, investigate and trade blows with the local townsfolk, most of whom are KKK members, racist, or believe in a form of white exceptionalism typical of 1960s America. The film takes place in 1964, a year before steps were taken to dismantle America's Jim Crow Laws, which promoted racial segregation and white supremacy.Like most of these films, black characters are marginalised, a white character is our entryway into the tale, the black experience is ignored and white racism is caricatured or treated as a \"personal belief\" rather than a systemic/structural phenomenon. This being Hollywood, racism is also understood entirely as an issue of \"race\" rather than class (racism is a key mechanism for the stabilisation of capitalism and the legitimisation of inequality). Indeed, as the economic forces which cause such things continue to exist today, contemporary society is every bit as racist as it was in the 1960s. Minorities face tougher court sentences, are overwhelmingly sent to wars, there are more black men in prison than were used as slaves at the height of chattel slavery, and minorities dominate homeless/poverty/mental-ill-health/incarceration statistics. And as the core of the system stabilises, new forms of racism are pushed outward, other country's and cultures demonized to foster further accumulation. Ironically, the end result of this is an increased persecution of whites and the middle classes: capitalism has to come for them next. Racism is itself more than an ideology, a belief system or a negative attitude towards others arising out of prejudice. If that alone were the case then racism would be reduced to something which takes place inside human heads. But such an understanding ignores a chief factor behind racism (as well as sexism): Power and the capacity to act. Or as the old civil rights mantra went, \"racism equals prejudice plus power\".In our era, though, the most important factor in reinvigorating a whole new round of global racism is the resurgence of a certain brand of Reaganite conservatism (or neoliberalism), whose hallmark was the reinstatement of laissez-faire economic policies and rhetoric. Subject to such \"unchecked capitalism\", the poor got poorer, the middle class was destroyed, debts exponentially increased, and the great big national Ponzi scheme was forced to go abroad, often violently with wars, Uncle Sam's Mickey Mouse Club desperately sucking up new members for life support. But beyond this, the Reaganite doctrine of inequality gave the official seal of approval to ideas of racial superiority that right-wing extremists had used for years to rationalise the exploitation of minorities. If the economic gap between whites and non-whites was growing, if most non-whites live below the poverty line - well, that just proved that there was a racial component in the free-market's Social-Darwinian selection process; minorities \"deserved\" their poverty because they were \"less fit\" and \"winners\" \"deserved\" their gains because of personal merit, hard work and intelligence. The logical corollary of this is that whites who are \"less fit\" also deserve their poverty.But the most insidious thing about \"Mississippi Burning\" is its valorising of FBI agents, who are painted as moral guardians and heroes of the civil rights era. In reality, the FBI and CIA have always been racist organisations (see Costa Gavras' \"Betrayal\"), responsible for countless unlawful operations against Civil Rights activists, unions and progressive movements. The forces behind numerous assassinations and coups across the world, both parties have the blood of millions on their hands. Indeed, in the period depicted in the film, the FBI would routinely sit back and watch while local mobs or police patrols beat down on gays and blacks, just as after the Civil War blacks were left at the mercy of Southern power/plantation owners by Northern politicians who made deals with the South. Unsurprisingly, one of the first acts of the FBI, which was actually tentatively set up by the grand nephew of Napoleon in 1908, was to prosecute Jack Johnson, a black man, for a now banned law that was both sexist and racist. Parker is so steadfast in his attempts to white-wash this history that he creates a black FBI agent. But there were NO black persons in the FBI in 1964, unless they were doing janitorial or chauffeur work. No surprise then that the film omits one large fact: the FBI and Federal Government were warned in advance that killings in Mississippi would happen, and activists and law experts explained to the federal government weeks in advance that it was their constitutional obligation to send protection down to Mississippi prior to and during several planned civil rights protests. These demands went all the way to the White House, via Attorney General Robert Kennedy, but where ignored. While these demands for a few hundred marshals went out, 40,000 soldiers were being shipped to Vietnam. Twelve days later the three victims of this film disappear. End result: a film about racism which turns the historical racists into heroes.5/10 - Worth one viewing.",

            "content": "In a barber shop, one of the locals in Meridian, Mississippi, declares, \"Our nigras were happy till those beatnik college kids came down here stirrin' things up.\" This seemingly simple statement sums up much of the conflict of \"Mississippi Burning\": the clash between the ruling powers of white racial segregationists to maintain their status quo and leaders of the Civil Rights Movement bent on weakening and ultimately destroying Jim Crow laws in the south. Although the film at the outset comes off as rather \"black and white\", the white southern males portrayed as pure devils and the African-Americans as meek victims, the brutality and violence of what occurred during the Civil Rights Movements during the 1950's and 1960's is not exaggerated. The church-burnings and lynchings had been going on since the early 20th century and climaxed under Eisenhauer, Kennedy and Johnson. The happy ending was the signing of civil rights legislation by President Johnson, although many people paid a high price for this goal, some with their lives.\"Mississippi Burning\" is loosely based on the investigation of three civil rights workers who disappeared while attempting to cross the Nebraska-Mississippi border in June of 1964. (Their bodies were eventually found in a hay stack, and their car was retrieved from a swamp.) Their crime: attempting to register Black and ethnic voters in the state of Mississippi. Most of the events, save for aspects of the investigation, have been largely fictionalized. However, the events as portrayed do well to paint a landscape of distrust and violence stemming from racial hatred and intolerance that was still prevalent in the deep south at that time. Federal agents, played by Willem Dafoe and Gene Hackman in tour-de-four Oscar-caliber performances, enter into what appears to be a mini-civil war. Members of the KKK and other supremacist groups run the town and surrounding area like a demilitarized zone in which white males hold all political power and keep blacks in living conditions that would give Auschwitz a run for its money. Whenever a black or ethnic minority challenges this status quo, either they are lynched or their house is burned down. And they burn down a black church for good measure. (Of course the arsonists also regarded themselves as Christians, but that's a whole other subject.) Law enforcement turns a blind eye to these heinous acts since they are in cahoots with the segregationists.Much of the film chronicles the federal investigation which reveals that the disappearance of the young men is just a tip-of-the-iceberg of racially-motivated brutality and violence maintained by a complex infrastructure designed to keep blacks and other ethnic minorities \"in their place\". \"Happiness\" as defined by the quote at the beginning of this review basically means living in squalor and fear with no hope of improvement. Simultaneously, the black community refuses to speak to the investigators fearing anything they say will have dire consequences at the hands of either local law enforcement or the supremacist groups. The African-Americans are in a no-win situation. Swift violence is inflicted upon them if they protest, but it also occurs without provocation. The racists literally get away with murder largely because they can. The film implies that these white supremacists burned several churches and homes during the course of about 2 weeks in the rural town of Meridian, Mississippi, probably excessive even by KKK standards. However, I think the point was to compress much of the violent and brutal behavior against African-Americans and other ethnic groups that reached a fervent pitch from about 1955 to 1965 into a single cinematic experience. \"Mississippi Burning\" is an attempt to demonstrate the nature of the destructiveness of the forces fighting to maintain racial inequality that had persisted since the end of the American Civil War 100 years earlier with the maintenance of Jim Crow laws.\"Mississippi Burning\" is largely about how the southern white community feared the Civil Rights Movement--fear that manifested itself as crime and violence. You have to wonder what were they fearing? That a black man might find a cure for cancer, eradicate poverty, or, become President of the United States and enact a health-care bill? Fear is a very powerful force. Fear can be used to keep other people down but it can also be used to compel otherwise good people into the most heinous of acts through distorted rationalizations and fabrications. I don't believe all white southerners who fought against civil rights were pure evil. But I do think many of their minds were poisoned by fear and hatred. Maybe this film can help cure them.",

            "content": "The movie \"Mississippi Burning\" is the story of two FBI agents investigating the murder of three civil right workers in Mississippi in 1964. The tactics used by the perpetrators included hangings, burning barns, churches, livestock, and homes. The locals intimidated the blacks who they believed were cooperating with the FBI, instilling scare tactics to terrify them into avoiding the agents. The more the FBI tried to gain information, the more the violence escalated. The sheriff's office was involved in the terror and used it to maintain their power. They were bullies, believing their behavior was justified. They wouldn't tolerate opposition. Everyone involved was responsible, even the mayor, who one agent pointed out wasn't \"in on it\" yet Agent Ward reciprocated by saying his knowledge of the incident was enough to involve him. Agent Ward was baffled at the behavior of the locals, being a na\u00efve, straight-arrow D.C. agent while Agent Anderson was realistically unsurprised, having been raised in northern Mississippi.The mutation of the FBI tactics in the investigation was the most thought provoking part of the movie. Agents Ward and Anderson were on completely opposite ends of the spectrum. Ward was trying to be polite and accomplish goals by the book while Anderson was a street-smart, unorthodox, fearless, and empathetic agent. At first, they sought and expected cooperation from the sheriff; that never happened. Their questioning of the black community was met with resistance. Agent Anderson established a rapport with Deputy Pell's wife. He sensed her overwhelming desire to break away, yet she was at first reluctant to help, being a dutiful wife and southern woman, but eventually became an informant. Anderson had no qualms assaulting one of the members at their \"social club\", letting them know early on that he didn't take kindly to threats.There were two very pivotal points in the movie that made the FBI change its tactics, even to the point of Agent Ward growing a backbone and adopting some of Anderson's philosophies. First was organizing a \"secret meeting\" of the key members in a church. When they realized it was a set up and bailed, Lester ignorantly spilled and the FBI quickly took advantage of his vulnerability. As Agent Anderson put it, \"the rattlesnakes were beginning to commit suicide\". The story took a very dramatic turn when Deputy Pell's wife finally broke down and identified the location of the bodies. After the discovery and processing, the sheriff insisted Pell settle the \"problem at home\", even sending 3 fellow members to watch over Pell violently assault his wife for her betrayal. They had finally struck a vital nerve with the FBI and Anderson was finished relying on Ward's protocol. Ward's pressed-suit, pen-and-paper, rookie agents were out and Anderson's seasoned, no-nonsense \"fixer\" agents were in. I found an interesting correlation in the FBI measures to the perpetrator's. They spared no expense for a desired outcome, to include a rouse hanging of Lester, an extremely coercive interrogation of the mayor in a desolate shack, and, my favorite scene of the entire movie, Agent Anderson's retaliation against Deputy Pell at a barber shop, asking Pell if \"he struck a blow for the white man\" the night he killed the civil rights workers as well as the night he remorselessly beat his wife.I believe the FBIs tactics, although unorthodox, were justified. They tried to play it by the book and it didn't work. Perhaps they pushed the envelope to gain results but justice prevailed. Agents Ward and Anderson learned a thing or two about each other and the ethics of \"bureau procedure\".",

That same movie also sparked my desire to dig up some other terrific films about civil rights, and then it doesn't take too long before you end up at Alan Parker's \"Mississippi Burning\". Although nearly 30 years old now, this is still an immensely powerful and often shocking tale inspired by the real-life murders of 3 young activists by members of the Ku Klux Klan in a small Mississippian county in the spring of 1964. I'm European and there isn't too much known around here regarding the facts of this case, but I can easily imagine that turning this true crime case into a fairly large-scaled film production much have caused quite a bit of amok and controversy even 24 years later. Still, even though the references towards the so-called 'Mississippi civil right workers' murders' case are unmistakable, director Alan Parker primarily approaches the events from a more objective viewpoint by focusing on the FBI investigation. As the sudden disappearance of the 3 youngsters in rural Mississippi is considered alarming (perhaps because 2 of them are Caucasian\u0085), the FBI sends two agents over to the Magnolia State. Alan Ward is a young graduate and ambitious city agent who strictly follows the protocol, whereas Rupert Anderson is a former Mississippi small county sheriff himself and uses more unorthodox methods to find out the things he want. Needless to say their styles and personalities often clash, but it's Anderson who makes the most progress in the case, especially when he develops a tender \u2013 almost poetic, in fact \u2013 relationship with the wife of the sadist deputy (and KKK-member) Clinton Pell. Admittedly, you could blame director Alan Parker and scriptwriter Chris Gerolmo their excessive overuse of stereotypes\u0085 All the FBI folks (except for Anderson) are uptight desk clerks with fancy suits, all the black people are mute victims, the women are docile and petrified wives and all the racist rednecks are ignorant and violent scumbags. Of course, just because the stereotypes are such opposites, the confrontations between them are extremely intense and atmospheric. The suspense literally mounts when the rednecks are relentlessly chasing an innocent black guy, or when Agent Anderson nonchalantly walks into the unofficial KKK clubhouse. Another reason why I personally don't mind the use of stereotypes is because it gives the fantastic cast the opportunity to showcase their talents. Awesomely talented guys like Michael Rooker, Brad Dourif and Pruit Taylor Vince are truly brilliant in depicting their vile and loathsome Southern redneck characters. But the greatest performance undeniably comes from Gene Hackman, as he almost naturally shapeshifts between hard-boiled law enforcer and tenderly comprehensive gentleman during his sequences with Frances McDormand. Another umpteenth brilliant performance from one of the greatest actors of the 70s, 80s and 90s.",

The most graphic part of the film is at the beginning, when a car driving down a barren road is pulled over by a couple of police officers. Rather then write a ticket for speeding they taunt them and shoot them. We don't really know exactly what happened, we have some idea that these officers are a little more than just consciencous of fast drivers, and that's what hooks us in. Two officers, Gene Hackman and William Dafoe, are sent into investigate, and once we know what they're investigating, there's the irony of the audience now knowing what's going on but the characters don't. Hackman and Dafoe have an interesting chemistry, I won't say good, because they start off in such distant alignments from each other, that there's no real partnering/interaction at first. Dafoe is a by-the-book guy who's young and inexperienced and Hackman is a somewhat more playful guy who's from the area and tries to act like he's \"one of the guys\" when they interact with locals. There's an interesting power relationship between them, because despite Dafoe's inexperience and lack of street smarts, he's the senior officer on the case, but regardless of who really has more power between them, they don't really get anywhere  for a long time with this town. The drama is in a curious deadlock of the FBI officials saying, \"what happened to these missing people? where are the bodies?\" and the locals in the town saying, \"we don't know, we didn't do anything? why don't you just go back and forget about the case?\", and the two parties here start acting like my senile grandparents who ask the same question over and over thinking that they'll get a different response. This would get kind of boring, except for the changes happening within Hackman's character who starts to become more passionate about what's happening as he befriends the deputy's wife, Frances McDormand, and just gets more and more p***ed about stuff. Hackman really was at the heart of this movie and McDormand's character really added a lot to the movie, as a more innocent and foolishly youthful woman than the roles she normally gets. I wouldn't describe the film as jump-out-of-your-seat exciting, but the drama and quality is there underneath all the grittiness.",

What starts out as a routine missing persons investigation quickly escalates into something much more serious especially when Ward (who isn't from Mississippi) starts to learn more about its townsfolk and about how those in charge choose to 'run' their town.I suppose it was kind of inevitable that a film like Mississippi Burning is going to be met with a rather mixed reception particularly as it apparently plays very 'loose' with the facts. In all fairness though anyone who watches a film and expects it to be 100% faithful or true to the story is somewhat na\u00efve. What you get with Mississippi Burning is an interesting and fairly entertaining film which provides an insight into racial segregation in 1960's America - at least that's how I saw it!!!Although a lot of what we see may be fictional director Alan Parker works well with scriptwriter Chris Gerolmo in creating a powerful and somewhat terrifying look at the devastation that can be caused through bigotry and narrow-mindedness. Parker doesn't hold back and manages to stage some excellent scenes (the scene with Gene Hackman in the barber shop is particularly chilling as well as being memorable). The brutality continues throughout the film, which, admittedly, can make it hard to watch, but for me, this adds to the realism and Parker really engages with the viewer by drawing them into this appalling period of history.The strong performances compliment Parker's brutal direction well and the likes of Hackman and Dafoe are both good here (even though they are a rather clich\u00e9d pair of mismatched cops) Despite this though there's still an interesting and rather uneasy dynamic between the two men and the script occasionally affords them some amusing exchanges. The villains of the piece (Ermey, Dourif, Rooker, and Sartain) are excellent and all give rather sneering and cold-hearted performances.Aside from the cops and procedural elements being a tad clich\u00e9d one other aspect of this film that I found slightly problematic was the character of Mrs Pell (Frances McDormand). Her character is one of the few 'white' people who disagrees with segregation and is against how the Klu Klux Klan and the majority of white people treat the black people. This made her an interesting character who really should have had a more active role in the film. Instead of that, she is little more than window dressing and a bit on the side for Anderson (which is a tad frustrating and a waste of McDormand's acting talent). I personally felt that the film would have been slightly better if it had have at least given us some insight into what things were like on the other side of the fence.So yes there are some flaws with this film and rather ironically the narrative does suffer from being a bit 'black and white' However, it is a powerful drama that takes us back to an appalling time period, and although some of its brutality makes it hard to watch, I did find it to be a relatively engaging story.",

            "content": "With some certainty, Mississippi Burning was the best film of 1988. I watched it recently, as I do from time to time, and in reading other viewer comments, I was dismayed to read such unwarranted and unintelligent criticism of a film that has done so much to expose the realities of the Black experience in the Deep South during the 1960's. On more than one occasion, a viewer (usually anonymous) has pinpointed the film as racist, in that it offers a view of the Civil Rights movement involving whites and government agents as key instigators of change. They feel that it portrays blacks in a negative light, downplaying the roles blacks played in the acquisition of their own equality. These people are either unaware, or just plain ignorant. There is a reason that this film focuses on the efforts of White FBI agents to locate the three missing boys. To begin with, this film focuses on a true story (slightly fictionalized for cinematic effect). During Freedom Summer of 1964, many white college students and black students as well worked under the guidance of groups like the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee, in an effort to set up voter registration drives for blacks that had been historically disenfranchised. The three missing boys (two white, one black) received much attention during that summer from a Federal standpoint. This is a fact. Yet the reason for governmental interest in the murder of these boys exemplifies the attitudes of the era. Historically, murdered civil rights workers did not garner much attention. Yet because this case involved two northern whites, suddenly The FBI took interest. This is the reason for FBI involvement in the story. The fact that blacks are shown quite often as scared and unwilling to cause a stir in this film also is historically accurate. While there were many blacks that made great inroads and took huge risks to their personal well-being, the citizenry of blacks in this film is an accurate portrayal of the times. How many of us today would be willing to talk, inform, and be seen attempting to use our constitutional rights if we knew that such actions might get us killed? The seeming disinterest of blacks in this film is a result of years of Jim Crow legislation, of lynch law, and of outright terror tactics brought upon the black population by racist whites.It is a picture of a population that wants to stand up and scream, but is reluctant for very justifiable reasons. To stay alive often meant keeping your mouth shut. To make a film in which all black citizens of Philadelphia, Mississippi stood collectively against the perpetrators of these murders would be historically incongruent. Try to look past the overriding white involvement in this film and understand that this is the way the events unfurled. Perhaps it is a sad commentary on white involvement in Civil rights that was too little, too late. It took the death of two whites to spark interest in the events in Phil. Mississippi. This much is obvious. But as the search for these boys made headlines daily, just remember that many blacks were pulled from rivers that summer, in the search for the three civil rights workers. Unfortunately, these discoveries never made the headlines. A murdered white was cause for alarm. But a lynched black pulled from a swamp was merely accepted. Take this film as a lesson, and be glad that many things have changed since 1964.",

            "content": "Mississippi Burning (1988)Number 1 - 1988 Top 15 - 1980sTop 100 - All Time 1964. When America was at war with itself.Few other films are as powerful, meaningful and profoundly unsettling yet simultaneously intense and action packed as Alan Parker's Mississippi Burning. To say that this film is good would be an understatement. There are two ways this film can be seen - Firstly this is a first rate police thriller, superbly shot, it delivers maximum impact.Secondly, and most importantly in my opinion, this film is a sumptuous documentation of extreme racism in the Deep South in the 1960s. The Declaration of Independence states that \"All men are created equal\". This ain't true in Mississippi. This film is harrowing, it is not easy to watch and at times it is simply emotionally overwhelming. This is one piece of cinema which displays the mindless and infinite callousness and savagery that is possessed by humanity. What makes us so hateful? This film does not investigate such complex issues,it rather shows its devastating effects.The murder of 3 civil rights activists in Mississippi in 1964, attracts external police forces (mainly the FBI) to investigate the disappearance of these 3 young people (2 white, 1 black). Head of operation is Mr. Ward, played with a commanding and controlled brilliance by Willem Dafoe and accompanied by Gene Hackman. Now here is the thing with Hackman, he is one of the greatest screen actors of our time. His presence transcends beyond the screen, whenever he is on the screen he steals the show. Few other actors are as magnetic as Hackman, especially when we see him get angry.This is an excellent achievement, with an outstanding cast, including Frances McDormand in a superb performance.When you see this film, ask yourself one question. Where does all this hatred come from? Essential Viewing 10/10",

I saw this because Alan Parker made one of my favorite movies ever (Angel Heart - but Parker also made a lot of lesser films) and because Gene Hackman -one of the most natural and effortless actors of all time- plays in it (and I rarely see a movie for the actor). Hackman plays the lead with a very young Dafoe and both do an excellent job as well as the rest of the A-level cast (R Lee Ermey, Brad Dourif, Stephen Tobolowsky, Frances McDormand & Michael Rooker). I found the movie very entertaining and it never fails to keep your attention. It's not a classic for me personally but watching these fine actors work their craft makes this a product worthy of your time if you appreciate the fine art of cinema.",

            "content": "Films that deal with civil rights issues can be a touchy subject and Alan Parker's 1988 film about true events was a firestorm for controversy. The film's dark subject matter about violence towards the African-American community in 1963 Mississippi remains an important part of shaped the eventual progress to equality for all races. The film tells the tale of two federal agents (Gene Hackman as Rupert Anderson and Willem Dafoe as Alan Ward) sent to the Deep South to investigate the disappearance of three civil rights workers (two African- American men and one Caucasian man). What the men find is the roots of corruption run deep in the town as the local lawmen and KKK members attempt to scare Anderson and Ward off, but their reserve steels the agents against the hate they constantly endure.As the leads, Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are the voices of reason among the judgmental and horrible characters in the small town their characters are investigating. Hackman plays the loose cannon officer who will bend the rules to get results while Dafoe is the by-the-books and ethical man, but later converts to Hackman's tactics after tensions boil to a breaking point between Anderson and Ward. The actors' chemistry is palpable as they play off each other in tandem from verbal sparring to their eventual physical confrontation, but without losing a mutual respect for how the other handles the investigation.The narrative is loosely inspired by the actual disappearance and murders of three civil rights workers (as depicted in the film's opening scene). However the movie delves into fiction for the majority of its run-time which does hurt the accuracy of the story. The inaccuracies however do not take away from the gripping power of the story as the movie is more focused on the inherent racism in the South during the 1960s. The movie's subject matter lent to controversy about the violence depicted against the black community, but the film scored Oscar nominations despite the criticism (however star Gene Hackman grew wary about films with such violence which caused him to withdraw from participating in \"Silence of the Lambs\" after he had bought the rights).Do not miss this film, it'll open your mind on what it was like back in an era of civil unrest.",

Based loosely on truth, set in the 1960's, FBI agents Rupert Anderson (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Gene Hackman) and Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) are called to Mississippi to investigate the disappearance, obviously murder, of three civil rights workers, one being black, carried out by members of the Ku Klux Klan. The whole town is divided by the white and coloured, so racism is all around, and of course there are many whites who are secretly members of the KKK, helping bring brutality and to burn down black peoples' homes, crosses and churches. Of course this is set during the time of the civil rights movement, so all the people involved in these heinous crimes are caught and punished. Also starring Oscar nominated Frances McDormand as Mrs. Pell, Brad Dourif as Deputy Clinton Pell, Full Metal Jacket's R. Lee Ermey as Mayor Tilman, Gailard Sartain as Sheriff Ray Stuckey, Heroes' Stephen Tobolowsky as Clayton Townley, Michael Rooker as Frank Bailey, Pruitt Taylor Vince as Lester Cowans, Badja Djola as Agent Monk, Kevin Dunn as Agent Bird and Saw's Tobin Bell as Agent Stokes. The performances are fantastic, the story is very gripping, and with all the controversy and violence you really understand how terrible this time was. It won the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing, Best Sound and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Original Film Score for Trevor Jones, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay.

This is a totally different America from today with the ku klux klan terrorising neighbouring southern negros.This film, whilst often brutal, is a great depiction of this period, when crosses, churches and many negros' homes were burned.I have also come to believe that this film is based loosely on a true story, when the president of the USA dispatched a number of Federal Agents to search for 3 missing civil rights workers. This prompted one of the largest FBI manhunts in history.Gene Hackman is a former Southern Sheriff turned FBI, who teams up with a by-the-book agent Dafoe. Hackman is unorthodox by nature, and Dafoe continually wonders where the hatred comes from. \"Hatred is something that people are taught as soon as they are born\" - taught in schools basically, as the Deputys' wife says to Hackman.   Minor Spoiler:Soon, it is found that the sheriffs are part of the klan and are allegedly involved in the whole saga. Hackman's unorthodox methods are the ones that work, whilst Dafoe's methods do not. Hackman originally convinces Dafoe and they group with other agents to let fight back.

            "content": "One year after his misunderstood masterpiece, \"Angel Heart\", the English director Alan Parker returns to the South for filming \"Mississippi Burning\", a crime / thriller drama about 2 F.B.I. agents sent to Jessup County, Mississippi in 1964 to investigate the disappearance of 3 civil rights activists. Led by the younger agent, Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe), a yankee 'crusader' and a symbol of Kennedy's administration, who follow the Bureau's rules by the book & his older and savvy partner, Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman), a former Mississippi Sheriff, who knows the behavior, mentality, traditions & way of life of his fellow countrymen. When they suspect that the Ku Klux Klan may be operating there and responsible for the disappearance of the 3 activists with the support of the local law, Ward & Anderson start a war against the \"phantom' killers in searching for the truth, clashing with the town people that don't want them there... Superbly directed motion picture from an engaging screenplay penned by Chris Gerolmo, based on actual facts and visually stunning, shot by the cinematographer Peter Biziou, who won a well deserved Academy Award, \"Mississippi Burning\" is a gritty, realistic & sweaty movie experience, filmed on location near where the actual murders took place with even some scenes shot in a documentary style which enhanced the straight tone of the film. It moves at a thrilling pace, involving the viewer in the sordid ways of racism at his worst, stereotyping that (almost) all of the white southern characters are evil and preaches the audience about the innocent victims of the intolerance and the deserved punishment of their executioners, guided by the eyes of two different lawmen, the liberal moralist - Willem Dafoe and the conservative 'vigilante' , Gene Hackman. Hackman delivers maybe his best performance since his brilliant turn in Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Conversation\" ('74), he's determined, reckless & sarcastic, showy, but commanding the screen with gravitas proving why he's one of the best (still sadly, underrated) north American actors ever. Willem Dafoe, fresh from his Academy Award nomination for \"Platoon\", co-stars in a less prominent role, but equal effective, especially in his \"boy scout\" antagonism with the Hackman character. Frances McDormand, who scored a nomination for Best Supporting Actress, is the stand-out / revelation as the disgruntled & fragile wife of the local Deputy. She shines in a role that could have been underplayed if performed by a less capable actress. The supporting players are top notch (kudos to the casting department & Parker's skillful direction of actors) from the always remarkable as the hateful 'usual suspects\": Brad Dourif & Michael Rooker to R. Lee Ermey; Gailard Sartain; Badja Djola in an intense cameo appearance; Tobin Bell, making here his feature film debut, years before his breakthrough role in the \"Saw\" franchise and Stephen Tobolowsky, among others. In short, \"Mississippi Burning\" was one of the best films of 1988, nominated for 7 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director & Best Leading Actor for Hackman, winning 1 and perhaps only lost the Best Picture Oscar, due to the Academy's emotional vote in favor of Barry Levinson's sympathetic drama, \"Rain Man\". Highly recommended !!",

The best of the film is the acting of the whole group of actors and actresses led by Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe, the latter as a generous FBI detective instead of being a villain as usual. The film left no doubt that KKK is (or was) a terrorist organization with a complete lack of human feelings, only with the obsession to kill black people, to reduce its population and denigrate it any way.

I know, totally weird, right?I even loved how Hackman made his character Agent Rupert Anderson, a really humorous guy.

The tragic history behind Alan Parker's film makes an already dark tale into a deeply unsettling one. Parker has a great ability to evoke a sense of despair, having done so to great effect in the earlier films 'Midnight Express' and 'Angel Heart'. The credit isn't all Parker's, though: he had to have people convey his vision; the people he chose did so very effectively. The two leading actors, Willem Defoe and Gene Hackman, both have a knack for playing villains and menacing characters, and have played the antagonist in a superhero film. But that's pretty much where the similarities end for me. They come from different generations and play their best roles very differently, but if you first saw them in 'Mississippi Burning', you'd be forgiven for thinking that they were a long-standing film duo, like Lemmon and Matthau. Hackman and Defoe are accompanied by a range of highly talented actors, including Oscar winner Frances McDormand, the always enjoyable R. Lee Ermey, and two of the men we'd later find stirring trouble in 'The Walking Dead' \u2013 Pruitt Taylor Vince and Michael Rooker. Everyone involved in 'Mississippi Burning' plays their strengths effectively, ensuring that Alan Parker's dark historical drama isn't a film you're likely to forget.",

            "content": "Alan Parker's Mississippi Burning is a surprisingly good police thriller that mixes the intrigue and mystery of a police investigation with a commentary on American culture in the 1960's, and said people's attitudes towards racism. It's rare for a film to combine these elements properly, and many have failed at it, but through it's efficient pace and competent piecing together, Mississippi Burning achieves it's aim admirably. Mississippi Burning is a very professionally handled film and credit for that has to go to the director, who has a habit of putting together very professionally made films. The influence that this film has had on later crime investigation films such as the magnificent 'LA Confidential' is evident throughout, and that adds yet more credibility to the proceedings. In spite of it's turbulent plot, Alan Parker never sets out directly to shock the audience, and despite several scenes of violence, it's always the film's plot that takes centre stage and Alan Parker doesn't stray from that as many other directors have done. This film doesn't need to shock and offend to get it's message across.The plot follows the disappearance of three men - two of them white Jews and the other a young black man. We then follow the fortunes of two FBI men that come into town to investigate the disappearance. The acting in the movie is strong throughout, with William Dafoe and Gene Hackman heading a strong cast. The two stars do a great job of drawing the audience into the movie, and the two shine throughout. They are joined by a host of lesser-known stars, such as Frances McDormand, Brad Dourif, Stephen Tobolowsky and a great little turn from Michael Rooker as a racist KKK member. The themes that are implemented into the plot are impressively portrayed, with the social study being the most prominent of them. Mississippi Burning adequately denounces hatred, and does a great job of getting across the stupidity and pointlessness of it. The film is also notable for a great atmosphere throughout, which is matched by a great soundtrack that creates a very foreboding and tension filled feeling. My only real criticism of the movie is due to it's ending, which goes on a bit and kills the atmosphere that the film has done such a good job of creating. Still, this is a very good movie and one I don't hesitate to recommend!",

The parts of the film which showed violence towards the negroes were well acted and realistic, the \"interrogation\" of one of the white actors was superb.The ending was abrupt, almost disappointing, the film seemed to lead to a climax which surely should have been deeply emotional and active but it seemed the director had given up and couldn't be bothered.

But this film should make you angry for one reason and one reason only, that the FBI, the most volatile opponent of Civil Rights Workers, actually turn out the good guys. Mississippi Burning started the disturbing mini- genre of mainstream films exploring the atrocities of racism through the eyes of people who were the least offset by it., the white male. To cite prime examples of this genre where the plight of the African -American is used as a tool for the White character's growth or change. The Green Mile, The Legend of Bagger Vance, Places in the Heart, And most heinously, Ghosts of Mississippi,(where a great opportunity to tell the story of the amazing leader Medgar Evers is wasted to tell the story of the White lawyer who brought his murderer to justice. Is that why he died? Is that why he did all that work to free his people from oppression? Is that why he sacrificed his life to make sure that the white lawyer get's his props in a Hollywood movie?) are part of this legacy of having Black character's be the catalyst for the growth of the white people they come into contact. As if they don't bleed blood, but magical pixie-dust to enlighten the white masses.It's this UN-focused liberalism that taints Mississsippi Burning. The argument of the writer's taking creative license with the historical facts to make a more compelling mystery is pointed, but the callousness of the Producer's hyping it as a socially- responsible, \"important \" film is just flat-out ridiculous. The film works as well as it can as a hard-boiled mystery, and is masterfully acted by Hackman, MacDormand, and Defoe, but Alan Parker is not known for his subtlety, and the villains of the piece are just so inherently evil, rather than being portrayed as just the sad, scary,ignorant, tragic hicks they were.",

            "content": "When mentally compiling a list of greatest actors of all time (Stewart, Hanks, Cruise, Hopkins, etc.), Gene Hackman isn't one who often immediately springs to mind. Yet, I cannot recall ever see him give a truly bad performance. That streak continues with \"Mississippi Burning\", a film in which his character interactions go a long way towards keeping the overall experience relevant.For a very basic overview, \"Mississippi Burning\" tells the story of a 1960s Mississippi town that is being torn apart by racial tensions after three young civil rights activists go missing. FBI agents Anderson (Hackman) and Ward (Willem Dafoe) are sent to investigate the case, each bringing a different personality and style to the proceedings.By more modern (30+ years after its release) standards, this is a movie that can come off a bit \"over the top\". Nearly all the town residents are backwoods country hicks and no person of color is really given any agency within the story (only looked at as objects of pity). While the overall themes are as relevant today (if not more so) than they were at release date, the execution seems dated.Fortunately, the acting very much carries the load in \"Mississippi Burning\". This is especially true with Hackman, who brings an electricity with him to every piece of film he occupies. The chemistry he builds with Dafoe is also solid, as the two butt heads (but ultimately learn from each other) in trying to work together to prevent a major conflict. Also turning in solid character performances are Frances McDormand and Brad Dourif.Overall, I enjoyed \"Mississippi Burning\", if not to any \"best of\" capacities. While lacking the nuance that such issues are normally given now, it largely makes up for it in earnestness and just overall acting talent. Another example of an acting gem in Hackman's underrated career.",

            "review_title": "Another Human Story by Alan Parker!",
            "content": "Mississippi Burning is one of the best American films of 1988. It is a harrowing police drama inspired by the Ku Klux Klan murders of three civil right activists: James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner. Alan Parker, as you might recall in his excellent 1978 drama Midnight Express, is fantastic at telling stories about the human condition as influenced by big bullies. Of course, the racist Southern Klan members are the big bullies here. In 1988, there was big controversy surrounding the film as people accused the film of being one of those \"white savior\" films. I get the justifications, but this is no documentary. This is a work of fiction that takes liberties with the truth to create a movie that not only entertains, but also scares you and make you laugh. Still, Parker does give his audience an idea what living in rural 1964 Mississippi can be like. And as for everything going on in the world today, this film holds a sense of relevance.Parker's magna opus, as some people have described the film, was a huge awards player come Oscar time. In addition to the amazing performances, I will never forget the striking images thanks to Peter Biziou's camera direction. The searing, flaming crosses, how the audience views the murder of the three men, etc. Are images that will be implanted in your brain. The 1960's is an altering year for the United States because of the Civil Rights Movement. Biziou's cinematography reflects the changing attitude and the resistance to this change. Between the cinematography, the thoughtful and well-researched screenplay from Chris Gerolmo, and the competent direction from Parker, this is a must-see film about an important time in our history.The movie came to be in 1985 when Gerolmo got his hands on a book about the FBI's investigation into the actual case. He wrote a draft of the script and later sold it to Orion. There were some interesting initial director choices such as Milos Forman and John Schlesinger, but Parker was the one who landed the role. As someone who knows all about the human spirit in extreme situations, he was a good choice to helm the project. Lots of research was put forth into the role. In the 2000's, we learn who the real Mr. X (the case's whistleblower if you will) was. But Gerolmo used Hollywood creativity to come up with who he thought Mr. X was, which allowed him to use Frances McDormand's character as film's moral character.It is 1964. Three Civil Right Activists from the North have disappeared after trying to help change voter laws. The FBI is sent to investigate. Agent Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) does everything by the book. His partner, Agent Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) does not. Anderson is a former sheriff, and he understands the way of living down here. They keep their focus on Deputy Pell (Brad Dourif) and his wife (Frances McDormand). As the investigation continues, the local KKK outfit attack the African-American community. With no one on any side talking, Anderson is allowed to proceed with the investigation in any matter he sees fit.Great performances are abound here. Dafoe shows his range very easily as one movie he plays Jesus Christ and the next movie he plays a completely different role to great results. Even better were Gene Hackman (a legend) and Frances McDormand (the film's moral center). These two have fantastic chemistry with one another. Hackman's performance is more subtle, but you realize that he is growing fond of her and wants to take her away from the big, bad man that is her husband. In terms of the bad guys, Michael Rooker and Brad Dourif have made careers playing these types. Very effective!Overall, Mississippi Burning is a movie that should be seen. It is one of my favorite films of 1988 as it tells an incredibly important, relevant story. I would ignore these \"white-washing\" comments because it is a story of fiction. I would be very concerned otherwise. The intense, dramatic moments and images have been seared in my brain and they will be hard to forget. I became emotionally invested into the movie, and I am sure you will too. If you like Alan Parker's previous movies like Midnight Express or Angel Heart, you are going to like this one.My Grade: A.",

            "content": "This film essentially begins on a dark night in Mississippi with three civil rights workers traveling on a rural road when they notice that they are being followed by several cars driving much too closely behind them. After being rear ended a number of times by one of the cars, a high-speed chase ensues but ends when the civil rights workers take a dirt road and are forced to stop. It's then that a police officer steps up to the car and kills all three while several other men look on approvingly. The scene then shifts to two FBI agents, \"Rupert Anderson\" (Gene Hackman) and \"Alan Ward\" (Willem Dafoe) traveling down to Mississippi to investigate the disappearance of these three men. Within no time they become aware of the fact that there is widespread support for the violence by the white community there and that the local police department is at the center of it all. What they don't realize, however, is just how difficult their investigation will become due to the hatred and racism that has festered so long in this part of the country. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this turned out to be a pretty good film due in large part to the excellent performances of both Gene Hackman and Frances McDormand (as \"Mrs. Pell\"). It does, however, suffer from the fact that a number of scenes were embellished beyond historical accuracy. But that's Hollywood for you. It should also be noted that several prominent voices within the Black community have also voiced their disagreement with the way this film portrayed certain events as well. Be that as it may, from a strictly non-historical perspective, I found this movie to be quite riveting and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",

Up until this point I could be describing both actual events and the plot of Mississippi Burning but that is really about all of the similarities that there are between the two. Mississippi Burning is a great movie all in itself. The acting is superb from the two lead actors, especially on Willem Dafoe's part. (Though Gene Hackman was the one nominated for an Oscar) The movie tells a powerful story about racism and hatred in the south during the sixties. The story is engaging and the characters are convincing. However this movie cannot be considered in any way to be historically accurate. Many things were thrown into the story to make it a better movie despite their lacking in accuracy. For example the two FBI agents are portrayed as one being a by the book agent and the other being a down and dirty street smart kind of guy. An excellent selling point for a buddy cop formula but unrealistic. There is also an added character that never existed but was a black character that helped the FBI in the interrogations so that the heroes of this anti-racist movie would not all be white. This is not to say that Mississippi is anything short of excellent. But watch it for it's entertainment value, not it's historical accuracy.",

But as a movie, it falls short of it's potential by lapsing into the preachy and stereotypical Hollywood style which has become so commonplace in today's cinema. I doubt there are many souls left today who would deny that the KKK did some horrific things, or that there wasn't a pervasive racist culture in the South in the early 60's. But if there are, this movie tries to dispel all remaining skeptics with the subtlety of a lead balloon. By trying to tie up hatred and bigotry into one neat little package (by compartmentalizing and homogenizing groups of people), the movie fails in a rather big way. I mean, how many times have we been fed the message that all southerners are ignorant racists, that all blacks are innocent bystanders barely capable of controlling their own destinies, or that liberal educated whites are the saviors of the human race. Hardly original (or truthful).Beyond the problem of the \"message\", the movie has other faults. William Dafoe just isn't, in my opinion, believable at all. From his overly done \"Kennedy-esque\" appearance to his constant idealistic waning (the obvious target being the \"uneducated audience\"), his authenticity never rings true. And did dozens upon dozens of FBI agents really wade into the Mississippi swamps without regard for their expensive suits? Well, if they did, perhaps it just shows that educated Northern white boys aren't that smart after all! Finally, if director Alan Parker's intent was to leave us in the lurch regarding Anderson's and Mrs. Pell's \"relationship\", he succeeded with flying colors.On a positive note, Gene Hackman's performance is excellent. He holds it all together....well, he IS the movie. His delivery, mannerisms and character make Mississippi Burning quite enjoyable to watch from a cinematic point of view. Also top notch was Brad Dourif as Deputy Pell. Their performances almost make up for a mediocre and all-too-often condescending film",

Gene Hackman in one of his better roles and Willem  Dafoe doubly so try to uncover the mystery behind a murder of three activists and as they go along they realize that a big part of the town shares its views with the KKK, especially the people in high places.

The way that town treated their black community is horrific. This is an outstanding film, and should be watched. I think that if you enjoy realistic movies, and can stomach some very disturbing parts, than watch this, because this is the best movie of its kind I have ever seen.

            "content": "It's set in 1964 Mississippi, and the story is inspired by the murders of the three Civil Rights workers--James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner.The movie opens with us seeing the murder of the three men, but we don't see the disposal of the bodies. The FBI sends two agents to help in the search. \"Mississippi Burning\" has four primary characters. Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) is a good-old-boy FBI agent who was formally sheriff in a Mississippi town. He knows the culture. His boss is Agent Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe), who is younger, follows the rules completely, and is identifiable as an agent the minute he steps out of the car. The locals include a racist deputy, Clinton Pell (Brad Dourif), and his local beautician wife, Mrs. Pell (Frances McDormand). We also meet the mayor, the sheriff, a local businessman who heads the KKK, etc.Ward and Anderson have great difficulty getting anyone to talk to them amidst a spate of church and house burnings and the beating and lynching of African Americans who are willing to protest. Finally, after information provided by Mrs. Pell allows the bodies to be found> An FBI enhanced interrogator enables convictions to be obtained for civil rights violations.This movie has not aged well. On many levels, it's a \"white savior\" movie in which most African Americans are passive or helpless. Willem Defoe's character is supposed to have had experience with James Meredith earlier but consistently comes across as blind to culture and nuance. There are too many crazy scenes of FBI agents in suits and ties wading through swamps and pigpens. And Hackman's character deliberately puts Mrs. Pell in harm's way in a manner that makes no sense. Too many stereotypes are simply checked off. The conclusion is ridiculous, as convictions appear to be achieved within weeks.",

Rollins. The inter- action between those two characters and the realistic way they are dealt with ,makes it a real pleasure to watch. Its episodes describe  very plausible situations which occurred not long after the events shown in Mississippi Burning , and this country must be proud of the great changes which have taken place in such a short period of time.We are living in a historic transitional period when social changes are happening very fast, and at a speed that nobody thought could be possible.",

Maybe this woulda cut it back in 1963 with \"Mockingbird\" being about Atticus more than Tom Robinson.

Its power, not just in how the FBI eventually gets its men, but also how any human beings can treat another group the way they did, still has a place in 2004. It is a sad commentary on western society that even during the 'swinging sixties' this kind of behaviour was tolerated.The courage of Mrs. Pell, the sheer bloody-mindedness of Anderson to achieve a conviction, and the weary acceptance of Ward that to achieve conviction some corners had to be cut, is still as pertinent today as it was when the film was set. Hackman's performance was, as always, brilliant and Dafoe is a much underrated actor.Undoubtedly one of my favourite films, not just for the acting and the thought-provoking storyline, but also because whenever we watch it, it teaches us something important.",

            "review_title": "Imperfect but nonetheless powerful and even essential viewing",
            "content": "Mississippi Burning has cultivated a well-deserved reputation as a powerful but nonetheless imperfect film. It is powerful not only because of the emotionally charged topic (civil rights and racism) but also due to some effective acting, strong characterisations and also a shudder of drama and tension throughout. However, it is imperfect because it is slightly overlong, somewhat historically inaccurate (the FBI's role in promoting civil rights was far more ambiguous than portrayed here) and even clich\u00e9d at times. Luckily, the film does neither abuses those clich\u00e9s nor plays them entirely straight, allowing the film to retain its impact after many years. The film's power and tension is conveyed even during the very first scenes. The car chase is unnerving and the murders themselves are even moreso, with the merest splatter of blood hinting at the violence which occurred. Not a single moment is wasted on unnecessary blood and gore, which would otherwise have been unfitting for a historical drama like Mississippi Burning. Tension in the film is built even more effectively by intertwining the more sedate scenes with conflict and even outright violence. For example, Agent Anderson's quiet dialogues with the deputy sheriff's wife are punctuated by churches blowing up and arguments between Agent Anderson and Agent Ward. Speaking of Agent Anderson and Agent Ward, their characterisations are quite strong, in that the film provides a substantial backstory explaining their involvement and motivations (particularly Anderson) but also somewhat clich\u00e9d. This is because they both represent the perennial conflict between the renegade hero (Anderson) and the by- the-book, obstructive police chief (Ward). These roles are subverted though because Anderson sometimes does call Ward out for not properly following procedure, while unlike most police chiefs Ward knows exactly who the enemy is and does not resort to dramatics as readily as your average police chief type. The characterisations of the supporting cast are predictably less substantial. Much insight is provided into the wife's reasons for sticking with an obviously unpleasant husband, but the villains are broadly painted as hateful racists. The reason is likely to make it easier for the audience to oppose them and on that level such broad, simplistic characterisations work well. In addition, such characterisations do not necessarily prevent the actors from providing good performances. Brad Dourif does well representing your average bully; able to beat up on weaker people but impotent against a powerful adversary. Michael Rooker is even better; his Frank Bailey is comfortably the nastiest, most menacing character in the film, with none of the blustering of Stephen Tobolowsky's character. Tobolowsky's character is suitably provincial but was he really meant to be that blustering? R. Lee Ermey, Gailard Sartain and Pruitt Taylor Vince basically play good ol' Southern boys, with Ermey infusing a little Sergeant Hartman into his performance when he argues with Ward.On the other side of the coin, Willem Dafoe is cool, clinical and professional, while Frances McDormand plays the beleaguered housewife very well. However, it is really Gene Hackman who steals the show. Jocular one moment to physically violent the next, every scene with him is essential viewing because he raises the tension and drama. Badja Djola also warrants a mention, for his character veritably oozes hatred and menace. The dialogue is suitably provincial, with some rather zany lines (\"cornhole ******?\"). The plot plays much like a standard cop drama, with police being required to solve a mystery. Luckily, such a premise is exploited for maximum value, not only because of the tension and drama, but also because of the high stakes (freedom for a hitherto oppressed people). Ultimately, Mississippi Burning has its clich\u00e9s and historical distortions, but ultimately the acting, characterisations, drama and tension make for a potent film and essential viewing. 4.5/5 stars",

Lee Ermey, Michael Rooker, Stephen Tobolowsky, Kevin Dunn, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Badja Djola, Park Overall. (R)Searing, racially-charged drama loosely based on fact, with a pair of FBI agents--a former southern sheriff (Hackman) and a square-jawed Justice Department transfer (Dafoe)--traveling into Mississippi to investigate the disappearance of three civil rights workers in 1964. Manipulative and heavy-handed at times, to be sure, and pretty poor as a history lesson, but the filmmakers clearly intended this to be a gripping thriller, not a docudrama; choosing a real life case and tilting the perspective may not have been the wisest choice, but the film does exactly what it sets out to do, and delivers a dramatic powerhouse in terms of incendiary entertainment. Terrific performances (especially from Hackman, McDormand and Dourif) and Parker's forceful but composed direction make up for weaknesses in the script; vivid, Oscar-winning photography from Peter Biziou. A more true-to-life TV-movie, \"Murder in Mississippi,\" was produced a couple years later depicting the events leading up to the murder of the civil rights workers.81/100",

A travesty of justice but not a surprise.Once again (as with Forrest Gump), schmaltz wins the day. And yet as a piece of movie making, Mississippi Burning is one of the best I've seen for many years.The shocking and brutal way the movie unravels the story of racist bigotry in the Deep South during the Sixties is at times incredibly difficult to watch. Yet watch you will, due in part to a magnificent acting performance from Gene Hackman, backed up by a career best performance from Wilem DeFoe.Hackman & Defoe basically want the same thing - justice for some activists who have gone missing and who they suspect have been murdered. The only problem being that their methods are poles apart - Defoe does everything by the book whilst Hackman does the opposite using intimidation to divide the tight lipped community.The film is both moving and educational (and brave!) It is based on a true story and I don't really care how true the film is to this story or indeed how there may be certain historical inaccuracies or flaws. As a single coherent piece of cinema the film delivers in abundance. Even the ending whilst positive, is not euphoric and again highlights the bigotry and corruption around at the time. Many of these protagonists are spared jail but you at least get the feeling that it's 'a start'.This is not a 'feel good' film and was never meant to be. But the acting and imagery of this piece lasted longer in my memory than Rainman which whilst good, is too sentimental and gushing at times.Conclusion? Gritty, tension laden films win over schmaltz every single time.",

I first watched it in my 8th grade history class which is almost 10 years ago now. The thing that struck me the most was how no one person was actually \"evil\" but when a group of people get together it's a different story.The atmosphere is genius, the layout of the town looks vivid and alive. Unlike some movies with only two or three dedicated sets this one literally is the town. The people of the town seem pitch perfect for their roles, from the F.B.I. agents to the town Sheriff to everyone else. While I'm on the topic of characters I want to say how much I appreciated the fact that they, in one way or another, developed most of the people you meet by showing where they work, live, and give them personality.Now to discuss a little bit of the tone of the film. First off I never completely understood racism. The hatred of a group of people for any reason never made sense to me. As I said in the start of this review when something is taught to you, you don't think to question it. The only conclusion I can come to is that it's relying on blind hatred of some offense you think happened or were told happened. If that little bit didn't make sense racism doesn't make sense to me.The little things that are present here is what makes it a great film especially since none of the character development is done for the sake of the plot but for the sake of the character.Both Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are great actors and are amazing in there roles but between the two Hackman has a more subtle way about the way he investigates a case unlike Dafoe who always thinks more agents and equipment is better then Hackman's method of talking pleasantly to people to get the truth without the town turning on him.I could go on and on about this movie and the more I want to write the more I know the longer this is the less it'll be read. So I'll leave you with this, there are very few movies that leave you with a lasting impression and this is one that'll I'll be watching again and again.",

This movie displays a very negative image of the Ku Klux Clan (KKK) and it shows the brutality of their actions in the 1950's and 60's. In the beginning the movie demonstrated how the mindset was in the state of Mississippi. The movie introduces this mindset through FBI agent Anderson. Anderson has no respect for the black people in the south and believes that the state has just concerns in the segregation of Negroes. Anderson's boss Allen Ward disagrees with his philosophy and he sees everyone equal. The two Agents are sent to Mississippi to uncover what happened to three boys earlier in the month, two of the boys where white and one was black, which made the case very interesting. Agent Anderson saw the case as a simple \"missing persons\" case where as Allen Ward sees it as a full-investigation and a big case. At first in the movie the Depute and the County Sheriff see the two FBI agents as idiots and showed them no respect. All they told the agents is that they where released from the police department at nine o'clock and they did not hear from them since.",

Edgar Hoover was a devout racist homophobe...ah hell he was a complete bigot. He was extremely reluctant to send agents down south to investigate 3 people he couldn't have cared less about. It was only under intense pressure that he finally caved. Furthermore, the agents are depicted in this as heroic & defenders of the peace & justice as if they were Jedi's or something. Southerners were not & still are not easily intimidated by outsiders. It is true that they respect authority, perhaps a little too much, but that's local & state authority not federal. It was actually the other way around. And if you don't believe that, then remember this, Southerners ran out the mafia during prohibition with their ultimate ways of dispatching one creatively. Southerners take great pride in running out Capone & his ilk by using such measures as sticking a guy to a post & stuffing his testicles in his mouth that were bitten off by a calf. Hence the reason the mafia shifted to Canada for their bootlegging.In spite of all that, I know how Hollywood likes to distort things for the purposes of entertainment & emotional interests. (i.e. KKK in \"A Time To Kill,\" \"Top Gun,\" etc.) So, taking that into consideration, this film was awesome! Willem Dafoe is pretty good but the highlight is Gene Hackman as he delivers yet again in a role reminiscent of his \"Popeye Doyle\" role! Even though it was pure hogwash, there are vital facts still in the story & to watch Hackman go to work on the guy from \"Cuckoo's Nest\" is classic & probably the inspiration for Russell Crowe's character in \"L.A.

How could the combo of Parker, Gene Hackman, Frances McDormand etc fail so badly? I had to keep reminding myself- \"this is the man who made 'Midnight Express'\". It was easy to forget in the bad writing, the ham-handed smashing-together of facts, the cartoonish depictions. Something like this should never be fictionalized, because it could easily be written off as sensationalism. But o, how real it was. ANd how poorly it was rendered in a master's hands. Everyone's performances were not up to par, though Gene Hackman pretty much owns it as usual. Willem Dafoe was strangely incompetent. Frances McDormand's bad accent (as a southerner I really take umbrage at poor southern accents) left much to be desired. Everyone was drawn in (forgive the pun) black and white, and it just all felt so sophomoric. I feel like the heavy subject matter blinds people to its poor craftsmanship. I would like to see these events depicted again, but properly, and with all the facts. Because the truth was far uglier than this fictionalized brew could impart.",

I'm not particularly a fan of his; in fact, I'm hard-pressed to remember any other role he's played. Sure, Gene Hackman was great, but you pretty much expect that from him, and Frances McDormand deserved her Oscar Nomination; but Sartain really stood out as the sheriff. He managed to be compelling and charismatic and scary as hell all at the same time. Actually, so did Gene Hackman, which I think was intentional--the filmmakers wanted us to notice the very thin line between Hackman's ex-sheriff character and Sartain's Sheriff Stuckey.I thought the movie was a little heavy-handed, and its obvious attempts to be powerful and moving made me wince at times. But maybe that was necessary to portray just how dangerous and vicious racism can be when it ingrains itself into a culture. Overall, I would highly recommend this film.",

            "content": "This movie deals with the question if it is okay to use non-ethical methods of working by cops to fight outrageous injustice. Its setting is an American village in which the black population is systematically being abused by white supremacists. A young FBI-agent from New York ( Willem Dafoe ) and his cynical partner ( Gene Hackman ) discover that the racism is broad amongst the population and that even authority figures are involved in it. Every time they find a way to deal with the problem, they stumble upon fear, and therefore unwillingness to cooperate , from the blacks. At a certain point the agents find themselves using pure intimidation and violence to fight back against the injustice.I like it how the relationship between Dafoe and Hackman is slowly evolving throughout the story. At first there is some unwillingness to work together, but slowly they start to accept each other and their different methods of working. ''Good cop'' Dafoe is the honest one never straying from the law; Hackman is the bad cop who will use intimidation to get to the core of things. Both characters aren't necessarily heroes. They are flawed, emotional beings that stand seemingly powerless against something that is so much bigger than they realize at first. At a certain point both their methods of working mingle together in the sake of solving things.It's also nice that Hackman's character becomes involved with the case when he's experiencing the brutality of the situation; from a clearly apathetic person he turns into someone who is bend on fighting the injustice.I find this one of the best movies made about the recent '' Apartheid '' in American history. It is realistic, gritty and has no false sentimentality in it. It tells a brutal tale without creating heroes and villains.",

Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe do make a formidable lead cast. A special mention of Gene Hackman, who steals every scene with chilling perfection and agility. Willem Dafoe does well for a procedure following agent, who inevitably learnt that Justice isn't always through procedures. Frances McDormand is intense in her tough yet small role. Rest like Brad Dourif, Stephen Tobolowsky does very well. A special mention for then-unknown Tobin Bell who has a small role.\"Mississippi Burning\" strength lies in its accurate and natural portrayal of racism in 1960s era in most of America, Mississippi in the movie. The characters in this film don't know why they hate the way they do, they just know that they do. The sincerity with which Director Alan Parker depicts the events is amazing, with appropriate mix of gore, violence and torture. But having said that, this movie deals with a very sensitive issue and it largely enclose itself in the racism context.Overall, \"Mississippi Burning\" achieves what it sets out for. It was never about sending a message for equality or peace amongst races. It showcases the difficult times of 1960s and how a few good men delivers justice, unbeknownst of consequences.My Verdict: 8/10",

These three workers were jailed by the Deputy Sheriff on a speeding ticket. After they were released, they were on their way South out of town. Later they were followed by the Deputy Sheriff along with Ku Klux Klan members. On a country road they were pulled over shot and killed. The blue station wagon was burn't. The three were found buried in a Dam yard. This was world attention, in the news. It was all about hate not just against blacks, but also a Jew. Personally I hate the Confederate Flag. It's a symbol of hate, white supremacy and of course the KU Klux Klan. I like only the American Flag and the Christain Flag. There was no excuse for the murder of these three men. They came to investigate a church fire. No matter whether it's a white church or a black church, burning down the Lord's house is wrong. I likewise didn't like Gene Hackman's brutal tactics in this movie. Where he took the razor, from the Barber gave the Deputy Sheriff a shave, cutting his face, then dunking his head in a sink full of water. That's not how law enforcement officers should act.

Masterful direction by Parker, with extraordinary Oscar winning cinematography by Peter Biziou, and a haunting score by Trevor Jones. Sensational supporting performances by Frances McDormand, Brad Dourif, R. Lee Ermey, Gailard Sartain, Stephen Tobolowsky, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Badja Djoia, Frankie Faison, and Kevin Dunn.

These two characters are played by the fabulous actors Gene Hackman (Anderson) and Willem Dafoe (Ward). They are the Hoover-Boys. Anderson is the older one and has rougher methods to solve a/this case and a long time ago he was a sheriff in Mississippi. Ward is the younger agent and he has the responsibility for this whole case, because it is his one. He only takes decisions which are in agreement with (the) law and the rules. The two have to find out who is the murderer of two whites and one black man. First they try this with Ward's methods. He demands a lot of agents. Ward looks for proof, asking questions and always obeying the law. When Ward realizes that his methods fail he needs Anderson's help. He tries to solve this case with rather unconventional methods. It works! After some time they catch the members of the Ku Klux Klan.MISSISSIPPI BURNING is a good film. Maybe not the newest one but good. It is a True Story resp. is based on a true story. Therefore it is a documentation too. It is an interesting film because after watching it you know (a bit) more about the Klu Klux Klan, differences between black and white at this time and so on.

Had I known more about it, I'm sure I would have enjoyed the movie more. Currently, there several YouTube videos available for anyone who's interested in learning more about the background of the film, and you can read transcripts of the trials on the internet, even the confession of the informer. While the movie may not be perfectly aligned with how events actually played out, it does provide an vivid portrait of what it was like to live in Mississippi at that time: the absolute hegemony of white people over black people, perpetuated by violence and terror, along with social and economic inequality, not to mention the policies of segregation. It's certainly an important movie for us to see so that we can really understand how difficult the civil rights movement was for those that wanted to bring about change, and it can even help us to see how remnants of that period persist to this day. All this being said, I wish Mississippi Burning had been a better movie. Very little attention is given to how the KKK planned and executed these murders. And even though the focus of the story in the film was between the two FBI investigators, we are given only scant information how they were able to uncover the evidence that led to the trial, nor were we able to see the long term efforts of the government to convict these thugs, which led to sentences of only six years for only five or six of them. In other words, there's a lot more to the real life story than the film portrays, and given the rich amount of information that we now have, perhaps this could be better served as a Netflix mini series.",

            "content": "Contains Spoilers Mississippi Burning is a riveting dramatization of the real-life investigation into the disappearance of three 1960's civil rights workers in rural Mississippi.Despite being criticized by many for sticking pretty close to fact. Movie-a- Day.com blasts it for telling the story from a white perspective instead of a black perspective.  I feel that the accuracy of the dramatization is of the utmost importance; \"perspective\" is irrelevant.  Despite that, Mississippi Burning remains one of the most poignant, yet underrated films dealing with racism and justice in 1960's southern America, certainly on par with 1967's In the Heat of the Night.The northern-born, by-the-book FBI agent Ward (Willem Dafoe) is partnered with Agent Anderson (Gene Hackman,) a former small town Alabama sheriff to find them, but meet with resistance from Mayor Tilman (R. Lee Ermey) and Sheriff Ray Stuckey (Gailard Sartain) and an unsympathetic cast of police officers and townspeople, many of whose members are also members of the Ku Klux Klan.You can cut the tension between Anderson and Ward with a knife, but when his methods of getting to the truth fail, Ward is forced to cede to the older, wiser Anderson.  Through fostering a genuinely friendly relationship with the wife of a vicious Deputy Clinton Pell (played very convincingly by Frances McDormand and Brad Dourif respectively,) Anderson is able to learn that the civil rights workers were killed and buried in a nearby quarry.  When Mrs. Pell is assaulted by her husband at the behest of his Klan buddy Frank Bailey (played by the always dependable Michael Rooker,) to keep her quiet, Anderson wreaks havoc on those he knows are responsible.Stephen Tobolowsky also has a small, but impressive role as Clayton Townley.The end of the film sees most of the defendants found guilty and sentenced to various prison sentences.  Mayor Tilman, although never implicated in the murders, commits suicide.",

I don't understand that it was nominated for best film and Die Hard, a 1988 blockbuster wasn't - now that we're talking cop hero movies. !! Anyway, the only other movie from the hand of director Alan Parker that I remember watching was \"The Life of David Gale\" and to those out there who haven't seen it yet I strongly recommend not to witness this one and only Spacey nightmare because you will be sorry!Now let's focus on the good aspects. I still gave Mississippi burning a 6 because there are some powerful lines in the movie and the acting by Gene Hackman is outstanding. Frances McDormand looks really hot as usual (cfr. the major's secretary in Miller's Crossing - aaauwwwww aaauw aauw aaaaaaauuuuww babyyyyy !!!!). Another Ku Klux Klan tale seemed to me rather unoriginal at the beginning but there were some nice twists in the film which made it well worthy to be keeping track of what would happen next. I checked the movie on IMDb before I zapped to the right channel (as always) to have a look at the rating (7,5). I was so surprised by a promising cast (Willem Dafoe - Platoon, American Psycho, Brad Dourif - One flew over the cuckoos nest, Lee Ermey - Full Metal Jacket) and a whole list of \"official\" appreciations.

But now I really like it. Cuz it really shows the anatomy of hate. It dosen't just show that people hate it also clues you in on WHERE it comes from, kinda. And it's also a movie that \"feels real\". You can \"feel\" some of the characters in this movie, if that makes sense. Everybody did really great. The standout guy is the guy who played the preacher and when he gave that Disturbing \"Anglo Saxon Pride\" Speech. There are *TONS* of standouts parts in the movie, I'm sure some are bound to stick with you. The Interviews with the locals, especially that old white bi*** with her retarded views on certain races' hygienes, the bar where Gene Hackamn comes in and all the KKKmen stare at him disturbingly even as he jokes casually. The fact that all the patrons in the restaurant turn and stare and Gene and Will when they casually talk to the black dudes in there. And the part where the dude beats his wife up. And when the KKK guys show up out of the blue at the black church, call me corny, but I just envision something like that happening in MY church and get CH--ILLS,seriously. (yes I know I'm pathetic.) There were some corny and unbelievable parts,tho. I mean, for the most part it gives you the feel that it's really 1964. Not just a 1988 movie set in 1964. But the only exceptions is the part where the black guy kidnaps the mayor and interrogates him and threatens to cut his b*lls off if he dosen't talk. Um, not to be crass but to quote A Time To Kill: \"That (black man) would be hanging by a tree with HIS b**ls in his mouth\" if the white folks found about about that in those days!..ESPECIALLY in Mississiisppi! (no offense to the MS residence) And then the mayor hangs himself from all the guilt. I just can't PICTURE him doing that! That just SCREAMED UNBELIEABLE PC CORN!!! And showing the FBI as these superheroes coming down and actually giving a shyt about the blacks. Just ask the FBI LEADER Hoover, what he thought. He probably woulda said \"shoove 'em!\" I heard he even thought the Jew Guy Activist was a communist, so please. And the part where the black role is just a meek peasant who gets terrified by Kluckers and they just sit and sulk and preach about it....was...corny. I cared the LEAST about the black roles because of it. They were just there MAINLY to get terrorized and nothing else. It was like (think of an old silent movie): Black person rats *next scene* black persons' house gets blown up. *next scene* black family cries. *next scene* the two FBI agents get mad and THEY alone--do something. (yeah, that black agent DID something, but not a Believable something so don't even try to call me a hypocrite by pointing that out). But in spite of those drawbacks I like it anyway! You can tell cuz I wrote this *MAD* long review!",

Alan Parker has strongly portrayed the truly distraught images of what African Americans had to face on a daily basis.  Some things are worth life if they can promote change in the future.  I was greatly moved by how Aaron Williams (Darius McCrary) had the courage as a young boy to talk to the anglo-saxon agents despite his fear and encouraged other African Americans to step forward.  Mrs. Pell (Frances McDormand) was a strong woman in such a time because she was one of the very few who stood up for what she truly believed in.  Her strength played a big role in proving that you can still remain anonymous while you make your voice heard.  Though she eventually faced great pain, she stuck with her conscience and helped made a difference.  This film is one example that proves the power of voice plays a major role in bringing about change.  I rate this film *****.",

Mississippi Burning falls into neither camp, to question this movies subject, is to blindly deny that these atrocities ever took place. Alan Parker's engaging story is both respectful and non-judgemental.Gene Hackman takes centre stage during a time where he found quality roles difficult to come by, his Rupert Anderson a dogged, experienced veteran Mississippian whose instincts and social skills are essential to the task in hand. Willem Dafoe's young G-man, brash and over-confident brings the authority in an interesting role reversal. McDormand is the heart and humanity, while Brad Dourif looks suitably gleeful despite being the devil (McDormand and Dourif later played husband & wife again in 1991's Hidden Agenda). The rest of the supporting cast are excellent including Gailard Sartain, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Tobin (Jigsaw) Bell and Michael Rooker playing an even more sadistic SOB than Henry Lee Lucas.The story which does take dramatic licence but never loses it's nerve, held together expertly by Englishman Alan Parker. Parker is a Director who knows how to touch the darker recesses of the human condition. The cinematography is suitably Oscar-worthy. The subject matter may be too rich for some people but at it's core is a superb detective, crime movie that doesn't flinch away from atrocities nor embellish them.

With Hackman you see every piece of Masterclass acting, from facial expressions, his laughing, every little detail. While Dafoe couples with Hackman to make them both light up the screen and bring their characters to life. Support from Brad Dourif (Deputy Pell) as the Sheriff's deputy and Michael Rooker as the unashamedly racist Frank, add to the masterclass and all help a fantastic script with some amazing dialogue move along at the perfect pace which if you can keep up with, the rewards from this film are of the highest and most thought provoking ever felt on celluloid.",

Based on the true story of three civil rights workers who went missing in small town Mississippi in 1964, the film stars Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe as FBI agents assigned to investigate the case.  This film is riveting from start to finish and, despite its running time of over two hours, there is not a single throwaway scene over its duration.  Hackman and Dafoe are fantastic, as is Frances McDormand as the wife of a thuggish police officer.  Mississippi Burning makes one realize that America has come a long way since 1964, but still has a long way to go.",

In 2020, it's a despondent take on how nothing ever really changes without a massive impetus, and how, if someone believes that their behavior will be supported by their community, someone will be willing to commit a host of sickening acts. The elements are all there for today's Republican party - \"real American\" patriotism beneath a sickening coat of good ol' boy shellac, shrieking in response to perception of media bias and persecution, culture under attack by \"outside influences\" that must be preserved, claimed violation of civil liberties when the right to suppress is challenged, and ironically massively anti-Christian sensibilities performed in the name of Christ. Tobolowsky as Bowers is virtually a blueprint for today's hyperconservative alt-right idiot figurehead: \"I love Mississippi. THEY hate Mississippi\". Dafoe and Hackman play off each other well in their (admittedly manufactured) contrasting roles. Incorporating visuals from the perspectives of victims and documentary-style snippets alike add to the narrative. The only real criticism from my end is narrative, given that the last half hour or so basically devolves into unrealistic (if satisfactory) revenge porn. Still, a well-made and prescient piece of film regarding race relations in America that is surprisingly unheralded given the fame of the two leads. (4/5)",

            "content": "Films that deal with race relations, particularly from the white perspective, have always been popular with the Academy but this film attracted more controversy than most for playing fast and loose with historical events and focusing on the torture of African-Americans through the eyes of white men. Unsurprisingly despite all of this controversy the film managed to rack up many nominations including one for Best Picture and while it lost to Rain Man (1988) it remains one of the best remembered films of the 1980s. I found a lot to appreciate in the film as it merges a crime thriller with a study of the attitudes of people living in small towns. No, I don't think the film is one of the five best of 1988 but it earns it's nomination more than Working Girl (1988) or Dangerous Liaisons (1988).\n\nTwo Jewish activists and one African-American are murdered by members of the Ku Klux Klan in Jessup County, Mississippi in 1964. Two FBI detectives, the idealistic and inexperienced Alan Ward, Willem Dafoe, and the hardnosed Rupert Anderson, Gene Hackman, who plays by his own rules, are brought in to investigate the murders. They encounter hostility from the locals who support the Klan and begin to suspect that Sherriff Clinton Pell, Brad Dourif, is affiliated with them and is helping to cover up their actions. In order to invalidate the alibi of Pell, Anderson decides to seduce his wife, Frances McDormand, to discover what he was really doing during the murders. The men also form a friendship and move beyond their differences as Ward allows Anderson to employ questionable methods in order to apprehend the men connected to the murders after Pell brutally beats his wife.\n\nThe strength of the film comes from the performances as Hackman is typically brilliant with his natural acting style fitting the tone of the film perfectly and his big showcase scenes really hitting all the right notes. One monologue that he delivers towards the beginning of the film in which he describes how his father murdered an African-American and told him about his reasons for hating black people allows us to see behind this man's fa\u00e7ade and understand what he is driven by. Dafoe is similarly able to imbue his character with a sense of decency as while we know he lacks experience and knowledge we believe that he has good intentions. He has the less showy role but he smartly stands back and lets Hackman chew the scenery while still displaying the tensions simmering just beneath the surface. The supporting players, Dourif and McDormand are convincing as Dourif's eyes are terrifyingly volatile and McDormand's quiet desperation is moving even if her accent work was a little off.\n\nParker's steady direction also helps the film along as he cuts between scenes of violence and the fevered investigation carried out by our two leads skillfully and has an eye for the small details that characterize this town expertly. Much like in Midnight Express (1978) he seems to have a steadier hand than the screenplay he is working with as the theatrics of Oliver Stone allowed for some odd moments in that film and here some of the more cringe inducing moments come from lines in Chris Gerolmo's screenplay. Perhaps the most unnecessary element of the film is the romance between Hackman and McDormand. I would have been happy to see them as friends united by their beliefs but the awkward turn into him bringing flowers to her and them making love were not moments I needed. This is not to say that Hackman and McDormand do not make their best effort to convince us of their romantic attraction but the film as a whole would have been better if this contrived relationship were adjusted.\n\nOther elements of the film that don't quite work include the score which sounds far too modern and the use of rock music in a film set in Mississippi in the 1960s seemed incongruous. Country music or a more orchestral score would have been more fitting and the scenes of violence would have been more effective as a score out of place with the rest of the film was distracting.\n\nFortunately minor flaws were not enough to bring down the whole film and I still took a lot away from the film while still enjoying myself.",

            "content": "A riveting crime thriller that feels shockingly relevant.\n\nMississippi Burning (1988) is directed by Alan Parker with a gritty realism and brutal violence that hits hard. This is a film so startling and infuriating that you will never forget it. It takes on the FBI investigation into the racist hate crimes of the KKK in 1960's America that feels as if this took place in present times, sadly.\n\nParker uses documentary style interviews with the backward racist Mississippi local characters to imbue the audience with a feel for how hateful and regressive the local population in the setting really are to their core. Parker pans the camera around the town constantly showing the average white community member with their distrustful glares and hateful venomous words. Mississippi Burning is a testament to persevering against adversity in the name of justice. No matter how violent and crooked the police and citizens get, the law can always get these criminals.\n\nParker invokes powerful imagery from the first shot of a white man and a black boy drinking from segregated water fountains whose water flows from the same pipe. Mississippi Burning longs for a peaceful country in which black communities will not be terrorized by racist white people. It is a demonstration of the fear tactics Republicans and klan members use to discourage black communities from voting or speaking out against these hate groups. \n\nMississippi Burning effectively displays the harsh and unkind truth that black communities in America constantly feel in danger and oppressed by their white neighbors. However ugly the reality of the situation, Parker captures all the pain and agony with a refreshing truth on camera. His direction is peerless as we see stunning cinematography of this Southern urban wasteland. \n\nParker offers profound reasoning for the hatred with dialogue mentioning the conditions of poverty and ignorance that teach hatred instead of it being born in white Americans.\n\nThe cast is as incredible as the overall film. Willem Dafoe presents the honest justice of the FBI trying to change the country's perception with law and order wonderfully. His resolute stance is so earnest and caring, you cannot help but like Dafoe in Mississippi Burning.\n\nOn the other hand, the gruff and macho Gene Hackman delivers an excellent performance as the more straightforward Southern tough guy. His depiction of a man conflicted by the racist viewings of his upbringing against his righteous attempts at uncovering evidence to convict the murderers is fascinating. Similarly, Frances McDormand gives a great acting performance as a hairdresser taught to be racist from birth that relents on her life choices. You almost feel sorry for her character. These three leading roles carry Mississippi Burning into cinematic greatness.\n\nThe supporting roles are a variety of hideous racist sheriffs like Gailard Sartain's negligent officer to the violently racist and abusive deputies like Brad Dourif's monstrous character. They are as unsettling as Michael Rooker's grotesquely racist character is vile. Lastly, R. Lee Ermey gives a fantastically furious performance as the racist and complacent mayor of this Mississippi town.\n\nI must mention Trevor Jones scored Mississippi Burning with tense synth heavy songs that leave you stuck in the scenes. His ear for how to build suspense is particularly outstanding during the chase sequences in the car.\n\nIn all, Mississippi Burning is a cinematic classic of creative visual direction from Alan Parker matched equally in brilliance by the high caliber acting from Willem Dafoe, Gene Hackman, and Frances McDormand. This movie will frighten, upset, enrage, and shock you. But I feel all the more informed and emboldened to progress America into a more tolerant, accepting, and understanding nation after having witnessed the nightmarish sight that is Mississippi Burning.",

Wow the whole opening is like poetry with the burning church and the water fountain and on top of that, to compliment it, the gospel music in the background. It's almost unbelievable how much unnecessary and ignorant hate there was towards a person who had darker skin. Already I can tell I'm going to be in one hell of a ride. \n\nI don't know why but seeing Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe almost seems to me like Peanut Butter and Jelly. Already I can tell Dafoe character is the straightedged one and Hackman's is the cynical and jokester one. It's crazy to think how ignorant these backwoods hillbilly redneck shit heads were back then. And some of them are still like that even to this day. \n\nIt seems like Gene's character doesn't really care about solving the case because to him, it's not going to make any difference since he knows people in Mississippi ain't going to change. There's still going to be ignorant blissful hate running through all those crackers. I love that quote Hackman says to the mayor, \"Baseball, it's the only time a black man can wave a stick at a white man, and not start a riot\", and then proceeds to wink and puts on his charm that we all know and love. \n\nDafoe's character is getting a bit too carried away with agents, he better be careful. Holy shit that saloon scene with that one ignorant white trash shit head was fucking brilliant. I got so much respect for Gene now that he choked that one guys balls out and left him red. It's so sad and also infuriating at the same time to see just how helpless black people were during that time in Mississippi. They couldn't speak up or else they get beaten up or worse. R. Lee Ermey is great in this movie. He popped in one of his great sayings in there. The injustice that's going in unbelievable. \n\nIt's so weird to see the guy that plays Jigsaw in the Saw movies as an FBI agent in this one. Amazing how they started busting everyone involved with the murders. I'm glad Redemption was met with a nice big prison sentence. Hope them steel bars taste nice when your taking it up the ass. \n\nQuite a powerful movie and will always be relevant. This is essential movie watching.",

And the makers in here, respects both the sides of the political aspects and walks on a fair and clear line. \n\nContrary to what premise promises or suggests, there is a lot more in here to explore than mere investigation procedure and no matter how rudimentary it may be, its metaphorical and satirical tone keeps the audience tangled in its pathos bubble. The background score may not be up front factoring the most, but it certainly has amazing cinematography and fine editing. \n\n\"The buddy cop\" chemistry should actually be like such and it defines it with such subtle panache that leaves long gasping of air whenever they are on screen. As mentioned, the performance is revelation in here where both the lead cast going head to head is one of the primary reason why stakes communicate fluently. \n\nHackman has genuinely invested all his chips in with Dafoe supporting him thoroughly and McDormand proving once again why she is one of the finest actress we have. Gerolmo's exquisite script is justified by Parker's execution skills where he leaves no barrs while conveying the message. \n\nThe inner politics brewed within the period depicted (the tables turning half way through the tale is not only unexpected but utterly pleasing to encounter too), Hackman and Dafoe sharing wisdom through funny bits and their performance that binds it all, are the high points of the feature. \n\nMississippi Burning is more than the genre could title it for, as it is essentially husky and cunningly crispy for the entire majestic two hours.",

Its pretty obvious that the black community wouldn't have reached anything if they would have let fight their fight by white people...all they achieved they did by putting their own skin at risk.

Martin Luther King gave his I have a dream speech, Malcolm X was assissanted along with MLK, The march on Selma happened, the Freedom Riders and the murders of Civil rights workers. Mississippi Burning winds the clocks back to 64 when those murders happened. The movie looks at the efforts of two FBI agents to find some measure of justice for the blacks in the south, but just like any task of this kind it is not easy.\n\tAlan Ward and Rupert Anderson are sent down from DC to Mississippi to investigate the disappearance of three civil right workers. Ward is a deadest no nonsense agent while Anderson is a bit of shady realist type agent who knows the south well. Ward and Anderson quickly find out how much the a small town in the state is on edge and how the KKK has installed fear in everyone, especially the blacks. This makes the investigation the agents came down for that much harder.\nits very real film about a time where everything was tense. Alan parker really captures mississipi well at this time. it was a real nightmare for blacks. I mean parker does a really great job of instilling a tenseness in the atmosphere of Mississippi. the racism in the state is so evident thanks to this. interesting how they applied the news broadcast elements into it as well with the interviews. adds a sense of realism to this ficitional story based on real events\ngene Hackman never seems to disappoint. Anderson knows the ways of this small town and yet makes it really unclear if he is trying to derail wards investigation or is trying to give him the right guidance in solving this murder. he played him as not only someone who jumps both sides of the fence but is fearless against the white supremiscts of the south. willem defoe plays an slightly idealistic and no nonsense man who doesn't know what he's messing with here in Mississippi. frances mcdormand was excellent here! I was worried she was gonna play a generic like character but this one was intriguing as she was one of the few townsfolk to actually sympathize with black folks and was fascinated by this rare attempt at order by the fbi agents\nI really liked the script for this film It was so nicely written. I liked the music too I was trying to find that main theme online but no luck. Anyway folks go check out Mississippi Burning",

You live it... you breathe it. You marry it.\"\n\nAlan Parker's 1988 film which was nominated for seven Academy Awards is another reminder of what a great career Gene Hackman had, although this time he got to share the spotlight with a pair of other wonderful performances from Willem Dafoe and Frances McDormand. The fact that Mississippi Burning isn't even considered one of Hackman's top ten most popular films just proves how many great films he's made over the span of five decades (he retired from acting in 2004). Since the film was loosely based on a real incident surrounding the disappearance of some civil rights workers in the south during the 60's many people complained that the film wasn't faithful to the story, but Parker never made such a claim and always said his film was a fictional tale of events that could've taken place during the time so I don't see any need to complain about it. Some similarities can be found with the classic film directed by Norman Jewison, In the Heat of the Night, which handles a similar theme about racism. Films like this are important reminders of how dangerous humans can be when they let hate and racism govern their hearts. It is so easy at times to forget those dark moments in our history and act like they never happened, but once in a while we get films like Mississippi Burning that remind us of the horrors of humanity and the sacrifice people made to end them. These are films with important messages which also happen to be well made and count with a stellar cast. Its only Oscar win was for Peter Biziou's wonderful cinematography, but there is so much more worth recommending about this classic from the 80's. \n\nThe film introduces us to three civil rights workers as they are detained by a police vehicle while they were about to exit a small Mississippi town. The officers begin making all sorts of hateful remarks towards these men and violently shoot them for trying to stir up their quiet and organized segregated town. A few days later, two FBI agents show up in town looking for these disappeared citizens, who they fear have been murdered. Agent Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) is in charge of the operation despite his young age. His partner, Agent Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman), is more experienced and is not afraid to speak his mind about him as someone he believes to be well educated but lacking more field work. Ward likes to do things by the books, but Anderson who was a former Sheriff in a similar Mississippi town knows the mentality of these places and believes his methods won't get them anywhere in a place like this. The Mayor (R. Lee Ermey) isn't pleased with the agents visit because he believes his segregation methods work and that things are run differently here than in the south. The agents learn it quickly while they're trying to collaborate with the local officers. Sheriff Ray Stuckey (Gaylord Sartain) is very protective of his boys, especially of Deputy Clinton (Brad Dourif) and officer Frank (Michael Rooker) who were the officers involved in the murder. It doesn't take the agents too long to realize what happened, but they can't find anyone in town who will speak to them since the victims have been threatened by the KKK. Every time someone seems to be interested in speaking up, they are immediately intimidated by the gang through violent acts. Ward's tactics don't seem to have an effect, but Anderson may have found the perfect ally in Mrs. Pell (Frances McDormand), the Deputy's wife who rejects his actions. \n\nThe script handles the civil rights case with care and avoids falling into melodramatic territory by remaining gripping and suspenseful. There are plenty of thrills along the way and some violent scenes that are actually less horrifying than the hateful things these men say. It's true that the civil right theme is told through a white's man point of view, but I think it still remains compelling and well intentioned. In the end it becomes entirely a revenge action film, but it's handled in a convincing and realistic way. Hackman, Dafoe, and McDormand are in the center of the movie and they all deliver gripping performances playing off each other extremely well. Brad Dourif and Michael Rooker are given the stereotypical racist characters who are very easy to hate. Rooker seems to be playing the same character from The Walking Dead series only this time he actually acts upon his remarks more than simply being a loud mouth. Hackman and Dafoe are on the same side despite having very different approaches and that difference helps build the tension and relationships in the film. Parker's sensitive direction works in a film with such a controversial subject matter that could be easily manipulated. Mississippi Burning is a classic that shouldn't be missed by fans of Gene Hackman and his impressive career.          \n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "I thought it was terrible. The whole point of the film is summed up in the last shot of a broken tombstone that reads \"1964 - not forgotten.\" Maybe they should have left this story buried. \n\nThe first hour of the movie put me in a real sour mood. Nothing but racist talk and violence. If you're a real racist you might actually get a kick out of this movie. There's no characters to like. Everyone acts in a stiff way and boring way to pull off the dumb redneck. Dafoe is very bland and a bit autistic, I think. A weird thing I noticed is that he sounds exactly like Agent Smith in The Matrix. He even wears a suit like Agent Smith. Hackman's name in the movie is Anderson and Dafoe says it like in The Matrix, like there's a period between each syllable of his name. The point of the appearance and speech pattern of Agent Smith was to show him as just a generic, unnoticeable nobody. Someone who would blend into a crowd. A faceless computer program. It was appropriate in The Matrix, but Dafoe's Agent Smith impression made the character distant and unreadable. He's dull, but at least he's a good man. Hackman's character made no sense to me. The way his character develops, he starts out racist enough, especially with all his black jokes, to not like him. He's also creepy around women. He seems like a redneck himself at times. But then half way through the film, for no real explained reason, the movie acts as if he was always a nice guy. Very weird. I still didn't like him. But at least he was the only person in the entire movie to give a lively performance. Also, I'm not use to seeing people behave this way in movies so the characters seemed very unfamiliar to me. It didn't elevate the cinematic experience, but if they were proper representations of people back then it's interesting and unpleasant.\n\nI didn't care for the other characters either because I didn't like them or I didn't know who they are. If I was black I don't think I'd feel empowered by this film. It's just a grim reminder of a past event. It's depressing. A young black boy is in it for a little bit. He doesn't do much, and then he's gone for the whole movie. Besides that boy, I hate to say it, but it felt to me like the black people in the movie were just props in a film about white people. The most glaring example is how through the movie were shown hate crime after hate crime, and after each crime things settle down and the movie resumes like nothing happen. But when Frances McDormand got beaten up that's when the CIA agents lose their cool and show a little emotion. Only when a white person gets hurt does the movie show a little enthusiasm to seek justice. Only that character is assigned any meaningful importance. And besides the black women singing at the end, who we don't know, the resolve of the movie is about Hackman and the woman talking. Is this a movie about blacks or women? Women's rights are important, but considering the context of the film I just thought it didn't celebrate justice for black people enough. If it wasn't for the excessive racist talk and violence toward blacks you'd forget this is a film about civil rights.\n\nWhat it reminded me of is a bad slasher movie. We know who the killers are right away and after that we just follow the detectives and listen to people be racist. With all the violence thrown in it's like a slasher movie where you know the killer right away and the rest of the movie is just uncreative and disgusting death scenes that grow on your nerves. Or like watching Faces of Death. What puts me off is how the movie doesn't pick a side. It's just telling the story. There's no emotion in the movie. Hackman gets mad when the woman is beat up. Dafoe is like an android. The only real emotion in the film is the rednecks anger towards blacks which just hangs in the air, meaningless and offensive, and the emotion you yourself put into it. The shocking hate crimes didn't make me emotional, it just made me disgusted. The movie was like watching a real video of whites beating up blacks. I wouldn't give a video like that 5 stars. \n\nI know this is based on a true story. My review is entirely about my experience with the movie and my criticism of the characterizations. As a movie it didn't work for me. Look at movies about WWII like Schindler's List and The Pianist. That's what this movie should have been like. The content of the story just isn't big enough to support the importance of the subject matter.\n\nThe second half of the film was better, but not by much. It's ruined by the first half, anyway. The only thing I liked about it the beginning with the three men getting killed. A very tense moment. At the beginning of a movie you don't expect flushed out characters so it works there. And the car chase scene was done well. The rednecks were driving away with a black man they were going to beat up, but Dafoe says not to follow until the cop goes back inside. That scene was good because you were thinking \"hurry up and go!!!\" The movie so reminded me of a horror movie I expected the car not to start.",

But sadly, most of the antagonists and side characters are one-dimensional stereotypes, the music blares to let you know when a scene is important, and much of the plot feels repetitive instead of building to a climax.

            "content": "An acclaimed film back in 1988, Mississippi Burning still shines and is capable of striking a chord within you on your feelings and views on racism. With remarkable performances, aggressive direction and a cracking pace, this is superb cinema, even if the historical accuracy leaves much to be desired. Slick, well-acted thriller that nonetheless distorts the facts and looks at the civil rights movement from a strictly white perspective. Parker pushes the picture along at a fervent clip, with the character scenes back-to-back with chases or violence. The music in Mississippi Burnin is phenomenal; there are a lot of gospel songs for example the song by Vesta Williams '' Try Jesus ''. There is also a tune in the film when something bad is about to happen, when you hear it for the first time in the movie recognize the tune immediately, when you hear it you feel uncomfortable and are at the tip of your seat. The movie knows to capture the right atmosphere for a movie with such a theme like this one has. It means that the movie has some effective cinematography and picked some good settings. Its strength is that whilst dramatizing the hot bed of racism in the 60s it still manages to deliver an entertaining storyline which means you want to watch and when you want to watch you take it all in. The performances were great, Hackman, Dafoe and McDormand shine, as well as the rest of the supporting cast. Alan Parker's direction is superb in this film, making the rest fall into place and coming up with big results.\n\nVERDICT: \"High-Quality Stuff\" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD. It is not perfect, but it is definitely excellent. (Films that are rated 3.5 or 4 stars)",

            "content": "I think in this review of \"Mississippi Burning,\" I need to be careful on what to say about it. To start off, it was well done and well made within its horrific atmosphere. The best of the picture next to karmas was the performances of Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe at their best. Their chemistry is quite similar to the chemistry between Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman in \"All the President's Men\" when investigating for answers without receiving any cooperation but threats instead.\n\nSo to sum it up: \"Mississippi Burning\" is a well-done, brave dramatization with a horrific atmosphere, and the performances of its main duo lightens things up as they crack the corrupted Mississippi to sweat and weaken. (B+)\n\nIf you want to read more of the review, read further to get to the truth that's based on my opinion.\n\nWhat makes this a brave dramatization directed by Alan Parker was the portrayal on how monstrous the white people were (*are if there are still some disgracing the race) at that time of the unreasonable segregation. My blood boils whenever I see a monstrous white mistreating, disrespecting and hurting an innocent a black person who doesn't deserve that.\n\nTo describe my daydreaming thoughts when I was watching this movie, I was imagining myself as Christopher Nolan's Batman protecting the black people and anyone from harm from monsters as the world is Gotham City and Mississippi is Arkham.\n\n Now you see why I need to be careful on what I write or I'll probably be threatened like how Hackman's and Dafoe's characters were when they were digging deep into the mystery of the disappearance of three civil-rights workers. The investigation was pleasantly causing the monstrous whites to sweat from their skull(?), and weak enough to show that they're truly brainless monsters with no respect and that we're right about them being that way at that time whereas for unknown reason they'd turned into lazy chickens and started disrespecting the black people. Oops, this rebellious, expressionist white has said it already.\n\nLast year with the releases of \"42,\" \"The Butler,\" \"Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom\" and the 2014 Best Picture winner \"12 Years a Slave,\" I think I came across on an article that was about that the white people want these kind of productions to stop portraying their race as monsters. What I need to say about that is that these kind of movies were showing the world the truth dramatized. So it seems that the white people were getting shamed by what they've become and were given karma for what they've done (pretty sure karmas were given individually that's more than what the dramatizations were telling). So it seems that they've gave up when the truth was dramatized times before. It also seems that they want the truth buried so they can be forgiven and the past to be forgotten. (The whites I'm talking about are the monstrous ones in that era).",

            "content": "After three civil rights workers in Mississippi are reported missing in 1964, two FBI agents are sent to investigate the incident in rural Jessup County, Mississippi. The two agents take completely different approaches: Agent Alan Ward (Dafoe), a young liberal northerner, takes a direct approach to the investigation; Agent Rupert Anderson (Hackman), a former Mississippi sheriff who understands the intricacies of race relations in the South, takes a more subtle tack. It is very hard for the two to work in the town, as the local sheriff's office is linked to a major branch of the Ku Klux Klan, and the agents cannot talk to the local black community, due to their fear of Klan retaliation. Slowly but steadily, relations between the FBI and the local Jessup County sheriff's office deteriorate, as do relations between Ward and Anderson. Things boil over when the bodies are found and the deputy sheriff, Clinton Pell (Brad Dourif), realizes that his wife gave their locations to Anderson, and he assaults her. When Anderson sees her in the hospital, he storms off to confront Pell but is stopped by Ward. After a violent fight and battle of wills, the two agree that they will work together to bring down the Jessup County branch of the Ku Klux Klan using Anderson's as yet untried approach...\n\nThis is a strong and very difficult film from Alan Parker with specifically Gene Hackman in a fantastic form. The dynamics between Ward and Anderson and their strong will to do whatever it takes to bring down the guilty (even if they want to do it in different ways) and with a truly terrible backdrop of racism in the 60s makes an emotional film that will stay with you forever. I had forgotten some parts of it from since I saw \"Mississippi Burning\" at the movies in 1988, but all the difficult scenes were vivid in my mind. I reckon \"Mississippi Burning\" should be shown for everyone to get a grip of the terrible act of racism. A topic that is still way too current today. Despite the criticism of not being entirely accurate storywise the message it is still very strong and to the point.",

I know it's not a subject matter that some may feel is relevant today, but it's still a very powerful piece of cinema and deserves recognition for that, if nothing else. Here's a very brief summary before I give you my thoughts.\n\nWhen three civil rights activists go missing in a small town in Mississippi in 1964, the FBI is called in to investigate. In charge is the younger Agent Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) with the much older and wiser Agent Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) in tow. Having got short shrift from the local sheriff, Ray Stuckley (Gailard Sartain), Ward tries to speak to some of the black residents of the town, this does not go down well and results in those he had spoken to being beaten for their trouble. Eventually the car the missing men had been driving is found and Ward brings in more men, a lot of them. Suspicion falls on Deputy Clinton Pell (Brad Dourif), but he has the whole town covering for him, including his wife (Frances McDormand). Anderson befriends her but she will not budge on her story. It seems the whole town is scared of the KKK, but nobody wants to speak about it. Eventually though they get a break and Ward reluctantly agrees to use Anderson's somewhat cavalier methods. Does it pay off? Well I guess that would be a spoiler now wouldn't it.\n\nAlthough based on real events, the filmmakers go to great lengths to make it clear that this is a work of fiction. As such it works very well; it is a very powerful drama that puts the fight for civil rights to the fore. I must say I found it quite thought provoking, very well made and really well shot. The performances were all excellent with (for me), Gene Hackman standing out; although I thought Willem Dafoe was very good and Brad Dourif was excellent as the loathsome Deputy Pell. I also have to mention a couple of small roles; it was nice to see both Stephen Tobolowsky as Clayton Townley and R. Lee Ermey as Mayor Tilman; I know they didn't have an awful lot to do, but they were both quality. Over all, an interesting drama that kept me interested all the way through - a definite 'must' for any cinephile.\n\nSteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\n\nMy score: 8.7/10.\n\n\n\nThere are extra bits & pieces (photos, links, trailer and BIGGER PRINT) on my blog at:\nhttp://thoughtsofasteelmonster.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/film-review-mississippi-burning-1988.html\n\nEnjoy!... :)",

Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) and Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) are the FBI agents sent to investigate. Anderson is a more traditional, older agent who believed that in order to catch the scum, you had to sink to their level. His partner Ward was the complete opposite, young and played by the book. The pair soon realise what they are up against in the south.\n\nAlthough based on a true case, it couldn't be more of a mainstream film. In the true Hollywood style the two agents assigned to the case are completely different, and nothing like the agents actually in charge of the case. Furthermore, Mississippi Burning chooses only to portray the white in the south as rednecks, which resulted in white southerners claiming the film to be prejudice. However, the worst part all of this for me is how Parker doesn't even attempt to show the effect the KKK had from a black perspective. For a large portion the blacks are seen as silent victims and nothing else, mostly only present for the most violent scenes.\n\nAfter saying all of this though, some of the scenes where visually exceptional. The scene which involves the terrorisation of a black church by the Klan is extremely powerful, and also the sub-plot involving Mrs. Pell (Frances McDormand), the wife of a Klan member who is regularly beaten, is at times simply horrific.\n\nActing throughout the film was overall excellent, with both Gene Hackman and Frances McDormand receiving Oscar nominations. A good visual and stylistic film, but content-wise it is just wrong.\n\nJ.Henderson.\n\n5.5/10.",

Hackman and Dafoe are left to deal with the issues here but that wasn't enough for me-  there's a faith that is lost in Dafoe's character here and I understand that completely but what about those who suffered the most, the victims of these terrible tragedies, had they lost hope too? I'm not given an answer and without it I can't say that this moved me- it got to me, of course it did, but beyond the violence and the hatred and loss of hope there was nothing that showed the strength in humanity that would prevail- this is more than a police drama, it should be, it needs to be and yet its not- its \"edgy\"  if you'll forgive such a vague statement but its not the analysis that I wanted- it gives us the description but there's more to this story, most importantly, there is something to take beyond the misery and fear. Instead of showing that we  are left with a misplaced love story and some very-general crime drama characteristics. I simply wanted this to be more, whether that's fair of me or not I do not know but its how I feel.\n\nThe performances are great and there's some very memorable scenes also as well as a great job from Parker all-round really. All of my criticisms have been addressed above- the rest is as good as it could be.",

Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) and Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe) are the FBI agents sent to investigate. Anderson is a more traditional, older agent who believed that in order to catch the scum, you had to sink to their level. His partner Ward was the complete opposite, young and played by the book. The pair soon realise what they are up against in the south.\n\nAlthough based on a true case, it couldn't be more of a mainstream film. In the true Hollywood style the two agents assigned to the case are completely different, and nothing like the agents actually in charge of the case. Furthermore, Mississippi Burning chooses only to portray the white in the south as rednecks, which resulted in white southerners claiming the film to be prejudice. However, the worst part all of this for me is how Parker doesn't even attempt to show the effect the KKK had from a black perspective. For a large portion the blacks are seen as silent victims and nothing else, mostly only present for the most violent scenes.\n\nAfter saying all of this though, some of the scenes where visually exceptional. The scene which involves the terrorisation of a black church by the Klan is extremely powerful, and also the sub-plot involving Mrs. Pell (Frances McDormand), the wife of a Klan member who is regularly beaten, is at times simply horrific. \n\nActing throughout the film was overall excellent, with both Gene Hackman and Frances McDormand receiving Oscar nominations. A good visual and stylistic film, but content-wise it is just wrong.\n\nJ.Henderson.\n\n5.5/10.",

This is one of many examples of a film that is put together just in time for the Academy Awards to get nominated multiple times. Films shouldn't be nominated or awarded if they are \"whats new and talked about right now\" or if an actor may be \"due up\" for an award. Francis McDormand and Hackman were outstanding but it gets me down when my favorite actor Dafoe gets out-shined, looks out of place, or doesn't live up to expectations. Mississippi Burning is another example of a page in our history books being retold in inaccurate, exaggerated Hollywood form. \n\n2/5",

It's a gripping and heavy going expose on one of the darkest hours of America's recent history, and one which should never happen again. It's got a brilliant cast and Parker captures the era well. In Jessup County, Mississippi in 1964, three civil rights workers are murdered by a group of bigots, they were detained by the police then released before they were pounced upon. The FBI send two agents to investigate the crime, Agent Rupert Anderson (Gene Hackman) and Agent Alan Ward (Willem Dafoe). Anderson was a sheriff in Mississippi years earlier, and knows too well of the prejudices people have, while Ward is a liberal and is very direct. They first interview Deputy Clinton Pell (Brad Dourif), who both agents believe had a hand in the murders. But when the local Ku Klux Klan threaten the agents, they call for back-up of 100 agents. Meanwhile, Anderson gets information from Pell's wife (Frances McDormand), who has been told to keep quiet about what really happened. It's a powerful and shocking crime mystery, you can't believe people were like this towards blacks and indeed other races in that part of America, and there's still a small minority who hold on to such beliefs. Parker gets the best from his cast, and his crew (all from England) bring Mississippi of the 1960's back to vivid life.",

It is certainly hard to watch at some points; this film does not hold back, and it illustrates the irrational hatred against black Americans in a disturbing (but accurate) manner, to the point where the viewer feels as helpless as the innocent victims. The dynamic between Dafoe and Hackman's characters is genius, and surprisingly, there are many funny moments throughout the film to lighten the mood.

Depicting such a delicate concept, the feature is surprisingly bold and obviously poignant with some indelible gut wrenching visuals. And the makers in here, respects both the sides of the political aspects and walks on a fair and clear line. Contrary to what premise promises or suggests, there is a lot more in here to explore than mere investigation procedure and no matter how rudimentary it may be, its metaphorical and satirical tone keeps the audience tangled in its pathos bubble. The background score may not be up front factoring the most, but it certainly has amazing cinematography and fine editing. \"The buddy cop\" chemistry should actually be like such and it defines it with such subtle panache that leaves long gasping of air whenever they are on screen. As mentioned, the performance is revelation in here where both the lead cast going head to head is one of the primary reason why stakes communicate fluently. Hackman has genuinely invested all his chips in with Dafoe supporting him thoroughly and McDormand proving once again why she is one of the finest actress we have. Gerolmo's exquisite script is justified by Parker's execution skills where he leaves no barrs while conveying the message. The inner politics brewed within the period depicted (the tables turning half way through the tale is not only unexpected but utterly pleasing to encounter too), Hackman and Dafoe sharing wisdom through funny bits and their performance that binds it all, are the high points of the feature. Mississippi Burning is more than the genre could title it for, as it is essentially husky and cunningly crispy for the entire majestic two hours.",
