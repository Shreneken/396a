            "content": "but on the other hand it's not the funniest movie ever made and it's just a rehash of the last 5 movies, but it's STILL good and worth watching if you've nothing better to do & obiously if you've seen the first 5. There isn't much of a story but what there is of it consists of a gang of 3 goons who work for a MR BIG bringing down property prices by going on a City wide crime-wave with the Academy the only people who can stop them.. and that's about it Of course there's loads of slaptick mainly down to the inept Capt. Harris and partner LT.Proctor. Most of the other usual cast remains What with Bubba Smith (hightower) doing his strong man thing, Leslie Easterbrook (Callahan) doing her strong ass-kicking woman thing & The late David Graf (Tackleberry) doing his gung-ho ass-kicking stuff that we've seen in all the other 5 movies so It might get tiresome for hard to please critics, but for a bit of lightweight entertainment that won't tax your Brain too much it's nigh on Unbeatable My vote for what it's worth 7/10.Followed by Police Academy 7: Mission to Moscow the last movie which flopped at the Box-office (maybe it was an academy too many for film fans who though they'd suffered enough)",

This time the story is about a gang (well, there's 3 of them anyway), who keep on robbing juwelry stores and banks along a busroute... but why, and how?! And who is their secret boss?Oh well, never mind the plot. It's just a filler between the sketches of the heroes and their peculiarities. The strong Hightower, gun crazed Tackleberry, big-breasted Callahan and the rest of them. We all know them from before, and once you've seen one episode, you kinda saw them all.Weak point of the movie is the absence of Mahoney (the star of the series) and Zed (the funniest). Best scene is when Jones takes on one of the gangmembers in Bruce Lee style. Oh well, I had some laughs, and City Under Siege won't be in my bottom 100. I'd give it 4/10.",

            "content": "In \"Police Academy 6: City Under Siege\", the gang's all here to save a crime-ridden city from the wrath of 3 white guys named the Wilson Heights Gang...I imagine this complicated premise was pitched to Warner Bros execs something to the effect of \"Um, they like to rob stuff...and they're bad guys. Oh, and the city's under siege because of them.\" I know this is slapstick and it was never intentioned to be taken seriously, but even when writing a film like this you have to TRY, at least TRY to write something good!!Anyway, the cast is all here, again, and they're not unlike the line of lower-income, shady low-lifes I see waiting outside the Department of Labor office every morning to pick up their unemployment checks. I don't think these guys even bother auditioning for other parts anymore, they're all blacklisted for life. There's Lt. Harris, once funny and a believable antagonist, now a cartoonish straight man to his bumbling apprentice Proctor, the two of them like some ill-fated and painfully unfunny Abbot & Costello bit that goes on too long. Way, way, waaaaay too long. There's Hightower, for the sixth time, he's big and black. Really big and black. Ha-ha-ha. Hooks and Tackleberry are here, oh Lord, don't forget about Hooks and Tackleberry...she's mousy and timid but sometimes she yells loudly, and T-man, he's a walking arsenal who loves guns! Most interesting though is Nick McCoy (I can't remember the character name) who's simply a modern replacement for Steve Guttenberg and his Carey Mahoney. Both are bright-eyed and boyish, both the unofficial leader of the gang. Put all these guys together and you have...well, you have...you have a cast, I guess.Police Academy 6 should have been the end. The sad, painful end to a once respectable series (meaning the first P.A. only) that had gone on seemingly forever, like that old uncle who lives in Jersey who's 103 and can't walk or talk, just lays in bed and mumbles in pain with everyone waiting for him to pass on and finally be at peace. Instead, a seventh police academy was made. It never made it to the theaters and I have yet to see it, but I remember seeing its preview in the movies some years back...as soon as the title and Robert Folk's Academy March started, a universal groan filled the theater. I think the marketing execs were in that theater and got the idea. But don't worry, Academy fans, I'm sure there'll be an eighth and a ninth, and a tenth...it will outlive us all, this series. And true genius is never recognized in its own time.",

            "content": "Finally, almost done with the Police Academy sequels, I finished the 6th movie in the series, Police Academy 6: City Under Siege, now this movie by no means is the worst movie ever, but it's the weaker of the movies and disappoints more than makes you laugh. With the earlier sequels, I've been surprised, with all the low ratings, I still was laughing at the movies, just because I think people were taking the movies too seriously or comparing too much to the original Police Academy. Now the last Police Academy may not have had Mahony, Steve Guttenberg's character, but it still made me laugh, but I miss the old gang, they were what made the sequels a lot of fun. I also once again missed Zed and Sweetchuck, certain characters just made these movies into fun comedies, but City Under Siege tries too hard.The class is back together to save the city from jewelery thieves, but the plot thickens when they find out that the leader of the gang is connected with the police. But of course Harris is after all the credit of making the bust on the jewelery thieves and taking the credit, even by mocking the old class that always pull something over their heads. But they find out that there is something deeper than just having the jewels, the thieves are going to own this town unless the police academy stops them.Police Academy 6: City Under Siege still delivers some really good laughs here and there, you always have to love the pranks the class pulls on Harris, G.W. Baily plays them off so well and makes the memorable. Also you have to love Bubba Smith who is the classic big guy you just don't wanna mess with. But as far as the sequels go, this was without a doubt the weaker, from what I understand Mission in Moscow is the worst, so I'm going to do my best to have faith and just hope the series ends with a bang. Police Academy 6: City Under Siege, I recommend it if you are looking to see the series, but as a comedy, it's just alright.3/10",

You will have seen most of the jokes before, and it's fair to say there isn't a huge deal of originality, but it's easy viewing. The gang are a bit ridiculous, but I love The idea of Mr Big, and the scenes of the hidden Mastermind are really funny, great voice.It's great that most of the original cast are here, all doing their thing, Tackleberry and Hooks are great fun as always, but it's Harris that steals the show for me. As always a shame we don't have Mahoney.It gets slated, and if you read some of the reviews you'd believe it was awful, it isn't, it's not great, but it's better than its reputation suggests, infinitely more funny than the awful follow up. 6/10",

            "content": "City Under Siege is the sixth of the Police Academy movies, a series of satires on modern America almost Swiftian in their subtlety.To be honest, as a film anorak, I was tempted to give this one a miss, as I hate watching movies out of sequence. Over the years I've possibly seen all of the Academy franchise, but never in order. So coming to this one fresh I felt like I was missing out on all the finely tuned story arcs and character development. Like how did the guy who makes sound effects with his mouth all the time go to just making sound effects quite a lot? And what caused the dizzy, shouty one to change to a dizzy one who sometimes only talks loudly?As this was made in the tail end of the 80s the dodgy politics that plagued the early ones are thankfully absent, and there's a better atmosphere too. Okay, Steve Guttenberg no longer being in it automatically takes the smugness level down 50%, but years of critical slating have lent humility to the cast. There's a real air of \"so bad it's good\" playing here, rather than the first few where the actors seemed to genuinely believe they had decent material.But it's not all positive, and the absence of other cast members is a worry. Didn't there use to be someone funny in Police Academy? Maybe I imagined it. Still, the loss of Bobcat Goldthwait and Tim Kazurinksy is something to be noted, and we're left with a pretty asinine bunch. Possibly the worst is Bruce Mahler as Fackler, an accident-prone cop instigating wearily mistimed and predictable slapstick sequences.What's great about the Police Academy series is how it unites everyone - the humour is so low-brow that even really thick people don't find it funny. I did get a few ironic laughs at how poor some of it was - like Harris running when his feet are stuck through the bottom of a moving van. Generally, though, it's of the strictly lame variety.There are people that could make it work - think of Chaplin, Laurel, Lloyd or Allen superglued to a chair and, even though it's a cheap gag, you might laugh. But when it's G.W.Bailey directed by Peter Bonerz you're talking a chuckle vacuum.There's a scene where the blue-eyed boring one and the silly noises one enter a \"Comedy Pub\" to quieten it down after a blackout. In a scene of pure wish-fulfilment, Michael Winslow gets on the stage and brings the house down. Yeah, right... if only. His Hendrix impression is good, mind. He gets one of the big finales, too, slugging it out with a villain while he does his \"badly dubbed Bruce Lee\" schtick. How many times has he done that anyway? Surely even his own mother wasn't laughing at this stage.However, the semblance of some sort of plot and the presence of three genuine laughs - more than in all the other Police Academy movies stuck together - take this one up to a mighty 3/10.",

Bonus points to him for getting Gerrit Graham (Terrorvision, Phantom of the Paradise) to join up!Commandant Lassard (George Gaynes) assembles his finest men and women for the case, including Hightower (Bubba Smith), Tackleberry (David Graf), Jones (Michael Winslow), Hooks (Marion Ramsey), Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook), Fackler (Bruce Mahler), and Mahoney replacement and his nephew, Nick (Matt McCoy).Billie Byrd is in this, but she's playing a totally different role and not Mrs. Feldman, so if you demand continuity in your 80's comedies, you're out of luck.That is, however, Grandmaster Melle Mel in this. And Allison Mack, the one-time Smallville actress who charged with sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy as part of her role in the NXIVM sex cult. Who would have guessed?The following year Paul Maslansky would produce Ski Patrol, which he had hoped would replace Police Academy and have several sequels. It failed, as did this movie. There wouldn't be another Police Academy film for five more years.",

The Mayor wants Harris and Proctor to work with Police Academy head Commandant Lassard (George Gaynes) on apprehending a gang formed by three nasty hoodlums commanded by a mysterious boss .

The cadets are training for an all new adventureThis funny but inferior entry deals with the group of botcher police officers are assembled to carry out risked missions and to find some escaped robbers . As our unfortunate cadets take to the streets when three inept goons successfully orchestrate a metropolitan crime wave. Amusing , fun and cheerful film filled with action-packed , thrills , hilarious set-pieces, tongue-in-cheek and lots of humor . Based on the roles created by Neal Israel and Pat Proft , this time the script writer is the unknown Stephen Curwick who provides a really disconcerting and absurd storyline. More predictable idiocy from the cop shop and no real story to speak of , just more high jinks in this mindless follow-up. The premise is simple and plain , as the misfit , botcher team from the known police force are called to a new assignment and there they get in trouble with some nasty delinquents . Director Peter Bornerz delivers a mediocre professional work but with no much interest, with knack enough of getting the most out of characters and situations without ever going over the top making for some laughs . This production pays tribute to previous films , this time the motley, bumbling group confronts the local crime , repeating former sketches, taking parts here and there . The jokes and frolics come as thick and fast , hit and miss as usual and it is done in good spirit if not always in good taste . Regular picture with accent on sight gags , and humour that stems from the diverting roles established in other movies . The sympathetic cast formed by the motley band of misfits gives fun interpretation creating confusion , laughs and chaos . Appearing habitual actors in the popular series, such as Bubba Smith as Hightower , Michael Winslow : Jones, Leslie Easterbrook : Callahan, Marion Ramsey : Hooks , Lance Kinsey : Proctor and adding two newcomers: Matt McCoy who formerly appeared in Assignment Miami Beach and a goofy cop played by Bruce Mahler . It contains an attractive and thrilling score by Robert Folk , series' regular , including the classic leitmotif . As well as atmospheric and appropriate cinematography by Charles Rosher Jr . The motion picture made in short budget was regular but professionally directed by Peter Bonerz. Rating : 4.5/10 . Below average only for fans of the Police Academy saga.The series based on the characters written by Neal Israel and Pat Proft is formed by the following ones : Police Academy 1984 by Hugh Wilson . Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment 1985 by Jerry Paris , James Signorelli . Police Academy 3: Back in Training 1987 by Jerry Paris . Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol 1987 by Jim Drake .

Naturally someone is behind this whole operation so be prepared for a truly ball bustin' twist...nah not really.Yet again I am amazed at the continuity of these films and the fact all of the cast are still present and correct...bar Guttenberg who went AWOL after number four. This time round we have all the regular officers plus Fackler makes a welcome return and Nick Lassard is still here replacing Mahoney.First time ever we actually have a PA film where there aren't any training sequences, this time its all about the main team going up against a trio of super criminals. The criminals are actually quite good too I might add, totally clich\u00e9d of course but they are meant to be equals for three of the main PA characters. One guy is a huge bald fat biker looking dude, his strength is errr...strength, so he goes up against Hightower. Then we have a slim athletic guy who is good at martial arts and gymnastics, guess who he goes up against. And finally a smooth well dressed ladies man type who is a sharp shooter and dead eye with guns...yep, Tackleberry.This film relies more on bumbling cops n robbers type of stuff, Harris and Proctor getting set up and constantly missing the chance to make a simple arrest. Not so many pranks, nudity or rudeness, just simple childish 'Pink Panther' styled buffoonery but more idiotic and predictable if that's possible.Kenneth Mars tries to liven up the film with his cartoonish Mayor character but it falls flat. You can see they are trying to capture the madness he brought to 'Young Frankenstein' but it just doesn't work, too stupid and not funny. I did like Gerrit Graham as the aptly named Ace (the sharp shooter criminal) and the little showdown between the three criminals and three officers, the best bit in the film really. Bailey does well again as Harris but the few pranks are way too infantile this time.Over all its not a bad film really, its still better than number four and about on par with number five. I do like the darkly lit, noir- ish visuals they attempt in this one, clearly going for that Bogart-like detective quality in places. The whole thing is actually more akin to a typical pulp comic book adaptation, along the lines of 'Dick Tracy' or 'The Shadow'...albeit a very dumb simplified version. So kudos for that approach, not great by any means but a fair effort bearing in mind this is the sixth film.5/10",

I have given my thoughts on each film and, attached to each review, a tad bit more insight into the series itself from my own personal viewpoint. The tension is building. Just think -- one more review after this and I will have reviewed all seven films. Will there be any more entries into the epic saga of awful proportions? I sincerely hope not.\"Police Academy 6: City Under Siege\" can best be described with one word: Horrific. I have never seen \"'Manos': The Hands of Fate,\" which I hear from reliable sources is the worst film to have ever been recorded on celluloid. But I have seen my fair share of crappy films -- especially those tasty \"MSTK3000\" treats -- and so I have a bit of background on the subject.Okay, seeing how the first two \"Police Academy\" films raked in 180 million dollars, I can see there being a third film -- perhaps. But a fourth film? No way. Yet it was made. And it flopped. And yet they still made a fifth film (which also flopped). They should never have proceeded to shove this mess into production. Six \"Police Academy\" films? No thank you.Steve Guttenberg has left, Bobcat Goldthwait has left, and so have a few other minor actors -- but the main cast remains (and they will until the end of the series). If you haven't been able to tell by now, I'm running out of things to say in my reviews that I have not covered in previous ones. And so I will continue to ramble on pointlessly until an idea strikes me as clever.The city is under siege! Who cares? The executives, of course! A metropolitan crimewave hits the city of our bumbling cadets, and so Moses Hightower (Bubba Smith), Eugene Tackleberry (David Graf), Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow), and Laverne Hooks (Marion Ramsey) are called into action to find the jewel burglar and bring him to justice! Chaos and pratfalls proceed! Laughs proceed with caution and stumble, just like the cops in the movie, along the way! So, in conclusion, this is an absolutely laugh-free movie! Why am I typing in exclamation? You tell me!Peter Bonerz directed this movie. Bonerz is a veteran of slapstick television -- so was Jerry Paris (\"Police Academy 2\" and \"3\"), and so it makes me curious: Do executives at Warner Bros. not understand that there is a difference between TV and feature films? Stupid little pratfalls and loud, noisy Looney-Tune-type sound effects do not make a very good theatrical film. This is like a cartoon transformed into some sort of horrible cartoon-film hybrid. It is evident that Bonerz, like the rest of the directors from this series, has a sense of what makes a funny half-hour television show, but he is lacking the feel for cinematic comedy.There is a big difference. Warner Bros. needs to realize this. For the most part, \"Police Academy 6\" (and all the films, for that matter) involve stupid banana-peel jokes. I've heard and seen funnier things from kindergarteners. And that's pretty sad.\"Police Academy 6: City Under Siege\" is not funny at all, and to be brutally honest, that's all there is to know.0/5 stars. Turkey.John Ulmer",

            "content": "Like the last movie, Police Academy 6 starts out with Harris and Proctor on some ridiculous mission to outsmart the rest of the crew and ensure that they get all of the glory for something or other. At least this time they're not breaking and entering like they were in the last movie, but have stationed them on a stake-out at a location that they are sure is going to be the next hit for the dreaded Wilson Heights Gang who, if nothing else, should definitely find someone else to come up with a threatening name so they'll sound more like a group of hardcore criminals and less like a gated community. But in other news, Harris is in charge of his own precinct now, Tackleberry's got a son, and some old characters like Mrs. Feldman and Fackler are back. I have to admit that I am still confused by feelings of reminiscence for Mahoney, not the least reason for which is that, believe it or not, this is the first genuinely stupid entry in the entire series. Yeah, they're slapstick comedies, but my god, how many decades have people been splitting their sides watching slapstick comedies? You could argue that the slapstick was the first real narrative story-telling that came along in film, and the Police Academies are no different, they just haven't stood up to the test of time so well.Oh, and they're also hampered by stupid-ass sequels like this one and the next one. And hopefully not part 8 which, at this point, remains theoretical.So what's going on this time? We have another small group of mind-bogglingly stupid bad guys, which is not a bad thing in itself, but apparently someone took my words too seriously when I originally reviewed Police Academy 5 and said that the movies are essentially kid's movies, because in this installment we get a cartoonish villain that is a bizarre combination of the Wizard of Oz and Dr. Claw from Inspector Gadget. I guess I should be more careful what I say when I review movies.On the other hand, the first time I ever reviewed Police Academy 5 was about 22 minutes ago, so there is some legitimacy to the theory that it couldn't have affected the thought patterns of screenwriters Neal Israel and Pat Proft, who wrote Police Academy 6 back in the late 80's. But you never know. But get this, here's the supervillain's scheme \u2013 he plans to use his henchmen to raise the crime rate in a certain strategic location in order to drive down property values, then he'll buy up all the property himself, see that the crime rate goes back down and the property values up, and then live like a king off the interest or whatever for the rest of his life. Actually, when you think about it, that's not the dumbest plot pattern. In fact, compared to how moronic the rest of the movie is, it's not that bad. At least they didn't have a villain who tried to outdo even the most outlandish 007 villains and like, you know, hold the sun for ransom or something.Again, most of the original cast is back, but I still miss Mahoney and Zed, and the screenwriters (yeah, it took more than one to come up with this thing) unfortunately have no idea what to do with the characters that we've come to know and love laughing at. Everyone is undercover and their ridiculous assignments are supposed to generate automatic laughs from us, but worst of all, some of the scenes are such disassociated skits from the plot that the story as a whole falls apart. For example. in one attempt to get into a public place and question the public about the whereabouts of the criminals and whatnot, Jones, Calahan and Hooks go into a bar, where Jones puts on a show for all the barflies doing a brilliant impression of Jimi Hendrix to the delight of the crowd and then they leave without having learned or even trying to learn anything. But at least it's in keeping with the rest of the movie, which is the first tremendous step down into the depths of idiocy in the entire series. If you thought any of the previous movies were stupid, MAN you're gonna love this one! But I do have to say that, like part 5, there are some moments in this one that I distinctly remember loving to death when I was about ten years old, like the scene where the huge bad guy who looks like a lumberjack comes outside with an ice-cream cone with like eight scoops of ice cream stacked up on it and goes, \"Oh BOY!\" but then takes one lick, pushing it off where it lands with an audible splat on the pavement and he goes, \"Crapola!\"Okay, so it's not funny in writing. Sue me. But show me a ten year old kid who doesn't laugh at that and I'll show you a kid with some developmental problems that far exceed any of the time-wasting nonsense in this movie. By the way, as I mentioned in my review of part 5, make sure to watch the little reminiscent documentary that you'll find on the DVD, it might be funnier than anything in the whole movie! Check this out, besides glorifying the movie like it's some overlooked Oscar winner, director Peter Bonerz (my god, can you imagine having THAT name in junior high school?) lists off the numerous references and homaaaaaages that can be found within its pristine contents, including everything from Orson Welles to Hitchcock himself!Sadly, your brain has to be securely in the \"off\" position in order to enjoy the movie, but it may add to the comedy just to know that some effort was put in to put those references in there!!",

            "content": "Frachises of all walks rarely remain good for a sixth episode. This is regardless of whether they are action, horror, science fiction, or even drama. On the other hand, they rarely get this bad, either. There is one moment in which Bubba Smith makes a computer give him the information by pounding his fist upon the VDT. Surprisingly enough, this is not the most idiotic moment in the film, although it does come close. Another question that constantly springs to mind is where, in the midst of a power grid sabotage, Michael Winslow gets the power to amplify his microphones.As the trivia entry states, this was the last time the characters of Hooks, Hightower, Proctor, and Fackler were seen in this series. They don't mention that it was also the last time Nick Lassard, or Mahoney Lite as he is better known, disgraced the series. It has long been said that he is little more than a pathetic attempt to compensate for the absence of Steve Guttenberg, but his performance is one of the smaller problems in this case.The real problem here is that we've seen this all at least five times before. As I've said in my comments about the third episode, Police Academy works best when it is actually set in an academy. In this case, the action begins in a district of the city where Captain Harris has been assigned far, far away from Commandant Lassard and his merry crew. One would think that a Captain in this situation would work like a dog in order to keep this situation intact. But as he and Proctor are working their old, stale routine, a threesome of robbers manage to steal an undisclosed amount/item right out from under them. This is enough to make one wonder how this man got to be a police lieutennant in the first place.In the end, the main problem is that this installment offers absolutely nothing new compared to previous installments of the series. Winslow makes his noises, Graf does his gun-nut routine, Bailey does his pathetic little momma's-boy thing, Hightower stands there looking big, and Matt McCoy tries to pretend he's Steve Guttenberg. You know a Police Academy film is plumbing a rotten depth when the biggest laughs come from the acts of the criminals, who are on-screen for a total of maybe twenty minutes.All told, I gave Police Academy 6: City Under Siege a one out of ten. I'm still debating with myself whether this, rather than episode seven, is the worst of the series. The acting, story, and humour of both films are utter tripe, but at least number seven tried to be slightly different from its predecessors.",

It isn't great and will never be a favourite comedy or overall film of mine, but it clearly knew what it wanted to be so it was easy to take it for what it was and what it set out to do.It was followed by six sequels, and none of them were as good or even on the same level as the first, though admittedly some are worse than others. Most of them are actually being pretty bad or worse and lose what was enjoyable about the original in the first place. While it was with the fourth film where things properly got particularly stale, it was from the fifth film where finding redeeming qualities proved to be difficult.'Police Academy 6' is one of the series' worst, with very little to recommend and almost completely laughter-free. It is just saved from unsalvageable doom by Michael Winslow, Bubba Smith and George Gaynes giving their all, with the best moments provided with Winslow's admittedly one-joke but wry-smile-worthy imitations and noises and the best line being Hightower's wonderfully apt line about bad jokes being where he drew the line.The rest of the acting really isn't good, with the rest of the regulars struggling to bring any freshness to basically one-joke and ridiculously lame-brained characters or having very little to do (especially Leslie Easterbrook and Marion Ramsey reduced to just looking alluring, while GW Bailey is pretty much wasted this time). Matt McCoy is a hopelessly bland and unbearably wooden lead, couldn't have been a worse substitute for Steve Guttenberg. The villain is neither fun or threatening (as bad as the fifth film was, Rene Auberjonois actually at least livened things up if only a little) and Kenneth Mars is basically a cartoon.Bigger letdowns are the writing and story. There is in 'Police Academy 6' some truly infantile writing, that swaps genuine hilarity, wit and cleverness for mean-spirit, low-brow smut and juvenile vulgarity. It was the case in the previous sequels too, but not to this extent and they still raised a couple of chuckles, something that this film completely struggled, in all but maybe two times (and even with them the series has been much funnier), to do. The characters are one-joke ones with the joke stretched to not just staleness but breaking point, and are so bumbling and dumb it insults the intelligence. This is even when you know what to expect.Story wise, the series just gets lazier with each sequel. The premise was stale by the fourth film but now it is a case of an increasingly thin and repetitive premise stretched to breaking point.There is no energy, the film is ineptly directed, the music is forgettable at best and even with trying to include a few noir-ish elements the whole film looks cheap.Overall, even more of a mess than the previous film. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

The main story, about a gang rampaging a certain part of town, is not exactly rocket science but it also isn't the dumbest, either. The film is aimed at a younger audience, but adults should enjoy the numerous jokes, especially Harris' overbearing scenes, Jones' sound effects, and Tackleberry's use of firearms and his obvious joy in driving Bigfoot during the awesome chase scene.While maybe the not greatest comedy, if you are looking for some simple fun, I'd say Police Academy 6 is a very good and entertaining film.

As such the plot is the usual collection of simple pratfalls and antics with the slightest plot about catching criminals that few will care about (and more fool those that do). The material drearily goes over old territory but the few fans the film series have will enjoy it and indeed it did draw the very occasional chuckle from me. However I was in a forgiving mood and even I didn't get more than that from it.e of the cast have anything approaching ambition or drive. They seem happy to be sitting in their cartoon characters for all these movies! Gaynes is as dopey as ever but I like that. Graf is dead now and it's sad to think this is his legacy. I have seen him in other films and he's OK when he's not just shouting and firing comedy guns. Winslow needs to get a new act \u0096 does anyone find 'the human sound effect' funny anymore? Easterbrook is blonde with large breasts \u0096 and that's all the film needs her to do. Schlatter makes a weak lead man and is real poor.Overall then a pretty poor comedy that just does what all the other films do without any real effort or imagination.

Our heroes don't go on trips anymore, they don't have romantic subplots that go nowhere. They just solve crimes, and are comically bad at it. I even wanted to know who the leak was, the plot is more compelling than usual. Especially Harris and Proctor deliver some good laughs in this one, the bus scenes are pretty funny.

Basically a string of robberies are being carried out on the same street by the same three crooks, and obviously it is the Police Academy bunch led by Commandant Lassard (George Gaynes) to find them and the connection of these robberies.

Robertson as Police Commissioner Hurst, Brian Seeman as Flash, Darwyn Swalve as Ox, Home Alone's Billie Bird as Mrs. Stanwyck, Arthur Batanides as Mr. Kirkland, Beans Morocco as Bank President and Daniel Ben Wilson as Tackleberry Jr. As with the other previous films, Winslow seems to be the only funny thing with his self-made sound effects, including a quick Donald Duck impression, beat boxing and of course the robot imitation, although Smith and Graf also get their moments, and Bailey gets more pranks played on him than the previous films. As for the rest of the film, pointless and pretty boring, and unfortunately, the last to feature all continuing actors (besides Steve Guttenburg) together, the next (and hopefully last) sequel, celebrating the 10th anniversary of the first film, only featured five of them. Poor!",

It is analytical in it's approach to two sections of modern society on opposing sides and the eternal struggle between them. Director Peter Bonerz goes straight for the jugular in his approach to individuals battling authority,( eg: Hightower breaking the leg on Harris' chair.)However, this battle must also be fought with the demoralised underclass, who have taken to grand theft. These villains are not stereotypical. Peter Bonerz infuses their character with dynamic and spectacular character abilities. Somersaulting bank raids are the order of the day here. Most interesting, however, is the neo- classical manner in which the films villain is unmasked,echoes of nineteenth century pantomime abound. On the whole, a rewarding experience for those of us who have had their fill of unfunny comedy productions.",

Three guys, considered a \"gang\", somehow manage to take over some underground tunnels, and strike out on this bus route. They also somehow manage to get dynamite enough to obliterate a power plant. Three men. And they also manage to fend off police for the hours you watch this movie in utterly boring fashion.The humor was bad. Bad enough that I just sat there throughout the movie just staring at the screen. No laughs. No giggles. Just looking at the screen. Wasn't this movie a comedy? The jokes were all bad, and the actors really didn't care. I mean, anything from the police officers rapping to a super-strong guy making a bad joke about \"Boo who\", this movie's jokes are really sub-par.Just, don't watch it. Many movies should just be avoided - unless you're looking for a night of pure boredom, this movie isn't for you.",

Naturally, he then turns to his most trusted police officers who have helped him out on so many missions before. Unfortunately, \"Captain Harris\" (G. W. Bailey)--who happens to be in charge of the precinct where most of these crimes are occurring--doesn't especially like the fact that an outsider like Commissioner Lassard has taken over. That being said, Captain Harris therefore has no intention of cooperating unless absolutely forced to do so. Yet, while Commissioner Lassard may have no idea of how troublesome Captain Harris can be, those officers loyal to the Commissioner understand only too well and fully realize that they will have two challenges facing them-the crooks and some in their own department. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film pretty much reused the same old gags of the previous 5 movies in the series with the only exception being that a couple of them had slightly more depth. For example, one specific scene involving \"Officer Jones\" (Michael Winslow) doing an imitation of Jimi Hendrix was especially humorous. Even so, the fact of the matter is that this particular film still wasn't quite as good as the first two movies in the series and for that reason I have rated it as slightly below average.",

Maybe it's because it was released around the same time as that movie, or Burton had a spare set going.Other than that, watching this movie through rose tinted glasses doesn't do the film any good. The first time I saw this film, I was 12, and I liked it, largely because Police Academy had been shoved down my throat, thanks to the yearly sequels.Seeing it now, you realise how poor the actual film is, and that the screenwriters couldn't come up with an original idea between them.It's all the same stuff. Hightower shows his strength and has one scene where he looks frustrated.Jones makes lots of noises and does bad Kung Fu.Hooks shouts.Tackleberry has a big gun.Callahan shows her guns.Harris and Proctor get things wrong.It's what we get, time and time again, and it gets less and less funnier.",

The cast is the same familiar faces and the jokes are about the same too. Here though they are trying to stop a crime wave involving these guys who map everything out and leave very little evidence. There is a head guy who is behind it all and who he is adds a bit of mystery, but not much this is a comedy after all not a crime mystery movie. In the end Hightower has to fight someone just as strong as he is, Takleberry must face down someone as good with guns as he is, and Michael Winslow's character must take down someone as good in karate as he is. After this movie they would thankfully take a break from making these movies, and it looked like it had finally ended until Mission to Moscow would come out.

I saw The 'Burbs 1st, followed by this 6th installment of Police Academy and finishing with Rain Man. (That last one, sadly, was sold out, so this punk and his friends probably took other people's seats who actually paid for the movie. Sue me, I was 15. I guess if I was a celebrity now, this might ruin my career EVEN if I apologize and track down the owners of the long since demolished Valley West Mall 6 Discount Theatres and pay them the $1 I stole. Okay...I'll see what I can do. And...sorry. I will never steal a dollar's worth of movies at the theatre again.

Literally to tell that story and to see what I thought of it, for only the 2nd time in 30 years.

In fact, I don't think I've seen a Police Academy movie since the 80s. Maybe that helped.Maybe seeing a Part 6 to a series 3-decades separated from the whole franchise helped my unbelievable enjoyment tonight. No joke; from about 4-5 minutes in, I was laughing my ass off...all the way through the climax. I really did have a good time here.Maybe it was also because I didn't have the hang-ups of comparing it to the previous installments and I could remember each character's personality and talents. I believe it's also because, sometimes, it's just nice to see a Rated PG slapstick comedy for all ages. After so many adult comedies - that I DO enjoy a ton and so many borderline PG-13 ones that really should be R's, it's nice to actually see a really funny farce that anyone can enjoy.True, the movie's not perfect or even close. But, the cast is active and present. And all of my laughter was genuine.Watch this again and I might not have the same reaction. I probably was just in the right frame of mind, tonight.

            "content": "The \"Police Academy\" franchise is increasingly showing signs of wear and tear. After a film far weaker than any of its predecessors, I had hoped that attempts had been made to improve things a little. However, this film is at least as weak as its immediate predecessor. However, that doesn't mean it's a bad movie, quite the opposite. There are much worse and much better rated films out there, and the comedy of this film is quite friendly and familiar, unlike what happens in many other comic films, where the humor is pure and simply dirty. This is an enjoyable movie and sometimes even has some fun... it's just not as good as its predecessors.The script is based on a series of attempts to stop a group of bandits from carrying out a series of crimes and robberies in a certain area of the city. Obviously, Lassard and Harris will be together to do it, and Harris is only concerned with his own career progression and continues to be the preferred target of the cop trolls we already know. The script is not brilliant, but it manages to support the film in the way it was conceived and executed. It turns out that the quality level is now very low, and this can also be seen in the poverty of the dialogues, in the amount of clich\u00e9s and situations that, instead of making us laugh, make us wonder to what extent the screenwriter was a competent person.The cast does what they can with what they've been given, but they don't have the space or material to stand out anyway. Bubba Smith assumes an unquestionable protagonism, but he doesn't have a character or even material that makes him stand out more. Michael Winslow does what he can, but he doesn't stand out much either. Easterbrook and Ramsey are a shadow of what they were in other films. Matt McCoy is no joke and shouldn't be here. Villains can be more idiotic and childish than the Looney Tunes and George Gaynes, as respectable as he is, turned his character into an old man with no memory or sense of the ridiculous. Who is still standing out in some way is G. W. Bailey, but this happens mainly because of the ridiculous situations in which he ends up involved.Technically, there isn't much to say about this film. It seeks to maintain the characteristics and visual aspect of its predecessors, with standard cinematography, conventional editing and few notable effects, in addition to the shots and some interesting situations, such as the one in which Tackleberry writes with his machine gun. Everything else is simply more of the same and doesn't deserve a specific mention.",

This was a long time member in the worst 100 movies list on IMDb if I remember correctly. However I say this movie has also some good ideas and some nice scenes but not redeeming enough. It is again in the realm that I see the potential of the ideas, set up and script. It could be done or redone in a way that would be a good experience. I say it lacks the heart and soul of the better movies in the franchise. To clarify this: They miss the humor and quirks. All movies in the franchise were cheesy and silly to a content but it was the good kind that was enjoyable, humorous and relatable for the better ones. Here it is more like a ticking off things from a to do list without having the insight why / how these worked. As another example: The movies did often rerun on TV and do you know were it mostly ended? After Police Academy 5. This and the next (also last) sequel were barely shown. The story starts with Captain Harris who has left the academy and is in charge of the police in a city district. His district is overrun by a crime wave caused by the Wilson Heights Gang and this makes him and the higher officials look incompetent. The Governor had the idea to hire external help for him to solve the issue. Guess who the support team is that is also Captain Harris nightmare ;-). This is what I mean with potential. It is a good set up and a lot could be done with it. Sadly the story can not deliver. It never reaches the immersion and enjoyment that I was truly invested. The things I liked was the plan of the bad guys, the antagonists and a shocking moment at the end. Like I said it has a lot of unused or wasted potential. Lets go to the characters. I think they were also trapped in the roles. I wont blame them as it is still good money. The Police Academy cast was so iconic in the earlier days and I still like them here but it is not that good, refreshing or enjoyable anymore. Matt McCoy as Nick Lassard was forced into the Carey Mahoney role. He should be his own character as he is missing the mixture of genuine character and scoundrel of Steve Guttenbergs role. I still like all the characters like Bubba Smith (Moses Hightower), Michael Winslow (Larvell Jones), Leslie Easterbrock (Debbie Callahan), David Graf (Eugene Tackleberry), Marion Jones (Laverne Hooks), G. W. Bailey (Thaddeus Harris) and Lance Kinsey (Karl Proctor) to name a few. I often heard the argument that characters outlived their welcome and I say this is the movie were I grasped the meaning. Without nostalgia and the other movies I would maybe even criticize them. Overall I recommend ending at Police Academy 5 and skipping this and the next movie. It is not enjoyable nor worth remembering. As fan however I watched even the next one which is the end of the franchise and the weakest entry.",
