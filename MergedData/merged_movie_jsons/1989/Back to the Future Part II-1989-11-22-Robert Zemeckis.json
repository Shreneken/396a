            "content": "Back to the Future Part II (1989) was green lighted after the success of the first film. The film follows the further adventures of Marty and Doc Brown. This film and the third installment were filmed back to back. However the complexity of the storyline turned off many of the fans of the original. But this is what I enjoyed about this movie. Instead of being the same old run-of-the-mill by the numbers sequel, the film makers decided to do something different and make this a brain twister film. The beauty of this movie is that you have to pay close attention to it.The film takes place right after the events of part one. Doc Brown comes back from the future to help Marty get his kid out of trouble. Instead of leaving well enough alone, all three of them head off to the future to try and change events. They managed to pull it off but unfortunately they tore a fabric in time due to Marty being greedy and the nosy efforts of Doc Brown. Can Doc and Marty safely restore the space and time continuum before the universe collapses upon itself?A fun sequel with a few cast changes (Elizabeth Shue now portrays Marty's girlfriend whilst Crispin Glover is no longer with in the film except in stock footage). Most of the original players return to reprise their original roles. Michael J. Fox stretches his acting abilities by playing his son and daughter as well as his older self. If you enjoyed the first film then you'll really want to watch this one (if you haven't already).Highly recommended.",

            "content": "Marty McFly is back, and this time he has to travel back to 1955 after an unfortunate incident which took place in 2015 so that he can prevent the destruction of the peaceful society of Hill Valley (what a great fictional name!). The film provides two hours of absolutely wonderful and fun entertainment. Every paradox and logical problem of time-travel is explained very well in the film itself, and those that are left out are easily overlooked due to the creativeness of the rest of the film. Who cares that if Marty leaves 1985 in a time machine to 2015, there would be no Marty left in 1985 to grow to up into the 47 year old Marty in 2015? This movie is so much fun that things like this are gladly forgotten about in order to accept the huge amount of satisfaction delivered by the film. The Back To The Future trilogy is a perfect example of the need to be willing to abandon at least a tiny bit of logic in order to fully enjoy a movie. This suspension of disbelief is necessary for a person to be able to truly experience the effectiveness of all three Back To The Future films, and this experience truly is a great one. It is so rare that a film or a series of films comes along that is so well written and perfectly acted and directed as the Back To The Future movies are. Although I realize that another sequel would probably be disastrous to the credibility of the series as a whole, I have to admit that I have always been disappointed that they stopped at the third film. All three are so much fun that they leave you wishing that the story left room for a few more sequels.",

            "content": "Back to the Future Part II is an solid sequel to the first one which Back to the Future (1985) is a masterpiece. This is a fun travel science fiction comedy in the trilogy. It deals with paradox past traveling. From traveling with Time machine Car \"DeLorean\" in to the future and back to the past again. This film is a 8 in my opinion it doesn't deserve the hate, like mostly viewers stated. I love \"Back to the Future\" trilogy it is one of my all time favorite trilogy's of all time. I grew up with this trilogy I have seen the first one on VHS as a kid. Years later I have seen the sequels on TV. I love this movie to death and it is my third favorite film in the trilogy. Don't get me wrong but I have enjoyed Back to the Future Part III more than part II and think the third film is the most underrated film in the trilogy and unappreciated. This film does have the comedy and the humor in it.I Love, Love this film so so so much, it is a great direction from Robert Zemeckis and brilliant writing from Bob Gale. Back to the Future Part II was nominated for an Oscar. I really did missed 21st October 2015 an important event date from this film in the trilogy that reached 30 year anniversary in the year 2015 when the trilogy come out respectfully on a Blu-ray. Back to the Future Part II (1989)The story continues when Doctor Emmett Brown, Marty McFly and Jennifer traveling in to the future 2015 to fix Marty's and Jennifer's future in which Marty has to save his son from been jailed. His arch enemy Biff Tannen steals Marty's idea and steal's Gray's Sports Almanac only to travel back in to the past November 12, 1955 to change the alternative time line paradox in which Biff creates the timeline in the year 1985. The same alternative timeline and paradox was also used in The Flash Season 3 Episode 1 Flashpoint. Than the story sets Marty and Doc on the hunt for a Gray's Sports almanac from Biff in the year 1955 in which Biff is a teenager. The chase and a race on the road in which Marty is in Biff's car try's to get the Almanac back and Biff crashes with his car in the truck of manure is my favorite scene in the film. The Hoverboard scene in the future in which Griff chases Marty in the year 2015 and Marty outsmart them in which Griff and his gang lands in the court in the opening scene is also my favorite scene in the film.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are excellent in their performances. Michael J. Fox plays more than just one character, he even played Marlene McFly future daughter of Marty.Things I really didn't like about the film and that is why it hurts the film: the dark future created I didn't liked. I hated Thomas F. Wilson's character Biff trough in tier film he was irritating awful person. I didn't like the death of George McFly. I didn't like Biff marrying Loraine. Half of the film was more focusing on Biff than Doc and Marty I hated that idea. I did not like the filmmakers repeat the first movie again in the year 1955. They copied the first film I did not like that idea so sorry. I still hate Biff Tannen in this movie so damn much! I did not like the ending in which Doc was hit by a lightning with \"DeLorean\" and sent back 100 year in the past. The film didn't had a satisfying ending or a happy ending that we wished for. I didn't like older Marty McFly he acted like he is stupid in the movie that is why I prefer III over this film more. Claudia Wells and Crispin Glover did not return to reprise their roles. I am surprised that actress Elisabeth Shue accept the role of Jennifer but she declined the role for The Karate Kid Part II weird. This film get's 8 \"Back to the Future\" is my favorite trilogy of all time and I love this movie to death. I hope they don't make Part IV because it will be disaster. It is rated PG for language throughout, some suggestive content and violence. I miss movies like this they don't make em' like this anymore.",

But anyways, I just saw the Back to the Future trilogy tonite and after it seeming like I was the only person who didn't see these movies, I did it! Part two was a very good sequel, while it isn't quite up to par with the first Back to the Future, it was cool, it was kinda like Deja Vu with a different story that worked.Marty and Jennifer start off where the first left off, Doc takes them to the year 2015(which is funny that it is only 8 years away), and Doc tells Marty to fix a situation with his future son. Biff overhears an idea later brought up to Doc about possibly giving himself tips to win big money for the future as soon as they go back, but Doc talks him out of it, but Biff has different plans and takes the book and the De Lauren and goes back to 1955 and makes himself the richest man alive in 1985, so Marty and The Doc must go back and alter the future back to it's old ways.Part two is definitely worth a look for those Back to the Future fans, not to mention, it's just good to see where these stories go. Like I said, it's not as good as the first, but it is a good movie and actually a little better than a 7.1, if you ask me. But that's just me, so just give this movie a chance, you just might find yourself enjoying it.9/10",

            "content": "Continuing a movie as perfect as \"Back To The Future\" must have been a really tough job. What made it even harder was that the writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale had to ignore an important character from part one. Because Crispin Glover asked for too much money, his character George McFly, Marty's wacky Dad, hardly appears in the sequels, which constricted the storyline a lot beforehand.Still, \"Back To The Future II\" turned out to be a huge success, commercially and artistically. The movie is every bit as clever and delightful as part one. I think most viewers don't realize how extremely complex this story is, because it's so enjoyable to watch. Gale & Zemeckis wrote a screenplay that takes place in three different periods of time, changes storyline more than once, has characters interacting with themselves all the time, but never seems overdone or confusing. The most original trick the two Bobs pulled was to virtually return to part one and have the main character interfere with the original storyline. I don't think that has ever been done before or since.No, the movie isn't flawless in a sense that everything can be explained logically. Bob Gale admitted himself that Marty and Doc shouldn't be able to visit their future selves in the first place. There are a lot of impossible time travels in part two (you can read about them in detail here: http://mjyoung.net/time/back2.html). \"Mistakes\" like that don't take away any of the fun, though, and I still think that the \"Back To The Future\" trilogy incorporates the logics of time traveling better than any other movie ever did.Besides the perfect script the trilogy's success is due to Zemeckis ever so beautiful direction and his eye for detail, and of course the great cast. Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Thomas F. Wilson and Lea Thompson, all shamelessly underrated actors, are once again brilliant. It's a REAL pity that Crispin Glover didn't return for the sequels, but as I've said before, Gale & Zemeckis did a great job writing their way around his memorable character. The only other actress that didn't come back was Claudia Wells, who played Jennifer in part one and was appropriately replaced by Elisabeth Shue here.Summing up, \"Back To The Future II\" is a more than worthy follow-up to one of the best movies of all time. In fact, I think it's the best sequel ever made, only rivaled by \"Terminator 2: Judgement Day\". But that's a different story...",

            "content": "'Back to the Future Part II' takes off where the first movie left. Pretty much the essence of the first one is present except this time Elisabeth Shue has been cast as Marty's girlfriend. Like the first movie, this one too is non-stop fun. The original plot once again, brilliantly revolves around the time-travelling paradox but this time the interference with the time-line has huger repercussions that are more complicated to solve. It's slightly a little more complex than the first movie but the energy and entertainment level is the same. I liked Zemeckis's version of 2015. It has that ultracool look and the futuristic gadgets and gizmos were quite amusing. The soundtrack is equally wild. The camera-work and special effects are very well done considering that the challenge was greater (e.g. showing two Michael J. Fox on the same screen). Okay, so showing the same actor share the screen with himself isn't anything new but in most movies/shows it looks poorly done which is not the case here. With most movies, the sequel tends to be a let down but 'Back to the Future Part II' is a great continuation of the first film.",

            "content": "It's funny that the plot of 'Back to the Future II' should be based on altering Marty McFly's future. Wasn't Doc the one who was so staunchly opposed to knowing too much about their future, preferring instead to let things take a natural course? 'Destiny!' he called it. But that is exactly what the sequel is all about, Doc's proposal to altar the future. And this leads not only to bad news for Doc Brown and Marty, but for the your Density? I mean, Destiny? (flashback humor).The story focuses on Marty McFly's future. Picking up right where we left off in the first movie, Doc informs Marty that in the year 2015, Marty's son partakes in some unfortunate activities with Griff (Biff's grandson) that lead to his arrest and incarceration. While in the future to fix up that little mishap (again, messing with 'Destiny'), Marty picks up a sports Almanac to take back with him. The Almanac contains all sports scores since something like 1955 (why it is only the size of a magazine, I don't know, considering it covers major college and pro sporting event for a whole lot of years). The Doc, in disgust at Marty's foolish get-rich-quick desires, throws the magazine out (while still in 2015). Unfortunately, Biff, now an old man, gets hold of both the magazine and the Delorian and travels to his young self in 1955. This sets off a change of events in the past so that when Marty and the Doc, now in the future, are ready to go back to 1985, suddenly find themselves in an unfamiliar hell. With Biff changing the past, he also changed the future, creating a desolate, alternate 1985. One where Biff is the richest man in Hill Valley, though still the sleaziest. And where a lot of other things have changed as well. Now, Marty and the Doc have to go back to 1955 and get the magazine from Biff if they expect to restore the future and erase the alternative 1985.This is a great sequel to a great movie. You get the 1989 version of the future (I don't know that 2015 will make the kind of progress we see in the movie with cool flying cars and dehydrating pizzas and hoverboards). This is the special effects and visual beauty of the second, whereas in the first one, it was recreating the past. Marty had to once adapt to 1955, now he has to do the same for 2015, even if only for a moment. But, it also ties in another creative aspect: when Marty and the Doc must return to 1955, they only know the whereabouts of Biff based on where they last saw him in that year--the school dance and all of that which took place in the first movie. Going back to that past means that a Marty \"Calvin Klein\" McFly is already there, and the events are taking place again just as we saw them in the first movie. And now, the Marty and the Doc from the future are intermingling once again with their past versions of themselves. So, in essence, the filmmakers had to recreate some of the scenes from the old movie, from different angles, and the actors had to play dual roles (which they do often throughout the trilogy) by being added into those scenes. It was a great special effects/visionary project to undertake, and what makes the series so damned creative and really a fun idea. And here, too, the goal is to avoid running into your past self because, yes, it could altar events once again. I wonder how the future changed since Marty and Doc's intervention in 2015? So, prepare yourself for what may arguably be the best movie out of the trilogy (probably because you get to see the future and past and everything in between; although, I'm still torn between rating the first or the second as my absolute favorite). It is the continuation of a fun first movie, and keeps up the creativity and novelty. I think that was the reason most responsible for its success: the ability to keep offering something new (although some things, are obviously repeated, like the running gag of Marty blacking out and waking up to some version of his mother informing him of what year it is after he tells her what an awful dream he had).So, sit back and let the Delorean be your guide.",

            "content": "When Back to The Future was initially conceived, director and writer Robert Zemeckis and writer Bob Gale had no idea how much notoriety it would eventually achieve, nor of the big box office records it would break.  They were happy just to see their project come to fruition. When they wrote the original film, the ending they had written was supposed to be the end of it. Because of it's success, however, and Hollywood being Hollywood, there had to be the inevitable sequels.  The problem was that with the original ending, they had painted themselves into a corner as to where they could go with the sequel.  What they finally came up with in Part II, is a film that is every bit as whimsical as the original, yet moves along at a pace that will leave you breathless. For part II the cast is pretty much intact from the original film.  The exceptions are Crispin Glover as George McFly has been replaced by Jeffrey Weisman and Claudia Wells has been replaced by Elizabeth Shue as Marty's girlfriend Jennifer.  George McFly's role in the sequel is more talked about by other characters than his actual on screen time, and Jennifer's time on screen is quick and brief also (although she has one great scene that takes place in the future)so neither casting change is of any consequence. The original film dealt with how Marty had threatened his own existence because of changes he had accidentally initiated in the year 1955.  For Part II, we learn what happens when the interference is of a much larger scale and consequence. As you recall, the original film ended with Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd)whisking Marty (Michael J. Fox)and Jennifer away with him to the year 2015 to straighten out their kids.  For all his harping about messing with historical events, Doc is not above initiating a bit of interference himself.  In their attempt to rescue Marty's future offspring, an aged but still obnoxious Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), steals the Delorean to transport himself into the past and to bestow upon himself a Sports Almanac book that contains the results of sporting events for years to come.  Shortly thereafter, Doc and Marty return to 1985, only to find that not only is Hill Valley not what it used to be, their own lives are in pretty sad shape and far different than what they had been before.  And the changes aren't good ones, or as Doc puts it \"I can't imagine Hell being much worse.\" What makes the Back To The Future series so terrific, is that Zemeckis and Gale took the time travel concept, applied a little originality to it, then let their imaginations run wild. In BTTFII, we get a story that moves along like a runaway freight train.  Not content to give us what the year 2015 may be truly like, since making such predictions are usually wrong anyway, they decide to let it all hang loose and just have fun with it.  There are holographic theaters, Cafe 80's shops, antique stores that sell dustbusters and other things, skateboards that hover, paying for cab rides with thumbprints, etc. etc.  Yet, for all the glossy, multi-colored stores and goofy concepts, we still recognize it as the same old Hill Valley. Something else Zemeckis and Gale do is to take some events from the first film, and replay them in 2015 Hill Valley.  Usually, things like this would be seen as the lack of an idea, but in this case its simply Zemeckis having a little fun and letting us in on it.  It works perfectly. Likewise, the alternative version of 1985 Hill Valley is an exercise in how far one's imagination can go.  Instead of a quaint peaceful town and suburbs, Zemeckis and Gale do everything in their power to give us the equivalent of an opposite. To go into too much detail here would undermine your own viewing experience and give away a bit too much of the plot. Then to add fuel to the fire, we once again revisit Hill Valley in 1955, where things really go berserk what with two Marty's and two Docs inhabiting the same year.  Zemeckis does a great job of cutting new scenes into footage from the original film with different angles and different perspectives of previous seen activities. As for the cast, Fox and Lloyd keep their characters of Marty and Doc on the same entertaining level as before.  Fox is also given the chore of playing his nerdy son of the future, Marty as a middle aged man and even his daughter of the future.  He is pretty much successful except I do think playing his daughter was a bit much.  Lea Thompson, again has the difficult chore of bringing Lorraine Mcfly to us in three different characterizations, and as before handles it admirably.  Her 1955 Lorraine will always be her most memorable characterization in these films, but the others are equally well done.  As for Thomas F. Wilson as Biff, Biff is biff, no matter how old, how young, or how powerful he may be, and his consistence of performance is also noteworthy. Some have complained about being able to follow Zemeckis and Gale's storyline.  If you have seen the first film, you'll have no trouble in that regard.  I sure didn't, and for me it was one heck of a comedic thrill ride from beginning to end.  If you don't have fun watching Back To The Part II, then the only thing I can think of is that your as much of a curmudgeon as old Biff from 2015.  It's not often that a sequel can live up to it's predecessor, but when it does, and introduces some originality along the way you get my grade, which for Back To The Future is an A.",

While he's about to relax with his girlfriend, Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue), Doc Emmet Brown (Christopher Lloyd) comes back from 2015 with his DeLorean time machine and asks Marty to go back to the future to save his children. While doing their job, Marty buys a sports almanac of the 20th century and unfortunately, when Doc seriously asks him to throw it away, Biff (Thomas F Wilson), a long-time nemesis, overhears their conversation, takes the book from the waste bin, steals the time machine and gives the almanac to his younger self back in 1955.When Doc and Marty get back to 1985, they realise that things have changed. Hill Valley has turned into hell, governed by the wealthy, powerful and devilish Biff Tannen. Marty's father has long been dead and his mother is married to Biff. What went wrong? Finally Doc and Marty find out that they must revisit 1955 and get things right...This fascinating sequel has some fun and some dark sides in it. The skate boarding scene is just brilliant. What a deja vu. The 2015 presented in the film is quite interesting (I wonder if 2015 will look just like that) and we get to watch once again Marty playing 'Johnny B Goode' and his father punching Biff. In the end, after getting back in 1985, Marty unintentionally changes his own future for better again. Most sequels are pathetic, but this one is different. It succeeds in exciting the audience. The whole cast did a good job, Michael J Fox is great fun playing several characters at the same time. Along with the original and 'Back to the Future Part III', this is for certain one of the best time travel flicks. Not to be missed!",

The sequel is a bit more interested in it's sci-fi elements, and a little less interested in people.But the real problem is that this movie is much less well constructed than the original. In BTTF, everything is neatly set up. Everything that happens flows logically from a previous event. But BTTF2 is much more of a mishmosh, with a rambling story and loose threads. Even the way the movie begins is antithetical to the first one. The first time around, Doc is keenly aware of the dangers of fooling with history; in this movie, he chooses to change things around.It's also also just not nearly as funny as the first one.BTTF2 picks up towards the end. The last half hour or so has Marty returning to the scenes of the original movie, and it's cute to see the way he has to change events without letting the first time traveling Marty see him. It is in fact references to the first movie that are the best part of the second. Which just proves how good the first one was, and how idea- poor the sequel is.",

I personally like the 50's stuff in it, but I am also a huge 80's fan (the present in the movie) and the future is just hilarious. Of course...it has been almost two decades since this movie came out, and now we know that the future that is shown in BTTF 2 is a bit funny, but hey...do you remember Total Recall? Now THAT is also a future that would never see daylight, but at least the BTTF 2 future is amusing.I have seen this movie over a dozen times, and I tried to find things that don't match, movie mistakes etc. (yes..I am a pain in the ..)but the thing is, I KNOW that there are mistakes (like reflections in window glass) but this movie keeps your mind drifting away, enchanted by the great story and great moments. Of course Spielberg never intended to have more ingredients then the past (50's), the present and the future. But almost 20 years later...it is also a (another) great movie to see what the 80's were all about. (so another great moment for people of my age, born in the late 70's)I recommend this movie to ANYONE, but watch BTTF(the first movie) first, because you can't watch part 2 or 3 without watching it in the right sequence.Have fun!

So its up to Doc and Marty to stop Biff for letting this all happening as they try to fix time. The year is finally 2015, and the 2015 we have today is nothing like what the movie looked. Of course, I have look up many news and videos as they try to create shoes that laces themselves, and creating hover-boards that float. No the Cubs did not win the World Series, but we came so close to make that predictability a reality. So anyway, \"Back to the Future Part II\" is a fun sequel to watch, but not as good as the first. I thought Michael J. Fox, and Christopher Lloyd are still great together, while Lea Thompson and the rest of the cast all did great. Of course, I have to mention Thomas F. Wilson who is really good for playing a bad guy like the character he played in all three movies. The look of 2015 is really well done, which it doesn't go into the same style like what \"Blade Runner\" looked. The movie does have its exciting moments, and you are always rooting for Marty and Doc as they try to save time. The special effects by ILM are really good, while some seem slightly dated. The movie is also funny too, so nothing much that I can say about. Alan Silvestri's music is also really good too along side with the story. I do wish if the opening scene wasn't re-shot, but Claudia Wells was unable to due to what is happening with her family; its understandable but can't complain about that. However, I do wish if Crispin Glover was in this movie but he ends up not to due to what his reasons were as he needed more money, and not appreciating how the first one ended. I do disagree with his thoughts on the ending, and I still wish if he was in this movie. So with that said, I enjoy \"Back to Future Part II,\" and I am sure that you will have a fun time with this one. I give this movie a 9 out of 10.",

It's only in the final third, when they go back to 1955, that the film comes to life for an exciting finale.Zemeckis drowns the film in special effects, has some sort of compulsion to have all the characters meet their other selves and really stretches every bit of credibility to the point of absurdity (the tunnel scene not only unsuspenseful and unconvincing but badly edited). The film somehow feels rushed, not made with a whole lot of passion, even the cast somehow seem disinterested. Thomas F. Wilson however gives another great performance in no less than three roles and is by far the best of the bunch this time around.Back to the Future Part II is not boring, but in comparison to the first rate original it comes as a sore disappointment.

This guy was so annoying, he ruined the story for me. They even had him (the same actor, too) playing his son \"Griff\" in the future. Thanks to him, this BTTF Part 2 had a mean edge to it. I wanted an adventure-comedy, not a nasty movie. There was too much emphasis on this villain instead of the lighthearted fantasy that made the first movie such a hit.

Time travel movies generally play havoc with my brain but this one seemed to do a pretty clever job with the time jumps back and forth. That probably had a lot to do with Doctor Brown's (Christopher Lloyd) analysis of a temporal junction point for the whole space time continuum. I did manage to catch a goof in the story after Marty (Michael J. Fox) retrieved the sports almanac out of the trash can in Strickland's office. It had the almanac cover wrapped around a girlie mag, but later on when Marty grabbed the book from the unconscious Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), the entire book was intact.

This time things would get much darker as Marty and the Doc travel to the future and do things that have serious repercussions in the present so they have to go back to the past to set things right... it sounds confusing but makes sense when you watch it.The film starts just before the end of the previous film so we see Marty, the Doc and Jennifer take off for the future, this time however we see that Biff has witnessed their departure. Once in the future Marty must intervene to prevent his son from getting involved with a robbery being planned by Biff's grandson. Things might have gone well if that was all that he did however he has an idea to make a bit of money on his return by taking a book of future sports results back with him. Doc tells him to destroy the book but he leaves it it the DeLorean. Having overheard this conversation Biff steals the car while they are picking up Jennifer and returns it before they notice it had gone.When they return home to 1985 everything has changed, the town of more like a war zone, somebody else is living in Marty's house and Biff is a millionaire living in a casino with Marty's mother. Marty confronts him and finds out that Biff had been given the future sports book by somebody claiming to be a relative back in 1955, using the results inside he had amassed a fortune. The only way to set things right is to go back to 1955 once more and retrieve the book before Biff can use it.I enjoyed the darker tone of this film although some of the special effects in the future scenes looked a bit ropey by today's standards they didn't detract too much. The film is full of references to the original, in the future we have a hover-board chase around the town square similar to the skateboard chase in the original and when he is back in 1955 we see several scenes from the original film but from a different angle often with both versions of Marty in the same frame. Michael J, Fox and Christopher Lloyd were great once more in the leading roles and Thomas F. Wilson did a good job as Biff and his grandson Griff.

            "content": "\"Back to the Future 2\" is at least as engaging, entertaining and compelling as its predecessor, and that's already a praiseworthy accomplishment when dealing with sequels and/or second installments of a trilogy. Part two is perhaps slightly less regarded as a cinema classic than the 1985 original, but that's merely just because the surprise element has gone and because all the characters already feel familiar, as the screenplay is equally solid and eventful \u0096 arguably even more so. The story lines here are admittedly more hectic and convoluted, but returning director Robert Zemeckis and writer Bob Gale never at one point lose their grip on the story that is literally stuffed with paradoxes, time loops, inside-jokes, subtle references to prequel and sequel, clever hidden trivia and accurate time details. The first film merely just featured one major journey through time, but the splendid DeLorean time machine sets off no less than three times now. Barely returned and recovered from his first time-traveling adventure, Marty as well as his girlfriend Jennifer get picked up by Doc Brown to prevent something from happening in the year 2015, before it tragically affects Marty's private family life. Everything goes more or less according to plan, except for the aging Biff Tannen \u0096 the McFly family eternal nemesis \u0096 borrowing the DeLorean and traveling back to 1955 to hand over an almanac with sports results to his younger self and give instructions on how to make easy millions. With the alternate 1985 being a hellish wasteland to return to, Doc and Marty have to go back to 1955 as well and prevent young Biff discovering the truth about the almanac he received from old Biff. Meanwhile, they have to pay close attention in order not to interfere with their other selves who're there to fulfill the mission narrated in part one. It's honestly far more complex to give a brief description of the synopsis than to actually watch the film, because then the whole story simply seems to unfold automatically. All the different and hugely diverse themes neatly merge together, as if the screenplay wrote itself! There are some mild changes in comparison with the original film \u0096 released four years earlier \u0085what a long waiting period that must have been for the impatient fans \u0096 like the absence of Crispin Glover as Marty's dad and Elizabeth Shue taking over the role of his girlfriend (and apparently future wife), but generally speaking the most vital aspects and cast members remained. The humor is still incredibly effective and the action sequences are impressively staged and performed, notably the final showdown between Biff and Marty in the tunnel. Obviously the story lines are more absurd, the plot twists more grotesque and the use of special effects more plentiful, but basically this still remains a Hollywood sequel and they simply have to be bigger, louder and extra spectacular. At least here it's never at the expense of ingenuity.",

            "content": "Warning: unpopular opinion alert. Having just watched the sequel to the brilliantly energetic Back to the Future for the first time, whilst having a moment of reflection as I imagine myself riding a hoverboard with a pair of Nike MAGs equipped, I arrived at my conclusive destination. No time travelling back and forth between alternate timelines needed. And as much as you probably do not want to hear this, honesty is the best policy. With that, I can confidently confess that Back to the Future Part II is aggressively average. A sequel riddled in so much mediocrity, that I'm dumbfounded as to how it has received such unanimous praise from audiences. Immediately after the events from its predecessor, Doc and Marty travel to the future to prevent his son from sabotaging their family's future.However in doing so, future Biff uses Doc's time machine for his own devious benefit and timelines become more skewed than Glover's non-existent involvement (glad he won the lawsuit). Gale returns as the primary writer, and in the short space of time between this sequel and the original, he had seemingly forgotten how to write a decent character driven plot. The story is solely focused on the mechanisms of time travel, by dabbling into several different points in time, that Gale outwardly throws in as many paradoxical plot points as possible. The present, the future, the past, an alternate present. So much story was crammed into the plot, that he had inadvertently relinquished the heartwarming emotional family drama that made the original tantalisingly refreshing.Literally, take the first hour of this film and use it as fusion energy. It's a complete re-hash. Copying the same events from 1955 and adapting them to futuristic technologies found in this now awkward dystopian 2015 (if only we had flying cars...), may generate callback humour. But consequently makes the entire set piece monotonously dull. Zip back to 1955, adjacent to the previous film's timeline, and again it's just an identical narrative structure. This time substituting the emotional core resonance between Marty's mother and father for a simplistic yet elongated chase sequence for a sports almanac. This would be all swell if Zemeckis could actually focus on one sub-plot at a time. The constant shifting between present Marty chasing Biff whilst avoiding past Marty and past parents, Doc floating around aimlessly in the DeLorean and Jennifer...wait, what even happened to her? Talk about discarding the one and only female character almost immediately!Essentially, the pacing was diabolically uneven. The only hint of originality was with the alternate present timeline and that whole sequence was instantly forgettable. Had it been more emotionally impactful on Marty, then perhaps I would think differently. Unfortunately he shrugs it off and consistently yells \"Doc!\" whenever he has a minute not chasing someone.Atleast Gale remedied my existing criticism with the first film by giving Biff some much needed character development. His antagonistic motives actually provided sufficient fuel for Doc and Marty. Lloyd offered another perfect performance as Doc, and Fox was slightly more underwhelming than his previous iteration, but that's down to the robotic script which provided more opportunities for visual spectacle. And yes, the visuals still hold up well today (minus Glover not Glover floating upside down...). But to waste a total of five minutes by replicating the ending to the original (shot-for-shot) and spewing a teaser trailer for Part III, was futile.In all seriousness, I'm shrouded in disappointment. From all the \"woops\" and \"cheers\" that this trilogy has received over time, I would've anticipated a solid sequel. Alas, the uneven overstuffed plot slowed the pace down to a staggeringly moderate 30mph, not nearly enough motivation for me to travel back in time and watch this again in a hurry.",

Although it has been a while since I've seen the first two Back To The Future Movies, from as early as I can remember, I always favored Part II. Although much of this favoritism has to do with its overly futuristic depiction of 2015, I still find myself to be drawn to the sequel that introduced more comedy, character development, and most importantly, built upon the framework established in the first movie. Then of course there's the classic hover-board scene, which to this day still amazes me. Above all, the biggest reason why I continue to be amazed by Back To The Future II is because of the nostalgia it evokes from viewers both young and old. We are in that time frame where both parents and their children are familiar with the Back To the Future movies, and it just amazes me to think that it was only 30 years ago that my parents were heading to the movies to see Back To The Future, and were around the same age as I am know. It was only 30 years ago when they envisioned a world filled with flying cars, even wackier clothes, and HOVER-BOARDS. Now I am growing up in that time frame that they always dreamed about, and I am experiencing technology that at one time seemed like science fiction to them.

Because I personally do love it when a sequel is a direct continuation of the previous movie. And \"Back to the Future Part II\" does so efficiently and quite well.The is a lot more time traveling going on in this sequel, compared to the first movie - for better or worse. Was it beneficial to the movie, certainly, because it was needed to tell the story and it was needed to set the plot and story.The future segment was funny, although set in 2015 with a way, way, way more futuristic vision of how time actually panned out. Sure, that was campy and entertaining to see. And for some reason then director Robert Zemeckis included a lot of plastic accessories for guys to wear in the future - reminiscent of the glorious 1980s, but made to look strange and futuristic. And the \"Jaws 19\" jab just cracks me up every time.Then Marty and Doc return to 1985, but to an alternate timeline with massive changes done to the history. This segment was funny as well and equally detailed. This is where the drama was amped up and took over the storyline.The best part of \"Back to the Future Part II\" is when Marty and Doc return to 1955. That segment was pure genius. I loved how director Robert Zemeckis incorporated the events from the first movie and then had the characters interact with the environment of the 1955 era and try not to interfere with Marty and Doc from that first movie. It worked so well, and it was a pure joy to watch that on the screen. And this segment is really the heart and spirit of the movie.The storyline was quite good, and it was well tied together given the different timeline jumps and interactions with the events of the first movie. I must admit that I have always been adequately entertained by the story in this sequel.As in the previous movie, they had assembled the cast once again, which included Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson and Elisabeth Shue. And also included Billy Zane, Jason Scott Lee and a very young Elijah Wood.While \"Back to the Future Part II\" is not fully up to par with the original \"Back to the Future\" movie, then it is a strong addition to the franchise and is a definite must watch if you enjoyed the first movie. However, like this first movie, then this sequel is a movie that you also can watch again and again.",

And it is pretty darn complicated. We now have parallel worlds, overlapping times, actors playing multiple characters, actors playing the same characters at different ages, characters changing the lines of themselves in earlier states, the time machine coming and going past itself in ways that only make sense if you are tied to the narrative this one way. We also have scenes and tropes from the first movie repeated in slightly different form. The way of tracking whether the future changes is by photos and newspapers that change as their past is manipulated.

            "content": "I am conflicted on this one. Naturally, it is the sequel to the most popular film of nineteen eighty-five, and one of my favorite films of all time, Back to the Future. They did not expect the film to become a hit, but when it did, the studio took no time telling them to make a sequel. And so we got this film. The creators have gone on record stating that the 'To Be Continued' at the end of movie one was not supposed to relate to anything, and that if they knew that they were going to be making a sequel, they would have ended it differently.The lack of desire to make this movie in particular shows. A lot. It is disjointed, filled with plot holes, pandering, and altogether does not work as a film that can be enjoyed completely seriously. I do like this film, but I like it in the same way that I like another ridiculous sequel to one of my favorite films of all time: Rocky IV. Both films are memorable and ingrained in the public consciousness, but decidedly not what a film critic would consider good.But why? What goes wrong here. Let's take a look at the plot. Marty McFly, the seventeen year-old icon of the 80s himself, goes with his girlfriend Jennifer (played by a different actress and sorely underused in this film) and crazy but awesome (seriously, the man made a time machine) scientist, Doc Brown to the future. What's the year, you may ask if you were living under a rock about a month and a half ago. 2015.I could go into how this movie's description of 2015 compares with the real 2015, but I went into that specifically on a post on my website that I wrote on BTTF Day. Suffice it to say that it is pretty cool in the retro future kind of way, the same way that steampunk and cyberpunk is cool. This is, strangely enough, the weakest section of the movie by far. There are some funny gags, but everything else falls flat.The second third takes us to an alternate 1985. I won't spoil anything (though if you haven't seen this film... shame on you), but suffice it to say that things are not pretty. It lacks the grand dystopian vision of something like Blade Runner, but there is a texture to the atmosphere that I really appreciate. And... I prefer to not get too political, but can we all just agree that the terrifying Alt1985 Biff is Donald Trump.The last third takes us back to 1955. This is both the worse and the best part of the movie. There are a lot of rehash gags here, and it comes dangerously close to completely retreading the plot of movie 1, and it drags on way too long, but the tension is thicker than in any other part, and the last fifteen minutes of the film is one of, if not the best sections of any of these films.There are a lot of parts that are just lame, plain and simple. But I don't feel embarrassment but disappointment. Of all the movies, this one covers the most ground, has the most ambition and imagination, and overall material to make a great film. But whereas the first one did everything right, this film squanders a lot of opportunities. The magic is gone. I wish I could say that it's a great film, but it's just an average one, and my least favorite of the BTTF trilogy.(Still, it is pretty cool how they were able to throw in a couple references to BTTF 3 due to shooting both sequels at the same time.)",

Alan Silvestri's score is just great, gives an emotional touch like not many scores do.Now, a little problem comes to the fx. instead of using models like in star wars (what also made star wars win Oscars for the effects) they started using CG, just CG technology wasn't yet so perfectioned in 80s-90s like nowadays. That's a little problem though, the movie's not overloaded with these FX at all. Of course you will laugh at the depiction of 2015 in the second chapter.",

The center theme of the script is the time line conitinuum. If broken, the result could be disastrous. 3 parts of the film I notice is that Michael J Fox wears the same clothes, uses the same expressions etc because it is the 1985 Marty. Genetics and history repeats itself is another inside joke in all three films. A polarity with time travel theme. As history repeats itself the same people do the same things, but a little differently. Biff, is the usually unhappy jerk, who is selfish, and believes everyone owes him. If Biff is not happy, then no one is. This movie is a great set up for what will happen in the third. One can watch ones self, but not interfere, and at the same time learn via the third person.

This time there is more time traveling going on back and forth in order to fix the future when the main villain gets a hold of the time machine. This does have clever moments, especially how it connects with the first movie during certain scenarios which is the main highlight of this flick. However it seems to count on mostly the first \"Back to the Future\" scenarios and the different things that Marty has to do while the story in the first movie is taking place. And that is very cleverly incorporated into this movie, however it would have been better if it had other clever moments that stood out. And maybe it would have been cool to see Marty, his girlfriend and Einstein the dog working together in order to accomplish something would have been great if it was like I said cleverly incorporated into this sequel. But it just seemed like Marty's girlfriend was just there to pass out after seeing her future self. She does play a part in the third installment, but only so very slightly. When it comes to the plot this is the heaviest of the three and a lot more things are going on, however the simple aspects with although typical and yet well engraved gags, punches and larger than life direction made the first installment just more memorable. Don't get me wrong, this is still a really good sequel though. With a heavier sequel such as this especially dealing with time travel, it's difficult to not make any contradictions which this movie has some noticeable ones if you pay close attention to it. What I also found out is how Claudia Wells from the first one got replaced by Elisabeth Shue. I noticed something was different, but I just thought it was because of aging. Anyways although this is my least favorite of the three for me, it's still a compatible sequel to the trilogy. Just do not watch this without seeing the first one or it really does lose it's effect.8.2/10",

            "content": "This sequel to the family-orientated sci-fi smash of 1985 is probably just as much fun as the first film, with an even more complex plot and a more frenzied approach to the narrative. The first half hour is a little weak, but once the major plot twist arrives the story begins proper and gets really good. The film also has a large amount of humour and slapstick-style comedy to appeal to the kids, and Christopher Lloyd's eyeball-rolling performance as the mad scientist is arresting for sure.On the plus side, this film does some very inspired things with its time-travelling plot and is one of the most complex I've seen - the film takes place variously in the future, in the past, in the present and in a couple of alternate realities just to bamboozle you. You have to concentrate throughout at the risk of getting really confused by the whole thing, but if you stick with it you'll find it to be rewarding. Another plus are the special effects of levitating \"hoverboards\" and flying cars which haven't dated at all and are still impressive to this day, and plentiful too - every penny of the budget is up on screen somewhere.There are lots of action sequences which are always entertaining, and Michael J Fox is endearing as the lead and I'm still surprised that this is the same guy who played the chubby weakling only seven years previously in CLASS OF 1984. The second sequel was shot back-to-back and released a year later, but the law of diminishing returns resulted in a film far less enjoyable than the first two in the series. I particularly like that most of the narrative in this one is comprised of a simple chase to capture a crucial book, which eases away all of the background complexity in favour of simple, crowd-pleasing entertainment.",

            "content": "Power up the DeLorean, turn the time circuits on and get the flux capacitor! Where we're going, we don't need roads. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, and written by Bob Gale; 'Back to the Future Part 2' has everything to make this time travel trip, really fun to watch. However, its mediocre excuse of a monomyth journey feels a bit less intense than the first movie. In my opinion, trying to save yourself, from disappearing, seem like, a bigger conflict, than trying to save your children from jail time. Adding this lame reason for them, to travel in time, once again, seem, like the studios wanting the creators to capitalizing on the once stand-alone film, even if they didn't want to. Honestly, did, Doc Emmet Brown (Christopher Lloyd) really need to take Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and his girlfriend, Jennifer Parker (Elizabeth Shue) to the future, in an attempt to save his identical son from trouble? It seems like it would be, more troublesome, than helpful, because if Marty and Jennifer disappear, even temporarily from 1985, then events in the future would change until they return. As such, the future Marty and Jennifer shouldn't be there, and nor should their Michael J Fox-alike offspring. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, most of their most pivotal story has clearly been done in the first movie. So, there wasn't much to work with, to launch this new adventure. However, the series a complications involving a sports almanac is by far, the best part of the film, but also the most stressful to understand. It's time-travel paradoxes like these that make the film, so-so confusing, compare to the first movie's story. Trying to understand the logical of all the time travel plot-holes, surrounding this, would take you out of the movie, and give you a headache. It's not worth it. Trust me. However, it's so thought-provoking in its science, that it's fun to debate, all the mind-blowing actions, later on. Just, not, when you're watching the movie, for the first time. Filmed back-to-back with its sequel, 1990's 'Back to the Future Part III'. The movie visuals effects are breath-taking. I love, how the film's version of 2015, looks like, something like World Fair 'visions of the future', exhibit. It has the right amount of 1980s nostalgia cheese mixed with Sci-Fiction elements to make it, fun to look at. On the other hand, the Hill Valley of alternative 1985 with its punk-rock dystopia look, wasn't much, different from the Hill Valley of the 1985. Maybe, more work, could had been done to make it, look so much wore-down. I do like, how the movie recall 1955, back into the plot as well. It's nice to see, the characters trying to avoid, their previous selves. For the most part, all the actors that return from the first movie, were great in their roles. Still, it's really hard to take, some of the actors, seriously, when they playing multi-roles. Honestly, are we supposed to believe that Michael J. Fox is also playing Marty's future daughter!? Come on! That's stretching the uncanny gene pool too much. Still, I like the chemistry between Michael J. Fox & Christopher Lloyd in this. Both show, this father/son relationship that I love from these films. Thomas F. Wilson as Biff Tannen is amazing. He's one of my favorite villains of all-time. I like that Lea Thompson is back in this, but I wish, she had more to do, then wear- old make up. However, two actors from the first film, Crispin Glover and Claudia Wells, did not return. Claudia Wells didn't return as Jennifer, due to family issues. Glover didn't return, due to conflicts with the studios and the creators. His character, George McFly, was not only minimized in the plot, but was obscured and recreated with another actor. Another actors worth checking out in the film, are Elijah Woods, Flea, Jason Scott Lee, and Billy Zane. So look out for them. One thing that bother some people about this film is the Hoverboard hoax. Zemeckis once said that the hoverboards were real, yet not released to the public, due to parental complaints regarding safety. A number of people thought Zemeckis was telling the truth and requested them at toy stores at the time. While, as of this writing, hoverboards has yet to be invented. It's still, possible for it to come, within the next 10 years. Other aspects of the depiction of the future had not come to pass by 2015, but efforts were made to replicate the technology advances such as flying cars, and self-typing shoes. However, the film did correctly predict a number of technological and sociological changes that occurred by 2015, including: the rise of ubiquitous cameras; unmanned drones for mundane tasks; flat panel, widescreen television sets mounted on walls with multiple channel viewing; video chat systems; hands-free video game systems; wearable technology; and head-mounted displays. Anyways, still synchronize your watches! If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88mph, you're gonna see some serious s***. While, this movie had great action scenes. The movie isn't my favorite, when it comes to that. The ending was a bit, anti-climax. However, one thing, I wish, the movie didn't show, at the first showings are previews of Back to the Future Part 3, coming soon at theaters. Thanks for no spoiler warning, Robert Zemeckis. Still, there is one thing that people can agree on, is the music by Alan Silvestri. It's emotional, epic and intense music. While, it's a recall music from the 1st movie. I do love, the little bits, they add, to make it sound new. I like how this movie create an animated series, theme park ride, several video games and a forthcoming musical. Overall: Back to the Future 2, has stood the test of time. It's worth your time watching!",

            "content": "Sequels are seldom better made than their predecessors, and even though this is clearly the case with this movie, I still thought it was a good follow up to the wildly successful first one. Back to the Future Part 2 seems to know that the first movie was better, which is why the later sections of the film revisit scenes from the first movie. Conversely, it also adds some interesting plot elements of its own, including a sad (but also sweet) ending. The story picks up where the first film left off. Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) and his girlfriend Jennifer are trying to get on with their lives after Marty successfully managed to get his parents to marry and thus cause his birth. Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) shows up in the DeLorean and tells Marty he must travel into the future with him (2015 to be precise) because Marty's future children are the bullying victims of Biff Tannen's future children. Upon arriving in 2015, Marty reads about how his son is being sent to prison because of a robbery, but he is able to reverse this by impersonating his son and refusing to assist Biff's grandson. Sometime later, Marty buys a sports catalogue that contains the outcomes of every single sporting event from 1950 to 2000. Little do Doc and Marty realize, Biff himself, who has been harassing Marty since the first film, is in 2015 (at least an elderly version of him). He is able to steal Marty's sports catalogue, hijack the DeLorean, and give the book to his past self. By the time Doc and Marty manage to get back to present day 1985, they discover a horrible looking place. Biff is now one of the world's richest men, and has amassed something of a Donald Trump reputation. He has a tower dedicated to himself, enjoys making public appearances, and has a huge legion of undying fans. To top it all off, Biff is now married to Marty's mother. Marty is taken hostage inside Biff's tower and tries to find out how his former bully made such a success of his life, and during a private meeting, Biff reveals it was the sports catalogue that produced his never ending luck. After the old Biff gave the magazine to himself in 1955, he was able to correctly predict the results of baseball games, football matches, horse races, etc. All this turned him into a millionaire basically overnight. Marty also finds more bad news when he discovers that in this alternate timeline, his real father (George) is dead, and was killed by Biff himself in the early 70s. Doc Brown tries to come up with a theory and settles on this explanation: at an unknown point in the past, Biff became rich, famous and corrupt, but this timeline can't be undone by travelling into the future, as that would just bring Marty and Doc to the future of this nightmarish world. In order to fix everything, Marty needs to locate the exact date Biff got ahold of that book. After Marty's meeting with Biff earlier, in which he told him he got the book the same 1955 day where Marty came back to the present in the first film, him and Doc arrive in the 50s once again. Marty shadows an adolescent Biff on his way to the school dance, where Marty's parents met in the first movie, and sees the old, time traveling Biff give his younger self the catalogue. Marty then hides in Biff's car, but getting the book proves way easier said than done. It is eventually confiscated by school staff, and by the time Marty gets ahold of it, he finds to his horror that Biff replaced the actual book with something else and all Marty has is the cover. As Marty returns to the dancing area (just in time to see his younger self play Johnny B Goode), he has to make sure his clone doesn't see him, or else the future can be changed drastically. He sneaks by unnoticed, but Biff beats Marty and then drives off in his car with the book. After much frustration and physical abuse, Marty, with Doc and the DeLorean's assistance, manage to snatch the magazine from Biff's car. As Doc and Marty prepare to time travel back into (the normal) 1985, the DeLorean gets struck by lightning and disappears. Marty is left behind. It finally looks like after everything he's been through, it was all for nothing. As he starts to panic, a messenger shows up and gives him a letter that was apparently written all the way back in 1885. It's from Doc, and he explains how he is doing well and knows Marty will eventually come back for him. As is usually the case with movies involving time travel, this one is pretty confusing. It's already hectic enough that Doc Brown was teleported into the past at the end, because Marty is able to run to where Doc just sent the younger Marty back to 1955 at the end of the first film, and sees a duplicate of him standing there. I thought the plot was mostly a mess, and had too many things going on at the same time to be coherent. It's not explained very well how Biff knew how to operate the DeLorean, and somehow, nobody in the past noticed he was using a magazine to predict all the sports winners and call him out on it. Even though 2015 is already in the past for us, the film makers were really optimistic about how it would look. The movie's special effects really bring this year to life, as flying cars are shown streaming everywhere, as well as having retro diners dedicated to the 1980s. Don't even get me started on the self-lacing shoes future Nike has made. To summarize, this second installation in the Back to Future series isn't bad, but it's quite flawed. There's really too many things to pay attention to, and the later parts of the movie are essentially recycled scenes from the first film. This is another example of a movie that was wise enough to not take itself seriously, because if it did, the plot would just be mediocre. The movie is decent, but not a worthy successor to its forerunner.",

            "content": "Back to the Future Part II is a terrific sequel - it may not be the best ever made, but its certainly a novel approach and a great deal of fun. There's a lot going on in this film as we visit three time periods - future, alternate present and past again - and as a result its hard to pin down a single story like in the first or third films. The future storyline struggles to find purpose given Doc's repeated insistence that the future must not be meddled with. That being said its essential for the movie and its so much fun to watch 2015, both as a prediction over the last 30 years and as a bit of humour from now on. Its startling how accurate some things are - Skype, 3D films - while others are a great source of humour. I never realised until this watching that both Marty's son AND daughter are played by Fox. Production design does a great job being funny whilst also conceivable, but the film's makeup is absolutely appalling. If you're going to make Lea Thompson put on that stupid voice and cake her under 100 feet of makeup, just get a different actress. Michael J. Fox as future Marty looks like Bride of Chucky. A man comes up to Marty to ask to save the clock tower and he's clearly caked in makeup, but why? He's no recognisable character after all, they could've just got any old man. Thomas Wilson plays the utterly unbearable Griff, who feels the need to shriek every word like a mental werewolf android. Not a whole lot goes on here and we quickly get out so that the film can set up the dystopian alternate reality.In alternate 1985, Biff has stolen the DeLorean and made himself rich. This is the best plot line that Gale could ever have come up with, because who among us hasn't wished we could do that? Rick Carter and his team create a twisted and brilliant dystopian 1985, and Thomas F. Wilson is exceptional as the evil billionaire Biff. Doc quickly figures out what happened and explains to the audience in a way that is not overly expository because thanks to Lloyd's consistently wacky performance, it is actually a fun scene to watch. Finally we get back to 1955 where the film plays out. Marty and Doc need to get back everything while not tampering with the past AND avoiding their selves from the first movie. This is by far the best part of this movie. Zemeckis blows my mind when constructing scenes that have two Michael J. Foxs noticeably on screen, because it doesn't for a moment look like they've done it with cheap effects. Zemeckis creates an aura of crises by constantly throwing obstacles into Marty's way, so you'll watch Marty's quest for the Almanac on the edge of your seat. The film finishes with one of the most famous cliffhangers and utterly delightful conclusions I've ever seen. Michael J. Fox is older and a bit less enthusiastic about being this wacky kid again, but Marty is such a lovable character that it doesn't matter too much. I always get cheap entertainment out of the whole \"are you chicken\" thing with McFly that was introduced in this film, but objectively its stupid. Lloyd is just as good as in the first film, every bit the wacky mad scientist in his voice, demeanour and even posture. Elisabeth Shue is irrelevant as Jennifer, who is included in the film because Gale and Zemeckis made the mistake of taking her with them at the end of the first, but Thomas F. Wilson is delightful as the various Biffs throughout time. Not many people could play a character as a teen, a tycoon and an old codger with equal conviction.Back to the Future 2 has lots of omages to classic scenes in the first, but none of them feel forced or tacky - there's something delightful about watching Marty flee on a hoverboard instead of a skateboard. Its a great and worthy sequel and a heap of fun to watch.",

Fox doing a mediocre job at playing Marty McFly's entire family a-la Eddie Murphy (not a pleasant comparison, I know). On the other hand, the scenes in the alternative 1985 are wonderfully dark and edgy compared to the first film, and all the scenes in 1955 - especially the ones made to correspond to parallel ones from the original - are brilliant. The unsatisfying ending doesn't help the fact the it feels a bit like a tweener, but it still stands as one of the most solid sequels ever made, and holds the first and third movies together well.",

Everyone was crying out of a sequel and the team of Zemeckis/Gale made two sequels back to back.However with Crispin Glover refusing to return as George McFly meant that the story for the BTTF II had to be drastically altered. They went in a complete different direction with just excerpts of Glover used from the original film as well as a double.BTTF II also replaces Marty's girlfriend with Elizabeth Shue and her role has been drastically reduced.BTTF ended with Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) taking Marty (Michael J Fox) and Jennifer to the future to sort out his kids. This time where they were going they did not need roads.Marty and the crew arrive in 21 October 2015. The day this review was written. At the time I saw this film in the cinema 2015 sure felt like a long time away and you really felt that there would be hover-boards and 3D holographic films. I guess Avatar was the nearest we got to it.Although Marty sorts out his offspring's future it also allows Biff Tannen to steal the DeLorean and a sports almanac and drastically change the time-line to a darker one. Marty and Doc have to go back to the 1955 and the setting for the original film to restore the original time-line.BTTF II is a fast paced film as it squeezes the plots of three movies in its running time. However by going for a darker alternative time-line some of the charm of the original film was lost which was largely maintained in the future scenes set in 2015. As Fox remarked when the film came out , they wanted the future to be largely optimistic.My biggest issue always was that sports almanac with all the results of sporting events going back 50 years was an awfully thin book. Was it a prototype Kindle?Fox and Lloyd have no problems reprising their roles and very much carry on from the original film. The only odd change of character being that Marty gets upset when someone calls him chicken when he refuses a challenge.Fox has fun playing multiple characters in the film, Lea Thompson also plays her character in different time-lines and Thomas F Wilson is nasty Biff whichever time-line he is in.The film is a rollicking good adventure and a sequel that is almost shoulder to shoulder with the original. Zemeckis and Gale went on a different direction than many people expected. This is no lazy cash grab sequel. Its a time travel adventure that stands on its own self lacing Nikes and stupendously finishes with the set up to a third film.However the film does miss Crispin Glover's offbeat George McFly. I felt this at the time I saw the movie in the cinema and my opinion has not changed 26 years later.",

            "review_title": "Almost As Good As the Original...Extremely Underrated...",
            "content": "Let us recall the cliffhanger of an ending from the original `Back to the Future.' It is 1985. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is back from 1955. His girlfriend Jennifer (played by Elizabeth Shue this time around) and him are admiring his newfound truck. That's when Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) came back to 1985 in a hovering Delorean and brought Marty and Jennifer into the future with him. This is where the audience comes back into the film, in the year 2015. And let me tell you, Doc and Marty have really got their hands full this time\u0085 `Back to the Future Part II' did something that not many sequels do. Because of this, it is one of the best sequels ever made. Let me explain.In a lot of movies the directors and writers complain about how the movie would have been better, but they had to make a movie that `people who didn't see the first film would understand.' Let me say something in regard to these pitiful statements. It's the fault of the people if they didn't see the original film and decided to watch the sequel anyway. Why watch a sequel if you haven't seen the first?! I guess a lot of people do\u0085  Well, `Back to the Future Part II' was made for the people who saw the first. You just simply can't follow the storyline if you haven't witnessed the awesome power of the original (not `awesome' as in punk dialogue. I mean the true definition of awesome. Look the word up). I have seen people watch `Part II' who haven't seen the first before. It's almost funny watching them become so confused. I try to explain what's going on to them, but it is pointless. The movie is simply for those who have seen the first, plain and simple.Another wonderful aspect of `Back to the Future Part II' is that it broke away from the almost stereotypical `dark' look of the future. Blade Runner had a very sullen and dark look. Good for the film, yes, but I commend `Back to the Future Part II' for creating their own look for the future. Instead of grainy, dark images, we are presented with a very bright atmosphere. Objects are almost bouncing off the screen they are so bright. It is great.I also think that this sequel plays more on the whole idea of how changing things in the past effects things in the future. In fact, the original title of the film was going to be \"Paradox\" instead of \"Back to the Future Part II.\"And then there are the marvelous, confusing-to-some plot twists that really keep you thinking, but still provide enough humor and fun to create a very, very worthy sequel to the barely superior original film.I do not really understand why people do not enjoy `Back to the Future Part II.' I read some reviews, and it appears that it is mainly because so many people saw it without seeing the original. Why would they do this? Again I ask myself and achieve no answer. Go buy the trilogy on DVD. They are great films, even if the third was a little disappointing. 4.5/5 stars for `Back to the Future Part II.'John Ulmer",

Granted, this film does it better than many time films... but some of it is just silly. The big problem revolves around a sports almanac. The almanac would not be brought to the past if Marty had not been brought to the future. He did not even need to be brought at all, though. Rather than just tell Marty, \"Hey, your son is going to make a mistake on this day -- don't let him\" they travel to the future... but this allows Marty a glimpse of things to come for no good reason.By the way, this opens up the possibility of Marty still betting on the World Series in 2015... getting rich.",

(A little nod to Blade Runner, maybe?) Landing in Hill Valley of the future, Doc and Marty go about saving his son from becoming involved in a robbery attempt. Though things get complicated, the guys manage to succeed. But a very old Biff discovers their secret and goes back to some time in the past to change his own future. The movie deftly handles the parallels in the timeline. In this one, we get: 2015, 1985, 1985 A, and finally 1955. And it's in '55 that the film really takes off. Because it just so happens to be the same night that Marty goes back to 1985. So both Marty and Doc have to be careful about running into their other selves. But then... Just watch it, you won't be disappointed! While some think that the movie's too bleak, I think it shows the dark side of time travel and what happens when technology is used for evil or selfish purposes. The ending leaves you hanging and eagerly anticipating Part III. As a side note, I'd like to also warn both Universal Studios and Mattel: October 21st, 2015 is coming around quickly, guys.

There's some irony in seeing the character of McFly dealing with his own offspring who is a megalomaniac demigod, but like others of that character type, he is far too out of his mind to be even enjoyable to watch. Made in conjunction with the third part of the series, it gave hopes that the writer and director learn something from the flaws of this and created ideas that would work better and certainly not repeated in their future endeavors.",

Generally speaking all movies have quite some nice effects. Some you may notice (like the old age make up), some you may not notice that much.The chemistry between Marty and Doc is there and it is really something to behold. Their relationship is the backbone of the movie and he's at least as much a family member if not more to Marty than his actual flesh and blood are. Having said that, other relationships are more complicated and the movie gives us some hints to part 3 ... which if watched back to back can be relsihed and enjoyed even more than having to wait 6 months for the next movie to be released in cinemas.Very enjoyable and very entertaining and has not aged significantly at all",

However upon returning they see that the fabric of time has been altered and now Biff is all powerful. So Marty and Doc must find out what went wrong and correct it.This film does a good job of picking up where the last one left off, however with a different actress as Jennifer this time. A lot happens in this film and it never drags ever in the whole film which is pretty cool. It is kind of like how The Empire Strikes Back has a lot happening in it,this film has that as well.Marty and Doc both are great again. The major character who gets more development in this film is Biff, and surprisingly he is a pretty funny character. I love the part where old Biff talks with younger Biff.This film is by far the most confusing of all three of the Back to the Future films. All of the time traveling is cool, but with so much going on and people almost running into themselves from other times it makes the film very unrealistic.This film is unique in that the last third of the film takes place within the first film. I can not think of any other film that does this. So I think that it is mandatory that you see the first film before you see this one.I think this is a great sequel to the first back to the future.

Being in 2014, you can't stop yourself comparing that whether they got it right or not. Imagining that by 2015, there won't be any lawyers, justice would be served in 2 hours or so, there will be flying cars everywhere makes you think we are progressing at much lower rate than we could imagine. Marty and Doc find themselves screwing the time lines, creating alternate realities and obviously responsibly fixing the faults made. Despite sitting on a technically confusing plot, writer and director never let things go overly complicated by explaining things in simple English and keeping excellent humor alive and kicking. Peppy instrumental back ground score running almost every second enhance the drama and urgency beautifully. Despite being a sequel to a cult out of box movie, movie succeeds surprising you at many junctures and wherever screenplay crosses with the screenplay of part I, you can't stop yourself saying WOW. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Back to the Future Part II. I do not recall any other science fiction being so much funny.",

It wasn't really planned to have a sequel but I am very happy they ended up making one. My favorite movie in the whole trilogy.This movie shows Doc and Marty go to the future to stop trouble from happening and then have to go back to 1955 because their time travel caused some trouble in the present as well. I have some problems with the movie. It makes no sense to me that Doc wants to save Marty's son but not Marty from ruining his life as he did. Although for this they wouldn't need to go into the future but just prevent it when life goes on and there would be no movie. I also don't get why them meeting themselves would be such a horrible thing but universe didn't collapse by having Jennifer meet herself in the future. This could be easy to prevent by just not have Jennifer run into each other and there would be no confusion. And have them all play their own kids/grand kids was a bad idea.But those three issues are small compared to what a great movie it is so I still rate it as a 10, since things that really matter are perfect. There is so much going on and it is very action full and exciting. And have the characters go back to the past to the same day movie number 1 took place was absolutely brilliant as it creates many awesome scenes. And once again the ending is very promising, also giving us a little look into what to expect from the finale.Now, I am watching it almost in 2015, and the future scenes are pretty fun. Pretty much all those things already exist except for clothes, flying cars (almost every movie about the future has flying cars! really need to work on them if we want them so much!) and the many times promised hoverboards.

But Biff is still around and spies an opportunity for untold riches; which he takes. Meaning our three time travelling wonders have to find a way back to the past to stop Biff from changing the course of history.The gargantuan, and deserved, success of Back To The Future ensured {demanded} that a sequel would follow. So taking the bull by the horns, Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gray crafted not only a sequel, but a trilogy, of which part two is ultimately a sort of interim plot filler for the finale to come a year later. There's no doubt about it, part two is at first a puzzle box of a picture, one that had this particular viewer back in the day venturing in for multiple viewings to unravel the deft, daft, but intricate plot.I have grown to love part two very much as I have got older, with each viewing tending to reward me just a little bit more. Directed with absolute keenness by Zemeckis, the film moves at such a pace there is barely time to catch breath, something that hardly helps one to follow exactly what is going on. But it does make sense under scrutiny, and as we lurch from one magnificent set piece to another, we find a dark undercurrent of bleakness in amongst the froth.The makers offer up two visions of the future, one is all colourful and swamped in glorious 80s nostalgia, yet it's knowingly enveloped in consumerism and hi-tech reliability. The other is bitten by greed and almost under despotic control, it's food for thought and rather wry in its telling. Not content with that, the makers whisk us back to 1955 just to remind us that a time of innocence and hope did exist; and simultaneously with skill they repeat the ending of part one with the additional story of part two! Clever eh? The returning cast are again uniformly strong {Michael J. Fox, Thomas F. Wilson & Christopher Lloyd} while Elisabeth Shue confidently steps into Jennifer's shoes after Claudia Wells {Jennifer in part one} fell ill and was unable to continue the role. Alan Silvestri's score still packs a cross dimension's punch and the effects crew again come up trumps {it's ace in HD}. It now can be seen as the bridge between two better movies, that's for sure, but I liken it to Spielberg's Temple Of Doom-more darker than the more favourable films in a series; but one that is crucially still having fun. It may be a high-tempo ball of funny confusion at times, but this one, courtesy of it's ream of homages and sly observations, is one of the best trilogy sandwich fillers going.Munch it. 8/10",

Meaning there's now two pairs of them there. And we see several bits of the first in relation to this one, and it's really put together quite well. This is much more complex than the original(so if you haven't watched that one or it's been a while, refresh your memory before starting this one, or you'll be immensely confused), and it's also, a bit of the way, fanservice to it. And is anything wrong with that? If you're watching this, presumably you love that one, those are the people who wanted more, and this is one of those follow-ups that actually hold up(and in some ways, surpass their predecessor). It does have a bit of sequelitis going on, thinking that bigger is better, but most of the time, it proves itself right, because it never does go overboard. The 80's vibe is still very much present, and the humor tends to be silly(though there are definitely some clever lines and such, as well). Lloyd mugs, Fox annoys and entertains, and a lot of the acting is deliciously over the top. Biff is again the bad guy, and he is a fun foil for our hero. The FX are larger and more detailed, and the majority of the time, they look good. While no longer a high school comedy, this has the same tone of the '85 one. The climax is tense, the time travel is used well to create more plot, and the whole thing is exciting. There is some moderate to strong language in this.

            "content": "Back to the Future 2 is a brilliant sequel, for its incredible futuristic special effects made this film into a Classic Time Travel movie. There was a period, however, when the entire film went stagnant and downhill, but did pick-up again as the film went on. Up until the part when Marty McFly(Micheal J. Fox) returned to the alternate(Biff ruled) 1985 for when Marty got hit over the head by Biffs goons infront of the Clocktower/Biffs Casino Hotel this film was spectacular, but thereafter that scene, this film endlessly dragged-on.In time this film did pick-up again when Marty McFly went back in time to the year 1955 to retrieve the Sports Almanac that Old Biff gave to young Biff, for that spiced up the film again. Even though I very much enjoyed this film, I did find that there were loads of contradictions in it that didn't make sense. The scene when Old Biff travelled back in time from the year 2015 to the year 1955 to give the Sports Almanac to himself (so he can win money on horse racing by knowing the winning results ahead of time) and then returned to the year 2015 didn't quite match up. This is because when Old Biff travelled back in time to the year 1955 giving himself(Young Biff) the Sports Almanac so he could become rich, he did in fact change history. This means that when he returned to the year 2015 it should have been the new alternate(Biff ruled) 2015, but it wasn't, for it was the same normal 2015 that he departed from.Another scene is when Marty and Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd) went back home to the year 1985 after fixing Martys family problems in the year 2015, didn't make proper sense either because seeing how old Biff changed history, that prevented Marty and Doc Brown from ever meeting one another and even Doc Brown from inventing the Time machine. This doesn't match up either - for this would have caused a time travel paradox that Doc Brown often speaks about, which would have ceased their existences to time as they knew it, and their souls would have been redeemed into the new alternate(1985) existences, for Marty would have become the new Marty that lives in a boarding school in Switzerland and Doc Brown would have been redeemed into the life of the alternate existence of being committed into a mental Institution, but it didn't happen that way. Instead, there were two Doc Browns and two Marty McFlys living in the same year and from different parallel universes/ time vessels - and many other examples of contradiction that just go on and on. Mind you, this film is a Comedy/Sci-fi and seeing as time travel is a fantasy subject, a person really can't take these contradictions seriously, for this film 'Back to the Future/ Part 2'(and other time travel movies) are about enjoying yourself and having a laugh. Despite this films contradictions which aren't a big deal anyway, i'd recommend anybody to watch this movie for the acting was good, especially Thomas Wilson(Biff/Griff Tannen) who performed a fantastic acting job, the special effects/background was amazing along with its great lighting and colour co-ordination and most of all the storyline was good.

Wilson) both the old Biff guy and the young tough Biff guy but I liked the conflict that this sequel created with the tug of war(s) between the old and current Biff's and Marty McFly's. I was disappointed that Crispin Glover did not reprise his role as Marty McFly's feeble father George McFly but the writers were able to work him out of this film sequel admirably. (I understand Crispin Glover had sued Zemeckis for the illicit use of his image via a mask and he won his lawsuit?)At more than one point I will admit I lost track if Marty and Doc were in 1955 or in 1985 and which Marty McFly was real or travelling back to the future. Although the storyline was not as intriguing as the original it was more than enjoyable to want Mrs. Shullivan and I to proceed further and immediately plop in disc 3 and watch the finale film Back to the Future 3.I mean, who isn't curious what the future has in store for yourself eh?I rated this sequel an excellent 9 out of 10 rating.",

It's almost a caveat to the enjoyment of this movie that there was never supposed to be a sequel. And seeing as Gale and Zemeckis wrote themselves into a corner with the ending of Part I, what they did with this is impressive.I still love the gags during the future sequence and just the way the world is depicted. Also, a flying DeLorean is just ridiculously cool. \"Part II\" is a technical marvel; and even with its lack of resolution, this is still a very entertaining movie.9/10",

            "content": "'Back To The Future Part II (1989)' picks up from its predecessor's purposefully over-the-top cliffhanger and runs straight for the finish, weaving a complex web of potential paradoxes, suspenseful set-pieces and ahead-of-their-time special effects with nothing other than absolute aplomb. Of course, it isn't as good as the first film; nothing is (almost literally). Still, the thing is an absolutely solid sequel that's far, far better than it really has any right to be. There are two things it perhaps does better than its big brother: pacing and VFX. The story starts after mere moments and doesn't let up for a second, keeping you hooked until it reaches its own incredibly iconic cliffhanger ending. The most prominent special effect is an utterly seamless 'acting opposite yourself' sort of thing, which still puts similar efforts to shame. Though the movie is known as \"the one where they go to the future\", it doesn't really get going until it dives into a deliciously devilish alternate 1985. Here, the time-continuum conundrums really start to begin and they are an absolute blast. It's probably closer to what you think of as a time-travel narrative than the more one-off, 'what-if?' story of the first. A lot of that is because this is pretty much the pioneer of most tropes associated with the genre. It's all incredibly well-conceived. For every line of near ham-fisted fan service, the flick gracefully pulls off a beautiful bit of foreshadowing or drops your jaw with a self-eating snake scenario. It's never indulgent, yet knows exactly what it needs to be. It's thoroughly enjoyable and is easily among the best sequels of all time. 10/10",

However, Marty's nemesis, an elderly Biff Tannen (Thomas F.

Seeing the transformation from the characters in present time to the future and back to the past was just entertaining. And, Doc's notion that no two of the same persons must run into each other in the same time dimension adds onto the suspense of the film - great fun! Spot-on acting by Michael J.

            "content": "Well, if it's not the best, this is certainly the most creatively wacky opus of the timeless time-classic trilogy \u0085 \"Back to the Future Part II\" has this particular merit that it takes the opportunity to make a sequel of a great classic and push its concept to the most extreme -yet scientifically acceptable- limit. Exactly how far you can go with time travel without repeating the plot of the first movie? Well, putting their efforts together, the two Bobs (Gale and Zemeckis) took a new trajectory with one parameter to take into account, the ending of the first movie and its iconic line \"Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads\" until the De Lorean flashes its way to 2015 before the eyes of a speechless Biff Tannen.And 2015 is the problem with movies set in the future, their chances of unfortunate miscalculations get higher as we approach the crucial year. As there was no mission to Jupiter 10 years ago, in 4 years, we know there would be no Hover Board, no flying cars, not even auto-adjusting shoes and auto-drying jackets ... but seriously, what would you have expected from a comedy? The interest of 2015 was less to discover a nightmarish dystopia nightmare a la \"Soylent Green\" than to REdiscover 'Hill Valley' REdesigned as a futuristic universe not supposed to be taken seriously \u0085 Zemeckis didn't expect to make a sequel, but considering the high popularity of the first opus, what was a just-for-laughs ending became the involuntary cliff-hanger to introduce the second film. Cars had to fly, and there had to be a mission in the future.And the first act set in the future might disappoint for this lack of nostalgia feel from the first film, and something maybe too forced or artificial. However, the script gets more interesting when we discover the future of the McFly, carrying much more serious undertones and I guess we accept the silly elements of the first act (Marty's kids looking like him, to name one) because the second and the third act kind of redeem it. I'll go even further by saying that the gap between the first act and the rest of the film is the only thing that prevented that one to be my favorite. This is the film that inspired my fascination for movies featuring time loops and the ripple effect, thanks to its terrific story about the exploitation of time travel, to have a second chance in life, like in the first film, but this time, for evil purposes. On that level, \"Back to the Future Part II\" exploits the great villainous potential of Biff Tannen, who deals with our heroes every time \u0085 literally, demonstrating the limits of time travels when handled by the wrong persons. Marty realizing that he can take advantage of this little trip in the future saves the Gray Sport's Almanach \u0085 for 'his' future, and from that very point (that needed to be exploited in a time-travel film) a destructive ripple effect would create a new chain of events and ultimately, the infamous alternate 1985. As soon as Marty and Doc get back in that 'new' reality, there's the extraordinary hellish feeling of a world belonging to Biff Tannen. Honorable mention for Thomas F. Wilson who deserves more praises as the third important character of the trilogy, if only for the priceless scene when an older and wiser Biff finally corrects his younger alter ego's verbal idiocy.The Alternate 1985 is the emotional highlight of the film allowing us to breathe and meditate on the real dangers of time travels. And the icing on the cake is yet to come. After all, this is a sequel, sure, but think of one thing, why wouldn't you use time travel to revisit the same period from a new perspective? Remember the first opus when Marty got back in 1985 and witnessed a second time the dramatic 'killing' and how mislead he was by his d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu appearance. In \"Part II\", the climactic confrontation takes place in the same time than the first one, Marty has a feeling he went there the day before, the funny thing is that he meant it as a figure of speech. And for our greatest delight, we live the same scenes from the new Marty's perspective. And the thrilling part is when the characters get so close that the risk of a paradox aren't to be neglected, and the smartness of the script strikes again by using elements from the first movies as plot devices. What a pleasure to live again classic punch in Biff's face and the 'Johnny B. Goode' moment getting two times more classic. \"Back to the Future Part II\" is indeed one of the best sequels, because it obeys the very purpose of sequels, creating a feeling of deja vu with an original plot, making a film in the same vein as the first, if not with more heart, but with more gutsy creativity and the obligatory references that would become the trademarks of the trilogy, \"Mom is that you?\" \"Great Scott\", the newcomer \"Chicken!\" revealing a new interesting facet in Marty's personality. And neither of the Bobs chickened out when at the end, they felt the movie still had some more potential, so instead of a convenient happy ending, as a flash of creativity, Doc aboard the DeLorean floating in the sky, is struck by lightning and disappears ... and one minute after, Marty receives a letter from a Western Union agent, a letter written by Dog 70 years before, and we realize that at that moment, we know the ropes of time travel, because we 'got' what happened.And what a better conclusion to re-watch the most iconic part of the trilogy when the DeLorean gets back to 1985 followed by the greatest cinematic cliff-hanger : a Marty McFly back FROM the future",

            "content": "Back to the Future Part II is one of the most relentless films I've ever seen. A one hour and forty minute film yet it feels like only a fraction of that length. As the characters are already introduced to us, the movie immediately gets the ball rolling. I love how frantic and faced paced Part II is; the movie almost never pauses and is one hell of a thrill ride. How many movie sequels return to the events of the first film? I can't imagine the effort that went into recreating the scenes from the first film from different perspectives, it makes you see the first film in a whole different light. The film's portrayal of 2015, on the other hand, is the future we all wish we could have, unlike most movies which predict a future of doom and gloom. I still want those self-tying shoelaces and the pizza which can be cooked with a few seconds - its fun watching all those future gizmos. Although they got some things right; the large, flat, wide screen TV with multiple channels or the market for nostalgia with the Cafe 80's.Part II takes The Empire Strikes Back route by being darker than the first film; the alternate 1985 is like an even darker version of It's a Wonderful Life. Part II is Biff's movie; while he doesn't have the most complex personality. What makes him such a great character is all the different incarnations he has from different ages, timelines as well as his relatives. Thomas F. Wilson has by far the juiciest role in the film, playing no less than five variations of the same character and even having the young Biff interact with the old Biff. I find it funny that the universe could get destroyed just because this one guy has to be an asshole. Also, I'm not the first person to notice this but it's dawned on me how much the alternate 1985 Biff looks like Donald Trump. If the first Back to the Future showed the good side of capitalism: this movie shows the bad side of capitalism.Back to the Future Part II is one of the best examples I've seen of single actors playing multiple roles and how they seamlessly have them appear side by side and interact with each other. It still makes me wonder how they did those effects. Today, of course, they would be achieved using CGI but not back then and that's part of the fun of these effects - on top of being cool to look at - you find yourself asking \"how did they do that?\" Robert Zemeicks had just directed the technically challenging Who Framed Rodger Rabbit and then directed a film as complex as this followed by directing the third Back to the Future; someone had a busy set of years working. They also got a new actress for the role of Jennifer and even then they manage to make the change in casting appear seamless.Part II is by far the most and I do mean by far the most complex of the trilogy, these movies seriously screw with your head if you think about them too much. For example, (presuming time travel exists) if you go to the future you can't actually meet your future self, as you skipped the intervening time period by travelling forward in time, your older self would not exist in that timeline; instead you would find your loved ones mourning over the day you disappeared or how about when old Biff returns to the future after giving his younger self the almanac, should he not have returned the future which he changed? I'll admit the first time I saw it I found the plot a bit confusing; it took me a number of viewings until I finally figured out why the old Biff is in pain when he returns to 2015. I don't see these inaccuracies as a bad thing if anything they strengthen our love for these films. Part of the fun of the trilogy is discussing the time travel mechanics and trying to find explanations for any possible inaccuracy. Also one other thing I've always wondered, why does Marty make no effort to protect the letter from the rain when his life depends on it? The scene in which Doc tries to explain to Marty that they are in an alternative 1985 must have been similar to the interactions between Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale when they were writing this film.To Be Concluded...",

            "content": "After catching one of my all time favourite films (which I reviewed 1000 reviews ago) on the big screen last week, I decided to power through the trilogy since it has been awhile. The entire Back To The Future series in my opinion is absolutely brilliant. It is the quintessential 80's film, the pinnacle of time travel movies, some of the best characters, best script, and cutting edge special effects that still hold up today as far as I'm concerned. When I was a kid I probably would have slapped a 10/10 on all three of the films. I adored them and still do. In watching Back To The Future 2 for the first time in ages I was shocked to discover that while I still LOVED it...I certainly noticed a few of its (albeit very minor) flaws. Back To The Future 2 is actually very different from the original film. Its darker, over the top, even a little cheesy in some regards. It pokes fun at itself and the first film, gives us everything we could possibly want from a sequel while still managing to be a very different sort of movie. I can't think of a single other film that actually returns to the first movie in a whole new way. This is revolutionary, one of a kind and continues to floor me watching Marty's continuing adventures in the backdrop of the first film. This series could be rife with plot holes given how twisted the plot is and I'm sure if you scientifically dissect the film there are some but none that glare the average movie goer in the face. This is a brilliant sequel.Michael J. Fox is Marty Mcfly. In the first film he was smooth, suave, the perfect \"cool kid\" that you immediately wanted to be or at least hang around him. Fox returns in Back To The Future 2 and I noticed that his Mcfly this time around is a little less slick but still a great hero. He's almost just a little bit goofy compared to the first film which is a flaw to me but a minor one. Mcfly is still terrific and his turn as his own son and his daughter is awesome to watch. Christopher Lloyd absolutely shines again as the most zany and eccentric inventory Doc. Brown. Lloyd is perfect and no one else could ever make Doc come to life like always has. Best of all the backbone of this series is the incredible chemistry between Fox and Lloyd and this friendship that seems very real. Thomas F. Wilson also returns as senior Biff, middle aged Biff and young Biff and is the ultimate bully and villain. He plays all three roles flawlessly and is so great. He is one of the all time villainous greats while being a complete moron at the same time. Lea Thompson also returns in a much smaller role as Marty's Mom. Thompson is good again but the role is definitely a background role this time around. Many of the supporting characters return as well but Jennifer is replaced by the lovely Elisabeth Shue (her role is very small as well) and Crispin Glover is replaced in the future George role by Jeffrey Weissman though you can hardly tell.This trilogy single-handedly made Robert Zemeckis one of the best directors in my books. Never mind the fact that he then went on to create the incredible world of Forrest Gump (another of my top five films) and many other amazing movies. If you look at Back To The Future 2 (and the entire trilogy) from a film making perspective you can't help but be awe inspired. It is such a unique idea and pioneers the science fiction genre but creating very real characters that you relate to while being silly and outrageous and excessive and sometimes ridiculous and you love every single minute of it. The legendary soundtrack from the first film (Huey Lewis and The News) is lacking from the second film though they still have that amazing theme song of course at the height of every great climactic scene. Hoverboards, past, present and future in one film, running gags galore (manure truck, certain one liners, scenes from the first film, \"Great Scott\", the delorean...everything comes together nearly flawlessly. To further prove Zemeckis and Spielberg's brilliance working together on this, there are things they sort of forced into this sequel that weren't in the first (Marty and his fear of being called Chicken for instance) but they work it in their flawlessly and made it instantly memorable. You can't watch the first film without seeing the second...or the third but each film stands firmly in its own unique way. If you have never seen this series...you are absolutely missing out on movie genius and the most entertaining trilogy ever made and if you have seen it before, go watch it again because its rare to have this much fun. 9/10",

We travel from the 80's to mid 2010's to 80's to 50's to alternate 80's or something like that.

            "content": "This is the second film of what was one of the most remarkable trilogies of the 1980s. In the first movie, Marty McFly and \"Doc\" Emmett Brown traveled until the 1950s, until Marty's parents' dating years, using a time machine built from a DeLorean. Now, the pair will need to go to the future in 2015 to prevent Marty and Jenniffer's children from becoming delinquents and dragging the entire family to the bottom. But in the midst of it all, they still have to stop the perfidious Biff Tannen from making a fortune at the expense of inside information about future sporting results. To correct the future and save the present, therefore, it will be necessary to intervene in the past, and return to 1955.The film is clearly the continuation of its predecessor and has direct connection with it. The mix of sci fi and comedy continues to succeed but it does not prevent the feeling that this movie is, in essence, more of the same as we saw before. If we forget that brief foray into the future (which for me is already a distant past, as I write this text a few years after 2015), the film is nothing really new. At any rate, it's funny to see how, in the 1980s, someone imagined our time. Flying cars? If they only knew that we were more concerned with greening cars than flying them ... But of course, nothing should be taken too seriously here. Speaking of ecology, the film suggests in one scene that DeLorean replaced the use of plutonium with organic debris and rubbish, perhaps using an original type of composter. Curious to check this out.There is little to say about the direction of Robert Zemeckis, or even about the cast, that has not been said or observed in the previous film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd continue to dominate the film, which will be a constant throughout the trilogy. In this movie, however, the stakes of Thomas F. Wilson, an excellent villain, and Elisabeth Shue, who gain, despite their preponderance, still fall relatively sidelined for much of the movie, literally falling asleep.Special effects, visuals and sound are inseparable and important part of any sci-fi movie and here they work quite well. I thought the future was quite interesting, with ultra-modern cars and some crazy ideas, but as I said, it's not something we should take too seriously. It also struck me as interesting to see the same actor playing two versions of himself, although it was clear how this was achieved by splitting the screen.It's understandable why the movie, like the whole trilogy, became so popular. Despite being weaker than the first film, it retained its features well and honored its predecessor, leaving clear signs of a continuation. The trilogy as a whole has aged very well and still has class, charm and style, which cannot be said of all films made in the 1980s.",

            "content": "While watching the first Back To The Future installment, viewers are given wild action, intense drama, side-splitting comedy, innocent romance, and a bunch of sight/character gags sprinkled throughout. Just when things seem to be slowing down--Doc Brown races back to 1985 and whisks Marty and Jennifer into the future (via a souped-up, now flight-capable Delorean) to solve a problem regarding the newly budding couple's kids. This sets the stage for Back To The Future II, which picks up exactly at that moment and is essentially a two-hour extension of the original.For a very basic overview, the plot of this film sees the trio of Marty (Michael J. Fox), Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue), and Doc (Christopher Lloyd) jumping ahead in time to 2015, where they must rectify a situation that will inevitably lead to dire consequences for all parties involved. However, after seemingly putting the future in \"good working order\", they are in for a shock when they return to 1985 and find a few \"changes\" have taken place due to their meddlings, of which only a trip back to that fateful \"Clock Tower\" night of 1955 is needed to get \"back to the (real) future\".The first 20-30 minutes of this sequel is used to create a sort of deja-vu effect vis a vis Part One. Viewers are introduced to the \"old gang\" of characters and treated to some set pieces where, as stated by an old Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), \"there's something awfully familiar about all this\". Fun to watch, for sure, and probably played even better in 1989 as a refresher to the way this series is conceived.The main appeal of this film, however, is its ability to seamlessly connect/incorporate the events of the first film into these two hours. One approach would have been to go an entirely new direction, but here the writers make a fascinating choice to inter-weave the story with that of the original, essentially showing us events which were happening that viewers just didn't see back in 1985. A fascinating choice that mostly works, especially when dealing with the alternate-1985 angle.About the only reason I can't give BTTF2 the full five stars is simply because it lacks the once-in-a-lifetime \"teen goes back in time and sees his parents in high school\" idea or originality. BTTF is about as perfect of a film as has ever been made, and this sequel is just a half step below.Overall, this is both a technically solid and entertaining sequel to one of the greatest films of all-time. If you were blown away by the original Back To The Future, have no qualms about this one, as it will continue to entertain you like never before. Despite an odd general tendency to be viewed as a more substantial fall-off, I've just never seen it that way.",

            "content": "Like a good cliffhanger serial, the second story follows up smoothly with the first and broadens more of the world in the story.This film was one (or one of) the first ones that actually played with the concept of alternate possibilities as well as clever storytelling style by having it constantly moving to loop around back to the beginning. It's sort of the dictum sometimes when you go backward you go forward (or something like that. The special effects and sets are all top notch because their all practical, you can see they put a heck of a lot of effort into making it, as well as the painful process of construction and reconstruction, but all that pays off. It's cheerful and comical as usual however there is a dark overtone which makes the film take a bit of an unfun turn, but to me that just what makes the film more interesting and make me want the good guys to win because what happens in the film matters.The first act is a lot of fun where we see the future which looks straight out of pulp sci-fi, only it's a reality. It's a bright fun colorful cheerful future some aspects of it slightly prolific on what we have today. There are 80's cafes, hover boards, hollow graphic theaters, electric hover cars, attire that looks a little like 80's fashion only even more colorful, and other things. My favorite thing has always been the power laces, those things are awesome because I wouldn't have to stop and tie my shoes all the time, honestly who wants to and think of the amount of time it takes to do it. My favorite sequence of course is the hover board chase. But there is also a flip side of the coin to this, at the same time it's a slightly dark future because it also shows an America that has completely sold out to consumerism, big products, media, and technology. But the real darkness is when we see the grown up version of Marty, we see how one bad choice has not just made him look older than he really is but has taken away his dignity, musical ability, and reduced him to a brown noser.We then get to the second act when we see the alternate Hill Valley which is a very dark version of their present once Biff manipulates the past with information from the future for his own personal gain, and it's practically looks like Hell on Earth. It's a cesspool of crime and corruption, and there is one moment of dark discovery that made my heart sink. That moment along with seeing the older version of Marty showed how important choices we make in the present really are and they are never without consequences for the future.And of course the final act where we see them back in the same past as the original film. This was an interesting move which I don't see often let alone done well, what made it interesting was that we were seeing the movie in a different perspective this time which has been hidden away from us, sort of non linear story telling style like in \"Pulp Fiction\" or the TV show \"Lost\".If the film has a message is that the future truly is in our hands, it can be one way or another. But every decision we make must be made wisely because it will affect who we will become in the future as well as what kind we make for ourselves.Rating: 4 stars",

(if I'm right, she has never saw BTTF and I much envy her to discover the franchise at this point). On the contrary, I was totally delighted because it really pushes the time paradox to the limit and it's also a brilliant reflexion about sequels! Actually, movies invent trilogy as a stupid standard and therefore, sequels, reboot are dumb and dumber. This movie has intelligence and offers the ultimate twist of making the sequel inside the first movie! And surprise, unlike the ordinary sequels that looks like the original like a twin, this one opens perspective and reinvent the original movie. Like the first movie, the story is fast, clear. The production is clean, beautiful and the effects are used for a story and are not the story! Thanks to bright fans, we can also discover that the movie has also its bag of inconsistencies: How can the Delorean can reach 88 mph by getting struck by a thunderbolt ? and the best: How can old Biff can come back to 2015 if he has created an alternative time-line?While reading the novelization, I noticed other things: What about Griff's father and Biff's son ? The same father absence exists with Biff 1955. What about Doc 2015? Why Doc 1985 was so unfocused with Marty Jr? Now, if Biff 1955 remembers the Almanach and if Biff 1985 remembers the flying Delorean, how can things really stay the same ? But that's why we like this franchise: the more they have adventures, the less we understand !",

Second: why did they go all the way back to 1955 to retrieve the almanac from Biff. Just go back to 2015 an hour before Marty bought the almanac and either stop the purchase or buy it and burn it then. So you say, \"It's a different, altered 2015 by then, so they can't.\" If it's THAT different then Biff never could take the almanac back to give it to younger Biff in 1955, so that alternate timeline could not exist. And Doc makes such a big deal about someone interacting with their past/future selves. Well, Biff gave himself (in 1955) the almanac and explained what it would mean to younger-self Biff. Nothing bad happened with that scenario. Or go back to 1955 a day earlier than they did, slash Biff's tires or otherwise hinder the meeting with his older self. They have a TIME MACHINE! If one plan fails, go back and try again. Plus, old 2015 Biff immediately works the time machine perfectly to go to 1955 and give his young self the almanac. Then, he brings it back! Why? Let Doc and Marty be trapped and try to figure something out. Maybe they could build another time machine in the dystopian 1985 but they would need money and probably new jobs and it would take years. And how did Biff get back to the same 2015 since he altered all future events back in 1955? This sequel script has more holes than a Swiss cheese. Turn off your brain and enjoy this complete mess. I only gave it five stars because I love ripping it apart.",

            "content": "Seconds after being left back in 1985, Doc Brown returns in his Deorean and whisks Marty and Jennifer off to the future (2015). Drugging Jennifer for her own protection, Doc tells Marty that he must stand in for his own kid, stand up to Biff's son and thus avert a change of events that would eventually destroy his family. The mission is accomplished fairly easily but both Marty and Jennifer discover their future, and neither likes what they see. Marty tries to smuggle a sports almanac back in time to make money betting. Doc stops him of course but Biff senior overhears and pieces it all together. Returning to 1985, Marty discovers that the present is totally changed, meanwhile Doc works out how it all occurred and sets out to put it right.For all the criticisms of summer \"event\" pictures, it is hard to complain too much about the sheer pleasure that the Back to the Future trilogy gives. Starting where the last film ended, this picks up really well in regards mood and humour. The plot is pretty clever and superficially the complex time-travelling stuff holds up really well and is effortlessly accessible. Of course if you want to tear cosmic holes in it then it can be done but to do so would be like kicking a kitten. Using the plot from the first film to good effect the best thing the sequel retains is the original's sense of fun because it is entertaining and has good pace. One criticism of it would be that, instead of the actual plots used in parts 1 and 3, this has a lot of time jumping instead. That this works means that it isn't too bad that it is a bit overused but it is still a niggle nonetheless.The cast are as good as before and the main ones all buy into the sense of fun required to make it work. Fox shows why he was a big draw when he was younger and is the real heart of the film. He just about holds his own alongside scene-stealing Lloyd. Thompson is pretty good and Shue has more to do but from the support cast the dominant performance comes from Wilson, who is basic but does it very well. The effects are impressive for the time although watching it now you will have to forgive the very obvious split-screen technique when actors are playing different versions of the same character at the same time.It is the weakest of the three films but that is not really a major criticism in this film series because they are all consistently enjoyable. The narrative rides the time-travelling gimmick for all its worth but it just about makes it all work. A fun film in a fun trilogy that the majority of viewers will easily enjoy.",

And from that point we get an exhilarating story worthy of the first one. This is also the film that gave us most of those Back to the Future clich\u00e9s and tropes, with hoverboards, self-tying shoes and ridiculous Jaws sequel banners. The future this film imagined was an awesome place, and even though the exact date they travelled to has already passed, it's still a fun to see what the 80s thought the next millennium was going to look like.It's also a great film in terms of keeping up what worked in the original. All the actors reprise their roles, and they're as talented, great and into it as before. Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown is still easily the biggest showstealer, but both Fox and Wilson give very good and suitably over the top performances as Marty and Biff, respectively, as well.The only problem I have with this film is the fact that it goes over much of the same ground that we already covered in the first film. In many cases we even go over the exact same scenes, only from slightly different perspective. They do it cleverly and I applaud them for their ingenuity, but it still means that we for the most part already know what's going to happen, which makes certain scenes boring to watch. It doesn't really ruin the film, but it was a nuisance, at least for me.But, overall, this is an amazing sequel, one of the best the industry has ever produced. It's fast, loose, filled with laughs and even though it doesn't quite capture the flow and grace of the original, it's still more than worth checking out. Far more.",

Nevertheless, if you liked the first \"Back To The Future\" you will probably enjoy this movie. All the characters are present from the original and they are playing multiple generations almost simultaneously. The basic plot has them going to the future, to the past, and to an alternative present, which makes for a very varied set of locations to work with, even though it's technically the same area. And you get to see different versions of the characters in different circumstances. It makes for some really fun storytelling situations.Really, overall, I quite enjoyed watching this movie. I'd daresay it's actually improved with age, even in spite of it's recent resurgence in popular culture considering the time-line in which the future portions of the film occur in.

Elisabeth Shue replaces Claudia Wells as Marty's Girlfriend Jennifer. There is a lot of references to the first film which is a plus for those who love the first film.

            "content": "Trilogies are quite peculiar when viewed in retrospect. Especially when, as is the case for \"Back to the Future Part II\", the storyline is planned out ahead of time for multiple installments. After the success of the outstanding and genre-defining original, director Robert Zemekis sought to complete the story of Marty McFly with a two-part finale that would seamlessly follow on where the original ended. Zemekis, producer Steven Spielberg and writer Bob Gale in essence attempted to produce a singular cohesive story that would unfold over the course of three chapters... one big five-and-a-half- hour movie.The inherent problem with this clever but mildly flawed tactic is the fact that it can make the individual films a bit less digestible when viewed on their own. Sure, the original is stand-alone enough that it can be enjoyed as a complete experience. But you can't really watch the second or third chapters as individual films... they're too episodic and reliant on one-another. Thankfully, though, the sense of fun urgency and the likable characters still shine through, and make the second part of the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy a worthy and worthwhile watch. Even if it is a bit too self- indulgent and convoluted at times.Marty (Michael J. Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) are forced to travel throughout time once again in order correct an error made by Marty's children in the distant future of 2015. However, in a moment of greed, Marty inadvertently triggers a change in his own present time of 1985 and destroys the lives of all he loves- with his father's old nemesis Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) now in charge of Hill Valley and his father murdered. And so, Doc and Marty must once again attempt to save the present by fixing their mistakes on a journey that will take them to the past, the future and beyond!I think the key issue I have with the film is that of the three installments, \"Part II\" is by far the most needlessly complex and overstuffed entry, with contrivances and convenience taking charge a bit too often. Things just sort-of happen to manufacture tension and drama, even when they feel tacked on and sometimes superfluous. It's not enough for Marty and Doc to travel to the future for a new adventure... they need to travel to the future, then travel to the present, then travel to the past in order to fix mistakes that they themselves caused and easily could have prevented. It all feels a bit too disjointed and random. It does succeed in some playful and eye- popping world building, but its the result of a self-indulgent and shaky story as Zemekis and Gale pile on weirdness and wackiness simply for the sake of weirdness and wackiness. It's not as refined or cohesive as the original, nor is it as straight-forward and rewarding as the final chapter.Thankfully, despite my admittedly huge problem with the structure and the narrative, the film still satisfies on the whole thanks to the electrifying and endlessly likable cast and the imagination and entertainment value that Zemekis specializes in. There's a reason that Marty McFly and Doc Brown have become such beloved and recognized heroes in the annals of popular culture. And the absolutely pitch-perfect performances of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are a big part of this. Both light up the screen and compliment each other well, building off of the original and continuing to prove their remarkable chemistry with one another. They really are one of the finest teams in cinematic history. It's also a ton of fun seeing Thomas F. Wilson continue to deliver as that deliciously evil bully Biff, and supporting roles by the likes of Elizabeth Shue are very well cast. Yes, it's a shame there were some shakeups behind the scenes, and the eccentric Crispin Glover is definitely missed. But on the whole? Great jobs from all involved!And this movie is another prime example of director Robert Zemekis' wild eye for sharp and inspired visual storytelling and his playful sense of tone. The film might suffer for its shaky writing, but it makes up for it with a plethora of high-energy set-pieces and ends up a non-stop visual feast for the eyes. Each timeline presented feels \"real\" in that delightfully \"hyper-real\" way that only Hollywood can deliver, and it's a lot of fun seeing how Zemekis breathes life to different eras. His action is flowing and kinetic without relying on cheap tricks or deceptive editing, and some of the chases and fights still take your breath away all these years later. And the film delivers one of the most mind-bending sequences in movie history with a climactic scuffle that blends different eras of time in a wickedly clever manner as past and future meet once again. Suffice to say and without spoiling anything... it'll change the way you see the original!As it stands, it's hard not to admit that \"Back to the Future Part II\" is the weakest of the iconic and beloved trilogy. It's wonky and contrived and feels very much like it was written on the fly. But that doesn't make it a bad film. And in fact, it's still pretty good. The cast is as delightful and lovable as always and the story is filled to burst with clever sequences and exciting action set- pieces. And it definitely leaves you hungry for more! I give \"Back to the Future Part II\" a very decent 7 out of 10. It might be the weakest of the series, but it's still well worth checking out!",

Gladly the Back to the Future series has some more things to offer, mainly the warm atmosphere it creates alongside with likable characters that are easy to cheer for.All in all I really wasn't disappointed by this film. I felt entertained and it didn't really have lengths. I would even consider watching it again after some time.What bothered me a bit though are the plot holes. In a world where everything changes out of smallest decisions how likely is it that the sports results remain the same? Also the rules for people remembering about their time travel seem a bit vague. In a movie that's centered around that theory, I would have expected the crew to consider that.Nonetheless, if you are looking for some easy, heart-warming entertainment, this is it.",

            "content": "The journey continues, picking up right where we left off at the end of Back to the Future. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads. So off to 2015 we go. The future. And then we go hurtling back to the past, 1955 again. With a pit stop in a dystopian 1985 in between. It's quite the adventure, albeit a tad confusing if you're not really paying attention. The first movie was very straightforward, Marty McFly stuck in the past having to ensure his parents ended up together. Simple. This one is not so simple, it's a bit of a maze. But a maze well worth working your way through. Back and forth through time Marty and Doc Brown go and we're along for the very enjoyable ride.In 2015 Marty and Doc do what they set out to do, preventing Marty's future son from getting himself in major future trouble. And the vision of what 2015 would look like which director Robert Zemeckis presents is a hoot. Flying cars are only the start. But Marty and Doc aren't there for some time-travel sightseeing, they accomplish their mission and get the heck out of there and head back to 1985 before they can screw anything up. Little do they know they screwed everything up. When they get back to 1985 it is not the Hill Valley they know and love. Hill Valley is now Hell on Earth, a miserable place lorded over by the evil Biff Tannen. What happened? Well, as Marty and Doc soon discover while they were in 2015 old Biff stole the time machine and went back to 1955 where he gave his young self a sports almanac with the results of all major sporting events for the rest of the century. Biff bets on all the winners, becomes obscenely wealthy and takes over the town. When Marty and Doc get back to 1985 they find that fate and Biff have now dealt them a very unkind hand. But if Marty thinks he's got it bad he need only look at what's happened to his poor parents who've got it much, much worse. Only one thing to do. Hop in the DeLorean and head back to 1955 to prevent Biff from getting his hands on that book. They must set right what has gone horribly wrong.It all sounds a bit convoluted and in truth there are times where the movie is a little too complex for its own good. The first movie was just flat-out fun all the way through. Here the movie has to slow down to explain itself. And things are much bleaker this time around too, the alternate 1985 being such an awful place. The sooner the movie gets out of there the better off it is. Especially considering where it is the movie's going. Back into 1955, back into the very day which served as the climax of the first film. Yep, we're going back to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance. It's the rare opportunity for a movie to go back into itself, see itself from new perspectives and Zemeckis takes full advantage of the opportunity. Those scenes we know so well from the first film are given new twists and it is here that this sequel really shines. Watching Marty try to solve his new problem without undoing what he did in the first film is simply terrific stuff. Part II may not have been as consistently captivating, nor as out and out fun, as the original but the story ultimately pays itself off brilliantly.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are pitch-perfect again as Marty and Doc. Thomas F. Wilson does a great job playing multiple incarnations of the villainous Biff. Poor Lea Thompson spends most of her screen time playing older versions of Marty's mom Lorraine, to whom time has been unkind. Thompson does what she has to do well but the film does miss that youthful charm, spunk and vivaciousness of the first film's Lorraine. And the film also clearly misses Crispin Glover in the role of George McFly. Glover is such a unique performer, he brought so much bizarre yet endearing personality to the role of George. This film's attempt to work around Glover's absence is awkward to say the least. But best not to quibble about what this movie misses. Better to embrace what it has. It's a great story which takes us on a wild journey through the space-time continuum. Yes that story requires a little effort on the part of the audience to keep up through all its twists and turns. This movie doesn't make itself as easy to enjoy as the first one did, you have to work a little for this one. It's worth working for. Marty and Doc are such great characters, such a great team. You can't wait to see where they go next. Part III couldn't come soon enough.",

            "content": "PLOT SPOILERS:Picking up directly where Part I finished off, Doc Brown arrives in his DeLorean time machine to take Marty McFly and girlfriend Jennifer Parker to 2015, where their future kids Marty Jr and Marlene are in trouble and only Marty can save them. Marty poses as Marty Jr to get his son out of trouble and achieves this, although not quite as he and Doc had planned! Biff Tannen, now 78, manages to steal the time machine and goes back to November 12th 1955, where he gives his 18 year old self a sports almanac with results from 1950-2000. Marty and Doc return to 1985 to find that Biff is rich and powerful after using the almanac to place bets, and after having murdered Marty's father George is married to Marty's mother Lorraine! The only way to fix things is to once again go back to 1955 and get the almanac off 1955 Biff - but without interfering with any of the events from Part I, and avoiding any lightning bolts when your time circuits say \"January 1st 1885\"!Usually with sequels, they pale in comparison to the original. This one is an exception in that as in may cases it is literally the same as the original! Part II is a very thought provoking sequel with lots of plot twists and turns, and the various times visited, and not running into your older self, that it is one of the best and most original sequels out there. Be warned though, you may not understand parts of it unless you've seen Part I.Michael J Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Tom Wilson all return from Part I, and each of them is just as good as their roles as they were in Part I. Tom Wilson especially manages to play all the different versions of Biff, as well as Griff Tannen in 2015, very well. Lots of supporting cast members from Part I also return, and it is like hanging out with old friends again. Many critics think that Crispin Glover's decision not to return (he played George McFly in Part I) spoilt the film, but I think it made it better. Nothing against Glover, he is a very good actor, but since the writers did not have Glover, they wrote him out by creating the alternate 1985 where George is dead. This also leads to the brilliant (and unique) idea of going back to 1955, and watching events from the first film from a different perspective. You also get to relive scenes such as George (played by Jeffrey Weissman) punching Biff, and the Johnny B Good scene, once more.A bit on the future. The real 2015 will be nothing like the 2015 we see on screen, and that is a bit of a disappointment, as 2015 is very lively and colourful. Hoverboards, flying cars, thumbprint IDs - they're all there, and it is a future you would want to live in. Hill Valley in 2015 certainly IS a nice place to live! The fates of the characters in 2015 - a little different. Jennifer discovers Marty grows up to be stuck in a dead end job, having thrown his life down the toilet after an accident in 1985. This idea of the main character's life not being what he expected it to be in Part I is a good and amusing one. Part II also saw the debut of the VistaGlide system which allowed one actor to play 2 or more characters at once, and it works so well you can hardly tell where the split is.The music score is based on the Part I score and is still very good. I like the darkness of the 1985-A music, and the optimism of the 2015 music. There are more songs, only fewer in Part II, although what ones they do have are very good.Overall, a thoughtful and original film that tells a story whilst leaving questions for Part III to answer. This was the first time 2 movies were filmed back to back, and Parts II and III compliment each other. The cliffhanger ending was also a brave move by the filmmakers, making you wonder what will happen next. 10/10.",

The script was far too ambitious and falls apart constantly with endless logistical errors and implausible plot leaps.Despite this, the film is still very enjoyable and unlike any other in its genre. The scenes where Marty returns to 1955 and encounters parts of the original story (including himself) are incredibly creative and great fun to watch.The make-up is somewhat disappointing and Thomas Wilson probably deserved better than to be turned into a bizarre waxwork. Everyone still looks great in 1955 but the 2015 characters are a bit far-fetched and ridiculous, particularly with Michael J Fox playing his entire family.Nevertheless, I have watched this move countless times and never get bored with it. If nothing else, it nicely bridges the gap to the finale and allows us all to be disappointed that we STILL don't have hoverboards.",

They backed themselves into a corner where they were forced to start the movie in the future with Jennifer (now played by Elisabeth Shue) joining them but with a clever plot full of twists, it works perfectly.Marty and Doc arrive in 2015 to try and prevent an event which threatens to destroy Marty's entire family's future and things look very different from 1985.Rather than portraying a realistic version of what they predicted the future would be like, the writers and director wisely played it for laughs. That said it's amazing how many technological things in the movie have actually happened since it was made. The special effects, in particular the flying cars and hover boards still hold up well 25 years later.The script plays around with it's ideas and makes some funny references to the first movie without looking tired, instead it's more like a wink to the audience that adds to the enjoyment. The only time the movie really slows down is when it shows older Marty at home with his family but the point is to show the similarities between Marty's family and his own before he changed things for the better. Having been injured in a drag race, Marty is now just as much a loser as his dad was and his family are just as dysfunctional. It might seem like a bit of a pointless sequence on first viewing but it's setting up an important plot point for the third movie.Once Marty and Doc have taken care of Marty's future family problem the main plot kicks in when Biff steals the Delorean to change history for the worst and this is where the movie really takes off. Marty and Doc's only hope to salvage everything is to get back to 1955, in order to save the future.It's an original and entertaining scenario to see the events of the original movie from a different perspective, and amazingly it avoids becoming dull by doing so.Fox and Lloyd once again show off great chemistry together and put a lot of energy into their roles. Fox is funny playing his older self, his son and even his daughter! And Thomas F.Wilson is even better than he was in the original. Now he's playing different ages and versions of Biff in different time lines, as well as the grandson Griff, and he pulls it off very well.From 2015 to a nightmarish 1985 and all the way back to 1955, it's a fun, fast-paced sequel full of wit and imagination.",

            "content": "Even from the ending of the first part, the plot of this movie sounded idiotic. Here's why:Marty has to go to the future to change something that hasn't even happen? I mean what could he changed since the future hasn't happened yet? Isn't his duty warned by \"Doc\" to prevent those bad things from happening rather than travelling to the future and then having hundreds of complications? And I just realized what this movie promotes: laziness as a parent. Why should you be responsible for your kids growth when you can hop on a time machine and fix whatever they do wrong in the future. Just think about that for a second? Movies used to inspire people to be mature, open-minded and responsible, not this one anyway. Yes, I know why... because we need a sequel! And that's the only reason this movie exists: to make Back to the Future to have a sequel. Not because there was a logical reason for it... illogical reason is the motif for this movie existing (if you catch my irony here).Aside from that the movie had horenderous acting with sooo many over the top performances that were made either for children or to emphasise the good or bad guys. Then there is the famous \"un- futuristic\" future that soo many movies from the 20th century had. Next, there is more illogical things like Biff somehow knowing how to set the flux capacitor and the time date and TRAVEL IN THE FREAKING PAST! How can I be the only one who thinks this is ridiculous and ilogical??? Did he had a course on how to use the deLorean time machine? No. Did he ever saw it? No. Then why did he assumed that it was a time machine? Because the plot needed to get more complicated that's why. And yet so many people accept this soo easily and call this one of the best sequels ever. Well... in my opinion is one of the worst movies of all time due to the ilogical plot, un-futuristic future, unnecessary complications, cringy acting and ilogical story made for kids.If there is ever a 0 rating or if IMDb decides to introduce percentages along with movie ratings I'll gladly rate this garbage with 0.Oh... but calling this thing garbage would be an insult to the things I throw away.",

In fact, we not only got \"Part II\", but highlights of a \"Part III\" to come were also shown - which was a smart marketing move, because \"Part II\" definitely leaves you hanging at the end. By today's standards, it might take a decade to get a sequel made, and we are okay with it. But, back then, if you waited for more than 2 years, you might have waited too long. Fortunately for us, everything that worked in the first film translated to this one without any problems.This 2nd entry into the trilogy picks right up where the 1st one left off, with Doc telling Marty and Jennifer that he needs their help in the future with their kids. Off they fly, into the future, leaving a couple of fire trails in the sky. Only, Biff witnesses the event and everything changes. In this film, we actually get to travel ahead in time to the future, and we are given a glimpse of what it could look like with outlandish outfits, hairstyles, and face make-up. In correcting one situation, Marty inadvertently creates a new one which alters everything in the past. Now they must return to the pivotal year of 1955 to make it all good again.Four years had passed since I had seen the first one. I was 16 when I saw it. This sequel was released late in the year in November, so I was already 21 when it came out. A lot had changed for me in that time span ... I was living on my own, engaged to be married, and employed full time. I was hoping they hadn't waited too long - and to my surprise, I really enjoyed this movie. The chemistry was still there, the movie magic was still there, and the overall feel of the first movie was also still there. In fact, to me, the only noticeable change was with Elisabeth Shue replacing Claudia Wells for the role of Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer.I highly recommend this movie. It is very strong and a fun rollercoaster ride through time. The storyline was fitting and kept you invested. It was a great nod to the original film, and set up the final one perfectly. I left the theater smiling and anticipating \"Part III\". This is a solid 8 stars out of 10.",

However, by a curious turn of events, Marty and Doc have to travel back to 1955, the same year Marty traveled to the previous day, in the first movie.The plot of this film is more complicated than the first one, with multiple time-lines in the past, present and the future. There are multiple Martys, Docs, Jennifers and Biffs at a given time. As you can see, it explores the consequences of time-travel in greater detail. But it is never confusing and as light-hearted as the first movie. It has a lot of good, intelligent comedy. It is nice to see all our favorite characters from the first movie.

Plus why is the daughter played by Micheal J.

Having alternate timelines, going both back and forward, and making the future, a future that isn't bleak and depressing. The future is just plain awesome, overblown in the way people dress, but awesome. The hoverboard chase scene in my opinion is even better than the skateboard chase in the first film. It has some pretty damn great effects for the time. I still can't believe that putting Micheal J. Fox as three people in the same shot was possible in 1989. It's still extremely funny, and I like how dark it gets in the second half.Is the first film technically better, yes it is, but I enjoy this movie more, it takes full advantage of it's time travel premise, and is just a lot of fun.",

All of those elements make Back To The Future Part II while not as good as the first film,a great sequel in the Back To The Future series.Set after the events in the first film,Back To The Future Part II finds Marty(Michael J. Fox)and Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd)time traveling to the future in 2015. When Marty and Doc return to 1985,they discover that Hill Valley in 1985 has become a dark wasteland thanks to Biff(Thomas F. Wilson)who took the time machine and altered 1985. Now,Marty and Doc have to go back to 1955,stop Biff and go back to their lives as they remember it.After the worldwide Box Office success of the original Back To The Future in 1985,it seem obvious that there would be a sequel which would come four years later with Back To The Future Part II a brilliant and entertaining sequel(which was filmed back to back with Part III)that was a Box office hit and is a film that is just memorable and fun from start to finish. Making a sequel to a classic film like Back To The Future is no easy task,but director Robert Zemeckis has crafted a movie that while giving viewers more of the same laughs,adventure and thrills like the original while also giving Back To The Future fans something that feels fresh and exciting at the same time standing on it's own two feet while being a sequel to the first movie. The Comedy and laughs in Back To The Future Part II are funny,hilarious and on par with the original and not a moment is wasted. The scenes with the iconic Deloren car(this time flying instead of driving)are still amazing and will keep viewers thrilled and entertained. The screenplay by Bob Gale is wonderful with dialog and scenes that make the movie feel alive and imaginative. Back To The Future Part II is a film that brings back some of the characters from the first film like Marty,Doc Biff,Loraine and others and takes the concept of time travel from the first movie and gives it a clever story line on a much larger and bigger scale playing with the very serious consequences and repercussions of time-traveling with Marty and Doc going to the future,the present and then the past showing that while time traveling can be fascinating and interesting time traveling can be dangerous if used in the wrong way with Marty and Doc finding out the hard way. When Marty and Doc travel to the future in 2015 to help with Marty's kids Hill Valley's future is optimistic and bright with advanced technology and flying cars while Marty's future isn't so bright. But when the duo go back to 1985 they discover that they are in an alternate Dystopian 1985 where violence and crime is up in Hill Valley and Biff is running the town. The scenes in the alternate 1985 give BTTF II a dark tone that is sinister showing that even the smallest events can change anything. I love the fact that in Part II that Marty and Doc have to go back to 1955 to repair 1985 as they remember it and as viewers we see some of the events from the first film showed in this one with some minor alterations. The story for BTTF PT II may have the most complex story of the three film but the movie won't be hard to follow. The ending of Back To The Future Part II is a terrific and memorable cliffhanger ending that has surprises and thrills which sets viewers up for the final chapter in the series in Back To The Future Part III. AN amazing ending.The cast is great. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are excellent and brilliant once again as Marty McFly(and multiple roles)and Doc Brown,with the two bring laughs and wonderful chemistry. Lea Thompson is terrific as Lorraine,Marty's Mother. Thomas F. Wilson is delightful as Biff and Griff,Biff's grandson. Elisabeth Shue(replacing Claudia Wells)is good as Jennifer,Marty's girlfriend. James Tolkan is great once again as Strickland,the hard nose teacher. Casey Siemazko(3-D),Billy Zane(Match),J.J Cohen(Skinhead),Charles Fleischer(Terry)and Flea(Needles)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for an early appearance by a young Elijah Wood as Video Game Boy.The direction by Robert Zemeckis is fantastic with Zemeckis bringing the same energy and style he brought to the first film. Amazing direction,Zemeckis.The score by Alan Silvestri is outstanding with Silvestri's score being epic and intense matching the movie greatly. Fantastic score,Silvestri.The Special effects by Industrial,Light and Magic are dazzling and mind blowing once again. Nice job,ILM.In final word,if you love Robert Zemeckis or the first film,I highly suggest you see Back To The Future Part II,an excellent and unforgettable sequel that will stay with you after you watch it. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",

            "content": "Back to the Future was one of a kind. It was written that way; exceptional attention was paid to detail, and it paid off. Zemeckis had a hit on his hands, and movie audiences swooned: Michael J. Fox at the pinnacle of his acting career paired with a high budget, fantastic script, there was no way the original could fail. Sequels, unless planned, are fated to surpass the bar set by the original story. When the secondary and tertiary scripts are not planned at the same time, the result is cotton candy fare that leaves you feeling empty, like this movie does.Sadly, the sequel(s) reflect the need for Hollywood suits to capitalize on an excellent idea. Instead of inventing truly original second and third scripts where none was originally intended, this and the third film were called for to fill the bank accounts of those involved. Although there are moments when BTTF II shines - such as the splicing of original material with old, bringing back scenes from the beloved original, there is so much kitsch and poor acting, even from the principals, that it's hard to swallow.Michael is Michael, Marty is Marty. Chrisopher Lloyd is Christopher Lloyd, Doc is Doc, and that's about it. Oh yeah, let's not forget old Einstein. The rest of the cast, while mostly returning, could have been forgotten. Michael J. Fox as his son AND daughter? Please. Lea Thompson struggles with multiple identities... the characters are so far beyond belief that it's painful. Where the original film almost made time travel seem plausible (albeit in a goofy way) the sequels make a parody of the original script and seem more like an insult. The budget covers makeup and some fantastic ideas, but it can't cover up the forced feeling that this film and its successor share. Slick effects and obvious humor can't save sequels, but the need to capitalize on a successful franchise overrides originality. Everything about this movie seems clich\u00e9d instead of daring. Some actors define their careers by being involved in quality productions; in this film time the cast shows their need to finance a yacht payment.If you can suspend all need for believability, this flick might get it done. But it won't work without the third installment, and for once in my life I have to give credit to Crispin Glover: he may be a freak, but he's an honest freak, and he stayed away from the scripts for a reason. I'd recommend that you do too. Watch the first installment as intended: a standalone production, and find better fare if you need to watch a movie instead of the the poor sequels.",

            "content": "Ah Back to the Future. What a timeless classic that film was back in the 80's. It broke new grounds in time travel as a sub-genre in sci-fi movies of the 80's. But how about we experience it again? Sounded great and ludicrous at the same time. The original ended on a cliff-hanger and fans were expecting another Zemeckis masterpiece! Did they get it? ABSOLUTELY!!! I will go far as to say its even better than the original! How did it manage to do that? Well it utilizes the time-travel concept in the story very well and it tied together perfectly. Great job Zemeckis for that phenomenal directing! When people first saw it they thought it was gonna be an impossible feat for the film to match and to exceed the original! But it did! Enough of the history lets get down to brass tax! Back to the Future Part II is the sequel to the critically acclaimed Back to the Future. Doc takes Marty and Jennifer(Elizabeth Shue) to 2015 to save their son's future! Meanwhile, in 2015, Marty decides to get a hold of a sports almanac and use time travel as a means of making money. Hmm... a wanna-be billionaire? Isn't that what we wanna be now-a-days? Anyway, Biff gets a hold of the almanac and goes back to 1955 and all hell breaks loose in the time lines. What makes this work is that every scene is cohesively done well and is perfectly paced! Michael J. Fox gives a great performance as Marty as always from Fox. Doc Brown is still fantastic as the mad scientist Doc Brown and my favorite character Biff is just as mean and hilarious as ever! Biff is absolutely freaking hilarious in this movie and has the most funniest quotes I have ever heard in movie history! \"Hey butt head!\" \"Why don't you make like a tree and get out of here!\" OH SO FUNNY XDXDXD Now what did I appreciate in this movie? I love the fact that every scene flows well in this series of events happening in different time periods. I loved the way they fit Old Mcfly with Young Mcfly in the future! Great filmmaking at its finest! I loved all the characters(mainly Biff). Lasy but not least I love the performances and memorable quotes in this movie! It has a certain charm to me that causes to like it every time I watch it! Plus, the special effects were fantastic and the costumes and set work were really good in depicting the future and the past! However, one minor thing that went under my skin was when they repeated the quote \"Chicken\" all the time. But, its not something that breaks the movie it just was a little annoying. But all in all it is a fantastic sequel to already an incredible movie and exceeds the original ten-fold! So get your Delorean to 88 mph and get ready for another awesome ride!!!",

            "content": "1989's Back To The Future Part II happens to be one of my favorite movies the film almost matches the original Back To The Future in quality and popularity. This movie has it all drama, comedy and most of all the biggest adventure of your life a great thrill ride! BTTFP2 can become confusing to the viewer it like many films is one where you have to pay close attention you can't miss a minute also you must have saw the first Back To The Future to get any enjoyment and meaning out of this film. The film does a good job of showing how the future that of 2015 could look like at the time at first in 1989 those future inventions and creations seemed long away, but not now as we are in the year 2000. This film also flashes back to the first Back To The Future that's why BTTFP2 almost matches the original in quality and popularity. Along with the technique of flashback irony is present in the form of Marty McFly's (Michael J. Fox's) travel back to 1955 once again just as in the first film only this time to change it back to the original 1985. So this is a sequel which repeats the original in many ways. Once again the acting is great Michael J. Fox as always gives a great performance he simply is one of Hollywood's greatest actors ever.Lea Thompson gives another good performance. Hey I could just go on and on in fact I have seen this movie about 75 to 100 times, just as much as the first Back To The Future. This film has ran for many years on the SCI-FI and USA cable networks and should continue to do so due to popularity. Simply put one of the best ever watch it again and again it seems to get better with age.",

            "content": "The above title is how movie critic Gene Siskel, described the film. Now I've never been one to agree with the critics, but I have to side with Gene on this one. This movie was dull, and there's one thing that the original has, that this first sequel doesn't have: Heart. The plot is this: Doc returns from the future, and tells Marty that he must accompany him to the future to prevent a future catastrophe that involves his kids, Marty complies, and once they're in the future, Doc tells Marty that his future son will be arrested, and that this one event will cause a chain reaction and destroy his entire family. (Which is a falsehood, but I'll elaborate on this, when I review part III.) While in the future Hill Valley, Marty visits an antique store and buys a magazine that will tell him the results of every sporting event until the end of the century. Doc finds the magazine, scolds Marty for buying it, and throws it away. Unfortunately, an older version of Biff hears this, retrieves the magazine, steals the time machine, (and somehow knows how to use it.) travels back in time, and gives the magazine to himself in 1955. Upon doing this, the present changes, and Hill Valley becomes a despotic, hell on earth. Therefore, Marty and Doc must travel back to 1955 and put things right. I've never cared for this movie. While I can watch it as a time waster, the film desperately lacks the magic that the first film had. As with the first film, there are great performances all around, but the story is where the film fails. If their goal was to tell a story about how time travel can be misused, that's fine, but why does this film have to re-hash everything that the previous film did? For example: Marty's confrontation with Griff (Biff's son) in The Cafe 80's, and the following hover-board scene, are exact copies of the confrontation with Biff,and the skateboard scene from the previous film! When Doc and Marty are in 1955, what do we see? The exact same things from the first film! Maybe I'm in the minority here, but when I go into a sequel, I don't wanna see the same thing over again, I wanna see something new! I would say that this film was a huge step down from the previous film, but it wasn't. It was actually a whole flight of stairs down from the previous film! So after all that, you may be wondering why I gave the film three stars instead of one. Well the reason for that is, I liked the 2015 Hill Valley setting. It was the one and only time that the film was fun. Even though it was a blatant rip- off, the hover-board scene was still fun. I only wish that the whole film could have taken place in the 2015 setting. As a sequel, Back to the future II fails. On its own, it still fails. Which is what I've always seen Back to the future II as, one utterly disappointing failure.",

            "content": "Wednesday October 26, 2015Far from the tumult of Hill Valley, Lima appears a normal day, each inhabitant with his routines, going in public transport or in terrestrial cars towards the work, the school or the university. There is no flying car or aircraft; the roads are still up to us, you can walk on them without falling into a void.On the way to the corner bar, there is a park where the skaters juggle with the board. They are incapable of flying that objects, they only rotate in the air thanks to the impulses of their owners, without floating.Next to the park there is a coffee bar. The sign hardly shines or moves. The bar offers refreshments of all kinds, as classic as Coca- Cola, lacking Pepsis Perfect. Without holes-robots that carry the drink wherever one sits, the waiter brings the drink to the corresponding place.Along the street there are people walking with their Nike, their Vans or their Puma, which do not have an overhead propeller. Neither are dogs walking alone.My home is normal, with painted walls, a salon in which stands a television with plasma screen above a piece of furniture and a reddish sofa. I do not have the honor of having TV walls and screens that protrude from the closets, though they would be quite practical. Neither do I have the privilege of having seen Jaws 19, and if it existed, I do not know if I could bear it.I live in an environment dominated by ultra-thin computers, plasma screens, touch-sensitive phones and electronic devices connecting wirelessly, or what is the same: Wi-Fi. I live well, in a technologically advanced society, something that was predicted in a way 20 years ago in some science fiction films.Future journeys in fiction entail a dose of imagination on the part of its creator. The ambiance and futuristic arrangements that are made are impossible to be 100% successful, each director and scriptwriter try to play their way, and can hardly hit the spot. Nor do they have the obligation to be visionaries. In Blade Runner, Terminator, Clockwork Orange, Her or Mr Nobody are manufactured in one way and labeled as dystopias. If my father in the 80s, with only 20 years, had traveled 30 years ahead, it would never have been possible to imagine that the present society would be as it is.Marty McFly accidentally changed the lives of his parents at a time when he was not even born, succumbed to the temptation to change the way they fell in love, and then scored a rock and roll with Johnny B. Goode, a song not yet written (landmark of cinema). How many would we take a temporary trip to contemplate other times? Time travel in the cinema is usually pleasant to watch, even if it is foreseeable round trip trips.Back To The Future is an icon inside a family commercial cinema that had its boom from the 80's; its image and idea has influenced productions of future generations. Quite simply, the difference between the commercial of now and the former is its magic, a magic that now finds it difficult to find and / or believe. Few movies have a script as simple and effective as Back To The Future: a broken love story with a cupid falling from the future to fix it. Likewise, he likes it very much; I may be subjectivized, but I can not help it: I saw her at the age of only 9 and my memories invade me. We all know how it ends, and even Zemeckis decided to give ball to two more parts; one undervalued and the other made a little out of obligation. The second part includes three temporary trips and three different generations: the 50, the 80 and the 2010. It is a chaotic film in the plot and unpredictable, something that is appreciated. And it was the one that marked a milestone in pop culture because Marty lands in our 2015.After so many years of having seen the trilogy for the first time (and having repeated it so many times), we finally broke the 30-year span between Marty's real life and that of 2015. I feel a little older because I was thinking about the day that Marty McFly would arrive and I was far away. But here I am, writing about something that is happening today. Tomorrow Back To The Future will become part of the past once and for all. It will remain in our heads and hearts as one of the films that have left us the most footprint. Marty will not return later, will travel back in time to a landscape west and then relive as it should in 1985.Whether or not Zemeckis agrees with his predictions is not of importance. Today we celebrate something fictitious that so many fascinated in its day. For these reasons, the term \"cinema\" is of such a complicated definition.",

Four years after the great success of the first \"Back to the Future\" film, Director Robert Zemeckis released the first of the two sequels in 1989 - just titled \"Back to the Future Part II\".After Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) correct the time-line by traveling to 1955 in the first film, \"Back To The Future Part II\" starts immediately where the first movie left off. Marty McFly, along with his girlfriend Jennifer and Dr Emmett Brown, travel to 2015 to correct a few glitches in the McFly family's future. They think they've fixed things, but when they return home to the year 1985, they discover the present has changed and not for the better. So, it's off to 1955 for another set of adventures and the chance to put things right. Like the first part the end of the flick sets the plot for the next part.A throwaway line provided at the end of the first Back to the Future provides the basis of the plot for \"Back to the Future Part II\". It's intended to be far darker than its predecessor and serves as a bleak middle part to the franchise - like \"The Empire Strikes Back\" was to \"Star Wars\".Robert Zemeckis pioneered a few production tricks during the filming, including the notion of filming two concurrent sequels to keep productions costs lowered and using motion control technology to have the same actors interact with each other. Part III was released just a few months later in 1990.The movie itself has a ton of plot holes, differences from its predecessor in terms of continuity and a lot of other flaws. But what makes it special, for me and a lot of other people who grew up in the 80s, is its nostalgic factor. The general tone along with weird ideas like the Hoverboard, clever dialogs and the great performances by Christopher Lloyd or Michael J. Fox provide an amusing comedy. Not more but also not less. It's not like the first film but it had a well earned impact on pop culture and it was one of the first movies I remember seeing in theaters - like \"Ghostbusters 2\" or \"Indiana Jones 3\" the movie just resembles childhood for me. I even had a radio-play version on cassette tape.After we reached the future on October 21st 2015 one can still realize the creative potential it had commenting on pop culture of the 80s. Some things were a little optimistic, such as flying cars oder the self tying shoes, but the movie got one thing completely right: the future will always have a fascination of certain decades such as the 80s. Call it \"retro\".My final verdict is 8 out of 10 - but only when viewed with holographic glasses and a Pepsi Perfect.",

My only real issue with the film is actually Jennifer's replacement actress. She didn't look anything like Jennifer from the original and it threw me off. Apart from that, this film tied the two perfectly well, everything blended in brilliantly and in the end it became only 110 minutes long! Oh boy!?! I would've loved to see this another 25 minutes longer, that's how good it was and I normally don't like seeing extended editions to movies. Christopher Lloyd as Doc was just as great as he was in the original, a confused and strange old man who is extremely lovable and funny! Him and Marty again steal the show with their incredible chemistry. I loved how the film starts with the trio going to 2015 to save their children and then going back to 1985 to see a drastic change (alternative world) has emerged. I loved, how they then had to go all the way back to 1955 (which would eventually tie brilliantly with Back to the Future) to save the present day and get back the normal world. This film could've easily been a horrible mess! It just wasn't! I mean, with all the different time travelling it could've been a mess had it not been properly directed, written or executed. Part I and Part II have gotten me SO excited that I'm dying to watch the 3rd and final installment! That brings me to my next point. I loved how the ending told you that a further adventure would need to take place as Doc had landed himself back in 1885! Back to the Future Part I and Part II are not special effects movies (like SW prequels) but focus entirely on the acting, dialogue and story. This is what every story must focus mainly on and BTTF gets it all right! Superb movie- Definite MUST see for any Back to the Future fans, although YOU MUST watch the original first as everything here links back to the original. 9/10!",

Yes, there is only one first time with these things and the beauty of the first adventure was that we got to see Marty McFly interact with his parents when they were his age and the sheer brilliance of that idea was always going to be difficult for the creative minds behind this sequel to top. What they have come up with is a smart,complex weaving of overlapping time frames that keeps you as a viewer on your feet while riffing on many of the ideas from the first film. The trip in to the future is a sheer joy as we see 2015 (four years away), and the imagination and wit that has gone in to creating a not so distant future vision. The 'mcguffin' on this occasion, a future sports results book that falls in to the wrong hands and goes back to 1955, doesn't evoke the same fun as the McFly family ties, but the journey is one well worth taking and in the end you have to surrender to the energy and fun of this very well imagined and thought out sequel. It's a shame the excellent Crispin Glover doesn't return as George McFly but the rest of the cast all live up to previous performances and Zemeckis handles the complex structure with enviable skill.",

There I sat at the far right of the largest theater, next to the wall since the place was packed, and on the edge of my seat, for the entire length of 'Back to the Future Part II.' See, I was a huge fan of the original, and was thrilled to see the continuation. I wasn't let down. It had action, adventure, 4x the time travel (which originally I was disappointed in #1, since I was a kid that wanted to see time travelers actually time travel), comedy and suspense. I guess the only thing I didn't like, though I did want to see even more when it finished, was the long preview of 'Part III' and the only reason I wasn't thrilled was I didn't like westerns and that's all it looked like to me. This was probably the best movie going experience in my life, before and since \u2013 due to the anticipation and excitement of a 15-year-old boy. Fast forward almost exactly 20 years, and after re-watching the entire trilogy, I was kind of disappointed. Sure, it's still a good movie, still had great adventure and comedy, but gone was the original's magic and heart. Too many scenes, characters, events and clues were given specifically to be solved or revealed in 'Part III.' I know it's a classic bridge movie, but it really got tedious attempting to take mental notes of what's to come. The special effects were almost laughable (the first movie came out 4 years prior and still topped this one) and Fox certainly showed his age. Nevertheless, it's a must see for fans, especially since it's required viewing (bridge) to the finish off the series.",

Therefore 'Part II' was always going to have a hard job when it came to competing. I was only twelve when it was released and, in short, I loved it. However, even back then long before the days of internet message boards and Twitter, I remember picking up on the mutterings from film critics about how it wasn't a patch on the original. Now, I'm not about to commit blasphemy and tell you that it is. I'm just saying that it's a great, fun film and it continues the story just perfectly.Sequels that outdo their original are few and far between, but this one does have enough memorable moments to really hold their own over time and remain in the public's consciousness, even today (Marty's 'self-lacing' Nike trainers, anyone?). If ever a story picked off where the last one left off, it was 'Back to the Future Part II.' Who among us wasn't dying to know where Marty and Doc were going to next and the sight of our favourite time-travelling car flying off into our faces only filled us with intrigue. And, when they arrive in the 'future,' or at least 2015 as was depicted back in the 80s, it's filled with weird and wonderful gadgets (which - naturally - are still waaay off where we are today, technologically). Marty has to prevent an incident in his son's future that will bring down his family-life to come. naturally, not everything goes to plan and he and Doc are forced to zip back and forth through time in order to correct things. And, like I say, I loved it then and I still do.However, that's just my opinion and I think it's fair to address some of the criticisms it's picked up then and now. Some people resent a few casting changes that occurred between films, others say that the future is too over-the-top, plus it retreads old ground (sometimes remaking scenes deliberately in homage to its own predecessor), but without any of the charm and others resent the way it ends (I should warn you that it's designed to be a 'middle film,' therefore I'm guessing the film-makers had no plans to end the story with Part II.Personally, I didn't mind and of that. If I could nit-pick one single thing it would be something I note now about the story-telling 'suspension of disbelief' which seems to go hand in hand with all time travel movies. Namely something happens which causes 'time' to spew off in a different direction, but, due to the paradox this would actually cause, the plot falls apart on a plot hole. However, I didn't notice that when I was younger and I'm sure not going to let it ruin my enjoyment of the film now.There are few movies nowadays that the whole family can sit down and enjoy (okay, maybe 'Ready Player One' will be one day), but, right now, all three 'Back to the Future' movies deserve their place in cinematic history. Watch it now before it gets remade!",

            "content": "Next up in my series of BTTF reviews is Back to the Future Part II, the film that wowed everyone with a glimpse at what the future could possibly look like, and although it is clearly nothing like it was envisioned in 1989 it is still very interesting to see the 'future that could have been' come to life on screen. Back to the Future Part II did what all sequels should do, it was larger in scale, it took bigger risks and it took the series to a whole new dimension by really focusing on the use of time travel. Now although it was bigger and the timelines got a whole lot more complex, topping the first film was nearly impossible but they tried their hardest and it payed off, making this film also an instant classic. Like its predecessor, this was also an endlessly entertaining film, still capturing the same humour that the first film did so well it manages to make you laugh consistently throughout. The characters of Doc and Marty again have great comedic timing and their chemistry is like no other film and it adds to the realism of these characters relationship. Whilst also maintaining that comedic aspect, the film also does spend quite a bit of time getting pretty serious and developing the plot for later in the film and for Part 3. This film had the daunting task of having to top the first one, and how do you do that? Rather than going 30 years in the past they decided to go 30 years into the future. But why stop there? lets go 30 years into the future then 30 years into the past in another timeline and then 30 years into the past again just to mess with people. Although there was a lot of jumping between timelines in this film it managed to hold itself together very well without seeming like it was moving too fast. As expected, with all of these time jumps, the timeline of events is going to get a little more confusing, but the film i thought did a pretty great job at keeping audiences informed as to what was going on. There were a few exposition scenes that were a little too 'heavy' on information that could have been spread out a little. Having just watched it for like the 10th time, it all makes sense to me but for a first time watcher it may take another viewing to fully grasp the timeline changes. A very minor thing in a film that still does time travel better than 98% of time travel films out there. One of the things that this film is remembered for is its visualisation of the future. Seeing all of these technological advancements in terms of cars, and clothes, and shoes, and hover-boards was incredibly mind-blowing for me when i watched it so you could imagine how it must have been for an audience that was even further away from that possible reality. It was a very interesting contrast with other more dirty dystopian futures you see in most sci-fi films, the cleaner, brighter look made it so much more memorable. Like i said, they are the scenes everyone remembers, the hover-board chase scene is an iconic action sequence that will never be forgotten, the sequence in Marty's future house was amazing seeing all of the small but significant advances in technology that people would only dream of. Many people often forget that the film also does represent the future in a very dystopian environment, and i thought in its own way, that was a very interesting juxtaposition to put in this film. Although it wasn't as fun and lively as seeing the cleaner future it was definitely interesting to see how greed and a money driven future would look like. Looking back on it now, i would say that the Dystopian representation of the future isn't any more far off than the Cleaner, more technologically advanced one, just saying. But one of the most impressive sequences for me was when Marty and Doc travel back to 1955, the setting of the first film, and have to go around this time period whilst avoiding their other selfs from the first film. This is what really wowed me in terms of the incredible film-making and visual effects that were used in order to make it look like they had actually travelled into the setting of the first film without compromising what the first film set up. The shots were placed perfectly and the use of footage from the first film in combination of recreations of scenes from the first film from different angles was incredible, and for a film released in 1989 it was amazing to see. It also has what i think was the most exciting and fun ending sequence of the series that had me laughing, and in suspense the entire time. It closes off the story of this film perfectly and sets up the next film in a similar way to what the first film did. It may even be one of my favourite movie endings ever, i get goosebumps every time i watch it.Again, the attention to detail was incredible, with fantastic call-backs to the first film and the little details that connect the alternate timelines timelines together, and also some foreshadowing for what is to come in Part 3, Robert Zemeckis' love for this world and these characters is on show. In the end, this film goes bigger, it goes to more places and it retains everything you love about the first film. It does lose some of that magic that you feel when watching the first film but it is still a masterpiece and a classic that even helped to elevate how good the first film was upon return viewings. - 9",

            "content": "Back to the Future Part II begins where Part I left off, in 1985 at the Hill Valley home of teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox, who is an absolute hoot in quintuple roles). Marty's scientist friend, Doc Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd, back again in his signature performance), has just arrived with dire news of the future. So Marty and Doc settle back in the time-hopping DeLorean (you know, the one with the flux capacitor) and the new film skips ahead thirty years to 2015, to find Marty's son, Marty Jr., getting in some trouble with Griff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), the grandson of Marty's 1955 nemesis Biff. This situation resolves itself fairly quickly, but not before old Biff steals the time machine to go back to 1955 and present his teenage self with a copy of a sports almanac that the young man uses to make himself a billionaire, turning 1985 into an altered hellish nightmare fantasy - Marty's dad is dead and Biff Tannen is married to Marty's mom, Lorraine. Marty and Doc, protected somehow from the effects of the change - though for how long, it's hard to say - head to 1955 themselves to stop Biff from changing the time-line. Naturally enough, this leads to both of them interacting, in potentially dangerous ways, with the plot of the first movie.It says quite a lot about director Robert Zemeckis and writer Bob Gale's enduring strengths that what I just wrote makes absolutely perfect sense while you're watching it. And that all the jerry-rigged elements concocted at the end of the movie harmonize rather effortlessly with the original, turning casual gags into clever foreshadowing and building recurring motifs out of one-liners, while also providing a fine story that hangs together and is perfectly effective on its own. It's in 2015 that most of the whiz-bang awesomeness of the movie is found, not just in the staggeringly over-detailed production design - skateboards are replaced by flying hover-boards, the Jaws series is up to number 19 and the Chicago Cubs finally win another series - but in Zemeckis' embrace of technological gewgaws. The film knows just how, and when, to entertain us, and it does so in spades.Zemeckis takes the sequel narrative and splices it into the intricate web of the first feature. The first two Back to the Futures ask a number of unresolved and unresolvable questions about causality, order, and intention; and taken as a pair, they're a hell of a lot of fun. That's what separates a top-drawer talent like Zemeckis from a routine hack: he can make an entertaining trifle meant to sell popcorn, and still infuse it with all kinds of structural inquiry.Back to the Future Part II is simultaneously an entertaining follow-up to Part I and a tantalizing introduction to Part III - a giddily and merrily mind-boggling sci-fi fantasy.",

When I was a kid this was actually my favorite of the series. The whole concept of the future back then is pretty cool. As a second part of a 3 act structure, the film is the darkest one in the series by far, but it's also a lot of fun.The main problem I have with this sequel (and probably the only problem I have with it) is that most of the film is pretty much a homage to the original film. I mean sure, they go to the future and the past and some things that happen are pretty cool, but the people who love this movie is because it's basically the same plot of the first film shown again from a different perspective. A lot of things are just done as a homage to the first film. For example: the Cafe 80's sequence and the entire time they're in 1955.Although I acknowledge it has its problems, Back to the Future Part 2 is a great movie, lots of fun and definitely recommend it.",

Cohen Casey Siemaszko) is funny and Griff's gang (played by Ricky Dean Logan,Spike,Jason Scott Lee) are really cool especially Spike!Elisabeth Shue's Jennifer Parker is really good and yet different than Claudia Wells' Jennifer and it really hard for Me to decide who I like the most as I like how they both performed!I just love the the relationship between the Doc and Marty.Christopher Lloyd is one of My favorite actors of all time and I just love his character and Michael J.

I should mention by the way they re-shot the opening and ending both to make sense with change of actors and match with the previous events. Anyway, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) with his girlfriend Jennifer Parker (Elisabeth Shue, replacing Claudia Wells) have gone with Dr. 'Doc' Emmet Brown (Christopher Lloyd) to 2015, to do something about the kids. In the future, Marty and Jennifer are married with a son with an uncanny resemblance to Marty, and Marty has to change his future so he doesn't get arrested. While looking around, Marty bought a book revealing all winners of every major sport from 1950 - 2000, and old Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) stole it, and changed the 1985 that Marty, Doc and Jennifer (who fainted at seeing her older self) know. To restore their 1985 they have to go back to 1955, coincidently the same day that Marty got back to 1985 before. Trying to recover the sports book from 1955 Biff, after the old one has given it to him, both Marty and Doc have to make sure not to bump into their past selves too. In the end, they succeed, but flying in the stormy sky, Doc in the DeLoreon gets struck by lightning, accidentally sending him back to 1885, back he managed to send a letter to Marty in 1955, so it will continue/conclude. Also starring Lea Thompson as Lorraine Baines/McFly/Tannen, Jeffrey Weissman as George McFly, Titanic's Billy Zane as Match, and look out for young Elijah Wood as Video Game Boy, and Fox playing the McFly daughter, Marlene. The future part is okay, the alternate 1985 is interesting, but for me the only reason to see it is for the 1955 from another angle, and it explains how they get a hover board in the third film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Effects. Worth watching!",

They incorporated, current present, future, new present & past, making the narrative uneven, with a lot of tone shifts.Michael J. Fox puts on another great performance, with his character being more than occupied. Marty is more matured this time around, other than his hilarious, unexplained anger issues. Doc is the same ol' doc, being energetic, yet super witty, just not getting enough screen time he deserves. We also got another dose of Thomas F. Wilson as Biff. Biff was all over this film, being just as active as Marty, and maybe even more than Doc. Even though his character isn't the most creative, he is a very talented actor, being able to play all these roles, in one film, and staying consistent.The screenplay by Robert Zemeckis & Bob Gale again, brought the same witty, and humorous dialogue, while incorporating a few familiar lines.The production design by Rick Carter was beautifully displayed. Carter had a lot on his plate, to perfect all these unique settings, and he completed the task with flying colors.

It's in the nature of sequels to do what has been done successfully before -- only with MORE of it. This one is faster and more packed with incident than \"Back to the Future\" and it ends with a brazen advertisement for the sequel yet to come, \"Back to the Future Part III.\" Poor Marty McFly is flung about through time again and winds up being transferred from 1988 to 2015, which is three years from this writing. Then he's hauled back to 1955 again and we see repeats and variations on the earlier theme. The villain is still the cretinous Biff and the lightning that strikes the town's clock must be figured into the escape. And we still are treated to McFly playing \"Johnny Be Good\" to an astonished audience.It's always interesting to look back at pictures of the future and see what kinds of boats were missed in the predictions. (\"The Shape Of Things To Come\" is amusing to watch today.) The writers haven't done too much with 2015. The good folks of the town wear some plastic clothes and headgear that looks like space helmets, and there are a few jokes about a Ronald Reagan clone welcoming visitors to \"The 80s Cafe.\" The town itself is not transfigured but sports what looks like a pretty and tranquil koi pool in front of the Court House. The MacGuffin is an almanac covering the years 1950 to 2000. If you owned such a document in 1985, McFly's temporal home base, you could do a lot with it.Michael J. Fox is charming in his winsome way and Christopher Lloyd is as loony and manic as ever. Biff is, if anything, more evil than before. He's murderous, demonic. He is defeated, at least for the moment.

            "content": "Back to the Future was never intended to have a sequel but after its huge success they not only filmed a sequel but a third film as well, filmed back to back on a $40 million budget. The film gained $332 million worldwide making it the third highest grossing film of 1989. Part II is directed by Robert Zemeckis and stars Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, reprising their roles of Dr. Emmet Brown and Marty McFly.A lot of people say that this film is their favourite in the series but in my opinion, this is my least favourite. To me, part II just doesn't have the same charm I and III has, not only that but the story is very uneven and unnecessarily jumbled, so much so they have to spoon feed you information so people who don't have a clue what's going on can better understand and as someone who did know what was happening it felt irritating.That doesn't mean there isn't anything good about this film, in fact I just listed all the problems I had with this film, so everything else after this is just positives. We again have a fantastic cast playing great characters, with all the time travel and alternate time lines we get to see a fairly wide range from the actors. The humour is spot on with plenty of reason to laugh.The interpretation of the future was also really interesting, of course we now know it's wrong because it's the past now but it was great to see how accurate it was, and with how unique and different it was from many other interpretations of the future it was great to look at. The costume and set design was brilliant and looked fantastic on screen. The visuals of this film was perhaps one of its strongest parts, from 2015 to alternate 1985 everything looked amazing, the special effects were also well done by the always great industrial light and magic. All intertwined with the once again excellent Alan Silvestri score which, while not as memorable as the first, is still fantastic and suits the film well, building atmosphere and tension.While on the note of visuals, we saw a return of some of the great visual comedy which spiced up the humour from the first film, we also see the return of a lot of shots used in the first film which does tie them together.Overall Back to the Future is a great exciting film with the actors getting a lot of chance to shine. Although messy it's still a lot of fun with hilarious and edge-of-your-seat moments all accompanied by a fantastic score.",

We missed the opening scene (which, as it turns out, was a frame for frame reshoot of the ending of the original Back to the Future) and the credits were rolling on the big screen. I'll never forget soaring through those clouds in that perfect blue sky with that unmistakable and unbeatable theme music blasting. We found our seats and I settled in for 100 minutes of pure escapism, my little brain fully rapt for perhaps the first time. It was then I learned about the joy and, in my opinion, the necessity of doing that, of letting the mind go on an adventure.

The humor had a tiresome elbow-in-the-ribs obviousness to it, the dialog lacked any charm or style and seemed largely devoted to (re-)explaining what was going on right in front of us on the screen (perhaps an aid to the visually impaired?), and the conceptualization of the future never rose above kind of warmed-over Jetsons idiocy (flying cars, video-screen robot waiters, self-tying shoes, hoverboards instead of skateboards, etc.).The fine cast seemed to be almost uniformly phoning it in, making the few who seemed to actually be working at it (Christopher Lloyd, for one) seem incongruous and pathetically out of place, as if they were in a different movie.Incoherent, un-amusing, and utterly pointless.",

            "content": "Darker, faster and with a greater emphasis on thrills and special effects, the second part of the \"Back to the Future\" series is a complete change of pace from the original.  There is still plenty to enjoy here but much of the characterisation and wit of the first film has been lost.Picking up exactly where \"Back to the Future\" left off, Marty (Michael J. Fox) and his girlfriend Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue) travel with Doc (Christopher Lloyd) to Hill Valley in the year 2015 to stop Marty's children from ending up in prison.  While there Marty picks up a sports almanac which, if taken back to the past, could make him rich through placing bets. But things turn complicated when the book is stolen by Marty's arch-nemesis Biff Tannen (Thomas F.Wilson), who runs off with it in the time machine. Returning to much-altered 1985, where a super-rich Biff has married Marty's mother (Lea Thompson) and rules Hill Valley, Marty and Doc must go back to 1955 to destroy the almanac and save the future...The whole film is slickly made, well-paced and contains some well-directed fights and chases.  However, right from the start the story has many problems.  Trying to work out the many time paradoxes in the story is headache-inducing, and the story replaces the careful characterisation of the original with a lot of cartoonish ideas.The 2015 version of Hill Valley is the 80s on steroids, and much of the aging makeup for the characters is too garish and over-the-top to be convincing.  In one scene, Michael J.Fox simultaneously plays the older Marty, Marty's son and (most ludicrously) Marty's daughter.  On a brighter note, this film's kicks off a character arc for Marty that will be resolved in the third film.But most intriguing is the chilling elevation of Biff from simple small-town bully to psychotic, power-hungry arch-villain.  The scenes where he rules Hill Valley from atop his luxury hotel are over-the-top but this doesn't matter too much, courtesy of some good acting by Thomas F.Wilson.  From thereon in, the pace doesn't flag.  The final scenes in 1955, where Marty races against Biff to destroy the book, are spectacularly well-directed and lensed in flawlessly with the events of the original. \nThe acting is variable from so-so to over-the-top, but Christopher Lloyd and Michael J.Fox hold the thing together and stop the plot from becoming completely incomprehensible.After the breakneck speed of this second instalment, the series slows down for it's conclusion in the lighthearted, romantic \"Back to the Future Part III\".  As it is, this is the weakest and least convincing of the trilogy, but it is still an entertaining film provided you don't think about it too much.",

However, taken as a sequel to such a masterpiece, it's a borderline mess. The story is all over the place, needlessly complex, and incredibly silly. Michael J Fox plays himself and his kids in multiple ways, rendering several scenes as little more than ridiculous farce. The lack of the brilliant Crispin Glover as George McFly is obvious throughout too, with the various out of focus stand ins looking just awful. The movie also fails to build to any sort of climax, with it feeling throughout like a collection of random, often bizarre and unrelated sequences which seem to exist purely to show off prosthetic or split camera effects. Compared to the perfect storytelling and character arcs of the original, it's truly staggering that this script ever got approved.If for some reason you've never seen the Back to the Future films, just see the first and skip the awful sequels.",

            "content": "This 1989 sequel to the 1985 film, \"Back to the Future,\" features the continuing adventures of Marty McFly and Doc Brown. In this film, Marty must travel from 1985 to the year 2015 to help his own son. Through an act of carelessness, Marty initiates a chain of events which alters events prior to 1985. Marty and Doc must return to 1955 to repair the damage to their own history.Although entertaining, this second film wasn't quite as good as the first and third films in the series. The character, Jennifer Parker, did little except faint a lot in the movie; so, the inclusion of the character in the story seemed a bit puzzling. The older versions of the characters from the year 2015 were depicted in an over- the-top manner, rendering them somewhat less credible. The future characters seemed more like parodies of the younger versions from the earlier film, which diminished the audience's ability to engage with them on any emotional level. However, the story of the lives of the future characters of this film was intended to be only a backdrop to the more interesting story about Marty McFly, Professor Brown, and Biff from 1985.While this second film was arguably the weakest of the three \"Back to the Future\" films; this film still managed to become a source of interest as it approached the date, October 21, 2015 (the future date depicted in the 1989 film). Audiences of 2015 were amused by some of the film's 26-year-old predictions which proved to be wildly inaccurate. Audiences of the year 2015 also had the opportunity to compare how well the actors had actually aged in real life compared to the way they were artificially aged using makeup and prosthetics in 1989.In spite of its flaws, the second film in the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy still manages to be fun. The film is well paced; and, the time paradox problem is interesting. Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, and Thomas Wilson put in great performances. The film's forecasts of the future as well as its re-creation of scenes from the first film provide points of interest for the audience. The film is a fascinating entry in the trilogy which audiences will enjoy!",

            "content": "I don't think that the first Back to the Future sequel is ultimately much more than an energising romp through the past; the then-present and the then distant future \u2013 an episode in the lives of certain characters during which they must spontaneously react to a predicament and shoot off to try and deal with it in whatever way they can, systematically hopping to and from various eras in the process to formulate an adventure. Indeed, the film's disconnection from the franchise's other two entries lies with the fact the time machine is as much a feature in Part II as anything else compared to the first and third films; the characters therein darting off to varying times on varying equilibriums as opposed to bedding down at a set date and allowing an adventure to play out. Furthermore, it is the only film in the series without a slam-bang finale consisting of racing against time (so to speak) with the potential peril of missing getting back to a specific year at stake \u2013 ending here on a cliff hanger merely teeing up the next entry, thus alluding to proceedings as 'filler' or as an entry detailing an episode or two instead of a rounded adventure. Regardless, the piece works rather well.The film kicks off following the conclusion of the first, the lead in Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, and his newfound idyllic existence post-adventure with a functioning family; enthusiastic girlfriend Jennifer (Shue) and new vehicle shattered by the arrival of his long-standing partner in time Emmett Brown (Lloyd), nicknamed Doc. Doc arrives via the time machine in a frenzied and panicked manner; he has journeyed, as he said he would at the death of the first, far into the future and arrived back to inform Marty and his spouse-to-be that their future children are in big trouble. His outlining of the severity of the situation runs hand in hand with his erratic demeanour and frenzied actions, clearly in a state at the situation thus heightening tension. He speaks whilst systematically refuelling the time machine with household waste, inferring great time has to have been spent completely remodelling the contraption and its power source, a complicated procedure reiterating what a fantastic brain the man is in this respect.After being whisked away and thrust up into air, The Delorean now with the capability of flying, the opening credits greet us with a continual shot that resembles the perspective of an aeroplane's nosecone as it flies through the sky \u2013 a continual composition echoing that of the perspective those within the Delorean might see had the trips for those therein not been instantaneous. Arriving in 2015, Doc outlines Marty's mission in that frenzied manner; the arrival into an eerie new world and the highlighting of what's at stake doing well to further tension as it's established whom he's going up against is the 2015 equivalent to being \"a couple of beers short of a six-pack\", only here involving that of circuit boards. It's said the police and judicial systems work with brutal efficiency, but very little in the way of law is around to break up what is aggravated assault in a diner between Griff (Wilson), Biff's grandson, and Marty, which spills out into the streets and sees him pose as his son to try and quell a future jail term.The film begins in earnest when McFly buys a sports results booklet detailing who will win certain sporting events in the next several decades, for that when he journeys back to his present, he may earn a little extra cash. The idea is hit upon by Doc, demonised and then dismissed before Biff, now as an old man, emerges from the fire exit to a nearby establishment as if some kind of ghostly figure having overheard before taking it upon himself to deliver the book to himself as a youngster man through the Delorean's capabilities. He does so, 1985 Hill Valley eventually re-branded a Las Vegas-inspired, Civil war-torn iconography clad Hell in which Biff rules on high. Here, Biff is Marty's step-father and the consistent pulsating grinds out-poured by background power stations act as ambiguously diegetic sound effects whirring away, neatly capturing the horror of the situation Marty finds himself in; a situation poor Marty needs to have explained to him because \"they\" hit him on the head \"harder than usual\", this time.Thus begins all manner of rather enthralling hijinks, the film undercut with a real sense of both danger and horror as these people toy with time and end up in less than glamorous scenarios; the allure of time travel rife amidst these people and encapsulated in Marty's reaction to peering long-fully down an alleyway towards a busy street in 2015 Hill Valley, wanting to get amongst the residents of the world thirty years on but eventually brought down to Earth with what it is he experiences there-on. On one occasion, Jennifer ends up in her own home thirty years on; the presence of her future daughter mingling around in the background, and in the elevated position of upstairs, complied as if an unearthly creature milling around in a the background of a horror film sequence. Robert Zemeckis directs proceedings with a certain guile, taking the film to some pretty harrowing places on top of some goofy ones that encompasses horse feces and slapstick comedy; yet able to manoeuvre around when a change in tone is required and things become blacker, if more dangerous. Marty and Doc's adventures through the ages ultimately feels a little superficial, if well put together for what it is; but the flip side to this is that if said characters are those of whom we adorn as much as we do and whose company is so pleasing, then what's the problem with spending another 'x' number of hours-and-a-bit minutes in the presence of them and their madcap, rip-roaring misadventures through time and space? My answer: absolutely nothing whatsoever.",

            "content": "With \"Back to the Future\" being such a huge hit in 1985 it was inevitable that a sequel would follow, particularly since the first movie's ending set the stage for it. Released four years later, part two of the planned trilogy contained some memorable moments but failed to match part one's high standard.The main cast from the first movie returned for this outing, with a couple of exceptions. The irreplaceable Crispin Glover (George McFly) was nevertheless replaced, appearing only in footage from the previous movie while another actor played his part in new scenes. Claudia Wells, who played Marty's girlfriend, decided to decline the sequel, which necessitated reshooting the ending scene from the first movie with her replacement (Elisabeth Shue). These losses were unfortunate but at least the bulk of the first movie's well-chosen cast was present.Plotwise, in this case we end up being transported to the future rather than the past. The scenes taking place 30 years into the future (in 2015) are the easily the film's most memorable. There are also scenes that take place in 1955 (during the events of the first film) and in an alternate version of 1985. As before, the main focus is on preventing history from being altered, though they don't seem to be too concerned about tampering with the future. In any case, I find that the story just isn't as compelling as the first movie's, which isn't helped by an ending that mainly just sets the audience up for the concluding chapter of the trilogy.On the technical side, as in the first movie, the direction by Robert Zemeckis is rock solid. The special effects for the 2015 sequences are a bit quaint by today's standards but they're still serviceable. Overall, the movie's production values show the benefit of the generous (but not extravagant) budget.Living up to the original \"Back to the Future\" was not an easy task. While this movie wasn't quite as successful or as enjoyable it still provided enough entertainment to be fondly remembered thirty years later, when its vision of 2015 provides an interesting glimpse into both the past and the future. I haven't seen the concluding film since its original release but my recollection is that it too is worthwhile but, ultimately, inessential.",

(I would like to hear if someone has seen 2 and not the original, and what they thought.) Within minutes Doc, Marty and Jennifer are in 2015 in the now flying DeLorean, a future which just 4 years away from now seems to promise far more than I think we'll see as the 2014 calendar ticks over; flying cars and hovering neon signs to name but two things.In this sequel which covers three distinct time periods, 1955, 1985 and 2015 Marty, Doc and Jennifer \u2013 but mainly Marty and Doc \u2013 must save Marty and Jennifer's as yet unborn kids from less than ideal fates, whilst once again warding off members of the 'Biff' family, including the now elderly Biff himself! Initially it seems and easy mission, but certain events transpire that result in essentially a time travel hijack that alters the course of the past and therefore future.Still with me, just hold on.So Marty and Doc must go BACK to 1955 and re-fix things without impacting their own previous backwards time travel nor their dealings with Marty's future parents or young Biff \u2013 or alternate Doc for that matter.I'm sure that cleared it all up for you! BttF manages to link all that together yet still somehow both make sense and still be entertaining too. Fox again plays multiple relatives as well as multiple Marty's, and it is all held together without CGI by efficient use of camera tricks and false perspectives, a couple of the interactions between the Marty of the original film and the Marty in the sequel are just insanely smart.The film ends on yet another cliffhanger which sets up the threequel in the most blunt fashion that I can recall seeing in cinema, let's just say the film effectively ends with a teaser trailer for BttF 3 \u2013 and as I recall did so when released in the cinema 20 odd years ago.The one thing that sticks out in this film is the proliferation of product placement which was still in its infancy, hence some very clumsy and obvious 'ads' for Pepsi and Pizza Hut. They don't really detract from the film, they just stick out like the tasty pepperoni chunks on the new Extra-Cheez Family Feaster \u0099, that can only be washed down with the newest Pepsi experience, The Fizzmaster \u0099\u0085 sh*t now I'm doing it, I might take a Panadol \u0099 and lie down on my Sleepmaster 3000 \u0099.Final Rating \u2013 8.5 / 10.

I won't spoil the plot but let's just say that he's off to perform a routine task in 2015 but one thing after another happens and just like in the original, the \"fabric of time is threatened\" (Doc's words, not mine-I'm no scientist). So Doc and Marty have to race through time putting things right and having a hard time doing it.Just like the first, there is plenty of humour and action and all the cast are playing their roles great; they look like they're really enjoying themselves.When I first watched this film in 1989 I thought the vision of the future in 2015 was quite cool-it was just how I'd imagine the future to be. Cars that can fly. Flying skateboards. Cool clothes. I hope 2015 is like this.",

The whole thing could have avoided if Doc goes back to the future when Marty buys the sport statistic magazine and just burn it or stop Marty before he buys it. I know if they did that, this movie would have ended there, but then I wanted the writers to sell me harder why Doc couldn't choose the path.Some choices that characters make seem way too questionable and sometimes contrived and it may have convinced the audience back then like I was as a child, but it maybe cringy to watch if you don't take into account that this film was made more than 30 years ago.Another thing is that many characters coexist with themselves at the same moment although that's the last thing you want as a premise. In Biff's case, he even interacts with himself, yet the incident doesn't mess with quantum physics at all.Lastly, Biff is just so horrible as a human being. I mean he's clearly a sociopath. I can't believe how he manages without going to jail. His character should be a bit more redeeming to be entertaining.Fans of Back to the future franchise will enjoy this sequel forever, but if you usually don't enjoy cheesiness of classic films, you may find it just okay.",

It lacks the whimsy of the first installment.  Things seem grimmer, there is even a murder (luckily only heard and read about but nonetheless incongruous to this type of film). 3. Very cutsey commercializations of products like Pepsi, and they are all over the film.  Very obnoxious. 4. An unanticipated problem is their portrayal of how hip and cool the present is (1985), is aging badly.  While in 2015 a scene is filmed in the Club 80s, a 1980s nostalgia club...and now you can't tell what is intentionally or unintentionally camp.

Almost all of us dream of \"time travel.\" BTTF certainly is not the first to explore time travel, but the way it does it is unique. Plus the fact that this is clearly a comedy, but one that is so well conceived and written that I never find myself think of it as a comedy. I've been a long time fan of Chris Lloyd's, and he is so perfect as Doc Brown. And, of course, Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly \"defines\" a role as few have been defined in films. Plus Thomas Wilson as the various Tannen characters, his great characterizations are too easily taken for granted.The Delorean time machine Doc created is the \"vehicle\" that supports three unique stories in the Trilogy. Most of the \"science\" in the 3 films is \"bad science\", which for a scientist makes it even funnier, they don't overlook any details. They always offer a \"science\" explanation for what Doc is about to do, even though it is completely nonsense.In part I, while helping Doc test the time machine in an empty mall parking lot at 2AM, Marty quite accidentally goes back to 1955, to a time where Doc had just discovered the flux capacitor and Marty's eventual parents were to get together at the big high school dance. When Lorraine, again accidentally, gets a crush on Marty he has to repair things to keep from changing his future.In Part II Marty and Doc have to travel to 2015 to keep the future kids out of trouble but a 78-yr-old Biff gets a sports almanac and steals the time machine to give it to his 18-yr-old self in 1955. The resultant gambling and wealth changed history for the worse and Marty and Doc had to use detective work and cunning to set things straight.In part III Marty gets a Western Union letter that Doc Brown had actually written in 1885 and requested delivery at the specific time in the future. Doc has ended up in 1885, is content, and insists that Marty not try to interfere. However, Marty discovers a tombstone and historical account of Doc being shot in the back over an $80 issue. So Marty has to go back and help Doc avoid that fate.To me, thre is no value in judging which of the three movies is \"better\". Each one uses the main characters to create three distinctly different stories. I like to look at them as one long 3-part movie and we periodically watch all three on successive nights. The BTTF films are just great fun, and the good guys always come out on top. And there's nothing wrong with that.In 2015 I bought the 3-disk BluRay set and they really are an upgrade from the DVDs, better picture and sound.",

Alan Silvestri's music for this film is pretty much what it was from the first film (a fitting continuation of the first film if not inspired - wait until Part III for Silvestri's best score of the trilogy!) I really again enjoyed the performances of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, their on-screen interactions are stuff legends are made of.

And when I say good-looking, still seeing the futuristic Hill Valley today still looks amazing, even though it was 1989. The plot, on the other hand, relies on repeating the third act of the first film over again. But it has fun with it, so it's somewhat forgivable. But where the film really shines is in it's writing, especially with the one-liners, the long over-complicated speeches and warnings from Doc, and of course, Biff's screen door on a battleship line.

The entire second act is depressing, as was the intent, and is merely a set up for their return to 1955, again, in the third act. The film starts to come alive in its third act, as they must correct the mistakes in 1955, while trying not to do anything to interfere with their previous trip to 1955. Thomas Wilson's Biff Tannen gets the biggest laughs, while only a few chuckles were heard from the audience here and there. Sequel has a very imaginative and original plot, but it's just not fun, or funny. Before part II showed (again on Back To The Future day, 21 October 2015) a couple of mock ads were shown, one for a Hoverboard, and a trailer for the fictitious Jaws 19.

It's just it hasn't taken the time as well as the first film.Biggest draw back are the special effects, the flying cars, which are far too clearly just that: special effects.

You really could tie your brains into a knot, if you would think about them seriously for a while.The film starts right from where the first one ended: Marty (Fox), Doc (Christopher Lloyd) and Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue) go in the future to stop their kids to be from goofing around.

Fox as Marty McFly, a teen from 1985 who travels to 2015 with Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) on his time machine. When they return to 1985 they discover that an item was inadvertently taken from 2015 and brought to 1955, which changed history and made Hill Valley a dystopia. So they frantically venture back to 1955 to try to correct the problem. Crispin Glover & Lea Thompson play Marty's parents while Thomas F. Wilson plays the villain, Biff. Elisabeth Shue replaces Claudia Wells as Marty's girlfriend, but she's asleep most of the movie.This is almost as good as the first movie, but the goofy tone of the first act throws it off, although it's action-packed. The next two acts are better as Marty & Doc go back in time and cleverly try to fix things. While the plot is way more complicated than the first film it's surprisingly easy to follow (Doc effectively explains the logistics in one scene). However, it's mandatory that you watch the first movie to fully appreciate this one. It can be argued that the movie was overly optimistic about the future (that is, 2015), but it was surprisingly accurate with some things, like video phones and, to some degree, hover-boards. But since the 'future' shown in the movie (2015) is a timeline manipulated by the protagonists it's an ALTERNATE reality and not necessarily the way things panned out in reality. It was Doc himself who invented the technology for flying automobiles since he already created the flying DeLorean in the first movie.The film runs 108 minutes and was shot in Oxnard, Monrovia, Arleta, Whittier, Baldwin Park, South Pasadena, Pasadena, Universal City and Los Angeles, California.

This one begins where the first film left off with Marty McFly connecting with his girlfriend and Doc Brown flying in on his time machine car informing them that their future son is in trouble. They shoot ahead into the future through s sky traffic and this is where the film is at its best with gangs pursuing on hover boards, TVs that act as phones, and a sports book that comes into play when its rightful predictions land in the wrong hands. While the screenplay is creative the ending is flawed in its willingness to shove the third film at viewers as oppose to celebrate the second film. Michael J. Fox as Marty is seen on screen within several different version of himself whether future or past. Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown juggles time lines warning Marty not to interact with his future self. Elisabeth Shue is brought in to play Marty's girlfriend who marvels the future until Brown zonks her to sleep. Thomas F.

The look of the futuristic world is incredible and the look of the 1950's is also great! There really isn't enough good things I can say about this movie!  It's absolutely incredible.SPOILERS AHEADThere is one complaint/question I have though, if Biff got a hold of the Almanac and Time Machine in 2015, went back to 1955 to give himself the Almanac, and then went back to 2015 to return the time machine to Marty and Doc Brown...wouldn't he be in a different 2015?  I guess it can be argued that Marty, Jennifer and Doc would still be at their future house regardless of the world changing around them due to Biff's traveling through time, but I don't know, I guess it just didn't sit right with me.  I hope what I'm trying to say makes sense.  Time travel is such an \"unstable\" subject, there are so many paradox's that can occur.  But anyhow, I'm not going to let this one little plot point ruin the whole movie for me.  It's still a great movie and should definitely be seen.One other thing I'd like to say is that the ending of this film is without a doubt my favorite ending of any movie I've ever seen.  What I mean by this is when Marty is in 1955 and finds out that the 'Doc' is still alive in the 1855 and realizes that he knows exactly where the 1955 Doc is, he goes to ask for his help.  The actual scene in particular that I'm talking about is when Doc sends Marty into the future due to the lightning storm and then Marty comes running down the street and says that he needs his help again. I just LOVE that scene, I think it's such a cool scene and leaves you dying to see Part III.If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favor and go see it, and if you haven't seen the first in the series, then see that first.

            "content": "I'm such a fan of the first film of this series that I feel compelled to address the problems of the second.  Leave it to me to only focus on the negative.  **CONTAINS SPOILERSFirst of all, the plot is much more complicated.  Sub-plots begin here and end in the 3rd movie; a result of filming the last two films back-to-back. With so much info to cram in, the dialogue becomes weighted down with too much explanation.  As a result, it sounds forced and unnatural.  The scene in the McFly's future Hilldale home comes to mind.  In this one glimpse into their daily family life, we learn that Marty wrecked his life in a Rolls-Royce accident and that his lifelong inability to back down from a dare (a particularly horrible and corny plot device -- \"Chicken?\") causes one ridiculously bad decision after another.  Of course, Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer, overhears it all along with Marty's termination and his terrible guitar playing.  Very convenient, indeed.Secondly, while the story at times can be nicely constructed, some parts are lazily thrown together.  Right off the bat, Doc arrives in broad daylight to pick up Marty and Jennifer to take them to the future.  Why on earth would they have to leave right away?  They could plan for weeks and the same future would still be waiting for them.  Later, Doc says he brought Jennifer because he couldn't leave her with the information of having seen the time machine.  Who wouldn't have noticed a flying Dolorean take off from the street and implode in a ring of fire in the sky?  Apparently, we're supposed to believe that the only one left behind to notice is Biff, who had come out to (get this) show Marty his new matchbooks.  It seems the writers hadn't anticipated picking up from the epilogue of the first film and they couldn't think of a believable way to continue from there.  It doesn't end there. Why leave an unconscious Jennifer on crates in an alley?  Isn't there room in the car or ANYWHERE else?  Are we to believe that Old Biff could figure out how the time machine works: the control panel, Mr. Fusion, and the 88mph thing?  And I might as well point out that Marty appeared about 40 yards away from the car when it was stolen and replaced.  How did Doc know to pick up Marty on the roof of Biff's building?  Why does young Biff turn from misunderstood bully to an all-out psychotic, screaming after Lorraine, \"It's meant to be?\"  Are you telling me that Doc couldn't land the time machine after dropping Marty off during the lightning storm?  Please!  The writers had to leave him flying around so he'd get struck by lightning and that's exactly what I thought as I was watching, and I hate thinking like that when I watch a movie!On the plus side, the film does get better when Marty and Doc return to 1955.  The quest for the Sports Almanac is a good one, turning up some nail-biting sequences.  Best of all are the revisited scenes from the first film.  It's a blast to see Marty sneak around the fringes of the action we know so well to achieve different ends.  Then again, perhaps these scenes worked best because I temporarily thought I was watching the much better first film.Grade: C-",

It's only when they make their way back into the past again that things begins to improve and the film starts regaining its lost touch. The third act is its saving grace.The futuristic set pieces don't exude the same level of excitement that sci-fi relics of the first film did, and the dystopian present they return to is an overkill as well. The premise is nonetheless interesting, expertly structured and the way it merges with previous chapter's events is riveting to watch. Performances are a step down this time around but still serviceable.Overall, Back to the Future II has its share of negatives and exhibits shortcomings of its own making but it still offers a blockbuster extravaganza that many viewers won't complain about. While much more ambitious than the first film, this follow-up chapter fails to execute it all with same finesse as before, and is an inferior end product that finds its sure footing only in the final act.",

It does cover a lot ground previously made by the classic original, but from a different and enjoyable perspective.The plot contains many recycled elements from the first movie but it continues the story well and puts its own unique stamp on Doc and Marty's adventure through time in Hill Valley.As with most sequels the action and spectacle is ramped up considerably with with lots more time travel and versions of the town to see. This works well, particularly in the initial 2015 scenes where we see Marty take in sights of what was then a far off look into the future. Now we are in 2021, these scenes have an additional amusement with their flying cars, hoverboards and various other future tech concepts.When disaster strikes the space time continuum, the stakes get a lot higher, more engaging and we get invested in Marty's mission to put things right. Everything ends on a great cliffhanger that makes you eager to know what comes next.This is a very visual movie that tells a story well through camerawork. It also delivers a lot more of humour through sight gags than the original. The production values are immensely high with special effects that were top class at the time of production. These all hold up well on present day viewings.All performances are excellent with a number of great multi-character/age portrayals. Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd lead the cast superbly, but for me the star of the show is Thomas F Wilson who plays old Biff, two incarnations of middle-age Biff, young Biff and the wonderfully loony Griff. He is fantastic in every scene.For me it is an 8.5/10 but I round upwards.",

            "content": "Since Part II and Part III of this franchise were shot together does that mean we can refer to it as Back to Back Back to Back to the Future?The paradoxes don't end there. They've not even begun yet. The fact that Part II contradicts the laws of 4-dimensional physics laid down in the first movie is not a problem unless you want it to be. There are a lot of wannabe smart-asses out there who think they are overnight geniuses for picking plot holes in Part II. Robert Zemeckis has said that it is the most complex film he has ever made. I think that the complicated nature of the story, the dark middle act, and abrupt cliffhanger perhaps alienate some of the more simple viewers and that has led to Part II being the most underrated and misunderstood of the series.It's also my favorite for those exact reasons, and more.Like the first movie Part II is an icon of a now past future. It may have got some predictions laughably incorrect but it did get many frighteningly accurate. Video phones came true, hover- boards entered pop culture, and a madman with bad hair became the most powerful man in the world. But since this all exists in a timeline manipulated by Marty and Doc it is all in its own universe and therefor plausible. Who's to say that it wasn't Doc Brown himself who invented the technology of flying cars.With the distractions of visual effects, action scenes, and complex stories it is easy for one to forget that the Back to the Future movies are comedies. It is my personal opinion that Christopher Lloyd and Crispin Glover were robbed of Academy Awards in 1986 (does anyone give a crap about William Hurt in Kiss of the Spider Woman or Don Ameche in Cocoon?). They were not even nominated. Doc Brown and George McFly are characters that stay with you. However, Part II is Thomas F. Wilson's time to shine and he absolutely dominates this movie. Biff Tannen is my favorite character of the series - a lunkhead bully, cruel just for the sake of being cruel, who is so dumb that even his older self is bemused by his stupidity. While Marty and Doc are the leads it is Biff who is the comedic heart of the series.There are weakness though. Silvestri's score for this entry is the worst of the series - full of underscoring and tension with very little in the way of excitement outside of the opening and closing credits. I'm not entirely satisfied with Doc's silly \"it's just a big coincidence\" explanation for old Biff going back to November 5th 1955 either. I know it' supposed to be a joke but I think a smarter reason would be that the date would have been stored in the time circuits and Biff simply selected it because it seemed appropriate. But I'm being far too pedantic.The best scene in all of the Back to the Future movies is without a doubt the lightning striking the clock tower while Marty and Doc struggle to send the 1.21 gigawatts into the flux capacitor. The editing and timing of this is absolutely perfect down to the last frame. Not only do we get to experience it again in Part II but it even continues with the other Marty interrupting Doc's celebration. I first saw this movie in Summer 1990 while on a long plane journey so the trailer for Part III at the end wasn't so much a tease for me. I only had to wait about a week before I was sitting in the cinema watching it.Fun times. If only I could go back and relive it again...",

Mind you, I thought that it was pretty good, though there are suggestions that one of the main areas where it seems to fall down is that for about the third of the film they seem to just rehash everything that occurred in the first film. Okay, they sort of suggested that the era in which the first film was set is some sort of time junction, but in reality, it probably had more to do with Biff not really knowing which time to go back to and just picking a random time.The film basically begins where the previous film left off, and the previous film did drop hints that there was going to be a sequel, just as this one drops hints, well not really a hint because the ending is pretty blatant, that this is going to be a trilogy. Yeah, this is the middle film (but you probably already know that), and as such it doesn't sort of stack up to where the other films shine.I guess the main reason is that they seem to be jumping around a bit, and also the fact that there are some problems with the time line. Like, one would have thought that if Biff went back and changed everything, then Marty wouldn't have been able to initially go back, particularly since the old Biff told the young Biff to watch out for a kid, and a mad scientist, which meant that Doc ended up getting locked up, which meant that there would have been no way to send Marty back in time. Yeah, that's sort of what happens when you don't sit down and think through time travel paradoxes.Still, I like this film, it is pretty engaging, particularly since this time they do attempt to change the timeline, which results in some disastrous consequences. Previously, it was all accidental, whereas this time it is on purpose. It also creates a pretty dystopian Hill Valley, which I thought was rather cool. They also spend a decent amount of time here as well. As for the future, well, we all remember Back to the Future Day, which happened something like 5 years ago, and it is interesting to see what they got right, and what they didn't. Yeah, no hoverboards or flying cars, but we do have smarthouses, and big screen TVs where you can watch multiple channels at once.Yeah, this is a pretty cool movie, especially if you don't take it too seriously, which is something that I suspect that you aren't supposed to do.",

Basically it threw a spanner in works right away when they jump forward to sort out Marty and Jen's kids. By the Doc coming back and getting them into the car and TAKING THEM OUT THE TIMELINE what did he think he'd find when he got to the Future.The basis was sent in the previous film when he jumped the DeLorean forward at Twin Pines Mall with the dog in it, the dog physically left the timeline to reappear 1 minute later. So by taking Marty and Jen out the timeline they should have appeared in 2015 with a changed scenario from Doc's perspective then that would have been the face palm DOH!!!! moment.The future tech was good Hover Boards the Nike Mags etc but then they went back and forth and it got all a bit muddy and busy story wise. When dealing with time film makers always over speculate progress of technology, The classic Blade Runner done this also, we're only 2 years away from 2019 and no where near the Technology suggested in the movie but that movie can be forgiven as it's so bloody good.This however is a film I can't be bothered to watch again, the other two yes but this one not really",

            "content": "Although it is not as good as the original movie in my view, the sequel \u0091Back To The Future II' is a movie that fans of the genre will always enjoy. What is fun about this movie is how totally crazy that the whole idea behind it really was. However it is also interesting to once again visit the classic story that the two Bobs have been made famous for writing. There are other interesting aspects to this film, but if I tell you too much too soon, we might do some irreparable damage to the \u0091space time continuum'.Brace yourself \u0096 as the most spectacular history-altering adventure of all time continues. Marty and Doc Brown have barely recovered from their first time-travelling adventure when they launch themselves once more into the space time continuum. But this time around, their history-tweaking antics in the year 2015 create a frightful, alternate 1985 Hill Valley where bully Biff Tannen is rich, powerful and Marty's Dad! Now, their only chance to fix the present is by going back to 1955 all over again. But can Doc and Marty patch up the past without igniting a universe-shredding time paradox?\nWhat is most impressive about the second of the BTTF films is the story that was thought up by Bob Zemeckis and Bob Gale. Many sequels are entirely different sorts of movies, but in this one, the writing pair have cashed in on what was successful in the first and cleverly integrated that into the second. If I was to tell you what the main parts to the story were, it would get both of us very confused. Another remarkable part to this movie is the way the future is presented here. The movie partly takes place in 2015, so I am sure back in the 1980s, the ideas of what the future would be like in the new millennium were quite outrageous. Yet for a film such as this they are the perfect ideas to present. Of the changes to Marty's home town Hill Valley in 2015, they include vehicles which can fly through the sky and kids who have skateboards that operate as \u0091hovercrafts'. In fact the movies special effect highlights include all of the scenes with these \u0091hovercrafts', with Marty evading a bad gang in the centre of Hill Valley. Marty and Doc Brown (Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd) are back in very entertaining roles. Fox takes on more than the role of 17 year old Marty McFly from 1985. He is also his son Marty Jnr., the older Marty (the father of the family) and his daughter Marlene. Fox commented that the process of being the many different characters was an arduous task, but one that makes the whole BTTF experience worth it. Yet the standout role in BTTF 2 has to be Lloyd, who as the Doc has many headaches when he goes from the future, the present and the past. He is breathless as he flies about trying to repair the damage that is caused to the \u0091space time continuum'. Many times I had to laugh as the Doc is rambling on about what chaos has been caused by the latest disaster.There are other reprising roles that are most noteworthy in BTTF 2. Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) is back, as is his older version in the year 2015, along with his grandson Griff, who is as much a \u0091butthead' as his grandfather was at his age. In fact going back to see Biff as a billionaire and a teenager was even more enjoyable this time around, as he is the tough guy that Marty McFly does not like. There is also Marty's mother Lorraine (Lea Thompson), who is very old in 2015 and placed into a horrible life when the present is ruined by her son. I feel that she was a great choice for this role and I am glad she came back. A new actor to the cast is Karate Kid and Leaving Las Vegas star Elizabeth Shue, who is Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer. Her role in the movie is funny as she is taken on a ride that will show her future.\nBeing behind the scenes of this movie must have been a nightmare, as you would not have known where you were from one day to the next. Perhaps that is the reason that this movie would have been so much fun to work on. I like what this movie points out about the past and the future. It shows you can go into the future and straighten out what little idiosyncrasy that you or your family might have. But it also shows what damage can be caused to the present, when one mistake is made. \u0091Back To The Future II' might not be as classy as the original movie, but what it lacks it in originality, it makes up with in comedy and humour.  With that in mind, fans of the series would have to be happy with a most satisfying of sequels.CMRS gives \u0091Back To The Future II': 4 (Very Good Film)",

And he more or less succeeds in doing that. However, what happens next is where the plot really takes off: Marty buys a sports almanac with statistics from 1950-2000 in it, simply to take back with him to 1985, and use it to 'place a couple bets'. But not if Doc has anything to say about it! Doc throws it away immediately, reminding Marty that that's not what he built the time machine for. So what's the problem? Seventy-seven year old Biff Tannen overhears that whole conversation! So what does he do? Exactly what 17 year old and 47 year old Biff would do: he takes the book from the trash can, steals the DeLorean, goes back in time, and gives the book to young Biff and tells him exactly what to do with it. How Doc and Marty find out about all this is far to interesting to reveal. And there are still a few surprises after that, but I think I may have already gone too far.So the bottom line for \"Back to the Future Part II\" is this: no, it's not as good as the original. The primary reason is the fact that the first 30-40 minutes or so are just too 'gimmicky', with too many little jokes about what the year 2015 will be like in Hill Valley. However, it's the second half of the movie that's really worth watching, as Marty and Doc travel all over time, trying to put Hill Valley and everyone in it back to normal. Another reason to see this is simply so you can watch \"Back to the Future Part III\", which is even better than this one (really).",

Instead he takes Marty to prevent it from present time and his gf for no reason. All this while doc knows how much time travel can alter the present. He immediately puts the gf out when the journey begins, leave her on the street in the future, fun scene takes place And when they return to get her she is being picked up by police, doc now knows the police of the future will think Marty is the Marty of the future so instead of stopping her apprehension they just stand there even though Marty could had intervened right there. Then doc and Marty are completely careless with the time machine and who they are interacting with. The same biff has now seen Marty in the past present and future yet they don't avoid him at all.

This despite Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale thinking they finished the first film perfectly well. But despite this they continued with their baby and explained on the original idea.Back to the Future Part II begins with the last scenes of the first film, with Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) taking Marty (Michael J. Fox) and his girlfriend Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue) to 2015. Doc Brown wanted Marty to save his son and family from disaster. But whilst in the future, a 77-year-old Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) sees them and their time machines. Whilst on their mission he goes back to 1955 and his younger self a book of sports statistics. When 'Doc' and Marty return to 1985 they discover history has changed, with Biff becoming a multi-billionaire, controlling Hill Valley and married Marty's mum Lorraine (Lea Thompson). Marty and Doc have to return to 1955 and destroy the book and do it without interfering with Marty's first trip.They is no way Back to the Future Part II could ever match the first film with originality or wit, but it is still a fun little film. Robert Zemeckis shows his skills as a special effects director and for making fun family films with warmth and passion. He knows he has a tough job on his hands and just makes the film fun, mixing comedy and action with great effort. Zemeckis and Gale explain on ideas that the first film set up about time travel and parallel time lines which have continued into further films, TV series and cartoons. Zemeckis was also able to mix new scenes with scenes from the first film to great effort and has some of the best comedic moments in the film. I also enjoyed the scene between the two Docs. They is also a good joke about the Jaws Series. Zemeckis also copies what Steven Spielberg did with Indiana Jones, making the second film darker to the first. This doesn't work but I give the director points for trying. Fox, Lloyd and Wilson also enjoy the roles they are in, all are very good in the series. The Back to the Future series is possibly Fox's best work as an actor.A perfectly enjoyable film",

Unlike the first one, the really cool part of the movie is when he used those hover-boards. The real foe in this movie is Biff(Thomas F. Wilson), Marty's father's nemesis. Going to the future was fine, so when he went back to 1985, something was wrong. The Hill Valley he knows wasn't the way it was. His house was occupied by another family, and his neighborhood is a crime-zone. The time has been altered, by Biff. the source of the change, The Sports Almanac. The solution, go back to 1955. It was funny when young Biff crashed his car into a manure truck. Thanks to the hover-board, the future of the McFly legacy is safe. This movie got a lot of characters, and Michael J.

For a start, the special effects and the visions of the future were imaginative and carefully planned.  Michael J Fox and Christopher lloyd are still adorable in their respective roles.  Although the rest of the cast, with the exception of Biff have little to do.  The scenes for 1955 are just a rehash of the first, but there is very little that they actually could have done to prevent that.  I thought they integrated the new characters into the old scenes quite well, in keeping with the original story from part 1.  Obviously well planned.  Because the end runs directly into part 3, part 2 was necessary for part 3 to occur.  It is a filler in a way which was made into a film of a sort.  My Conclusion, although its not as engaging as 1 or 3, it's still a worthy part of the trilogy.",

            "content": "I was shocked when I first saw it. Since I'm not another fan of (Back to the Future - 1985), rather I'm in love with it, I expected something as great. But I was wrong. Because this is a cheap profiteering out of it and nothing more!The writing is the only criminal here. It's clear how they tried desperately to make up anything for a sequel after the success of the first. So they exhausted themselves very much to fabricate this one, with so many time-games and reediting for the first one's main events. While the more original, less exploitative efforts were saved for the third installment.The script tries to invent whatever fits the (Back to The Future)'s title, so the leads must do what they do, on one condition; ending with coming back to the future. Look at this plot: We got to see the future, then we return to the present to find it destroyed because someone of the very future went to the past earlier so he destroyed the actual present, hence the leads had to go back to the past to repair it, then go BACK TO THE FUTUER. This is what makes the difference between the first movie as \"creation\" and the second as \"utilization\"!Except the almanac factor, nothing could have happened in the first place. Originally, this sequel itself looks like almanac for the first movie's world, and all what they did was messing with it! The scenes of the first (Back..) are reused during the first and third acts (the restaurant's mess, the action after, the home's talking, the 50s party..) with only new clothes. I was between sick and embarrassed due to endless \"Don't meet your other self\" matters. Actually, the repeating of \"This is heavy\", \"A deja-vu\", and maybe \"I'll destroy the time-machine\" could mirror the movie makers' real weariness out of the manipulation that they were doing to their fine work!There was trite point like how (Biff) confesses all about his secrets to his wife's son easily! But this is nothing compared to a huge plot hole I noticed; when the old (Biff) stole the car, along with the almanac, then went into the past, he came back to \"his\" future to find it totally unharmed??!! It's intuitive, and according to the movie's logic as well, that when he traveled, he already changed the time, so he would return to totally another future; the future of him as rich in rotten city, not coming back to his own time in the same neighborhood as if he rode the time-machine along the blocks!And to make it worse and worse; it missed the substance. The first contains a sort of romantic comedy about girl-loves-boy and this boy-doesn't-love her so he-goes-to-unite-her-with-another, not to mention a message about being active; taking the right decision in the right time to fulfill it. The third part got a love story too where the doc falls in love; that's a character development to remember passionately. Simply, that what gives the movie, any movie, a serious place in our hearts. However, this poor one got nothing of this sort. Why they didn't give every sequel a certain meaning or lesson? It's how movies didn't age badly, or age at all.Anyway, it managed to be somehow solid and entertaining all along, yet as a huge comic book which's surely less important and more puffy than the other 2 movies. So, eventually, when it comes to love; what could be really loved from it? Well, it's easy; the funny details of the future, (Elisabeth Shue) as the new (Jennifer), and seeing the characters of the original hit ride again.. But not quite hit again!",

            "review_title": "Hobbled by trying to fulfill the joke ending from the first movie",
            "content": "The two Bobs painted themselves into a narrative corner with their jokey ending to the first Back to the Future movie. They had no intention of ever making another one, so the tag at the end was just for giggles. But, the first movie was hugely successful and Universal threw money at the two Bobs until they relented and made another pair of movies. So, saddled with a throwaway line about Marty's kids and taking his girlfriend along, the two Bobs realized that they were in a jam. Dealing with Marty's kids kind of went against everything Doc had been about up to that point and Jennifer was pretty much dead weight considering the dynamic between Marty and Doc. They were trapped, and they decided to deal with it head on.And I think that's where this movie's problems lay. The opening forty minutes of the movie is spent justifying the final jokey stinger at the end of the first movie, and it's a laborious set up for the actual plot of the movie. Other than Marty buying a future almanac, very little of what happens has any bearing on the events of the rest of the movie. More time is actually spent setting up things for the third movie, which ends up making the first third of Back to the Future Part II feel like the opening act of another movie. Other than the sports almanac, almost nothing of what happens in the first third of the film has any bearing on the rest of the film.So, Doc brings Marty and Jennifer to 2015 and immediately regrets bringing Jennifer. So, he knocks her out with a futuristic thing, and moves to get Marty to replace his son who is going to agree to a robbery with Griff, Biff's grandson, and go to jail which will tear the family apart in the further future. So, using time travel to make Marty's life better, which he promptly chastises Marty for when he wants to bring a sports almanac back and make some money in the past to make his life better. After Marty goes through a repeat of his skateboarding scene from the first movie, this time with hover boards, the elderly Biff figures out that Doc has invented a time machine and picks up the almanac that Marty bought and Doc forced him to throw away. After a quick detour because Jennifer got picked up by the cops and taken to her future home, Biff steals the DeLorean, goes back and time, and returns the time machines (why?) to this version of 2015 (despite what Doc later says about traveling forward from an alternate timeline) before falling out of frame in apparent pain.This first act is a mess. It makes little logical sense and it just doesn't fit the final two acts. There are certainly joys to it, though. The vision of the future is interesting with wonderful touches like the Jaws 19 movie stuff, but that feels like a missed opportunity. I don't know if the two Bobs bandied around the idea of skipping forward for the start of the story, maybe covering some of the action with some quick dialogue instead, but as it stands the first forty minutes of this movie is kind of a chore.Once the plot of the movie clears up and solidifies, though, the movie is far more entertaining. The movie gains a new goal (again, about forty minutes in) and it charges ahead. With Biff having become a millionaire through betting from the 50s on, 1985 has changed dramatically. Biff has taken over Hill Valley, the sleepy little town, and turned it into a gambling centric hellhole with his tower at the center. George is dead, and Loraine has married Biff. Marty, who's supposed to be in Switzerland, shows up and gets a rude awakening at this new reality. Doc figures out what went wrong based on some clues left in the DeLorean and decides that the only course of action to fix everything is to go back to 1955.Revisiting the 1955 story from another perspective was never the two Bobs' first choice. They originally wanted to go back to 1965 and see the flower children version of Marty's parents. I suppose the decision to not rehire Crispin Glover to play George (because Crispin Glover is a crazy person) played into that narrative change of course. So, we get a rather amusing look at time travel with a heavier emphasis on potential paradoxes.Once again, the goal is clear. Marty needs to get the almanac back but he can't let his past self or his parents see him (why he can't wait for Biff to fall asleep and steal it from his room is less clear, the time limitations don't really exist in this movie). So, he navigates the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance, intersecting with the previous film's actions in entertaining ways. He has to sneak by his past self in the car with his mother. He gets to watch his father's grand moment in a way that he didn't before, just as he steals the almanac from Biff's pocket. He has to save his past self from Biff's goon friends just off stage of past Marty playing \"Johnny Be Good\". It's solid, entertaining stuff, though it often feels easier than the first film (like the three goons happening to stand under some easily released sandbags).The film ends triumphantly and then tragically and then with a cliffhanger (and then a tease of the third film that I'm honestly very happy Universal keeps including on home releases) all in quick order, and the movie's overall light tone lets it bounce from one emotion to another without much trouble. These movies are meant to be fun, not deeply felt, so it allows for these jumps more easily. Sure we can feel sad at the sudden disappearance of Doc and the DeLorean after it gets struck by lightning, but the movie was never going for tears at any point so it functions more as shock than tragedy.Back to the Future Part II stumbles in the beginning and then lightly recovers by the end. It's an amusing continuation of the series has some fun visuals along the way (this seems to be the first real instance of Zemeckis falling in love with the technology, even more so than in Who Framed Roger Rabbit). It's a near miss for me overall, though. The first act just feels way too disassociated from the rest of the film, feeling more like a precursor to Part III rather than the final two-thirds of Part II, for me to ignore. There's definitely fun to be had, for sure, but I just hoped for more.",

The original film had time-travel interwoven into its story, but when watching the original film it always felt, at its core, that being fun was at the forefront of the picture.Don't get me wrong BTTF part 2 is still fun, but it feels much more overloaded than the first film (the time-travel aspect is much more complex and takes a bit of time to get your head around) and it felt to me that a more expansive story has taken some of the fun away from proceedings. Like I say, this isn't a big issue and BTTF part 2 is still a laugh, but I don't think it has the rewatchability value that the first film has.Still one thing that doesn't disappoint here are the main cast who are arguably better in this film than the first; both Michael J Fox and Thomas Wilson take on more than 1 role and both actors are on top form here - although Thomas Wilson's contribution is once again far more memorable. These scenes are fun, but unfortunately they only exist as narrative devices to move the story along and come thick and fast and some of these brief scenes are the best parts of the film. Like I say the central concept is fine and the film is still good fun, but it never quite manages to match the quality of the first film which managed to have slightly more fun with a story that was also slightly more endearing.Whilst BFF2 deserves some credit for offering a deeper and more expansive plot sometimes they say that less is more...",

Today, a mere four years removed from the distant year 2015 depicted on the screen, those predictions seem more like a creative writing essay from the science fiction magazines of the 1950s. They remain endearing and entertaining, but in a different way - the jokes still work, but the more serious elements either don't play or, worse, come off as pure camp. And, with the shiny veneer of that potential future relegated to nothing more than a running series of sight gags, the holes and flaws of the plot itself find themselves stripped bare. It came as something of a shock to me, given my fond memory, but this really is not a good film. What screen time the cast doesn't spend breathlessly explaining the plot (which is, perhaps, fifty percent of the film) is devoted to revisiting several of the best scenes from the first movie, rather than creating fond memories of their own. It's an overly elaborate story, unashamedly building to the simultaneously-filmed follow-up, that has neither the steady pace nor the genuine charm of the original. Plot holes the size of a steam engine are the least of its concerns, given that the first film managed to be such a success in spite of similar problems.",

The acting, direction, music and the wacky way in which the Doc and Marty have to jump through time to solve a problem.With that said, which isn't saying much, it is a worthy sequel.

Marty learns that his father was killed a few years ago and his mother is now married to Biff. Marty meets with Doc who thinks he knows what happened. Somehow Biff got his hands on a book from the future which has in it all sports results and he used it to bet on sports and amass his fortune. Marty said he considered doing that but Doc nixed it. Somehow the Biff from the future discovered about the time machine and Marty's plan and used the time machine to give his younger self the book. So they have to find out when Biff got the book so they can take it away from him. So Marty goes to see him and confronts him about it and Biff also tells him that he was the one who killed George. Marty and Doc then go back to, of all places, 1955 on the day of the school dance. So Marty tries to get the book while trying to avoid being seen by Doc's younger self and himself who's getting ready to go back to 1985. Marty at times gets the book but when Biff calls him a coward, Marty gets incensed which leads to him losing the book so he has to try and get it again.I will quickly say that in order to understand this film you definitely need to watch the first one as it picks up where it left off.This film was definitely an excellent sequel to the first film, heck even better as we got to actually go to the future.The acting was still good and so was the music.All and all excellent sequel.",

The first film leveled itself out with excellent pacing, and heart where it needed it. The movie is fast paced, but it's the right level of it, and gives itself time to cool down with scenes of dialogue. This movie starts, and it keeps going till it's over. This is one of the fastest paced movies ever, with a lot of stuff happening. There is no time to cool down in this movie as it keeps it's pace for almost two hours! With that said, it's still pretty effective as a sequel!Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) and his girlfriend Jennifer (Elizabeth Shue) travel forward in time to 2015 with Doc Brown (Christopher LLoyd) so Marty can help prevent his future son from becoming a criminal. After several occurrences, some caused by Marty himself, Biff Tannen (Thomas F Wilson) has his hands on both a sports statistics book that gives stats through 2000, and on the Delorean. After going back to 1985 where Biff is the richest man in Hill Valley owning a huge casino, is married to Marty's mother (Lea Thompson), and Marty's father is dead. What ensues is a trip back to the 50s to stop this ever from happening.This movie has some really impressive sets. 2015 Hill Valley is a great set, and an excellent variation on the 1985 and '55 version. The Biff hotel set is another really cool looking and impressive set, and everything about the settings of this movie are really atmospheric. Normally this is something you don't even notice about movies, but here the aesthetics are a real positive.The movie starts off really well, and the ridiculously fast pacing isn't a problem. Set piece 2015 is fast paced, fine, then we get back to the fast paced 1985 Biff takeover, which is fine. It's once we get back to the 1950s where this movie becomes somewhat tedious and despite it's quick pace, it grows slightly boring. The zaniness is here more than in the first movie too. The Doc is zany, Marty is zany, Biff is zany...in fact, everything is so slapstick and silly it grows somewhat annoying. Even the scene that the trailer eagerly showed off Michael J Fox playing Marty, future Marty, Marty Jr., and Marlene McFly is sort of annoying because every character in the scene is really loud, like each character is trying to one up the last one. And that's one of the major problems in this movie is how loud every character is. Constant yelling does not mean hilarious performances.The acting, despite being too over the top at times is as good as the first. Thomas F Wilson plays a pretty convincing bad guy, and definitely knows how to be evil well. Michael J Fox and Christopher LLoyd also give excellent performances, along with the ensemble cast.Overall, this is a very good sequel. It's not up to par with the first, and grows annoying at times, but it's still an excellent second part to an excellent trilogy.My rating: *** out of ****. 110 mins, PG for language and violence.",

I enjoyed rewatching the film, but my main complaint is that this sequel lacks the heart of the original film and was overly plot driven. It's still funny, suspenseful, and exciting, but it didn't have the innocent charms of the original. For that reason, it's the weakest of the trilogy, but it's still well worth watching. FUN FACT!

            "content": "Back to the Future is one of the most influential films in cinema history, marking a generation and expanding its success to this day. Owner of an original plot and revolutionary effects for the time, the plot's popularity reached levels rarely seen in cinema. Originally, the idea of screenwriters Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis was just to close the film with an anecdote, a way to end the story by implying that the adventure continued. With the resounding success of the feature film, Universal Pictures saw the joke as a great opportunity to make more money at the box office, thus giving the go-ahead for a continuation, which would generate two more sequels. The film was produced with a budget of forty million dollars and was shot together with its continuation; filming began in February 1989, after two years of building the sets and writing the scripts. Two actors from the first film, Crispin Glover and Claudia Wells did not return. Wells abandoned her career in Hollywood and Crispin was replaced by Jeffrey Weissman who received makeup to look like Glover, so that some scenes from the original film could be reused. Except that the actor had not allowed the reuse of his scenes, he sued Spielberg and won (since then, new laws have been created in the USA on image reuse).The script presents the same structure that we saw before - the interaction between generations different at the same age - but only in the future / present and in a much more frantic way. The script is very agile, but never exactly confusing, although it may depend a little too much on expository dialogues. All this, because this adventure in the future is only the first of three in the same film. With the various comings and goings in time, and the alternative reality of 1985, some say that the plot of Back to the Future 2 is too confusing. But Doc Brown is there to explain in a very didactic way - including a blackboard and drawings - what is happening in the plot. Nothing to mess with anyone's brain.In this second part, the comedy and innovative situations proposed by the first film are replaced by unbridled, breathtaking action. Point for the duo of screenwriters Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis: knowing that the freshness of the original story could not be matched, the two came up with an intricate adventure, full of twists and references to the series pilot. So, when we look back at the adventures of Marty McFly in 1955, a little of the emotion that we felt previously comes back to us. An interesting point of the script is the variation over several scenes from the original film: there is a sequence just like the one in which Marty runs away from Biff on a skateboard (here the skateboard is flying, and old Biff comments: 'This seems familiar '; another in which he thinks he dreamed of everything and his mother brings him back to reality; and so on. Other scenes have been fully recreated in order to include the characters in the second film (like the one where Marty plays Johnny B. Good while another Marty sways on the scaffold over his head).\nRevisiting the original film gives the audience a chance to take a different perspective on scenes we've previously seen. In addition to demonstrating the whimsy of the production, which manages to recreate scenarios and sequences in detail, we have a rare opportunity to see in another angle key moments of the original feature, such as Marty McFly's show at the Encanto Submarino ball, the clash between Biff and George in the parking lot and, of course, the best scene in the whole trilogy, the lightning bolt hitting the clock tower, the only one that is repeated in the three films. Although they took several precautions to make the visit to the original film perfect, the absence of Claudia Wells as Jennifer Parker (replaced by Elisabeth Shue) and Crispin Glover as George McFly (now replaced by Jeffrey Weissman, now appearing with archival images)) ended up undermining the success of the attempt. Anyway, nothing that spoils the fun, being a more noticeable detail for fans than for the general public.It is incredibly fun to imagine that a second Marty observed almost all the adventures of the first Marty and that the two Docs even talked in 1955. The idea of addressing the same events raises the potential for a temporal paradox to the tenth power, creating a real speculative source of blow the head. If the first third is fun, but flawed and the second is more flawed than fun, the third almost completely redeems the sins of Zemeckis and Gale. Merging recreations of iconic sequences with the reuse of passages from the original film, Zemeckis and Gale give a narrative show while Harry Keramidas and Arthur Schmidt simply innovate in the complicated task of assembling the work.As in the first film, the city of Hill Valley itself is an important character: it is the changes that occur in it that give the dark tone to the alternative gift created by Biff. It is worth, once again, the comparison with the small town of Happiness Is Not Buying, Bedford Falls (see the review for Back to the Future): the alternative Hill Valley would be the Bedford Falls that would exist if James Stewart's George Bailey did not had been born. Also worth mentioning is the Hill Valley of the future, a fantastic creation by the people of art direction and stage design (always together, of course, with Dean Cundey, the series' competent director of photography).There are, of course, some problems in the script, which are totally forgivable compared to the final set. For example, where did the change in Doc's behavior come from since the future is unknown? After all, he almost died, in the previous film, from not wanting to know what would happen to his future self. In Back to the Future 2, however, he takes Marty McFly to 2015 to shamelessly change the course of events. However, shortly afterwards he makes a speech about maintaining the continuum of the universe. Also, it seems that Gale and Zemeckis didn't quite know what to do with Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer: she spends most of the movie asleep. But, after all, who is she? Why did you marry Marty? (There is a hint that the wedding was not quite what she wanted, but only).According to Bob Gale and Bob Zemeckis, it was never the intention of the writers to take the story into the future - simply because it is extremely difficult to get it right. Therefore, the two decided to extrapolate when they had to follow the original joke and send the characters for 2015, thirty years in the future. For today's audiences, it's fun to watch what hit and miss the film's producers. Screenwriter Bob Gale, director Robert Zemeckis and the entire technical team, especially the art direction and costumes, had to imagine their own future and which, over time, proved capable of predicting future trends in fashion and behavior.\nNo flying cars, floating skateboards (hoverboards), pizzas that grow in seconds, self-adjusting and self-drying jackets, self-tie shoes. However, we can notice biometrics (several scenes in the film show people using digital to access some place or document), holograms (the one that scares Marty at the beginning of the film), drones (like the ones that take dogs for walks in Hill Valley - although not quite what we see today), video calls (another very common feature today but that was practically unthinkable in the 1980s, which we would have today technologies like Skype, Whatsapp and Facetime, for example), tablets ( at one point, Marty is introduced to a \"digital clipboard\"), giant televisions (several houses and businesses have televisions with large screens), games (in his traditional cafeteria, Marty plays with some kids in a video game that captures movement and uses peripherals , similar to the current Kinect and Wii). A few years ago, Nike announced the arrival of Marty McFly's Nike Air Mag (although it lit up and had the look of the film, the shoes did not have the main characteristic of their cinematographic counterpart: the automatic laces). All the exaggerations and situations imagined in 2015 make everything even more fun so many years later.The special effects are fantastic, as is the makeup. There is a scene, for example, in which Michael J. Fox plays three different characters who interact with each other (he plays the role of Marty at 47 and his two children: a boy and even a girl). The sequence is brilliant and innovative for the time. In fact, this type of 'encounter' happens several times during the film: the two Biffs (the one from 1955 and the 2015 one; the two Doc Browns (the one from 1955 and the 1985 one) and the two McFlys (both from 1985). It's a great exercise in visual effects, with the use of the VistaGlide camera developed by IL&M, but the end result, which still has a new George McFly upside down and full of prostheses to disguise the actor change ends up becoming a sequence strange, not very well developed and cluttered with information and that would only really end in the epilogue of Part III. Gale and Zemeckis took advantage of all the opportunities they had to create scenes in which visual effects were fundamental. car details in the scenes that take place in the future, that blend wonderfully in scale with the actual footage, being put together in virtually imperceptible transitions.In a very clever way, the script ends a cycle, attenuating the impression of \"middle film\" which is a very common feature in trilogies, for obvious reasons. This second part is a far above average experience, appropriating the original's concepts and ideas to literally expand its own universe. With visual effects even better than the original and with a roller coaster rhythm, it may not be as good as the original, but it has many qualities that make it very close. Its ending is an open one, with the end of the adventures of Marty and Doc Brown taking place in Back to the Future 3 (1990), an unsuspected comic western.",

            "content": "Depending on what you may or may not know of the series, you may know that Michael J. Fox was not the original Marty, and the majority of the first movie had been filmed before Robert Zemekis and Bob Gale decided to recast (ironically, MJF was their first choice, but due to scheduling conflicts was originally unable to do the movie). MJF makes this movie, not only is he enjoyable to watch, but he brings a comedic feel to an otherwise straight forward movie. I would also say that the on screen relationship in Christopher Lloyd and MJF is wonderful as well with near slapstick line delivery to the facial expressions throughout the movie.Next, let's talk about the plot; yes, it's overall about a kid who accidentally goes back in time, disrupts the future by negating the events of the past. He then has to fix this. Let's shorten that even, Marty leaves his current time and must get back. Shorten it even more, you say? Alright. Time Travel. So let's move passed the first movie (it's pretty straight forward: Marty goes back in time, disrupts his parents relationship which negated his birth and now must somehow fix this). Second Movie: Due to the events of the future, Marty's son will go to jail and begin a downward trend that ruins the mighty house of McFly. While on this adventure, Marty purchases a sports almanac that Biff eventually finds and sneakily takes back to 1955 which then offsets the future. Marty and Doc now need to go back to 1955 to steal back the almanac, but watch out, Doc, you might get struck by... crap. Movie 3: Doc in the Wild West. The plot truly makes this movie both iconic and disastrous all at once. If we think about the movie in terms of not being a movie, and characters doing the things that make sense instead of doing things for a movie, let's tear this movie to shreds: 1) To negate the whole movie, Doc could have simply told Marty and Jennifer about what would happen and to take precautions. This actually would have worked in III as well (\"Hey Doc, don't upset Mad Dog\"). 2) Given how the time line works (a linear path from A to B, with B changing as events resolve along the way, however B will always exist because it is the current path, but as we know, B can change), This means that while we see multiple characters (i.e. 1955 Doc interacts with 1985 Doc) the latter character should already have knowledge of this interaction (but perhaps was unaware of who they interacted with). This means that Doc should have a memory of speaking with a random person during 1955, but wasn't aware that it was himself until the 1985 Doc happened. Given this, Marty should remember this problem vividly and even without telling Griff 'no' should have made precautionary actions based on what he already knows will happen. This all of course is based on remembering one event for 30 years (time travel seems like something you'd always remember, but maybe I'm wrong). 3) Given that Doc has immediate knowledge of the future, why doesn't he make better choices? If having a friendship with Marty gets him in this issue, why doesn't the 1955 Doc make plans to not involve Marty? Seems like a selfish decision. 4) Lastly, and probably most importantly, given how the time line works, Biff would be unable to return to the 2015 that includes the 1985 Marty and Doc. Zemekis and Gale stated that their decision to write this plot made sense since 2015 Biff would be traveling from 1955 to 2015 before 1955 Biff makes his first bet, therefore, when he goes back to 2015, it would still be intact as it had been...but then it would...transform? I don't know, but this doesn't make any sense. As we saw in BTTF1, when Marty goes back to 1985, his family is now different, his house is now different, his life is now different. This is because of how our time line was established (A to B with B changing as events resolve), so even though Biff hadn't made his first bet, the act of receiving the Almanac is similar to George McFly knocking out Biff in 1955, which would lead to future events where he no longer is bullied, he's possibly the Class President, he's encouraged to share his writing and becomes a \"beloved writer\" (see BTTF2 in the obituary). Therefore when 2015 Biff hands 1955 Biff the almanac, the time line completely changes because we know what Biff does with his eventual wealth (creates Detroit, pt2). This would have left Marty and Doc in a situation where they neither have the means of time travel and would be in a 2015 alternate dimension. This is a huge plot hole that ultimately ruins the movie, but since time travel is all theory, I guess Zemekis and Gale can legitimately give their beliefs on this.So as a wrap up the review, I love this trilogy, and could watch all three movies regularly.",

I liked mostly this one among the other two movies because it is kind of a connection between back to the future 1 and 3.

            "content": "\"I don't want to hear anything about 'Back to the Future III.' Just give me g**d*** 'Back to the Future II'!\" These words were spoken by the head of Universal Studios when he learned that writer/director Robert Zemeckis and writer/producer Bob Gale had devised not one but TWO fantastic sequels for the original 1985 megahit \"Back to the Future.\" Of all three films in this famous trilogy, \"Back to the Future Part II\" is my favorite, simply because Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) endures more adventure and more stark terror in this movie than he does in the other two movies. Not to mention the sharp contrast of time periods through which Marty travels in \"Part II.\" (If you haven't yet seen any of the three films from the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy, please DO NOT read any further.) After the opening credits, Marty visits the future (2015), and then, after a brief sojourn into a nightmarish alternate reality (1985-A), he very quickly winds up back in the past once more (1955). The fact that the screenplay allows Marty to revisit 1955 with a different angle & viewpoint than he had in the first movie is what excited Robert Zemeckis more than anything else about the making of \"Back to the Future Part II.\" Zemeckis claims \"Part II\" to be his favorite in the trilogy and certainly one of the most interesting films he's ever made.Zemeckis once stated that great directing is great casting, and he is absolutely correct, because with the assembly of a fine cast, the director can be quite sure that he/she will elicit the strongest & most convincing performances from those actors he/she knows to be reliable. Most of the principal players from the original \"Back to the Future\" returned for the sequels, except for Crispin Glover. But the absence of Glover turned out to be a minor loss; Zemeckis believes that the sequels turned out fine anyway, and I agree. With actors like Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson, James Tolkan, etc., you just couldn't go wrong! My favorite highlights from \"Back to the Future Part II\" include the following. The year 2015, as depicted in this movie, involves a great number of astonishing devices & inventions (e.g., wild clothing fashions, flying automobiles, and hoverboards), often just for the sake of a joke! One of the funniest scenes in 2015 involves a shark hologram (from \"Jaws 19\") emerging in the air and scaring Marty out of his wits; when the hologram disappears, Marty comments, \"Shark still looks fake.\" In 1985-A, Marty climbs through a window into what he thinks is his house, but he soon finds out differently! Shortly afterwards, as a homage to director Frank Capra's 1946 classic \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" Marty runs through the town of Hill Valley and finds it to be a trashed, corrupt war zone filled with prostitutes, motorcycle gangs, and drive-by shootings; what really puts the cherry on the cake is Marty's horrified reaction to a TV monitor outside Biff Tannen's Pleasure Paradise that shows Biff (Wilson) being married to Marty's mother Lorraine (Thompson) in 1973. Marty narrowly escapes being shot in Biff's grand casino hotel when Biff learns that Marty knows about the troublesome sports almanac, which has been the cause of Biff's wealth & corrupt power. Back in 1955, Marty relives his big musical moment playing & singing \"Johnny B. Goode\" at the high school dance, but in order to prevent his other self from seeing him, he crawls on a catwalk way above the stage and drops a load of sandbags onto Biff's thugs (Casey Siemaszko, Billy Zane, and J.J. Cohen). Shortly after that, in the most amazing double image split I have ever seen, the real Marty is knocked unconscious by a door swung open by Marty's other self. And finally, in one of the most exciting stunts in the movie, Biff tries to shake Marty off his car while Marty holds on for dear life in trying to retrieve the sports almanac.\"Back to the Future Part II\" may have received quite a number of negative reviews and is probably not the classic that the original movie is becoming. I must admit that I had a difficult time trying to follow & understand everything that was going on in this sequel upon its initial theatrical release. When I watched it on videotape a few years later, I finally understood it and was quite enchanted with all the exciting adventures that Marty and Dr. Emmett L. \"Doc\" Brown (Lloyd) experience through their time travels. To me, \"Back to the Future Part II\" is simply a remarkable film!",

Only a couple of weeks ago I watched the first movie in the series again and I still liked it as much as I did when I first saw it. Now the second part was shown on television and I was curious about the fact whether I would like the sequel as much as the original version. Normally I don't like sequels all that much because they don't add anything to the story, but this movie is different...The second part of the \"Back to the Future\"-movies picks up where the first one ended as we see how Doc suddenly comes back from the future and asks Marty and Jennifer to come with him to 2015 to straighten out the future of the McFly family. After doing so, they return to their own time, discovering that something has drastically changed in their neighborhood. Violence, murder, gambling,... have become common practice in the once so quiet neighborhood. This happened because in 2015 Biff Tannen stole the Delorean, taking with him a book with the results of every sports event from the 1950's till 2000. He gave it to his younger version in the fifties, using it to become incredibly rich. In order to restore the present, Marty and Doc will have to return to 1955 so they can retrieve the book...Despite the fact that I feared that this would be an easy way of making even more money out of the success of the first movie, I must admit that this isn't really the case. Not only have they added the element of the future and the changed present, they have also added a new part to what happened in the first film. It's true that they have re-used several parts from that first movie, but it's never boring to watch, because they have always used another point of view, instead of just using the same footage. If they hadn't done that, I would probably not have liked it a bit, but now I did.Once again the acting in this movie was more than OK. The performances of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd weren't any different from those in the first movie and since I already liked them in that movie, I can only say that I liked them in this one as well. But the other actors like for instance Elisabeth Shue, who got a much bigger role in this movie, were also very good.All in all this is a very worthy sequel which makes me look forward to the last and final part. The still interesting story, the many new features, the good acting,... make this movie look a lot better than the average sequel. Perhaps interesting to know is that you should have seen the first movie in order to fully understand the second one. That's not always the case with sequels, but with this one it is. I liked that and I liked many other things as well and that's why I give it a 7.5/10.",

Whereas the first one tried to seem realistic in its fantasy, this one throws out all the logic and introspection with surprisingly excellent results. All the actors deliver great performances, especially Thomas F. Wilson, who portrays young Biff, middle-aged Biff, and old Biff so wonderfully that it's hard to believe it's the same actor. And the scene in which old Biff gives young Biff the sports almanac is one of the overlooked all-time classic scenes in cinema. One of the great things about this movie is that every little detail is devoted to hilarious mocking of economic and political situations. Pay careful attention to all of the newspaper headlines (\"Nixon Seeks Fifth Term\" in alternate 1985; and Biff's success at the race track in the 1950s gets more space than Kruschev becoming Soviet premiere).

            "content": "Most three part movies have dark middle sections. \"Back to the Future,\" \"Star Wars\" and \"Raiders of the Lost Arc\" have strong first movies because that's all there is of them. No sequels were considered until their success demanded more, so they made perfect little narratives with everything thrown in but the kitchen sink. The sink in all three cases was left for the second movies.\"Back to the Future\" featured two popular TV stars. Michael J. Fox from \"Family Ties\" and Christopher Lloyd from \"Taxi.\" It was a nice little story but not that great when Fox was hurtled from 1985 (I temember it well) to 1955 as he had little to do except hang around waiting for lightning to strike. You try that some time.A throwaway joke at the end of \"Back to the Future\" guaranteed a sequel had to be set in the twenty-first century.Part II's plot: Marty and Jennifer have to get to 2015 (an impossibly far-off date for us 1980s denizens) to get their kids out of trouble. While there, Marty buys a sports stat mag to win a chunk of change on sporting events when returning to his own time. Doc talks him out of it on specious grounds but old Biff Tannen gets his hands on the mag, steals the time-car and (shades of \"It's a Wonderful Life\") gives the mag to 1955 Biff who somehow turns Hill Valley into a hellhole by his winnings.Marty and Doc must figure out when young Biff got the mag and somehow wangle it away from him to restore the proper 1985 timeframe. We're beginning to need a physics degree to comprehend these flicks.The middle sections of many plays, etc. Are \"descents into Hell,\" Some more graphic than others. This one's pretty graphic.The whole second act is very unpleasant.The first act is merely nutty. Futurism is a dangerous discipline and while defenders of this movie's vision point to this or that thing that was right, it was really little like the 2015 I knew. That makes the first act of this movie look silly in retrospect (even sillier than when it first came out and we first-generation \"Back to the Future\" fans and semi-fans hoped we wouldn't spend 2015 with our pockets hanging inside out).Then there are the incredibly dangerous hoverboards. I wouldn't be surprised to learn accidents like the one depicted didn't happen daily.The third act, when Marty risks life and limb to get his hands on the sports mag, is largely a recap of the first movie's final act, seen with a skewed POV.The movie is, however, slightly redeemed when the mysterious Western Union man appears. The last few minutes are very good and lead directly to the vastly superior Part III.Unfortunately, Part III (which I am not reviewing here) became dependent on ideas and devices from Part II. That's the real shame of it. To understand Part III we have to survive Part II, which I've heartily disliked since it first came out.One other reason to watch Part II is to see Michael J. Fox trying to extend his acting chops. Some of it not pretty. His family don't look so much like they have a family resemblance, but that they were cloned. Why did George McFly look so different from Marty when so many members of Marty's family look just like him? Then there's Jennifer! In many ways she's the delight of Part II, small a role though it is.I always liked Michael J. Fox. He's a good actor, we're born just weeks apart, and he's shorter than my 5'8\". Fox's twinkly elfin charm, certainly more than Lloyd's overacting, helped me through this mess. Get through yourself however you can. But wake up before the superb ending that hurls us feet first into Part III, which I love.",

It appealed to me as it's a colorful movie about the past, present and future with great characters who all have distinct, memorable and funny personalities.As I watch this decades later I can see why I loved the movie. People say it's a rehash of part 1 and that definitely could be true. Part 3 seems to have a tone of its own but part 1 and 2 are similar. Part 2 focuses on the dark timeline as Biff (who's always up to no good) changes the present as he becomes a powerful force in Hill Valley or should I say Hell Valley. I liked it. A great performance by Thomas F. Wilson. From his movements and delivery of lines Biff is one of the most memorable villains in movie history.Also I liked how they envisioned the future in 1989. It still looks cool in 2019. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd also have great performances as the Doc and Marty who are still as cool as ever trying to save the day. Getting into a lot of exciting and funny situations. Great fun movie.",

            "content": "Ahh, yes. This film was probably my favorite installment of the 80's time-travel trilogy. Granted, I enjoyed more when I was younger but I still have a love for it now. I've always enjoyed this more than the other two films because of how much time-hopping we're treated to, with Zemeckis's vision of Hill Valley in 2015, an alternate 1985 in which Biff Tannen's a vile business mogul, and once again...1955. This film begins moments after the first film ended, with Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) returning from the future with a new and improved DeLorean to warn Marty (Michael J. Fox) and Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue, replacing Claudia Wells) about a future incident that ruins their son's life. Their trip brings about further problems when an elderly Biff (Thomas Wilson) discovers the time machine and uses it to make himself rich and powerful in the past.I'm always a bit confused when I read negative critic comments or poor reception for the film. As I understand, it confused audiences who weren't expecting a \"To Be Concluded\" ending to the film and may have turned audiences off to it, but even as a standalone film, PART II is great fun. I love the future sequences, with a picturesque Hill Valley populated by flying cars, hover-boards, and the campy Cafe 80's. The production design on this movie is what really gets me every time. In addition, the ILM computer effects have aged rather well considering the film was made in 1989. You can still spot the computer effects but they're never bad enough to pull you out of the film.Bob Gale returns to write the screenplay and, as such, the film has the same fun sense of humor as PART I and the characters remain true to form. Fox, Lloyd, Wilson, and Lea Thompson (as Marty's mom, Lorraine) all return to their respective roles and Elisabeth Shue steps in for Claudia Wells as Marty's girlfriend (though her part is limited in the film). All-in-all, this film is a classic staple of the 80's and it's fun enough that anyone and everyone could enjoy it. It's right up there with PART I as great 80's popcorn fun while PART III didn't carry on with the same feel. If by some chance you haven't seen Zemeckis's series (what's wrong with you?!), do yourself a favor and pick 'em up...especially PART II.",

But Biff Tannen steals the time machine and gives his younger self a book containing 50 years of sports statistics, which the young Biff uses to amass an enormous gambling fortune and transform idyllic Hill Valley into a living hell. To restore the present, Doc and Marty must return to the events of their previous adventure in 1955 and retrieve the book.It may be quite obvious that this film had a bigger budget than the first film. The visuals are much more extensive and great! And this is the best movie out of the trilogy! Why? Unlike the first and third films, the second is not only the most complicated, but probably one of the most complicated time travel movie I've ever seen! This movie surly makes you think! I loved it!It goes back and forth with bumps and bruises (which is a good thing). Also, I love the way how it was like \"Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban\". You see dopplegangers and characters trying to hide themselves.This film is much more exciting and you have tons of fun!All in all, as I said, it is the best in the trilogy.

            "review_title": "The Best Instalment in the BTTF Trilogy",
            "content": "The Back To The Future trilogy is undoubtedly one of the most successful movie franchise's in history, and there's no mistaking why. The sequel to the first movie was often criticised for being too complicated to understand- and yet it is due to the various sub-plots taking place within the movie, which makes this instalment the most interesting and eventful in the series. As others have rightly pointed out on here, Back To The Future: Part 2, will probably make no sense to you unless you have seen and understood the first film. The plot, is in itself, complicated: Marty McFly with Doc Brown travel forward in time to 2015 and to prevent further crises taking place with the future McFly family. As they do so, Biff, Marty's arch- enemy has got hold of a book that contains a list of sports statistics and results. With this, he uses it to make a fortune for himself, and hence he becomes a very rich man. Marty and the Doc have to retrieve the book, as well as to make sure they do not come into contact with alternate versions of themselves. Also, other events unfold as the film progresses: in 1985, George- Marty's father is deceased and thus, Marty discovers his mother, Lorraine is- wait for it- married to Biff! Marty and Doc Brown then travel back in time to 1955- where most of the first movie was based- to set the record straight.The film has so many great twists and in contrast to the first film, the narrative doesn't follow in the same way as your typical time-travelling flick. It also has some great action sequences thrown in, for instance, when Marty has to escape from Biff and his clowns using a kids hover-board.I was surprised to learn that Crispin Glover, who co-starred in the original BTTF film, was a notable absentee in this one. But I guess his absence did pay dividends for this sequel because it did make the story all the more compelling and intriguing to watch. The main leads in Fox, Lloyd, as well as the supporting cast in Thompson, Shue and Wilson all held the film in place really well and delivered their lines and performances with such style and professionalism. Lea Thompson's role as Lorraine Mcfly was wonderful-yet intriguing, given the fact that in real life she was born in the same year as Michael J Fox himself,- and so, I would, for the record, go on to say that she could've played the role of Marty's girlfriend in place of Elizabeth Shue.Personally, I preferred the second film over the others in the BTTF series, because I felt it was more challenging and that it kept viewers on the edge of their seats, which is all the more so as it didn't follow the conventional narrative formula as other sci-fi time travelling based films. Even though the story was complicated to get to grips with, BTTF 2 was unique and original in its own way, particularly as it had more to offer in terms of twists and turns. The first film was good, whilst with the third, I thought that the Wild West setting was somewhat of a mistake as it just didn't work as well as it should. But I could understand the fact that the writers, as well as Zemeckis, wanted to try something completely different.As in regards to Back The The Future 2, it is an enjoyable and exciting ride and one of the rarest and best examples of a film sequel ever produced. With great special FX, excellent dialogue, great performances, good humour and an interesting narrative and plot, all these make for a terrific classic, which this film is. Full marks!",

            "content": "The working title of the film was \"Paradox\" and both this sequel and Part I of this film confirm this. The film was changed because George Mcfly's actor from Part I did not sign on for Part II. He held out for more money so they wrote the story around him. George appears upside-down in an anti-gravity suit in and looks like \"Pappy Yokum\" from Li'l Abner. Anyone could be in that makeup! So the story becomes simply about a sports book that lists all the winning scores from several previous decades. Biff is given this book by his \"future\" self who steals the time machine to go back to 1955. This completely screws up the time-space continuum and George McFly ends up dead! I like the futuristic 1st half of the movie, but the scenes set in revised 1955 and 1985 seem a bit more cruel and mean-spirited, and not in tone with the rest of the series. The 1955 redux is very confusing, though very well-done and not as much much fun as the original Part I. The producers suggest watching Parts I and II back-to-back to understand the differences better. The optical process shots with multiple personalities (like \"The Parent Trap\") are amazing and flawless. Michael (in drag) as his own daughter! The futuristic (2015) is a lot of fun. Biff as a casino boss and Marty's \"pumped up\" big-breasted Mom are both hilarious and disastrous to see. It all serves as a set-up for Part III, which is is actually the best movie of the Trilogy.",

The intrigue of time travel into the future is one of the biggest allures for science fiction, and Part 2 makes it look very clean and fun. Granted, there are some major plot holes that result from the \"cause and effect\" paradox of time travel, but for the sake of entertainment, we have to push that away. Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fun the second time around, with the continuum of time at stake this time. After journeying into the future, they discover they have to go back and fix the past again - the 1955 that they'd already visited. The movie is fun, fancy, and it keeps you hooked to the end. I don't know what problem the critics had with this one; I liked it, because it took the spirit of the first one, and transformed it into a dynamic story, enjoyable action scenes, and respectable dialogue.

            "content": "October 21, 2015 \u2013 the faithful date at which point the present became the future, and, as of now, the past. Head hurting yet? That's okay, as there has never been so seamless a blending of nostalgia and time travel as in Robert Zemeckis' breezily legendary adventure saga. Interestingly, Parts I and II often get lumped together in the public unconsciousness \u2013 fair enough, as Part II operates in part as a 'Greatest Hits' recap of the first. Still, it's fairly important to distinguish, as, temporal overlap aside, Part II is very much its own animal \u2013 and not always in a pleasant way. The film is essentially a three act, and, correspondingly, three-time affair. Act 1, 'The Future' (aka: the part that everyone remembers), is thoroughly in the vein of the original \u2013 a vivaciously animated affair, chock full with fun, sci-fi escapism. Of course, as we now inhabit the realm of 'the future', this comes with the added pleasure of compiling lists of 'things they got right' and 'things they overestimated' (I'm still waiting for my hoverboard, let alone flying car \u2013 where the '80s-futurism fashion aesthetic sits is still up for grabs). Here, Zemeckis' imagination goes into wacky overdrive, with clever gags aplenty (the 3D Jaws 19 \u2013 \"This time it's really, REALLY personal\" is priceless, while the 'antique store' is funny for an entirely different reason now that cassette tapes qualify as such) and a hoverboard chase that could have been ripped from Part I, while allowing Michael J. Fox and Lea Thompson to totter around in aging prosthetics as their 'future selves' is worth a giggle or two. Yes, there's a blip of eyebrow-raising discomfort at opening the film with Doc drugging protagonist Marty McFly's girlfriend Jennifer (this time, Elizabeth Shue \u2013 did anyone notice the switcharoo?) and abandoning her, unattended, by a dumpster (umm\u0085), but the flux capacitor is otherwise cranked firmly to 'zany' here. And hey \u2013 anything with cameos from Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers and baby Elijah Wood in his first acting role can only be awesome. It's really quite a shame we don't get more time here (ha\u0085), as it's in this beginning segment that the film really soars. But then: as the film leaps back to its (alternate) past, there's not such much of a tonal shift as a paradigm shift. Suddenly, we're in the midst of a disconcerting It's a Wonderful Life tribute on steroids - a dark, hellish wasteland of derelict housing, surly bikers, and imposing, sinister casinos, masterminded by Biff's deranged Donald Trump doppelg\u00e4nger (who, yes, even in the 80s, was based on Donald Trump- the film's most chilling prophecy). Candy-coloured, whizz-bang adventure aside, the Back to the Future saga was never wholeheartedly saccharine - there's always been resonantly somber stuff about aging, bullying, and going through life perennially unsatisfied to chew on. Still, in this dark pit of coercive, abusive marriages, corruption, and murder, all played oddly nonchalantly, it's no wonder that the recurring \"What are you \u2013 chicken?\" gag loses its gas when juxtaposed with a sequence of McFly sobbing in a cemetery. Yeah - didn't remember all that, did you? I didn't think so. The sad truth is that the film as a whole can't justify such a distressingly macabre tangent. Most other It's a Wonderful Life spin-offs are careful to provide plenty of joy to counteract and contextualize their dark diversions. Here, we're stranded with preciously few of the iconic cheerful bits of Part I (no Huey Lewis and the News here\u0085), leaving little to latch onto. Even the final third, retreading the 50s-set jauntiness of its predecessor, is really more strained and convoluted, shoehorning in too many artificial conflicts, to be as fun or clever as it should be. By the time Zemeckis wraps it up with a 'to be continued' teaser for Part III, it's pretty hard to keep the frustration and feeling of being cheated at bay. Still, it's hard to beat the unquenchable sky-high charisma of the unforgettable double-act of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. While both are largely restricted to forwarding plot pieces than given memorable lines or character beats here, there's still no disputing that Marty McFly and Doc Brown remain among the most beloved and resilient of characters to ever grace the screen (even if the comparative scarcity of Doc here becomes steadily more of a disappointment). What is it a bit more objectionable is the surplus of Thomas F. Wilson's legendary butthead Biff. The larger-than-life, unapologetically awful Biff has always worked best as a foil for the more loopy and cheerful protagonists, but promoting Wilson to principle player here makes his obnoxious negativity more exhausting than enjoyable (although Wilson exploring new dimensions of surreal over-the-top performance as Biff's cybernetically warped descendant Griff in the 2015 segment is always good for a laugh, albeit a vaguely disconcerted one). Thankfully, Back to the Future Part II still upholds enough of the charming whimsy of the first to still provide a raucously entertaining ride, combined with even more brain-teasing time travel trickery to mull over for years to come. It is a shame that, 2015 sequence aside, the film feels more manufactured and becomes so unreasonably dark that it loses a lot of the joy and spontaneity of its predecessor. However, for magnanimous audiences already infatuated with the peerlessly magnetic McFly and Doc Brown, this hop into the DeLorean is likely to provide just as much of a slice of movie magic as you could wish for. -6.5/10",

            "content": "The first \"Back to the Future\" was a whimsical fantasy adventure that managed to blend silliness, cleverness, action, and science-fiction into a delightful \"what-if\" scenario.  \"Part 2\" picks up at the moment the original left off, with Marty and the Doc heading into the future to prevent a family disaster.  Once again, the movie attempts to blend silliness, cleverness, action, and science-fiction, but this time the total is less than the sum of the parts.In the future, Marty tries to keep his son from getting arrested for robbery, which he does, but in the process his now aged nemesis Biff steals the DeLorean and changes the his future, which, of course, changes Marty's as well.  Marty and the Doc are unaware of Biff's actions until they return to the past--er, present--and discover a world they no longer know.  Their only choice is to go back in time and prevent Biff from changing history.When stated in the form of a paragraph, the plot seems basic and flowing, but the movie is anything but.  The film has all the necessary ingredients to create a worthy sequel to the original, but none of the pieces fit together.  All the scenes feel like one-act plays, none really relating to the other until the third act, which does manage to tie a couple of threads together, but even then, many of the early parts fell like so much filler.Gone is the wry humor of the original (\"You are my density\"), and the cleverness of the plot, the fun of exploring the possibilities of a time paradox.  What we get in return is a chance to watch the original movie from a different angle (literally)--a treat, to be sure--but that doesn't come until the third act.  At that point we're reminded of the fun of the original \"Future\", something this sequel can't manage to recreate.In some ways, the sketchiness of the film makes sense.  The fact that \"Part 2\" doesn't end (the plot is resolved, but not everyone is where they should be) and the hints to \"Part 3\" littered throughout this installment indicate that the two films were meant to be a single story.  Together, I guess they do form a complete whole, but when compared to another \"bridge\" sequel, \"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\", even that excuse fails to satisfy.  I think what we really have is filmmakers with a deadline that forced them to cut short the rewriting phase.  Pity.7/10**1/2C",

The other problem, but not a serious plot hole is him giving the Almanac to his younger self in 1955, which a future has changed, the old Biff should disappeared or something.

            "content": "After the gigantic success of Back to the Future in 1985, Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale reunite for the sequel Back to the Future Part II. It received mixed reviews upon release, but it has gained a cult following in the years since release. Personally, I always enjoyed the movie. Yes, it does have an extremely complicated plot with many different time frames and paradoxes and whatnot. But if you want to avoid a headache and be take in for a wild ride, it may be best to shut off your brain for two hours. The movie had enough jokes to take the film into screwball territory at times. I still find the interactions between Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd to be gold. What surprised me and the audience in 1989 was how dark the film became when our heroes ventured back in the '85 world. I thought they entered the world of Blade Runner but no, that is just part of the plot. I liked their depiction of 2015. Gale and Zemeckis weren't trying to predict the future, but they got some things right. They admitted that they knew there would be no flying cars by 2015, but you gotta have them, right? I dug the positive vibes that were seen in the film's version of 2015. Have y'all seen Jaws 19 yet?The original picture never meant to get a sequel. It had so much success at the box office that there was no choice in the mind of the studio. Zemeckis would not return unless Fox and Lloyd were back. Funnily enough, Fox was not aware of the sequel until he saw the end credits which said the team would be back. Gale and Zemeckis came up with idea of time paradoxes which would allow them to go back to 1955 and see those events from a different light. There were some stumbling blocks. Crispin Glover did not return over money issues, so they decided to use Glover's likeness. He was angry and sued the producers. Now there are clauses in the SAG collective bargaining agreement that bans movies from using likenesses of actors without permission. That is a shame Glover could not return because he was part of the first film's magic. In addition, Claudia Wells who originally played Jennifer was replaced by Elizabeth Shue. They had to reshoot the first film's ending with the different actress. These are slight blemishes the team faced trying to get the film produced. In order to be more cost effective, they shot this and the third film back-to-back. It was not a wild success at the box office, but it was still made some decent financial returns.The film truly excels with the production design and visual effects. Rick Carter wanted to give the film a darker look, something deeper than the typical Blade Runner look. I loved how they created 2015 and the alternate 1985 world. For this particular film, ILM entered digital compositing and using the motion control camera system for the first time. This allowed camera movement in one of the more complex scenes where Fox portrayed three characters at once (in a really humorous sequence). In the 2015 world, we can play that game \"was it invented or was it not?\" I think they have a good track record in what inventions the film displayed when compared to reality.The sequel picks up right where the original film ended with Marty (Michael J. Fox), Doc (Christopher Lloyd), and Jennifer (Elizabeth Shue) going to 1985 to help Marty's and Jennifer's children. When they completed what they needed to do, they return to their time...but it is not quite how they left it. Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) owns a bigshot casino and is married to Marty's mom, Lorraine (Lea Thompson). Marty finds out that his dad died years before. Doc concludes that Biff used a sports almanac from the future to bet on sports scores to amass his fortune. Apparently, future Biff stole the DeLorean and went to his younger self with the almanac. Marty and Doc have to go back to 1955 to the school dance to retrieve the book. Marty cannot be seen by Doc's younger self. But if Marty is called a coward, even more trouble may arise.The film is paced by Fox's and Lloyd's frenetic energy. There is more screwball comedy, but they keep the same energy possessed in the first film. I love when Chris Lloyd goes over-the-top as Doc. If you find yourself lost by any plot points, the performances should at least keep you grounded. I was very interested in Wilson's portrayal as the many Biffs seen throughout. One thing for sure, he knows how to keep Biff an unlikable character.I'm glad Back to the Future Part II is getting more love today. It is not a great nor original as the first film. Does it have it to be? It was nice just being back in the same world as these beloved characters. The plot can be borderline incomprehensible at times, but the characters make up for that especially with an added screwball element. The visual effects and production design take advantage of the latest technology to create memorable images. Robert Zemeckis created a magical franchise. And do I need to say anything about Alan Silvestri's fantastic score?My Grade: B+",

Plot: Continuing form the first film, Marty, Doc, and Jennifer are flying to the year 2015. It turns out that in the near future, Marty's kid will go to prison. So he goes to where he is being bullied by Biff's grandson Griff. Instead, Griff and his group of friends are taken to prison. While in the future, Marty buys a sports book that says the game winnings from the past. Marty's idea is to go to the past, go to each of these games, bet, and win. But when he throws the book away, things may not look good for Marty's future. That's quite a lot said in there. I loved Back to the future Part II almost as much as the original. This film is very funny like the first film and the original cast returns. Back to the Future Part II isn't a disappointment.

            "content": "Part II takes the surface characteristics of the original but somehow forgets to transfer the original's essence. There is something perfect in the original that just feels forced in the second one. The second one also begins the characteristic of global-scale reproduction of sequences from the original. reproducing entire sequences from the original, set in different eras and reworked. This is done for comedic purposes. We're supposed to recognise the sequences and say \"ha ha, that's right.\" It is most certainly done intentionally.Like many sequals it tries to be bigger than the original and ends up being worse. A movie which tells us one brilliant small story vibrantly, so we never forget it, will usually be better than one which tries to tell us many large events and stories. It gives us more time jumping, which ends up making it uneven (which is why it stays in your mind less, I think). Its very episodic, with only the thread of getting the sports alamac off Biff and Marty and Doc to hold it together.It involves larger-scale changes to the future: Biff's becoming rich means the entire world is thrown into disarray for a portion of the film, entire areas are slums, brothels and biker-gang hovels. This kind of superlative treatment of plot will only really work for kiddies, who'll find it too unpleasant anyway.Plus, it also makes a whole lot less sense. Because it deals with so many time-jumps, there are so many more places to slip up and disregard the rules established within the world of the film for time travel: that interacting with anything in the past will change it, for instance.What is clever about the second one, and was always the thing I liked most about it when I was a boy, was how Marty and Doc go back to when the first film was taking place, and we run into those events again, we see Marty, George and Lorraine doing their bits from the first movie. Its fairly obviously trying to get people to say \"oh isn't that clever,\" but its still pretty fun all the same.",

            "content": "\"Back to the Future: Part II\" is an exhilarating sequel to a modern-day classic. Throwing out all sense of believability and probability in favor of making it zanier and more random than its marvelously-plotted predecessor, remarkably, it comes across as almost as equally entertaining. Picking up where the first film left off, Marty (Michael J. Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) travel forward in time in order to correct tragic future events, all the while becoming more and more aware of the dangers of time travel. Their fears turn to reality when, in the future, an elderly Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) steals the Flux Capacitor-equipped DeLorean and adjusts his own past to make an alternative reality in which he rules in a dystopian dictatorship. When discovering what happens, it is up to Marty to once again travel to 1955, avoid ruining what he fixed the first time, and correcting things for the future. It sounds complicated, but that's only because it is.\"Part II\" and the third sequel in this Robert Zemeckis trilogy are liable to disappoint a fair percentage of people, especially if they are admirers of the original. The first \"Back to the Future\" is one of Robert Zemeckis's masterpieces, using a plethora of imaginative plot elements that are now conventions, and using first-class storytelling to make a very sweet, and (rare for a science-fiction film) touching opus. \"Part II\" assumes the same visual style and imagination, but instead throws the sweeter elements out the window in favor of more gadgets, more monologues from Doc, more complications in the plot, and more kinetic energy. Despite all of this, however, it comes off as very exhilarating. \"Part II\" is really an old-fashioned sort of time-travel movie, but is done with such zest and excitement as only a director of Zemeckis's level can give us that it puts you on the edge of your seat.I will admit, the first half-hour of the movie, the look into the far future, didn't quite ring my bell and I was a bit apprehensive. But once the plot of Biff stealing the time machine and altering the course of events comes into place, the film really picks up the tempo and keeps on going all the way until its daredevil culmination. It does not measure up to the original film, but it is very exciting and certainly more fun than the disappointing \"Back to the Future: Part III.\"",

Interesting story about time travel, with lots of funny stuff inside to make them great comedy in addition as scientific fiction.  Every time when you re-watch it you will find some more about the plot used to contrast/correspond different times at 1955/1985/2015.As a film made 5 years after BTTF 1, I wonder how it can relate so closely with it, even at the little parts.However, I just think of one goof with the movies: in 2015 old Biff took the time machine and travelled back to 1955 and gave the Sport Almanc to young Biff at that time.  Then the timeline should split to the alternate version (which cause Marty and Doc came back to the dark Hill Valley in 1985). Then why Biff can come back to 2015, where the timeline version was the same as the one he left.  According to the theory of Doc, Biff should also be a rich man in 2015.Maybe this is the only way Marty and Doc could get back the time machine and have the story continued.Anyway, I like the spirit that brought by the BTTF series: future is in your hands and you are able to change it!",

            "content": "It seems pretty clear that there never was a sequel planned for Back to the Future, but as many hit films do, the money rolled in and the executives demanded more. Zemeckis was then left with the awkward situation of having to live up to the fantastic teased ending of the original, which hampers the plot of this one significantly. The most telling sign of this is the fact that they had to somehow write Jennifer into the plot again (and recast and reshoot too) - so we have a sort of introduction to the McFly family of the future, with gags and tricks and all, and then what could've been a promising storyline dissolves into yet another Biff v Marty battle again. early on, Jennifer is literally put to sleep and dumped onto the street because she is merely an accessory for the plot. Nevertheless, the future does bring some awe-inspiring new visuals that shows that Zemeckis is clearly in his element regarding this area. Four years on and with more financial freedom meant a lot more than just the quick hovercar hint we had previously been wowed with. Again he uses that dramatic crane reveal, and inserts the same little clues that we saw back in 1955 in Hill Valley; a bionic Mayor Goldie, sleek cars on road and flying high in the skies, lifelike holographic sharks, the same caf\u00e9 now as a vintage novelty etc. Everything is composited so smoothly and seamlessly - there's a rather excellent bit of visual effects in the background of the caf\u00e9 window, as Biff and his gang land their car down from the air and stroll in. Another director might have just shot them walking in through the door, but this little bit of magic makes it all the more immersive - aside bizarre futuristic fashion designs and video games that need hands to operate (Just one of the correct predictions of our times).It is a pity that the ingenuity of the visual effects does not match the characters that it serves. In BTTF, Biff was a minor character, a bully but not a prominent case study in himself. Here, we have 4 Biffs in the caf\u00e9, dressed ludicrously, and all spitting the same insults and wanting to exact the same physical punishments. Later on, the entire timeline is altered because of a rogue elderly Biff and suddenly his character is much more present. Sure, the image of the towering and immense Pleasure Paradise is stunning, but the overall changes to this alternate timelines become almost mean spirited, something that the original film did not represent. If the future bully Biffy was spastic and thuggish, this one is cartoonishly evil - at one point he even descends to broadcasting his entire origins of success to our hero before attempting to finish him. And to open it all, we have not a bizarrely humorous situation where Marty is mistaken for an alien and his ufo, but an angry man with a bat who destroys everything in an over-the-top manner. And why is Mr Strickland the target of drive by shootings? It is a mystery; he is simply another errant cameo. The Marty of the past was a hero, short in stature and quick to know when he was outmatched. This time, Fox is the same, but there are some weird moments of characterisation that seem to go against everything established in the sequel. Twice, Biff calls him a chicken, and twice, Marty freezes in his stance and dramatically turns around and gives this glare to a rather inane schoolboy insult. And the older Marty is in on it too. Since when is Marty highly strung and reactive to those who question his bravery, nevertheless being questioned by the worst of bullies? And why is Fox the one playing his future daughter? The makeup in this series has always been of a high quality, but it seems this is just showing off rather than creating a substantial character. There are snippets of a meaningful storyline in the conversations about how Marty lost his ability and passion to play music and descended into the corporate world, but it seems Biff has a high priority. This is a rather disappointing sequel. For the all the great gags like the power laces (Alright!), the hydrating pizza (Who's going to eat all that?), the split-screen TV and the ever desired hoverboard that continues to elude us well after October 21 2015, there's not much to really enjoy.",

It took four years, but finally, in 1989, \"Back to the Future Part II\" was released. As with many movie sequels, this one has not been as well received as its predecessor, and many have considered it a disappointment, but much more disappointing sequels have seen the light of day.Doc takes Marty and Jennifer in his time machine to the year 2015 so they can fix up some problems with the future of the McFly family. While in that year, Marty purchases an almanac telling the results of sports events from 1950 to 2000. After they are finished their work in 2015, they return to 1985, but soon, it is clear that it's a lot different from the way it was when they left! It turns out that while they were in 2015, an elderly Biff Tannen borrowed their time machine and travelled back to 1955, where he gave the almanac to his teenage self! By 1985, after easily winning so many bets in the past thirty years, Biff has become very rich and powerful, and has turned Hill Valley into a nightmare! It is now up to Marty and Doc to travel back to 1955 and somehow retrieve the sports almanac! The IMDb rating for \"Back to the Future Part II\" is 7.2/10, which is significantly lower than the 8.2/10 rating for the original \"Back to the Future\", but is still a fairly high rating, which means that many have still enjoyed this second installment in the trilogy, including me. I have to agree that this sequel is inferior to the original. It's a bit darker, with more unpleasant things happening, which may not always be a bad thing, but here, it might be overdone just a bit. There are also probably not quite as many laughs in this sequel as there are in its predecessor. However, just like the original \"Back to the Future\", this second installment in the trilogy is mostly very exciting, which is enough to save it.If you don't like the original \"Back to the Future\", then I think it's obvious that there's no point in watching this 1989 sequel. However, if you're a big fan of the original, but haven't seen \"Part II\", I'm sure you really want to know where the story goes from there. So, while I wouldn't expect to be as pleased with this movie as you were with its extremely popular predecessor (unless you're really lucky), I see no reason why you shouldn't watch this second installment in the trilogy.",

            "content": "My Take: Wildly elaborate and highly imaginative.This sequel falls where everyone feared the original BACK TO THE FUTURE might fall upon. This sequel is more effects-driven than the first film, and there are more special effects here than the first film. This sequel is not as good as the first film (and that film was very good), with its lack of ingenuity and more focused on the quality of the special effects, but that doesn't mean the special effects delight upon itself. The film is still a lot of fun, and director Robert Zemekis and producer Steven Spielberg's liveliness are at an evident abundance. It is still what a sequel should be.Instead of going to the usual knock-off as any expensive sequel does, the new script by Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis took some time (no pun intended) to right a new script with still numerous insightfully ingenious ideas, but often too many. The film jumps from the future, where McFly must right a few wrongs that occur with his future family, and then jumps from present to past and the explanation seems confusing that it injures the plot with heavy confusion. Although I wasn't immensely confused by it, but I know I'm not the same as all the audience who've seen it.But, still, there is so much more to enjoy in the film's visual appeal, with special effects that are elaborate and fancy, even if some of which are dated to our standards. Consulting George Lucas' ILM effects house, Zemckis and crew have made this into a very busy enterprise, but one with heart. There's a lot of imagination that went to the special effects, which seemed enough for me to be appealed. What today's special effects throughly lacked are the minds behind them. This time, the effects are well imagined, owing more to those who think them up rather than those who make them fancy.Overall, not your typical sequel. That is, because the very typical sequels are those that try their best while with so little to know about what made their predecessors so good. This one lacks what made the first film so good, but at least it makes an effort to be imaginative. I like it and I heavily recommend it.Rating: **** out of 5.",

With enough comedy and enough planning to rule all of time, Bob Gale and Rob Zemeckis brought another provocative film to the table in the sequel to Back to the Future with Marty and the Doc having another fast flowing tense adventure through time.You can almost forget your comparisons with Dr Who's and Donnie Darko's as this picture proves once more that the DeLorean adventures really do give a knockout effect of unconditional action entertainment for the entire family.Repeating the end scenes from the previous release Part II follows the Doc and Marty to 2015 where Marty's kid is on the brink of ruining his life, and only Marty's intervention can save his family.As with the original this sequel deals in the complexities of intervention and careful treading through key situations. In an almost freakish manor Marty Junior is presented as the spitting image of his father and after a few tasteful jokes and a hard beating, Marty attempts to save his son from ruining his life. What follows is the best sequence from the trilogy in my personal opinion as Marty grabs a hover-board and like the first picture attempts a getaway from Griff's gang as they chase him through the streets. This sequence is a wonderful action orientated thriller with wonderfully staged set ups including a mistimed use of the small water section and the usual inclusion of manure.From here things start to heat up as Biff travels back in time and supplies his earlier self with a book that makes him rich and powerful, ultimately changing the complexion of 1985 when the Doc and Marty return.The knowledge of science and unfound knowledge of time travel is as ever present as the Doc once more confides his knowledge about alternate universes and the implications of changed events and how this now affects them. Once more the pair has to journey back to the exact same day in 1955 without running into themselves from their previous adventure. All this technicality and judgement marks some juicy 'almost' moments and somehow gives the events of the previous film more spring and fluidity.Once more Michael J Fox delivers the cool of all cool to cement his character well and truly in the history books. His hover-board abilities make him even more likable and this confrontation marksmanship of \"Are you chicken?\" allows him to delve into obsequious mode and with Christopher Lloyd similarly exuberant as the previous instalment, we have another fantastic family film that excels in entertainment and whilst it isn't as free and experimental as the first, is still a timeless masterpiece.",

All the lead actors give mind blowing performances and never once deprive the viewer of the character.What is really special here is the film makers perception of the future. It is so well pulled off that the 1980's are left light years behind.  The attention to detail is paramount leaving no stone unturned.After Marty's and Doc's trip to the future, you think it can't possibly get any better, yet unbelievebly the film goes and entangles itself with the first of the trilogy, resulting in some of the best moving making I have ever seen.  Who ever came up with this crazy, yet indulging masterpiece of films should be forever thanked.Although a little disjointed in places and strange in others, this film does not fail to deliver.  In sci-fi films I look for the atmosphere that the film maker is attempting to create in order to help me believe in the wierd or wonderful things that may be happening.  Believe me, this film has got bags of the stuff and then some.For anyone who hasn't seen any of the BTTF films, I strongly recommend you watch them in order.  I'm sure any sci-fi adventure fan will be hooked!Anyone with a DVD player lookout cos, the BTTF Trilogy is coming in the summer 2002.

Still it seems exciting full of wonder and none of the regular problems we faced in the real 2015 which I gladly change my life for in a heartbeat.Biff returns as a mastermind villain who overheads a plan to use an almanac from the future and place a few spitting bets to make some dole.What follows is another invention of alternate worlds, parallel universes and time travelers keeping past memories of time shifts while everyone around them changes in waves.Doc and Marty use their original memories to travel back in time to stop Hellvalley from occurring by stopping old men from handing off the book to his younger self.The rest feels like deju with a few alternate takes on the ending to the first and doesn't bear repeating.The only faults I found with This sequel is it never answers why the universe didn't impose by all the changes, did Marty take over his Au pair self and how did Doc create the time machine from inside a sanitarium?Still I found it very entertaining and charming as the first.",

            "content": "On the surface, the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy is a light hearted comedy that occasionally shows the potential danger of time travel. Look deeper though and you'll find that it's also a metaphor about what it means to be a man. In the first film, being a man was defined as having the guts to stand up for yourself. In the sequels, this notion is turned on its ear, suggesting that being a man also means you have to know when to reign yourself in. But more on that later.Picking up where the first film left off, Doc whisks Marty and his girlfriend/future wife Jennifer (exit Claudia Wells, enter Elisabeth Shue, who, like Michael J. Fox, clearly looks too old to be playing a teenager) to the year 2015 so they can sort out some family problems. Well, primarily Marty has to sort out the problems, Doc puts Jennifer out because she's not important to the plan (in actuality, the writers were too lazy to make her part bigger so they just put her under). The immediate problem Doc needs Marty to contend with is that his future son Marty Jr. is going to be arrested for taking part in a robbery that is being concocted by Griff Tannen, grandson of Biff Tannen (both played by Thomas F. Wilson; Griff's parents are never shown). Since Jr. is the spitting image of Marty, Marty is able to take his place but before he does so, he witnesses what a wimp his son is and, while posing as his son, the extremely old man version of Biff mistakes Marty for Jr. (\"Say hi to your grandma for me kid.\") and taunts him about a mistake he has yet to make. Marty's temper gets him into trouble with Griff and leads to a chase on hover-boards that's essentially a slicked up version of the skateboard chase from #1. Marty gets Griff in trouble and as a result his son is saved from being arrested, but then Jennifer is picked up by some cops and, thinking she's had one hell of a face lift, they take her to her future home, where she wakes up and spies on her future family. She overhears future in laws Lorraine (Leah Thompson) and George (exit Crispin Glover, enter Jeff Weissman) talking about a car accident that Marty got into where he permanently injured his guitar hand and was unable to pursue his music ambitions, which led to a wasted life in a power plant and unhappy life with his family. Middle aged Marty is in even worse shape than his father originally was, and then, having not learned his lesson from the car accident, he gets himself fired for letting a co-worker, the same guy who got him in that accident, goad him into illegal activity! Jennifer then faints when she confronts her middle aged self and is taken back to 1985 by Doc and Marty.Except 1985 has changed once again! Biff Tannen, now a successful millionaire, has taken over the town, murdered George and married Lorraine while the alternate Marty is in a boarding school somewhere and the alternate Doc is in a mental institution! Fortunately, the \"real\" Doc is on hand with the \"real\" Marty and they remember that Marty left a sports almanac in the time machine because he wanted to place a few bets, but Biff caught wind of this, stole the time machine and gave the almanac to his younger self in 1955 so that he could make himself rich: that is why Hill Valley is now a living hell and Marty's mom Lorraine is trapped in an abusive/loveless marriage where she is forced to look like a middle aged whore. After realizing that this is basically all his fault, Marty and Doc go back in time and follow the two Biffs around to get the almanac back from him, but Marty's temper nearly thwarts them when Biff calls him \"chicken\". Well, they manage to get the almanac and burn it, thus restoring the original alternate time line from the first film, but the time machine is struck by lightning and sends Doc back to 1885!The whole reversed manhood message comes to full circle in part 3.\nIronically, the plot here came to be due to the studio's inability to work out a deal with Crispin Glover for the George McFly part. Elisabeth Shue is wasted as Jennifer, but she has a few funny if typical \"girl humor\" moments (like her excitement at being able to see her future wedding and her shock at seeing her older self). Why Fox plays his own daughter is unknown (maybe he felt he felt he owed to his co-stars). Still, the film is pretty funny in a slightly darker way (though the future of 2015 is refreshingly brighter than most futures). My favorite line is \"I feel like we're in hell or something./No, it's most definitely Hill Valley, but I can't imagine how HELL could be much worse!\"",

Things might have gone well if that was all that he did however he has an idea to make a bit of money on his return by taking a book of future sports results back with him. Doc tells him to destroy the book but he leaves it it the DeLorean. Having overheard this conversation Biff steals the car while they are picking up Jennifer and returns it before they notice it had gone.When they return home to 1985 everything has changed, the town of more like a war zone, somebody else is living in Marty's house and Biff is a millionaire living in a casino with Marty's mother. Marty confronts him and finds out that Biff had been given the future sports book by somebody claiming to be a relative back in 1955, using the results inside he had amassed a fortune. The only way to set things right is to go back to 1955 once more and retrieve the book before Biff can use it.I enjoyed the darker tone of this film although some of the special effects in the future scenes looked a bit ropey by today's standards.",

            "content": "While it does fairly well for itself on the IMDb, I've found BTTF II to be regarded as the weakest link in some quarters.I'd put this down to its complex narrative, which confuses some and leaves others cold. A shame, as it's my favourite of the series, brimming with constant invention. Many of the delights of the film come from futuristic devices you just wish were real: hover skateboards, self-lacing boots and auto-drying clothes. The movie somehow, inexplicably, has the power to draw you into its experiences. You might not be able to ride a hoverboard, but this is the next best thing.Some brilliant in-jokes are pitched in Executive Producer Steven Spielberg's direction: a holographic Jaws 19 is dismissed by Marty as \"still looks fake\", while pal Michael Jackson gets a Max Headroom makeover. This is the sort of film where it's almost impossible to get bored, there's simply always something to see, and the pace never lets up. Michael J. Fox is as likeable as always in the lead role, while Thomas F. Wilson clearly enjoys going over the top in his dual parts.Apart from some product placement this really is a harmless, superb entertainment, and while some of the sports references - the Cubs winning the world series - mean little outside America, the principle of using time to cheat at gambling is a universally understood one. If there's a genuine complaint then it's that the series misses the presence of Crispin Glover, and that Lea Thompson gives a weak performance, though this is more than made up for by the multiple roles Fox gets to play. His five parts include his future self, plus his own son and daughter! And while some of the flying car effects may look a tad dated now (though only just), the split screen elements are flawless.There are some plotholes to mix in with the fun timeshifting - if Biff created an alternate timeline in the past then the future he returned to wouldn't have been the same one occupied by Marty and the Doc - but are irrelevant among all the fun and imagination of this superior sequel. While it may not be high art, BTTF II does some wonderful things with the medium, and breaches film excellence with a final third that seamlessly blends in the action to events in the first film. In fact, I nearly added another mark to its total... 7/10.",

The first 50 minutes are simultaneously enjoyable and thought-provoking, but, as is the case with most sequels, the interesting elements of the original, the script, is skimped on in order to appeal to money.*Spoiler Start* Going to the \"near-future\" (2015 is closer now than 1985) was interesting, if hokey, but I found its vision of being nonstop gags to get tiresome. Let's face it Blade Runner will probably remain the dominant future in all its darkened neon glory.The return to the Alternate 1985 starts interesting, but things start going downhill when the plot gets in the way.  Zemeckis wanted something dark, but winds up sugarcoating it like he did with the more disturbing segments of Forrest Gump.Returning further to 1955 was a completely out of line and caused the timeline to get so distorted that I threw down my pad and pen that I was taking notes with and snorted in disgust.  That segment was the biggest rash on the script.Worst of all, the end brings us to the lowest installment in the trilogy. My oh my, how things could have been simpler. *Spoiler End*Nonetheless, I found this film more worthwhile than other sequels I've had to see.  Christopher Lloyd saves the day with his almost-typecast acting as Dr. Brown again.  Everyone else, even Michael Fox, winds up being a cardboard prop-up merely spouting words.  The depth of the original was gone.  Zemeckis gets away from his Roger Rabbit shenanigans and creates something unique albeit confusing, but his camera is always looking for the 'money shot'.Overall, an interesting but flawed movie.  Zemeckis would make some improvements with Forrest Gump and Death Becomes Her, but, other than that, he too is on the downhill slide.  3 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "Back at 1985, Robert Zemeckis brought us Back to the Future, a story about Marty McFly who travels back to 1955 in a Delorean his nuclear physicist friend Dr. Emmet Brown made. In order to get back to 85, he has to seek the help of Doc Brown's 1955 counterpart and help his father fall in love with his mother. It became a worldwide box office phenomenon both critically and financially. Later, in 1989, Zemeckis and the other crew planned to make a film trilogy starting with Part 2.Taking place in the cliffhanger from the first movie, Marty McFly, Jennifer, and Doc Brown travel to the year 2015 to prevent Marty's future son from sabotaging his family's future. Meanwhile, their arch nemesis Biff Tannen (his future self) steals the time machine and uses it to alter history for his benefit, creating an alternate version of 1985. So, it's up to Marty and Doc Brown to travel back to 1955 and restore the timeline.Now that it's been thirty years, Part II is an example of a sequel that is very good. Before I give this a lot of praise, yes, it does retread the first film in some ways (which is the only reason why some people don't like this sequel very much), but that's my only nitpick. Everything else is done very well. The story expands on the first movie going into full detail on the whole concept of alternate timelines. It also gives a character backstory to Biff Tannen on why he's been a bully to George McFly back at 1955 due to his wealth. Not to mention it left another cliffhanger (which I'll get to in my review of Part III).That being said, the production design is fantastic from the futuristic 2015 setting to the alternate 1985 setting. The directing and editing is superb and the pacing is very good. Alan Silvestri reprises the themes from the first film in spectacular fashion while introducing some new themes. And the acting from everyone is great. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd continue to shine in their chemistry as Marty McFly and Doc Brown while Thomas F. Wilson gives some complexity to his role as Biff Tannen. Other actors including Elisabeth Shue and Jeffrey Weissman (who replaced Claudia Wells and Crispin Glover as both Jennifer and George McFly) and returning actors including Lea Thompson and James Tolkan as Lorraine McFly and Mr. Strickland do a good job too.Overall, Part II may not be on par with the original, but it's a good sequel in it's own right. Go check it out to those who haven't seen it yet. :)",

            "review_title": "Back to the 80s - the weakest part of the trilogy",
            "content": "SPOILERS So as Marty travels to the future and then again back to the past, so we must return to the 1980s (albeit the end). Returning successfully four years after the original film, \"Back to the Future Part II\" was a step down for all involved. Shot back to back with the superior, and more spoof like, third part, this second encounter was notable more for off screen incidents than for it's obscure storyline. Still, when all is said and done, it's still a part of one of the finest trilogies ever, and easily the best set of films to emerge from the 1980s.Just back from 1955 and wanting to spend time with his recently morphed girlfriend (Elisabeth Shue taking over from Claudia Wells), Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) is rudely interrupted by eccentric friend Dr Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Dragged to 2015, Marty is forced to fight for his family's future. Upon returning home to the 1980s however, Marty fast discovers that events have taken a drastically different course.There's something not quite right about the second part of this trilogy. Attempting to guess about the future, it stretches itself out away from the realistic past and into the realms of dramatic 80s inspired fiction. Dumping 80s nostalgia caf\u00e9s into 2015 (most of us try to forget about it, let alone open a caf\u00e9 to it), it portrays an optimistic love for the period that fashion forgot.Of course, the film isn't helped by off screen conflicts. Whilst you can forgive the recasting of Jennifer after Wells' health made her return impossible, you can't help but feel that perhaps Crispin Glover had the right idea by turning down the chance to reprise the role of Marty's father George. Shown purely from archive footage, Glover's role is played in the future by Jeffrey Weissman. In his defence, Weissman does an acceptable job, but truthfully, it's too easy to miss Glover.Out of those who do return, again Lea Thompson does a strange and quirky job as Marty's mother through three periods. Ultimately though, playing Marty, Marty Jnr and Marlene McFly, it is Michael J Fox who really comes out of this film glowing. He puts on a mature performance and the only shock is that he didn't go on to even greater things after this (up until his illness all but ended his career anyway).Again though, it really is hard to know what to say about \"Back to the Future Part II\" now. More of a stop gap to lead us into the wild west of Part III, the rare joy is spotting moments of trivia (an 8 year old Elijah Wood in 2015 for example), but those are far too few in number.It's a shame really that the second part of this trilogy couldn't have been better. Whilst the first was an intelligent piece of cinema and the third was more of a fun conclusion, this middle section does tend to feel slightly preachy. It attempts to show us what the future would be like, and yet it bases this upon the 1980s. Predicting the future is always a nightmare scenario, and sadly they really don't manage it here. The weakest part of a magnificent trilogy, but a part of it none the less.",

Not a descent into the world of 'Mad Max' imposed by the 'Biff Tanens', who are destroying us with their greed.

The Original was a masterpiece but the sequel which revisits the first didn't have that potential of its predecessor; I am assuming it never happened.Back to the Future 2 (Spoilers******) After the sensational movie 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' director Robert Zemeckis was thinking for another hit. But he doesn't know what next, until he thinks of his own ONE AND ONLY best block buster 'Back to the Future'. After the original creator Bob Gale given a nice story which was set up in the 1960's, Zemeckis decided to make it in another way messing all of them around, insulting the first movie and he finally succeeds. And that was 'Back to the Future'- Part II and III.Marty was forced to go to the future, in which he discovers that he can be a millionaire if he takes a sports magazine to his original time slot. But later his idea was taken by old Biff who steals the time traveling car and went to 1955. Will Marty this time smart enough to take up the challenge. If so how? Scripted by Bob Gale for the story of Robert Zemeckis and himself, revisits the original film from different angles with the two Martys in 1955. The movie is far from the original but Michael J. Fox makes it to be in touch. He has done a brilliant performance. Especially in those 1955 scenes with the Biff and early Marty. Even though the script was bad, the actors tried to cover the story's defects with their talents. Christopher Lloyd, Mary Steenburgen and Thomas F. Wilson did their nice work, they really saved the movie.I missed Crispin Glover as George McFly the most, but Jeffrey Weissman did his best to become Crispin Glover as well as George McFly! It was Crispin's departure that made the writers to change the movie this way, but Zemeckis had a chance to make it well, but he blew it anyway.. bending into another stupid sequel.All in all its a great miss and a great won for the previous movie fans, but in deeply, truly a Big disaster for a Great fan like me.\"I gave this movie 0 out of 100!\"",

They have the entire history and future of the world to play around with and somehow they keep going back to 1955. Which was fine in the first movie, but to revisit it again in the second movie is just overkill. If you have a time machine, would you not want to visit the dinosaurs, or want to meet Chingis Khan or Jezus, or perhaps see the world a million years into the future rather than spending Gigawatts of power to visit 1955? I get that it makes sense in the story, but the creators wrote the story... so why not make it interesting instead? I think this entire movie could have been set in the future and it would have been better.I also find the entire thing too stressful and hard to enjoy. As a viewer you're constantly worried about what they're going to do next to mess with the timeline. The characters are constantly in a hurry despite the fact that they have a time machine. Doc Brown is smart enough to invent time travel, but apparently dumb enough to put the fate of the entire galaxy in the hands of a teenager that obviously doesn't have the slightest clue about quantum mechanics.Also, the special effects are dated.The movie is fun if you're a kid, but as an adult it's pretty lame in my humble opinion.",

In this film Marty and Doc go to 2015, where they see flying cars, self lacing shoes, and all kinds of stuff like that. Well I'm looking out the window right now and I don't see that. But anyways old Biff Tannen (Thomas F Wilson) goes back to 1955 after stealing the DeLorean time machine and causes major problems to the time line. Therefore Marty and Doc have to go back to 1955 to fix all of it. It's really hard to explain but when you watch the film it makes more sense. This Back to the Future film relies more on the suspense element as it gets into the second half.

I try not to include spoilers so i won't include any story relation but i will say that after seeing the first, you most definitely have to check out the second and maybe even the third.

            "content": "Many critics of this sequel probably find this effort unnecessary and others may just find it overly confusing. The streamlined, comparatively simple plot of the first \"Back to the Future\"(85) gives way here to a messy 'to and fro' time travel angle in which the heroes just can't seem to get it right. With the audience needing to concentrate all their energy on keeping track of the plot twists, much of the entertainment value could be lost. There's validity to this argument; however, I, for one, admire dense plotting, especially in science fiction tales - the more complex, the better, I say. It shows me someone was making the effort and wanted the viewer to wrap his mind around concepts not usually encountered.In this follow-up, Marty (Fox) goes to his future (year 2015 or 30 years in his future) to help his own son. As usual, the filmmakers overestimated progress, since we now know the flying cars in this future will not come about 10 years from now. The motivations seem haphazard; in the 1st pic, Marty went back in time by accident; here, he and the Doc purposely travel in time and manage to make a mess of things. Their arch-nemesis, Biff (Wilson), steals a future book back to 1955 and changes the course of history. The revised 'present' of 1985 becomes a nightmarish surreal world of anarchy and decay. With us so far? Now the heroes again go back to 1955 to correct things. Here's where things get really messy: Marty & the Doc are running around in 1955 while their counterparts from the 1st Back to the Future are also there in the background doing their thing. So now we're seeing the same scenes of the previous film from a slightly new perspective (from the p.o.v.of this movie's Marty & Doc).Wow. The filmmakers either wanted to dazzle the audience or drive them insane with this mind-warping running about. The drawback to the final 3rd of the movie is that most viewers will expend all their energy trying to remember scenes of the first film. But you really have to admire the creative attempt of metaphysically snaking back to the events of the previous film, seeing it from the inside out. Even if the whole Back to the Future trilogy becomes needlessly complex thanks to this chapter. The next & final sequel was filmed at the same time as this and was more back to basics.",

            "content": "Chicago Cubs fans across the nation clutched their copies of Back to the Future Part II when it looked like our Cubbies might make the film's World Series prophecy come true last October. The vision the film predicted didn't happen, of course, and we are all still perpetually humming \"there's always next year\". It's hard to believe this Cubs fan neglected to see this movie last year as I kept hearing \"We're going to do it, it's in Back to the Future\". All Cubs fandom aside, this was a great film to see, and I'm glad I can finally add it to the list of classics that I have seen, even if I waited too long.Back to the Future Part II reunites our unstoppable team of Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) in a journey to save Marty and his now girlfriend/future wife Jennifer's (Elizabeth Shue) children. Doc crashes, literally, the reunion between the two teen lovers after Marty's first trip through time with harrowing news. Doc informs the lovebirds that they marry in the future, which thrills them, but then informs them that there is a serious problem with the lives of their future children, and Marty's help is needed to thwart their futures. Doc has painstakingly worked through each moment in Marty McFly Jr.'s life and realized the moment that he went off track, October 21st, 2015. All that he needs is for Marty to intervene, act as his son and confront the bully that pushes him into the less than desirable situation and his life will be fine. A simple enough proposal, which of course doesn't work out the way Doc had planned. Marty gets greedy and buys a sports almanac to take with him to the past with the idea that he will place bets on all the winners and become rich. Doc vehemently disregards this idea and puts Marty in his place, morally. Unfortunately for the world, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) finds the almanac, discovers the DeLorean doubling as a time machine, and travels back to 1955, where Marty just left and gives the book to a relative with a less prominent moral compass. Unbeknownst are Biff's travels to Doc and Marty who travel back to 1985 to find their home in a depressing state, and their own lives in complete disarray. To reverse the curse, Doc comes up with a plan to send he and Marty back to 1955 so Marty can take to book from Griff (Thomas F. Wilson), the complicated part of this plan is to not disrupt the initial journey Marty took to 1955. Since time is a continuum, Marty's first trip to 1955 is taking place just the same as it did before, so it becomes imperative for neither Marty nor Doc to see their past/future selves and prevent further disaster. Watching the duo glide through time on an ever evolving mission to save themselves and humanity was just as enjoyable to watch in this sequel as it was in the original film. One can't wait to see what happens next, as the end of the film guarantees we will see the team again.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd look just as comfortable and believable in this story as they did in the first. It was fun to see their chemistry and watch them think up their plots then set them in motion throughout the film. The adaptability of the two actors shows their versatility and comes off so naturally for the audience. There are, of course, supporting actors in this film, but most of the film takes place with just these two on screen so chemistry is crucial, and was achieved in this film to optimal level.The overarching moral lesson in Back to the Future Part II is pretty clear; don't cheat the world just to make a buck, or, millions upon millions of bucks in Marty's ideal situation. Doc was right to dissuade Marty from taking the sports almanac with him to 1985, even if some of us may have cheered Marty's idea. One should not take advantage of invention and use it for personal gain. This can be thought of more deeply in everyday life as well. This message definitely makes one think about their position in life and the potential of privilege associated with that position. Doc also reminds us in this film, as he did in the first film, that one should not know too much about their own future. He remains steadfast in the idea that we shouldn't be privy to what will happen in our own lives in the future. This is a great reminder for humanity to embrace the unknown. Life is all we are guaranteed once we're here and we may as well make the most of the mystery that we get to see unfold.Back to the Future Part II is a fun and engaging film suitable for the whole family. I miss the movies of the 80's that drew the teenage crowd but could still be enjoyed with your parents on the couch Sunday evening. A good lesson and a great story make for an enjoyable film experience. I will certainly be tuning in to the third installment of this series and hope it will be as enjoyable as the first two. I'm still waiting for a movie that doesn't show such a ghastly future with crazy fashions and hair, but I suppose, everything looked ghastly at one point or another.",

Things build up for awhile in this new 1985, until Marty must go back to 1955.Now we are following Marty on the day in which the Enchantment Under the Sea dance takes place. Marty needs to get something from Biff that will affect 1985 and return them back to the normal future...At the end is another twist and it ends. Now read a review for the first film. Then read this one again. You'll notice how calm and spectacular the first film sounds, and in a way, how lousy this film sounds. Don't get me wrong, this is a wonderful film, but it lost it's magic. The first film had something so deeply special, and once the story becomes complex, time consumes the humor and magic of this film (except for some moments in 2015 that will remind you of the first film!!)

Also the story is a lot weaker here, sure, the book had influences that went further, but it never felt as engaging.In general this movie feels a lot more silly and cartoonish in it's portrayal of characters, whereas the first also had it's silly moments, most characters were played a bit more straight than here. Especially the 1985 alternate timeline was almost a parody. There are more jokes, and just more comedy in general.Now it's interesting to me that most of the modern day stuff we see or remember from BTTF is the Mattel hover board, the Nike auto lacing shoes and the weird upside-down Pepsi. It shows the power of marketing I guess, but the product placement was heavier here than I expected. That said, the products earn their notoriety for being incredibly cool products, with beautiful designs.At times we de have some rehashing of plot, another race against the clock like the last movie. Involving the same characters. Doc had less to do as well as Marty took most of the plot.The makeup for the older versions is alright, but it never sells it fully but in a sillier movie like this it didn't feel that far out of place.Regarding the prediction of how 2015 that of course already hilarious. Sadly though, I wish they were right (most things at least) Who doesn't want that hoverboard...Regarding a plot point, maybe I didn't hear it right but in the future when Marty is a loser because of a accident, that never got solved right? By trying to fix the children they only tried to treat the symptoms, not the cause. The other plot took over before that even started though. Maybe we see this in the 3rd movie.And about that, the end of the movie ends on a ''to be continued'' and this adds to the lesser impact this movie had on me. It does really feel a movie to fill the time between the finale. Contrary to something like Empire Strikes Back that has more significance in it's trilogy.Looking forward to the finale and see how they neatly wrap this up.",

However, left in the hands of the creative team of the original, Back to the Future Part II is one of the greatest sequels in cinematic history.Robert Zemeckis is a brilliant director, and with this film he gave us something completely different from the original (with a film that could easily have been a copy-and-paste of the original) that not only expands upon what the original did, but gives throwbacks to it. It's a time travel movie that's not afraid to go in every direction and, when it goes back to scenes from the previous movie, it's done so seamlessly and beautifully that it flows just as naturally as the original versions of the scenes in the first movie.Again, the chemistry from all the main actors is spot-on, the humor is on point and the tone of the film is exactly what it needs to be. It feels right at home with the original in terms of the tone and pacing, making it a near-perfect sequel. Of course, with a story like this there's going to be continuity errors (just minor ones), but honestly everything else works so seamlessly together that the continuity errors matter very little, if at all.",

But after watching it 5 or 6 times it became one of the better action/adventure films I'd seen.  The main appeal for me was how it picked up right where part 1 ended.  Though four years later in real time, the actors had to put back on the same outfits, do the same lines and be in the same setting (Martys driveway).  Most of us remember Docs \"theres gotta be something done about your kids\" that ended the last movie.  They head off to 2015 and after Martys business with his kids is taken care of in an elaborate chase on flying skateboards (I loved those things), he buys a book detailing the outcomes of sporting events from the previous 50 years.  Doc is outraged at Martys desire to take it back and place bets to fatten his bank account and throws it away.  It ends up in the hands of our favorite bully Biff (now 77) and he reeks havoc with it after commandeering the briefly unoccupied Delorean.  All the mayhem Biff causes leads Marty and Doc back in time to fix it, and oddly enough...they end up back at the exact same week in 1955 of Martys first adventure!  How convenient!  It was the only way the filmmakers could use the truly clever idea of re-witnessing the first movie from another angle as Marty has to do work out of view of his \"other self.\" Though totally unbelievable that Biff would choose that date to go back to so he could give himself the sports book, its extremely well done and something we've never seen in a movie.  But as soon as the problem with Biff is squared away, theres a dramatic set up for a third movie!  The groan let out by the audience I was with was warranted as it was a little annoying. As far as the future scenes go, they were pretty impressive.  The expected high tech gadgets are featured and they'll definately raise your eyebrows. The overall effects are great as many of the actors have to do scenes with themselves sometimes, like when Fox plays 3 at once.  Theres also a lot of scenes from the original film parodied here and the only way to get em is to have seen part 1 numerous times.  From what I heard Shue replaced Wells as Jennifer because of \"personal problems\" and Glover didnt show up because he wanted Michael J. Fox type money.  He got it when he sued Speilberg for using footage of him from part 1 without permission.  What a weiner.  So though not as good as the first trip, this is still enjoyable for film fans who like movies that keep them on their toes.",

Fox ) and his girlfriend are whisked into the future to the year 2015, where Marty must tangle with a teen rogue named Griff, who's obviously the descendant of Biff, the first Future film's bully. Marty foils Griff and his group when he jumps on an air-foil skateboard that flies him through town at rakish speeds with the loser bullies beaten again. Marty gets a money- making brainstorm before hopping in the time-traveling DeLorean, and he purchases a sports almanac. He figures that back in 1985 he'll be able to place sure- fire bets using the published sports scores of the games that are yet to happen. Unfortunately for Marty, Dr. Brown disapproves of his betting scheme -- he feels too much messing with time is very dangerous -- and he tosses the almanac. A hidden Biff overhears the discussion about the almanac, sees it get tossed out, and grabs it. Thus begins a time-traveling swirl to make the head spin. Biff swipes the DeLorean, heads back to 1955, and with the help of the unerring almanac, bets his way to power. The now-altered \"Biff world\" has turned into a nightmarish scene with Biff the mogul, residing in a Vegas-styled pleasure palace and running everything. It's all our hero Marty can do to pull the pieces together this time, as he must jump between three generations of intertwined time travel. The end of Back to the Future, Part 2 introduces its sequel as the zany professor has already time-dashed away to the Wild West of the late 1800s and invites Marty into a new adventure.",

Fact is, the first Back to the future was so ace that we WANTed another, we know we did. And the complexity of Part II, that attracted so much of the criticism, is what makes it special. It's really thoughtful - the writers straddle the line between predictions and plugs, making excellent jokes about the future.

However, when Biff goes back to 1955 and sees his former self, there's no problem for either him or his young self?There's also a slight problem I had in the almanac retrieval. We are to believe that Marty's been locked in the garage for many hours until Biff comes out to drive to the dance. Since Biff is unaware that Marty is in the garage, why can't Marty have simply taken some large object into the back seat with him and hit the unsuspecting Biff on the back of the head with it when Biff sits down in front of him, taking the  almanac back?\n**** spoilers end ****That said, this is much fun - spinning out of clever ideas - just not as sentimental or heart-felt as the first.",

It's not as humorous as the first, but it is much more creative and is still a fun time.As shown at the end of Back to the Future, Marty McFly (Micheal J. Fox) has just returned from 1955, saving his parents lives, along with his own. Everything seems great, until Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) pulls up on the front driveway of Marty's house in the DeLorean time machine. He tells Marty that they must go to 2015 to save Marty's future life! He leaves with his girlfriend Jennifer into the future. After repairing the damage done by Griff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), Biff Tannnen's grandson, Marty buys a sports almanac that disrupts the space time continuem. While Marty and Doc are somewhere else, Biff steals the almanac and the DeLorean, goes to 1955 and gives the book to a young version of himself, and returns. When Doc and Marty reappear in 1985, they find that it has become a corrupt criminal empire with Biff as the head. Now they must return to 1955 and stop Biff from getting the almanac, if they can get their first!The movie doesn't really introduce any new cast members but their are some nice twists. Fox plays four different parts: Marty McFly, Marty McFly from 2015, Marty McFly Jr. and his future daughter! It looks like he was having a great time playing multiple roles, as the tradition carried on into the next sequel. Jennifer has a bigger part in Part II, but I preferred Claudia Wells to Elisabeth Shue.The creativity in this film sparkels. I love the sequences in 2015, showing all the future inventions like video waiters, Hover Boards, and a little pizza that, when microwaved, can turn into a large size in 4 seconds. Plus flying cars, holographic dog kennels, the list goes on and on. It's really fun to watch. Plus the visual effects are even better than those from the original film.The only problem I had with this movie is the humor. It's just not as funny as the first movie. Marty is not as funny and Crispin Glover is sorely missed as Marty's dad. Also, Biff Tannen is a high-school bully. It's a little over the top that he would turn into a vicious murderer that \"owns the police\" and turns Hill Valley into Hell. But nowadays, maybe it's a little more believable.All in all, this movie is really good. Anyone who saw the first should enjoy it a lot but I would reccomend seeing the first one and then the sequel if you have not seen either. A fun movie.",

I love it to death though as it is definitely the most ambitious in the series. We travel to the future year of 2015 where there are flying cars, hoverboards, and self-drying jackets (I love retro-futurism), we explore an altered and corrupted version of 1985, and we also get to rewitness some crucial moments from the first film in 1955.I don't think it's as solidly put together as its preceding film, which stands as one of my all time favorites, but it's everything I wanted out of a \"Part II\": more time traveling hijinx with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd).ILM also broke new ground with this film with the ability to digitally composite shots together with multiple actors playing past and future versions of themselves. The makeup on some of the characters is not the best but it gets the job done. We also get to see Michael J. Fox in drag as he plays a version of his character's future daughter so that's kind of cool I guess.A little bit too much plot but I don't think it's necessarily a detriment in this case as it's all made very easy and digestible to follow through expository dialogue from the Doc, and that has to be commended.A great follow-up that I definitely recommend if you were a fan of the first film and want some more time traveling adventures. Obviously don't watch if you didn't see the first as you will be completely lost. And if you do watch this one, might as well complete the trilogy with the third movie as this one ends on a little bit of a cliffhanger, and I also find the third to be enjoyable as well.",

It picks up directly where the original leaves off. This time, Marty, Doc Brown and Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer, travel to the year 2015 in order to prevent certain disasters with Marty's kids. While in the future, Marty buys a sports almanac (50 years of sports statistics 1950-2000) which he wants to take back to 1985 with the hopes of winning a lot of money. Unfortunately, old Biff Tannen manages to grab the book after Doc Brown throws it away, and steals the Delorean to take it to the future (or the past?) Marty, Doc and Jennifer arrive in 1985 again only to find it has been tampered with, and their little town of Hill Valley has become a bigtime war zone. Seems Biff was the cause of it, as he won a huge amount of money in his early years which caused him to become a millionaire tycoon. Marty investigates and him and Doc need to go back to 1955 in order to repair the damage done to 1985! (I hope you get it so far) In 1955, Marty tracks down young Biff this time in order to get the almanac and destroy it so the normal timeline can be restored. He also has to be careful not to run into his other \"self\", because he is in 1955 on the same day that he goes back to the future in the original movie. Well, this movie certainly is clever, no doubt about that, but it isn't at all lighthearted as the original, it is a dark movie, especially when the action shifts to the alternate 1985. For a movie that in reality, takes place 4 years after the first movie, it pulls off the continuity nicely. The acting is great, especially by Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox. Elizabeth Shue replaces Claudia Wells as Jennifer and Crispin Glover is only in scenes from the original movie.

At the time of the film's release, it was incredibly cool to see 2015, which is shown to us in the film. I remember every viewing of this trilogy and a clear feeling that has remained to this day - Back to the Future 2 is the best of all three films for me. Precisely because you see the future there. Excellent visual solutions, by the way, allowed the film to be nominated for an Oscar for best effects. The scriptwriters and the director perfectly saw what their world of the future would be like, paying attention to details. And the legendary pink skate that flew straight through the air will forever remain a childhood dream for millions of children of that time.The actors' acting is on top again. It doesn't matter that the actress playing Jennifer was replaced, it didn't affect the perception at all. The actress perfectly fit into the team, making her heroine a part of the universe Back to the Future.Marty McFly appears as an older copy of himself. Makeup helps to show age. After all, it's been 30 years. But the main thing that I noticed for myself, the actor's acting is his eyes. Fox did a great job with the image of the father of the family, who has already lived a life, has seen a lot. I think it's the actor's merit to convey the age of the hero in this way.Dr. Brown is in his repertoire. Still wild and purposeful. Lloyd shines on the screen, not letting you take your eyes off him for a second. He is here on a mission to save the future of his younger friend's family, once again showing friendship what it should be.Tanons are colorful as always, unpleasant, as befits antiheroes. Thomas Wilson more than copes with several roles at once, giving each character its own uniqueness.The movie is quite dynamic. Adventures switch from one event to another, and the explanation of confusing moments with time travel allows you not to lose the thread of the narrative. And of course, the sequel was obliged to raise the bar, which was done when, in the interweaving of storylines, the heroes of this film were not supposed to meet themselves from the past. And every scene that was almost frame-by-frame reproduced is a pleasure when you realize how responsibly the creators of the picture approached this work.The music is back on top. To this day, Alan Silvestri's melody makes you smile mentally when footage from the film pops up in front of your eyes.The movie is bright and interesting. It is perfect for family viewing, giving an excellent couple of hours in the piggy bank of life.9 out of 10.",

            "content": "SPOILERS Okay, no type of sequel can surpass the original Back to the Future, back I must admit, this one comes pretty darn close. There are a lot, I mean a lot, of deja-vu moments. Also, if you really think, there are a lot of movie parodies in this movie. For example, when Marty confronts Biff in the bathtub, the camera angles are exactly like a scene in one of the James Bond movies. I have not the faintest idea which one it parodies, but still, I know it parodies a Bond film. At least I think it parodies a Bond film. Anyway, this is a good sequel. The plot of it, however, is a bit more complicated than the original. The original had a hard plot to follow, too. The worst part is to fit it into words.Here is the plot. This film takes place right after the first one left off. Marty McFly, Doc, and Marty's girlfriend named Jennifer go to the year 2015. Doc wants to change the future because Marty's son is going to go to jail. Doc puts sleeping gas on Jennifer because she was asking too many questions. Marty changes the future and makes sure his son doesn't go to jail. He also buys a sports almanac that tells all of the sports wins form 1950-2000. Doc throws it away. Then, an old Biff, who was Marty's father's nemesis, takes the almanac. A sleeping Jennifer is taken by the police and taken to her house. She is rescued by Doc, but she faints when she sees her future self. Then Biff takes the time machine car and goes to the past. Marty, Doc, and Jennifer go back to the past and realize it has become a horrible place. Worst of all, Marty's father is dead and Biff is Marty's mother's husband. He is also rich. Marty finds out that Biff has the almanac. Marty and Doc go back to 1955 to get the almanac. Marty gets the almanac from Biff. The future is changed. Then, Doc is struck by lighting and goes back to the year 1895. Marty gets help from another Doc to get him back.Overall, yes, it is a cliffhanger, but if two and three would have been one whole film it would have been over two hundred minutes. It is a fantastic film that anyone who is a fan of the original Back to the Future should, actually must see this film. It would not make sense without this film. Although it is confusing at times, like Biff going back in time to give the almanac to himself thus making him a rich man, and it is definitely not as good as the original, it is still one of the best sequels out there.9/10Recommended Films: Back to the Future.",

The answer is yes, therefore, hindering practically the rest of the movie after this event occurred obsolete. The DeLorean that old man Biff drove should've never returned to Marty McFly and Doctor Brown at all.

            "review_title": "Hits The Ground Running",
            "content": "BACK TO THE FUTURE PART II hits the ground running like few films as our heroes thrust themselves into 2015. It's a visual treat as teen time traveler Marty McFly (a distinctly non-teen Michael J. Fox) defies gravity on his hoverboard, encounters futuristic marvels and, in a memorable few moments, visits a retro '80s cafe. The fun spirit of the original lives on. The film takes a darker turn, however, with Marty forced to alter history to prevent the rise of family nemesis Biff Tannen. Suddenly Marty's dodging bullets and leaping from buildings instead of jamming on the guitar (though he finds time to do that, too).This film is quite different from the others in the popular trilogy, but it is also, a number of ways, superior to what came before and (particularly) what came after. It benefits immensely from a wildly imaginative script. Rather than rehashing the original, as so many sequels do, director Robert Zemeckis ingeniously intertwined the two films by having the characters literally revisit the events of the first entry. BACK TO THE FUTURE PART II is complex, to be sure, but not so complex so as to detract from the viewer's enjoyment. It is a thinking person's time travel adventure, one with enough to satisfy multiple viewings.Most other areas of the film hold up well. The Oscar-nominated special effects, as touched on earlier, remain superb nearly two decades later. And because it was made before the rise of CGI, the effects and stunts have a homegrown appeal that is increasingly difficult to find today. Fox is strong in the lead, but Christopher Lloyd's eccentric Doc Brown again nearly steals the show. And Zemeckis' immense directorial talents are on full display as he knows just when to pick up the action and when to give us a chance to absorb all we've just seen.",

But I think that this was somewhat of a plus point because when you are bored you can sort out things in your head. And the concept did need some sorting out.I guess that's all. Keep in mind that this film was released in 1989. So things are definitely weird when looking at the future from that point in time. It's rather funny really.",

Impressive for a movie that was made in 1989, this movie was way ahead of it's time. Also who doesn't love the teaser of the third film at the end to fill our holes of the cliffhanger. Just seeing how much after credits has been a part of the 21st century, seeing a teaser for the next movie immediately when the movie ends was refreshening and original just because the writers knew audiences wouldn't wait to see the third part and I wasn't disappointed with it. Overall, a masterpiece and definitely one of the best sequels ever made.

I just love the uniqueness of each setting, and all the characters in the different years.

But i can understand why people are disappointed that this film changes time period to often and recreates much of the first film. The first forty minutes of this film are incredible and the vision of the future is wonderful. It's very far fetched in an 80's way and presents a vision of a future with flying cars, hydrating jackets, and of course, hover boards. The effects of the film showing the futuristic Hill Valley are incredible and do not look dated, even in 2006. It would be a futuristic world that most people would love to live in. The hover board scene and the futuristic caf\u00e9 80's are presented well, as is the futuristic Macfly home. I love the scene when Marty is walking to the Cafe 80's and we see a women coming out of an instant silicone breast implant shop, now that's a future world that any man would love! I also like the theme of how one event in a persons life can have such a dramatic impact, i.e Marty Jr breaking into the court house with Griff's gang, Marty agreeing to Needles scheme and getting busted by his Japanese boss, Marty getting into a car accident and flushing his music career away. This movie is very dark and scary because it paints a picture of a life ruined by mistakes, and it made me realize that there were single events in my own life that affected me in a positive and negative manner, and makes you wonder how your life would be different if certain events had not occurred. I try not to get caught up in the negativity of this and try to remember a great quote by Doc Browne. It's at the end of the third one when he say's something like no one's future is predetermined, so make your's a good one.Well a digressed from my review of Back to the Future II, so i'll continue now. This movie was great but could have been a lot better if they had just kept the whole thing in the future. The studio probably would not give them enough money because of all the special effects. Money problems also caused a futuristic slam ball scene to be deleted, which was too bad. The film is not horrible when it goes back to the alternate 1985 and then 1955, but the 1955 part is recycled and is not fun. It's essentially back to the future one again with different camera angles and a slightly different plot. Also the absence of Crispin Glover due to a contract dispute was a major loss, because we don't get to see the interaction between him and Biff in the future. The original script called for Marty and Doc to go back to the 60's and have George as a college professor, and Lorraine as a flower child, but this was scrapped because Glover asked for too much money. This would have been better because then we would have gotten to see a new time period, instead of old recycled material. Still overall this film is good, and i would recommend it to anyone who liked the first one.",

Although some people I went to the theatre with didn't like it because they got very confused about what was going on and following everything, I kept up with all of it and really appreciated how complicated it was.The one weakness upon rewatching it recently for the first time in decades which stood out was the very beginning when they first arrive in the future with Griff. It was a little bit \"too\" goofy and went over the top, unlike classic BTTF subplots, which always seem to toe the line just right to prevent that.However, my favorite part of this movie is definitely the very end. I think that's why I liked it so much. It was awesome and suspenseful how the car pulled up just after the storm and how that whole scenario played out, in addition to the twenty minutes that led up to it with Marty completing his mission back to 1955 undercover. If not for the first half hour of this movie, it would be just about perfect.8/10",

            "content": "Sixteen years on and I can remember it like yesterday...which is handy because the real yesterday was 'king dreadful. I was swaggering down Causeway Head, Penzance's premier street as its the only one that contains a cinema AND a chip shop - in my hand a thick wedge of pornographic magazines. My Destination? 'The Matrix', an incomplete garage where myself and two friends stored a hoard bought using homeless men given extra for cigarettes. As I walked past the Savoy I saw a coming soon poster for the Back to the Future sequel. I had no idea it was even being made. It was a fantastic moment. The original was one of my all time favourite things and the only one I could enjoy with my Mother in the room. When I finally saw it 3 or 4 months later I was entertained but held reservations which hold up to this day and that, lucky people that you are, I'll share with you now. Immediately it was apparent that there were some problems. One, Claudia Wells had become Elizabeth Shue and no-one had noticed - worrying because it was the original actresses good looks that had effectively saved Marty's bacon when his assertion that \"she's beautiful\" had caused him to whip out the clock-tower flyer with its precious future information. Two, Chrispin Glover had chosen not to participate. Why was this allowed to happen? He was a key supporting character in the first film and though they could clearly get round it with a lot of soft long distance shots and layers of makeup his absence left a hole in the ensuing two episodes. I'd love to see the original paradox script which presumably had him in it. Three, it was too complicated and so packed with plot that you never really had the opportunity to sit back and breathe it in like the first film. You know it's been retrospectively plotted when you have to insert a scene into the original epilogue to make it work. Four, continuity. Michael J Fox's appearance in the 1985 film is a matter of record as its, er, on film, so you'd think it wouldn't be a stretch for just one person to observe that the diminutive man child had different hair. For those of you that think this is pedantry, YES IT IS and wacha going'do about it? Some nights all I can think about is a digitally tinkering but thats a different subject entirely and not something we should go into here. So part II is good fun, cleverly conceived and all the rest of it but it just doesn't have the heart of the first and of course it doesn't really work as a self-contained instalment because its essentially half a film - a 108 minute setup for the better, more satisfying part III. 'Tis a comedy lets not forget so its worth mentioning some good jokes - Nixton's fifth term in the alternate future, the black and decker hydrated pizza, Doc Brown's \"Women!\" monologue and of course \"Ooh la la!\" OK, the product placement is disgraceful but you can use the 'minority report' defence (which presumably the producers saw coming) and argue that it adds a real-worldly dimension to the future. That said, Pepsi did very well out of the futures and that would be fine 'cept it tastes terrible. Its nice that you have a sequel that does something different from its predecessor and credits the audience with a bit of intelligence, plus it was blatantly robbed of the best-visual Oscar (went to the Abyss would you believe).

In the case of Back to the Future 2, it works in some levels, but the recycled ideas of the original is an obvious case of either fan service, or The Bobs didn't know exactly where to go with this one. I can tell you one thing, though, that as a kid I was anxiously awaiting this film, and I remember being so excited at the theater with my dad. I remember rushing home excitedly to tell my mom about how great it was. Oh, the simple minds of youth.The film takes place exactly where the first one left off, but reenacted so it doesn't quite play exactly like the end of the first film but it worked enough. The destination is immediately in the year 2015, with Marty, Doc and Jennifer flying in the Delorean in a traffic of speeding, flying cars. Jennifer starts to ask questions and Doc immediately knocks her out with some spray. In all actuality, this is a way to get Jennifer out of the film for time being as The Bobs couldn't come up with a good storyline for her. However, I give them credit, because what happens later was a very good scene.Basically Marty has to take the role of one of kids' in the future to not participate in Griff's gang (Griff is the son of Biff, but who he conceived him with is never explained). I guess Marty Jr. winds up in jail, his sister bails him out and they both spend like twenty years in the slammer. Now how this effects Marty, I don't know. Wouldn't it be easier for Doc to say, I don't know, look Marty up like Marty asked him to and warn him about his son's participation? Wouldn't that be easier than to nab Marty in the present just to wind up being chased by Griff and his gang?Remember how I said it used recycled ideas from the first one? Yeah, that's the hoverboard sequence. I mean, almost scene by scene is nearly an exact replica of the first film. I like the fact that the hoverboards can't go over water, but wouldn't that make Marty sink into the pool? Anyway, the bullies fly in the air and through the building and somehow this gets them arrested. I don't see how. People get arrested for accidents in 2015? While I'm at it, when did Marty get so upset from being called chicken? I know it's a plot device but that really came out of nowhere. Oh well.My biggest problem with 2015 is even though I like the ideas that was put into it, I certainly didn't like the how it was written. Besides the obvious strange plot devices, it just seemed to me that the performances felt forced, as if they were trying harder to be funny. I'm not going to lie, though, that one of the better scenes in the film was when Jennifer was sneaking through her future home. My favorite scene here is when Marty's Asian boss yells out, \"MCFLY!\" Definitely the best scene in the movie, and perhaps my favorite of the whole series. Too funny.The filmmakers must acknowledged that the whole \"something's gotta be done about your kids\" plot was a little too out there, so it focused on older Biff giving a sports almanac to younger Biff. This is what altered 1985, because somehow older Biff knew how to operate a time machine and go back to any year he wanted as if everyone knew how to operate a time machine. Anyway, the alternate 1985 was a little too over the top, but I really did enjoy the scenes in Biff's home and how he tries to murder Marty. It separated itself from the rest of the series and really showed the filmmakers were going for something different.The 1955 stuff, well.... it's basically a total rehash of the first Back to the Future. I did enjoy these scenes, especially watching Marty trying to get back the almanac from Biff which created a pretty tense scene between Biff in his car and Marty on his hoverboard. However, Doc's car being struck by lightning without going 88 miles per hour was something of an orthodox. If that was the case, then in the first film why didn't Marty just wait at the street light where the lightning struck rather then going 88 miles per hour if the lightning could send him home anyway? I know The Bobs explained, but it's still a plot hole.Back to the Future 2 is still a worthy sequel but it doesn't pack the same punch of the first film. I can watch the first film over and over again, as it has the right pace and the story was told wonderfully. I wish the same could be said about the sequel, but it's better than most sequels out there.",

            "content": "Time travel movies are risky, they usually have logic problems that are noticeable. The thing about Back To The Future II is that it takes head-on potential continuity quirks and makes an entire movie about it. Set minutes after the end of Back To The Future, the smash hit of 1985, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) takes Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and his girlfriend Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue) 30 years into the future to help their future children out of a potential mess. While in the future, Marty buys a sports almanac to try to make a dollar when returning to 1985. However, the older Biff gets to the sports book first, takes it to 1955 with the time machine, altering the future. Marty and Doc do not know that, however, until a meeting describes what is going on. The suburban Hill Valley turns into a sleazy Las Vegas-type city, run by Biff, turning the sports book into cash to build an empire. Other terrible things happen to the characters we knew from the first movie. The last half of the movie takes place where the first movie ended, at the \"Enchanted Under the Sea\" dance, as Marty tries to steal the sports book back from the young Biff. Not as revolutionary as the first movie, this second installment has the most interesting story and the best action sequences as Biff and Marty zig and zag through a conveniently placed tunnel. There is some over-the-top acting, but it's well placed and works well in this fantasy movie. The ending of the movie set's up the third movie as if they were filming them together.... oh, they were. Flimed at the same time as Back To The Future III, it seamlessly flows into the beginning of the final chapter of the Back To the Future trilogy with another fun look at playing with time.",

I would tell anyone to rent it and give it a few veiws. It certainly is a great film. It did not catch all audiences like Star Wars or Titanic or Godfather. But it is the best Time Travel Film to date.Marty Mcfly returns from his previous adventure only to meet Doc again the next morning to go to the year 2015 to save his future. He makes a mistake and buys a sports almanac and changes the future. Now he must return to 1955 to save the Future and get the almanac back from Biff without running into his other self.I Didn't want to spoil the entire movie for you.

            "content": "*Mild Spoilers* I couldn't wait to see this one in the cinema in 1989. I loved the original and watched it countless times on video. Anyone who watched the original knew that they were going to do a sequel when \"To be continued\" flashed up on the screen, great I thought, not only had I just watched a fantastic film they were going to do another! So I awaited the follow up with much excitement, it took quite a while as it didn't appear until four years later but this didn't seem so bad when I found out they were actually making two Back to the Future follow ups at the same time. The minute the film started doubts began to enter my mind, for a start the actress playing Marty's girlfriend was different so they had to reshoot the ending of the last one, then the old actors playing multiple roles trick appeared, with actors playing themselves older, younger, their sons, their fathers, their mothers, their alternate selves etc etc, very clever, or so they think, I personally didn't want to see Michael J Fox in drag playing his daughter, or finding out he was a complete loser in the future with a complete idiot of a son, what a downer. Also most of the film seems to be just commercials for various products, Texaco, Mattel, Nintendo and most blatantly Pepsi, the worst part was when Doc actually orders Marty to \"order a Pepsi\", I half expected him to say \"and remember folks you can order a Pepsi from the foyer, too!\", actually this movie must have the most product placement in any film even more than the James Bond films, although I do realise there was some in the brilliant original too. I will say that there was some very clever time travel stuff going on though, going back to 1955 \"again!\" was a brilliant idea, I enjoyed this section much more than the horrible 2015 section. At least the producers tried to make a decent follow up actually if anything they appear to be trying too hard. Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd are very good in reprising their best known roles and so are the supporting cast. Elisabeth Shue doesn't fare so well, appearing in a very dodgy wig and for most of the film the makers don't seem to know what to do with her character, so she spends most of the film getting knocked out or fainting so they don't have to bother with her anymore. All in all while not being a complete disaster Back to the Future was none the less a major disappointment. ***6/10***",

Fox he is also skillful guy.Movie has so many twists and so many breathtaking scenes which you would admire for sure and movie is at his best. The thing that took me to is when they got back to the 1995, they have showed it exactly the same way which was showed in part one and those were absolutely best scenes i have ever encountered.

They return to the present time only to see that its a violent and mad world taken over by Biff, the bully in the first. Apparently while in the future, Marty bought a Sports Almanac, (a book showing the results of each sporting event in the 20th century) which Biff gets his hands on, turning him rich in the future. Marty and Doc go back to the year 1955 to redo the events in the first, and get the almanac from Biff, which he got from his future self.The story gets a little confusing, but its well explained, and also shows to prove things as well. Some of the events were quite unnecessary, and the scenes back in 1955 kind of borrow from the first a little. But it still stays strong with the irony, with clever jokes and humor.The doc remains his ordinarily crazy self, along with many other characters. Although there's no certain point in specific on where they stay on, it is definitely more adventurous and more agile.Like I said before, not as good, but a positive and worthy sequel.",

And though I saw the first one first I was really young (like 6 or 7) and didn't appreciate it as much as I would've if I had been a bit older.\n\n    So, because of this...Back To The Future Part II is still my fave! To me, it is the most creative and suspenseful of the three...one of the most exciting being when Marty is hanging from a rope above a stage while trying to stop Biff's friends from slugging 'the other Marty' while 'the other Marty' is playing \"Johnny Be Good\"! Magic! I loved how (although those people always stuck on factual movie errors would have a field day with this one) the film seemed to try *so* hard to reenact every part of the first movie correctly.  Even the fact that you can tell that some parts are actually from the first and *not* reenacted is cute. Like right after, \"Hey,you,get your damn hands off her...\" when Biff gets punched...His haircut is slightly different than from the rest of the movie.\n    What I liked most about the plot is that it twisted more than a Twizzler! I love when movies do this! It keeps you at the edge of your toes... People who say it is too confusing...it is probably for some, but after having seen it over 100 billion times, it is real easy to follow! =) No, really. I mean, I know there will always be goofs regarded as plot holes for this film, as for any time travel movie. But, until such a phenomenon can be invented, there will always be arguments like...\" Well, uh, if Biff changed everything in the past, how come he was still alive in the future?\", or what not.       It's still important to use as much logic and intelligence as possible when making a film like this.As far as thinking it through on these terms, I like how this one was still a lot more accurate than the first Back To The Future, where Marty holding up a photograph of his siblings disappearing head-first would never happen. Since each action could make a difference and create its own alternate reality, as Doc described, a person's existence (or hand!) cannot be semi-visible or almost non-existent, since it either \"is\" or \"isn't\" there.    I just want to add that I love the character (and the actor who plays him) of Biff!!!  I don't think any of the other flicks he plays in for the rest of his life will come close to the charisma \"Biff\" has! Michael J.Fox, is of course, inexpendable in his role, and all the rest of the cast is great. '   I love that Flea (from Red Hot CP)is in this movie, he's \"Needles\".   There's only one really annoying part: at the beginning, the really pretty lady who played Jennifer in the first was replaced by Liz Shue, who says (probably the worst line of her career, definitely the worst line of the movie) \"Marty, what do you mean, the future? How can we be in the future?!\"\nIn conclusion, this film is the most exciting and suspenseful (clock tower scene and all) film of the trilogy.....(Part III was a little too mellow and plain.) PLEASE  SEE PART II!!!! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!FOOTNOTE: If you're like me, who *loves* movies that deal with the suggestion of time travel to revolve around the plot, without a B-grade 'metallic' costume and set design quality, with great acting, PLEASE GO TO THE VIDEO STORE RIGHT NOW, AND WATCH 12 MONKEYS, if you haven't already seen. This is my favourite time travel movie. You will be surprised at how much of a range Bruce Willis has, and of course, the delightful absurdity of Brad Pitt's character. \nNow, \"Make like a tree, and get out of here!\"-Sep",

A lot of the charm that the original had more of is made up for by the fact that the movie goes back to the events of the first film. This makes us see the film we watched in 1985 in different points of view. The future world they create is also very interesting, and had very strong visuals for the time. One of my favorite scenes is when Marty goes into Cafe 80's, and elements of the 80's like Nintendo, Micheal Jackson, and Ronald Regan are everywhere.

I really liked that this story was depending on the story of Back to the Future (1985) and opposite, which was a joy to see. The production did a really good job here! Even that 1985's vision of the future 2015 wasn't one hundred percent precise, I had a fun time watching these \"new\" things that were almost a shock for Marty's and Dr. Emmet Brown's eyes. I think it was a good choice to make Biff Tannen the villain here, especially when time is involved. I have to admit that I felt a little sorry for Tannen at the end. He obviously had a difficult childhood, and he is the typical bully who has been bullied before, or at least had struggles at home. About an other thing, I wasn't very satisfied with the trailer of Back to the Future Part III (1990) at the end of this movie. It kind of spoiled the whole concept.

This one doesn't seem to get the play on TV like 1 and 3 do, but I think that is because it plays out like a true 2nd act should with the end leaving you hanging. When it is on TV, as with the others, I stop and watch and enjoy it.",

            "content": "Back to the Future II is a solid sequel to the first one which Back to the Future (1985) is a masterpiece. This a fun travel science fiction comedy in the trilogy. It deals with paradox past traveling. From traveling with DeLoren in to the future and back to the past again. This film in my opinion it doesn't deserve the hate it gets, like mostly viewers stated. I love Back to the Future trilogy it is one of my favorite all-time favorite trilogies of all time. I grew up with this trilogy i have seen the first one on VHS when i was a kid. Years later i have seen the sequels on TV. I love this movie and it is my third favorite film in the trilogy. Don't get me wrong but I have enjoyed Back to the Future Part III more than Part II but I think the second film is the most underrated film in the trilogy and the most unappreciated.When Back to the Future was initially conceived, director and writer Robert Zemeckis and writer Bob Gale had no idea how much notoriety it would eventually achieve, nor of the big box office records it would break. They were happy just to see their project come to fruition. When they wrote the original film, the ending they had written was supposed to be the end of it. Because of it's success, however, and Hollywood being Hollywood, there had to be the inevitable sequels. The problem was that with the original ending, they had painted themselves into a corner as to where they could go with the sequel. What they finally came up with in Part II, is a film that is every bit as whimsical as the original, yet moves along at a pace that will leave you breathless.For Part II the cast is pretty much intact from the original film. The exceptions are Crispin Glover as George McFly has been replaced by Jeffery Weisman and Claudia Wells has been replaced by Elizabeth Shue as Marty's girlfriend Jennifer. George McFly's role in the sequel is more talked about by other characters than his actual on screen time, and Jennifer's time on Screen is quick and brief also (although she has one great scene that takes place in the future) so neither casting change is of any consequence.What makes the Back to the Future series so terrific, is that Zemeckis and Gale took the time travel concept, applied a little originality to it, then let their imagination run wild. In BTTFII, we get a story that moves along like a runaway freight train. Not content to give us what the year 2015 may be truly like, since making such predictions are usually wrong anyway, they decide to let it all hang loose and just have fun with it. They are holographic theaters, Cafe 80's shops, antique stores that sell dust-blowers and other things, skateboards that hover, paying for cab rides with thumbprints, etc. Etc. Yet, for all the glossy, multi-colored stores and goofy concepts, we still recognize it as the same old Hill Valley. Something else Zemeckis and Gale do is to take some events from the first film, and replay them in 2015 Hill Valley. Usually, things like this would be seen as the lack of an idea, but in this its simply Zemeckis having a little fun and letting us in on it. It works perfectly.As for the cast, Fox and Lloyd keep their characters of Marty and Doc on the same entertainer level as before. Fox is also given the chore of playing his nerdy son of the future, Marty as a middle aged man and even his daughter of the future. He is pretty much successful except I do think playing his daughter was a bit much. Lea Thompson, again has the difficult chore of bringing Lorraine to us in three different characterizations, and as before handles it admirably. Her 1955 Lorraine will always be her most memorable characterization in these films, but the others are equally well done. As for Thomas F. Wilson as Biff, Biff is biff, no matter how old, how young, or how powerful he may be, and his consistence of performance is also noteworthy.The fun fact is that on October 21, 2015, Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd reprise their roles as Marty McFly and Doc Brown on Jimmy Kimmel Live and it quite Hilarious to see on TV.I don't see this film as superior to its predecessor, but it's still a fun ride going back to different time periods and is definitely a must-watch for fans of the first film if they haven't seen the sequels.8/10.",

I liked the first one, I also liked this one. I actually like this one more. The special effects are amazing and it's filled with \"how did they do that? When the hell did this film come out? The 80's? God damn that's amazing.\" But for all its glorious sets and special effects there is few plot holes and lots of things which are just plain stupid. But to enjoy this film, you pretty much have to just shut off your brain. For the time it was great, and I'd imagine so many people were dazzled by the special effects that they didn't notice the stupidness that was all over it. Also, the acting could've been improved but aside from that. It's an enjoyable little film and you really just have to enjoy it for what it's worth. It's not amazing, but it was in the 80's.",

The constant adrenaline rush which was really cool, but I think the first one had a better ending, because here we are clearly told that we are going to have a threesome, while the first one ended and although the second one was good, I think it could have ended quite well. Here we are immediately excited for the threequel and so I didn't quite get a sense of an ending or any sort of climax, which was there but not like the previous film. Bottom line. Very hard to determine which episode was more successful. Both films were very good, but I choose the first one because of the already mentioned better ending.

            "content": "Bob Gale, Neil Canton, and Robert Zemeckis did not intend to make a sequel to Back to the Future. The first film ended with Doc, Marty, and Jennifer flying in the Delorean, intent on traveling to the year 2015. This was only meant to be a joke, so when Universal asked them to do a second movie, the writers were sort of in a bind. Robert Zemeckis was not interested in doing a movie about the future, and the writers had no idea what to do with Jennifer during all the action. Despite a possible lack of enthusiasm from Zemeckis and difficulties with the writing, Back to the Future II turned out to be a very fun, but somewhat darker sequel.In the year 2015, Marty and Doc prevent Marty McFly Jr. from agreeing to assist Griff Tannen (Biff's grandson) rob a store or a bank. During all the madness Marty buys a Sports Almanac, which contains a record of the outcome of every sporting event from 1950 to 2000. It should be the size of a telephone book but it's just the size of a graphic novel. An old Biff secretly steals the time machine and the almanac, gives it to himself in the year 1955, and seriously alters history. Doc and Marty return to a 1985 that has turned into a ghetto. Biff became a millionaire, murdered George McFly, and married Marty's mother. In order to set the time line straight, Marty and Doc have to return to the night of the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance from the first movie and destroy the Sports Almanac.The crew went crazy with the design of the future. Holograms, flying cars, and floating skate boards all make up the look of the year 2015. This was my favorite part of the movie when I was a kid because it was the most outlandish. Of course they got everything about the future wrong, but who really cares? Now I find myself liking the science-fiction aspect of the story. Returning to the first movie and seeing two Martys and two Docs on screen at once was a brilliant idea. I think the second act of the movie was so dark that it was seen as a departure from what made the first movie so good. The movie does lack the heartwarming feel of the first film, but they brought it back with full force in Part III. If I had one major criticism it would be that it takes too long to really get going. The first half of the film is just exposition for the third act in 1955, and the ending is just a set up for Part III, which makes it less satisfying than the first movie for many people.",

This is handled admirably: the situations that Marty and Doc get into are inventive, creative, original, daring, bold, exciting, and all the rest of it. But one serious, serious flaw permeates the entire film.Here is the problem: the film is far too serious. It's too dark, it's too menacing, it's too (dare I say it?) intimidating. The original Back to the Future was pure, unadulterated fun. Part II follows the trend of nearly every trilogy after the highly successful Star Wars series: the first film is fun, the second is extremely dark, the third will often return to the original's spirit. This worked for Star Wars, but not Back to the Future. Had it been any other film, this would've ended up so much better\u2014 Back to the Future should be a lot of fun to watch. Part II was more thoughtful and contemplative, and although the film was strong, it did not feel like the same series or the same director.The Verdict: A very strong, well-made, original, and well thought-out sequel, but without the spirit of fun that made the original such a blazing success.Overall Rating: 9/10",

But once this hit video and I had a chance to watch it a couple of more times, I realised what a truly impressive film it is.  Zemeckis and Gale are geniuses!  This zips along at a breathtaking pace and doesn't let up for second.  The effects are superb, it's very funny most of the time, but it isn't afraid to be very dark in places.  One thing I really like is that Zemeckis and Gale actually credit the audience with having some intelligence, whereas most fantasy films these days only require the IQ of a 5 year old to understand.HOWEVER one thing thats always bothered me about this is why does Marty meet his future self when they go to 2015?  In the first one Einstein disappears when he goes into the future and Doc and Marty live those seconds without him, so surely when Doc and Marty travel into the future the rest of the world should have gone on without them and they would have been reported missing in 1985?  Alternate time line you say, but when is it ever stated that by simply travelling through time you enter a different reality. Fair enough if you go back in time and alter the past and then go forward again things might have changed, but if you are travelling on a straight line forward you shouldnt be able to meet yourself.Aaahhh!

            "content": "Michael J. Fox returns as Marty McFly as we take off right from where the original left us. Very few sequels actually do this and usually allow for time to take place between the parts, but not in this series. I admit I do love it when sequels do this. It actually allows me the viewer to have his emotions already riding high if I loved the original (as I do in this case). Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) leaves for the future only to return moments later to Marty and his girlfriend (this time played by Elisabeth Shue) and telling them that they must return to the future for their kids' future is at stake. So Marty and Jennifer join the Doc and Einstein his dog to go to 2015. What takes place is a great story involving multiple time jumps, seeing the future and reliving the past as multiple Martys are back in 1955. I really did love that about this film.The big reason why I find it flawed though is the story. Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis (who also directed) penned the story and I give them props for injecting some true originality and great humour into the story, but through so much action and time jumps it leaves a hole in the story you could drive a DeLoren through. To some this may not matter, but to me it is huge. After Doc Brown explains to the audience about Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) stealing the DeLoren going back to 1955 and creating a new 1955 you should clue into the fact that when Biff leaves 1955 to go back to 2015 he would be going to an alternate 2015. Not the 2015 where he stole the DeLoren from Marty and Doc Brown, but a new 2015 where he would be mega rich and there would be now two Biff Tannen's. The 2015 Marty and Doc Brown are in has no Biff Tannen's and more importantly no DeLoren. Meaning Marty and Doc would be stuck in that alternate 2015 unless Doc could recreate the DeLoren, but then you would have to go back to 1955, then go back to the future to deal with a rogue DeLoren, then back to 1955 to deal with Biff and his disasterous plans. Sorry folks, my apologizes to everyone who did not want to read that, but I feel I had to go through that plot hole.In saying that though the film is I find extremely fun to watch and even though I find it has its flaws its still highly recommended from me. I remember going to the theatre to watch this for my 10th birthday with my parents and my friend Mike. Still has terrific music from Alan Silvestri. Also starring Charles Fleischer, a young Elijah Wood and Joe Flaherty in a great final scene. Followed by part III the next year to wrap up the great film series.",

If the sports almanac covers every game in every major sport for 50 years, why is it only the size of your average magazine? It would have to be an encyclopedia! I know it's a bit much to ask for realism in a movie like this, but would it have been so hard for the film makers to make this a little bit believable?2. Where is Crispin Glover?

But if you're an avid BTTF buff and an attentive viewer, you will greatly enjoy the twists and turns Michael J. Fox's Marty encounters in this creative film.  We are treated to three different time periods, plus scenes that overlap from the first film.  (Hint: If you are attempting to watch Part Two before seeing Part One, give up.)The actors here are competent and entertaining, with the exception of Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer, who acts pretty dense.  No worry, she's not important or central in the film; she only provides the set-up for the future time travel.We see the characters in different stages of life, which is amazingly realistic through expert make-up.  Fox plays himself, himself as an older man, his son, AND his daughter.  What a family.  The paradoxed start piling up at this point, but if you can try not to become too confused and stick around for the fun, it's a great thrill ride.  Biff and Marty duke it out in a surrealistic future, which is caused by Marty's own greedy negligence.My favorite part of the film are the scenes intercut with the first movie. It's interesting to watch Marty go back in time to fix his current problem while managing to not screw up his FIRST encounter, which we witnessed in Part One.  Follow???  It's a slick sense of deja vu.This movie is darker in tone than its predecessor, mostly due to Marty's efforts to thrawt the Evil Biff.  I enjoy it more with every viewing. It's the same with all the BTTF films--you simply catch more of the time-dependent details with multiple viewings.  Plus there's obvious repetition within the trilogy, and that lends to a sort of cohesiveness between the three.",

But since it has already past 2015 and I am still waiting to see anything close to a flying car, let alone a hover-board item that actually hovers above the ground, instead of something that runs more like a stupid Power Wheels product, the situation does make you question if that will even have a chance to happen.The 2015 part was rather ironic when they saw Arnold Schwarzenegger having been President, when they weren't that far-off after his roll as the Governor of California. Today, it almost makes you wonder if this movie had a part in Schwarzenegger's original inspiration for running to be California's governor.This movie does get a little slow in a few scenes; most of which were the beginning scenes in his trip back to Biff's modified 1985, parts in Marty's correcting trip back into 1955 were somewhat slow too, but (as Marty explains while knocking out Biff) \"Back to the Future II\" is still a \"fun\" movie to watch. Another moment that was rather interesting and amusing, the ending scene that was simply a picture that pointed directly to the trilogy's incoming ending: \"To be concluded.\"",

            "content": "It had been five years since the release of Back To The Future. In the summer of 1988, it was still very much part of the 80s way of movies. Universal came to Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale wanting to do two more films.The original draft of the second film would be sending Marty Mcfly and the Delorean time machine back to the 60s. However, reviewing the work, Zemeckis realized it would not work.It became apparent to the writers that making a sequel to Back To The Future would take some serious time and effort. As soon as Who Framed Roger Rabbit? was complete and in theaters, Zemeckis and Gale began writing.Deciding to go into the future, the two writers decided to make the future a happy place because they felt that the future was way too often mispredicted. Not only this, but they spend time consulting with Rick Carter, the production designer on what the 'future' should look like.The rest of the film is a bit of an overlap. Marty Mcfly goes back to 1955 to prevent Biff Tannen from monopolizing Hill Valley. Every little detail was exactly the same, right down to the positioning of the actors.What makes Back To The Future Part II so unique is that you get to see parts of the first film from the prospective of another character. This had not been done in Hollywood before in a sequel.The other major part of the film is the vista glide that was used to create the dinner sequence in 2015 with Michael J. Fox ending up in three places at once for the final take. Other similar shots were simply done by cutting the film in half for scenes with two Biffs and two Doc Brown's.Back To The Future Part II takes the storyline to the next level in time travel giving the audience the chance to see what happens when there's a ripple effect in a time line.A number of the techniques used in the film give film-makers today the technology they need to create bigger and better special effects. Thus, the sequel made history.",

What happened to the clever, thinks fast on his feet Marty Mcfly?  Biff was a bully for sure in the 1950\"s. He becomes ugly and too over the top evil in part 2.  Doc Brown is the only main character who stays pretty much the same. Sure, change is refreshing and needed, but the script takes the characters too far. Part 1 has many classic scenes that become iconic. The clever writing is history in part 2. It was also confusing at times to follow the back and forth time travel. Marty and Doc go back to 1955 again, but they have to be careful not to meet Marty and Doc from 1985, who went back to 1955 originally. Also, old Biff goes back to 1955 to talk to young Biff. Marty and Doc have to be careful not to be spotted by young Biff, or old Biff, and old Biff must return to the 21st Century before he is \"caught\" by Marty and Doc- who are in the future to see old Marty and Doc. WHEW!! Just a little bit too twisted and too busy. They gave it a nice try, but one classic is all this trilogy had in it. \"Back To The Future\" , part 1 was ahead of its' time.

Actually this is a review for the entire Trilogy, but I decided to put it under Part II for two reasons.1) Most people HATE this movie, so it'll be nice to actually read a nice review here.2) I wanted to be the 100th reviewer.Back To The Future (BTTF) is one of my favorite movies of all-time.  I admit, it may have to do with the fact that I grew up in the 80's and this movie epidomizes the 80's: skateboards, Deloreans, Michael J. Fox, the casual use of '1985', etc.  It may have to do with the fact that I thought 'George McFly' was one of the greatest characters in history.  Maybe it's just that I had a crush on Lea Thompson.  For these reasons and more, I loved the entire BTTF Trilogy.I won't go into the details of each movie, but I'll tell you why I like Part II.Yes, Part II was a little choppy, but I think it needed to be told the way it was told.  ***MINOR SPOILERS*** There had to be proof, as they talked about in the original, that whatever you do in the past could mess up the outcome of future events.  So the whole going back to 1955 was an integral part of the trilogy, because, really that is where all the time travel stemmed to in the beginning.  I don't know if that makes sense, but just trust me on this one. ***END OF SPOILERS***Besides Michel J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, the rest of the cast (Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson, etc.) were all great.  I try to watch this entire trilogy at least once every six months, and I just enjoy all three movies thoroughly.I admit, I enjoy the original and Part III more than I enjoy Part II, but I can't say I hate Part II, like a lot of people (including my wife).Now that it's on DVD, there should be no reason for you to buy this movie.P.S. While you're watching Part II, watch closely in the part where Marty goes into the 80's cafe and plays the video game.  One of the kids is Elijah 'Frodo' Wood.",

            "content": "Downvote me if you must, but you know the truth. It's better than the first. This sequel was everything a person could ask for in a family-rated movie about time travel. The character flaws actually gave the characters more depth. Marty's reckless attitude got him into a car accident that cost him his career in music in 1985, then it got his future self fired in 2015. He bought the sports almanac in 2015 to take back to 1985 for financial gain, which eventually caused Biff to presumably murder his father, marry his mother, and basically become an unstoppable millionaire casino boss in an alternate 1985. This reminded everyone how young and naive Marty is, despite coming off as mature and cool-mannered. Doc had always been the guiding voice of genius, but he still doesn't fix his time machine when it starts to glitch, and that causes him to be sent back to 1885. This type of character development added an element of realism that is usually completely forgotten in family films. Number two, the special effects and props. And not just computer generated effects. This movie had so many beautiful sets from three (technically four) distinct versions of Hill Valley. The original 1985, hyper-futuristic 2015, alternate distopic 1985, and the classic 1955. Needless to say, they displayed each time period flawlessly and we're left with a seamless story that has enough beautiful 80s flare and eye-popping effects to make this movie truly timeless. Which leads to number three, the plot (specifically how time is represented). This movie went above and beyond what was expected of a sequel to the first film. Fans were left with the cliffhanger of the flying DeLorean entering the year 2015 to save Marty and Jennifer's kids, and that was all they had in mind. More adventures except this time the budget has allowed them to take place in the future. But this movie added in so much more about the \"disastrous consequences\" that Doc always rants about, and those are what time travel fanatics want to see in a movie about time travel. There was much more at stake here than just Marty and his family. This was a story about how one mistake in the future led to many lives ruined in the present, and how the person who made that mistake eventually made things right. That's the kind of hero an audience can root for without feeling like they're rooting for someone fictional. Number four, originality. I don't know when it started, but at some point the directors and writers of the sequels to box office hits began to piggyback off the jokes and plot of the originals. This is lazy and disrespectful towards fans, though they might play it off as a tribute to the classic. But this movie decided to make a new path and they totally stuck the landing.",

I honestly found it disappointing when compared to the first one. This is still a pretty good movie, but I didn't find it anywhere near as good as the original. First off, this one isn't nearly as funny. The handful of jokes that were thrown in there kind of fell flat for me. I also found it to be not as entertaining for the first two acts. The plot isn't as engaging as the first one for me, I felt that it didn't have the same charm as the first one. Christopher Lloyd and Micheal J. Fox still give great performances and their dynamic is still the best part of the movie for me. I don't think the plot starts to pick up until the third act where Marty and Doc go back to the events of the original movie. Overall, I thought the movie was pretty good but not on the same level as the first. 7/10.",

It is fun, clever, and everything a summer blockbuster needs to be to succeed. There was a little more discussion about the effects of time travel in part 2, and we got to witness the flawed character of Marty McFly, as he stops whatever he is doing, no matter how important, and puts up his dukes at the mere threat of being a chicken. Sophomoric, but it fits perfectly into this world created by Spielberg, Zemeckis, and Gale, and for me was a constant reminder that this was a family film that was meant just to entertain. Highlights include a hover board in both the future and the past(which, by the way we are re only 5 years away from that needing to be a reality), the phrase 'Great Scott', which I am pretty sure Christopher Lloyd negotiated a bonus into his contract every time he squeezed one in, and the introduction of everyone in Americas new dream (to go into the future and find a sports almanac that can be used to bet with and make millions!).

            "content": "\"Dr. Emmett 'Doc' Brown\" (Christopher Lloyd) arrives from the future seconds after coming back from the past to find \"Marty McFly\" (Michael J. Fox) and his girlfriend \"Jennifer Parker\" (Elisabeth Shue, who has taken over the role from Claudia Wells starting in this movie). \"Brown\" informs them that there is a problem with their children in the future, and insists that they come with him.In the future, after \"Doc\" renders \"Jennifer\" unconscience when she begins to ask way too many questions in the excitement of being in the future, \"Doc\" and \"Marty\" find \"Marty Jr.\" (Fox), who is a complete nerd, being harassed by \"Griff Tannen\" (Thomas F. Wilson), the future grandson of \"Biff Tannen\" (Wilson), who is the high school arch-rival of \"Marty's\" father, \"George\" (Jeffrey Weissman and, in footage from the original movie to show the original actor's face, Crispin Glover). After \"Marty\" helps his nerdy, but look-alike son, with \"Griff\" and his gang, he comes across an antiques store and purchases a magazine that lists sports results from 1950 to 2000.Eventually, the future version of \"Biff\" gets his hand on the magazine and steals the magazine, and steals the DeLorean time machine to go back to visit his younger self in 1955.Now, \"Doc\" and \"Marty\" have to go back to 1955 again, get the magazine and avoid their other selves that are already there (from the first movie).This is one of the most original sequels ever made, as it perfectly inserts many scenes from the original -- many of which were re-shot at different angles. It is also one of the few where multiple actors are playing more than one character, even if the character is the same person. You get to see many versions of the same person in other words.The performances are pretty fun, especially when the movie is in the scenes set in the future. Not only are we introduced to new characters, we see the same actors playing these comical characters -- especially Fox, who plays two characters in the future -- \"Marty Jr.\" and his sister, \"Marlene\" (who gets very little screen time compared to \"Marty Jr.). It must have been difficult for the cast to create variations of the character they originated in the first movie.The special effects in this film are not very original, but still hold up for the most part. While watching, I only saw a few instances where the special effects have weaken over the years, and it was obvious that they were inserted during post-production.I was pretty disappointed in the future \"Hill Valley\" for the most part. None of the vehicles looked authentic to me, and the clothing was fairly laughable with the choice of colors and design. There was some originality in the future -- the \"Jaws 19\" marquee, the self-tying sneakers (with light-up Nike logos) and the famed \"Mattel Hoverboard.\" The comedy is only worth some chuckles through out the entire movie. Some jokes are just rehash from the previous film, and are not set up well to the point that you don't expect it. However, at least one scene in the future is a nice rework of one of the more memorable scenes of the first movie.Make-up effects are not up to par in this movie. You get simple make-up effects to only fairly elaborate make-up effects. The \"aged\" effects are not good in my opinion. It is obvious that the future version of \"Biff\". as well as the future version of \"Jennifer's\" cleavage, are prosthetics (especially the cleavage, which looks more like rubber more than it does skin). Some performers even looked as if they had obvious hair dye jobs, instead of wigs.A lot of the music came from the original movie, with some new songs add in. I think only one song was used really well to set the tone of the scene, the rest were just there if you ask me.One thing that worked well, although it was a bit odd, was the scenes from the original movie re-shot from the point of view of \"Marty\" and \"Doc.\" If you notice, \"Marty's\" father, \"George\" is seen not looking at the camera, or his face is blurry due to being in the background of the scene where the principle characters are being shot. You are seeing a different actor in the role since Crispin Glover did not sign on to be in this movie, but you hear his voice from clips taken from the first movie.This film can get a bit confusing at times, due to the time paradox that \"Doc\" explains to \"Marty.\" Sometimes, you forget which version of the characters you are watching -- especially when another version is in the scene.This is a good movie for the entire family. The language, and violence is pretty mild, and the comedy is never crude or adult-oriented. The only thing I would suggest is that you watch the movies back-to-back.",

However, while they're they're, an event occurs that creates an alternate 1985 where Hill Valley is a hell-on-earth. Now, Doc and Marty must venture back to 1955 again to stop this alternate present from ever existing. However, they mustn't interfere with Marty's previous trip. This movie is non-stop suspense from start to finish. Once it starts, it never lets up and you're constantly on the edge of your seat. However, this sequel doesn't measure up to the first film. Part II has some casting changes that really irritate me, but they're acceptable. The roles in question are small parts anyway, but I still think that Claudia Wells is a way better Jennifer than Elizabeth Shue. The replacement for Crispin Glover is more acceptable, though, because the scenes he's in are so small that if you blink, you'll miss him. Despite it's flaws, Back to the Future Part II is an energetic film that's does what it's supposed to do: entertain.",

After a while all the coming and going through time became quite convoluted. The \"too be concluded...\" ending to Part II was also disappointing.

Now Old Biff gets back then Marty and Doc get in the delorean without knowing that Biff was in it. Then they go Back to 1985. Now 1985 is a whole lot different. Now they have to go back in time to 1955 to steal the almanac from young Biff so they can safe the future and go back to the way it was. It is not as good as BTTF 1 but that does not mean it is bad. I can see why it has Part II in the title. It is not as good or as fun as Back 1 but it is still good fun. It does have some flaws but I think this film is fun. It has 2 story lines.

Umm how do you work that out?? Logically Marti and Jennifer have kids in 30 years time because before they go with Doc they have lived their life in the normal fashion. Yes Doc taking them to the future takes them away from 1985 and affects the timeline, but that doesn't really matter, all it means is that they don't end up how they were going to (ie a mess). But just cos Doc takes them away doesn't mean they don't exist for 30 years because eventually they do finally get back to 1985 and thus only didn't exist for short period of time (if at all - I can't remember if they come back before they leave or a short time after).

It sure doesn't have the novelty or freshness of the original and certain aspects of the movie, like the casting of Michael J Fox to play all of his children, messy aging make-up on all the actors, shameless product placement, don't help its case. But, on the other hand, save a few unfortunate casting choices due to the unavailability of some (Claudia Wells couldn't return due to family issues), and utter refusal of others (Crispin Glover refused to come back on the grounds of not getting paid enough), the movie manages to maintain a nice sense of continuity, despite having being shot four years after the original, and a solid script by Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis, once again provides the solid foundation needed for getting the most out of its story and actors. Beautifully shot and photographed once again by Dean Cundey and with an amazing score by a returning Alan Silvestri, the movie is a joy to watch from beginning to end. It's a thrilling ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time and it's got one of the best twists ever seen on a movie. The choice of having to go back to 1955 on the exact same date the facts of the first movie take place in order to fix the Future, is a brilliant one, and gives the crew and cast a chance to revisit the first movie from a different point of view. It's easily the highlight of the movie and its final outcome provides it with one more twist for the upcoming sequel. Despite critics and hardcore fans of the original, this is one of the best sequels ever made and a solid turn from Gale, Zemeckis and all those involved to give us a follow-up that was never in their minds to begin with.

It is shown not as depressive, as we say in Blade Runner or A Clockwork Orange, but as positive and cheerful.These 20 minutes of Marty McFly's future adventure (not counting the scenes at Jennifer's house) is just one mind-blowing movie moment. Seriously, everything looks so great, I would give anything to be in such a future, walk along this Hill Valley, go to the 80's Cafe, have a glass of P-Perfect and fly around the city in a car time.The general mood of the \"bad\" 1985 is filmed very well, the city resembles one of the largest and most criminal districts in the United States. The ending is no less interesting, the connection with the first series, it becomes possible to look, so to speak, into the cut scenes of the first film and look at the story from a different angle. The final scene is also unique, Thomas F. Wilson plays wonderfully. Beff is probably the best school bull ever shown in the movie.\"Back to the Future\" trilogy (and especially the first 2 series) is like one big and most important film of my childhood. I remember for the first time I watched the first and second parts, probably somewhere in 1991, while still in kindergarten. These 2 films shocked me so much that even today, after many years, I can watch them endlessly, and they don't bother me. One thing is clear, unfortunately, no one will shoot anything like this. All new sci-fi blockbusters look nothing compared to the Back to the Future trilogy.10 out of 10.",

There is no way in 1989 the producers could ever imagine in the future there would be a device that looked exactly like this and it would be a phone! It's really eerie when you think about it. This is a movie about the future and it is 2015, and he is holding a device exactly like we use today in 2015. At 7:53 in the movie he holds it up and we see some hot chicks (that will always be a constant) and he might as well be holding my LG Smart Phone...it looks exactly like it. Weird right? If they only knew what they stumbled upon. There is some prop dude that was brilliant. Who knew...maybe an engineer was a fan of these movies and copied the design? Likely! Some dude had to come up with a prop and he might have been the inspiration of a phone revolution. That's history.",

In all do respect, I was highly disappointed after seeing it when it was first released and I just watched it again to give it another chance and it just frustrated & disappointed me even more. It isn't until the last third of the movie that allows you to get interested in it a bit again.Unfortunately they used too many of the same lines and just put different costumes on the actors. Skateboard scene, save the clock tower fund raiser, waking up in Lorrain's room again, Giff in the soda shop. Seriously?... you have the future at hand here and you rehash the past lines and scenes like the movie Groundhog Day. HUGE disappointment.In my opinion This film is lacking the genuiness, heart and soul of the first movie where you cared about the characters. How they handled Jennifer's part with a different actress was awful. The lack of Crispin Glover was one thing but how they even tried to voice him in was worse than leaving his part out all together. Even the voices of some of the key actors playing their original parts didn't sound right. Marty's stupid \"in disguise\" outfit and playing his multiple children just hurt.Time away from this movie has not helped me to see it with new eyes again. While I didn't expect the same magic that the first movie had, I had hoped it could've gotten much closer than this. The only reason I suggest watching it is to say you have and have that bridge between the first and last movie if you plan to watch that. You only need to own the first one. The third is at least tolerable but still not the magic of the first. I know some people enjoyed 2 based on some reviews but I honestly don't understand how.",

He returns to 1985 to tell Marty and Jennifer about it - so why do they need to go to the future to prevent it ? . This is where Part 2 jumps the proverbial shark more than the other 2 movies. Lets jump to Part 3 -the fax that Jennifer is holding at the end of Part 3 which was a fax of 2015 Marty getting fired in Part 2 magically erases- . Doc explains that their future isn't written yet hence the paper erased , of course the paper should have disappeared too in my opinion just like the tombstone disappearing in Part 3,.So with that scene of the paper being erased, it would mean that 1985 Martys timeline hasnt been written in the future. So in retrospect , why would you need to go into the future when you are in your past and could easily prevent it from happening since you already know its going to happen in the future,That's the whole problem here , you obviously have alternate timelines . When Marty and Jennifer of 1985 travel to the future of 2015 , how could they exist if they\ndisappeared from 1985 , there would have to be an alternate timeline where they didnt go into the future and stayed in 1985 and got married and such until 2015 when 1985 Marty and Jennifer from their timeline arrive, so it makes no sense for them to go into the future since it wont be their future anyway but an alternate trimelines future.. Totally incoherent plot - the future doesnt exist yet at the end of Part 3 so that writes off part 2 . Sheesh.",

Technically, it did end with a cliffhanger, but it was a joke cliffhanger\u0097one final gag in a series of romps. No viewer had any particular reason to expect the story to continue. But there was too much money at stake, and so not one but two sequels were produced. And that mock cliffhanger became a real springboard to further adventures. In a strange way, the plot device of Part II\u0097wherein the craven Biff Tannen steals Marty McFly's idea of using info from the future to make a monetary killing\u0097parallels the filmmakers' visit back in time to mine more money from their original box office goldmine. As faithful readers (and other intelligent people) know, sequels are meant to retell the original story while giving the illusion of advancing the original story. This sequel did something quite clever in literally revisiting the original movie and watching the action from a different perspective. (The mixing of old footage and new action presaged what director Robert Zemeckis would later do, more elaborately, in Forrest Gump.) It also paid homage to one of the most homage-paid movies of history, It's a Wonderful Life, by having our hero Marty McFly witness the dire fate of his home town in an alternate reality. The film is rife with in jokes, like when Michael J. Fox is startled by a holographic ad for Jaws 19. Tweaking the films' producer, Steven Spielberg, he mutters, \"Shark still looks fake.\" And, just as the first film ends with a mock cliffhanger, this one ends with a real one. As with the second Star Wars movie, audiences were put on notice that they would have to wait for another movie to be released to find out what happens next.",

I wouldn't mind taking my kids to it if it weren't for the mild language and the little bits of sexual innuendo.However, I have to say that \"Back to the Future II\" /doesn't/ work for me. OK, it's entertaining, to a certain extent. But what killed it for me was its logistical errors. Sure, Dr. Brown (played wonderfully by Christopher Lloyd) and Marty (the star of the movie, Michael J. Fox) go ahead into time to \"the amazing year\" 2015. And they stop Marty, Jr., Marty's son, from being a part of a crime that was the idea of Griff, Biff's grandson (both played by Thomas J. Wilson). By the way, I would have thought that Biff wouldn't have any grandchildren, let along children in this being that George, Marty's dad, stood up to him. The rest, I'm not even going to go there.But, then, Biff gets wind of the whole situation with the time machine, not to mention that Marty wants to profit from it by buying a sports almanac for the years 1950-2000. He steals the DeLorean behind Doc and Marty's backs to give the book to young Biff. And it's obvious to me that not only would George McFly get killed by Biff and that Doc Brown would be committed to a mental institution, but also that old Biff would probably get stuck in 1955 because the DeLorean would have disappeared something like everything else that changed with Marty's meddling.But, I don't know.

If we want to gape at special effects or gadgets there are an abundance of sci-films. I didn't quite see the point of having George McFly being held upside down as some attempt to show we've advanced medically to allow that. Why I ask would any human want to see the world upside down besides the fact that being held upside for long periods can be damaging, OK maybe I'm nit-picking here but you get my drift.Yes BTTF2 its still watchable and has some funny scenes, but overall it is a darker confusing sequel that could have been so much better.",

I'll give an 10/10 for all three pictures... \"Plot holes: In the future, old Biff steals the time machine to travel back to 1955 and give his younger self the almanac. When he returns to the future (and crashes into the trash cans) it is the same future as he had left even though it should have been an alternate future in which he was rich\". But in my opinion, the old Biff on his way back to the normal future, should disappear at all, because changing future of young Biff he is changing his own life (and the future environment) the old Biff is not part of it anymore. And he's personal experiences have never happened, so his development stops at the same moment when the young Biff even touched the magazine. The new future belongs now to the young Biff who got the Sport magazine. So the DeLorean should stay in 1955 or flew (if he disappear on it's way) empty to the bad future. Plot hole: If you take all three pictures and put them together that you'll realize that we see maybe 2 week's of the life of Marty McFly. In the beginning he is an shy virgin, which is waiting for his first shot, in all period (of three movies) he has no chance to start his sexual experience. But in the film his character changing very quick in an experienced macho. It is impossible for any person to change in a week or two so fast. Even if the life events are going very fast, the mind of the person needs time to put it all together. My point is that this movie was made 1985, 1989 and 1990. Time gap of 5 years, during making the movie M.J. Fox grew up and changed the personage into a brave macho guy. So the story period is to short to make such change, M.J.Fox needed 5 years and Marty McFly only a 2 week's. Same impossible change you can see in The Lords of The Rings. Periode of the story is only a week top. But in the beginning Frodo is afraid to even touch the sword and the following movies he's cutting demos like butter. Can't be wright, you can't make a man in couple of hours from a fuz... But please find out for your self and make your own judgment",

Intro to the future, Conflict being Biff and the adventure it took to stop him, and Resolution - stopping Biff, and burning the almanac. The difference with this film, is that after it ended - it started again with Doc getting zapped away, knowing there would be a third installment... Like the show Quantam Leap - It always ended with the beginning of next week's show. That is what this movie did.. We're just not used to seeing movies do this, so many people don't \"get it\". Personally, I think its great :-)As for humor- This sequel may not have been \"funnier\", but it's obvious it wasn't supposed to be. It told a story, and if you sit back and forget about the fact that none of this could ever happen - It's fun throwing logic out the window for a few hours, and pretending it all could. I thought it was well done for a fantasy story, and had a lot of \"meat.\" it was constantly moving, where the first one flowed nicely but had no reason to be as complex.. This movie was a lot quicker, and I guess that confused some people? ah well... it worked for me. If you love the concept and story of the first, this one is a treat.",

            "content": "The original Back to the Future is my favorite movie of all time, so following it up was never going to be an easy task, and it'd be perfectly logical to assume it shouldn't even be attempted. That said, I'm so glad the sequels exists! This movie is so creative! It can't quite top the original, but for me personally, it gets dang close to matching it. The first act of this movie is the one most people recall, and it's what it's most known for, but ironically, it's my least favorite portion of the film. While the first half hour or so is perfectly entertaining, enjoyable, and even necessary for setting up the rest of the plot, it's after that when I feel this movie truly hits the gas! The formula gets changed up quite a bit this time around, and even when things get pretty familiar, there are new spins on them. The only thing holding this back from a perfect 10 for me is that first half hour. Some of the writing is a little clunky in the beginning and could've used a few more revisions. It's clear they wrote themselves into a corner on some small things that they had to work around. Other than that though, the writing and plot drastically improves at the beginning of the second act, and doesn't stop until the end...and what an end. If you've never seen these movies, and you're marathoning them for the first time, you will not be able to resist finishing out the trilogy. I love revisiting the experience that is Back to the Future, and part 2 is a very solid sequel, and one of my favorite sequels ever made. It's got heart pounding tension that isn't afraid to get dark at times, but is followed by great laughs to balance it out. If you haven't seen this movie or this trilogy for that matter, do yourself a favor, drop what you're doing, and binge them however you can!",

            "content": "not originally designed to have a sequel despite having an end that cried out for one, Back to the Future was a good film. Full of heart, well scripted and the actors clearly putting all their heart in there. It appealed to a wide audience but despite having time travel. The Sci-Fi fans were left out, though they could enjoy Chris Loyd's character. I am not a sci-fi fan although i admittedly enjoy star wars but have never liked anything else in this genre. Unless you count the back to the future trilogy. I saw parts of Back to the future 2 before any of the others and as i flicked through I instantly regretted not watching the whole thing. As the first one I saw and one with parts that i remembered seeing, enjoying but not getting as I hadn't seen the original, I am particularly fond of this film out of the three. I try to avoid ruining it for myself by not watching it that much, so it is still a treat when I watch it. Back to the future was a good film but it took several watchings for me to warm up to it and soon I loved it. However it never over took this one, the plot is full of action, adventure, laughs, brilliant characters and new twists. It does not make the mistake many sequels make of being exactly the same thing just repeated but also doesn't make the mistake of falling into the trap of being so completely different fans of the first one will be disappointed. The story is original and we never settle in one period of time. The story really gives, the Biff/Griff character a chance to shine as a real villain not just as the high school bully he was in the first film and we also got to see the first film from a different angle and find out what happened in between scenes and behind the scenes in the background. We finally get to see the future and instead of trying to predict the future they took the mickey out of the future. The entire cast shine and they make the best out of what they have. This time leaving the film intentionally open for Back To The Future 3, and with this ending it is a film you can't wait to see.",

In fact, the second one stretches one's mind a bit to really understand from a scientific view, sort of, what it's all about. I can see people like me who really like sci-fi time travel movies enjoying this movie. Although, I can see a down to earth realist also enjoying this just as much.This movie can also be classified as a love story within a love story, an adventure through time, and a suspenseful one at that. There's mystery and intrigue along with many other facets that are just amazing. If this movie were remade today, I can only imagine how mind boggling it would be with all the new movie tricks we can do now.Don't be left in the past.

            "content": "For my money the final scene in Back To The Future is perfection. Intended as a joke, a riposte to the neat, happy endings we are usually offered, it completely blew me away (a similar, though less effective, ending occurs in Joe Dante's 'Inner Space'). In 1989 virtually the same scene opened Back To The Future Part II. I was worried. As an ending the sudden shift in tone, the zaniness, works. It is unexpected and yet welcomed. As an opening scene it is a disaster. We end up with a follow up to a joke ending. Suddenly Doc Brown is shouting all the time, racing around and looking maniacal. He behaves not how he did throughout the first film but how he did for the first film's ending. Jennifer goes from being a cool customer ('How 'bout a ride Mister?') to the most annoying and offensively realized female character in a film since Willie Scott ('I wonder where we live, I bet it's a big house with lots of kids...'). Why does she have to spend most of the film asleep? Surely she could have been involved in the adventures? Her role could have been similar to Marty's in the first film. Humour could have been derived from her unwillingness to treat it all as another day at the office as Marty and Doc are now able to. Instead, to the film's detriment, she is treated like a prop and written as an idiot ('You should be able to convince her that it was all a dream'). Marty, who had already completed his character arc, suddenly has anger issues and an unsettling desire to be rich. It all feels very forced because that's exactly what it is. Biff Tannen was ideal in the first film as a supporting character. Now the entire plot rests on his shoulders. Watching the moment in the opening scene where he comes out to see the Delorean taking flight and disappearing, the sudden transformation he goes through from subservient lackey to sinister bad guy, makes you realize just how desperate the whole endeavour is. Lorraine McFly has to be one of the least independent female characters ever committed to celluloid. Apparently her appearance and personality is controlled by which type of man she is with ('You were the one who wanted me to get these things...'). On her wedding day we see that she is extremely uncomfortable with Biff which begs the question as to why is she going through with it. Is she so weak that she needs a man in order to know how to live her life? George is a wimp so she's an alcoholic, then George is a successful writer so she's healthy and happy, then Biff is evil and rich so she's a mess. What does this say about the filmmaker's view of women? A lot of the problems came from the decision to not pay Crispin Glover what he was asking to reprise his role as George McFly. I would love to know how much he wanted since the film loses much through his absence. Bob Gale looks extremely pleased with himself in the making of the Back To The Future trilogy documentary when he talks about his power as a screenwriter and how he was able to simply kill George McFly's character off, as if he'd done it in such a creative and subtle way that we'd hardly noticed. It's funny then that the whole thing seems so contrived and obvious and that it was necessary to use footage from the first film of Glover (without asking his permission) to fill in the gaps. Expertly done Bob. So confident is he of his writing prowess he fails to notice the one glaring error in his masterpiece. Doc is more than happy to tell Marty about problems his offspring will have thirty years from now but unwilling to tell him about a car accident he'll have the following day that will ruin his entire life, apparently to teach him a lesson. What a pal. It is all of these inconsistencies and miscalculations that make the second film such a disappointment. There are countless other problems, such as the terrible editing, the obvious, set-bound, artificiality of Biff's penthouse and the road by the Lyon's Estate billboard, Michael J. Fox and Thomas Wilson, both fine actors but neither of them exactly Alec Guiness, being forced to pull off multiple roles (And Fox's portrayal of a female corresponds with the depiction of female characters in the film), and the fact that Marty McFly is apparently some kind of silent, invisible entity throughout the last third of the film that only the audience can see and hear, but these things could have been forgiven if more thought had gone into the characters and the story.In the DVD documentary Robert Zemeckis states that the sequels were going to be made whether he was involved or not. The fact that he decided to be involved shows that he didn't want someone else to make them. He needn't have worried. Back To The Future Part II feels like it was made by completely different people anyway. There is a smug laziness to the film, as if everyone knew the film was going to make money so why bother doing one's best. It is interesting to note the drop off in U.S. ticket sales between Back To The Future Parts II and III, once again proving that audiences aren't as dumb as the studios think. That Bob Gale has not enjoyed any success since also speaks volumes as to his talent. Overall I view the second part of the Back To The Future trilogy as a wasted opportunity and an insult to the fans of the first film.",

This movie is blessed with many of the original cast (although Crispin Glover is a no show) and some very clever moments. The special effects are very impressive and the movie's bright and funky take on the future is a refreshing change from most sci-fi flicks depressing and cold visions. Once again Christopher Lloyd and Michael J Fox light up the screens with top class performances and prove one of cinema's best double acts.The most enjoyable moments of the movie are the parts when Marty and Doc get to see themselves as they were in the first film, talk about deja vu....and Marty watching himself perform Johnny Be Goode onstage at the school dance is a delight. This sequel manages to keep the story zapping along at a fast and exciting pace and the inclusion of Marty Jnr and Marlene McFly (both played by Fox) add some funny moments as does the holographic shark and the corny Cafe 80's of the future. On the down side I could have done without Elizabeth Shue's overacting and constant gurning ruining every scene she's in but on the whole i thoroughly enjoyed this clever film and  I would highly recommend it.

The cinematography and acting all are very well done except they have one handicap in that a the set design and acting can come off sometimes as over the top rather than comedic and funny. It makes the future setting where most of this happens very dated in a sense. If it would have been more subtle acting and less over the top set designs particularly in the 2015 setting than this would have been on par with the first if not better even.

In fact, some of the most iconic moments in the franchise come from Part II, including the hover-board, which really is fantastic, the Cubs winning the 2015 World Series, and the concept that if you went back in time, you could become rich simply by placing bets on sporting events. Sometimes, the acting and the switching timelines could be\u2026 a little much. I especially enjoyed Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) as the Trump-like figure in the dystopian future. Where the movie excels is posing \u2014 and then answering \u2014 the question of \"Where would my life be, if just XYZ went differently?\" I was disappointed in the lack of time we seemed to spend with Doc (Christopher Lloyd) in this one.

Robert Zimekis and Bob Gale did an excellent job of closing the opening ending of the first film in the most effective way with their two (filmed at the same time) sequels. \"Back to the Future 2\" does the impossible, it reimagines the iconic and just perfect original.\n\nAll my favorite movie moments happen at the very beginning of the movie. The future shown in \"Back to the Future 2\" is probably the most beautiful and wonderful of all shown in the films. The future reminds me of the improved and enlightened 80s with flying cars and with the technical revolution at its maximum. It is shown not as depressive, as we say in Blade Runner or A Clockwork Orange, but as positive and cheerful.\n\nThese 20 minutes of Marty McFly's future adventure (not counting the scenes at Jennifer's house) is just one mind-blowing movie moment. Seriously, everything looks so great, I would give anything to be in such a future, walk along this Hill Valley, go to the 80's Cafe, have a glass of P-Perfect and fly around the city in a car time.\n\nThe general mood of the \"bad\" 1985 is filmed very well, the city resembles one of the largest and most criminal districts in the United States. The ending is no less interesting, the connection with the first series, it becomes possible to look, so to speak, into the cut scenes of the first film and look at the story from a different angle. The final scene is also unique, Thomas F. Wilson plays wonderfully. Beff is probably the best school bull ever shown in the movie.\n\n\"Back to the Future\" trilogy (and especially the first 2 series) is like one big and most important film of my childhood. I remember for the first time I watched the first and second parts, probably somewhere in 1991, while still in kindergarten. These 2 films shocked me so much that even today, after many years, I can watch them endlessly, and they don't bother me. One thing is clear, unfortunately, no one will shoot anything like this. all new sci-fi blockbusters look nothing compared to the Back to the Future trilogy.\n\n10 out of 10",

Marty is able to foil the gang lead by Griff (a descendant of Biff) and thus prevent his future son from being jailed, but before he goes back he tries to smuggle a Sports Almanac back with him before Doc intervenes, but Biff who is an old man and seemingly perplexed by seeing the duo and their time traveling DeLorean, sets out to change the future for himself and his future descendants using the Almanac.

Now if we look at the movie on its own, the dynamic between Doctor Brown and Marty Mcfly is just as enjoyable as before and hasn't changed one bit, the plot isn't as creative as the original but still manages to get us hooked. The pacing however is one thing this movie pulls off wonderfully, just like its predecessor! Not one moment is boring or uninspiring, There's always a fun and quirky scene that sucks us straight into the action! Unfortunately, the special effects, while revolutionary back then, have aged rather poorly, especially the Jaws projection. Another thing I definitely don't like about this movie is how it feels like its desperately trying to squeeze out a final installment, this definitely hampered the final product as it was more focussed on making more sequels while they were at it.

The scene stealer this time is Tom Wilson, playing various versions of Biff with equal abomb, entertaining even when he is the most cruel.  Behind the camera, writer/director Robert Zemekus crafts a true sequel to the movie, picking up where the original left off, but is hit or miss throughout.  The first act is the worst, with some horribly dated depictions of the future 2015, while the second act of the new 'present' picks up a bit.  However, it is the third act where things pick up and what the movie is really known for, as Marty and Doc must journey back to 1955 to make sure the future turns out like it should.

In my opinion, it has a better and more exciting story than the first movie with so many epic moments: Seeing 2015 based on a vision from the 1980s, seeing Marty in the future and it starts off a great character arc that pays off in the 3rd movie and it truly shows the potential of a time travel movie, showing how easily the future can be changed by creating this horrifyingly dark alternate timeline and now Marty and Doc have to fix it by going back to the day of the climax of the 1st movie and it creates such an exciting 2nd and 3rd act as we beg for our heroes to survives as the 2nd act establishes the threat so remarkably well and throughout the 3rd act, we're on the edge of our seats wondering how Marty will make it out of certain situations and it's funny seeing him react to the events of the first movie and can we talk about amazing of a villain Biff is? The acting has also really improved. I can totally see why some might consider this the weakest of the trilogy but for me, it's the strongest",

The acting, visuals, and overall crafting is still good, it is just the script that is the big kicker. It is not boring or slow, but the tone goes all over the place, and the movie does not have a pace, it just feels like events that progress. It is not like the original or the trilogy capper in that the pace and tone mesh well, it's just that this movie struggles with the one thing I liked most in the original.

I loved the scenes of the future, but that part seemed minimized in favor of going to a far grittier version of 1985 that wasn't nearly as appealing to watch. The promotion of Biff from normal antagonist to this cartoonish level of scene-chewing villainy was an unwelcome one to me and I felt there were other directions they could easily have taken the franchise instead. They seemed to delve even deeper into the criticized materialism of the first movie even just by insisting Marty permanently change history through time travel only to keep his own kid out of jail. This series is surely the biggest of all time in the category of having the entire plot revolve around purely selfish objectives. Silvestri's score seemed to always be teetering on the edge between being very, very grandiose and being really invasive and distracting. Ultimately I think this is the worst of the trilogy despite the futuristic scenes almost being enough to make it better than the third.",

Unfortunately the memory and excitement of it was way better than the actual movie. The fictional 2015 is SO hokey, so ridiculous that it takes so much away from the movie that every time I watch it I'm thankful when those first 45 mins are over. It does have it's moments though. The alternate 1985 was a wonderful idea, but the REAL magic is the return to 1955 with two Doc's and two Marty's. Such a genius idea......but the first 45 minutes are so stupid and silly it really takes away from the wonderful experience of the second half. Thank God for Back to the Future III!!",

They incorporated, current present, future, new present & past, making the narrative uneven, with a lot of tone shifts.\n\nMichael J. Fox puts on another great performance, with his character being more than occupied. Marty is more matured this time around, other than his hilarious, unexplained anger issues. Doc is the same ol' doc, being energetic, yet super witty, just not getting enough screen time he deserves. We also got another dose of Thomas F. Wilson as Biff. Biff was all over this film, being just as active as Marty, and maybe even more than Doc. Even though his character isn't the most creative, he is a very talented actor, being able to play all these roles, in one film, and staying consistent.\n\nThe screenplay by Robert Zemeckis & Bob Gale again, brought the same witty, and humorous dialogue, while incorporating a few familiar lines.\n\nThe production design by Rick Carter was beautifully displayed. Carter had a lot on his plate, to perfect all these unique settings, and he completed the task with flying colors. The special effects were heavily relied on in this film, but were done very well.\n\nOverall, Back to the Future Part 2, may not have been the breath of fresh air the first installment was, but it was still loads of fun, expanding on this creative premise, and fun-filled characters!",

I just found time traveling confusing. But watching it again I understand what it is, when you travel back in time in the old years and of course, recent years. Robert Zemeckis is back to direct the second movie, Back to the Future Part II along with Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd returning to their roles. Marty McFly and Doc Brown travel from 1985 to 2015 to prevent Marty's son from sabotaging the McFly family's future; when their arch-nemesis Biff Tannen, played by Thomas F. Wilson again, steals Doc's DeLorean time machine and uses it to alter history for his benefit, the duo must return to 1955 to restore the timeline. OK, so after the first film got it's massive praises back in 1985 the movie itself takes place in the year 1985 and now in 1955 where Marty had accidentally traveled in the year 1955. This one does the same thing and this time something is seriously wrong. Okay, now let me get to something that what changed about the movie. You know Claudia Wells, right? Where she played Jennifer Parker from the first film, she was replaced by Elisabeth Shue because she retired from acting due to her mother had been diagnosed with cancer, so now they reshot that scene in the opening where the first one ended. And of course, Crispin Glover didn't get to return which he want to due to he got paid less money. He sued the producers for using his likeness without his permission. Now there's something I didn't know about one thing that I completely missed out is the fact that I see Michael J. Fox in drag. It always baffles me that I didn't know who dresses up like a woman. I do know however that Tim Curry is always like that from The Rocky Horror Picture Show. I gotta say I really love the sequel much like the first one. I know it's not as good as the first but once you've seen it you grown to appreciate it. It had a funny story that correct the mistakes what Biff has done and it reenacts the same scenes from the first movie without bumping into the other selves. I also liked the funny part where Marty sneaks into Mr Strickland's office to get the almanac but finds the cover of it with the \"Ooh La La\" catalog. Now that I'm going to do the third and final film of the Back to the Future trilogy, Back to the Future Part III. Stay Tuned.",

            "content": "Why bother commenting, right? On a 30 year-old movie that was only ever an adventure lark mostly for kids? \n\nI guess because I am intrigued by the disparity between parts I and II. I watched Part I again recently and enjoyed it so much that I became curious about how the story plays out in the sequels, but I found Part II so boring as to be almost unwatchable. \n\nThe first one works for me because of the devilishly clever butterfly-effect premise that the dysfunction in his family would be healed if his father had met his mother in a display of courage rather than as a victim. Also, there is something about going back to the 50s from the 80s that carries a wistful perfume of nostalgia, and the whole thing is just so much fun that my suspension of disbelief is enthusiastic.\n\nIn comparison, Part II feels like an excuse for adventurous complications -- clever without anything to care about at the core. Marty's chip on his shoulder -- that he won't let anyone call him a chicken -- feels tacked on; it doesn't evolve out of anything that happens in Part I. \n\nAnd watching this 1989 vision of 2015 from the vantage point of 2020 offers nothing of interest. in this 2015, the colors seem to have been inspired by a 1970s Denny's restaurant, and everything that used to roll along the ground now flies -- yawn. The dystopian vision of a rich bully in power should be interesting from our current vantage point, but it is too perfunctory to carry any sting. All is sidelined for the sake of the next preposterous action sequence.\n\nSo you've got the same writers, the same director, the same premise and largely the same cast. One movie, to my taste, is brilliant, and the other is two hours I regret I will never get back. How does that happen?",

            "content": "Now here is a long theory so keep calm and read on. I love this film Firstly because it's not the same film twice like many sequels are. Secondly unlike the other 2 this film doesn't involve the DeLorean breaking down and having to find a solution to get it up to 88 miles an hour. \n\nNext this film is very misunderstood. The whole story of the Almanac was merely a side story, the point of that was this is what happens when money ends up in the wrong hands. The real side to Part II for me is Marty and his problem with being called a chicken. It is only my theory but I think Doc took and Marty and Jennifer to the future so Marty could see for himself what a loser he has become but without actually telling him. It was at that point on that Saturday morning in 1985 when they were going to take the truck to the lake, have a romantic weekend and then just as it all seems too perfect now that Marty's family are wealthy but then the very next morning they come back from the lake, encounter Needles and Marty hits the Rolls Royce and his life is ruined. (Ironic that it happened right next their future home Hill Dale which would later be a run down area)\n\nIf you look at the start of Part II (which was remade due to a new actress playing Jennifer) when Marty asks Doc do they become arseholes, Doc hesitate's and then says no. So into 2015 Doc disguises Marty as his son so he will go into Cafe 80's with everyone assuming he is Marty Junior and telling him what a loser Marty Senior is. So when they return to 1985 (unaware the Almanac has changed everything) they return in the evening and that way Marty and Jennifer don't go to the lake now that it's too late and therefore avoid meeting needles the next morning.\n\nThis was hidden so well in Part I and then we see in Part II, 3 times he is called a chicken and 3 times he causes mayhem. The third time in which all he had to do was walk away from Biff with the Alamanc but let him get to him and his other self hit him with the door and lost the Almanac and although he got it back Doc ended up back in 1885 and Marty even admitted it was his fault at the start of Part III. Being hit by himself with the door was symbolic meaning if you try to prove yourself to idiots like Biff and Needles you are your own worst enemy. Hence Doc's catch phrase: \"The consequences could be disastrous.\" \nAnd in Part I: \"Anything you could do could have serious repercussions on future events!\"\n\nSo now Marty is now punished for his mistake by going back to a time and place where Cowards and \"Chickens\" are not welcome, 1885 in the Old West. But thankfully he bumped into his ancestors, Seamus and Maggie Mcfly and they tell him at the county fair about Seamus's brother Martin Mcfly who also ended up paying the price for trying to prove himself. This got Marty thinking, for example his father George who was a push over in 1955 and what Strickland said at the very start of Part I: \"No Mcfly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley!\"\n\nLater Semus once again gives the hint to Marty on the morning he is supposed to meet Tannen saying he felt like his future depended on it.\n\nMarty then stops worrying about what people think of him and therefore avoids that accident with the Rolls Royce with Doc giving one final piece of advice: \"The future isn't written yet, the future is whatever you make it so make it a good one, both of you!\"\n\nNow this was a long theory but that is what I think the secret to Part II is.",

The second act is where it floundered for me. It shifted and moved in a dark way, and it did have some elements in it, but I think when they killed off George it made it a letdown for a little while. However, Doc Brown's timeline and how it plays out in it, I liked that a lot. With them going back in the past and reconfigure it, it was eye popping. Very clever.

It depicted the alternate universe where Marty's dad was Biff Tannen really well because most of the time-travel films are not as good. It still has the same score and the memorable theme song that the first film introduced. After visiting 2015, Marty McFly must repeat his visit to 1955 to prevent disastrous changes to 1985...without interfering with his first trip. If you watch it very carefully you will see that Elijah Wood made his debut appearance in this film as ' video game boy'.\n\nIt has great visual effects and the use of green screen was brilliant. My only flaws with this movie is that it says that there will be flying cars in 2015, and there still isn't flying cars yet. I need those flying cars.  Overall it is a great film that follows up from it predecessor that i would recommend to people who have seen the first one.

Michael J. Fox (Marty McFly) and Christopher Lloyd (Doc Brown) were great again. They play well off each other and have fun with the roles. It was cool to see how they handled the idea of what futuristic technology would be like in 2015. Things like the Hoverboard, flying cars, the Jaws 19 effect, and the way food is made are all part of the charm that makes this movie so cool. They also did a great job building on the idea from the first film that something being changed in the past could impact things. Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) going back to correctly bet on sporting events has a massive effect on everything and that plays out strongly.\n\nWeaknesses: The way the first film ended, you'd assume this one would be entirely in the future. While I liked how they put a twist on things and the way the course of events can be altered, it does feel like two separate movies with the future and past stuff. It's a bit jarring how quickly things change. The way things involving George, Marty's dad, are handled is weird. I know there were some behind the scenes issues that led to a lawsuit, but it's definitely weird to see the route they went. Also, going back to 1955, the same day as the first movie, makes it feel like something of a retread at times.\n\nOverall: It's not quite as good as the original, but there's still a bunch of fun to be had. The stakes feel higher, the futuristic stuff is way cool, and the charm of the first movie remains intact.",

You know what I mean. But, because the first film had such a devoted fanbase before society used such words, Robert Zemeckis, his buddy Steven Spielberg and some guy Zemeckis collaborated with on the trilogy called Bob Gale decided to continue the story. So now, I've decided to see how the story continues. And, man oh man, do I enjoy it. While it loses a bit of the charm that made the first film a classic, Back to the Future: Part II still remains entertaining enough to remain a great sequel to an even greater movie. From the slapstick humour to its chase sequences, something ALWAYS happens, guaranteed. For me, the movie focuses on one small task having to be done that unexpectedly goes wrong with a twist. Because, aside from the time-travel stuff, the heroes actually succeed in the task they had sought out to do early on but something goes wrong back in their time all because of one simple thing: a sports magazine. The performances here are great as always. Michael J. Fox shines as Marty McFly, Christopher Lloyd appears to, like the first film, have the time of his life playing Emmett \"Doc\" Brown, the scientist who looks the same regardless of what year he's in though when you come to think about it, Christopher Lloyd does look the same today as he did 30 years earlier, and Thomas F. Wilson does a great job of playing Biff and Griff Tannen and the alternate dystopian 1985 does sometimes feel frightening. The Tannens, the best movie assholes of all time. Just ask WatchMojo.com. BttF II remains fun throughout with Robert Zemeckis' assured direction despite the law of diminishing returns taking some of the original's charm.",

The second act, you had to grind your teeth because how Biff changed 1985. Everything was chaos!

This is close enough though, okay!?\n\nThe plot of this film remains one of my favourites- a 1980s imagining of their future, i.e. my present. What would my mum when she was my age think about the future (i.e. the present, where I am now the age that she was)? IT'S CONFUSING BUT JUST GO WITH IT.\n\nPagers really took off (misfire) and cars do too (misfire) and double ties are all the fashion (unfortunately, also a misfire) but man, doesn't the 'future' look cool? Sure, 2015 didn't really turn out to be like that but this film was always going to serve more as a time portal into the past than into the future and the pagers alone give us a good old sniff of the 1980s.\n\nThe real problem with the BTTF sequels is how highly-iterative they are of the original. In this (whilst it's well-done), much of the plot of the first film is simply re-done. There's just something a little lazy about that that I can't quite get past. \n\nFurther, there's a lot going on here- certainly too much, and it can make the film feel a little jumbled. Again, though- let me return to my moto of IT'S CONFUSING BUT JUST GO WITH IT.\n\nThe energy is bigger than ever and again there's the sense that this film was really going for it and, to me, it succeeded. if the story is solid and the passion is there, then I think you can overlook some of the bumps in the road (you know, if you even need roads where you are gong).",

It does what every second chapter of a trilogy should do incredibly well -- set up the finale! In one of my favorite sequences of the film, Michael J. Fox plays three characters -- a middle-aged Marty McFly; his son, Marty McFly, Jr.; and his daughter, Marlene McFly. It's an absolute riot!

The special effects in this movie are okay, nothing mind blowing. Music in this movie is good some parts are thrilling, mainly towards the end of the movie.

Predicting video calls in addition to holograms was spot on and you could maybe count half a point for hover-boards considering these handle-less segways have people believing they look as cool as they would be on actual hover-boards but hover-cars, auto-fitting clothes and Michael Jackson advertising tortillas proved too ambitious. Admittedly I am guilty of being overly ambitious through thinking this sequel would have been more different than its predecessor.\n\nThe original was enjoyable and inventive but the majority of the action was rather pedestrian, particularly when Marty travelled to the past where it tended to entail juvenile behaviour with Biff and his cronies. 'BTTF: Part 2' quickly addresses this by raising the stakes through using three timelines and showing the implications of time travel on the town instead of specifically Marty's family. Problems are subsequently created however because of the disintegrating logic associated with using numerous timelines while the movie also frustratingly refocuses back on Marty and Biff, completely forgetting the neighbourhood issues which were previously hinted as being a significant aspect. Furthermore, the choice to return to the same past events as the first film had me feeling like I had time travelled, but in an annoying way since I had no need to re-visit the past of two days ago. Marty basically retreads his old steps in order to prevent/change certain incidents. Bet they thought they were being smart. Unfortunately, despite incorporating a couple interesting scientific ideas, retreading the same steps fails to provide enough new material for audiences and ultimately came across as lazy writing.\n\nAfter all this ranting, I still have to congratulate it for maintaining the delightfully fun tone and while we are not yet gifted the ability to visit the future, this franchise's easy-to-watch nature is ideal for passing the time.",

So a journey to restore reality begins.\nLadies  and gentlemen, the day that seemed extremely distant has arrived: October 21 of 2015. The future is here and while it isn't as depicted in this film, here we are. It should be said that right off the bag, the fact that the only reason this sequel exist is due to monetary reasons, expectations are low and \"Back to the Future Part II\" proves the clich\u00e9 that sequels are inferior to the original and are the first film done again.\"Back to the Future Part II\" counts with a messy story that's the complete opposite of the simple story of its predecessor, groan inducing scenes, a heavy use of recreations of scenes of the first film, one of the most ridiculous villains ever put to film (last time Biff was a goofy obstacle but know he is the evil that needs to be stopped), the acting suffers a major downfall (Llyod is extremely annoying, Crispin Glover is written out, and Thomas F Wilson is used so much to the point of wanting to stop watching the film), a surprisingly dark portion that doesn't fit in this cartoony trilogy, some characters are not needed, the script is filled with inconsistencies, an enormous lack of originality, and Zemeckis' direction is so desperate to recreate the charm of the original that it comes off as lazy. As you can see there are numerous problems within this film but there are two great elements: The settings (2015 and alternate 1985) are charming as the first is interesting due to its extreme inaccuracy and the latter for its over the top vibe that feels like if Tim Burton was the art director; the fun value is extremely weak but it is still there, and the ending is pure Back to the Future magic. \n\"Back to the Future Part II\" is one of the most desperate and messiest sequels ever made. It has some good scenes but most of the time it is a redo of the original without the simplicity that made it charming. If you adore the first film, you may enjoy this sequel but this is one of the most forced sequels you can find.",

Apart from that, the journey oscillating back and forth between the past and the future is a entertaining joy to watch as our two protagonists race against time righting the wrongs, only to create more impending problems that will threaten the course of their entire existence. With all the brain-popping theories regarding the alternate timeline and continuum, Zemeckis' sophomore effort shines and is set to stand the test of time.",

            "content": "Next up in my series of BTTF reviews is Back to the Future Part II, the film that wowed everyone with a glimpse at what the future could possibly look like, and although it is clearly nothing like it was envisioned in 1989 it is still very interesting to see the 'future that could have been' come to life on screen. \n\nBack to the Future Part II did what all sequels should do, it was larger in scale, it took bigger risks and it took the series to a whole new dimension by really focusing on the use of time travel. Now although it was bigger and the timelines got a whole lot more complex, topping the first film was nearly impossible but they tried their hardest and it payed off, making this film also an instant classic. Like its predecessor, this was also an endlessly entertaining film, still capturing the same humour that the first film did so well it manages to make you laugh consistently throughout. The characters of Doc and Marty again have great comedic timing and their chemistry is like no other film and it adds to the realism of these characters relationship. Whilst also maintaining that comedic aspect, the film also does spend quite a bit of time getting pretty serious and developing the plot for later in the film and for Part 3. \n\nThis film had the daunting task of having to top the first one, and how do you do that? Rather than going 30 years in the past they decided to go 30 years into the future. But why stop there? lets go 30 years into the future then 30 years into the past in another timeline and then 30 years into the past again just to mess with people. Although there was a lot of jumping between timelines in this film it managed to hold itself together very well without seeming like it was moving too fast. As expected, with all of these time jumps, the timeline of events is going to get a little more confusing, but the film i thought did a pretty great job at keeping audiences informed as to what was going on. There were a few exposition scenes that were a little too 'heavy' on information that could have been spread out a little. Having just watched it for like the 10th time, it all makes sense to me but for a first time watcher it may take another viewing to fully grasp the timeline changes. A very minor thing in a film that still does time travel better than 98% of time travel films out there. \n\nOne of the things that this film is remembered for is its visualisation of the future. Seeing all of these technological advancements in terms of cars, and clothes, and shoes, and hover-boards was incredibly mind-blowing for me when i watched it so you could imagine how it must have been for an audience that was even further away from that possible reality. It was a very interesting contrast with other more dirty dystopian futures you see in most sci-fi films, the cleaner, brighter look made it so much more memorable. Like i said, they are the scenes everyone remembers, the hover-board chase scene is an iconic action sequence that will never be forgotten, the sequence in Marty's future house was amazing seeing all of the small but significant advances in technology that people would only dream of. Many people often forget that the film also does represent the future in a very dystopian environment, and i thought in its own way, that was a very interesting juxtaposition to put in this film. Although it wasn't as fun and lively as seeing the cleaner future it was definitely interesting to see how greed and a money driven future would look like. Looking back on it now, i would say that the Dystopian representation of the future isn't any more far off than the Cleaner, more technologically advanced one, just saying. \n\nBut one of the most impressive sequences for me was when Marty and Doc travel back to 1955, the setting of the first film, and have to go around this time period whilst avoiding their other selfs from the first film. This is what really wowed me in terms of the incredible film-making and visual effects that were used in order to make it look like they had actually travelled into the setting of the first film without compromising what the first film set up. The shots were placed perfectly and the use of footage from the first film in combination of recreations of scenes from the first film from different angles was incredible, and for a film released in 1989 it was amazing to see. It also has what i think was the most exciting and fun ending sequence of the series that had me laughing, and in suspense the entire time. It closes off the story of this film perfectly and sets up the next film in a similar way to what the first film did. It may even be one of my favourite movie endings ever, i get goosebumps every time i watch it. And that is also due to the return of Alan Silvestri's incredible score and BTTF theme that gets me every time. \n\nAgain, the attention to detail was incredible, with fantastic call-backs to the first film and the little details that connect the alternate timelines timelines together, and also some foreshadowing for what is to come in Part 3, Robert Zemeckis' love for this world and these characters is on show. In the end, this film goes bigger, it goes to more places and it retains everything you love about the first film. It does lose some of that magic that you feel when watching the first film but it is still a masterpiece and a classic that even helped to elevate how good the first film was upon return viewings. - 9",

The story continues where the first movie ended. I do like the plot, as Marty and Doc travel to the Future, a changed present and back 1955, where you get to see scenes from the first movie from a totally different angle. The film was made back-to-back with the third and final chapter 'Back to the Future part 3'. Starring Michael J. Fox (Family Ties, Class of 1984), Christopher Lloyd (Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Piranha 3D), Thomas F. Wilson (April Fool's Day, Camp Nowhere), Lea Thompson (Jaws 3D, The Little Rascals), Crispin Glover (Beowulf, What's Eating Gilbert Grape) and Billy Zane (Titanic, the Phantom). Ready to go back?\n\nIn 1985, Doc Brown (Lloyd) persuades Marty McFly (Fox) and his girlfriend Jennifer Parker to join him on a trip to 2015, where they must help their future children. But while they are there, the old Biff Tannen (Wilson) uses the Delorean to travel back to 1955 to deliver a Sports Almanac, containing all the results of major sports events between 1950 and 2000. When our friends return to 1985, Marty is shocked to see that the world he knew has changed. His mother Lorainne (Thompson) has married the rich and successful Biff after Marty's father George (Glover) passed away, while Doc has been committed to an insane asylum. To undue these events, Marty and Doc will need to travel back to 1955, where they have to be careful not to interfere with Marty's previous trip...",

The first part of the film with all the memorable but ultimately wrong predictions of 2015. This is also the weakest part of the movie and only exists to deal with the appearance of Jennifer at the end of the previous entry (played by a very annoying Elizabeth Shue instead) and the mention of 'something has got to be done about your kids'. The plot kicks off when Biff steals the Delorean to go back to 1955 and in doing so creating an alternate 1985 where the 'Warriors' wouldn't be out of place. A clever and intelligent plot ensues. Back in 1989 I was one of the last of my peers to see it but did get to hear tales of confused minds. The twists of time travel get us to relive the original film from another angle and the final scene is very satisfying. Not as endearing as the original but still fun.",

Another prop that's being made now is pepsi perfect but it didn't go nation wide, only sold 100 bottles but one prop that's during into an actual thing is power laces, when Nike confirmed that they were being made I automatically say, \"do they come in wide\". I love the Story and plot, fun time for the family and can't wait for the third movie.

A time when I truly thought hover-boards were going to come into existence. A time when 2015 seemed so far away. And now, well...it's not. And there are no hover-boards. There are no flying cars. There are no self-drying jackets. \nBack to the Future II didn't get much about the future right, but it did have a lot of cool ideas. When the movie came out, it was my favorite BTTF film. Maybe it was the look into the \"future\", maybe it was the darker tone of the film, but I absolutely loved it. 25 years later...meh. \nAll the future stuff seems really forced. I don't think Bob Gale or Bob Zemeckis ever meant to make a sequel to the original, let alone 2 sequels. In fact, the Bobs are on record as saying that the whole thing with Doc Brown saying \"there has to be something done about your kids\" at the end of part 1 was all just a joke. But unfortunately they kind of painted themselves into a corner when Universal said they wanted a sequel. They HAD to start from where Part 1 left off. Hence all the crappy future scenes in part II.\nBut luckily, the movie gets better once all the future silliness is over with. The Biff \"revisionist\" 1985 is kind of cool in it's bleakness. It was pretty gutsy to kill off George McFly too (even if it had more to do with contract negotiations going sour). But the movie really gets going in its 3rd act.\nWe get to see something that's never been done before (or since). When Marty and Doc head back (again) to 1955, we get to see part 1 from a whole new perspective. The whole forward in time, then back in time, then back in time (again) can get a little confusing, but the way it's shot make it fun to watch. And if you've seen the 1st one a few times like I have, the revisiting of certain scenes will make you nostalgic for the original movie.\nAnd THAT'S where this film shines. The \"re-making\" of the original movie in the sequel is the best part about it. And then you realize that you just could of watched the 1st movie and be done with all the shenanigans.\nBut that's the old guy in me talking. The movie really is a great lead-up to the third and final chapter. Without #2, there couldn't have been a #3, and the third one manages to actually be a really great film in its own right. But that's another movie for another day. My overall opinion: not a bad movie, just not a great one either.",

Partly because it plays like a trailer for the first and third installments (literally ending with a trailer for part 3), and certainly because it tries to cover too much ground. To be honest, I've always found part 2 to be a bit of a mess. An entertaining mess, which certainly has its moments, but still. A mess.\n\nWhen you start playing around with time travel stories, it's pretty easy to paint yourself into a corner. The first film in the franchise kept things simple, so for the most part, everything made sense. Part 2 though strains credibility from the moment Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) shows up to take Marty (Michael J. Fox) to the future on a mission to prevent his son from getting arrested. Why couldn't the Doc take care of that himself? Why didn't the Doc just tell 1985 Marty about his son's future? The entire catalyst for the story is completely flawed, and once this train wreck of a plot gets going, there's no stopping it!\nthumb_bttf2-marlene\n\n\nIt's not all bad though, and it's interesting today in 2014 to see how the folks in 1989 envisioned the future. Some how I don't think we're getting hover boards and flying cars any time soon! But hilariously it looks like they predicted Google glass! The visual effects have aged very well, and it's clear that all involved were having a great time playing multiple versions of themselves from different time periods. Especially Mr Fox who shows up playing his own daughter!\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nYou absolutely have to see the first film in this trilogy before taking on part 2. It's difficult to follow as it is, so don't make things harder for yourself by starting with the first sequel. One fun thing to try with part 2 is to score how accurately the production design predicted the future. I'd give them a C.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThe transfer to Blu-ray is pretty decent, and I recommend you watch this in HD. The makeup effects have improved slightly over the original, but there's still some flaws.\n\nBest element for me: >\n\nI did enjoy the last act. It's essentially the finale of the first film, but shot from different angles as the second version of Marty sneaks around. Pretty clever stuff really.\n\n-> http://www.TalkieGazette.com\n\n-> http://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\n-> http://www.twitter.com/talkiegazette",

This film is great, but not that funny or inventive as the first film. The first film had a right mix up of all the ingredients, but when it comes to the sequel, the fun is slightly on a low. The second half is super like the first film, but this film looses some grip trying to make sense to the events that occurred on the ending of the first film. They just made up a cheap story in order to get a continuation, but anyway they make use of it in the second half. The film gets to have extreme pace once they get back to 1955 again. But in the first half, the things about the children and future seems to be peripheral. I believe that they should have brought a new story out instead of carrying on. But since they just did that we had a series that actually had continuation, like the LOTR Trilogy. This film is heavy on tension and sci-fi and at times is over-dramatic, but that's not a fault.",

This movie can get a little dark cause of what old biff does meanwhile he go s in to the time machine car so he can make his own world that he kind of be king so Marty and DR. emmit brown must leave jenifer to save the future. As they do that Dr. emmit brown leaves without Marty so Marty must confront the other Dr.",

The idea that our characters can use the time machine to go back to the same time period more than once- so that there are several versions of the same person running around trying to achieve different goals. The climax is fun in large part because you basically get to relive the climax of the first film but from different points of view. This whole trilogy features a fair amount of campiness, with the cartoonish villain of Biff Tannen appearing in various forms throughout. The level of overacting, and campiness reaches nearly unbearable heights during the 2015 \"Future\" sequence- particularly Michael J Fox playing his 1985 Marty McFly, his son, crossdressing as his daughter, and his future self (The latter two feature some tremendously poor makeup). The most unbearably overacted performance comes from Thomas Wilson Jr as \"Griff\" Tannen- the grandson of Biff in 2015. Almost the entire cast is at one point covered in poorly done makeup to attempt to make them look older, younger, or to play totally different characters. It starts to feel a bit gimmicky when the same 4 actors play something like 14 different characters (or different iterations of the same characters). This film is very messy, both in its story and technical creation. If you love these characters and this world established by the original you'll probably be entertained. Just don't expect a classic, top tier, adventure/comedy, both sequels are far inferior to the original.",

It suffers the same inferiority that all respective sequels have when stemming from a classic, but in comparison to most other sequels, this is one hell of a follow-up.  We see Marty and Doc launched this time into the future, for what turns out to be a very silly, very manic, but undeniably hilarious forty minutes.  Things take a turn for the worse when Biff acquires the means to get rich, and thus creates his own parallel reality which thankfully doesn't last long, because this is where the film loses its bearings a little for me.  This darker turn just feels more like a stain on the fun-filled fantasy element achieved by Zemeckis and the chemistry between Fox and Lloyd up to this point.  However, it does set into motion a fascinating dilemma, which then pulls the story right back into 1955, where the movie finally finds its foothold, and cleverly intertwines with the events of the original film.  Overall, 'Part II' lacks the charm and the subtly most would have expected, but it still dishes out some deliciously fast-paced entertainment, and every time I watch it, I tend to like it more and more.",

            "content": "Back to the Future Part 2 is quite the mixed bag for me. With the first movie instantly becoming one of my favorite movies, I had some high(ish) expectations for this. Sadly, for most of the run time, Part 2 is unsatisfying, lazy, and rather flat. The first half of the movie did very little for me. Halfway through, Marty goes back to 1955. Thankfully, this second half of the movie completely saved this from being a truly awful sequel.\r\n\r\nPart 2 picks up right where Part 1 left off. Doc Brown returns to 1985 immediately after the events of the first movie. He takes Marty and Jennifer into the Delorean and shots to the future, 2015 to be exact. Marty must return to prevent his future son from getting into trouble that will negatively affect his future family. But while in the future, old Biff Tannen steals the time machine and brings a sports almanac from 2015 back to 1955. He gives it to his past self, and alters the space time continuum. Faced with a horribly altered future, Marty must return to 1955 and prevent Biff from using the almanac to bet on sporting events.\r\n\r\nThe scenes in 2015 and the altered 1985 really didn't click with me. They were just too weird and unfunny. The movie seemed like it was rambling around, looking for a way to set up a decent story. Once we get past all that, we are given material worth of a sequel to a truly fantastic movie. Sadly, more than half the run-time is spent on the uninspired set up.\r\n\r\nMichael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd return as the protagonists Marty McFly and Doc Brown. They are both as good as they were in the first movie, but they sadly aren't given very much good material. Fox is given a chance to play an older Marty, which is kinda fun. Doc Brown's role is resigned to story exposition, though Lloyd is still brilliant.\r\n\r\nThe supporting cast is nearly as memorable or funny as the supporting cast from Part 1. Thomas F. Wilson once again makes a great villain. Lea Thompson is underused as Lorraine, and only has one scene. Elisabeth Shue takes over the role of Jennifer and does a decent job. She isn't given enough material to really show if she is really good in the part; but she does make the character's transition from Claudia Wells seamless. What is noticeably lacking from the sequel's supporting cast is Crispin Glover as George McFly. Sure there were plenty of reasons why Glover's return to the franchise didn't happen, but he is still greatly missed.\r\n\r\nThe production of the 2015 scenes is interesting to see. Flying cars and the crazy clothes are certainly not how it's like today. Yet the filmmakers still did get some things right...amazingly. Robert Zemeckis technically does a respectable job with this, but not nearly as good a job as he did on the first. The finale hoverboard chase is really impressive and fun. But mostly, the whole production just feels like a step back. Even Alan Silvestri's sophomore Back to the Future score fails to leave an impression.\r\n\r\nWhile problems do abound with this sequel, there definitely is some upside. If you can get through the slog that is the first half of the movie, you will be rewarded with a very clever and fun second half. Following a classic is never easy, and Back to the Future Part 2 proves that. The second half is so good, that I almost gave this a positive rating. But all things being considered, it deserves exactly the rating I'm giving it.\r\n\r\n\"The time-traveling is just too dangerous. Better that I devote myself to study the other great mystery of the universe: women.\" 5.5/10",

I love the sneakers, I love the hoverboard and I love everything about the year 2015. The film also has the return of many memorable characters.

The second act is very dark and uncomfortable to watch due to its predecessors fairly light hearted nature and the also the tone set in the beginning of this film.  While the second act does add more suspense, for me it was real strange and not at all that entirely fun to watch.  Second act aside, the first act picks up where the last film ands very well and isn't that all to bad to watch.  The third act on the other hand is perfect, the plot of this act is just marvelous.  Allowing both films to run parallel to each other was risky, but played ever so well.  Overall, Part II shares all the hallmarks that mad the first film great, but its second act is a pretty big negative for what otherwise was a near perfect film.",

Fox) and his girlfriend \"Jennifer Parker\" (Elisabeth Shue, who has taken over the role from Claudia Wells starting in this movie). \"Brown\" informs them that there is a problem with their children in the future, and insists that they come with him.\r\n\r\nIn the future, after \"Doc\" renders \"Jennifer\" unconscience when she begins to ask way too many questions in the excitement of being in the future, \"Doc\" and \"Marty\" find \"Marty Jr.\" (Fox), who is a complete nerd, being harassed by \"Griff Tannen\" (Thomas F. Wilson), the future grandson of \"Biff Tannen\" (Wilson), who is the high school archrival of \"Marty's\" father, \"George\" (Jeffrey Weissman and, in footage from the original movie to show the original actor's face, Crispin Glover). After \"Marty\" helps his nerdy, but look-alike son, with \"Griff\" and his gang, he comes across an antiques store and purchases a magazine that lists sports results from 1950 to 2000.\r\n\r\nEventually, the future version of \"Biff\" gets his hand on the magazine and steals the magazine, and steals the DeLorean time machine to go back to visit his younger self in 1955.\r\n\r\nNow, \"Doc\" and \"Marty\" have to go back to 1955 again, get the magazine and avoid their other selves that are already there (from the first movie).\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most original sequels ever made, as it perfectly inserts many scenes from the original -- many of which were reshot at different angles. It is also one of the few where multiple actors are playing more than one character, even if the character is the same person. You get to see many versions of the same person in other words.\r\n\r\nThe performances are pretty fun, especially when the movie is in the scenes set in the future. Not only are we introduced to new characters, we see the same actors playing these comical characters -- especially Fox, who plays two characters in the future -- \"Marty Jr.\" and his sister, \"Marlene\" (who gets very little screen time compared to \"Marty Jr.). It must have been difficult for the cast to create variations of the character they originated in the first movie.\r\n\r\nThe special effects in this film are not very original, but still hold up for the most part. While watching, I only saw a few instances where the special effects have weaken over the years, and it was obvious that they were inserted during post-production.\r\n\r\nI was pretty disappointed in the future \"Hill Valley\" for the most part. None of the vehicles looked authentic to me, and the clothing was fairly laughable with the choice of colors and design. There was some originality in the future -- the \"Jaws 19\" marquee, the self-tying sneakers (with light-up Nike logos) and the famed \"Mattel Hoverboard.\"\r\n\r\nThe comedy is only worth some chuckles through out the entire movie. Some jokes are just rehash from the previous film, and are not set up well to the point that you don't expect it. However, at least one scene in the future is a nice rework of one of the more memorable scenes of the first movie.\r\n\r\nMake-up effects are not up to par in this movie. You get simple make-up effects to only fairly elaborate make-up effects. The \"aged\" effects are not good in my opinion. It is obvious that the future version of \"Biff\". as well as the future version of \"Jennifer's\" cleavage, are prostetics (especially the cleavage, which looks more like rubber more than it does skin). Some performers even looked as if they had obvious hair dye jobs, instead of wigs.\r\n\r\nA lot of the music came from the original movie, with some new songs add in. I think only one song was used really well to set the tone of the scene, the rest were just there if you ask me.\r\n\r\nOne thing that worked well, although it was a bit odd, was the scenes from the original movie reshot from the point of view of \"Marty\" and \"Doc.\" If you notice, \"Marty's\" father, \"George\" is seen not looking at the camera, or his face is blurry due to being in the background of the scene where the pricipal characters are being shot. You are seeing a different actor in the role since Crispin Glover did not sign on to be in this movie, but you hear his voice from clips taken from the first movie.\r\n\r\nThis film can get a bit confusing at times, due to the time paradox that \"Doc\" explains to \"Marty.\" Sometimes, you forget which version of the characters you are watching -- especially when another version is in the scene.\r\n\r\nThis is a good movie for the entire family. The language, and violence is pretty mild, and the comedy is never crude or adult-oriented. The only thing I would suggest is that you watch the movies back-to-back.",

They don't surpass it, but when it comes to sequels they're some of the best. The continue the great story, and deserve to be acknowledged. \n\nPart II has Marty (Michael J. Fox) travelling forward to 2015. Here he encounters his son, but that's only a small part of the story. Marty gets a sports almanac which is stolen by an older Biff, and given to Biff in 1955. Thus, Marty needs to get it back. He travels to an alternate 1985, where Biff is basically king after betting everything he had in sports. Marty's mom (Lea Thompson)  is his \"servant\" and George McFly (Previously played by Crispin Glover) is dead.\n\nMarty goes back to 55' in order to get the book back so that the future can be restored. The strong point, again, are the characters. The best thing about II is that we see them as older people, younger people, and their families. The writing is just as clever as in part I, and is complex but not confusing.\n\nThe acting also again is great. J. Fox seems to get more comfortable with this character with each film. Lloyd is also great as Doc. However, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) steals the show. In this one, Biff is the main villain, and we see lots of him! We see him old, young, nice, mean, and all kinds of other ways.\n\nI also love the future technology. There's a Jaws 10, lace up shoes, and hover boards. There's also this pizza maker thing, that was a bit weird. Oh, and before I forget, there's Flea as Needles.\n\nI wouldn't compare this to the first film, because the first is perfect, but it is still a fantastic film. There's some dopey makeup, but it doesn't fully deteriorate from the film. If you haven't seen it I would see it, but I still prefer the first. See it if you haven't!",

The reason I didn't go into detail on the first film is because in the last bridge, the first film gets revisited. Let's recap: After his previous adventure, Marty is whisked away by Doc into the future (2015 to be precise) to alter an event that could harm his family. However, he comes into contact with an almanac & believing that he'll grow into a loser like his father, he buys it but Doc throws out but his arch rival Biff Tannen comes into contact with it, steals the time machine & gives the book to himself in 1955, which is where they overlap. BTTF Episode 2 was a huge hit at the time but was criticized for being slightly darker than the first episode & thematically it is. Regardless, take it for what it's worth. I liked it (along with the first episode). Stay tuned for BTTF Episode 3!",

When Doc Brown came back at the end of the first one and the sequel was set up who knew what was going to happen next? The production of this is cool because it picks up and retarces the steps of the original. Elisabeth Shue is neato but where's original Jennifer? Where's Crispin?

Wilson\u00e2(TM)s part that borders suicidal.  In fact it isn\u00e2(TM)t just the Wilson\u00e2(TM)s performance that is borderline suicidal, but the first half of the film, is so unbelievably tacky and awful that it seems like a completely different film from its marvellous predecessor.\n\n        However at some point during the middle of the film, cannot quite remember when, the film transforms into something remarkably similar to the first film.  Because whilst it\u00e2(TM)s enjoyable to watch, the second half is a sort of photocopy of the first film (similar to a photocopier because there are minor differences, like colour and bits are cut off the edges etc.).  In fact they are so similar that the climax mostly takes place where the end of the first one took place, at the school dance.  I think a good example of the similarity, is the way that one scene from the first one is taken and recycled into the second one, using a hoverboard instead of a skateboard is the only difference.\n\n        This film is split into two parts, a truly awful work of cinema and then a copied piece of cinema.  It seems Zemeckis and Gale have been so hinged on the success of the first one, they didn\u00e2(TM)t want to exit their comfort zone.",

Still it is very enjoyable, with the acting from Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd as zany and as likable as ever before and the special effects even better than in the first film and that was a hard feat.

For me it s a combo of the two. While this was a fun movie it was nowhere near as good as the first one with characters constantly running around and the film never giving the audience or the characters a chance to breathe. There was not much story or character to this film just one giant marathon that you are exhausted at, which makes it nowhere near is as good as the first one. Thankfully, some of this running around is fun and makes it a decent watch but at the same time it destroys a perfectly good movie.

The humor is still here, it's still got some incredibly tense moments, and Marty is just as likable as ever. The only problem I have with the film is that, aside from lacking the magic of the original, it feels to much like a retread of the first movie.\r Scenes from the first film are constantly being repeated throughout, making this feel less like a sequel and more like a way to remind us of what happened in the first movie so that we may better prepared for part 3, which this movie even already has scenes from at the end! This is especially odd because part 1 had only come out 4 years ago, so the memories of that movie couldn't have been that well forgotten. Still, what original plot the film does have manages to keep it afloat and worth watching.\r It might not have the magic of the first film, and its existence may just be a way to set us up for part 3, but it's still got enough moments of originality here to make it worth a watch for fans of the first.

Every plot thread, scene, character, did all it had to do, none of them may have shined extremely bright but they all did a perfect job.\r In this one, the plot threads don't really work as well. One of the most important elements of BttF2 is that you can't have 2 same people meet or else that'll create a time paradox. Here, when Biff from 1955 meets Biff from 2015...nothing happens. I know Young Biff doesn't recognise Old Biff, but still, the plot point falls apart, and it's one of the bigger plot points of the movie.\rOther elements like how Doc Brown refuses to change the future, but gets Marty to change the future to save his kids, is a bit ridiculous. If he's ready to change the future that much, why not help Marty stop being an idiot and not get in the car accident he's supposed to get in? It's not much of a stretch and it'd certainly help much.\rMost scenes do their job as well as in the first movie, but don't feel as tight. Why?...The first one had a pretty much flawless quality of always introducing plot devices, foreshadowing and emotional relationships statuses without any asperity to it. The leaflet that informs you that the clock tower will be struck at exactly 10:04? Perfectly introduced. The meeting between Marty's mum and him instead of his 1955 dad? Perfectly introduced.\r Here, it's not so good. Things that happen don't make as much sense and/or are a bit too easy or not as well executed. It's not far worse, just slightly, but while the first one was constantly amazing with that, this one isn't.\r The second thing that doesn't work too well in this movie is how drastically it travels through time. You go to the future, an alternate present, the past, all in one movie. It's fine in terms of logic and sense(mostly anyway) but emotionally, it's not. You don't have the time to build emotion for any of the characters in this movie, except for the ones you already know from the last movie.\rGranted, that's pretty much 90% of them...But that's the issue. They bring almost nothing new to the table. There's certainly a lot of tension and emotion for Marty and Doc's predicaments, but not for their characters, or any new characters. The alternate 1985 Biff and Lorraine? You don't see them long. Old Biff? Don't see him long. Young Biff, you know him from the last movie.\rMarty and Doc end up on the upper end of this since they have a lot of screen time and we already know them and learn more about them, but they're really the exception.\r Apart from these inferiorities, BttF2 is definitely still a great watch. It's still fun, full of tension and action and comedy, and although quite more sad and tragic than the last one, it's just as good as a lighthearted story.",

The first one is more unique but the sequel is also amazing. Since both are truly great movies it does not really mater at the end of the day. While it is also a science fiction comedy it is also different and has a bit of a darker tone than the prequel. The movie starts at the end of the prequel (At the sequel teaser) were Doc Brown appeared again to bring Marty and his girlfriend Jennifer into the future in the year 2015 to prevent serious family troubles there (This sounds fake now as we are already past 2015;-). However because of some carelessness this is just a small inconvenience to the events that happen when they return to the past. I will stop here with the set up to avoid spoilers. The story is magnificent and the twists are remarkable. They could play it safe but tried something new. This works well, is immersive and enjoyable from start to finish. Bonus: Many years later it was interesting to make the comparison between the movie imagination and real year 2015 (The imagination won;-). I will praise the creativity here for the story and worldbuilding. Much of the pop culture knowledge of fictional time travel is from this movie. Again they mastered the balance between seriousness and humor in a way that none harms the other. Also again the great cast delivers a performance that enhances the movie. Lets start with Marty McFly played by Michael J. Fox who again fully delivers his role. Same for Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown who is our beloved eccentric or slightly mad scientist;-). These 2 have such a great chemistry in the franchise. Thomas F. Wilson returns as Biff Tannen and even surpasses his performance from the first movie. It is no wonder why he is one of the most memorable antagonist of his (movie) age. The rest of the cast also adds to the great performance and I will praise all of them. Where this movie is clearly a bit weaker than the prequel is the soundtrack and it is still a good soundtrack. Overall this was a great sequel. It has the strength of the original and fresh ideas. The story and humor in combination with the actors work well. It is an easy recommendation and I will praise director Robert Zemeckis for this great movie.",

This is a sequel that has a lot going for it, so much so, that it becomes a little over-saturated with so many plot-lines and so many different situations that our characters get into.\r Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is back, and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) takes Marty and his girlfriend Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue) to the future of 2015 where he tells them about the situation involving both Marty and Jennifer's kids. While they're both in 2015, Marty comes across a guide book that is able to tell him about all the sports events and results between 1950 to 2000, with Marty being equipped with easy access to a time machine, he is able to go back and predict these scores and is able to make money from it all.\r But, the doctor isn't so keen about this idea, as he claims that he did not invent the time machine to predict scores and gamble for financial gain. But, it turns out that Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) has managed to find the book and use it for his younger self and alternate the present that is 1985 in the worst way possible.\r The movie is certainly fast-paced and visually eye-popping. The fictional take on the future of 2015 is filled with pure imagination and the film does its job with special effects that still hold up magnificently well, the film is still as funny as ever, even though some parts of the film may seem a little far-fetched. There are times where he movie does feel a little unnecessary as one would ask \"Why would the Doc tell Marty about his future when he could control his own future and prevent disastrous results?\".\r There is still a lot to like about this movie, even if it does feel a little repetitive and overly melodramatic, if not overstuffed with too many character cliches. The young hero is the young hero, the crazy scientist is the crazy scientist and the big bad guy is the big bad guy. Some of the lines of dialogue may be a little ironic for comedy purposes, but at times can feel a little... eye-rolling, such as \"You're not going to believe this, we got to go back to 1955!\" followed by \"I don't believe it!\". I get that it's used for irony, but it also felt a little cheap in terms of what kind of comedy it's supposed to be.\r A good sequel, not as great as the first.",

I don't understand anything about time travel when I watched the first film. I just found time traveling confusing. But watching it again I understand what it is, when you travel back in time in the old years and of course, recent years. Robert Zemeckis is back to direct the second movie, Back to the Future Part II along with Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd returning to their roles. Marty McFly and Doc Brown travel from 1985 to 2015 to prevent Marty's son from sabotaging the McFly family's future; when their arch-nemesis Biff Tannen, played by Thomas F. Wilson again, steals Doc's DeLorean time machine and uses it to alter history for his benefit, the duo must return to 1955 to restore the timeline. OK, so after the first film got it's massive praises back in 1985 the movie itself takes place in the year 1985 and now in 1955 where Marty had accidentally traveled in the year 1955. This one does the same thing and this time something is seriously wrong. Okay, now let me get to something that what changed about the movie. You know Claudia Wells, right? Where she played Jennifer Parker from the first film, she was replaced by Elisabeth Shue because she retired from acting due to her mother had been diagnosed with cancer, so now they reshot that scene in the opening where the first one ended. And of course, Crispin Glover didn't get to return which he want to due to he got paid less money. He sued the producers for using his likeness without his permission. Now there's something I didn't know about one thing that I completely missed out is the fact that I see Michael J. Fox in drag. It always baffles me that I didn't know who dresses up like a woman. I do know however that Tim Curry is always like that from The Rocky Horror Picture Show. I gotta say I really love the sequel much like the first one. I know it's not as good as the first but once you've seen it you grown to appreciate it. It had a funny story that correct the mistakes what Biff has done and it reenacts the same scenes from the first movie without bumping into the other selves. I also liked the funny part where Marty sneaks into Mr Strickland's office to get the almanac but finds the cover of it with the \"Ooh La La\" catalog. Now that I'm going to do the third and final film of the Back to the Future trilogy, Back to the Future Part III. Stay Tuned.",

However though, I can understand the medium critics. This movie is by far not as heart-warming and binding as the first one and I'd even say the story is a little lesser interesting. Objectively, this movie is outstanding with it's effects and overall charme and it has legitimately become one of a movie classic. With the characteristic acting of Michael J. Fox and the character trades within the relations of each of the protagonists to each other, at first this movie is a good drama and family story. But there comes the trouble: Time-Travel dilemma, which is the reason I like this one best. It's a known thing that time travel IS theoretically possible and everyone has heard about the paradoxes going along with the imagination. The thing about this philosphy is, that as past is left behind us already makes it easier for one to see himself in the future, as future is always yet to change. And that's exactly the strength of that movie, giving fictional proof that minimal changes can cause an entire different outcome. As the first movie is a told story that would make you think but stay on distance, this one allows you to reflect yourself and think about the decisions you made and make and how they affected you and will affect you. Now where 2015 is gone and with it our hopes of flying cars, it's still nice to see how people 30 years before thought it would look then. And who knows, maybe some event in the past could have caused the future we see here?And that's the point. This movie re-creates the real world beyond our imagination, because unlike the past, we are a part of the future and we can change it directly.",

To fix these events they will have to go back and review the events of the first film for another perspective, the film knows how to play very well with the elements of a supposed future such as the haveboard, nike sneakers that tie themselves, The problem here is to use a simple premise to introduce what really matters in the 1985 frame that is governed by Biff, this version of the past is bleak and looks dirty, in that part the Movie loses a little comic tone and becomes much more serious, with marty trying to deal with the changes of the world and his familia.to fix this situation they return to the events of the first film in what is d Eve the best part of the movie, it is very interesting to see the events of the first film from another angle, but the movie has some problems anyway and did not surpass the first the performances are as good as the first movie and the CGI was right Advance, is a good plot with a story that amuses and charismatic characters.note 84",

In the first movie, Marty McFly and \"Doc\" Emmett Brown traveled until the 1950s, until Marty's parents' dating years, using a time machine built from a DeLorean. Now, the pair will need to go to the future in 2015 to prevent Marty and Jenniffer's children from becoming delinquents and dragging the entire family to the bottom. But in the midst of it all, they still have to stop the perfidious Biff Tannen from making a fortune at the expense of inside information about future sporting results. To correct the future and save the present, therefore, it will be necessary to intervene in the past, and return to 1955.The film is clearly the continuation of its predecessor and has direct connection with it. The mix of sci fi and comedy continues to succeed but it does not prevent the feeling that this movie is, in essence, more of the same as we saw before. If we forget that brief foray into the future (which for me is already a distant past, as I write this text a few years after 2015), the film is nothing really new. At any rate, it's funny to see how, in the 1980s, someone imagined our time. Flying cars? If they only knew that we were more concerned with greening cars than flying them ... But of course, nothing should be taken too seriously here. Speaking of ecology, the film suggests in one scene that DeLorean replaced the use of plutonium with organic debris and rubbish, perhaps using an original type of composter. Curious to check this out.There is little to say about the direction of Robert Zemeckis, or even about the cast, that has not been said or observed in the previous film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd continue to dominate the film, which will be a constant throughout the trilogy. In this movie, however, the stakes of Thomas F. Wilson, an excellent villain, and Elisabeth Shue, who gain, despite their preponderance, still fall relatively sidelined for much of the movie, literally falling asleep.Special effects, visuals and sound are inseparable and important part of any sci-fi movie and here they work quite well. I thought the future was quite interesting, with ultra-modern cars and some crazy ideas, but as I said, it's not something we should take too seriously. It also struck me as interesting to see the same actor playing two versions of himself, although it was clear how this was achieved by splitting the screen.It's understandable why the movie, like the whole trilogy, became so popular. Despite being weaker than the first film, it retained its features well and honored its predecessor, leaving clear signs of a continuation. The trilogy as a whole has aged very well and still has class, charm and style, which cannot be said of all films made in the 1980s.",

Back to the Future II was made in 1989 by the same director (Robert Zemeckis). For me Back to the Future II is the best sequel to the original as we get to see Michael J.

This book can make you rich as it has all the answers and correct answers to  bets to make you a fortune but sadly it's misused causing a horrible future existence so Christopher Lloyd  and Michael J. Fox go back in time to stop the Almanac book from being used by Biff to create a better future.... Back to the Future II is full of great scenes, great characters, weird characters and amazing parts to it and is without doubt my favourite sequel to the original.... Back to the Future III was pretty poor compared to this one and Back to the Future II in my opinion is just as good if not better or equal to the original but the third installment was quite bad. The idea of George McFly being dead in a horrible future with Biff being rich and wealthy and married to Lorraine (Lea Thompson) was a great idea and many of the scenes are done great especially the Delorean scenes and stuff and Michael J.
