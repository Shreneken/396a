            "content": "Considering that Adam Sandler was young and inexperienced, I guess you can't fault him too much for appearing in this terrible film. The amazing thing, however, is that this didn't kill his career once and for all! Why is this film so bad? Well, the biggest problem is that it's supposed to be a comedy but it's amazingly unfunny. The story is about a guy who wants to be a stand-up comedian and features a supposedly professional comic in the film as well--yet there wasn't a single funny line in the film. It was as if they'd asked Mr. Spock or a robot to write the jokes. Additionally, the rest of the film is written so very poorly that there really isn't anything to recommend the story...nothing.The film is set on a somewhat dilapidated cruise ship. Adam Sandler is a lowly waiter and puts up with lots of abuse from everyone. Frankly, no one is this mistreated on any job and it's hard to find anyone who is a bigger loser than this character. He's just so pathetic that it makes you cringe. At the same time, he looks up to a comic on board the ship that has less charisma and charm than any undertaker! The guy is so obnoxious and untalented that you are left wondering if this guy could get a real job on this planet or only in bad films like this. The answer is actually pretty obvious. I was surprised at this character, actually, as I don't think I've ever heard a character from the 1980s that curses and much or as colorfully as this guy...and yet we are expected to believe he actually gets paid to talk?! As for the rest of the cast, it's mostly a bunch of beauty pageant contestants, though you wonder WHAT sort of pageant this is. That's because some sport sashes that have the names of states or cities and some have sashes with names of countries--but often the women have no accent and look like they can't even spell the names of the countries, let alone having come from there. The best example is the blonde lady who has a typical American accent...and she's Miss Jamaica!? Additionally, the ladies have no charisma or personalities--they are just eye candy--just bodies to jiggle past the screen.So, we have semi-sexy beauty queens and comedians who are about as funny as hemorrhoids--this is NOT a recipe for a good film! About the only thing even halfway likable is Sandler. He's unfunny but seems like a nice young man...a horribly stereotypically Jewish young man saddled with the awful name \"Shecky Moskowitz\". Wow, that was subtle!! The only other positive thing I can say about this film is that it makes you forget some of Sandler's other bombs, such as LITTLE NICKY. Oh, and if you are wondering, I did really enjoy many of his films (such as REIGN ON ME, WATERBOY and THE WEDDING SINGER). I just marvel, however, at how indiscriminate he is in his choices of film projects.Giving a film a 1, for me, is reserved for films such as those of Hershell Gordon Lewis, Ed Wood, Al Adamson, Ted Mikels and the like. I don't give this score out routinely but I do think this film also deserves this score, as it is unlikable, cheap and stupid from start to finish and it's obvious why this film is currently ranked within the 100 worst films of all time on IMDb.",

            "content": "Even if you're a huge Sandler fan, please don't bother with this extremely disappointing comedy!  I bought this movie for $7.99, assuming it has to be at least halfway decent since my man Sandler is in it and because I assumed some women would get naked (judging by the R-rating and scantily-clad women on the cover).  Well, there are quite a few scantily-clad women, but none get naked.  I'm not sure what point this was in Sandler's career, but I'm guessing it was even before his SNL days.  I can be wrong.  This is like watching one of his home movies.  He might look back at a cheesy movie like this and reminisce about the good ol' times...but we (the audience) are left to dry.  This is hardly a \"movie\"!  Sandler does a lot of talking to the camera, and even admits at one point that this is \"no-budget\" movie (that's right, not a low-budget movie, a NO-budget movie).  So our job is pretty much to laugh AT the quirky characters.  There is no steady plot, it's like an extended sketch comedy show--but a crude and badly written one.  That guy who played the nasty comedian was completely annoying and it was implausible in the first place that he would receive such a mass audience.  And Sandler finds his comic inspiration by saying the one classic Henny Youngman line \"Take my wife, please\" and the audience is on the floor?  I'm not even going to TRY to make any logic here.  Sure, Sandler's current and recent movies are not known for making a lot of sense (the penguin in \"Billy Madison,\" the midget in \"Happy Gilmore's\" Happy Place) but the comedy works.  This is a strictly amateurish work, and even if you're curious about Adam's early days in film--you still won't be interested.  You're better off checking out his start on SNL or maybe his underrated role in \"Mixed Nuts.\"  Of course, the Sandman is not the only actor wasted in this thankless vehicle.  Billy Bob Thornton also makes a short appearance, Billy Zane (\"Titanic\") has a supporting role and the great Burt Young (from the \"Rocky\" movies) has a significant role.  This awful comedy will most probably be collecting dust on the 99-cent rental section of your local video store--and rightfully so. \nMy score:  3 (out of 10)",

Was it the camera angles, and I have to say this film had some of the most awkward and cheaply placed camera angles I've seen in any film? Was it the immature and painfully unfunny humour, down to the juvenile dialogue and jokes that make you cringe so much your face is aching still after watching the film? Was it the broken and predictable structure of the story? Or was it Adam Sandler's truly irritating performance, that makes his performances in Jack and Jill, Little Nicky and You Don't Mess With the Zohan seem award-worthy in comparison? Or the wasted, and I mean wasted, talents of Billy Bob Thornton? Or even the single most unlikeable and obnoxious characters of any film to have Sandler starring in it? Hard to decide, seeing as everything was as bad as the other. All in all, I had heard Going Overboard was bad, but I wasn't expecting it to be THIS bad! 0/10 Bethany Cox",

What I didn't realise however, was that there could be one THIS bad. I'll give you an idea how incredibly poor this film is - the funniest dialogue in it goes like this: \"Knock Knock\", \"Who's there?\", \"The big stinking man\", \"The big stinking man who?\", \"The big stinking man - is YOU!\". Yes folks, it really is that bad. Billy Bob is only in it for about two minutes (I guess he needed the work at that time in his career), and the rest of the movie is painful. For some reason though, although it's undeniably awful, I don't hate it. That's probably because I save my ire for any high budget, special effects laden junk like \"The Fast and the Furious\" and not a \"no-budget\" flick like this one. 2/10 at a push.",

First off, there is not one funny or clever line in the entire movie honestly. It is so unfunny it's pathetic. There is surprisingly not much crude or sexual humor, but the f-word is plentiful. The budget is really low, and that also ruins the film. It takes place on a cruise ship, but it seems they only had money to rent out a small boat and only had money for 10 ship extras, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton.

In fact it was more like a rock than a gem.This is a story of gibberish that was so boring that you could not keep up with what was happening on the screen. The situation was utterly ridiculous and the lines were so unfunny I actually felt sad for the actors. Perhaps it was my VCR that made the picture of the film look sloppy but it seemed like it was filmed as a high school project rather than by professional adults. I was glad when I saw the review of others that I was not alone in panning this film. And with all that said, I still feel cheated out of 10 cents.",

They need to be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity. That's the only fitting punishment I can think of for releasing something this bad. The shooting reminds me of the movies I used to make for class projects on a big old VHS cam. The acting isnt much better. I think the only difference is that there are a few cool cameos. Yay, who cares... Shecky Moskowitz is unfunny, and the ships comedian is an even bigger loser. That's about as much of the plot as I understood.Overall it's the worst movie I've ever seen. I own it on DVD and have given it to many co-workers to watch.

Sure, there are many \u2013 millions? \u2013 that do adore him and more power to them. And I could easily suggest they watch this movie to prove my point on how incredibly untalented, unfunny and dumb this lucky sob is. But\u0085in Sandler's defense (GULP,) anyone could have a shaky start such as this one. So, while this disaster of a film isn't really proof of much\u0085it is a hint of what his movies will eventually become.I came home one night from work nearly two months ago \u2013 yeah, it's taken me awhile to finally write this \u2013 and all I wanted to do was watch an incredibly bad movie to laugh at and not with. Normally, I wouldn't select a Sandler film \u2013 they're typically so bad, my mouth is agape more than anything else, but when I learned of both the viewer rating on this (which is currently at 1.9/10 stars) and that it was his first film, I had to see it.This movie disgusted me more than made me laugh. Still, to this day, it's like sh|t is still on my clothes that I cannot discard and I am powerless to that awful smell. I am not kidding: this movie is that bad.It didn't help that the movie started off with the vilest of cartoon intros. If I was able to post pictures in this review, I would provide you with proof of how insane, repulsive and gross they are. And I am not talking about potty humor or body parts. I am speaking of poorly drawn cartoons of Sandler's dumb facial expressions.Had the rest of the movie continued as an animated feature with that cartoon caricature of Sandler, I surely would've turned off the movie. Well, I should've anyways, because it didn't get better.Yeah, the budget seemed like it was at near zero and Sandler, himself, warns us of there being no money, but the lack of any talent from anyone behind the camera, in front of it or even holding it is more disturbing to me than the money fronted to make this happen.Basically, and I am giving the plot too much credit with that word, Adam's jealous of another \"funny man\" on a cruise ship and spends most of the movie daydreaming his way into the spotlight.Nothing works here. Not a single line, not a single \"joke,\" not a single frame. I would say the movie was written by preteen boys with their horny minds, but even they would find this movie in offensively bad taste.Sure, I despise Sandler's work. This wasn't going to change my mind one way or another. But, nothing, NOTHING, could've prepared me for this train wreck of absolute garbage.* * * Final thoughts: #1 this movie came out in 1989\u0085in the SUMMER season. Why couldn't this have pushed his future career overboard?? #2, it *did* have a budget. Of $200,000. If you dare, and I highly recommend you don't, please, PLEASE, tell me where any of that was spent. #3, this doesn't even fit in the \"so bad, it's good\" category. You can watch any of the most recent Sandler movies for that category. Say, the past two decades worth of this films.",

            "review_title": "\"Going Overboard\"... Portrait of a Viewer's Descent into Madness...",
            "content": "I am going to offer a statement up front as a prologue for this review- I like Adam Sandler. I am a fan of his work, both comedic and dramatic. I always make an effort to see his films. In addition to supplying me with laughs, he also offers the occasional deep and moving performance in his serious work. So I am not coming into this review as a hater by any means. I just wanted to say that.Adam Sandler's first film, \"Going Overboard\", was a 1989 release, directed by Valerie Breiman. It follows the lead, Shecky Moskowitz (Sandler), a struggling comedian working on a cruise ship. It is notable for its quiet release, and the fact that a whole lot of people don't know about its existence. It is also notable for it's exceptionally poor quality (being on IMDb's Bottom 100 list), and at times painfully unfunny jokes. I tried to watch this film twice before today. Once by myself- in an effort that ended after less than 10 minutes. And a second time yesterday with two friends, this time making it 15 minutes in.And today, while writing this review, I forced myself to watch even more of this flick, in an attempt to make it at least one third of the way through, so I can be more fair and just with my analysis.The film is sloppily put together. For some reason, Shecky almost constantly breaks the fourth wall, and speaks to the audience. Now, this is a technique that can work if utilized properly, but here, it seems forced and contrived, and it never really adds to the proceedings. In fact, it makes almost no sense whatsoever. They attempt to expand this idea, with other characters (such as his best friend) noticing the \"camera\", or having other passengers (notably beauty queens on the ship) appear randomly to talk to the camera, but it doesn't feel natural. The comedy is extremely unfunny. An opening scene featuring Burt Young (how they got him in the movie is beyond me) makes an unfunny attempt at using porno-titles etched on the sides of video tapes for cheap laughs in a gag that is DOA. A barely animated opening title sequence tries to solicit laughs using a caricature of Sandler, but it fails miserably. Much of the humor is too drawn out, or too brief. And many of the gags fall flat as a pancake. An example that pops into my mind is a scene where we, for no reason, see the \"villainous\" character dancing on the deck in front of some sunbathing women for about a full minute while snazzy music plays in the background. It made no sense, yet looked like it was trying to play for laughs. I didn't laugh once. The most creative gag was Shecky giving a Bloody Mary to a patron which had been soiled by a seagull's excrement... and it wasn't even funny, just gross.The acting is uniformly abysmal, with Sandler alternating between trying way too hard in one scene, to looking bored and just reading his lines in the next. His rival, \"Dickie Diamond\" is portrayed as a lewd and vulgar comedian, and he's meant to come across as a bully that you hate, but the performance doesn't work, and makes you pity him and feel as though he may be handicapped in some way.The direction is unsuitable, and the film can't even muster the quality of a 70's television commercial in terms of visual aesthetics. (I have read that due to an error, the film had to be shot without vital lens and filter packs, which the crew had forgot, hence it's flat and cheap look.) There is no discernible story by any stretch of the imagination- reading a synopsis elsewhere, it is suggested that terrorists, thugs and other assorted villains will raid the ship later on in the film, but I can't see how or why. Literally nothing happened in the half hour or so I saw. The film has no guidance. The editing is also bad all around, and despite moving very quickly, it drags and drags... it's jarring yet also boring... It feels like snippets of a few dozen different skits strung together, with all of the punchlines removed. There's no flow, and nothing seems to make any sense, or contribute to any real effort at a story.Really, as much as it pains me to say this... this is the first movie I've encountered that I have been unable to sit through. It's literally painful to watch.I have to give this a 1 out of 10, and that's coming from a Sandler fan. It isn't the worst movie ever made... but it's up (or rather, down) there.EDIT: (June 8th) I have watched another half hour of the film. My review still stands as is.",

It's a good thing that it was instantly forgotten, otherwise we wouldn't have his more watchable films, particularly the nearly half dozen he's done up to this point with Drew Barrymore.As a waiter aboard a huge cruise ship, all he does is comment on the various shipboard entertainers while desperately seeking his own chance at becoming a stand up comic. The shipboard comic is completely unfunny, having a laugh that instantly makes you want to reach through the screen and push him overboard, or in my case wishing that a giant shark would suddenly jump up and swallow him whole.Then there's the crude rock singer, a man with as much talent as a drum with a hole in it. He gets a bunch of disgusting moments with various groupees, eye rollingly hideous and embarrassing. The women themselves whom Sandler keeps getting rejected by get their own big introduction, and they are as funny as the worries of what happens to a piece of hard candy when swallowed whole. A 24 hour marathon of \"Out to Sea\" would provide more laughs than this.

            "content": "I always wanted to watch this movie because it's considered by many one of the worst movies of all time, it always sat in the Bottom 100 (the list of the 100 worst movies of all time) and it's also known as Adam Sandler's debut (and I personally liked most of Sandler's movies). And sometimes I like to watch a terrible movie just for laughing at his inanity. But unfortunately, this was NOT the case. This movie really bored me to the point that I wanted to left it, but since it's not fair to dish a movie entirely after leaving it, I stuck with it.The movie is set on a cruise ship. Adam Sandler plays a lowly waiter and is badly treated by almost everyone. This already makes the viewer sad and it makes you wonder if there are any other characters that suffer this type of abuses (even in real life). At the same time he is envious of a comedian that works on the ship that is painfully unfunny (and I am not joking, he looks even WORSE than Larry the Cable Guy) and it makes you wonder if the guy was crass and obnoxious just on purpose. As for the other members of the cast, we have Burt Young as a general that watches the movie on his TV, Billy Zane as King Neptune, a pointless bit role by a then-unknown Billy Bob Thornton and various beauty pageants with the same amount of personality of a door-knob!So, the movie consists of comedians so unfunny that you'll rather hear dogs barking Jingle Bells for a year straight, paper-thin plot, and semi-naked ladies that pass on the screen from time to time. This makes it for one of the dullest movies of all time. But at least this proves that debuting with a God-awful movie doesn't necessarily destroy your career. Adam Sandler debuted with this and he managed to star in good movies such as 50 FIRST DATES, BIG DADDY and CLICK; tho he has also other bombs in his career such as JACK AND JILL (now in the Bottom 100), GROWN UPS 2 and THE RIDICOLOUS SIX.However, I knew that GOING OVERBOARD was bad, but I wasn't expecting THIS level of awfulness! This movie truly deserves all the hate since is cheaply made (with camera work so shoddy that it can give you a migraine), boring, badly acted and unfunny. It's no surprise that this movie has a score of 1,8 and it's among the lowest rated movies on IMDB.",

            "content": "\"Going Overboard\" is a comedy that is part campy, part raunchy, a tad bit exploitative, and completely unfunny. It has the distinction of being Adam Sandler's first film ever, not just his first film where he had the leading role. Unfortunately, it is also Sandler's worst film.The only reason you would probably know about this movie is because it received a very wide video release in the mid 1990's, after Sandler had become a breakout star of \"Saturday Night Live\". Today, even though his current movies haven't received the greatest of reviews, he's still a bona-fide movie star, and among the most successful former SNL stars in the show's history. This movie shows, however, that at the age of 22, he still had some work to do.If there's any reason to sit through this 97-minute movie that feels a hell of a lot longer, it's to see how Sandler started out as a young, struggling comedian. He obviously took his prior experiences in bombing in clubs, and made his character, Schecky Moskowitz, who is probably not all that different from Sandler himself, a bit more poignant.However, the rest of the film is draggy, uneven, and really unfunny. The story is scattered and one-dimensional, the subplots feel contrived and out of place, and almost everyone in this movie seems as though they try way too hard for a laugh, including Sandler. In fact, it makes no sense that Sandler's character, as a cruise ship waiter, envies the cruise's comedian, Dickie Diamond (Scott LaRose), when he isn't really all that funny.The only really good scene is when Sandler, struggling to make his cruise audience laugh, spontaneously meets Milton Berle, who plays himself. I also liked the addition of a laughing track when Berle told his jokes. Ironically enough, it seemed as though the movie did not try as hard to make you laugh when the laughing track played.The only other big star the movie managed to get at the time was Burt Young, who plays General Noriega from a country in central America despite not looking Hispanic at all. It's also obvious that his scenes were shot long after the filming on a cruise ship was complete.There are also some appearances in this movie from then-unknown actors who made it big later, such as Peter Berg, Billy Zane, and (perhaps most surprising) Billy Bob Thornton. Fortunately, they would go on to do bigger and better movies.If there is only one reason to see \"Going Overboard\", it's to show that when it comes to show business, especially comedy, you have to start somewhere. Sandler still had a long way to go in finding his comedic persona. Fortunately, he still comes off as likable in this movie. It's just too bad that the rest of the film could not quite catch up.So \"Going Overboard\" is a big miss. Its story and its comedy needed some major work. It being a \"no-budget\" movie, as Sandler puts it in the beginning when he breaks the fourth wall, is no excuse.",

It uses tired, bottom of the barrel comedic techniques - consistently breaking the fourth wall as Sandler talks to the audience, and seemingly pointless montages of 'hot girls'.Adam Sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to make it as a successful comedian in order to become successful with women. When the ship's resident comedian - the shamelessly named 'Dickie' due to his unfathomable success with the opposite gender - is presumed lost at sea, Sandler's character Shecker gets his big break. Dickie is not dead, he's rather locked in the bathroom, presumably sea sick.Perhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all time.",

His character's constant acknowledgement of his hidden comic genius and frustration regarding humorous material seems to come more from Sandler than the script. The film is nothing compared to his blockbuster feature films, such as Big Daddy or even the corny Billy Maddison. Unfortunately, Sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent, successful and funny manner when this film was made, much like his character. The majority of the film's \"jokes\" come from Sandler having conversations with himself, usually over his unrecognised comic talent and beating himself up because he's too ugly and can't get women. The film is hard to watch too because it doesn't treat itself like a real film. Sandler talks to the camera and the viewers throughout the film, often referring to the film's low budget or questionable content. The film is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to watch. I immediately wanted to forget I even saw this film after it was over, for fear that if more found out about it, it would ruin Sandler's career.

Now to tortu^^^^^ test the resolve of these new staff members, we would issue them with a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of Goodmans DVD player that had this film as a free gift, got round to sending their DVD player back, they never failed to send Shecky back also. Our new staff would be forced to use only Going Overboard to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with.Now, as to why this film is so bad, where do I begin?Adam Sandler, who can be so, so very funny, as in Happy Gilmore, or the Wedding Singer, must have been having one hell of an off day. The rest of the crew stank, and what is it with Billy Zane? His name crops up in several of the worst movies of all time, and he is a decent actor. Crazy. The production quality is absolute zero.I would have been inclined to give this a zero if I could, because they didn't even have the guts to call it by it's full name 'The Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz' on release.

            "content": "To say that Adam Sandler had a lucky escape after this is quite an understatement. For those who have seen his recent comedy treats such as 50 First Dates and Anger Management, you'll have to watch Going Overboard to believe how lucky he is. Maybe directors felt sorry for him, I don't know. What I do know is his performance in this was pretty damn awful, even taking into account that this was his debut. Seriously, he looked as though was doing as part of an apprenticeship or something, also because he looked about 15 in this. There were parts in the film where I ALMOST felt for his character. It just feels as though his character didn't achieve anything real. He tried too hard to be funny but pretty much all of his jokes were desperately unfunny and cringefully lame. But another reason is because everyone else...well...you couldn't give a dead monkey about them to say the least. Their acting is awfully awful AWFUL. That's right Dickie Diamond, nobody gives a flying f*** about you either. He is a jerk who sticks his finger up at literally everything he resents. Miss Australia is annoying and weird because she hates Shecky yet she falls to Shecky's best friend despite only speaking to him for two seconds. She is a spoilt brat. And that general/cat litter hermit who plays the film. Jesus...............................His character hardly looks like he's left that office in his entire life. Or possibly that desk even. Burt Young's acting in this is astonishingly crap. One scene that'll stick in my head for the rest of my life is the scene where he orders his inept terrorists to kill Miss Australia. Not the particularly the fact they set to kill her, but the \"reason\" why they do so. Those terrorists have some awful lines in this film. And from that killing scene, here is a *SPOILER* piece of the \"script\":NORIEGA: She says I smell like like an old pizza TERRORIST 1:(sniffs Noriega) Like an old, um...cheese pizza? TERRORIST 2: (Sniffs Noriega with really cheesy face) With anchovies? TERRORIST 1: What kind of crust? NORIEGA: What does that matter? I want her killed. TERRORIST 2: A round circle-shaped pizza?Oh boy does it get worse: \"Who is she? Star of the video-tapes?!\". JEEEEEEEEEEEEZ. And then that song Noriega mumble-sings afterwards. \"It's a sad world when your head looks like a pizza\". WTF?!!???!!!?! I'm surprised if anyone's looked that a pizza in the same way after watching that. If you have one while watching this, you'll very probably throw it the TV. Also the plot, apart from Shecky's story, is random and don't make sense. Like Miss Australia getting together with Shecky's pal as I mentioned above, and the terrorists becoming the ships star comedians. What the hell?! For crying out loud, the script writers obviously didn't realise that they aren't THOSE type of jokers. They're jokes are worse than Shecky's.All in all, even people who like this film have got to admit IT'S SO AWFUL THAT it's good. Well some parts anyhow are classic so bad-it's-good. Other parts are just painfully plain bad. You should only see this film if you like Adam Sandler and not feeling depressed. And even then you might want to kill something. Possibly yourself. I can't quite emphasise enough what a piece of novelty crap this film is. Even if it is a no-budget.",

I thought it might just be because this movie's old, but after watching it, I found my real answer. I mean, who in their right mind watches this stuff? Sandler plays Schecky Moskowitz, an obnoxious, unfunny comedian. He decides to take a job as a waiter on a cruise ship. The thing in which Sandler talks to the screen, and explains what's going on in the movie, including him saying the only reason they made this movie was because they had access to a big boat and gorgeous babes does not score one laugh. I wouldn't be surprised if that was actually the only reason they made it. No one in their right mind would make this.

What follows is a bizarre 'story' including beauty queens, General Noriega, two inept killers who want to be comedians and Billy Zane as Neptune God of The Sea!This is a terrible piece of cinema that should never have seen the light of day and has no glimpses of the great comedy that Sandler went on to produce.No matter how big a Sandler fan this film is simply not funny.

Had previously watched bits and pieces of this film years ago (but never finishing) while now having watched the film in its entirety.What makes the film bad are the effects, the acting, the lack of an interesting plot, and the overall jokes.Sandler's character is likable as the lead but tries too hard to make the audience laugh (this film has a feel that it isn't really a film with Sandler speaking to the audience and looking at the camera as in \"breaking the fourth wall\").Just about everything about the film is terrible but that was expected. Too cheesy and not in a \"so bad it's good\" kind of way.Also the character of Dickie Diamond (the main comedian in the cruise) was far obnoxious and wasn't funny in the slightest, with spilling out far many F-bombs, and it got progressively more as the film goes on.Although he was slightly entertaining and the film goes downhill when the guests think he died because his hat went overboard in the sea. Though his character gets locked in the bathroom (which made no sense as to why a public cruise would have a bathroom door being locked from the outside, and supposedly no guest or crew member had to use it- as it appeared hours had passed). And isn't he familiar with the cruise ship- wouldn't he have known? It made very little sense.Then when the terrorists arrive (again trying far too hard for laughs as it came across as just pathetic).Nothing more to be said about this film that hasn't been already. One of the worst films ever seen but given its budget, perhaps shouldn't be considered as such.Even if you are a fan of Adam Sandler and may want to give this film a try, be warned as it is terrible- it makes Jack and Jill look Oscar worthy.",

He certainly is not the unfunny, harmful presence that jealous people like Albert Brooks and Janeane Garofalo blame him to be. He's not a genius, but he's not supposed to be. \"Billy Madison\" may be his most cerebral comedy to date. Billy Zane may be under-appreciated in some circles as well. Billy Bob Thornton (that's three Billys in a row) may have sold out and we may never see a \"Sling Blade\" or \"One False Move\" again. But be thankful for movies like \"Going Overboard,\" a movie that is so painfully unfunny, it really hurts not laughing for that long. Some may say that having watched this movie, that writers must have tried to actually think of unfunny things to put in a movie. I beg to differ. The writers of this movie do not exist, for no one who wrote a line of dialogue in this script is a writer. There are bad writers and there are awful writers. There are abysmal writers. These guys are simply not writers. No one can make up something this unfunny, you actually have to be unfunny, you actually have to have never made a single solitary soul laugh to be able to come up with something like this. Either that or you're a little kid trying to write an adult comedy, in which case is funny. In that context, this movie is quite morbidly fascinating and is of interest to those who like to watch reputable actors perform a grade-school play (I do, and I think it is a riot not only because this movie I'm sure haunts Peter Berg, but because the cast thinks they're making something funny and they so aren't-THAT is what is funny.)So in conclusion, pretty much don't see this movie, or watch it and see how context is obliterated.",

When will it end?!\" It's about Sandler wanting to be the ship's comedian, but all he is right now is a waiter. This doesn't have the usual hilarious Sandler comedy, it barely even has comedy. You may be thinking I'm not that big of a Sandler fan, but I am, big time. Please whatever you do, do NOT waste your time or money. Even if it's free, don't get it. You'll be very, very disapointed.",

            "content": "I might as well briefly explain what I enjoyed about the film to get it out of the way. For one, I enjoyed the two terrorists who were sent to board the ship as they seemed to be having a lot of fun. Also, I'm generally a sucker for dreams, hallucinations, and other scenes which occur in a character's head and, while those scenes weren't great per se, I enjoyed a couple shots in them, like the overhead shot of Sandler in a straight jacket and the darkness surrounding the boxing ring. Finally, I suppose it was cool how the frame narrative was occurring at the same time as the seemingly present day cruise ship scenes. That's about all I can say about this film though as I disliked just about everything else. Bad comedy films usually have a few jokes here and there which I find clever, but virtually every single joke in this film missed the mark for me and made little to no sense. The few jokes which did make sense weren't particularly clever and were below average or competent at best. Given the opening scene, the film is clearly aware that it's a bad comedy film, but this scene actually does the film more harm than good. We're clearly asked to root for Shecky, but since his jokes are just as bad as Dickie's, it makes it hard to care about his outcome. In addition, virtually every single actor in this film (Adam Sandler, included) lacked charisma, minus the aforementioned two terrorists. I would've been fine if everyone gave hammy, over-the-top performances as this might've gotten a few laughs out of me, but virtually everyone here didn't seem to be having any fun, nor did they appear to be into the film. Finally, with the exception of a few shots I mentioned up above, the camerawork wasn't that good either. The (unintentional?) Dutch angles looked godawful, some of the camera angles were so poor it was difficult to follow scenes of characters simply moving around, and the chase scene at the end was overlong and humdrum (Sandler changing his shirt in the middle of it was nice though). So yeah, just a really awful movie which is a strong contender for the worst film I've ever seen.",

            "content": "Released in May of 1989, this $200,000 comedy farce is really only notable for being the first feature film to star future A-list funny man, Adam Sandler. But before he matured, or was even cast as a player in Saturday Night Live, he starred as a struggling comic onboard a cruise. After his recent string of uninspired, unfunny cash-grabs, it's easy to forget Sandler was once a hilarious comic with some truly great material... sadly however, we get almost none of that in this sorry excuse for a film. Instead, he puts on stupid voices, mugs for the camera, and generally acts like an incompetent goof for the majority of the 97 minute film. The supporting cast includes Tom Hodges, Scott LaRose, Billy Zane, and Billy Bob Thorton - none of whom are the slightest bit memorable. The story plods along to the incessant sounds of a steal drum calypso, bland jazz, and cheap Muzak, also the actual presentation style is curious and inconsistent.Sandler himself breaks the fourth wall to introduce us to the story, immediately apologizing for its \"no budget\", and then he's shelping the viewer around boat like we're watching his personal vlog. But other sequences are conventionally shot, and edited for some reason - I hesitate to guess what director Valerie Breiman was possibly thinking. The lethargic and pointless narrative is worsened by constantly cutting away to Miss Universal confessionals, ridiculous dream sequences, and Burt Young as General Noriega who is actually watching the film itself on VHS, who defends his honor by shouting at the TV, \"We'll see who gets the last laugh, you left over worthless kangaroo vomit!\" Besides being awfully paced, the R-rated movie is really quite uncomfortable and awkward... every scene plays out three times longer than it needs to, almost as if they were deliberately padded so the picture could qualify for \"feature length\". With unrealistic dialogue, and empty characters - this film is devoid of conflict and tension, making it at true struggle to actually sit through. It's no surprise this film presently sits in IMDb's bottom-10 rated movies of all time... it is just so painfully boring, I regretted watching literally every scene. \"Going Overboard\" is a \"Terrible. Not even enjoyable ironically.\" With no redeeming qualities and nary a single laugh whatsoever, it's a wonder Sandler actually managed to have a successful career after piece of GARBAGE.",

I don't disagree with many of the criticisms this film gets - but I don't think it's as bad and devoid of merit as it's caricatured and regarded to be. The setting of a cruise ship is always alluring and glamorous and seductive and pleasing to the eye - as are the girls. True, more (i.e. something) could have been done with the Miss Universe beauty pageant sideplot; not least because Adam Sandler as an aspiring comedian isn't very interesting ... or even convincing. As a protagonist he doesn't win my sympathy at all (he's just as unfunny and undeserving of stage time as the antagonist comic he replaces).

He keeps talking directly to the camera, turning it into one of those (The main character knows this is a movie, movies), which I think is an ineffective comedy tactic.

Now this film does have some funny moments,most of them are by the comedian when he's not telling jokes and by a rock star and he's promoter.Adam has a little comedy in it,but not the one you think.He's more goofy and you can tell it's his first film ever made.Looking at this first before Adam did Happy Gilmore,Billy Madison,The Waterboy,Little Nicky,Punch Drunk Love,etc.Will not make yu won't to be his fan or see these movies.So looking for a few laughs then rent.But I tell ya you will be disapponited.",

            "content": "Since my freshman year of high school, I have been one of the world's biggest fans of Adam Sandler and his work. I heard his first CD and from then on, I was hooked. So naturally, when I heard for the first time that he was starring in his own movie (Billy Madison), I got all my high school friends together, and we all went to the theater to see it. I loved it and was forever hooked on everything Adam. I collected every film I had ever seen him in for years to come; First on videotape, then later, on DVD. Then I found a website called IMDb.com where I copied a list of every motion picture he had been involved in (Producer, Actor, even Cameos), and proceeded to complete my collection. This brought me across a movie entitled Going Overboard. After purchasing the movie at a 2nd hand video store, I sat down and was subjected to the smelliest piece of cinematic excrement since Rubberface, to which I think this movie holds more than one similarity. The movie assaults the viewer with dull comedy which is apparently supposed to be funny because it is so bad. In my opinion, a good comedy needs no plot, or maybe more accurately if your situations and characters are funny enough, it doesn't matter what your plot is. (For an example check out Harold and Kumar go to White Castle or \"Dude, Where's My Car?\".) This movie's plot would have done just fine had the comedy been there to back it up. However, as it is, the ridiculous plot is actually dragged further into the abyss by the awful one liners delivered by the finest comedian of our generation. In my opinion, it is a shame that Sandler didn't have the sense to pass on this opportunity. In his defense however, if you had a chance to star in a full length motion picture, no matter how crappy the script, could you pass it up?",

Basic plot is: He knows he's in a low budget film, he wants to headline the ship's stand up act and he hangs out with some very strange folks.

It really is not his fault though, it's just simply down to bad writing. Stupid, horrible, delusional writing. This movie could probably be seen as 'The Young Ones on a Cruise' but even the Young Ones were funnier than this. This really is not a comedy. A Comedy makes you laugh or maybe even smirk.

I had remembered hearing this film was AWFUL but after reading comment after comment about this being the worst film EVER - well - I just HAD to see it. Luckily Netflix has it on Instant Queue...time to see how awful it is!!!!!! Of course this is EARLY Sandler - early around is his time on the awesome Ken Ober show Remote Control on MTV. And from the git you know the film has NO budget - they are making a film based on what they have with no real script to speak of. For some odd reason - while I think the film does move kinda slow - I do find parts of it quite funny.There's a great cast - as most people mention. I'm not sure how they got Burt Young or Milton Burle. Of course the rest are very young in the film: Billy Bob Thornton had just moved to L.A. a couple years before and was taking any roles he could get. Billy Zane and Peter Berg get to join the fun - as does frequent Sandler collaborators Allan Covert & Steven Brill. I found it GREAT that Sandler's best friend on the boat was Tiny from Revenge of the Nerds 2. God bless you Tom Hodges! Anywho Sandler is a very young guy working on a bad cruise line. He's very awkward, not happy with his job as a waiter, and dreams of being a comedian. The comedian onboard is a hairy, loud guy who Sandler abhors. He mopes around the ship trying to raise his confidence by talking with his friends.NOW - I've been on cruises - I think the creepiest part of this film is Sandler moping around looking at couples as they kiss. Of course the character is 'sad' - but if I was on a cruise ship and saw this mopey waiter lurking around eyeballing the guests I would report him. That's just me - but then again I'm trying to analyze Going Overboard as most others have - which is probably the downfall.Is the movie bad? Sure. But as someone who has watched LEGIONS of bad movies I really think this isn't too bad. It's great to see this early collab of Sandler, Covert, and Brill - and fun to see other Hollywood greats like Thornton and Berg so young. If you go in expecting Billy Madison or any Sandler past 1994 you will surely be disappointed. Actually...if you are MOST people you'll be disappointed. For me? It's no Mr. T in The Toughest Man in the World - but then again what is???",

We have tried a few times to watch it to see if it gets better and i think we have made it as far as 17 minutes in. So in case you haven't got the drift of this post please never ever watch this movie you'll thank me for this advice someday.

I have recently written a letter to Mr. Sandler demanding my dollar back as well as another $10 in compensation for the hour of my life he took from me as well as pain and suffering.Anybody who wants to say that this movie is so bad that it is good, is out of their mind. This movie has entrenched itself very firmly in the traditional bad category. Production value sucked, Adam Sandler apparently had not figured out how to be funny yet.This film is a train wreck comparable to watching a 12 year old on a webcam trying to recite Shakespeare monologues, but not being able to pronounce or even clearly read the lines, much less act them out. Even worse, You would have to sit through an hour of that kid doing this.

The only retroactively funny (more like pathetic) thing about this \"comedy\" is how Sandler's lame character Schecky complains about the dropping standards of comedy being reduced to fart jokes, fat people jokes, jokes at the expense of women; standards he himself picks up in the story. The irony is that not only is it the routine that Schecky himself picks up as a comic within this \"film\", but also exactly what Sandler's routine has turned into in real life and in the rest of his meritless filmography. The overuse of the same jokes with no payoffs and its eerie similarities to the other films in Sandler's career (despite him not being a producer/director on this) is just a testament to his consistent mediocrity. He has not progressed as an actor or comedian in any way since this disaster, and anything that he's in that happens to be good is because of the director or its premise (Punch Drunk Love for example makes a mockery/parody of Sandler's personality in a satirical way that totally works). How Sandler's career picked up after this is a total mystery. The guy is talentless. Utterly and pathetically talentless.",

Now, the film is about Stanley Marokitzadana or something and him trying to become a famous comedian on a cruise. The movie is particularly funny every noun and then and the jokes that are not hilarious are just funny and sadly some were not funny at all but it does not matter cause their funny jokes are more often. I think Adam Sandler did a very good job as the waiter and the bit where the plot gets so out of hand is just so damn funny ( last 5 minutes) and the bit where he is explaining how the earthquake cost them no money was also in the good jokes section. Also the terrorists are funny as well but sadly do not play a huge part in this funny, funny film. Overall fans of Adam Sandler will enjoy this film as it is first movie and you can really see how he became as funny as he is. I rate this film 54% for keeping me amused while being pretty hit and miss. So grab some mates and grab some beers and just watch a good movie starring Adam Sandler as his good old self. GO ADAM SANDLER AND THE WHOLE CREW IN THIS GREAT FILM YOU GUYS ROCK. Also to those out there who do not like this movie I think it is because you were expecting too much out of Adam Sandler's first movie cause in my opinion it is not as good as his other stuff but is definitely better then a lot of other comedy's out there and I even think it is funnier then Click ( not really but probably 3 quarters there. Thats my 2 cents from LacTheBod. I do not know maybe one day this will be respected as it is meant to be, as a comedy just made to introduce Adam Sandler to it's expecting audience. If you did not like this you have to high a standards as it is better then some new movies out there.",

The 97 minutes that I spent watching this movie were torturous. Turns out that this was Sandler's first starring role in a film, and after having seen it, I'm more than a little shocked that he was ever given another opportunity. I mean sure, I only spent five bucks on it, but I couldn't help but think of all the better things I could have used that fiver on. Maybe a foot-long sandwich at Subway. Perhaps I could have given it to the bell-ringing Santa that had been standing in front of the entrance, even though his breath smelled like a combination of beer and Cheetos.

Still, there's nothing wrong with that, i was expecting him to make a joke about it.So if nothing else, watch this for adam, and the 2 cuban guys.

Don't watch it expecting a very enjoyable sandler film.  watch it expecting to see what you hear adam tell you your gonna see in the first 5 minutes.to all those people who think this is just a HORRIBLE movie. . .well duh, it was MENT to be. adam tells you its gonna be.Sadly, this move is NOT listed on adam sandler's websight.  guess he's ashamed of it or something, i dunno why he would be, maybe cause of his shorts. . ..anyway, be sure to check this out, but don't watch it in a serious fashion, be light hearted. . .",

Of course the acting was mediocre, even with Billy Zane and Billy Bob, but that's what you expect from this and these actors in their early stage, so watch this from the eyes of someone getting to see these actor/comedians in their youth. It is still classic Adam Sandler, and you can see some of his facial expressions coming to life for future movies. There are a lot of slo-mo bikini shots, classic 80's, but again, what did you expect?",

Let me tell you about this god awful movie that powered on Adam Sandler's film career but was digitized after a short time.Going Overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by Sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship and fails...or so I thought. Sandler encounters babes that like History of the World Part 1 and Rebound. The babes were supposed to be engaged, but, actually, they get executed by Sawtooth, the meanest cannibal the world has ever known. Adam Sandler fared bad in Going Overboard, but fared better in Big Daddy, Billy Madison, and Jen Leone's favorite, 50 First Dates. Man, Drew Barrymore was one hot chick. Spanglish is red hot, Going Overboard ain't Dooley squat! End of file.",

The premise was a bit sketchy a young waiter on a boat wants to become a comedian and miraculously the ship comedian disappears giving Adam Sandlers character the chance to shine. Even though i was a bit unsure i decided to buy the DVD noticing that Burt Young and Billy Zane both were in it as well. After viewing \"Going Overboard\" the first thing i was surprised about was how number one nothing really happened and number two that as a whole wasn't really funny. But in all fairness this is Sandlers first feature from 1989 way before he was worldwide famous and his comedic roots hadn't developed yet at the time, also come on people this movie was made on an extreme shoestring budget so what can you really expect. I would only recommend this to movie fans who want to collect all of Adam Sandlers DVD's but don't buy it assuming this is going to be a laugh fest.",

Iknow it was a low-budget film, but that is what I liked about it.  Adam Sandler even made fun of it, stating that it wasn't a low-budget film, but that it was a no-budget film.

Billy Zane must have begged his manager to get such a juicy part. Billy Bob Thorton must have the same manager as Billy Zane to get such a movie part. After watching this movie I sat on my couch for 30 minutes just trying to comprehend on what I had just seen. I was completely and I do mean completely speechless.

The movie is about Adam being on a cruise and feels like he can do a better job as a stand up then the current guy. It just drags on and on with making it seem like your watching it for two to three hours. Pulling your teeth out might be more enjoyable then this flick. Adam, I'm so glad your movies that you make now way better. I only hope that by being involved in this movie was to learn how to better in what you do. As we can all see it clearly was. I want to say thank you and keep it up. I look forward to more.",
