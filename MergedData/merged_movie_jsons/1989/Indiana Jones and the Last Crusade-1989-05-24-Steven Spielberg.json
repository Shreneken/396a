            "content": "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) is an Action Classic adventure better film than Temple of Doom , is still the best follow up in the trilogy and clever. It is also the greatest sequel of all time. It is one of my personal favorite adventure movies of all time. I love this movie to death. I loved it as a child and I still love it. After the dark middle chapter it was time for Indy to return to form and more lighthearted fair. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was the answer. Not to mention that bringing in Bond aka Sean Connery as Indy's dad was perfect casting. Connery adds his own whit & charm along with Indy's usual counterparts who where missed in The Temple of Doom. Last Crusade also bookends the trilogy well since the artifact he is after is related to God. While \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" isn't by any means what I would consider a stellar film, it was still an enjoyable and memorable theatrical experience, and in my opinion, easily ranks as the best sequel in the series. For all its faults and shortcomings (perhaps most of all, River Phoenix' laughably terrible haircut as the young Indy), the film succeeds in hitting the key notes at the proper moments, thus drumming up enough of the right combination of story and thematic elements, action and humor to make it worthwhile. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that it still pales in comparison to the level of across-the-board excellence that was achieved in the original 1981 movie. Still though, fans of this one will definitely want to pick up this excellent release, of which, throughout the entire presentation, I only came across a handful of things I thought could possibly be improved upon technically.This is probably the best installment of the Indiana Jones series. Raiders is a spectacular introduction to Dr. Jones and his style, Temple of Doom is an awesome Action, Adventure flick! Last Crusade rights the ship again with a go-for-broke production. Everything about it is huge- Jones is saving the planet from the Nazis for the second time. The budget was in place and off went Spielberg to make an epic, successfully. The film is bookended by two of the best things to appear in any of Spielberg's output: A young Indiana \"beginning\" his archaeological career, losing his treasure- just like the opening of Raiders- and being told by the man in his trademark hat \"You lost today kid, but that doesn't mean you have to like it.\" and at the end, riding off into the sunset, literally. Such a conclusion could be seen as contrived but it works so well here. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade has lots of hand-to-hand combat, action-filled chases, and gun fights. Main characters are in near-constant peril, and one is shot point blank and almost bleeds to death. Minor characters are killed in somewhat gruesome ways, including beheading; a bad guy meets his end in a fairly disturbing scene. There's a bit of kissing/banter, and it's implied that two men have slept with the same woman. Language is mild, and there's ultimately a strong message about the importance of the father-son relationship.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a 1989 American adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg, from a story co-written by executive producer George Lucas. It is the third installment in the Indiana Jones franchise. A cult film, still one of my favorite films in the series and the last good Indiana Jones movie we didn't need another sequel after third release. There's nothing more exciting than trying to keep up with the Joneses in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Indy's Nazi enemies are back and have kidnapped his father, Professor Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery), in their effort to locate the sacred Holy Grail. Following a trail from America to Venice to the deserts of the Middle East, it's up to Indy (Harrison Ford) to save his father, save the Grail and save the day in this non-stop, action-packed adventure the whole family will treasure.The chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford makes this movie a stand out from the rest of the series. The story of their father and son relationship wrapped in the search for the holy grail is what makes this spectacular Indy movie, a more meaningful adventure. 10/10 Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",

            "content": "Indiana Jones, the man, the legend, the whip. Everyone I know has seen at least one of the Indiana Jones movies and usually Raiders of the Lost Ark is their favorite. Now I loved Raiders of the Lost Ark, I also really loved Temple of Doom even though it gets a lot of hate for it's darkness. But The Last Crusade is my favorite of the trilogy and the strongest in my opinion. For goodness's sake we have Sean Connery as Indiana's father, how could we get any better than that? I love his way of saying \"Junior!\", always gets me in a good chuckle. Harrison Ford still has that same Indy charm that swoons the ladies, the adventure that captivates the guys and takes us on an incredible journey that we'll never forget.In 1938, Indiana finally recovers the Cross and donates it to his friend Marcus Brody's museum. Indiana is later taken to the residence of wealthy businessman Walter Donovan, who informs him that his father has vanished while searching for the Holy Grail, leaving behind partial directions from an incomplete stone tablet along with his diary containing his life's work on the Grail. Indiana and Marcus travel to Venice to investigate Henry's disappearance, meeting up with his colleague Elsa Schneider. Discovering catacombs beneath the library where Henry was last seen, Indiana and Elsa find the tomb of Sir Richard, a knight of the First Crusade who is buried with a complete version of the tablet. Indiana finds his father, only to be betrayed by Elsa, who reveals that she and Donovan are working with the Nazis to find the Grail. The Nazis steal the Grail diary and capture Marcus in Iskenderun, where he was sent with pages from the diary to seek the protection of Sallah. The Joneses manage to escape the castle and follow the Nazis to Berlin, where they recover the diary from Elsa. The Joneses, Marcus and Sallah arrive to find that the Nazis are unable to pass through three \"trials\" of God. After Indy's father gets shot, he doesn't have much of a choice as to pass the trials and choose the correct cup to save his father's life.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is one of my favorite movies of all time, it's just a flawless movie that will always be timeless. My future kids will watch these movies, they're just a lot of fun. Who said archeology can't be fun? This also has one of the most exciting chase scenes of all time, Indiana is trying to rescue his father and a friend from a Nazi tank and he is on a horse, a brutal fight ensues and was just so exciting to watch. I've watched this movie since I was a little girl and I still watch it with pleasure today, even with my friends we love watching Indiana and his adventures. They're an absolute blast and if you haven't seen Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, please take the first opportunity you have to watch it, it's a great movie.10/10",

            "content": "Rating: **** out of ****My opinion of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade could be deemed slightly biased. It is the first film I ever saw in theaters and it's also the first movie I purchased on video. I even own the same, worn-down, beat-up copy (and look upon it even more fondly than the widescreen edition, for sentimental reasons, of course) (but nothing beats the pristine quality DVD). I think it's fair to say it's this movie that cemented my love of cinema, the high regard I hold for great escapism, which is sorely lacking from today's cinema; movies that should be fun now drag or bludgeon themselves with relentlessly awful scripts or MTV-style direction that turns relatively simple scenes into chaotic blurs. The Last Crusade may only be thirteen years old, but I think I can safely say they don't make them like they used to.The film stars, of course, Harrison Ford as Indy Jones, the archaeologist/adventurer who's on yet another quest, this time to find his father, who'd been searching for the Holy Grail. Said Dad is played by none other than Sean Connery, whose highly charismatic performance is quick to place this film, acting-wise, above the others in the trilogy by giving Ford a genuine acting equal (let me put it this way, he's only half a notch below Harrison Ford/Indy in charisma and appeal if that tells you anything). The rest of the film focuses on this ongoing journey between father and son (eventually joined along by Sallah and Marcus Brody), complete with amazing action and stunt sequences, clever humor, and nasty (but fun) surprises.The script, by Jeffrey Boam, takes a few cues from Raiders of the Lost Ark, but actually improves upon that story by paying more attention to characterization. The delightful opening scene (all three movies really open with a bang, don't they?); which details how young Indy got his scar, whip, hat, and fear of snakes; makes for a better prequel than Temple of Doom (and any of The Adventure of Young Indiana Jones, for that matter).The story is engrossing because there's a lot of fun clues offered towards the location of the Grail and, thus, there's a lot of engaging little discoveries (love the \"X marks the spot\" scene). I'm quite certain, like with Raiders of the Lost Ark, the plot has a few holes, but they're fairly hard to notice, and I've seen this movie quite a few times, but maybe it's just my enjoyment of the film clouding that up. Either way, it speaks volumes in favor of Spielberg's direction and the performances.Given that action and adventure is the series' selling point, you can expect the thrills and wondrous delight of discovery delivered in spades. The action scenes are terrific (and matched well with John Williams' rousing, memorable score, also the best of the trilogy), the best being a fantastic ten-minute chase sequence on board (and in) a tank, possibly the best action sequence of Spielberg's career. I also loved the motorcycle chase and the Zeppelin setpiece, where the heroes go about dispatching of two enemy fighters in unexpected, but quite hilarious, fashion. The climax, complete with frightening booby traps, is a suspenseful venture into the unknown.The Last Crusade is far more humor-oriented than its predecessors, but part of the movie's effectiveness is that it's able to deliver belly laughs without defusing the tension during the action sequences. Some of the jokes are just brilliant, including one with Indy armed with a Luger in confrontation with a trio of Nazis on board a tank that's even funnier than the swordsman scene in Raiders (well, to me, at least).The supporting cast is all-around superb; John Rhys-Davies is back as Sallah, wonderful as ever and displaying a bit more enthusiasm searching for the Grail than he did digging up the Ark of the Covenant. The late Denholm Elliot also returns as Marcus Brody, the most lovable goof of a museum curator. Alison Doody is interesting as Elsa, the blonde historian whom Indy falls for; a twist involving her character and her actions towards the climax make her not as one-dimensional as she may initially appear. Julian Glover is the best of the main Indy villains, he's far more menacing than Paul Freeman's Belloq and less over-the-top but equally enjoyable as Amrish Pruri's Mola Ram. I also enjoyed Michael Byrne's performance as the Jones hating Colonel Vogel, who relishes in torturing Indy and his father. When it comes to pure delightfully nasty villainy, Byrne is even more fun to watch than Glover.Harrison Ford delivers his best Indy performance (maybe even his best performance, period) in this particular adventure. With the addition of Connery as his father, it reveals a personal side to Indy we haven't seen before. It's his rapport with Connery that separates this film from the rest of the genre. They craft an uncannily touching, funny, and genuine bond. That, coupled with the superb action and thrills, solidifies The Last Crusade as the pinnacle of high adventure summer entertainment.",

            "content": "Indiana Jones teams up with his father to try and locate the Holy Grail. Something that the Nazis are again particularly interested in themselves.We didn't know it at the time, but every Indiana Jones fan on the planet presumed that The Last Crusade was to be the final film to feature the intrepid archaeologist. As it turned out, another film would surface in 2008, but casting that aside (as many would like to do), Last Crusade should, and is, judged as the trilogy closer it was meant to be.In 1988 Steven Spielberg was deep into bringing Rain Man to fruition, all thoughts of Indiana Jones had gone by the wayside with the harshly judged part two, Temple Of Doom. In stepped George Lucas to politely remind Spielberg that they had an agreement to make another Indiana Jones picture, Spielberg no doubt obliged and humble, passed on his Rain Man work to Barry Levinson who promptly bagged himself an Oscar for the film. It can be guessed that Spielberg was probably grouchy around this period, but he needn't have worried, because The Last Crusade provided a much needed hit for not only himself (post Empire Of The Sun), but also Lucas (Willow) and Harrison Ford (Frantic).I mention the run up to this picture because it explains a lot on why the film is pretty much a retread of Raiders Of The Lost Ark, something that some detractors find unforgivable. Yet Last Crusade is still an immensely enjoyable adventure picture, with Spielberg proving that he was still capable of a popcorn bonanza. Using the Raiders formula and moving away from the dark flourishes of Temple Of Doom, Last Crusade is actually the simplest film of the three, but still it manages, courtesy of a sparkling casting decision, to become the most entertaining of the original trilogy. Is it better than Raiders? Of course not, but it positively rips along with sparky dialogue and an agenda of cliffhanging suspense like the adventure films of yore.In comes Sean Connery as Dr Jones Senior, and its the picture's trump card, because the magnificent interplay and obvious rapport with Ford (cool as a cucumber) is there for all to see. It's this what drives the film on through the more mundane and picture filler sequences, showcasing two top wily professionals with care and consideration to their craft. The casting of Alison Doody as the main female is a poor one, and one only has to look at her subsequent career post Crusade to see she wasn't up to the task here. Bonus comes in the form of the River Phoenix prologue, Phoenix as the young Indiana paves the way for the jaunty path that Crusade takes, whilst simultaneously giving us a nice little back story from which to launch the adventure.Made for $48 million, the film went on to gross $474,171,806 Worldwide, now that's a lot of people who evidently were happy with Raiders Of The Lost Ark 2! And I gleefully count myself amongst that number. 9/10",

At least that's what director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas said at the time this film hit theaters. But now they've said there will be a fourth \"Indiana Jones\" film. I really don't know if that's a good idea, because the \"Last Crusade\" was a fitting end to a great movie series. Harrison Ford returns for his third go around as swashbuckling hero Indiana Jones, this time accompanied by Sean Connery as Indy's father, Dr. Henry Jones. These two actors work beautifully together as they fight off the Nazis in search for the Holy Grail. Two actors from \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" reprise their roles to great effect in \"Last Crusade\": Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody and John Rhys-Davies as Sallah. Alison Doody is the heroine (good or bad?); Julian Glover is the villain; River Phoenix portrays a young Indy at the beginning to see how this character really got his start. \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" not only has great characters, it also has a decent story (taking place in 1938), plus exciting action scenes and special effects. It's better than the second film \"Temple of Doom\" and comes very close to topping the first film \"Raiders\". The \"Indiana Jones\" series should stay right where it is with the \"Last Crusade\" as the finale. Unless Spielberg, Lucas, and Ford can prove us wrong and make a really good fourth film in the series, we shall see. I loved all three movies in the \"Indiana Jones\" series. If the fourth film does gets made, I hope it'll be equally as good as the first three.**** (out of four)",

            "content": "Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade was, in my opinion, the best movie of the Indiana Jones trilogy. This movie featured the same type of humor we have become accustomed to from Jones, as well as another beautiful woman (also probably the best Indy girl) and lots of great action scenes! This movie starts off with a teenage Indy (River Phoenix) which gives us a look at an event that molds his life and character as well as his relationship with his father, Henry (Sean Connery). We also learn he is a \"Junior\" and that he hates to be called that.Back as an adult, Indy's father is kidnapped and he must set out to find him. His only clues are his father's diary notes, which were mysteriously sent to him earlier that day. They lead him to Italy, where he meets the gorgeous blonde, Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), who becomes an integral part of this story.Once again, the grown up Indy (Harrison Ford) does battle with the Nazis. Apparently, Adolf Hitler is after the Holy Grail, which contains the blood of Christ. So Indiana and his father team up to get there first. Along the way, there is a great action scene where Jones fights a few Nazis on board a moving tank.Overall, as I mentioned earlier, I believe this to be the best Indiana Jones movie of the three. This action movie was good long before movie studios learned to make the great CGI and special effects. It's effects were pretty good anyways but back in 1989, things just did not look as good as they can make them today. Still, highly recommended and worth your time. 9.5/10",

            "content": "When the two greatest filmmakers in the world teamed up to create the best action movie of all time - Raiders of the Lost Ark, it seemed unlikely that they could duplicate their divinely-inspired work. After a miss with the entertaining yet forgettable Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade comes pretty close to doing just that.Film history's most profitable star Harrison Ford returns to his signature role in a performance that speaks for itself, and benefits greatly from a gallery of memorable supporting characters. That includes Sean Connery, the grandest of all modern action day movie heroes (and appropriately cast, as the spiritual father of the character is James Bond). Connery plays against that, in a performance that is different than anything he has ever done, and it works. Even so, Denholm Elliott can't seem to help stealing every scene he's in as Marcus Brody, a lifelong friend of the Jones family.This movie stands by itself in the way it deals with spirituality, and is thick with religious themes throughout, without preaching to you. This is a very difficult balance to achieve in any film, and that alone makes the film stand out as brilliant. It is more abundant with humor than the previous two films, without the characters falling into irritating self-parody. Being a sequel, this is a difficult balance to achieve as well. (Look at action sequels such as Lethal Weapon 4).This film stands among the greatest action adventures of all time. I don't know anyone who hasn't seen it, but if you haven't, don't walk to see it.

Sad, but that's how the story goes. Remember the Beta Video stores?When I was a kid, and we got our very first VCR \u2013 man, that was like the invention of television for those around my age \u2013 and I was able to save up enough money to buy two previously viewed movies. And get this: I had to actually pre-order previously viewed VCR tapes and they were incredibly $19.95 apiece!No matter; I really wanted both Lethal Weapon 2 and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. And bad.They were like gold for me. And they, along with a birthday gift of the original Batman, certainly earned their weight. I must've watched those three \u2013 my only movies \u2013 fifty times each.So, you can see: I am very familiar with Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Every inch, score number and frame. I love this movie.Later, I would contest and readily agree, Raiders of the Lost Ark is both a masterpiece and better film, but that doesn't deter on how\u0085much\u0085FUN this third installment is. And I'm not even mentioning the dreadful part two: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. In my mind, there's only Indy 1 and 3. You can even forget the (yawn) Young Indiana Jones (so-called) Adventures.Everything worked in this movie: suburb acting, hilarious and fun dialogue \u2013 mostly from the chemistry (or banter) of the two Jones's, extreme adventure, exciting action, fantastic characters, nostalgia \u2013 for fans of Raiders and great twists. And one of the best aspects is also a spoiler, \u2013 sorry, but if you haven't seen this 22-year-old epic, that's your fault \u2013 it has one of the best endings in the history of cinema: they actually ride off into the sunset. Brilliant and beautiful ending to the series!** - that is until they ruined it with the overkill: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Best advice? Think of this as the actual LAST adventure and forget that wretched sequel.Heck, I can't really pinpoint many, if any, faults or flaws in Last Crusade. Pooossssibly, the over-long opening segment with the original \"Young Indiana\" played by the late and great River Phoenix? Even that was entertaining, fun and had an awesome score track. So, technically, it's not a setback, but perhaps needed a little more editing.Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is overwhelmed at school, but is more so when his father, Henry Jones, Sr. (Sean Connery \u2013 in, Literally one of his best on-screen performances) is listed as missing. Indy is tempted with the prospect of finding the mystical Holy Grail, even though he, himself, doesn't believe it. He does set off on a mission to find his father, but we all know, he'd equally like to find this \"Lost Cup of Jesus Christ.\"He meets up with (what I grew up referring to as \"the blonde\") the beautiful and seductive dame Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody) and they quest to find daddy Jones and ward off Nazis. Not so much a spoiler, but he does rescue Henry Jones, Sr. and the race for the Grail is on between the Jones's and the Nazis.I left out a lot, but that's the basic, BASIC, premise. Seriously, if you have not seen this, or have even, see it (again, if you have) and learn to enjoy the film that frankly defines adventure. And a movie that captures the heart of the original, the atmosphere of the serials of before most of our times and how movies were really made: pre-CGI.On a related note: while some people are anti-3D, I am boarder-line anti-CGI. Sure it's a cheaper way of filmmaking, but I feel it's just that: cheap. Rarely will it be believable in my sight, for the most part it's all-but a cartoon and extremely laughable. That said, it can work\u0085sometimes. The recent 2010 Alice in Wonderland film is a perfect example of how it can really work and impress me. But, 80% of the time, it's just plain corny, distracting and again, CHEAP. My favorite action/adventures films are how they used to be made: with both inventiveness and heart. Like this one. Heck, I'll take a blue/green screen any day over a computer telling me what's \"real\" looking.But, I digress. I hesitate in calling this a masterpiece (in filmmaking, at least) but in my mind it is. And seeing that this is an opinion piece, I will go on record: it doesn't get much better than this.I remember some of the promotional shots on the late night shows from Harrison Ford, et al, that casually admitted Temple of Doom was a disaster \u2013 I AGREE \u2013 and this was a make-up movie. It sure the heck was! This was thee number one redemption movie of all time.Note to Hollywood: continue the redemption. Make movies like this, verses the CGI-laced, no-script films of the last decade or so. Remember what it's like to have this much fun in the movie going experience. I remember. I recall 1989 when this was released as my all-time favorite year in films released. Too bad, they haven't come close to '89 in 22 years.And Hollywood won't listen. I ask that you do. Support and watch movies like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Remember what it was like to have fun in the theatre, what it was like when real special-effect crews did real work on the fields and not in the office and remember what it was like to be a kid again.

He succeeded and nearly even topped the first film in sheer joy and adventure. Might as well call the two adventures even in my book. The film has amazing set pieces (the rat scene in Venice among others). What I really liked the most? The introduction of Dr. Henry Jones, Indiana's father, played beautifully by Sean Connery. Through most of the film, Harrison Ford and Connery have such a strong rapport together and their arcs intersected in the best possible way. Indiana Jones beating up Nazi thugs in Raiders was a treat. Why not have him do it again, so Nazis are our main villains once again. For a brief moment, Indiana comes face-to-face with Adolf Hitler in such a chilling sequence at a book-burning rally. Finally, I loved how they chase after the Holy Grail. As someone fascinated by this type of history (The Crusades, Holy Grail, etc), another reason is given to me to be hooked into the story. Kudos to Steven Spielberg to directing one of the best trilogies of all time (although there is obviously now a fourth). If there was no fourth film, the ending is poignant and a perfect sendoff for our hero.After the relatively mixed reaction of The Temple of Doom, Spielberg set out to make a trilogy capper that captured the spirit and tone of the original. Spielberg and producer George Lucas had some bizarre ideas such as using the Monkey King, ghosts, the Fountain of Youth, and a cannibalistic African tribe amongst other ideas. Thankfully, they ended up using more straightforward ideas such as reintroducing the Nazis and bringing Indy's father into the fold. Jeffrey Boam is the main credited screenwriter although there have been various drafts from writers such as Chris Columbus. Boam gave more credibility to the father-son story by having them lose the grail mid-film. I also liked the idea of young Indy to start the film. River Phoenix was an excellent choice to play the fedora-wearing hero in his youth. This father-son relationship is the heart of the story. Spielberg, Boam, Connery, and Ford did everything to make it work. We should also thank Connery for his suggestions because he is the one who suggest ideas for his character that stuck. As an actor who studied history, it was essentially a requirement if they wanted his services. To keep the tone they were aiming for, Spielberg brought back the bumbling Marcus Brody and Indy's sidekick, Sallah.Like the other two films, there are incredible action sequences, and the production design is fantastic. There is no scene that can top the boulder sequence from Raiders, but it does come awfully close. Even though there are no underground tombs in Venice, I actually thought there were for a second. The boat chase on the Grand Canal is fun. The rat scene made me jump. I do not mind snakes unlike Indy but rats...ughhhh! The movie boosted tourism for some places. What is known as \"The Treasury\" located in Jordan (where the Grail was housed) became a new spot for tourists. The beginning sequence was filmed in one of my favorite National Parks, Arches National Park. Also, the castle sequence with Indy and his father is another highlight. In addition to great production design and special effects, John Williams crafted another beautiful score. Hearing that theme always get me.It is 1939, and Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is back in action. The famed archaeologist is given a diary that holds clues and maps to the whereabouts of the famed Holy Grail from his father, Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery) who made a living studying the mysteries of the Grail. Indy learns from a private collector Walter Donovan (Julian Glover) that the search for the Grail disappeared along with Indy's father. Indiana and his friend Brody (Denholm Elliot) travel to Italy to find Indy's father. Once that happens, now it is a race to find the Grail before the Nazis do. If the Nazis find it, they will use its power for complete world domination. With the help of Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) and Elsa (Alison Doody), an Austrian art professor, Indy and his father must race to find the Grail with what limited clues they possess.Harrison Ford is fantastic as always. He continues his wisecracking ways...but changes his personality around his father. We even learn his real name! He has fantastic chemistry with Sean Connery who is bloody brilliant here. The Connery/Ford combo is one of my favorite father/son combos in film history. As for Alison Doody, she makes for a fine heroine. Even if she does not quite live up to Karen Allen. Better than Kate Capshaw, though. If there is a minor complaint, that would be it. Julian Glover has always been great as the villain, so does it surprise that he is great here? It is also great to have Denholm Elliot and John Rhys-Davies back in the fold.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was so much fun. It has a fun, adventurous spirit just like Raiders of the Lost Ark. If this would have been the finale, it would have been the perfect end. Riding off into the sunset. The action, special effects, and production design are all stunning. I am glad they brought back Nazis because that Hitler sequence was so chilling. And who doesn't like the Nazis getting their butts kicked. Spielberg has always been the king of movie magic. The Last Crusade is just one of those examples.My Grade: A+",

            "content": "\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" was the third and final instalment in the original Indiana Jones trilogy. Whereas \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" was a prequel to \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", \"Last Crusade\" is a true sequel. Apart from an opening scene relating an adventure of the teenage Indy as a Boy Scout in 1912, the action takes place in 1938, two years after \"Raiders\". (In this opening scene we learn how the hero got his nickname; Indiana is not, as I had always assumed, his home state, but a name borrowed from his pet dog).Whereas \"Raiders\" was a great commercial and critical success, \"Temple of Doom\" received considerable criticism, both on account of its dark, gloomy atmosphere and its racist treatment of Indian characters. Steven Spielberg, therefore, was determined to make the third film lighter in tone, closer in spirit to \"Raiders\". Once again the villains are the Nazis, once again the plot involves the search for a legendary relic with mystical powers (in this case the Holy Grail which caused such excitement among King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table) and once again much of the action takes place in the Middle East. (This must be the only Hollywood film ever to be set- ostensibly- in the short-lived Republic of Hatay, formerly part of French Syria and today part of southern Turkey, which enjoyed a brief independence for several months in 1938/9. Most of the \"Hatay\" scenes, however, were shot in Spain, with the ruins of Petra, actually in Jordan, standing in for the temple in which the Grail is housed).The film also introduces us to Indy's father, Henry Jones, Sr. The James Bond films were undoubtedly one of the inspirations for this franchise, and it was possibly in their homage that Sean Connery was cast as the elder Jones, even though he is only twelve years older than Harrison Ford. (That speedboat chase along the Venetian canals also seems to be homage to Bond). Like his son, Henry senior is an academic archaeologist and has gone missing while seeking the Holy Grail. Indy believes that his father is in danger and sets out to find him, a quest that will take him to Venice, Germany and ultimately Hatay. The main female character is Henry's colleague, Dr. Elsa Schneider, a glamorous Austrian blonde whose loyalties are ambiguous.There is more stress on character development here than in other episodes of the franchise, with emphasis being placed on the father-son relationship. The film is not just about the search for the physical Holy Grail. Even in the Arthurian legend the Grail was as much a symbol as a physical object, and today the phrase \"holy grail\" is used metaphorically for anything which is desirable and much sought-after. The film is also about Indiana's search for his lost father and their efforts to re-establish a relationship which in the past has often been strained- the story's metaphorical Holy Grail. Ford and Connery are both good at bringing out this aspect of the story. There are also good contributions from Denholm Elliott as Indiana's bumbling colleague Marcus Brody and Alison Doody as the treacherous, seductively sinister Elsa.After the awful \"Temple of Doom\", \"Last Crusade\" represents a welcome return to form, both for Spielberg and for Ford, who seemed ill at ease in the earlier film but here is back to his old ebullient self. The film contains a better balance of suspense and humour than did its predecessor, much of the humour being at the expense of the hapless Marcus. There are some excellent action scenes, such as the train sequence in the opening scene, the escape from the Zeppelin and the tank chase though the desert. \"Last Crusade\" is a very enjoyable adventure film in the same tradition as \"Raiders\". 7/10",

            "content": "Summer 1989. I was 8 years old. I only managed 2 movies that summer, one being Ghostbusters 2 (which blew my eager young mind at the time) and Last Crusade (which also blew my mind). I don't think I could have asked for two bigger blockbusters to choose from. Having been a rabid child fan of Raiders and Temple of Doom all things Indy were fresh in my mind and even as an 8-year-old I truly 'got' Last Crusade.Set 2 years after Raiders, and 3 years after Temple of Doom, Last Crusade opens with a flashback to Indy's youth and an aggravating cameo by River Phoenix in the role. His anachronistic hair, androgynous physiognomy, and that fact that he looks absolutely nothing like Harrison Ford take me out of the film every time, and spoils the long opening scene for me. The opening does nothing apart from establish all of Indy's trademarks (the hat, the whip, the scar, the fear of snakes), which he apparently all got within five minutes. Luckily the film soon jumps forward to 1938 and the opening quickly is forgotten about as shady antique collector Walter Donovan encourages Indy to go after the Holy Grail.With Der Fuhrer also after the sacred chalice Indy must once again face off against the despicable Nazis, rescue his bumbling father (Sean Connery, having the time of his life), and keep one step ahead of Donovan with Sallah and Brody tagging along.There is loads of inventive, exciting action in many exotic, breath-taking locations and all of it is immaculately photographed by Douglas Slocombe in lovely anamorphic Panavision. Even with today's many advancements in movie camera technology you'll rarely see a film as beautifully photographed as this. All very high-key, mind you, the polar opposite of the dark, subterranean Temple of Doom.Now, herein lies my only gripe with Last Crusade (other than River Phoenix) is the fact that it's just too light-hearted. Spielberg expressed regret over the fact that he made Temple of Doom very dark and mean-spirited (which I don't agree with as it is my personal favorite) so he compensated by making Last Crusade more cheerful and bright. It's not an annoying shift in tone, but it could have been balanced out with a bit more blood and gore.Last Crusade makes the perfect end to the real Indiana Jones trilogy. Spielberg really should have left it as our hero, his dad, and his two sidekicks rode off into the sunset. How can you top that? How can you come back from that? But 19 years later he tarnished many reputations and spoiled many memories with the deeply, DEEPLY misjudged Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.It was an amazing film to see as a child, and it's a shame that kids these days are not exposed to anything as good. If you can turn a blind eye to River Phoenix you will surely have a great time with Last Crusade. It's not the Snake Car on the train he ought to worry about, it's the Viper Room on Sunset Boulevard.",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the third installment in the Indiana Jones franchise. The movie takes place after Raiders of the Lost Ark and concerns Indiana Jones as he looks for the holy grail.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a fantastic third entry into the Indiana Jones trilogy. The third entry combines action, adventure, and surprisingly comedy in one tight and focused movie. Much of the comedy is owed to Sean Connery playing Indiana Jones' father. This entry is as good if not better than Raiders of the Lost Ark. It is entirely understandable to see why some audiences may prefer Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade over Raiders of the Lost Ark. This is a movie that edges more towards comedic action-adventure.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade does not skimp on the action scenes. This is a movie that took the phenomenal white knuckle action in the previous two movies to different settings. The action set pieces in this movie are absolutely sublime in their execution. It is as if the earlier entries in the franchise were more for the experience in setting up what the audience would like in this movie. The action setup combined to form a blend of busting comedy and intense action that is a wonder to behold.The villains share the same problem as in Raiders of the Lost Ark. The villains are not all that threatening to Indiana Jones and are able to be overcome easily. This acto of being overcome is more bearable than in Raiders of the Lost Ark or Temple of Doom as it is more comical. The comedy from Indiana Jones overcoming the antagonistic political party is phenomenal. A lot of this is owed to Sean Connery's performance as Indiana Jones' father. He comes up with many unique solutions in their predicaments that work in their favor. It was hilarious watching Sean Connery overcome the evil villains through trickery. Sean Connery is a gem in this movie.I highly recommend \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" directed by Steven Spielberg.Grade: A.",

In the beginning we get to see young Indy (River Phoenix) and where he got his fear of snakes, etc., and we meet his father, Henry Jones (Sean Connery), a brilliant professor.In this story, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) leaves his teaching job to again save the world from the Nazis. They have kidnapped Indy's father for his diary. The Nazis seek nothing less than the Holy Grail, for which Henry Jones has maps and notations in his diary which can lead to it. The Holy Grail here is a chalice used by Jesus at the Last Supper, received by Joseph of Arimathea and said to possess miraculous powers. Joseph used the Grail to catch Christ's blood while interring him. It's up to Indy to free his father.Directed by Steven Spielberg, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade takes the audience on a thrilling journey to Venice, Austria, Germany and remote locations. The film never lets up its fast pace and around every corner, there's a special effect, or funny dialogue, or a brilliant escape.The great cast also includes Julian Glover, John Rhys-Davies, Denholm Elliott, and Alison Doody.",

The film is followed by the TV series ,also produced by George Lucas : \u00a8The young Indiana Jones\u00a8 with Sean Patrick Flannery. The motion picture was splendidly directed by Steven Spielberg , being his favorite of the \"Indiana Jones\" films , and it is on record as saying he directed the pic for two reasons: To fulfill a three-picture obligation he had made with George Lucas, and, and to atone for the criticism that he received for the previous installment, Indiana Jones and the temple of Doom (1984). It obtained some Academy Awards, secondary Oscars for editing and sound effects, very well deserved although I miss didn't achieve more.

This is the glass in which the Christ would have drank during the last meal with his apostles. His father assists him in his investigations because he's got precious information about the Graal. So, a long trip begins and will lead our two heroes from Venice to the Middle East in passing by Berlin. You can guess it, this trip has got its rough patches (otherwise the movie would appear devoid of interest). Indeed, the Nazis wish to discover the Graal too because it would make them powerful even dangerous.Steven Spielberg designed his movie like a fascinating treasure hunt and he had the good idea by bringing Sean Connery. Thanks to his presence, the movie's got a certain humor (perhaps a little too convenient but the result works) and allows to lighten the movie.\"Indiana Jones and the last crusade\" is also a good surprise because it wipes out the unhappy memory of the previous movie: \"Indiana Jones and the temple of doom\". I found it too horrendous, bloody and even annoying due to Kate Capshaw. Here, to film Indiana Jones' incredible adventures, Spielberg adopted a dramatic and especially efficient film-making. He also avoids all that could make the movie fall in the faults quoted in the second movie. Moreover, there aren't any injury times, the rhythm is skilfully sustained (particularly during the pursuits) and it's better this way because the result is very convincing. Obviously, the movie doesn't go without a few unlikelinesses.Spielberg also brilliantly used the good old recipes for the adventure film: weird and exotic sceneries, the struggle between good and evil, the magic object that possesses supernatural powers etc...The only criticism I have to make of Spielberg is that the screenplay is perhaps well boosted but it doesn't also succeed in hiding a certain manicheism: the Nazis wish to get rid of Jones and his father and to discover the Graal would help them to satisfy their strength.An adventure movie entertaining enough to sustain the interest and rather well performed.

There is a great variety of action, they manage to fit in horseback, train, car, airplane, boat, motorcycle and tank action scenes. All of these scenes are done at the very top of their class.All the main cast work off of each other perfectly, and there is fantastic chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford as the father/son duo at the core of this film. The real predecessor to Indiana Jones is James Bond, so it makes sense that Sean Connery would play the father of Indiana Jones. But beyond stunt casting, Sean Connery's Henry Jones is a delight, and is memorable in every scene he is in.This film also blends together action and comedy perfectly. It never clashes with the tone and always allows the serious moments to sink in. But when they do a joke, it is legitimately a very funny joke.And how I can go without mentioning the music? John Williams delivers some of the best music of his career in this entry. The music compliments what is going on on screen so well, you could picture the scenes in your mind just through listening through the soundtrack.Where some may prefer \"Raiders of the Lost Arc\" for its originality and grit, I prefer \"Last Crusade\" for its refining and perfecting everything the series had set up. The ending of this film is also just more satisfying and exciting than the ending of \"Raiders\". The Holy Grail is the best maguffin of the series, and possibly of all time. There is something inherently legendary about people questing to find the Holy Grail.If you haven't seen this film: WATCH IT.

            "content": "After two successful big-budget starring vehicles, we finally get an origin story for Indiana Jones. Of course, that's largely to facilitate the addition of a new supporting character (Sean Connery in a wonderful casting as Indy's long lost father, who we'll get to in just a moment) but that extra layer of nostalgia, wrapped around a property that's deeply nostalgic in the first place, manages to avoid numerous pitfalls and serve as an effective prologue. River Phoenix performs especially well as the young Jones, expertly wearing Harrison Ford's mannerisms throughout the long callback, and somewhere along the way we get a worthwhile genesis for the grown-up version's affinity for leather jackets and fedoras.Once the story jumps ahead to a more familiar era (if not precisely the present), it's full speed ahead on the hunt for the mythical holy grail, a lifelong obsession for the father and recent fixation of the third reich. Soon reunited, both Jones boys dance through precarious situations and near-misses in the history books, a full battalion of Nazi soldiers nipping at their heels, before drawing close to the prize. Ford and Connery are dynamic together, boiling down a complicated father-son relationship to a series of glares, grins and grunts. They alternate between bickering testily and slapping each other on the back in camaraderie, and I honestly can't say which makes for a more entertaining watch. There's depth, too, a stinging blend of long-simmering resentment and earnest care for one another, which often bubbles up just in time to enhance the plot's heaviest moments.Naturally, it simply wouldn't be an Indiana Jones movie without big action sets (in which the series somehow manages to one-up itself yet again) or boatloads of witty retorts and punchy one-liners, and those two essential elements combine to give the film a loose, fun-loving quality without compromising any of the more serious moments. All this without going too far over the top, as we saw more than once in the mildly underwhelming Temple of Doom and borderline-disastrous Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. It's well-written and purposeful, successfully intense and humorous, an in-the-wheelhouse serial-styled adventure that spans several continents before confronting superstition and cracking several dusty, life-threatening riddles on the path to a biblical treasure. Indy probably should've left well-enough alone, because this chapter is essentially impossible to top.",

As it should be, it fixes most of the problems with it's predecessors, and enhances on the stuff that made that film work.There really isn't that much wrong with the movie, at it's worst moments it can be a little boring. But I also get confused as to what the movie is trying to do with with Dr. Shnieder. Spoiler Alert, but it turns out she's a Nazi, but then she's crying at the book burning, then she's clearly evil again, then she's good, then evil, by the end I wasn't sure if I was supposed to like her or not.The best part about this movie are the scenes between Indy and his dad. Harrison Ford and Sean Connery are downright hilarious at times, and have great chemistry, I actually believed that they were father and son. The action scenes are fantastic, and unlike Raiders the pacing is perfect, a perfect blend of action, comedy, drama, and adventure. Most of the special effects have held up pretty well, sure some stuff is obvious green screen but most of it's not noticeable. The villains are good, not quite as good as the ones from Raiders, but very threatening. The adventure element is great, it's sort of a mystery as well as a treasure hunt. And River Phoenix looks exactly like a young Harrison Ford.Despite not being a hardcore Indiana Jones fan, I say Last Crusade is one of the best adventure movies ever made. It's funny, exiting, has some great characters, and is very well written and directed.",

The film is funnier, classier and far more laid back than the other two woody story lines, mostly because of the introduction of the excellent Sean Connery as Indy's eccentric father. Spielberg and Lucas get back on track after their off the rails first sequel in which to many peoples' horror had none of the Nazis or characters that made Raiders so unique, however, what Spielberg does to make this film a classic is the use of historical data with the swashbuckling storyline of adventure and action.

Character development is nicely done, even giving another edge to the title character. The chemistry between Connery and Ford proves to be a highlight of the film, crafting a solid emotional depth that is furthered by the comedic moments between the two. Although, the overall hilarity is mixed, between forcing plot conveniences for laughs and at times middling dialogue. The supporting cast could have been slightly more developed, but ultimately serves their purpose, some even in their limited screen time proving impactful to the story's progression. Motivations are mostly clear, too. This makes the resolution largely satisfactory, providing fitting conclusions to each character. The arcs of the protagonists are admirably written, as well. Relating the film to various historical events and people actually works, generating a more thrilling watch for the audience. The writing is largely grounded in reality, focusing on exciting chase sequences and other action pieces that leaves the protagonists worse off than before. This all builds to create tension for the characters to overcome. Although, the opening scene could have been written somewhat better, it answering questions that did not necessarily need to be. The CGI in a few scenes take away from the experience, but practical effects work well for the production. Williams' score, and the sound, amazingly aids the feature's development, moving each scene along with a perfect background. Altogether, this feature delivers a fantastic and adventurous addition to the Indiana Jones lore.",

Well he wasn't just searching for the Holy Grail.A mysterious millionaire who's been a benefactor of archeology played by Julian Glover has hired the senior Henry Jones, who's always been a Grail seeker to look for it. But he's turned up quite missing and it's up to Harrison Ford to find his father.In an inspired piece of casting Sean Connery plays the senior Doctor Jones and the chemistry between Ford and Connery is fine. Connery is so good in the part that he makes you forget that it's usually Connery who gets to do the action stuff. Ford of course bares the burden of it while rescuing Dad from the clutches of the Nazis. They too are in pursuit of the Holy Grail. I guess if they couldn't get the Ark of the Covenant, they'll settle for the Grail. They've got a lovely female scientist in the person of Alison Doody in on the hunt.While I was watching Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade, the thought struck me that this was also the plot of Abbott and Costello Meet The Mummy. Of course with a budget a gazillion times more. But in that film Bud and Lou are in pursuit of Klaris the Mummy, Marie Windsor and a couple of henchmen are also after it, and so are the followers of Klaris led by Richard Deacon intent from not letting the secret out. Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade also has a group of people who know the secret of the Holy Grail, where it is, and they're not letting ANYONE remotely near it.Indiana Jones regulars like John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliott are also here and I also like the performance of 81 year old Robert Eddison in his next to last film as the Grail Knight. His is an astounding story and the last shot of him is for me the most memorable moment of the film.The first Indiana Jones film came out at the beginning of the Eighties and it's fitting and proper that this film came out as that decade came to a close. It's a worthy successor and in some ways superior to the first two films and a grand show.",

From the very beginning to the end it's hard to keep your eyes of the screen following these outrageous adventures and that's the allure of this series.  This film actually tried to put some serious spiritiual overtones into the storyline by searching for the Holy Grail(the cup that Jesus drank from at the last supper) and the myth that it would give everlasting life to those who drank from it.  There are the usual puzzles and hoops that Indiana has to go through to finish this journey(which make no sense from a realistic perspective), but it's obvious from the very beginning that we're watching an un-realistic hero in a movie and that's okay.

Indy was just as good an opportunity for him, though, and who better to cast as Indy's father than (the original) James Bond himself? It's actually through the casting choice of Sean Connery that this third instalment of Indy's adventures really takes flight and silences the critics of \"The Temple Of Doom\". In his third outing, Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) goes in search of his father, Prof. Henry Jones Sr (Sean Connery) who mysteriously disappeared while searching for the Holy Grail. Once again, though, the Nazi's are also in tow. After losing on the Ark of the Covenant, they too want to get their hands on the Cup of Christ. By the time of this films release everybody was fully aware of Indiana Jones. With only two films under his fedora, every woman wanted him and every man wanted to be him; Indy had already become an icon of American cinema. With a fond familiarity, people welcomed him into their homes and that's the very reason why the opening of this third instalment is such a joy. It's depiction of Indy in his youth is wonderful addition to his backstory and the late great River Phoenix does an excellent job in capturing Ford's mannerisms. We learn of his use of the whip and the resulting scar on his chin. We also get an insight into the procurement of his famous fedora and how his unusual name of \"Indiana\" originated from the family dog... (It was actually George Lucas' dog that was named Indiana and it also served as the inspiration for Chewbacca in \"Star Wars\"). After being heavily criticised for his dark tone in \"Temple of Doom\", Spielberg finds his lighter side again and delivers the funniest and most gleefully entertaining of Indy's adventures. The likes of Denholm Elliott and John Rhys Davies return from Raiders with more fleshed out comical roles but, as mentioned, it's the great interplay between Ford and Connery that's the biggest draw to here. The chemistry between them anchors a poignant family adventure while providing numerous father/son comedic moments. Like the previous two, though, there's no shortest of nail-biting action as World War II is on the brink and the Nazi's are once again Indy's foes and gives Spielberg another chance to put the Third Reich to the test. \"Schindler's List\" and \"Saving Private Ryan\" are obviously his more personal films on the subject but with Indy he gets the chance to have fun with them again, leaving this third instalment with more in common with \"Raiders\" as well as honing in on the biblical aspects of the story. Out goes the Ark and in comes the coveted Holy Grail and while the fourth film in the franchise - \"The Kingdom Of The Crystal\" - explores a misjudged science-fiction element, it confirms that Indy's adventures are better left in the paths of the religious or the occult.",

Basically, Indiana Jones has to track down his missing father and find the Holy Grail before the Nazis do. I think this movie takes the fantastic pacing and plot of the previous two movies, perfects them, and adds a whole bunch of improvements to the dialogue and scenery. The action isn't quite as fast-paced as Temple of Doom, but it's faster than Raiders. The movie earns its slower scenes of emotional connection - especially between indiana and his father. They feel like a moment of breath-catching between the tension. I also felt the dialogue was less quippy than in previous entries. Not every line felt like it was hammering me over the head with exposition, and there were some clever/funny ones that took a moment of thinking to get (like when his dad said, \"She talks in her sleep,\" or when Indiana said, \"No Ticket\"). I also think this movie gets around a lot more than the other two. Raiders stays in the Ark excavation for about \u00bd the movie, and Temple of Doom takes place almost entirely in the temple. This movie goes from America, to Venice, to Scotland, to Germany, to Petra, and doesn't spend too much time in any one spot. It never felt like there were scenes being reused, and the chases/action felt like they took place across a broader space. Overall, this will always be me (and I think my dad's) favorite jones flick.",

            "content": "How often does a third entry to an American produced English language franchise, often worked to spin money irregardless of the critical consensus, sag and just generally disappoint? It is, in that case, a great credit to the team behind this, the third Indiana Jones film of 1989 entitled \"The Last Crusade\", and the fact they done what they've done in creating something as fun and as refreshing as what we've got. We've all been here before, what with the then-latest hijinks preceded by something like four hours of romping; globe trotting; intermittent Nazi-thwarting period-set archaeological causality, but Spielberg doesn't just tread ground: he offers fresh character dynamics; addresses some rather personal issues that affect those caught up in the film's adventure and does his utmost to include action sequences that are every bit as exciting as what preceded them without ever necessarily mirroring them. Where other franchises have in the past faltered through repetition by this stage, Spielberg's film offers fresh wit and flair towards what is essentially the same theme park ride gone again.After the grim fatuity of 1984's Temple of Doom, The Last Crusade slots into a more carefree and relaxed approach to the \"Jones\" material by initially harking back to the man's youth for the opening in a dusty 1912 Utah. In doing so, the messy and misjudged series of bleak horror-shows that was the second entry are somewhat banished and there is this sense of the franchise thus reverting back to all the fun and frolics imbued within that of Raiders of the Lost Ark. The film makes a point to get across the tenaciousness and professionalism of Jones, covering the very first time the character happened upon the need for such characteristics with a delightful array of episodes set aboard a freight train hoarding varying circus acts. He looses a piece of treasure in '12, but gets it back again aboard a large ship on stormy waters in '38 - establishing his skills in combat in the process and how he doesn't necessarily let a loose end pass him by: he's willing to go to the ends of the Earth, it seems, if it means getting that 'just' cause settled.Back home in the American present, life as a university lecturer is draining and the students are demanding. He stands in his class room understating his profession, telling his class that the majority of the pastime is the reading of books and that romanticism has no place in the subject, citing that \"X never, ever marks the spot\". After a series of loosely connected events, Jones is bumped back onto the track spawning adventure and danger thus essentially allowing him to undertake a quest which will go some way to quell these negative emotions through which he expresses about his living. In wanting to get away from his students, there is an opportunity to rekindle that 'spark' and this lies with taking up the challenge to go after The Holy Grail, within which the blood of Chirst was captured as he lay there on the cross at his crucifixion: a goal outlined to him by American Walter Donovan (Glover). The decision teeters over from being a professional one to a personal one when it's revealed his father, Sean Connery's Henry, was swiped by some rivals gunning for the Grail given his credentials in the Grail's makeup and ancient history.Things begin in Venice where splashes of exposition and a good boat chase give way to some suspicions about who's on whose side when elegant German Elsa Schneider (Doody) pops up and seems very keen to guide Indiana through the initial mire. Around about this time, we're provided with a trademark series 'bit' involving rats and human-beings in a tight, centuries old underground place one cannot escape from. We've had bugs; spiders and snakes in the previous films: rats ought to do it this time. Charging across Europe to Austria, father Henry joins the quest and makes for what is probably the best sidekick so far; blowing the likes of the previous entry's Capshaw character and Short Round out of the water and probably topping Allen's from the first. Throughout, the Jones' aren't really on speaking terms and both Ford and Connery bounce off one another really well as these two scholars of archaeology acting as one another's foils: Henry being a man of a more refined and old fashioned sort therein the pastime but clashing head on with Indiana's serial-action hero approach to things.Fleeting substance between the two of them begins in the form of a brief moment on an airship when some truths from years ago rear up, and how Henry was seemingly more in love with his finding of the grail than of his own family. Spielberg's insistence on shooting Connery in the way that he does during the 1912 prologue goes some way to emphasise his anonymity in Indiana's life at that specific time; and without wanting to give anything away, the key denouement in their relationship happens much later on when Henry is forced into uttering the words \"let it go....\" at a crucial time when the decision between putting family before what has since been revealed as a pipe dream plays out. The film is a winner, a franchise entry that sticks in the mind thanks largely to its central pairing; its humour; its action sequences and its off-piste scenes such as the one at a Nazi rally when a certain man's autograph is captured. In a sense, this is probably better than Raiders; the film cracks along at the same sort of pace but there just seems to be more stuff going on here with the capability of leaving a big grin on your face and not have you feel too bad about it. Where Spielberg has garnered praise in the past for his romping, B-movie inclined entertainments, he deserves a little more with this effort.",

The Nazis, the search for a mystical religious artifact, Denholm Elliott and John Rhys Davies.The film starts with a sequence when Indy as a kid. This was an appetiser for Lucas's idea of the Young Indiana Jones adventures.The addition of Sean Connery as Indy's father leads to some of the best comic films in the moment, with also some literate moments, plenty of action and very nifty special effects.It is a Saturday afternoon at the movies spectacular.",

            "content": "Many consider The Last Crusade to be the best in the series. And many attribute Sir Sean Connery's performance as the staunch and proper Dr. Henry Jones Sr. as the turning point in the series and really makes it terrific. I have a slightly different take on both of those aspects. The Last Crusade is still a worthy part of the series and definitely is not \"worse\" than any of the others. I just don't believe it's any better either. In fact for me it kind of steered away from the core idea of Indiana Jones bring a gritty action adventure. Yes the film has action and adventure but also feels a little Hollywood with some smart comedy, one liners, bigger cast, bigger budget, and less historical viewpoint despite the idea behind the film. A lot of the film is Indiana rescuing his father from the Nazi's which is a completely different take on the series and a classic moment is Hitler himself signing Indy's book in Berlin. While I do think Sean Connery being added to the cast was a great decision I also think his character and therefore him was overused. It was like they were trying really hard to breath new life into the series and I don't think it needed it. It seemed to leave behind the homage to the 40's serials, and the campiness in exchange for big budget spectacles.Harrison Ford returns as Indiana Jones and as always is terrific as the hero to end all heroes. I think in The Last Crusade his portrayal is a little more sarcastic and humorous and doesn't really get as much opportunity to show off that rugged side that we have came to know and love. But the film had a different tone and Ford adapted Indy to fit that and still created the amazing character. Sir Sean Connery joins the cast as Indy's father and really did a terrific job. He was the polar opposite to Ford's Indiana Jones and yet they had this similar quality that made their roles believable. They have terrific chemistry together and Connery just fit into the cast perfectly. Alison Doody is the latest in Jones' love interests and she also kind of doubles as a villain but a sympathetic villain. She's also far more sultry and seductive than previous heroines from the series. River Phoenix also deserves honorable mention as he portrays the Young Indy and gives us a bit of history on the character in the beginning of the film which is one of the great moments in The Last Crusade. Phoenix is brilliant as young Indy and when grabs that cross and reaches for the ladder and flashes a smirk at the camera...it is a pinpoint accurate smirk that Harrison Ford is renowned for. That alone makes Phoenix a great performer in the film.The Last Crusade is a terrific installment in the series. I mean you have some really key moments like the history of Indy in the opening, and meeting Hitler and the entire creation of his father as a character played by Connery, the tank battle towards the cliff...I mean the film is still a classic and important part of the Indiana Jones series but I still didn't feel like it quite felt the same as the previous two Indiana Jones films. Steven Spielberg returned to the helm for this third film and you can still see his style and amazing directing skills but the film was still different and maybe they were aiming for something a little different. If anything Indiana Jones could be described as resilient and adaptive and this shows a different kind of adventure story set against the back drop of World War II and Nazi occupation but still has this medieval ancient story close behind. Regardless you have to see the film...many consider it the best, I consider it my least favorite but that's like saying I prefer Chocolate cake to Apple Pie or brownies...they are all delicious!! 8/10",

            "content": "In 1981, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg astonished the cinema-going world with the brilliant rip-roaring adventure of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' featuring Harrison Ford as the rugged, handsome, whip-cracking archaeologist Indiana Jones. A phenomenal critical and box-office success, the film inevitably resulted in the production of sequels, which, happily, did not diminish greatly in quality. 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' was released in 1986, to a rather more mixed reception, but the noticeably darker overtones and awe-inspiring effects-driven action sequences nonetheless make it one of cinema's supreme adventures. The third film in the series, 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' was released in 1989, partially as Spielberg's \"atonement\" for the perceived faults in his previous instalment.This one, superficially a rough retread of the original film, is my personal favourite of the lot, in no small part to Sean Connery's inspired casting as Professor Henry Jones. The story opens with a prologue from Indiana Jones' childhood, as a boy scout in Utah in 1912. After stumbling upon a group of grave robbers, young Indiana (played with gusto by River Phoenix, who tragically died of a drug overdose in 1993 at the brink of a successful career) steals the valuable Cross of Coronado, with the intention of presenting it to a museum. As he scrambles desperately across the carriages of a moving circus train, in flight from his experienced pursuers, we come to witness the origin of some of the hero's trademarks: the fear of snakes, the bull-whip and, of course, the fedora hat.Returning to 1938, we find Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) as the clean-shaven, tweed-wearing professor at a New England college, lecturing to his students about the lack of adventure in the field of archeology (\"X never ever marks the spot\"). Following the disappearance of his father, respected archaeologist Prof. Henry Jones (Sean Connery), Indiana strikes off across the world in search of him, unwittingly throwing himself into a race to discover the Holy Grail, the sacred cup used by Jesus Christ at the Last Supper. However, to make matters worse, Indiana finds that his old enemies \u0096 the Nazis \u0096 have also launched a frantic bid to acquire the Grail. Aided by museum curator Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) and beautiful Austrian historian Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), Indiana must rescue his father, beat the bad guys and uncover the ultimate archaeological treasure.'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' was, once again, directed by Steven Spielberg, working off a story by George Lucas and Menno Meyjes, and a screenplay from Jeffrey Boam. What ultimately makes the film such an enjoyable ride is its fantastic sense of humour, and Connery's character delivers a large portion of the comedy, whether he is smashing his son over the head with a fake Ming Vase, setting the floor alight or blasting away the tail of his own plane with a machine gun (before blaming it on the Nazis). Ford and Connery have their own share of playful father-son banter, which becomes particularly farcical when it is revealed that they have both slept with the same woman (a favourite piece of dialogue: \"I'm as human as the next man\"; \"I was the next man!\"). Denholm Elliott is also highly entertaining as Marcus Brody, who, despite Indiana's great respect for him, is so hopelessly inept that he \"once got lost in his own museum.\"The film, just like its predecessors, is one long string of action sequences, the centrepiece in this one taking place on and around a heavily-armoured Nazi tank. Clever, witty and impeccably acted, 'Indiana Jones' was and remains one of the most entertaining motion pictures ever produced, and a flawless addition to an excellent trilogy. Bring on the fourth instalment!",

            "content": "Of all the franchises in the history of film-making, not a single one boasts a better third film than The Last Crusade. Of all the sequels in this Earth, very few can quite measure up to The Last Crusade. This film set and raised the bar for all adventures following it\u2014a bar that not a single film has yet reached. Indiana Jones becomes a movie legend with the third installment. This movie has it all: action, comedy, adventure, mystery, horror, romance, and a perfect way to end a nearly-flawless trilogy. The Last Crusade is not only an amazing sequel, but ranks in my list as one of the greatest films of all-time. Without exaggeration, this movie fires on all cylinders, hits all the targets without question, and quite frankly certifies Steven Spielberg as easily one of the greatest directors in the last quarter century.It has all the elements of an incredible motion picture: likable characters, quality acting, amazing action set pieces, superb stuntwork, amazing direction, clever and deep writing, a perfect musical score (John Williams), nice cinematography, and great pacing. This movie is underrated because it's never quite mentioned in the same breath as other Spielberg classics like E.T., Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jurassic Park, Jaws, and Saving Private Ryan. Last Crusade did a beautiful job wrapping up the trilogy by dwelling into Indy's past, and tying him to his father that long-eluded him.In The Last Crusade, we find Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) once again traveling overseas in search of the Holy Grail, a relic that for hundreds of years has eluded the most stubborn of archeologists. Along this journey, he also sets out to find and reconnect with his father. This adventure takes him through Italy, Austria, and Hatay. He also encounters Nazis, massive rats, under-the-radar religious cults, a man that is centuries old, and even runs into Hitler himself. Jeffery Boem writes the script of his life as he weaves a clever tale that contains many religious and family undertones underneath the massive adventure. This film was much lighter in tone than the second installment, and covers much more ground as well.Harrison Ford IS Indiana Jones, it honestly is hard to imagine anyone else fill the role. While River Phoenix does a swell job portraying his younger self, this is Ford's film for the running. Equally as impressive is Sean Connery has Indy's father. The two share a delightful mix of tension, awkwardness, and humor as they try to put up with each other's antics and methods of survival. All the other small roles were done exceptionally well, with special kudos to Denholm Elliot as the hilarious Marcus Brody. In James Bond fashion, we have a different leading lady for the third time in the franchise, and Alison Doody does a great job combining feminine toughness with a bit of vulnerability.Steven Spielberg runs this show and runs it perfectly. All the action set pieces were crafted and executed beautifully, with the best ones being the opening train chase and the epic showdown on the desert involving the German military tank. On both scenes mentioned above we see some of the best stuntwork in the history of film, especially with Indy jumping to a moving tank on horseback. Name a stunt from recent years to top that one. And whenever action and adventure isn't happening, Spielberg keeps the tension and suspense high, even when the two Indys go at it in humorous fashion. The scene when Indy is in a Nazi rally is one of the more tense moments you'll ever see, with the stakes being absolutely high and the result potentially chaotic and disastrous.What I dislike most about movies nowadays is that there is way too much reliance on special effects and CGI. While it does create shots and images that you couldn't imitate without computers, it also cheapens the look of the film and prevents it from ever becoming even remotely realistic. With The Last Crusade, the only reliance on special effects came in the final sequence, with the first two acts focusing on stuntwork, massive sets, and clever camera tricks. This prevents Indy's third outing from ever being over-the-top, and resembles classic adventures you would find in old-old school comic books. That's what Indiana Jones is, a down-to-earth comic book hero always on a quest for adventure, history, relics, and answers. To this day he remains one of the coolest creations for cinema in history. His name is now synonymous with adventure, peril, and quality film-making. It is such a shame the franchise didn't end on the now iconic final shot because of the extremely disappointing fourth installment. The fourth just didn't have the grit, humor, quality adventure, and delightful subtle religious weight of this film and the original.Bottom Line: One of the greatest films of all-time and by far the best movie of 1989 (highlighted by big summer flicks like The Abyss, Ghostbusters II, Batman, and Lethal Weapon 2), The Last Crusade overpowers the second installment by leagues and is right underneath the original as some of the best adventure/action film-making you'll ever see. There honestly isn't a single major flaw in here, as everything from the directing to the exceptional musical score was done beautifully. While Spielberg and Lucas have taken a different approach to film-making in this decade and leading up to the next, there is no denying what a powerful force they were in terms of success and quality back in the 80s. If you enjoy movies, it is your duty to watch this one and enjoy its epic adventure and pulp mayhem. If you want to make a good adventure movie, this is the film you must go by. Cinematic perfection is something that few movies achieve, and fewer franchises can achieve more than once. Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade fit both billings.",

Harrison Ford is once again flawless in the title role, a part that he was made for. Sean Connery is exceptional as Indy's father and familiar faces return including John Rhys-Davies' Sallah and Denholm Elliott's Marcus Brody.

            "content": "I had to come back to this, because I'm puzzled.I wonder what it is about Spielberg. Its easy to criticize his mawkish sentimentality and his theatrical sweeps. But I think it is more than that. After all, we happily tolerate that and worse in some others. And it cannot be simply that we are put off by what we imagine as his riches. After all, there is at least one film in there that was deep, and a couple that were both well made and have that quality we call personal \u0097 meaning that there's some internal insight. But even those repel me; even the \"holy\" ones.My working theory is that he is neither deep as a man, nor inclined to innovate in any way. He makes yesterday's pictures but with no added insight or annotation. So they appear as stupid. The story goes that Lucas understood this, either by being told or intuiting it. So he made up one of his Campbell-inspired, Kurosawa-flavored stories, talked his buddy into starring and turned the thing over to Steven. That first one (\"Lost Ark\") was a phenomenon. Lucas is at root a storyteller, a good one. You know, he's still filling in the Star Wars narrative. I will re-watch \"Willow\" soon. There's twice as much story as is in the movie, and Lucas was careful to find other outlets to tell it. Spielberg on the other hand is someone with an interest in shots (like Scorsese). He's interested in immediate effect, in clarity. Lucas will \u0097 every time \u0097 sacrifice that for the larger continuity of story and its integration in with the larger mythical context we carry. His films \u0097 the ones he directs \u0097 are visually barbarous, even when they copy masters.Spielberg will \u0097 every time \u0097 sacrifice the power of the story for visual juice. This is the case even when the film is supposed to be grave and deep. Remember how trilling it was to \"see\" the D-day landing? And how little it mattered, even to the rest of the film? And how little that film mattered.So I'm fascinated by this. The first film was mostly Lucas. Steven had done his one really good film (\"Encounters\") trying his darnest to be French. Then a flop, and then the first Indy film. He was simply a director hired by the then richest filmmaker in history. Then, monetary success for our Steven and the second film comes along. That one was mostly Spielberg, and ranks with his biggest disasters.Then this one. Now here we have both men playing a role. They alternate in influence, and the result is almost a film school in itself.Half of the movie is the story: father and son, greed power and goodness. Magic versus science, detective work versus adventure-driven guts. Intrigue. These are all unsophisticated in themselves, but they are basic to life. Every time we shift into this mode, the environment fades (even in the last horizon shot) and we focus on the characters.The other half of the movie is the eyewash. Now I must admit that knowing that the exterior locations are real places (excepting the fakey Austrian Castle) gives a thrill. Spielberg could not have known that this would soon matter and that anyone would be impressed by the texture of the real. But the rest is worthless. It really is. Especially disappointing is the final sequence after they enter Petra.Its all about the short view, the visual cleanliness. Its a sterility of soul, a lack of purpose. That's why I don't like the man, or anything he does.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",

Once more Indiana Jones is searching for an holy artifact (the holy grail) and is traveling around the world and once more he is being chased by the Nazi's.Entertainment really doesn't become any better than this. Never ever has there been another more entertaining and solid movie serial based around one central heroic character. Indiana Jones is an heroic adventurous person that we all admire and would love to be like. It's one of the key elements that makes the Indiana Jones movies so popular and entertaining to watch, all over the world. East or West, poor or rich, everyone loves to watch an Indiana Jones movie.This third establishment of the Indiana Jones trilogy is in my opinion the best. \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" might be more entertaining but \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" has more than enough things in it that makes this movie such a classic and perfect one to watch.One thing is of course the perfect imaginative story, with locations set all over the world. The story takes us to some of the wonderful places of this planet and does this in a good and consistent pace. The one moment the Jones' are in Venice the next in Germany but this doesn't work distracting at all. This is thanks to the very well flowing story. But also the story itself is very imaginative and great. It has all the elements a adventurous movie needs, chases, lot's of action, a heroic main character and some stereotype evil villains. Perhaps only thing this movie misses is a good love story.This movie is probably also the most personal of the series. It begins with young Indy's first adventure (River Phoenix) and it introduces Indy's father (Sean Connery). It gives the movie some room for a more dramatic undertone about family, a returning element in many Spielberg and Lucas movies. But don't worry, it isn't an overly present element in the movie. The movie really lies its emphasis and its entertainment and adventurous action. Still its an element that enriches the movie and makes it so much more than just another mindless entertaining-flick.The movie also brings some characters back that were severely missing in \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\". Marcus Brody is back and this time, unlike his \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" role, serves as the comic relief of the movie. It works extremely effective for the movie and it's one of the reasons why his character has grown out into a classic movie character. This is of course also thanks to Denholm Elliott's perfect portrayal of the character. Another returning character is Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), who in this movie is perhaps even more entertaining than he was in \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\".One of the things that makes this movie better and lets it distinct itself from the other Indiana Jones movies is the presence of Sean Connery as Indiana Jones his father. He and Harrison Ford have an amazing chemistry together, even though they are only 12 years apart. It gives the movie so much more extra. An old man doesn't seem a likely choice for a spectacular, adventurous action movie but mainly because of that contrast his character works out so well and entertaining in the movie.Also great characters in this movie are the villains. Julian Glover is good as the main villain. He is as British as he can be but he pulls off a, to my ears, convincing American accent. Michael Byrne is really memorable as the Nazi colonel Vogel. He perhaps plays the most stereotypical memorable Nazi out of cinematic history.The action is truly superb and very well directed. It provides the movie with some memorable sequences and spectacular moments.The John Williams musical score is the icing on the cake. It's spectacular, sweeping and matches perfectly with everything happening on the screen. Also the cinematography is quite superb. It's a perfect ending for Douglas Slocombe's career, who is still alive but is retired.Sure, Indiana Jones 4 (if it ever gets made, still have my doubts if it will) will most probably be good and at least entertaining to watch but fact remains that this movie forms a perfect ending for the series. The heroes riding into the sunset, can it be anymore symbolic, definitive and perfectly suiting?10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

There are actually things I like about Skull, but not this copycat of Raiders of the Lost Ark.The movie starts out with a silly, \"childish\" sequence of a Young Indiana Jones (essayed by River Phoenix, who looks NOTHING like a younger version of Harrison Ford) on an exploring trip with his boy scout troop in 1912 Utah, who finds an ancient relic in a cave and is pursued by nefarious villainous types, and goes through all these requisite stunts that mimic action sequences we've already seen in the first 2 movies, but these scenes EXPLAIN Indy's phobias and adult idiosyncrasies. Indy eventually loses the battle, giving up the artifact to the bad guys, but is supposed to have learned a valuable lesson about life....YAWN! We also get a glimpse of Indy's Dad. Flashforward to the film's setting, 1939, where Professor Jones is teaching at university while horny college girls drool over him like a rock star (just like in the original film). Then ANOTHER group of nefarious types approach him about some stone artifact they found in the ocean that is proof of the existence of the Holy Grail, so Indy goes on a trek across the globe (just like in the original film), which encompasses Italy, Germany, and Israel, in search of the Grail. Along for the ride is Indy's Dad Henry Jones (played by Sean Connery in blatant stunt casting), who was the leader of the original mission to find the Grail. And guess how the end up meeting? See, these Nazis are holding Jones Sr. hostage because they are also interested in finding the precious artifact. Does the word \"Nazi\" sound familiar? JUST LIKE IN THE ORIGINAL FILM! I'm sensing a trend here. Also, there is the required female sidekick. Of course, it's never a bad idea to have an attractive lady in a movie, but this one is a stereotypical blonde bimbo who is supposed to be some kind of smart DOCTOR. I've seen half-naked Bond girls who are more convincing as smarties than this chick!Speaking of BOND, back to the stunt casting of Connery! This movie shamelessly plays on Ford and Connery's universal appeal by pairing them as son and father, because they bear absolutely NO resemblance to each other. I can suspend disbelief in a movie like \"Highlander\", because there are so many things that movie has going for it other than just Sean Connery, but not in this movie. He is in no way, shape, or form convincing as Indy's Dad. Ford had way more chemistry with his co-stars in the previous 2 movies. The humor between the 2 actors is very strained and not funny, their dialog composed of endless, annoying bickering.The action in this movie is nothing to write home about either. It's amazing, but I actually thought much of the effects in this movie looked incredibly cheesy! And this movie came out years AFTER the first 2 movies, whose effects to this day look fresh and engaging. Then we have the repetitive battles with Nazis. Now, I actually think that Temple of Doom is the best Indy flick, but Raiders still is entertaining with many positives, and at least the villains in that movie had a panache and mystique about them with talented actors playing them with flair, but the villains in this are incredibly stale with no flair.What boggles my mind even more is that there is a healthy amount of fans that actually think THIS awful movie is the BEST of the original trilogy when it is nothing but a sad clone of the Raiders and not nearly as entertaining as Doom! A case where mindless action wins over real filmmaking. Can't win 'em all!",

Harrison Ford and Sean Connery carry the movie with their hilarious father and Son banter!Takeaways:\n-Harrison Ford shines again as Indy.-Sean Connery as Henry Jones Sr is just perfect casting! He has differences yet similarities to his Son. First off, they are both committed explorers, though the dad is stupid at times. Especially when he is firing a Gatling gun on a plane. Also he is not violent like his son (he doesn't punch bad guys)-The Holy Grail is a great reason for an adventure, as people search for immortality. Though people aren't aware of the price people must pay for said immortality.It was great seeing Marcus (Dernhilm Elliot) and Sallah (John Rhys Davies) again.-The villians are great. Julian Glover is great as the villain, Walter DonnovanAllison doodley is Great as Elsa, whom uses her charms on both Indy and his father (lol hilarious) but ultimately what she truly loves is Power and immortality.Lol Indy's full name is Henry Jones Jr.Henry Sr: \"Junior, we named the dog Indiana. Your name is Henry Jones Jr.\"\nIndy: \"I had a lot of memores with that dog\"The Tank chase was great! So was the final Temple encounter, with the knight!Conclusion: there appears to be a disagreement over which Indy movie is the best one in the series. Some say it's Raiders, but others say that it is The Last crusade and rightfully so! This is great movie, it is light hearted, fun and at the time, it was a perfect send off for the franchise, as they all rode off in the sunset on their horses.",

I'm surprised that I enjoyed 'Temple of Doom' more than the first one and gave it an A+. I was looking forward to 'The Last Crusade' and now, its pretty evident how much I loved it 'The Last Crusade' joins the adventure of Indiana Jones once more who is on a rescue mission to rescue his father, Henry Jones, who went missing on his search for the Holy Grail. This film is purely brilliant in every way possible. The story is the best of three. The characters in this movie are much better than they are in the first two, even though I like the villain in the second one more than I did in the first one and this one. The musical score by John Williams in this movie is to me, the best its ever been and feels even more magical than the first two. The characters and story are engaging, the movie is directed and written almost perfectly and overall, the movie is very comedic in its tone but also serious, with two such opposing tones mixing together perfectly! There are so many amazing sequences that clearly demonstrate just how amazing the art of film making was back in the glory days. There are so many scenes that are filmed amazingly, the visual effects looking great and the action sequences looking better than most CGI crap today. The film is well aware to not be over the top but is instead a perfect blend of just the right amount of everything necessary to make a movie great.There are however a few goofy scenes with Henry Jones but this is so easily forgotten as everything else in the movie is beyond the credibility of film making.In conclusion, I can easily draw the review down to this and say that this movie is an absolute must see but is always best to watch the first two and come into this. Every aspect of film making is easily surpassed in this masterpiece. Must see A++ In my Top 10 all time favorite movies!",

It still isn't anything extraordinary, but it's certainly a more enjoyable ride.Harrison Ford, again great, is belatedly joined by a co-star who is on his level in Sean Connery. Ford and Connery are excellent together, raising the film's pedigree whilst also adding better humour. Even away from those two, the cast is a marked improvement as we see John Rhys-Davies return alongside newcomer Julian Glover.The plot is still the weaker part of Indiana Jones, at least to me. I wasn't really interested in the objective of The Last Crusade, not that I was bored but I wasn't overly engrossed; just like with 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'.There's still a lot of good to this though, particularly with John Williams' music once more. It has been a consistent if underwhelming trilogy so far, yet I'm still intrigued to see what 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' brings to the table.",

            "content": "When it comes to the most iconic film characters of all time, Indiana Jones is near the top of that list. The amount of unbelievable journeys he has gone on has been unparalleled to say the least. The Last Crusade just adds to the fun with Sean Connery portraying Indi's father. Raiders did a great job in establishing this laid back tone with glimpses of darkness along the way. Where as Temple of Doom in my opinion steered away from the tone of the franchise and never seemed to capture my attention as much as the book ends did. It's very hard at this point to pick which out of the two i liked more, but the franchise is most definitely cemented as one of the greatest of all time.Out of the three The Last Crusade has the most action and the pacing is brilliant. You get a 15-20 scene of chases and adventure and then 10-15 minute of key dialog in the over all story. Much like Big Fish and About Time this film is an adventure film with plenty of mystery, but when it comes down to it, its a story about father and son reconnecting. The story is heartfelt and some of the better acting both Connery and Ford have done. When you get two actors of their caliber you can count on that they will deliver the performances needed to sell this bond between father and son. The film is on the shoulders of those two, and they carried this classic to the very end.It also helps when a movie actually makes you believe the leads are in true danger. With huge franchises it is often tough to sell the audience into thinking our favorite character may actually die, but this film did that. But i can say this film is not without it's problems. While Raiders was special because of the villain, Crusade wasn't anything too spectacular. A villain needs a good back story and motivation to do the things they do. I didn't feel at all intrigued by the Nazi leader. It was just great to see Indi kick his butt in the end. Ford is a movie star so i cant say it wouldn't be great to see him back in the role one day but that time has likely past. They have big shoes to fill but the fan favorites Chris Pratt or Bradley Cooper would do the role justice.+Non stop entertainment+Father-Son duo+Belief that our characters are at risk+Beautifully paced-Weak villain8.5/10",

            "content": "A+ The Indiana Jones original trilogy, before it became an anthology with its blundered fourth film, is one of the rare treats in cinema. Here you have a great setup, and it is followed thru for the vast majority of the sequels. In saying so I might as well mention that in my opinion the most perfect trilogies in all of movie history are the Toy Story films, the original Star Wars, and my beloved Evil Dead series. It's debatable whether one likes \"Return of the Jedi\", \"Temple of Doom\", or \"Army of Darkness\", but either way none of those films caused the respective series to crash and burn like \"Batman Forever\".\"The Last Crusade\" is an epic success on so many levels it could very well be the best of all three. First off, you get to see Indiana Jones as a kid which was just an awesome sequence. Secondly, it's such an incredibly strong cast. Harrison ford and Sean Connery play off each other so well the father-son concept is both comedic yet emotional. I just never tire of their scenes together. Returning are both Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody and John Rhys Davies as Sallah, contributing nicely. Alison Doody may be my favorite actress of the three. Karen Allen was pretty awesome, I never really cared for Kate Capshaw, but Doody has a sexy charm to her that appeals the most to me because she pulls of the role of the villainess so well. The joke of how promiscuous she is never gets old. Michael Byrne was pretty menacing, and I really liked the character played by Kevork Malikyan. After all the titular quote is uttered by him.The story is well written, just like the others paying homage to the 30s serial heroes. It's often sophisticated yet always fun, and the awe-inspiring action scenes are some of the best out of frankly all four. The score by John Williams is amazing, adding to the mystic quite nicely. \"The Last Crusade\" is arguably one of Steven Spielberg's and George Lucas' best works.",

            "content": "Third time lucky for George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, who followed 1984's INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM with this engaging comedy/adventure yarn which doesn't equal the dizzy heights of the previous adventures - it's a little too samey to do that - but still proves to be a better-than-average film of its type. My only complaint is the reliance on back projection, something not seen so much in the previous two films, which actually dates this more than RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK despite the fact that RAIDERS was made eight years later (the poor effects are highlighted in the plane fight sequence). The film expertly blends comedy and adventure to make a fun, action-packed romp.Once again, the formula is familiar and offers up a ton of cliffhanging set-pieces. There's the opening train chase involving River Phoenix's young Indy; a thrilling fight on a boat which is being torn to shreds by a huge propeller; boat and motorbike chases; an excellent bit of action on a tank; and of course the finale which turns the deadly traps - a staple of the series - into an art form. The film is nicely violent in parts, with bloody shootings and a surprise decapitation, and bad guy Julian Glover gets a superbly gruesome demise after drinking from the wrong chalice and disintegrating into a skeleton at the film's conclusion - a scene which had me cowering behind my seat in tears when I saw it first as a kid.Harrison Ford effortlessly adopts the Indiana Jones mantle again after a five-year break, and despite looking slightly older he carries off the action and wisecracks with aplomb. Sean Connery - an actor I really didn't used to like very much - also acquits himself well with what is essentially the bumbling sidekick role (after the success of LETHAL WEAPON at the cinema, buddy-buddy movies were everywhere). Thanks to the presence of Connery's sidekick, there isn't an annoyingly ditzy female lead for a change, although Alison Doody gives her money's worth as a smouldering Nazi spy. Julian Glover excels as the smooth villain and it's nice to see Brits John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliott in major parts of the story. A thoroughly exciting - and funny with it - slice of old fashioned escapism, the kind they just didn't make in the 1990s.",

What he finds is a trail leading to the grail hotly contested by Nazi's seeking the cup that brings eternal life.  Joneses Junior and Senior race against time to find the Grail before the Nazi's.After the disappointment of the second of the series this was a chance to redeem the series.  Temple of Doom was too nasty and gorey to be totally fun.  Raiders of the Lost Ark was huge fun with very little reality and this is what is brought back here.  The plot is similar in theme to Raiders, with many of the characters brought back.  The fact that some of the story is just ridiculous is easily overlooked by the fun and the fact that it's tongue is firmly in it's cheek the whole time.  Speilberg knows it's a bit silly and OTT at times, but rather than let it be a downer he lets it add to the fun of the whole thing.As with the others in the series this is packed with great set pieces - some with comedy mixed in (such as the Joneses trapped in a burning room) others with great action (the chase across the desert) and others with gore (the conclusion).  It's all good old fashioned fun to watch and tremendous fun all the way.Ford is as good as ever and seems a lot more at home than when he did Temple of Doom.  Connery is a great choice for his dad (despite him only being 12 years older than Ford), his easy going attitude contrast well with Ford's action hero.  It's also good to see Dermot Elliott back again (and very well used) as well as John Rhys-Davis.  British comedian Alexis Sayle makes a surreal appearance and the bad guys are very much carbon copies of the Nazi charicatures used in Raiders.Overall this is tremendous fun and more than makes up for the disappointment that was Temple of Doom.",

Connery and Ford make a great pair, and instead of the ark of the covenant, they are after the holy grail, no Monty Python to be found.This starts like the first one did, with an old adventure, this time going back to the young Indiana (River Phoenix) who is after an ancient Indian relic in his home state. We fast forward to years later, still trying to get it, and then he's reunited with the loveable Marcus (Denholm Elliott) who tells him about the quest got the grail. This leads him onto another quest, to find his father, being held by men sworn to protect the grail, and eventually chased by Nazi's who have their own reason for wanting to get their hands on the grail, as well as the evil Julian Glover, a megalomaniac madman seeking eternal life.As usual, there's a beautiful woman, Alison Doody, a doctor of archaeology who may or may not be in cahoots with the Nazi's. The journey to the valley where the grail is comes after some really thrilling adventures including trips on a dirigible, a plane being chased by the German's bullets and later on the ground in a stolen car. The villains are terrifically evil (in keeping with the series tribute to the serials of Spielberg's youth), and Doody is an alluring if dangerous femme fatale.

            "content": "The great adventurer returns! In the third instalment of the escapades of heroic archaeologist Indiana Jones, Steven Spielberg has reverted to the original formula that made the first film, \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", such an overwhelming success. And after the Gothic, action bursting \"Temple of Doom\", thank goodness he has. Not only has the tongue-in-cheek humour and light-hearted adventure of \"Raiders\" resurfaced here, but the plot is again along the same lines. Two years after his 1936 pursuit of the Ark, Doctor Jones once more finds himself pursuing a religious artifact. This time it's the revered Cup of Christ, better known as the Holy Grail. No prizes for guessing that the Nazis are of course his nemesis, lead naturally by a megalomaniac non-German whose only goal is self-glorification.Okay, perhaps this new story from George Lucas and Menno Meyjes may not be incredibly innovative nor original, but their dialogue is truly incisive and comically effective, especially in the lively exchanges between Indy and his new sidekick.Harrison Ford is joined in his adventures this time by Sean Connery, who plays his rather uninitiated father, professor Henry Jones. These two old hands of the cinema (Ford a veteran of twenty years, Connery of thirty) provide much of the entertainment that is offered throughout the movie, engaging in some hilarious by-play and a few very memorable scenes. They develop a rapport that will have you totally convinced that they are blood related, such is the chemistry they create.Sean Connery manages not only to create a wonderful new cinematic character, but also seems to have a great deal of fun almost sending up his \"James Bond\" image, playing the inept older partner to Ford's world weary hero. In an outstanding performance, Connery easily steals the majority of the scenes he's in. Not to under-rate the talents of Harrison Ford though, who (not always outdone by his co-star) is still the star of the show. Perhaps Ford's Indiana Jones is becoming a little too invincible, escaping more hair-raising tight spots that an ordinary 'human' hero has a right to, he's still however fantastic to root for.Support cast are also most enjoyable, especially Denholm Elliot as Marcus Brody and John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, both welcome returns from \"Raiders\". It is the villains that are the disappointment. Instead of the delicious nasties like the effervescent, charismatic Belloq, and the shifty, evil Toht (both of whom graced \"Raiders\"), this instalment presents us with an uninspired obsessive Donovan (Julian Glover), and a one-dimensional Nazi commander. Alison Doody is an attractive femme fatale, though never a match for the feisty Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). River Phoenix drops in as a young Indiana in a segment from 1912 which helps to explain away some of the intrepid archaeologist's secrets and motivations.Always a treat is maestro John Williams score, which introduces some invigorating new themes, as well as a familiar old one that serves as a very clever in-joke. Douglas Slocombe's camera follows the action superbly, and now familiar editor Michael Kahn sets a telling pace.With \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" Spielberg has undeniably cemented the great archaeologist's reputation as the world's most fearless adventurer. Filled with thrills 'n' spills, lethal hit men and deadly booby traps, its a movie all the young at heart should enjoy.Saturday, July 22, 1995 - Video",

But what really propels this story to greatness are the characters; they receive their strongest treatment here as Indy struggles to reconcile things with his dad (not to mention, the opening flashback reveals a lot about their characters).The film is still competently made, with quality photography. Acting is great; Harrison Ford is still perfect as the main hero, Sean Connery is perfectly cast as Indy's father, Alison Doody is appealing, John Rhys-Davies is still the man, Julian Glover is decent as the villain, and River Phoenix was perfect in his role. Writing is good, production value is high, and the music is awesome.Recommended! 5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)",

            "content": "I've never been a massive fan of the Indiana Jones movies so forgive me when I say I don't believe this movie really belongs in the mid section of the IMDb top 250 movies because it's no masterpiece of cinema As good old fashioned entertainment it certainly succeeds but as a great movie it's flawed . Despite an attempt to bring character development to the eponymous character at the start of the movie the screenplay by Jeffrey Boam quickly becomes a merger between the first two movies with a secret cult protecting a sacred object and Nazis wanting to get their hands on it . There is a subplot featuring Nazi traitors but when the traitors are revealed about 50 minutes into the running time it means there's nowhere else for the story to go hence the story becomes bogged down in a long set piece involving a Nazi ubertank To be fair the positives outweigh the negatives and it's good to see Sean Connery in a blockbuster where his presence lends weight . In fact just think how much worse this movie could have been without the British talent in front of the camera , Julien Glover is impressive and even John Rhys Davies makes an impact . We also have scenes of violence that are fun without becoming too explicit which is my major gripe with RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK which probably makes this sequel the best in the series even though it's not a truly great film I think it'd be a mistake to continue the series ala STAR WARS though",

            "content": "This installment of an otherwise successful run of movies was the most contrived piece of garbage I've ever seen. They tried to explain the scar on Indiana's chin, his fear of snakes, his style of dress, and his love of all things arcane, in the first ten or fifteen minutes of the movie, and frankly, it just didn't work for me. As much as I loved the first two of these installments, this one just left me cold. After that ten minutes, however, things did get better..for a while.I found Sean Connery's character's need to debase our hero, to be trite and just wrong. I hated it, in fact. I cared not for his ramblings, considering his son had all this field experience, and he obviously was more at home in a museum. Heck, at his age, he could almost be an exhibit. I really detested the way they used Connery to lower our estimation of Ford's character. I would have liked it better had they worked together, rather than having been written to constantly go at one another. It devalued the whole franchise for me. The whole movie was not awful, but this was the first installment with which I had any issues whatsoever. The next thing I found wrong with this attempt was that they went back to the Germans again, rather than moving on to something new. The relic for which Indiana Jones is searching is new, but the story was more of an attempt to redeem themselves after the gore of The Temple of Doom. I frankly did not mind the gore; that story and execution of that story was excellently done.So, okay, it is the Germans again. Nothing we can do about that. And, again, the artifact is a Christian artifact. What with all the wonderful legendary relics of our richly documented mythological ancestries, why go back to something that has already been touched upon? This is more like a remaking of the Raiders of the Lost Ark, than a new installment.What about the lost library of Alexandria? What about Atlantis? What about the Bermuda Triangle? Stonehenge? The Isle of White? Easter Island? The literal thousands of mysteries in Carnac, Cairo, or Thebes, such as the Great Sphinx and the secret room which is supposed to be hidden there? The headpiece of Isis which was supposed to show the gateway to the heavens, and so on? Why go back to the same original formula of the first, only to end the franchise there? If they were setting up for a new run, then I could see going back to the beginning, but this was not the beginning of a new run. This was the end of the run. So I fail to conceive of why they would copy the first movie so closely in both specifics AND generalities. I can understand why they would feel the need, perhaps, for deeper character development with Jones and his father, hence their bringing in Connery to debase Indiana and make us view him in a lesser light. But again, that is in the case of the beginning of a new run, but as I said, this was the end of the run, so why DO that? We loved the character just fine, without the in-depth character development, and certainly without being made to feel sorry for his character by being subjected to an unappreciative father's constant haranguing. I simply do not see the reasoning behind it. It lowered my entire estimation of this movie, something fierce. Where this final chapter could have been great, it was simply...okay, and rather a disappointment. I was glad this was to be the last of the Indiana Jones movies, if that was what they were reduced to. There are some good elements here, please do not get me wrong. The movie was still moderately enjoyable. The mysteries and intrigues were craftily written, the dialog was witty and clever, and the effects were excellent Lucas/Spielberg fare. I just found Connery's noisome presence to be totally undesirable and unnecessary.But now, as of this writing, at any rate (01/01/04), there are plans to do another installment, with Ford, at the ripe old age of 62. I must really say, \"I have doubts.\" If his latest film, \"Hollywood Homicide\" is any indication, I will have to say that they will be much better off leaving him in the university, this time. It was truly sad to witness his performance in that movie. He ~fell down~ more than he pulled his gun! I was very disheartened to see him like that. With \"What Lies Beneath,\" at least they had a new genre for him, something which would allow him to gracefully age into ultra-maturity. But no, they could not leave it at that. It will take over a year for them to film Indiana Jones 4, what with having to stop every few minutes, to let Ford catch his breath and freshen up. But with the problematic script and postponement after postponement, they may end up scrapping this movie all together. I DO hope so. But if I'm wrong, I hope they leave Connery out of this next one.Regardless of its short-comings, it still earns an 7.4 from...the Fiend :.",

It almost is just a highlight of the ridiculous lengths that Nazi's went to look for weird resources: the occult (\"Hellboy\"), artifacts, and investigations into alien contact.This is a return to quality though, it takes up the more serious atmosphere of the first movie and with that concentrates on a dramatically good action adventure movie.This is my favorite of the franchise.",

            "content": "The Indy film I saw was terrible, full of bad humor, jokey villains, horrid effects and witless action.  If there is some great 3rd Indy movie out there, could someone please point it out to me because I'd love to see it.It certainly couldn't be Last Crusade which is a terrible film for so many reasons.  Let's begin at the beginning.  The opening sequence with River Phoenix as young Indy just screams \"CONTRIVED\"  By this point the Indiana mystique was so high, someone felt the need to explain many of Indy's trademarks, so in one 10 minute sequence, we get the origin of his hat, his whip, his fear of snakes, the scar on his chin and his basic sense of right & wrong.  If any 40+ year old human being could claim that so much of their personality comes from a single 10 minute incident as a child I would laugh in their face.  Aside from the completely ridiculous nature of the sequence, even getting into the spirit of fun is next to impossible when the effects are so bad... the \"animals\" looked like refugees from Disneyland. When \"Anaconda\" had a snake that bad, people rightfully laughed, yet here people seem to think this makes for good filmmaking.A couple of characters return from the first movie but as a fan I have to ask why?  Did they bring Brody back to act as a mentor to Indy, to regale him (and us) with his exploits as a young archaeologist?  Nope, they brought him back to turn him into a bumbling buffoon.  Was Sallah brought back to act as Indy's contact & right hand man, to help him through strange and exotic lands where Indy may not be able to secure the resources he needs, but Sallah can?  No, he was brought back to make camel jokes. ::sigh::Now as for those famous Indy action scenes: in Raiders, Indy got the snot kicked out of him but always relied on his brains to survive (passing under a truck was a great stunt and a deft move for Indy to take).  In the tank chase here, does Indy's intelligence save him?  Does his skill?  The answer is no, it's pure, blind luck.  And who really thought he was ever in any real danger? Besides how dangerous is a poorly blue screened tank anyway?While Sallah & Brody were reduced to cartoon characters, Indy himself became a joke, playing straight man to his father whose dialogue seemed to come from a TV sitcom, the only thing missing was the laugh track.Of course, the only people more comicly inept that Indy & friends were the Nazi villains.  It's hard to imagine these wanna-be keystone cops taking over a bowling alley let alone most of Europe.  But of course, this plays right into the idea that hapless Indy can't face an actual challenging villain that might require skill and intelligence to defeat since in this movie, Indy displays no skill or intelligence.Overall this movie is a hapless, witless exercise in attempted crowd pleasing that only succeeds in pleasing those hapless & witless enough to accept whatever drek the filmmakers give us instead of demanding real characters, real adventure, real thrills and real humor.So for those of you with a videotape of the \"best Indy ever\" some of you are claiming to have seen, please, send me a copy so I can throw out my version of Last Crusade which obviously has all the good parts edited out.",

The duo exchange some lively banter in a believable way, bringing more depth to both characters and making us care more about their adventures.Keeping the Holy Grail out of the clutches of the Nazis is what makes the story click from the start, with adventures that range from sea to desert to majestic mountain hideaways, all while Indy and his dad are hotly pursued by the Nazis anxious to get their hands on the cup that promises immortality.A good supporting cast is on hand to give the story all the excitement it generates, including Denholm Elliot as a clueless professor and Alison Doody as an adventuress who seems to be helping the Nazis but turns against them at a crucial moment until her own greed works against her fate.All of it is filmed at a breathtaking pace, never stopping long enough to make you dwell on flaws in the logic of Indy's cliffhanging escapes and fights with Nazis aboard tanks in the desert. But aside from action, the script provides plenty of insight into the relationship between father and son, peppered with some witty dialog.All ages should enjoy this one, about as good as the original Indy film with the addition of Sean Connery providing bits of warmth and humor as dad to the world's most beloved archaeologist.",

            "content": "It didn't take long for Spielberg and George Lucas to cash in (literally) on the financial success the second Indiana Jones movie brought to their names, as well as to film making in general. While I personally have mixed feelings about Temple of Doom, I will always remember it as the stepping stone to this third entry, which in my view, redeems any wrongdoings committed by the second. A big complaint about the second movie was that there were no nazis in it, and thus having Indy fight against insane cultists basically ruined the tension. The third reich is back in The Last Crusade, and this time, they won't be beaten so easily. As usual, Harrison Ford reprises his character from the first two movies, but Last Crusade also introduces his father, Henry Jones Sr, played by Sean Connery. He's a very important part to the story because his diary serves as a blueprint for Indy's adventure. The movie begins in 1912, and Indiana Jones is only a teenager. As of right now, he's taking part in an expedition to a cave in Utah, where he discovers some grave robbers attempting to steal a 16th century crucifix studded with solid gold and gemstones. After securing it, he is chased by the men and forced to clamber onto a train carrying a bunch of circus related items. Here, he acquires a whip and learns how to use it for the first time. Eventually, Indy makes it back to his dad's house and wants his father to look at the valuable item he has, but he's not interested. A gang of men accompanied by cops ride up to the house and Indy is forced to surrender his treasure to them. Over 20 years later, Jones fights this same gang on a ship in stormy waters off the coast of Portugal and manages to sink the ship, killing all onboard. Some time after, Jones meets with a rich socialite named Walter Donovan, who is secretly a nazi. He tells Jones how he wants him to travel to Venice in order to meet someone named \"Schneider\", who is able to point him in the direction of the exact grail Jesus drank from during the last supper. Upon reaching Italy, it's revealed (Elsa) Schneider is a woman. Jones and her access some hidden passageways under a library (that used to be a church) and eventually come across a coffin. Inside, they discover a shield which has a complete version of the crucifix pattern Indy's father drew in his diary. Unfortunately, some assassins have realized what's going on and attempt to burn Indy and Elsa out of the catacombs with torches. They manage to escape in motorboats, and Jones gives his father's diary to a turkish friend of his to keep it out of nazi hands. Soon, he arrives at the austrian-german border. Here, a large castle with a gaggle of nazis inside is apparently the hiding place of Henry Jones Sr. After Indy is reunited with his father, an SS colonel named Vogel holds Elsa at gunpoint and demands Jones to surrender or else he will kill his friend. He puts down his weapons, only to learn it was a trap. Elsa is actually a nazi. In the lower level of the castle, Jones and his father are brought before none other than Donovan, who is best friends with the third reich now. Being faced with another difficult situation, the Jones' are tied to chairs, and Elsa leaves with Donovan. Indy attempts to burn through the rope holding him in place using a cigarette lighter, but drops it and the room goes up in flames. They manage to escape with little time to spare, and are able to commandeer a german motorcycle. After an intense chase, Jones travels to Berlin itself in order to get his father's diary back from Elsa. He's clearly upset with her, but can't kill her in the company of so many of her fellow nazis. Jones even comes face to face with Hitler, who signs his father's diary without knowing what it actually is. Jones and his father then hitch a ride on a zeppelin and attempt to flee the country, but Vogel learns of their presence and alerts everyone. This means Jones has to escape in a biplane slung underneath the blimp's dorsal structure, with his father manning the machine gun in the backseat. Unsurprisingly, Jones crashes the plane but the two manage to elude the germans again. The scenery then undergoes a change, and we're suddenly in Turkey, where the local sultan has employed the nazis to find the Holy Grail for him. Colonel Vogel leads a large convoy of supply trucks in his personal tank, and his flanks are heavily guarded. Despite Jones Sr. Being taken hostage inside the vehicle, Indy climbs onto the tank and engages Vogel in a fistfight, distracting him long enough to have the tank fall off the side of a cliff. Finally, the home stretch of the film takes place in a temple located in a valley. Donovan, Elsa, and the rest of the nazis are here, and they are trying to steal the Grail. The way to it is laden with traps, and Donovan shoots Indy's father so that Indy has to venture in and find the grail himself. After overcoming things such as buzzsaws, bottomless pits, and false jumps that lead to nowhere, Indy arrives in a large room being guarded by a single knight, who has been kept alive for the last 700 years because of the grail's powers. Little does Indy know, Elsa and Donovan have followed him in. Donovan chooses the wrong grail to drink from, which results in him dying a horrible and violent death as all his skin decomposes extremely quickly. Indy chooses a humbler looking grail (one that has no gold on it) and says it looks more befitting of a humble person like Jesus. He has made the right decision. Indy isn't killed upon drinking from it, and his father is healed when he lets him use it. As for Elsa, she tries to leave with the grail and falls to her death after triggering an earthquake. Indy almost takes it with him, but his father says not to. I have to say, after the somewhat disappointing second entry in the series, I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this movie. What I got though was simply a vast improvement on its predecessor. One of my biggest complaints about Temple of Doom was how obnoxious the side characters were. Willie was the typical damsel in distress that didn't do much other than stand around and yell whenever she got into trouble. Elsa is a much more tolerable character, and is clearly more intelligent. No irritating small kid sidekick following Indy this time either (thank god). The movie is also a winner for me because it has such a huge variety of locations compared to the previous film. It features deserts, coastal towns, mountainous areas, beaches, and temples. Connery was great too. It does get kind of annoying seeing Harrision Ford constantly yell at his \"father\" because he often falls behind in the chase scenes, but that's solely on Ford's part. The action scenes themselves in this film were also way better than Temple of Doom. The scene where Indy fights Vogel on top of the tank is still spectacular. This time, I just cared more about what was happening. Overall, many might disagree with me on this, but I feel that Last Crusade is a much more impressive movie than not only the second Indy film, but the first one as well.",

            "content": "\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" usually gets the lion's share of the praise when discussing the Indiana Jones series but I believe that the third entry is actually the best.Here, Spielberg & Lucas returned to the style of \"Raiders\" while also refining all of the elements that made that film memorable. This time Jones is searching for perhaps the most fabled artifact of all, the holy grail.In comparison to \"Raiders\", I think that the script is more polished, utilizes comedy more effectively and includes set-pieces that are just as entertaining as those seen previously. That being said, at first there's a bit of a sense of 'been there, done that' since the early scenes are a little too similar to the first film. However, the film soon finds its groove and doesn't let up until the credits roll.A bonus this time around is the fact that Sean Connery stars as Jones's father. Ford & Connery are great together and the pairing lets us see aspects of the character that hadn't been explored before. John Rhys-Davies & Denholm Elliott reprise their roles from the first film while Alison Doody & Julian Glover do a fine job of portraying Jones's love interest and nemesis, respectively.Spielberg's direction is once again top-notch and the special effects are solid. John Williams returns with another Oscar-nominated score that recaptures the spirit of the original. Overall, the production values are first-rate.In the end, though, the most important thing to note about this film is that it's a hell of a lot of fun. I don't think that you could have asked for a better capper to the series, which is why it puzzles me that Spielberg & Lucas decided to revisit the character nearly twenty years later. As with \"Star Wars\", stick with the original trilogy and you won't be disappointed.",

The first ten minutes see young Indiana (River Phoenix) having his first adventure to rescue an artefact, a cross, and getting his iconic chin scar and fedora felt hat. Then, 1938, grown up Indy (Harrison Ford) is on a ship fighting to get the cross (oh, it is meant to be three years after he found the Lost Ark). Then the real story begins, he meets artefact collector, Walter Donovan (Julian Glover), who shows him a tablet marker with details about the cup of Christ (that he used during the last supper), the Holy Grail, which if drunk from will give eternal life/immortality. Donovan tells him to pick up where the scientist expert left off in Venice, Italy, believed to be the location of the second tablet marker, oh, this expert is Indy's father! So, he meets his Dad's assistant, Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), they find the second marker under the library in the sewers, and some cultists dedicated to stopping anyone finding the Grail are after them for a while. He reaches his Dad, Professor Henry Jones (the excellent BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Sir Sean Connery), and after escaping the Nazi Germans (yes, their back) they are on the run trying to get to the resting place of the Grail first. Old friends Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliot) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) also join them along the journey. Also starring Michael Byrne as Vogel, Kevork Malikyan as Kazim, Robert Eddison as Grail Knight, Richard Young as Fedora, Alexei Sayle as Sultan and Indy even comes face to face with Adolf Hitler (Michael Sheard). I should mention that Indiana's real name is Henry, that's why his Dad insists on calling him 'Junior' (George Lucas as writer named the character after his dog, Indiana, just like in the film). It won the Oscar for Best Sound Effects Editing, and it was nominated for Best Music for John Williams and Best Sound, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Sound and Best Special Effects. Steven Spielberg was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, River Phoenix was number 69, Sir Sean Connery number 8, and Harrison Ford number 5 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Connery was also number 3 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and Indiana Jones was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains.

The screenplay, written by Jeffrey Boam, is terrific. It has the right amount of comedy one-liners and adventure to hold your attention for 2 hours. I have to comment on this character of Indiana Jones again.

            "review_title": "Another satisfying adventure, which redeemed the franchise after \"Temple of Doom\"",
            "content": "\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" is a prequel to \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", the first and most popular installment in the Indiana Jones franchise, whereas \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" is a sequel to the 1981 blockbuster. In terms of popularity, this third installment comes somewhere in between its two predecessors. I saw a bit of \"Last Crusade\" on TV, starting near the end of the film, as a kid. I think this was around 1993, but I didn't know what I was seeing at the time. After all these years, I've finally found out that it was this 1989 action adventure I was seeing. While it didn't do much for me years ago, and I was too young for it at the time (one MIGHT wonder why it didn't really frighten me), watching it from start to finish twenty years after its release was not an experience to forget.In 1938, Indiana Jones is informed by a wealthy businessman named Walter Donovan that the leader of an expedition for the Holy Grail has mysteriously disappeared, and that leader happens to be Indy's estranged father, Professor Henry Jones, Sr.! Indy has received a package in the mail from Italy, which turns out to be his father's diary. This diary contains clues and a nameless map to find the Grail! The archaeologist flies to Venice with Marcus Brody, and there they meet Dr. Elsa Schneider. She takes them to the library where Henry Jones, Sr. was last seen. This library used to be a church, and it turns out that there are catacombs underneath the building! Indy and Elsa go down through the floor, and after facing several life-threatening situations, Indy learns that his father is being held captive in a castle on the German-Austrian border! He goes there with Dr. Schneider to find the senior Jones, and soon does, but then learns the truth about Elsa and Walter. Both of them actually work for the Nazis, and are helping them find the Holy Grail to use for their evil!The movie starts with a prologue, featuring a young Indiana Jones in 1912, played by the late River Phoenix. Phoenix' performance may not be good as that of Harrison Ford, but it's not bad. The beginning of the movie is no match for the beginning of \"Raiders\", and the part with the grave robbers digging during the prologue is a bit silly, but the suspense quickly begins. There's much more suspense after the film skips to 1938, as usual for the Indiana Jones franchise. We once again see our hero in different types of danger in different places, making for some great, intense action! There may be some lacklustre moments, such as the bedroom scene with Indy and Elsa, but for the most part, the movie is steady. \"The Last Crusade\" introduces Indy's father, and Sean Connery shines in this role. There's definitely some humour, and Henry Jones, Sr. contributes a lot to it. Connery does a better job with the humour in this role than Kate Capshaw did as Willie Scott in \"Temple of Doom\", that's for sure. Like its two predecessors, this third installment also has some nice visuals and sets.Some have more criticisms of \"Temple of Doom\" than I do, but my main problem with that second Indiana Jones film is the brutality, which doesn't start until the second half of the film, but really brings it down in quality. Fortunately, they took the original trilogy back in the right direction with \"The Last Crusade\", as the kind of brutality featured in the second movie is nowhere to be found here. This one remains an entertaining action adventure throughout, much like the original. There are parts that could scare younger viewers, and the film is rated PG-13 (a rating that \"Temple of Doom\" apparently helped lead to the creation of), but it certainly never gets as disturbing as the middle film in the 80's trilogy eventually does. \"Last Crusade\" may not be quite as good as \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", but if not, it comes very close! For fans of the classic film that introduced the Indiana Jones character who were disappointed by its first successor, I would say this 1989 summer blockbuster was a return to form.",

            "content": "Watched Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade was, in my opinion, the best movie of the Indiana Jones Series. This movie featured the same type of humor we have become accustomed to from Dr. Jones, as well as another beautiful woman also the best Indy girl and lots of great action scenes! This movie starts with River Phoenix(Stand By Me) as Teenage Indy which gives us a look at an event that molds his life and character as well as his relationship with his father, Played By 007 Himself Sean Connery(Dr.No) We also learn he is a \"Junior\" and that he hates to be called that.Back as an adult, Indy's father is kidnapped and he must set out to find him. His only clues are his father's diary notes, which were mysteriously sent to him earlier that day. They lead him to Italy, where he meets the gorgeous German blonde, Alison Doody(A View To Kill) as Dr. Elsa Schneider , who becomes an integral part of this story.Once again, the grown up Harrison Ford(Blade Runner) as Indiana Jones does battle with the Nazis. Apparently, Adolf Hitler is after the Holy Grail, which contains the blood of Christ. So Indiana and his father team up to get there first. Along the way, there is a great action scene where Jones fights a few Nazis on board a moving tank.Overall, as I mentioned earlier, I believe this to be the best Indiana Jones movie of the three. This action movie was good long before movie studios learned to make the great CGI and special effects. It's effects were pretty good anyways but back in 1989, things just did not look as good as they can make them today. Still, highly recommended and worth your time and also amazing Score From John Williams(Star Wars) and Direction From Steven Spielberg(Jaws). 9/10",

With Sean Connery joining Ford as Indy's father Henry, this film would redeem the series after the awful \"Temple of Doom\".Introduced to Walter Donovan (Julian Glover), rich benefactor to his university, Dr Jones will this time rescue his father as he travels around the globe on the hunt of the Holy Grail.As people play roles more, it's obvious that they're going to get better at the performances. This is true more than ever with Ford's performance. Providing a fun, laid back performance, Ford's connection with Connery (who is only 12 years his senior) is a masterstroke.It's not just these two however which are so superb. Denholm Elliot as Marcus Brody is always a laugh, as is John Rhys-Davies as Sallah. Both provide an extra joke element in this feel good story.All in all, \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" is your typical adventure film. Entertaining from beginning to end, it thrives on some stunning acting performances and a great script. If you want to watch a decent adventure film, ignore \"Temple of Doom\" and go straight for this.",

            "content": "It's unanimous, \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" is one of the best action-adventure films of the series and may even be one of the best of the 1980's. The action, the humor and the sets, props and costumed are well nuanced and the action will keep you on the edge of your seat. Another great feature is that the Indy girl Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody) is up to par with our thrill-seeking archaeologist as the quick pace will make you dizzy.A memorable scene in flashbacks shows a young Indiana Jones (River Phoenix RIP) that further examines his upbringing that leads to the relationship between Dr. Jones (Harrison Ford) and his father, Dr. Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery) and his disdain to be called \"Junior\".We go back to 1938, as the adult Dr. Jones is out to rescue his father who's been kidnapped. With the help of his father's diary, which arrived unexpectedly, Dr. Jones can track down the whereabouts of his missing father. The diary locates Dr. Jones to Italy where he's introduced to Dr. Schneider who becomes a vital character in this tale.We now see Dr. Jones battling the German Nazis as the evil dictator Adolf Hitler is after the Holy Grail, which has possession to the blood of Christ. Which leads Dr. Jones and Henry Sr. chasing after the Grail before Hitler's henchman retrieve it. One of the best fight scenes was when Jones was battling the Nazis on a tank.This stands out very well in terms with very limited CGI graphics and everything looks and feels more real and natural. Even back in 1989 the graphics were pretty good and might be slightly ahead of its time. I recommend you see this movie. You won't be disappointed.",

He totally inhabits/steals every scene he is in and his chemistry with Ford is just a joy to watch.

            "content": "As the end of the 1980s was coming to a close, Indiana Jones had two films under his hat. After two exciting adventures, it was time to explore the character even more. It was an opportunity to build on his character development. Also, the series hit a stumbling block, when the second film failed to capture the greatness and magic of the first film. The producers had to jack things up, for what was essentially a comeback film. Paramount signed River Phoenix to be a young Indiana Jones. The prologue to this film goes back to 1912 and tells the story about how the teenager became the man. By doing this, a huge star had to be cast into the role of Indy's father. Who better, than the original James Bond himself, Sean Connery, as Professor Henry Jones. After the prologue we jump to modern day (or in this case 1938), which harkens in the return of Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones.Without giving too much away, Indiana gets involved with a search for the holy grail and the fountain of youth. The film contains many run-ins with the Nazi's, just like in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). To make matters worse, his father has been captured by the Nazi's. Indiana is once again reunited with his two old friends Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), as they embark on the search, but new friends, who enter the picture, aren't always what they seem. These are ingredients, that were missing in the last film, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984). By bringing these important elements back into the fold, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg were able to already capture the magical charm of the first film. The next move was to capture the energy and action of the first film too. The end results are fantastic.This film is almost as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), making both films light years ahead of the second one. I don't want to bash Temple of Doom (1984), mostly because I don't have to. Many people weren't pleased with that film anyway, so I don't need to bash it. It's not a bad film, but when your measuring stick is Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), it's tough to strike gold twice. The best way to handle it is say, \"two out of three ain't bad\". When this film came out 1n 1989 it represented the end of an era. Indiana would go on doing young Indiana Jones television shows in the 1990s, with Harrison Ford not returning, until Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). (He did make one or two cameos on the tv show, but really didn't come back until 19 years later). But, let's not talk about Indiana 4 for now. Sometimes it hurts too much.Like anything that has Lucas or Spielberg attached to it, this film uses the state-of-the-art, practical special effects for an era, that was still pre-CGI. The art direction, costumes, performances by the cast, comedy relief and thrilling action, is grade-A stuff. Even though the film can take a dark turn in places, it still leaves a warm feeling in you as the story unfolds. That is a staple of what a Spielberg film is all about. His style always makes the audience feel welcomed to the film, even if the content is not a happy one. It is that playful way that he can merge the kids fun with the adult fun. He always made everyone feel welcomed to his films. This one is no different and when I left the movie theater in 1989 I was dazzled by the whole thing. It was a great way to finalize the original Indiana Jones trilogy.9.1 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",

Like \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", Indy (Harrison Ford) must once again battle those pesky Nazis for a religious artifact, this time the Holy Grail, and thrown into the mix - along with Brody and Sallah - is Indy's adventure inexperienced dad, played by Sean Connery. Along the way, Indy even gets some character development, as we see how his dysfunctional relationship with his dad contributed to his personality.Ford and Connery are a great pair, and Alison Doody stands out as the only Jones girl who stabbed Indy in the back (and slept with both him and his dad). The late River Phoenix, the Leonardo Dicaprio of his day, also does serviceable work in the opening as the young Indy (may he rest in peace). My only real complaint is that the action seems to be on a smaller scale here, lacking the OOMPH of \"Raiders\" and the crazed, frenzied, kinetic energy of \"Temple of Doom\". However, you have to love the scene with the tank.\nOf them all, this may be the most friendly to children, excluding the fate of Walter Donovan. Enjoy!",

After the second film I was a little worried going into this one but as it turned out it's actually the best in the series. While some of the stunts might not be as thrilling as the first film, I think this one here has the most compelling story and the best screenplay overall. The movie is fast paced from start to finish and there really isn't a dry moment anywhere. I think the greatest thing about the film are the performances by Ford and Connery who do terrific work together and bring plenty of laughs. The way the two men work off one another makes for some real magic and there's also some heart as well. The action sequences are also terrific with the fantastic Nazi tank scene being the highlight. The humor thrown in the Zeppelin scene is also terrific as is the suspense of the final adventure for the Grail. The opening prologue with River Phoenix playing the young Indiana Jones is also very well handled and in my opinion this sequence alone is better than anything seen in the second movie. As the film kept going on I couldn't help but notice that I had been smiling the entire trip and in the end this is a film that really makes you feel good watching it.

            "content": "I liked Raiders of the Lost Ark and considered a masterpiece of cinema history while Temple of Doom, despite it's annoying characters and flawed plot, was at least a pretty good sequel to it's predecessor. So, when Steven Spielberg made the third film in the Indiana Jones franchise known as \"The Last Crusade\".It takes place after the events of Temple of Doom where Indiana Jones acquires a diary that holds clues and a map with no names to find the mysterious Holy Grail- which was sent from his father, Dr. Henry Jones, in Italy. Upon hearing from a private collector, Walter Donavan, that the mission for the Holy Grail went astray with the disappearance of his father, Indiana Jones and museum curator Marcus Brody venture to Italy in search of Indy's father. However, upon retrieving Dr. Henry Jones in Nazi territory, the rescue mission turns into a race to find the Holy Grail before the Nazis do- who plan to use it for complete world domination for their super-race. With the diary as a vital key and the map with no names as a guide, Indiana Jones once again finds himself in another death defying adventure of pure excitement.Well, like most people, I officially like this film despite it's lack of efficiency of Raiders of the Lost Ark which is the reason why I'm giving this a 9/10. All of the redeeming qualities saved this epic film for me. The action is as gripping as ever, the story is much more engaging than the story in Temple of Doom (which had it's insensitive portrayal of the Indian culture), the pacing is very brisk and doesn't drag on the action throughout the film and the music from the excellent John Williams is light-hearted, dramatic, and atmospheric, but the strongest aspect goes to the cast. Harrison Ford and Sean Connery had great chemistry as Indiana and his father Henry Jones, Alison Doody did great as Elsa, and Julian Glover and Michael Byrne did great as the frightening Nazis.Well, despite the fact that Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was officially the last film of the franchise, Spielberg decided to make another one nineteen years later known as \"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\" which was met with positive reviews, but received a mixed reception from fans of the trilogy. With that said, this movie is a solid improvement over Temple of Doom although not nearly as excellent as Raiders of the Lost Ark.",

His adventure led to Nazi involvement as they want the Holy Grail and the eternal life that comes with it.Shot in Spain, Italy, England, Turkey and Jordan, the movie was a financial success, earning over $474,000,000 in the box office and it went home with an Academy Award for Best Sound Editing.Here is one Indiana Jones you don't want to miss.www.lagsreviews.com",

The late River Phoenix makes a perfect young Indy, capturing all the mannerisms so well that you never doubt he is the titular hero. The exceptionally good circus-train sequence is a joyous piece of film making.As the film moves on to McGuffin driven wartime adventure, Indy travels to a variety of locations, meeting a beautiful historian and encountering lots more baddies on the way. It pretty much is Bond with a fedora and bullwhip, battling Nazis and taking an ex-Bond along for the ride. Sounds ridiculous but it's not. It really does work. Mainly due to the chemistry to the two stars and effective use of supporting characters. The gag about Marcus Brody's skills and experience as an archeological adventurer is possibly the funniest in the entire franchise.I don't place it up there with Raiders due to the recycled formula and some weak dialogue, but the performances of all and excitement gives it quality and entertainment value throughout",

This third Indiana Jones movie is such a unique and special film and story which is paradoxically simple yet complex, breezily covering some of the most important issues of life and faith as well as addressing tangentially various relationships. The pace is proper and the story covers a lot of ground in 2 hours. The beginning, middle, and end are all excellent and the cinematography is top notch, the colors and settings are beautiful and varied. The direction is superb, as is the writing. The music is also proper, not being overbearing. In fact the whole film is very easy to watch, not giving one a headache or throwing too much at the audience at one time. The acting is all great as well, the late Sean Connery makes a terrific father and the relationship between the father and son seems realistic and developed, as is the more complicated relationship with the woman, but I won't give away any spoilers.There is also just the right amount of levity in this film. But it is the story by Lucas and Meyjes which really propels this movie and makes it timeless and eminently relatable. It is essentially about the universal human desire to find immortality, good vs. Evil and the choice which we all have, and the actions and interactions with others which comprise our lives. As well as the search for humility and faith yet not striving too hard or far and succumbing to idolatry. Jesus Christ's blood which supposedly created the Grail cup is the lifegiving factor here, and if you are a follower of Him, then his blood will give you eternal life after death too, but not if you reject Him. Is there a literal Grail cup out there somewhere? I don't know and I don't really care because the Grail is really just a symbol and this story an allegory for the work done within one's own heart and mind which is invisible. And the death escaped is the second one in the afterlife, not the first one which we all know about. But by taking these simple universal concepts, some actual history, and segments of the New Testament of the Bible the writers fashioned a thrilling fictional allegory and film which is of course a metaphor for such things. Well worth watching if you have not yet done so.And it also occurs to me that the actors ages are all appropriate, this film would not be nearly as impactful if it had a cast of young twenty-somethings. The fact that it features mostly middle aged or older persons in this film about the fear of death, the questioning of faith, and the search for answers is key, it makes it all feel real and vital. In fact, Indy's whole life is shown as a search for meaning and salvation; his stealing of the cross of Coronado, a fictional Spanish artifact which means \"crowned cross\" is representative of this. However he loses this item and cannot reacquire it until much later. Yet he still views it as a material object to be possessed, studied, and displayed -- similar to his attitude in previous films. It takes until later in his life and in this film that he starts viewing these things as more than their face value. Notably even after recovering the Ark of the Covenant he still seems to doubt God and faith and asks Marcus if he believes. This very human journey for our hero makes it interesting. He is saved by his faith at the end but we don't get to hear what he learned, it is left unspoken. Meanwhile his father doesn't seem to change all that much, as he found \"illumination\", or enlightenment, faith and God which he had been after since Indy's youth in the first scene. Actually, Indy's search for his father after being estranged from him for years could also be metaphorical as Indy seeking his Heavenly Father. A similar dual meaning and theme is found in the excellent Brazilian film \"Central Station.\" And the seal which the Grail and immortality can't cross is a reference to the seal God places on His followers in the spiritual realm. I could go on, but I don't think it's necessary.",

The last one to date to really fit into the adventure-genre, \"Cutthroat Island\", didn't work out very well. It had the right feeling, and I kind of liked it. But adventure doesn't really work these days.But with Indiana Jones, it's different. Indiana Jones is set in the perfect time (what other villains are better than nazis, evil Indians or just plain crooks?), has great timing and takes great care to assure that the adventure - i.e. traveling, meeting people, solving tricky problems and gaining something in the end - feels real. To do so, one needs humor (supplied by the animosity between Jones and his father, aptly played by Connery), magic (good ole Christian legends of eternal life) and a villain.The very best part of this film is when Jones faces Hitler and gets his autograph in his fathers notebook - at a book burning fest in Berlin...

            "review_title": "Now That's What I Call Archaeology!",
            "content": "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade takes everything that made Raiders of the Lost Ark great to begin with and builds on top of that. Last Crusade is unquestionably my favourite of the series and the main reason for this being the role of Sean Connery as Indy's father Henry Jones Sr, which I consider to be one of the greatest casting choices ever made. This casting was largely due to James Bond being one of the inspirations for Indiana Jones although oddly enough despite my love of Indiana Jones I've never been keen on the James Bond films. There's something about father-son stories that I've always had a particular affection for and the relationship between Indy and his father is challenging to put into words how thematically in-depth it is. The search for the bond between father and son ends up becoming more important than the search for the grailTheir personalities differ from Henry being more of an academic and Indy being more of an adventurer (at the film's beginning Indy is struggling to even find the time to grade his student's papers), yet at heart, they are both giddy schoolboys. Their emotionally distant relationship is beautifully conveyed during their exchange on the airship in which Indy complains to his father about never being there for him. His father replies by asking him what does he want to talk about and Indy struggles to find a conversation point to dwell on. The tone of Henry's response, \"well what are you complaining about?!\" sums it up beautifully. At the film's climax when Henry finally calls his son Indiana rather than Junior, it gives me chills alongside his words of \"Let it go\" as legitimate advice I apply to many real-life situations (when has a James Bond movie had anything as remotely substantive as this?).Their scenes together are so melancholic and full of complex emotions that further humanises the character of Indiana Jones. I really do think this may be the greatest pairing of two actors ever and when I contemplate on it. I also feel this is the best performance Harrison Ford ever gave in his career, never has he been able to convey such emotion on-screen (and impersonate and art-loving Scotsman). Ford is one of few actors who can make any normal line of dialogue into something memorable.The Last Crusade is also a comedy classic in its own right from the North by Northwest type moments (\"No ticket!\") to more slapstick-oriented gags. The Hitchcock influence even extends to borrowing a moment from The Lady Vanishes in which young Indy escapes from a train via a magician's box. Likewise, the Forest Gump type moment in which Indy inadvertently confronts Hitler face to face is brilliant on so many levels. - It works the same way the clothes hanger scene from Raiders did.The supporting cast of players in the Last Crusade are second to none. Indy, Henry, Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) and Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliot) are simply so much fun to watch together on screen, with the clumsy Marcus going on the adventure (whereas in Raiders he is only seen at the beginning and end of the film) also really gives Last Crusade a big boost. Even his line \"The pen is mightier than the sword\" always cracks me up with the manner in which he delivers it in an English gentlemanly way, or Indy Sr's uttering of \"Junior!\"; music to my ears. Likewise, I'm more than happy to listen to the eloquent and well-spoken Julian Glover as Walter Donavon as himself and Harrison Ford deliver exposition and tell each other \"bedtime stories\" (and subsequently transform into Doc Brown just before his untimely demise). Ernest Vogel (Michael Byrne) on the other hand is a completely two-dimensional villain in the best way possible with his intimidating presence as one really evil, tall, uniformed Nazi with a powerful music cue to introduce him in any scene. He has also has one of the most comical deaths in any film ever in a bizarrely campy two-second shot on him falling towards the camera. - Even the actor playing the Grail Knight (Robert Eddison) is mesmerizing in his brief part.If I was the make a list of my favourite action scenes in film, I swear my list would be dominated by scenes from the original Star Wars trilogy and its sister franchise. Sequences such as that on the circus train or in the belly the steel beast make such clever use of props and their surroundings. Last Crusade was one of the last blockbusters to have such extensive use of practical effects, you know, before CGI had to go and ruin everything. Two years later Terminator 2 was released and things would never be the same again. As for the film's music, the score by John Williams is not only one of his best but one of his most moving, perfectly capturing the melancholic and deep thematic nature of the film. I regularly listen to the movie's soundtrack in moments of personal reflection, it's that powerful.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is one of those rare films which gives me everything I could ask for in a motion picture. Like the filmmakers specifically made it just for me, encapsulating everything I love about cinema. The final shot of the four characters riding off into the sunset brings to an end to a decade of filmmaking like no other.",

Indy takes us on the ultimate treasure hunt that has more tension than even its two predecessors because of its chase element in the story. The addition of Sean Connery is also brilliant and adds a personal element that felt lacking in the previous two Indy film (not that they needed it because they're also kinda perfect).

            "content": "The opening sequence of this third Indiana Jones picture is the one part that really feels fresh, or rather, it recovers 1940s serial and magazine imagery that Spielberg hadn't used yet. The remainder of the film doesn't come as a revelation to Indy fans, but then how could it? The series by then had characterized a household universe of hazardous stunts, breathtaking chases, wry humor and the pursuit of ludicrous objects in extraordinary places.Raiders and Temple of Doom delineate the modern stamina for action-adventure films. They were a feverish revolution. But there was no way for Spielberg to outdo himself, and maybe it was for the best that Last Crusade was indeed supposed to be Indy's final film, and should've been. It will be heartbreaking watching the rejuvenated series age and tire out. Even in this third escapade, some of the basics are second-hand from Raiders. This time, Indy's mission is to locate the Holy Grail, which calls to mind the first movie's Ark of the Covenant, and both instances are race against Nazi villains.The new-fangled component this time is how Spielberg enhances some of Indy's backstory. We discover his real name and meet his father, Professor Henry Jones, played by Sean Connery at just the right pitch. Like the fathers of typical boys' stories, Dr. Jones is not a parent so much as a full-grown partner, an older chum who lacks full-bodied characterization because kids can't see their parents as intricate human beings. Perhaps we conjure up the Hardy Boys' father, who rolled his eyes and grinned at the activities of his endearing youngsters and maybe sporadically \"worried\" or \"advised them firmly.\" Because the Hardy Boys were always mixed up, at a green age, with a never-ending slew of fraudsters, hijackers, Nazi agents and robbers, their father's impassiveness was either transcendental or insane, and Connery enjoys himself with some of the same essentials.What Ford does looks so simple, so dry, that few other stars could keep such a square and poker-faced poise amid such pandemonium. After young Indy learns his life's mission in the early high point, the predominant plot is set after Raiders, when Henry Jones, the world's foremost Grail connoisseur, is snatched by bandits who are certain he knows where it's now hidden. He does. And Indy, working from Dad's notebook, trails from the States to the waterlogged burial chambers under Venice, and then to the barren regions of the Holy Land, where there is a fun chase including a formidable Nazi armored tank. He's escorted on his expedition by Dr. Elsa Schneider, an art historian he meets in Venice, but the character is a letdown after the fervor of Karen Allen in Raiders, and even the light-heartedness of Kate Capshaw's presence in Temple of Doom.As had been established as custom with those first two films, Spielberg sets up various set pieces of sophisticated workmanship. The art direction is terrific in a getaway from a zeppelin by airplane. If there's a tinge of disenchantment in this movie, it's because Spielberg simply couldn't reproduce the shock of endless inventiveness and dizzying energy. Raiders and Temple of Doom were a crossroads in the cinema of escapist entertainment, and there was no way Spielberg could make it crisp and fresh yet again.",

Then there are the greats - the ones that combine all of the above, and Nazi bad-guys. And they are called the Indiana Jones Trilogy. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a fantastic film. Temple of Doom is disappointing at best (although there are some great comedic moments - it just isn't in line with the other two films). The best, in my opinion, is Last Crusade. It isn't just that Harrison Ford and Sean Connery have such excellent on-screen chemistry as father and son. Or that the comedy bits are so fun. Nor the brilliant ending... No - what makes it so fantastic is that no film made since has even come close to being as good as this film in any respect. It is the pinnacle of \"scholarly\" action-adventure films. Sorry \"National Treasure\" and \"Sahara\" - you just don't stack up. \"DiVinci Code\" won't either. Take my advice - Netflix the Indiana Jones Trilogy and see for yourself.",

            "content": "I've always personally considered Steven Spielberg's 1989 blockbuster \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" to be the greatest sequel in the \"Indiana Jones\" series of films. It has the greatest charm, action sequences, special effects, and story of all the entries in the four-film series, after the first movie \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981). In this third entry, two-fisted globe-trotting archaeologist and adventure Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is once again racing against the Nazis for possession of an ancient religious artifact; this time it's the Holy Grail. And Jones is also bringing along his father, Professor Henry Jones (Sean Connery). Like its predecessor, the film's strength lies in its action sequences and charm, but there's also a much stronger emphasis on characterization, provided largely by the great interactions between co-stars Harrison Ford and Sean Connery. Spielberg's movies have always had a theme on the shaky relationships between fathers and their children, and this film plays on the strained relationship between Indiana Jones and his cantankerous father Henry Sr. It's a great dynamic that fuels the best and most impressive action sequences during \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\"10/10",

            "content": "Well, Spielberg realized that \"The temple of doom\" really sucked and luckily returned to the successful formula of the first one. But that's also the main downside to this movie; some scenes are done almost exactly like in \"Raiders\". The scene where Dr. Brody walks into the classroom and all the girls are drooling over Indy is done just like in the first movie and they could have fooled me. But let's get to the good stuff. 1. The dark theme from \"Raiders\" is back, but is sadly not heard often. 2. Excellent performance by River Phoenix as the young Indiana Jones. He was truly believable and I was sad that he was not given more screen time as the early part of the movie was really captivating. When he spots the golden cross and tells his friend to go get the professor his eyes look exactly like Ford's. 3. Sean Connery's performance was very memorable and different from his previous and future work; he is believable as the father and makes for some very funny moments in this movie. 4. Probably  many other things I don't remember at the moment but will as soon as I press the \"Now send your comments for approval\" button\nFord is great as usual, the special effects are OK and the story is interesting enough (the religion thing was also in \"Raiders\")A movie with a truly great cast and a high entertainment value, but lacks an innovative approach to the material.

            "content": "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the last of the 80's Indiana Jones and an adventure that more than matches any other like it that's out there. With fine performances throughout the good guys in this, The Last Crusade is truly one that is a well played out one, and also very funny. Does it match up to Raiders, well we will have to see as I write this review but be safe in the knowing this is thoroughly entertaining stuff. Harrison Ford is of course the man donning the whip and fedora again and is off on yet another quest, but this time it is his father he needs. In this film we are introduced to Indiana's father, Henry Jones Sr, who to Indiana's annoyance always calls him \"Junior\". Sean Connery is the actor stepping into the boots of Jones Sr and he makes a fantastic addition to the series, I'd even go as far to say he is the best new character in the series since well, Indiana Jones. As for rest of the cast it is Julian Glover who I wasn't so keen on, I wasn't sure if it was the poor accent or just the circumstances that happen but I just felt he was a little stale. Denholm Elliot as Dr Marcus Brody returns, this time he is maybe not in it as much as he could have been but is still a welcome return and an addition to a cast full of personality. Spielberg I feel is not at his absolute finest here, his direction can feel a little sticky at times, not that it is bad but just not as good as say Raiders. It is written fairly well, the script not maybe blowing me away in the more serious moments or even parts where it is downright ridiculous, but the comedy styling that is put upon Connery and Ford is one of the up most brilliance. It is that partnership between them that is one of the most immortalising things about this movie, the addition of Connery's character instantly makes this better and the workmanship between him and Harrison Ford is one that for me makes them two one of the best film duos's of all time.The effects are ramped up for this one, of course years had passed since the last two and the movie really knows how to utilize new found techniques. It is the explosions that for me are just better, this film is bigger than past seen, much more action means much more effects and it is great to see them used properly(and not overused either). Staying on the technical side of things the cinematography by Douglas Slocombe is still as ever marvellous, he just seems to know how to film an action adventure movie, never makes it boring angles, always quick but swift shots.So, is this addition in the Indian Jones movie collection the best? well that is a tough question. Raiders of the Lost Ark I know is a movie people find a special one, a movie that many consider their all time favourite, of any movie period. For me although I did watch Raiders and found it really good, I think the Last Crusade is too and deserves a place like Raiders in the heart of film fans, I don't think the Last Crusade is anything special that saying, but is still a highly entertaining piece of cinema and one I feel will endure for years to come.So overall the film is great, a movie I would recommend to anyone really as it contains a bit of everything, action, adventure but most importantly for me, it has laughter, this for me I can be sure of, is the funniest of the series. Sean Connery is the stand out performer in my opinion, maybe he even deserved awards for what he did here, and the chemistry here between father and son is one of great fun and great humour.",

On the way he'll need to negotiate a sewer full of rats (and petroleum), run away from the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, sleep with an evil (but hot) Nazi, impersonate a ticket inspector on a blimp, and as usual, do pretty much anything apart from archaeology. His main opponent here is Donovan, an evil collector obsessed with the grail legend.Harrison Ford returns to reprise his iconic role, and is joined by Sean Connery (Henry Jones), fresh off an Oscar win for the Untouchables, and former Bond villain Julian Glover (Donavan!), with Denholm Elliott making a welcome return as Marcus Brody after missing Temple of Doom. Alison Doody is also OK as the ill fated Elsa, easily the most interesting character of the female love interests in the three films. Doody wasn't much of an actress, but at least she's Irish.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was the only one I saw in the cinemas, and as an 8 year old, I was very excited.

As I did, I could not help thinking, how would this movie been received if the first two Indiana Jones movies had never been made? It is very difficult to follow the lead in a trilogy, as we saw in 'Back to the Future', for example. But my answer to myself was, 'The Last Crusade' is superb no matter what. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' will always remain my favorite of the trilogy, but 'Last Crusade' is just a small fraction of a mini-step behind. Sean Connery's role as Indy's father, Dr Jones, works perfectly. And the opening sequences with River Phoenix as the young Indy, showing us how he got the scar on his chin, plus his trademark hat, are very fitting to the whole movie. Even though the adventure becomes the search for the chalice, it is really the father and son searching for the relationship they somehow missed as Indy grew up.As we expected the DVD is absolutely superb. Colors are accurate and rich, and the video bit rate is almost 'Superbit' quality. The Dolby 5.1 sound with the John Williams score is a perfect complement. Just one, fine adventure movie!Main cast ... Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones , Sean Connery as Professor Henry Jones , Denholm Elliott as Dr. Marcus Brody, Alison Doody (an Irish lady) as Dr. Elsa Schneider , John Rhys-Davies as Sallah , and River Phoenix as Young Indy .Update: Dec 2016 - watched it again after 14 years, so much of it was fresh again, and thoroughly enjoyable.Update: Sept 2020 - We watched it again, still a very entertaining adventure movie.SPOILERS follow, for my own reference, please read no further.Young Indy as a Boy Scout in Utah (Arches Nat'l Park) finds a relic-robber discovering an antiquity, captures it for placing in a museum, is chased, on a train, the lion's car, bullwhip nicks his chin, thus the scar, eventually escapes, gets home, but the police are waiting for him, the explorer gets his antiquity back, gives young Indy the hat that will become his trademark, sees the foreigner who is buying the antiquity. Cut to modern times, ship at sea, Indy is recapturing the same antiquity from the same foreigner, he jumps, ship explodes, back in the classroom, shows Marcus Brody the recovered prize. Strangers recruit him for a mission to find the chalice that Christ used at the Last Supper, he balks, finds out his dad (Connery) was their hire but now missing. Dad's diary had been mailed to him from Venice, he heads there, the real adventure begins. Ends where the chalice is, guarded 700 years by an old knight, dad is shot by the bad guy, Indy has to get chalice to save him.",

Aside from that, this also features one of my favorite sites in the whole Middle East. Just watch and see what I mean. For me, this is one of the better father-son movies. Sure they fight a lot but what parent-child duo doesn't? Maybe they should play this movie more on Father's Day. That would prove that not all father-son relationships are as bad as they seem. As for me, this is my favorite Indiana Jones movie. A lot of the actors from Star Wars are in here, including Julian Glover (who played General Veers), Harrison Ford (Han Solo!), and the late Michael Sheard (who played the first guy Darth Vader strangled in The Empire Strikes Back).

            "review_title": "Disappointing",
            "content": "I loved the first two films of the Indiana Jones trilogy and was extremely disappointed with this one when it first came out, for several reasons. First of all, the opening is one of the most contrived and unbelievable things I've ever seen.  It's as if the producers said, \"Okay, we need a way for young I.J. to find his hat, his whip, the scar on his chin, the way he dresses, his fear of snakes, and his search for adventure all in ten minutes!\"Some of the special effects in this film are horrible--there is no explanation for the pathetic giant B-movie snake that opens its mouth and attacks young Indy.  Sometimes the camera angles aren't wide enough, either. The fake-looking rhino that rams it's horn into the roof is shot way too close.  This is also true of some of the scenes inside the tank, later. The angles are so tight you can only get a  vague idea of what's going on.In accordance with the first two films, I don't buy the relationship with Indy and his father.  He never mentions his father in the other films (because the writers hadn't thought of him yet) and in \"Raiders,\" Indy mentions his mother to Marcus.  It is stated in this movie that she died while Indy was young.  Indy's character seems slightly different in this movie as opposed to the other films.  Marcus Brody, an intelligent and interesting (although short on screen time) character in \"Raiders\" is reduced to a goof-ball who clowns around and gets into trouble for humor's sake.My biggest complaint with \"Last Crusade\" is its lack of punch as a supposed thrill-packed adventure film.  It is extremely lacking in almost every aspect.  Every action scene is over almost as quickly as it had started. Indy and his father get out of everything way too easily, whether it be landing a plane, boat chases, correctly selecting the right grail, or escaping Nazi-war planes.  The tank battle sequence is the most impressive of the movie, although it is lackluster compared to anything in \"Raiders\" or \"Temple of Doom.\"  Vogel makes a pretty nasty Nazi, but the rest of the villains are boring.  Donovan is just another traitorous man in a suit, strait out of a television murder mystery.  Ilsa isn't very vicious as a villain, or charismatic as a love interest.  Kazim just spouts prophecies at Indy on the brink of death.  Where are great villains like Belloq, Toht, or Mola Ram when you need them?The movie does insult your intelligence more than the other two.  For example, why does Vogel fire a pistol at Indy while he's inside a TANK? Why does Donovan drink from the first grail before anyone else does, without testing it on anyone first, and why does he take Ilsa's word?  \"Shooting ME won't get you anywhere,\" Indy contrivedly tells Donovan, giving the villain the opportunity to shoot his father.  While both of the first films had magic and supernatural elements, the scene at the end with the 1000 year old crusader really pushes it.I recently watched this film with a close friend, a fan of the first two who hadn't seen \"Crusade\" yet.  Halfway through it, he turned to me and said, \"Let's watch one of the other ones.\"  That would have been a good idea.",

This one has Indiana looking for the Holy Grail...the villains, once again it is the Nazis.  This one starts out with kind of an earlier Jones adventure with the late River Phoenix as the young Indiana Jones taking an artifact from this tomb raiders cause as Indy says, \"it belongs in a museum\".  Then the story flash forwards to him trying to recover the same artifact.  Then he goes after the Holy Grail because his father has disappeared while looking for it.  This leads Indy to Venice then to a castle in, I think, Austria where he finds his dad a prisoner of the Nazis. After they get away they have to go into the heart of Germany to retrieve a book that will help them get through traps that protect the Holy Grail. They take a zephyr and there is a cool bi-plane fight and then it is off to a Middle Eastern country to find the grail.  The trap scenes are cool and there is a great tank scene before the traps.  Then comes the only complaint I have and that is the chamber with the Holy Grail...the guy guarding it was a bit lame.  Other than that though, this was a really great movie.",

            "content": "Before even the days of \"Raiders Of The Ark\", Spielberg had expressed an interest in making a James Bond movie but he couldn't get the go-ahead from Bond producer Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli. Indy was just as good an opportunity for him, though, and who better to cast as Indy's father than (the original) James Bond himself? It's actually through the casting choice of Sean Connery that this third installment of Indy's adventures really takes flight and silences the critics of \"The Temple Of Doom\". In his third outing, Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) goes in search of his father, Prof. Henry Jones Sr (Sean Connery) who mysteriously disappeared while searching for the Holy Grail. Once again, though, the Nazi's are also in tow. After losing on the Ark of the Covenant, they too want to get their hands on the Cup of Christ. By the time of this films release everybody was fully aware of Indiana Jones. With only two films under his fedora, every woman wanted him and every man wanted to be him; Indy had already become an icon of American cinema. With a fond familiarity, people welcomed him into their homes and that's the very reason why the opening of this third installment is such a joy. It's depiction of Indy in his youth is wonderful addition to his backstory and the late great River Phoenix does an excellent job in capturing Ford's mannerisms. We learn of his use of the whip and the resulting scar on his chin. We also get an insight into the procurement of his famous fedora and how his unusual name of \"Indiana\" originated from the family dog... (It was actually George Lucas' dog that was named Indiana and it also served as the inspiration for Chewbacca in \"Star Wars\"). After being heavily criticized for his dark tone in \"Temple of Doom\", Spielberg finds his lighter side again and delivers the funniest and most gleefully entertaining of Indy's adventures. The likes of Denholm Elliott and John Rhys Davies return from Raiders with more fleshed out comical roles but, as mentioned, it's the great interplay between Ford and Connery that's the biggest draw to here. The chemistry between them anchors a poignant family adventure while providing numerous father/son comedic moments. Like the previous two, though, there's no shortest of nail-biting action as World War II is on the brink and the Nazi's are once again Indy's foes and gives Spielberg another chance to put the Third Reich to the test. \"Schindler's List\" and \"Saving Private Ryan\" are obviously his more personal films on the subject but with Indy he gets the chance to have fun with them again, leaving this third installment with more in common with \"Raiders\" as well as honing in on the biblical aspects of the story. Out goes the Ark and in comes the coveted Holy Grail and while the fourth film in the franchise - \"The Kingdom Of The Crystal\" - explores a misjudged science-fiction element, it confirms that Indy's adventures are better left in the paths of the religious or the occult. Raiders may still be the absolute classic of them all but it's hard to give a film with as much excitement and entertainment as this, anything less than top marks.",

            "content": "Surprisingly, 'Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade (1989)' is perhaps more fun than 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981)', even if it isn't quite as good from a narrative point of view. For a little while, the piece gives off a major sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, being structurally similar to the first film in its series to the point that it almost seems like the same script with different set-pieces. However, once Connery's Henry Jones Sr. comes into play, the picture takes on a life all of its own. It's remarkably funny, the banter between father and son driving most of its comedy as well as its character. It's also remarkably exciting, with large-scale but still personal action sequences peppered throughout the gleefully globetrotting adventure. In many ways, it feels like the true sequel to 'Raiders', leaving 'Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom (1984)' as the 'odd one out' in the franchise. In many ways, the movie seems like Spielberg is trying to atone for the criticism of that much darker picture (he has said himself that it was one of the reasons he made this third outing). Even though 'Temple' isn't quite as dark as everyone makes out, it certainly lacks the smile-inducing, adventure serial vibe of its peers. 'Crusade' feels like the true successor to 'Raiders', going back to a delightful, almost hammy tone. It thrives because of it. The filmmakers know what's most important, keeping things fun and fast-paced. They also imbue each and every action beat with oodles of character, something that the flick in general has an abundance of. Its core relationship is especially satisfying, a fairly nuanced and endearing take on the 'estranged father' trope. By the time it's over, you'll have laughed, you'll have cried, you'll have been on the edge of your seat and you'll still have a beaming smile on your face. The experience is highly enjoyable. In fact, it's almost perfect. 9/10",

Indy teams up with Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) to search for Indy's father in Italy. From there, the rescue mission turns into a race to find the Holy Grail before it ends up in the hands of the Nazis. What results is nothing short of total excitement and adventure. It is one death-defying mission, with rat-infested caves, merciless Hitler loyalties, daring plane rides and exciting battle scenes. For the story and screenplay, I've found to be one of the most captivating movie plots - attention grabbing and having satisfying entertainment from start to finish. Steven Spielberg gave solid direction to the story with one of the most memorable cast ever assembled. I loved the chemistry and father-son relationship between Indiana Jones and his father as it added to the character development and overall substance in the film. Julian Glover makes a devious and great villain, and Allison Doody provided a nice touch of romance and mystery to the story. And, kudos to the special effects team for its spectacular work in turning the movie into an action-packed and a wild, adventurous ride. Above all, a great, exciting, dramatic and humorous film with great direction by Steven Spielberg, intriguing story by Menno Meyjes and George Lucus and a rousing music score by John Williams.

            "review_title": "A fun and whimsical adventure full of heart, humour and character",
            "content": "After the dark and nihilistic Temple of Doom, this franchise returned to form in a big way with an enjoyable and exciting plot, stylish direction, a real sense of warmth and the best cast performance in any of these films.The film opens differently from the first two, with a prequel prologue that is set up gradually. This sequence is an example of virtuoso visual storytelling, with very little dialogue and the story being told through a montage of David Lean inspired wide and epic landscape shots. It builds towards a superb and highly amusing action adventure sequence that very cleverly adds some character development to Indiana Jones, well played at this stage by the late River Phoenix. It then segues forward some 25 years with a very clever cut to the Harrison Ford incarnation.The strength of this story (a collaboration between George Lucas, Spielberg, and writers Menno Meyjes and Jeffery Boam, with no doubt significant input from Connery and Ford) is the Indiana Jones character finding his estranged father, played in a tour de force performance by Sean Connery. While there is the obligatory search for a lost artifact, in this case the Holy Grail, this search is the secondary plot, with the interplay between father and son becoming the primary plot. Despite just a 12 year difference in ages between Ford and Connery, their interplay works brilliantly and is the genuine heart of the movie. This powerful emotional connection between these characters is an ingredient that is missing from the previous two films and really brings this audience into the story. While the set pieces don't have the same level of ingenuity, relentless pace or sheer film-making bravado as Raiders of the Lost Ark,the film is far more character based, light hearted and emotionally involving than the previous two outings. The film maintains interest in these acting sequences thanks to wonderful performances. While Connery and Ford do dominate the proceedings, Denholm Elliot and Jonathan Rhys Davis offer excellent support again. Irish actress Alison Doody is highly amusing as Elsa Schneider, and it is a shame that her career didn't take off after this film the way it should have done. Veteran British actors Michael Byrne and Julian Glover have fun with their roles, and Byrne in particular is given some pithy one liners. The story builds neatly to a clever and powerful climax, leading to a warm and amusing coda at the end of the movie.Technically the film as accomplished as usual. However, the more character driven nature of the story means that visual effects take much more of a back seat in this film, and ILMs work is more subtle and understated in this film, making use of mainly traditional optical techniques and on set live special effects, with the one exception of a very well realised effect at the films climax which involved the use of stop motion combined the morphing technology overseen by ILM digital pioneers Doug Smythe and Les Dittert. The films centrepiece, a major action sequence set in the desert using horses, trucks, cars and a tank is carried off with usual Spielberg bravado and style, and works due to the audience following what the characters are doing, rather than the set piece itself. Kudos to Oscar winning special effects supervisor George Gibbs, second unit director Michael Moore and editor Michael Kahn and producer George Lucas (who also helped out with the editing) for making the action sequences look so polished and convincing. Spielberg even manages to insert little gems of witty dialogue and some terrific visual gags into the action, particularly one involving Indiana Jones incredulous reaction to using a Luger revolver. They work so well because they fit the situation the characters are in. The sound work is first rate, and Ben Burtt and Richard Hymns won Oscars for their sound effects. What is impressive is that because the sound helps convince you are right there with what is going on, rather than being loud and in your face. Burtt had already won Academy awards for his work on Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark and ET. He has continued to work on a wide body of work since and is still one of Hollywood top artists in this area. Richard Hymns, after winning this first Academy Award, went on to win again in this area for Jurassic Park and Saving Private Ryan and has also worked on a series of high profile films including Avatar. Douglas Slocombe's photography is more understated this time around, but still stylish. The film seems to make a statement that it is the characters rather than the action which is to the forefront, and indicates a maturing of the franchise. John Williams score is, as usual first rate, but is more spiritual, emotional and deft in style, compared with the more militaristic and aggressively visceral style of the previous films.In summary congratulations to all the key collaborators for a warm and thoroughly enjoyable adventure, though particular mention needs to go to Spielberg, Connery and Ford for taking the series and in welcome and involving new direction.",

            "content": "\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" closes the trilogy of the 1980's movie with Harrison Ford playing the lead character a professor of Archeology involved in incredible adventures purchasing mythical objects and things like that. It ended very well until Spielberg returns with another adventure in 2008, good but without the atmosphere of dreams people had in the 1980's. In this one Indy is contacted by a millionaire (Julian Glover) to find the Holy Grail or most known as the cup from where Jesus drank-ed during the Last Supper. In the Grail contains a powerful water that can give eternal life for the one who drinks of it. Indy is reluctant but after he finds out that his father (Sean Connery) is missing after trying to go after the Grail, Jones embarks along with his friend and chief Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) and Dr. Elsa Schneider (Allison Doody) in the rescue of the Grail and Indy's father. And of course they're gonna encounter lots of fun and adventure fighting villains, Nazists and even get a book signed by Adolf Hitler. Most people admires this movie so much because of the introduction of Sean Connery to the series which added so much humor, intelligence and along with Harrison they form a great team together. People are right on this matter. Is definitely the best film of all four, not only because of that, but because it's fluency in presenting the characters without much talk and developing fantastic action sequences and funny moments are everything well made. Also it's Spielberg's favorite in the series. Before the adventure begins audience will found out how Indy got his scar on the chin, why all the fear of snakes and his taste for dangerous things. Young Indy is presented to audiences in the figure of River Phoenix in one of the most memorable sequences of the series where he fights a bunch of guys trying to protect a treasure. For those who can't figure out how he got out of the box remember: It was a magical box! He could go to anywhere on the train just entering in that and that's it. The CGI effects in some parts are very dated and you can see some of the \"flaws\" (the scene with the war tank falling and Michael Byrne's character is screaming you'll notice a thin line on his side showing that the image was added by computers); at other moments you won't notice anything but still it is a fabulous film to see and enjoy and watch over and over again.My favorite moments are: all the escape Indy and Jones Father have to do (the scene in the airplane is most funny ever when old Mr. Jones didn't know to operate a gun and end up shooting on the tail of their own plane); the chase with the war tank (some funny moments with Marcus Brody character); the Holy Grail appearance (there's a great and subtle moral about how simplicity always win in the end of a matter, simple is safe). The whole package is wonderful. Another great example of what is missing in today's films that are filled with marvelous visual effects but lack with a great story, great acting and that fantasy thing that makes us enjoy the movie in its entirely. Spielberg and Ford got it right again with this film but I wished that the series could ended here, with the scene of the team along with Salah (John Rhys-Davies) riding into the sunset. That was a very good conclusion but the rest is history and one more film were included along with the excellent trilogy. 10/10",

As the same with the other Indiana Jones movies this one follows the same format. Indiana with a sidekick and woman in tow goes to find an archaeological treasure of importance. The difference between this movie and the others is that this time there is a father-son aspect that was not present in the others and this was a brilliant move on part of the producers and director Steven Spielberg.

It bought back the action adventure elements that were missing in Temple of Doom and made this so fun and entertaining to watch. Along with the classic action sequences there was still plenty of room for the comedy that you expect in the series and it delivered a lot more that the previous film, as the first one did. Plot wise, it took an approach more similar to that of Raiders of the Lost Arc, which i found to be a very interesting and engaging plot. At some points it did feel like i had seen similar things in the first film but it was for the most part full of fresh new ideas, better comedy and surprise twists. The best thing about this film had to be the addition as Sean Connery as Dr. Henry Jones, and his amazing chemistry with his son Indiana Jones. These two really led the movie for the last two thirds and they only made it better. Their relationship was entertaining, funny, and felt really natural. Once again John Williams with another great score that can instantly improve any film with its classic, memorable songs. In the end Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade brings this series back to the tomb raiding that made the first film so memorable and provides another fantastic action adventure film that anyone can enjoy. - 8.7",

But now, after seeing this film on the big screen, it doesn't matter!This whole film is a filmed comic book \u0096 the Nazis are supposed to be cartoonish; the violence is not real, the situations are totally impossible \u0096 but that doesn't mean that it is any less a great film.Once again Indiana Jones fights the ideology that is the Nazis\u0085 and, of course, wins.He has the requisite number of close escapes and near-death experiences that allows the viewer to suspend the plot holes and lapses in continuity that are rampant in this truly one-of-a-kind film.Harrison Ford could not have been better cast as Indiana Jones (you will find out how he got his name in this installment) and he takes the story and runs with it.Sean Connery is incredible as his father \u0096 the real humour starts the first time he appears on the screen.There is amazing attention to detail (note the name of the ship that Indy is trapped on in the opening sequence) and the characters are actually fully developed and finely drawn.Allison Doody (who could live with a name like that?) makes her last major screen appearance as the evil Dr Elsa Schneider \u0096 what happened to her and where is she now?This, apparently the last of the Indiana Jones films, is not exactly the best way to finish a franchise \u0096 but it could be much worse.

In fact, the team formed by Ford and Connery is unstoppable and gives pleasure to see how professional is their interaction on screen. There are two established actors, Ford is very well suited with his role and Connery is a veteran with decades of experience and versatility. This clearly benefited the film, where these two artists outshines the rest of the cast, especially in humor moments, tearing laughter to the public.

The final sequences, filmed in one of the most stunning scenery I know - the Nabataean ruins of Petra in Jordan - are worthy of staying in memory of any movie lover. The photography is excellent, the visual and sound effects have great quality, some costumes were very well thought out and the soundtrack, not surprisingly, has fulfilled her role.It's no coincidence that there is a division on what is the best movie of this franchise: \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" or this one.

In his third adventure, whip- smart archaeologist Indiana Jones has to rescue his dad rather than a damsel in enduring distress, a cunning ploy that deserves a tip of the fedora to those shrewd storytellers \u2013 a certain Mr. Steven Spielberg and Mr. George Lucas.Opening with a fantastic prologue revolving around one of Indy's early escapades, the movie immediately takes us to 1938, when Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) discovers that his curmudgeonly father Henry Jones (Sean Connery) has disappeared while tracking the Holy Grail - the cup that legend holds Jesus used at the Last Supper and now contains his blood. But as we soon find out, he is not alone in his quest. He has company in American millionaire Walter Donovan, who believes that a drink from the cup will confer immortality and a slew of Nazis who will kill anyone to win the prize. Soon we find Indy travel halfway around the world to swash-buckle his way through a company of Nazi brutes, to unite with his tweedy, mildly befuddled father. The duo teams up to begin Indiana's last crusade, as they endlessly elude the Nazis in race to capture the Holy Grail. Can the father-son duo save one of the world's most precious relics from Hitler's minions?Steven Spielberg has the truest instincts for keeping an audience visually engaged and at his natural command of the simple mechanics of storytelling, it enables him to evoke a kind of pop transcendence that comes close to the effect of the higher, classical arts. Here, he delivers the action with breathless enthusiasm in a movie bursting with thrilling action set-pieces - Indy discovers catacombs, sways through rat-infested tunnels, finds himself right beside the Fuhrer and even manages to reach the coveted Holy Grail, making the pursuit wonderfully perilous.But it's not the relentless action that you eventually prize in this lavishly executed entertainment. It is the amazing chemistry between its two lead actors that makes it so thoroughly entertaining, never allowing the film to lose sight of the contentious but charming relationship between Indiana and his father. As soon as Connery's Henry welcomes his son's first rescue attempt by addressing him as Junior and they discover they have bedded the same gorgeous Nazi spy, the right note of cantankerousness and grudging affection on both sides is struck. Connery playing against type as a book-wormy professor is solid-gold as Indy's crotchety father. He also brings out the very best in Ford, who is at his charming best as the rugged, macho Indy. The snappy by-play between them adds a wonderful facet to the adventure and together, their timing is impeccable.When Steven Spielberg takes off his serious hat and channels his inner-child, there's no one better at making sheer entertainment. And that is what Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is - pure entertainment!",

The hot babe this time is Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), while Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies return as Marcus Brody and Sallah, respectively. My favorite scene?

I know I'm supposed to be tickled to death by Sean Connery's fussy curmudgeon, but I just found him to be tedious instead. I do, however, like the opening scene, that shows River Phoenix playing a young Indiana Jones at the beginning of his adventurous career.Grade: B-",

            "content": "When I was a kid I was absolutely obsessed with Indiana Jones, it's one of the only franchises where my original impressions when I was young still Rings true to this day, when I first watch all the movies, this was my favourite of the 4 and to this day The Last Crusade is still my favourite entry in the series. One thing I feel this movie does better than any other movie in the franchise is how it characterises Indiana Jones, we actually learn a lot about him in this movie, the opening Flashback was a great way to set up what we've been lead to believe about him and it does this without dialogue but with actions that lets you take it in more. I also adored the inclusion of his father in this movie, Sean Connery and Harrison Ford played of teach other perfectly, it was such a good way to humanise his character and give him some extra vulnerability that he didn't have in the first two films. The set pieces in this film are still absolutely phenomenal, they still hold up to this day. The tank and motorcycle chases still look great, they had real stakes and tension to them because you realise that they were filmed to be practical and realistic and like the past two, Jones isn't a perfect fighter and only just manages to get out of it. But the best set piece in the film is the trials for the holy grail at the climax. It was so good to see Jones use his mind to accomplish his goal rather than with his physical abilities, because of this there was so much tension due to the fact that you didn't know how he was going to get through it. The tone in this movie is perfect, it never feels muddled or conflicted. Large portions of The Last Crusade are hilarious, they integrate comedy into tense moments and it always feels consistent and just makes this film so much more enjoyable. Another thing I love about this movie is that it still has room more those more mature scenes, not necessarily dark but the tone can often shift to being a bit more sombre to suit more character building scenes and it's done so well. The main quest in this movie is my favourite one in large part due to the personal connection they gave it. They set it up as something Sean Connery's character has been searching for over his life and it gets you more invested in where it's going because of that. They use the fact that it will fall into Nazi hands if they don't find it first but it's not as effective a motivator as the emotional connection they gave it to Indy and his father. This has been and will always be one of my favourite movies, it's just Indiana Jones at his best. It's incredibly fun but still heartfelt, it takes lengths to develop the protagonist more and has a quest that the viewer can get more invested in. This (as well as the other 3 entries) is my childhood film that will always be with me. 10/10: A+ (Incredible)",

Sean Connery is marvellous as Indy's Dad Dr Henry Jones. Their scenes together are an absolute joy. Despite only twelve years between them, they are totally believable as father and son, with Connery displaying a talent for comedy that few would have guessed at, and it seems to bring the best out in Ford. I enjoyed the beginning with River Pheonix (another spot of superb casting) as a young Indy too, giving us a bit of back story to our hero. The comedy in this one hits the spot perfectly, unlike in the last instalment. The wonderful Denholm Elliot is brilliant (in his first role since discovering he had AIDS) as Marcus Brody and John Rhys Davies is excellent returning for the last time as Sallah. All of that and I've not mentioned the score. John Williams does it again. His Indiana Jones 'Theme' is as iconic as his Jaws, Superman and Star Wars ones. Brings a smile to my face whenever I hear it. There are some obvious stunt doubles and a bit of ropey CGI, but that really is nitpicking and is hard to criticise a movie that gets so much right. But for me this is all about the father/son relationship at the heart of the movie, and since like Indy, I had a hard time communicating with my Dad, that I relate so much. Their bickering, The little looks (especially during the bike chase scene) at each other and throw in the slap for blasphemy, it is what makes this movie so good. With it's great ending, this would have been a superb end to the trilogy. In the end we got the awful next movie. I'm sure I'm not the first reviewer to say this, but If James Bond did have a son. It would have been Indiana Jones.",

            "review_title": "The Perfect Indy Formula",
            "content": "\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" established the Indiana Jones franchise as the standard for action/adventure on the big screen. \"Temple of Doom\" proved that the films could also have a sense of humor. \"The Last Crusade\" melds both of those elements together, creating the perfect formula for an Indiana Jones film and making it the best of the lot in the process.For a basic plot summary, \"Last Crusade\" sees Indy (Harrison Ford) initially dealing with the capture of his father, Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery), by the Nazis. Indy quickly discovers that the ultimate prize is the literal Holy Grail of biblical lore, which Papa Jones had an almost single- minded devotion towards finding.The most easily-identifiable reason for the rousing success of \"Last Crusade\" is the chemistry between Ford & Connery, which steals every scene they are in together (a considerable portion of the film). Indy was never supposed to be a superhero-type figure (just an archaeologist with a penchant for adventure), so having a father (one who even saddles him with childish nicknames, no less!) really serves to humanize the character even further. Also, each Indy film needs someone to play against Indy's straight-arrow personality towards discovery, and Connery is absolutely perfect in that role. The banter between the two is pure cinema gold!I think the film is also helped by a move towards more \"traditional archaeology pursuits\", so to speak, after the Indian mysticism of \"Temple of Doom\". Not that \"Temple\" was a bad film by any means, but I think the Indy formula works a bit better if the \"pot of gold at the end of the rainbow\" is a bit more identifiable. The quest for the Holy Grail fits this mantra perfectly, and sets up perhaps the best sequence of the entire Indy series (progressing through the three traps set to protect the Grail).Another remarkable aspect of \"Last Crusade\"? The initial \"Indy as a kid\" (played by River Phoenix) section, meant to promote a spin-off that never reach much critical acclaim, should have probably been nothing more than a money-grab. However, probably thanks to Spielberg's directing, even that material is thrilling and adds depth to the Indy character.Overall, \"Last Crusade\" is my favorite of all the Indiana Jones films for the way it combines all the best aspects of adventuring filmmaking. As far as I am concerned, this is the true creative ending to the Indy saga. There is a great quote from Spielberg noting \"There's a reason we had Indy riding off into the sunset for the final scene\". After the embarrassment of \"Crystal Skull\" many years later, perhaps a future \"Indy 5\" will get things back on track creatively. Until that time, though, Indy will always be first and foremost a trilogy to me, with \"Last Crusade\" shining brightest at the top of the pyramid.",

            "content": "Spielberg was well inspired again and anew after the badly thought second episode and he brought his Indiana Jones back to the Nazi time and context. It's clear and some of the scenes, including the meeting with Adolf Hitler himself are sickeningly obnoxious and hilariously crystal clear: Hitler is evil, he burns books, he kills people, he enjoys it and he is surrounded by the scum of humanity. But Spielberg goes one iota further and introduces his version of the American Nazi and this one is worse than Adolf Hitler himself, he has no historical ambition or vision just plain personal and self centered egotistic interest. He is a Nazi out of pure opportunism and that is even worse evil than Nazism itself. But Spielberg gets to another dimension too by introducing Indiana Jones's father and Sean Connery does quite a credible father of that crazy adventurer, or should I say adventuring archaeology professor. But one improvement is never enough for our Spielberg and this time the main woman is an evil traitor, a Nazi that prefers dying to letting the prey of her hunt go, even when it is obviously too late and out of reach. And that prey is the Holy Grail, mind you. This time the myth is a good western myth, Christian what's more. And this myth needs a delicate treatment but has immense possibilities for us and these possibilities are used right to the end. So we discover the underground catacombs of Venice and their rats, a good old chase on a train transporting a circus and all its animals, a sacred temple in Jordan and all kinds of religious symbols and traps, and the winners are those who believe in and respect these symbols, and that has to be Indiana Jones and his father. Too bad for all the others: the treasure hunter who takes the most beautiful and golden chalice and dies on the spot after drinking from it, the greedy woman who disappears in the depth of the earth, and all the other bad guys and bad boys. Some scene are superb like the crazy German tank in the desert. Every detail is hilarious and suspenseful and even a second viewing, or probably even more, is as effective as the first one. Very well inspired indeed this time, this famous Spielberg, but since he made Dr Jones Senior drink the water of eternal life in the Holy Grail itself, he is doomed to go on and on with that legend. The fourth episode has already been produced and Harrison Ford has just announced a few days ago he was ready to get into the adventure of a fifth episode, now he has been provided with a son in this fourth episode: he has to guide the new Junior into the next stage of the quest.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 12 Cr\u00e9teil, CEGID",

            "content": "While not my favorite in the Indiana Jones trilogy, The Last Crusade is a significant improvement over Temple of Doom (one might almost say you need Doom to get to Crusade, to go back to the greatness of Raiders), and it acts as as much a matin\u00e9e-serial style action picture while also having a bit akin with a James Bond picture. This is actually as much to do with how Steven Spielberg and George Lucas craft the story, villains (including sexy femme fatale), and the action set pieces as it does with the casting of Sean Connery as Harrison Ford's father. There are of course some amazing set pieces of chases, fights, and all encompassing with a nice fast pace. This time, however, there is a bit more mystery and intensity I'd put more with one of Connery's films than the 1930's serials. This is also not at all a crutch to the film- if anything, Ford and Connery are what really make the film work a lot better then in would without, for they work so well off of each other, with enough comedy sometimes just based on a glance or a look from the older icon to the younger star. Starting with an swift and over-the-top beginning with a young Indiana Jones (with a good River Phoenix in the role), the story shifts gears and goes into, well, the religious. One may remember an ark of the covenant as the set piece in the first film, so this time we're given the holy grail itself, giving immortality to anyone who drinks from the cup. At this point in the story, and other points, it could be easy for the filmmakers to dip into some religious ballyhoo. Luckily, it doesn't go too deep into that, as the side of the antagonists- the Nazi's (watch for a funny moment involving, of all people in a Spielberg picture, Hitler) and an American entrepreneur- and in the adventure that ensues through the desert. Capped off with one of the very best action pieces in the series, a chase involving a tank and the usual cliffhanger style, the movie does start to take a breather as it comes to a close, there are at least a few surprises (i.e. a certain death scene) in store - and, most impressive on repeat viewings, the 'Three Challenges' that Indiana Jones must face in this Biblical quest for the Grail. Boasting a sharp script and a gaining momentum that differs from the other films' non-stop action, it's definitely one of the more entertaining works of the power duo in the 80's.",

            "content": "This is one of my favorite films of all time and it's my second favorite in the Indiana Jones franchise.I really like the plotline which makes sense just as the Ark of the Covenant was a lost holy relic it makes sense that the Holy Grail would be next. This one is a little different because it's not just a matter of finding it but it's a race against evil, as they want the grail for nefarious purposes. The fact this evil force are the greatest scumbags in history the Nazis just more makes us want Indy and his fellow crusaders to win.The music is great, of course the score is by John Williams one of my favorite composers, this sequel has the usual trademark theme, but I like thought the film there are lots of memorable and beautiful scores. From the usual theme to certain other tracks like when the bad guys show up in the action and suspense sequences.The action is great there are a lot of fun memorable sequences. One of my favorites are the tank which to me is one of my favorite battles of all time. I really like how it's divided into steps almost like a level in a video game where in step one, Indiana has to find a way to get close and board the tank while trying not to get blown away, step two it becomes a moving platform battle as Indiana fights of some of the Nazi that board to get him off, and step three Indiana has to fight off the Nazi Colonel whom is like the boss of the level.But I also really love most of the suspenseful moments, from one really good sequence which was both suspenseful and funny where both Indy and his father Henry are in a stick situation that just goes from bad to worse as both are tied up on chairs and their trying to free themselves and get the heck out.\nEven the three challenges is great which is one of the most suspense sequences ever, I remember literally being on the edge of my seat and actually worrying for Indy's life as he is forced to go thought the deadly gauntlet of traps, with the three clues in the journal as his only defense. Like in one sequence when it got to the second challenge which is sort of like the board game \"Password\" only you can die if God Forbid you step on a wrong letter. Once I saw Indiana Jones about to make a mistake I remember yelling \"Noooo!\"But also, what really powers the film are both Indiana Jones and his father Henry. This really makes this film different from the other Indy films because this plays out a bit like a buddy cop film, which makes sense as the 80's were big with that subgenre with \"Lethal Weapon\" and others. Its kind of cool and fitting that Sean Connery plays Indy's dad as the actor is well known for playing the Iconic pulp hero James Bond, so James Bond is Indiana Jones dad, well sort of. However we don't see Sean doing any fighting, which makes sense story wise as Henry is an archaeologist but not a trained fighter like his son, but I like despite being an ordinary guy with ordinary powers he does hold his own against danger and helps his son out anyway he can, like any good father should.I really love the back and forth between both, it's sort of a bronze and brains relationship as Indiana is the one that does the most ass kick while Henry does the most thinking along the way. Really like seeing both clash with one another as both give each other grief intentionally though most of the time unintentionally, but also get along and work well with one another, much like the relations with our own parents. I also like how we see slight differences and similarities between both of them, which is true with all of us that have grown up with some similarities and traits of our parents but we significant differences which make both them and ourselves our own people.From the fact that both have a fascination with archaeology but Indiana's despite his knowledge in archelogy his approach is more direct, on the field and learning more along the way. Henry is a more laid-back approach as he knows more thoroughly he's a guy that sits down and takes his time researching and thinking before applying. I can emphasize with both these things as I feel I do a little of both.But what I really love about his film is it has heart; the film is sort of a Christian movie which is fitting as they are finding a lost artifact from the Christian faith. But it has some theme like in faith not so much in God but in yourself. Really like that we get a little of Indiana's stance in the Christian faith; he is a Christian but not a highly practiced one which is understandable as he's invested most of his time in his field of science Archaeology and with his expeditions it's not like he has time to go to church, let alone the fact wherever he goes it's not like there is a Church around.But also, about family as we see Indy throughout the adventure at the same time is mending his relationship with his father. Both have a bit of a strained relationship, most of this caused by Indy's father's lifelong pursuit of the grail which may have caused a certain amount of dissonance. We see some of that in the beginning of the film of a young Indy played well by the late River Phenix, that sequence was fun on it's own as it was way before the notion of prequels and was a bit of a set up for that TV series \"Young Indiana Jones\" which I feel is an under the radar gem.It's really touching as both throughout the adventure we see both actually growing closer, which makes us all the more care for both characters and hope both will succeed in both their mission and relationship with each other.Sometimes real treasure is closer than we think.Rating: 4 stars",

I loved every scene in this film including the chase scenes. I even liked the part when Donovan drinks the wrong grail and turning into a skeleton. It was almost like Donovan turning into a zombie. The final boss was Donovan's skeleton in Indiana Jones' Greatest Adventures and I played the game many times. The special effects of Donovan decaying and turning into the skeleton was great. The part that I liked was when Indy pushes Donovan's skeleton into the wall and it crumbles into pieces. They did a great job with the effects like always. I loved the ending when Indy and the rest ride off into the sunset. It is still the greatest classic for the franchise.10/10 starsRIP Sean Connery \ud83d\ude4f",

And this one..... well, it probably bombed at the box office now that I've seen this.For the third film, the creators add in a new character to the series: Indy's father, played by Sean Connery.  Unfortunately, this idiot, although a better archeologist than \"Jr.,\" as he calls his son, winds up tripping the traps that Indiana does his best to avoid.  He basically screws up nearly everything they try to do.  I guess the writers decided he would make a great comic relief.  He doesn't.  And that look on Harrison Ford's face... it looks like he just wants this nightmare to end as soon as possible.  He looks really bored.  He just doesn't have the same magic he did when he first donned the hat eight years before.  What a shame.  Too bad the upcoming DVD contains all three films, including this one.BOTTOM LINE:  Thanks a lot, Jones Sr.  Bow down so I can belt you one, and then take your place along with other franchise enders, like Jar Jar Binks and the Ewoks.",

            "content": "The spiritual or archaeological concept for this third Indy movie is too close of the first one and thus lacks the originality of the second. It's again Bible, Desert and Nazis! To not discriminate, after Judaism and Christianity, the fifth movie should deal about Islam! It would be a perilous journey but an interesting one (read \"Last Patriot\" from Brad Thor for a try!).Fortunately, Spielberg saves the movie first by incorporating a father-son relationship and second by choosing Sean Connery to play the father!. On top of this, you have a delicious femme fatal, a really lunatic Marcus Brody and a colossal soundtrack from John Williams! If my memories are accurate, it was this summer of 1989 that rooted my passion (=autonomy) for movies and soundtracks with such parallel releases of Batman, Abyss, ST5, Ghosbusters2, BTF2! It was tied with my passion with comics too and i remember to read the black and white adaptation of this Indy with the K7 of the score! Thus, Internet and DVD aren't the ultimate entertainment and it's the proof that imagination is the most vital ingredient! If i don't write it now and here, i will never write it anywhere else: i have always found that my father looks like and behaves like Sean Connery. I'm sure he would be like the comparison but i doubt that someday I will tell it or that he will read this review. On my side, i'am not a Junior as well, despite like Indy, I get into troubles to stand for what seems right and to communicate with my father!

Jones searches for the Holy Grail as instructed in his father's diary. Eventually he rescues his father who was a prisoner to the Nazis who also search for the Grail. This leads to exhilarating action sequences involving blimps, airplanes and tanks. The production is top notch and director Steven Spielberg does a fantastic job but Raiders of the Lost Ark remains the best of the series. Harrison Ford has the role of Jones down to a tee. Sean Connery as Senior Jones often takes the humour into overplay, which hinders much of his scenes despite the character as a terrific role. River Phoenix appears as young Jones presents a great opening where he narrowly escapes death but discovers his calling. Alison Doody is the villainess who plays Jones through and through until her aim for possessions becomes more important than her own life. The role is as bland as cardboard. John Rhys Davies makes an appearance from the superior Raiders of the Lost Ark. Light hearted with a father son theme to underline it all but the point is clearly that of entertainment and on that note the film works wonderfully, with a little comic intrusion for good measure.

Sean Connery is great as Henry Jones, and he's hialrious too.  True, there is a lot of humour in this film, which can sometimes detract from the excitement, but the overall effect is fun and thrills.  Though not as impressively executed as Raiders, with some effects that are actually worse, the film is still a perfect demonstration of Spielberg's direction (e.g. the shadow turning on the blimp signalling to Indy that the blimp is heading back for Germany ).  Overall, a reliable choice that deserves a place in your video library beside Raiders. 9/10",

The acting is brilliant in the film, and usually Indy would be the scene stealer like the first two, but no Indy's father Henry Jones steals every scene that they are in, Sean Connery did a spectacular performance, literally his second best Performance of his career (right behind James Bond of Course), he is hilarious resourceful and truthfully he deserved an Oscar Nomination for his performance in this film it's that good. The Villain in this film Walter Donovan is the second best Villain in the Trilogy (not counting Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) right behind Rene Belloq, and that is awesome, the story in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is incredible, and finally the soundtrack is amazing.

Harrison Ford is the same old gutsy Indiana Jones and he plays the archaeologist like if it was a second skin.But the best character of the plot is certainly Henry Jones Sr., played by Sean Connery. We all know that Connery was in the heart of the action in the James Bond movies, but here, he perfectly fits as the old professor for whom danger and action mean nothing. As James Bond, Connery was able to play the character with seriousness and a devil-may-care attitude, but here, he looks like someone who never saw any gun showdown or auto chase. That's the good acting way.Of course, because it's Indiana Jones, the special effects and the action scenes must be interesting. Well, it's all true here. In fact, because of the mid-eastern environment and the main antagonists, added to the supernatural religious artifact, everything looks like if it was a \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" remake. But it all fits well and it owns its charms, without copying the \"Lost Ark\" principles.The movie is also funny. Sometimes, the dialog is laughable and the situations are greatly ironic.But the movie is also very serious and even has some historical truth: the book burnings. It was a true part of the Nazi regime and a quick look to that is highly appreciated.Overall, a great movie and a worthy addition to Steven Spielberg's filmography.

What made this one special is the father and son bond by Connery and Ford. They are both good in the movie and funny as well. The third film also has an amusing prologue with the young Indiana Jones character played by the late River Phoenix.

I, for one, cannot disagree with that assessment. The film is chock full of entertaining set-pieces, humour & the decision made to cast Sean Connery as Indiana Jones father Professor Henry Jones just worked wonderfully well. Alison Doody, in my opinion, was the best of the trilogies leading ladies. (Yes, i know there was a fourth but i am disregarding the later \"Crystal Skull\" which was a mistake). John Rhys-Davies was great & Denholm Elliott always seemed to enhance any movie he was ever in. Take \"Trading Places\", for instance. Most of the jokes used in the film are hilarious like when the \"Jones boys\" are forced to travel to Berlin during a book-burning nazi rally. After dressing up as a nazi officer & recovering his fathers diary, Indiana Jones inadvertently bumps into Adolf Hitler. Hitler naturally thinks he wants him to autograph his book & signs it. Not long after they board an airship to get them out of \"the lions den\". As the airship is awaiting take-off the SS officer Colonel Vogel comes on board looking for Indy & his dad. Indy sees him coming & dresses up as a ticket inspector. Colonel Vogel first finds his father Professor Jones trying to hide his face behind his newspaper. Indy challenges the SS officer to see his ticket, punches him, throws him out of a window & declares to the astonished passengers \"No ticket\". The passengers, not wishing anything similar happening to them, frantically all hold up their tickets. Two great gags amongst plenty more!.

            "content": "A good franchise has to tread a fine balance. On the one hand it must adapt as it goes along; audiences don't like to simply have the same movie rehashed every couple of years. But then again, you can't mess too much with a winning formula, and each successive picture must contain all the basic elements that made the original a hit. This third instalment of 1980s neo-swashbuckling Indiana Jones series builds on its household-name character, giving him a backstory and a family. It's a move which opens up several new possibilities without taking the franchise in too unfamiliar a direction.Last Crusade is the most dramatic and human of the trilogy, giving us a story arc (no Raiders-related pun intended) regarding Indy's reconciliation with his estranged father. Following on from the thing about giving the rock back to the village at the end of Temple of Doom, there is very much a sense of what's important and what's not, except here it's family and friendship that are the stakes. Not only is Jones, Sr. included as a major character, Marcus Brody and Sallah are reprised from the first movie, now playing more significant parts in the action. And Indy is betrayed by some of his new companions, making the older ties seem all the more significant. The screenplay was written by the bizarre combination of Jeffrey Boam and Tom Stoppard (although the two didn't work together, Stoppard doing a rewrite of Boam's earlier drafts). It's a testament to the skill of those two renowned writers that they can include all these ideas, make them work, and not detract at all from this being in body a rip-roaring action adventure. And of course its raison d'etre is still to be an action movie, but beginning and ending as it does with the relationship between the Joneses it gives the intervening adventure so much more meaning.Spielberg's style as a director has not changed exceptionally; he still likes to show key moments indirectly, focusing on close-ups of hands and props, but here it's used to add a layer of delicacy, showing us things in a tentative manner. For example, when Donovan tells Indy that his father has gone missing, Indy is holding his hat in the foreground. The hat dips slightly, giving us the merest hint of an emotional reaction from our stalwart hero. In the same scene there's an interesting juxtaposition, as Donovan tells Indy about the life-giving powers of the grail over a close-up of him pouring out champagne. In contrast, the action sequences are shot with simplicity and clarity, in nice straightforward mid-shots \u2013 quite unlike the confused mess of close-ups you get in today's action movies. As always the escapades have a lot of comedy to them, and Spielberg's no-frills approach to them is not unlike that of the great slapstick directors.The scope of Last Crusade introduces several crucial new figures to the Indiana Jones universe, and Spielberg has chosen his supporting actors wisely. The first who deserves a mention is River Phoenix, perhaps the most impressive youth actor since James Dean, and like Dean he sadly didn't live far into adulthood. Phoenix doesn't get to do much deep acting here, but what is neat is how he imitates Harrison Ford's stance and manners, giving us a very believable depiction of the young Indy. Then there's Sean Connery playing Indy's dad. Connery was cast in a nod towards his James Bond days, but the part is very different to the debonair persona of Bond and the many other heroes Connery played. Still, he proves himself to be very apt at playing the bumbling old professor. And yet there is an occasional forcefulness to his performance which, as with Phoenix, makes him appear a plausible member of the Jones household. Last Crusade also gives us a nice opportunity to see the delightful Denholm Elliot and John Rhys Davies in larger roles. Ford himself appears to have more fun with the part than ever before, the character now clearly fitting him like a glove. I love the scene in which puts on a bad Scots accent, presumably a tongue-in-cheek reference to Connery's unshakeable brogue. Then, again we also get to see Alexei Sayle playing Arabic with a hint of Liverpudlian.Last Crusade is not quite the best of the Indy movies. I find the business with the Grail and eternal life to be a bit less engaging than the Arc of the Covenant or the Sivalinga stones, as well as prone to plot holes. However, the theme of family loyalty and forgiveness is the real point of this story, which is perhaps why the Holy Grail angle is a little underdeveloped. In any case, the father-son dynamic more than makes up for any flaws in the plot, and makes this a fitting coda to a hugely enjoyable trilogy. I'm just glad Spielberg and co. decided to keep the Indy series as a purely 80s phenomenon, quitting while they were ahead and leaving us with just the three canonical classics. Oh, hang on, they did make another one didn't they? Oh dearie me",

However, we see the most important side of Indy in \"Last Crusade\": Henry Jones, Jr. We see the man, and Harrison Ford brings the character to such life.There is never a point in this particular installment of the Indiana Jones trilogy when the audience knows Indy is going to make it out in one piece. Here, we see tension, fear, and doubt. Indy isn't dealing with Indian rituals or solely with Nazis: he is dealing with the powers of God.In my opinion, this is by far and away the absolute best film in the Indiana Jones trilogy, and easily the most perfect adventure film ever made.",

            "review_title": "A Remarkable Sequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark",
            "content": "After the enormously successful Raiders of the Lost Ark & the highly disappointing Temple of Doom, Steven Spielberg & George Lucas bring back the very ingredients that made the former a defining classic of its genre plus infused it with lots of humour & heart to make the third film in the planned trilogy a fitting conclusion to the Indiana Jones saga.Set in 1938 & once again pitting our eminent archaeologist adventurer against the Nazis, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade covers the pursuit of the Holy Grail but mainly concerns the troubled relationship between Indiana Jones & his father; a Holy Grail scholar who has been kidnapped by Nazis. And so Indiana embarks on another adventure to find his father & also stop the Nazis from obtaining the mystical artifact.Opening with a highly impressive sequence that also served as the origin story of our beloved archaeologist, Steven Spielberg's direction expertly brings back the energy, excitement & quality that was lost in the previous film and keeps the plot relatively fresh & engaging from start to finish. The script is easily the wittiest of the three & keeps the lighthearted mood alive until the very end.Cinematography meticulously captures all the moments of action & drama and is constantly moving, set pieces & locations are wisely chosen, editing makes the runtime fly by and John Williams' score beautifully accompanies the adventure with its wonderful tracks. The visual effects also deserves a nod for its contribution to the film & the action sequences are spectacularly carried out.Coming to the performances, The Last Crusade brings back Harrison Ford & John Rhys-Davies in their respective roles of Indiana Jones & Sallah but also joining aboard this time is Sean Connery as Indiana's father; Henry Jones Sr., River Phoenix as young Jones in the prologue & others but the most exciting part for me remains the stunning father-son chemistry between Ford & Connery that makes this film work very well.On an overall scale, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is an amazing sequel to Raiders of the Lost Ark which expands the horizon & builds upon its premise without losing any of its attributes. Fiercely paced, wildly entertaining and featuring a gripping plot filled with right doses of action, humour, drama, mystery & adventure, it was the perfect finale for Indiana Jones saga & the final shot of the characters riding into the sunset couldn't have confirmed it better.",

But for adults (OK, teens too, unfortunately) it is colorful and extremely entertaining, just the thing for cold dreary winters here in the Pacific Northwest.I join other reviewers who note that the return to more familiar geographic and historical territory is welcome. The Temple of Doom catastrophe had to be done simply to capture the Asian market, with more familiar myths perhaps. A mistake in any case, as it had to be as insulting to the people of the East as it was to the people of the West.The Last Crusade is great fun. The female interest is by far the best of the three so far. She is gorgeous and intellectually a match for \"Indy\", not the hostile ex-child or the screaming harrion of the first two films. One could see why Jones regretted losing her down the hole. Oh well, where was the earthquake when we needed it in \"Temple\"?",

            "review_title": "The (Not Quite) Last Crusade",
            "content": "Tonight I wrapped up revisiting the Indy franchise with The Last Crusade. The five or so years between Temple of Doom and this installment gave Spielberg and Co. time to go back to basics, recast a few hundred Nazis, cart out another religious relic, reinforce some more Christian mythology and throw in a dose of Sean Connery for good measure. Benefiting TLC, the camp, corn and annoying female sidekick from TOD are long gone as is a supporting cast of way too many cute little kids that served an almost Ewok-like presence.The only kids in TLC are in the prologue which flashes back to the young Indy played by the late River Phoenix. The prologue's back story manages to cram in the origins of many (if not all) of Indy's trademarks: the hat, the whip, the fear of snakes and his overall look and demeanor. Phoenix convincingly apes Harrison Ford's signature Indy-isms and also manages to look like the kid Harrison probably was. True to the franchise, Spielberg rolls out a series of tributes, one of the best being the prologue's train sequence which feels like frames lifted right out from Buster Keaton's 1927 classic The General.What makes TLC a cut above TOD are the numerous real world locations, the pseudo- historical references and stunts grounded in real-world physics. Connery who is cast as Indy's dad, is a worthy addition to a strong cast and the constant adversarial banter between him and Ford doesn't get tired like the nagging supplied ad nausea by Kate Capshaw in TOD.While it can be argued TLC cannibalizes Raiders for success, I can't find a reason to argue with the old adage: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Like Raiders, TLC is truly an adventure, an homage to classic Hollywood serials that manages to elevate the genre well beyond that of any of its predecessors. I've maintained for years that Spielberg is a master story teller, but that his talents run threadbare when he steps out of his comfort zone. TLC is definitely in his comfort zone and after watching it tonight, I'm even more hopeful that The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull will be a worthy addition to an already fantastic saga.http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/",

            "review_title": "Maybe my all-time favorite action film.",
            "content": "***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** **** out of ****Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade features the most action, adventure, comedy, and character development in the series.  Does this make it the best in the series?  In my book, I suppose so (it's been a while since I've seen Raiders).  In any case, The Last Crusade is a superb, fast-paced, non-stop thrill ride that's more fun than any rollercoaster ride I've ridden.  This film definitely has its heart set in the old days of Saturday Matinee Serials, and if you just don't get any enjoyment out of this movie, I feel sorry for you.For the third-go-round, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford, who else?) has been hired by myterious benefactor, Donovan, to continue the search for the lost cup of Christ, the Holy Grail.  Indy is reluctant at first, but when he discovers his father, Henry Jones (Sean Connery), led the first expedition and disappeared, he agrees.  Teaming up with Dr. Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliot) and the beautiful Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), they proceed to figure out the riddle of the numbers in the library, which leads to the completion of seal on the knight's tomb (if this sounds complex, don't worry, it really isn't).Now on the search for both the Grail and his father, Indy discovers traitors among his midst and can only rely on his old friends, including Sallah (John Rhys-Davies).  Captured by the Nazis, who are also searching for the Grail, he finds his father.  Together, they escape and it becomes a race against time to reach the secret location of the Grail before the Nazis get their hands on it.It was probably pointless for me to describe the plot since almost everyone has seen this movie.  Yes, I realize a lot of people will probably call me crazy for considering this the best in the trilogy, but for me, it simply felt more adventurous and fun the original (don't get me wrong, Raiders is a VERY close second to this).  It's lighter-hearted than the other films in the series and it's one gross-out scene (all three have got one) is considerably less bloody than the others.I've always considered Steven Spielberg cinema's best action director (if not the overall best director), and he proved himself in true superb fashion in The Last Crusade, directing some marvelous setpieces.  The train sequence is a great touch and is among my favorite chase scenes.  The motorcycle is chase is also a lot of fun, and the climactic tank chase (boy, we've got a lot of chases going on) is a true standout.Humor is what separates it apart from Raiders and Temple of Doom.  Now, both those movies had their fair share of great comedy, but The Last Crusade is absolutely hilarious, and all the better for it.  Harrison Ford and Sean Connery have absolutely brilliant chemistry together, with most of the laughs coming from their retorts to one another.  Credit should also be given to the late Jeffrey Boam's script, which is witty and smart.  He simply knew what the audience wanted, and delivered.Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones, of course, and he was born to play the man. Nobody else would have fit the role and, once again, the movie is mostly his (he's gotta bump aside just a bit for Connery and company).  Just as terrific is Connery as the not-so-affectionate father who has no idea how to tell his feelings to his son.  Their interaction plays off very well, and Spielberg wisely never gives in to any maudlin sentimentality.  Trust me, that one scene where Henry Jones thinks his son is dead is played more for laughs than anything else.The supporting cast is a lot of fun, too.  Denholm Elliot, who didn't seem quite this goofy in Raiders, is very funny and likable as the somewhat clumsy Marcus Brody.  John Rhys-Davies is equally good and fun to watch as the jovial Sallah.  These four are the good guys, and unlike most films, they steal every scene they're in, never giving in to whatever performances the \"villains\" deliver.These villains are played by Julian Glover and Alison Doody.  Glover is appropriately snaky and easy to hiss at as the traitorous Donovan.  Doody is the third Jones girl, and she's easily the best-looking and least annoying, which makes it a small pity she plays a not-so-nice girl.There's been plenty of speculation on a fourth Indiana Jones film, but I don't see it happening.  Ford has aged too much, same with Connery, and I don't believe I would really be that interested to see Costner as Indy's brother, fun as it may sound.  But it may be better that the series ends this way, on such a high note.  The Last Crusade pretty much has all action/adventure fans are looking for and more:  Great action, great characters, great locations, and a lot of fun.  That's why this is one of my favorites.",

Upon hearing from a private collector, Walter Donavan, that the mission for the Holy Grail went astray with the disappearance of his father, Indiana Jones and museum curator, Marcus Brody, venture to Italy in search of Indy's father.However, upon retrieving Dr. Henry Jones in Nazi territory, the rescue mission turns into a race to find the Holy Grail before the Nazis do, who plan to use it for complete world domination for their super-race. With the diary as a vital key and the map with no names as a guide, Indiana Jones once again finds himself in another death defying adventure of pure excitement.Well, I was surly disappointed in this film. It's still a good film, but not as entertaining nor fun as the previous two. What I missed in this movie was the whole archaeological sense, booby traps, and technical aspect from the last two. In here, it felt like watching \"National Treasure\" and \"The Da Vinci Code\" all over again, but in a less entertaining way.I might be bashed by saying that but I really expected more than just another \"look for treasure\" type of movie that doesn't do it as entertaining as the previous two mentioned film.

            "content": "For his third Indiana Jones adventure, Steven Spielberg once again pits his heroic, Fedora wearing, whip-cracking archaeologist against pre-war Nazis, who are up to their old tricks again, searching for religious artifacts that will grant them supernatural powers. This time around, Indy (Harrison Ford) must try and beat the goose-stepping Germans to the 'Holy Grail', the cup that held the blood of Christ, which is said to grant eternal life to those who drink from it.Whilst it's admittedly nice to see Ford back in action against his old foes, the Nazis (who, let's face it, always make excellent villains), and director Spielberg does manage to deliver one or two well orchestrated, stunt filled action sequences, The Last Crusade fails to match either of its predecessors in terms of sheer entertainment value.Raiders was a near perfect blend of action and adventure from start to finish, with great characters, flawless direction, and excellent visuals; the less immaculate Temple of Doom still managed to be a hugely enjoyable effort overall, thanks to its sheer exuberance; but Crusade is a far less fulfilling experience.Much of the blame can be laid at the feet of whoever came up with the idea to introduce us to Indiana's father, a superfluous character (played by a terribly miscast Sean Connery) created to give our hero emotional depth where none was required, whilst also delivering a few cheap laughs; but the film also suffers from poorly considered moments (Indy takes a flaming torch with him down a tunnel swimming in petrol; Indy frees the guardian of the grail who, moments earlier, had tried to kill him; Indy and his pals can only see a giant 'X' on the library floor by climbing up a staircase and looking down), some risible effects (the Nazi zeppelin looks terrible), and a rather disappointing climax involving three 'tests' for Indy that equate to a well timed duck and jump, a spelling bee, and a quick jaunt across a stone bridge.6.5 out of 10, which I'll generously round up to 7, because it's still marginally better than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.",

            "content": "'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' is better than the original for many reasons. It's a film that doesn't just hit you but involves you more in the story line. Part of why it is easier to go along for that ride is because you've been prepared by the previous film to expect certain things despite this there are also some new and creative elements in this movie which separates it. \tIn the beginning we get what is seemingly an unattached scene. In this one we flash back to when Indiana was a child, played by River Phoenix. His chase for a crucifix establishes a few things. First, it establishes that this will be yet another religious relic that they will be in search of. Second, and more importantly it defines who his arch enemy is. We also get glimpses into the character's psyche whereas previously he was a very external being we get this just through seeing past events. Young Indiana picks up a whip for the first time when coming face to face with a lion. Then we see the interplay between him and his father and can see how the boy doesn't understand how his father could've dedicated his whole life to these adventures especially in his mother's absence. \tWhen Indiana is pegged for a mission the discussion of it is much more confrontational than in the first. There is a lot more give and take. Indy shows part of his disbelief in the grail while we are told the history in much more detail than we were in the first film when Indy was in search of the Ark of the Covenant. He's very reluctant to go but is urged on by the fact that his father has been kidnapped this after him mysteriously receiving his father's Grail Diary. \tThis film is full of riddles and mind games which makes it that much more entertaining. He arrives in the library that was a converted church and with Ilsa Schneider () they have to solve a puzzle of where the catacombs are. They look for the Roman numerals but can't find one. Indy on a hunch runs up the stairs and sees the X all across the floor. Down in the dark with all the rats Spielberg reaches a moment of terror with all the rats crawling along. \tAnother great touch this film had was in keeping with the traditions of the 40s and 50s in that we could never quite figure anyone out. I was genuinely surprised by Ilsa both when we were shown she was a Nazi and then later when she mislead her leader in the choosing which grail was the Holy Grail. That coupled with her femme fatale status of seducing men only to ruin them made her seem like something out of a film noir. \tThe tandem of Sean Connery and Harrison Ford worked very well together. Their timing is great especially when they were both tied up and were trying to talk to one another face to face and their heads kept swiveling side to side. Their relationship dominated significant portions of the film and they exchanged great moves and funny lines constantly. On the zeppelin the ball was in Junior's court and stayed their as they escaped but in the plane Senior had to shoot the machine gun and shot the tail off and was hysterical in denying it. Then on the beach he got the seagulls flapping to knock down the second plane. \tWhat I also found quite interesting in both this film and the first although it was more prominent in this film was the involvement and use of the Nazis. It was interesting for me because I had believed Spielberg had never addressed any aspect of the war in any sort of way until making 'Schindler's List.' Having established the Nazi interest in the occult and in conquering religion I think that's why there was more Nazi involvement here. It also allowed for a hilarious scene where Ford dressed as a Nazi who comes face to face with Adolf Hitler who instead of burning the grail diaries signs it for him and moves on from there. \tFor me the only stumbling blocks to make this a completely fulfilling experience cam towards the end. When Indiana must spell out the name of God, Jehovah was not the name that immediately came to mind it was, in fact, Yahweh which was the original Hebrew word which people did not speak and when it was written there were no vowels. However, it was later replaced by Jehovah. This is no fault on the filmmakers part its just a slight technicality that some may or may not pick up on. \tThis time, however, I was prepared for what would happen to the man who drank from the false grail because it was foreshadowed and also because it closely resembled the end of the first film. My one question lay in the fact that it seemed to me from the way the situation was explained that Indiana would now be immortalized and would have to guard the grail or his father would maybe perhaps they escape that by trying to remove the grail it did get a little hazy in that regard but nonetheless it was quite an enjoyable film that blended many diverse elements to make for a really entertaining ride.",

The plot is well thought out for this one, going back to the first movie in the series & using a biblical theme. For some reason, this element missing seemed to detract from the second installment of the series. The cup of Christ seems a perfect follow for the Ark of the Covenant. There is plenty of light comedy in the film. Every thing from father & son sharing the same lover (wonder if Celista Flockhart would like to try that in real life?) to Adolf Hitler autographing Dr. Henry Jones book in a bizarre sequence of events that starts on a blimp, no less.The father / son plot line works well in creating comedy & emotional ties in their sharing the adventure as well.

But here's why its so great In this, the prologue takes place with young Indy's adventure in 1912, which is fun and interesting to see Indy as a boy scout escaping from gangsters. The rest of the movie takes place 2 years after Raiders in 1938, where Indy must hunt for the holy grail before the Nazis and find his missing father. OK, I admit that it is like Raiders, but I am totally fine with it because Raiders is an amazing film, and this is a well executed film that is linked with it. Unlike Temple of doom, its a sequel that actually follows raiders and has Marcus Brody, Sallah, and Nazis, making this related to Raiders. But the only problem is that there were some plot holes in the 3rd act (I won't spoil it). But other than that, its much more pleasant and great than seeing monkey brains being eaten and children being enslaved, and having an annoying love interest like in Temple of doom.The special effects are great as always. But the only problem is that in one flying scene, it looked fake. So great special effects that look great are a great addition to a great movie (That may've sounded ridiculous).The characters in this are great as well. Indiana Jones is charming as always and fun to follow on his adventure. Marcus Brody is very helpful and smart, but I've always noticed that every movie that character is in, it turns out amazing. Then there's my favorite character in the movie, Henry Jones Sr played by erstwhile James Bond, Sean Connery. Not only is he charming, but he's smart, funny, (especially \"Junior\")and extremely helpful. The Nazis (not the same ones in Raiders of the lost ark)are greedy like in Raiders, but they are great as villains because they are fierce for power and memorable. There's Sallah (who was in Raiders as well) who is kind and helpful, making him a great character once again. The only character that's kind of in the middle is Elsa Schnider, the \"love interest\" that turns out to be a Nazi villain like Donovan. Sometimes I just feel like she switches sides a lot like I was confused that at the Nazis burning the books, she looked upset watching then the next time we see her, she's loyal to the Nazis. Se is a kind of OK villain, but it just leaves me a little confused. So overall, there truly is a great set of characters.The last crusade is my favorite of the franchise. It is the most exciting, with great characters. I am surprised that some people think Temple of doom is better. I think not. I notice that Raiders of the lost ark is to The last crusade as Home alone is to Home alone 2. Well, Last crusade isn't exactly like Raiders of the lost ark, but they are similar in their own franchise. So if you liked Raiders of the lost ark,, watch this!!",

The two preceding instalments are arguably better, but this is the most entertaining of the Indiana Jones films because of the chemistry of the two leads, Harrison Ford and Sean Connery.Returning to the 1930's Germany theme it provides a well written storyline. The previous movie, set in India divided fans most likely because it was a such a jolt from the first movie.Returning to familiar circumstances this film introduces Indy's father. Sean Connery gives one the best performances of his career and certainly the best of his late period.If it wasn't for the casting of Sean Connery. This would not be often regarded as the best of the Indiana Jones movies.",

            "review_title": "The greatest third installment of a series ever",
            "content": "Thanks to the Godfather and Rocky movies, sequels became a part of our vernacular in the 70's.  If there was a sequel before these two franchises, I can't remember them.  And since sequels have meant pretty much big bucks at the box office, many times they are pale imitations to the original.   To name a few movie franchises that have now gone on to do at least three films, you have the Rocky's, Godfather, Halloween, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Aliens, Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Jaws, Star Wars, Batman, Rambo, Superman, Scream, Child's Play, Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  These are just a few of the film franchises that have gone on to do at least three films.  And I can guarantee you that no film series can boast that their third offering is almost as good as their first.  It just doesn't happen.  It is hard to duplicate the energy and originality of the first one that came out.  But the Indy movies are different.  First of all they are created by two of the best in the business and they star one of the greatest actors to ever live.  And what you get when you have two creative genius behind the scenes is a series that tries so hard to please and a series that doesn't rehash the story that made the first one work.  You get a story that furthers the trials and tribulations of the hero Indiana Jones, and you get a film that keeps giving you insights into his life.  In the first, we meet Indiana Jones, the daring archeologist that risks life and limb to recover artifacts for his museum.  You also meet Marion Ravenwood, a long lost love, Marcus Brody, his mentor and boss and Sola, one of best friends from Cairo and Belloq ( or according to Sola, Bellosh ).  Temple of Doom takes us back in time and introduces us to Short Round. And finally we have Last Crusade.  Here we meet Indiana Jones as a teenager.  We are introduced to the folklore that is Indiana Jones.  We see how his fear of snakes started, how he was introduced to his bullwhip and his fedora and even how he got that famous scar on his chin.  And in the casting coup of the century, we meet his dad played by Sean Connery.  We are also treated to some familiar faces as Brody and Sola return.  Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the best second sequel ever made.  This could have been the beginning to a series if we didn't already know about Raiders of the Lost Ark.  It is that much fun and so filled with richness.The only complaint that I have about this film is what they did with Marcus Brody.  In Raiders, he tells Indy that if he were five years younger he would have gone after the Ark himself.  He was a warrior and one who probably went on many adventures in the style that Indy did.  But in this one they forgot all about that adventurous side to him and instead they went for comic relief at his expense.  Any true Indy fan will tell you that he should have been able to handle himself when he bumped into Sola.  He should have been everything that Indy told Ilsa and Donovan that he was when they found out that Brody had the map.  But aside from this small discrepency, the film is flawless and one of the most entertaining films ever made.  And even though the talent involved here dictates that it should be perfect, keep in mind that making a sequel is never easy.  You now have devoted fans that are going to judge you with every written word, every swing of the whip and every new character introduced.  Last Crusade succeeds where most others fail and that is perhaps because the makers and star of this film ( Steven, George, Frank and Harrison ) care about Indiana Jones.  They want him to be the same as he was in Raiders and Temple.  I saw this film 12 times at the theatre when it came out.  I was fortunate enough to know an usher at The London Mews back in 1989 and he let me stay for the second and third showing of the day ( and night ) free of charge. This was a time when movies were events, they were and still are larger than life to me.  I get excited when I see a good one and I get anxious when a movie like this comes out.  I sincerely hope they get around to making a fourth one because as excited as I was to see Star Wars Episode 1, that excitement will pale in comparison to when I am sitting in the theater one day and I am waiting to see the new Tom Hanks movie ( whatever that may be at the time ) and that John Williams music invades the speakers and tells me that there is a new Indy movie that is going to be released on Victoria Day Weekend ( here in Canada that is).  I will count the days down until it comes out.  The Indy movies are what movies are all about.  They are a micorcosm of entertainment and as close to a religious experience, filmwise, as you can come.  Raiders was a great beginning, Temple furthered the story wonderfully and Crusade summed it up beautifully.  My life is richer because Indiana Jones is a part of it, and I know I am not the only one that feels that way. Gary, if you ever read this review, buddy, this one is for you.  Long live Indiana Jones!!",

            "content": "I remember going to see Indy's third film back in 1989 at the theatre with my father. Funny enough a good buddy and next door neighbour Scott was there with his own father right behind us. We both loved this movie in what we thought at the time was the final installment in the amazing Indiana Jones series.Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford playing one of his greatest roles) this time is hired by Walter Donovan (Julian Glover) to find the Cup of Christ or the Holy Grail only to find out his father (Sean Connery) is missing and was originally hired for this mission.Both Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies return as Brody and Sallah after being absent in the previous film. They do both some nice flavour and known allies to fight with Indy. To me Connery is perfectly cast as Indy's father. Ford and Connery together are great and really make this film move so well.Once again directed by Steven Spielberg who does a great job in creating a wonderful further adventure for Indiana Jones. Written by Jeffrey Boam and based on a story by George Lucas and Menno Meyjes. John Williams once again brings a terrific score.Now I must say of all the films that George Lucas made that came with incredible wait, wonder and perhaps receiving feedback from previous entries this is to me the only one that he did hit a homerun on. I found STAR WARS parts I through III to yes get better as they went along, but extremely disappointing. INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL was while good and hit the mark for being worth a watch it was totally disappointing when put up against the previous three films. This entry is I would say the funniest or the silliest of the Indy films, but both Spielberg and Lucas wanted to make that kind of film after feedback from the ultra-dark INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (which I loved, but also understand you can not and should not stay in dark territory for a franchise like Indy).The late-great River Phoenix also plays the young Indiana Jones at the beginning of the film. I thought he was great in the role as he really is acting like Harrison Ford would. He is after a crucifix that was owned by Coronado. It is quite funny to me because the villain played by Paul Maxwell eerily looks like Guy Caballero from SCTV.So, if you are reading this and have never seen this film please start at RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and go through them in order. If you have and in the very least enjoyed RAIDERS you should certainly enjoy this adventure.",

It's not bad by any means; it's still a better historical adventure than The DaVinci Code or any other recent entry in the genre. But it's lacking a bit of the bit of the old Indy magic that made the first two movies so fun.For the first half of the movie, it almost seems more like a James Bond movie than Raiders of the Lost Ark. There's very little raiding to be had. And for the second half, it's almost TOO MUCH like Raiders. The reason I liked Temple of Doom so much is that it added a lot of new elements while keeping true to the spirit of the first movie. That's what I was expecting from Crusade as well, but the focus on Indy's dad just didn't do much for me.What I did like was how funny the movie was. Every entry in the series has had some level of humor, but Last Crusade was absolutely hysterical at times. No painfully obvious, forced gags that would ruin the tone, just lots of quick little jokes that you'll miss if you're not paying attention.\u00a0I hate being so harsh on a movie that's not bad by any measure. But I was so pleased with how much more I like the second movie than the first, that it's really disappointing to find the third to be the least entertaining of the bunch.",

Many scenes, whether they are of the exploratory or action-induced type, smell of mimicry, particularly the film's later sequences attempting to emulate Raider's desert action.Thankfully Connery's elegant presence works wonders for the film's dynamic, who helps pull so many of the predictable but always impressive action sequences out of an impending mediocrity.",

Yet Last Crusade is still an immensely enjoyable adventure picture, with Spielberg proving that he was still capable of a popcorn bonanza. Using the Raiders formula and moving away from the dark flourishes of Temple Of Doom, Last Crusade is actually the simplest film of the three, but still it manages, courtesy of a sparkling casting decision, to become the most entertaining of the original trilogy. Is it better than Raiders? Of course not, but it positively rips along with sparky dialogue and an agenda of cliffhanging suspense like the adventure films of yore. In comes Sean Connery as Dr Jones Senior, and its the picture's trump card, because the magnificent interplay and obvious rapport with Ford (cool as a cucumber) is there for all to see. It's this what drives the film on thru it's more mundane and picture filler sequences, showcasing two top wily professionals with care and consideration to their craft. The casting of Alison Doody as the main female is a poor one, and one only has to look at her subsequent career post Crusade to see she wasn't up to the task here. Bonus comes in the form of the River Phoenix prologue, Phoenix as the young Indiana paves the way for the jaunty path that Crusade takes, whilst simultaneously giving us a nice little back story from which to launch the adventure.",

Connery is a fine actor and I guess the idea was to have a dynamic duo of attractive actors. Unfortunately, dad and son spend most of their time bickering and sounding silly.The final indignity is the disappearance of the only strong female character - the spunky Marion - replaced by a blonde bimbo who cannot act and seems to be in the cast only to provide minimal sexual friction.The search is the usual jumping from place to place, around the world, while punching and getting punched by the Nazis in overlong scenes - inclusive of the compulsory chase and the overbearing musical score.",

What makes it work I think is the father/son camaraderie of Harrison Ford and Sean Connery who play off each other effectively, and in many cases without saying a word. Like the 'she talks in her sleep' scene that floors Indy, that was just a hoot. And the old 'pen is mightier than the sword' gimmick takes on new meaning when the senior Jones finds himself in a tough spot.

Steven Spielberg directed with a good eye for style and lighting as well as action sequences. Douglas Slocombe deserves credit for lucid cinematography, as do Fred Hole and Stphen Scott for their art direction, Peter Howitt for his set decorations and all the designers involved for bringing a lost era to vivid life. Among the actors, Julian Glover as the villain, John Rhys Davies and Denholm Elliott as the hero's friends, and Sean Connery stood out from a good cast of minor villains and lesser characters. As the troubled heroine, Alison Doody was adequate and occasionally more. Harrison Ford's intelligent lead as Indiana Jones carried the film much of the time; he has a lot to do inn the busy film and did it very well both physically and vocally, in my opinion. In a less coherent presentation, the dangers, pursuers and contrived special-effects sequences could easily have become tedious; here they never were, I assert.

The adventure is far from over though; before they get to the site Indy will have to rescue his father from his Nazi captors, escape in a zeppelin. Later he must fight Nazis on top of a tank and eventually navigate a series of traps, which have killed numerous people already before reaching that room that contains the Grail\u0085 even now there is a final test.After the darker feel of 'Temple of Doom' this returns to the lighter tone of the original 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'\u0085 this is both a strength and a weakness. On the plus side there are lots of thrilling moments that are exciting rather than scary and the Nazis always make great villains; on the down side it feels too similar to 'Raiders' with the search for another biblical artefact while going up against Nazis. Things open well; I liked how this one section managed to explain so much about Indy; most notably his whip and iconic hat. The main story contains lots of great set pieces as well as some good unforced comedy moments. The cast does a fine job; Harrison Ford is on great form as protagonist Indiana Jones and Sean Connery is a welcome addition as Indy's father. Other fine performances came from Denholm Elliott as a somewhat bumbling friend of the Joneses who gets caught up in their adventure; Julian Glover who is an effective villain. Overall I heartily recommend this for anybody looking for a fine family friendly adventure that should thrill, rather than scare, viewers of all ages except perhaps younger children.",

Now, in fairness, \"Temple\" is probably better than generally given credit, but the overall order is correct.The Nazi villains here are among the nastiest, the plot is weaving in the way that we want from an Indy film... and the object of their search?

            "content": "After the unforgettable movie experiences of the Color Purple and Empire of the Sun The Master of Film was back for the 3rd Indiana Jones Adventure and this Time Indiana Jones is bringing his dad along for the ride too in this entertaining wild adventure full of chase sequences great comedic foreplay and a wonderful central theme What is more important Life or Treasure? I love all the Indiana Jones adventures but this one is my favourite because of the beautiful David Lean style direction at the beginning with Young Indiana Jones and the race on the speeding train as the music escalates and rides along with the train the speed of the music the exhilaration as the chase picks up speed and pace as the music keeps going and going like the train the Music is the train at the beginning 15 minutes just relentless speed and exhilaration it is so forceful and fast very fast speeding along as the film begins! John Williams's wonderful fast paced score is My favourite of the whole of the Indiana Jones Series I love them all but there are many reasons the score is the best, the themes are all different and unique and like all John's scores they all represent a theme a idea a melodic identification for each character place props story or ideas and themes like redemption or glory or the film's message or the comedy banter between Indy's dad And Indy himself! The film successfully intertwines themes or overwhelming ideas of spiritualism or glory and redemption with a sense of fun and adventure and the human spirit being lifted soaring across the sky like in Empire of the Sun but this is not a drama but still it retains those themes from Empire of the Sun but presents them differently with the fun and adventure of Indiana Jones and his dad flying across the sky or on their motorbike as they flee the Nazis and the music intertwines themes for the Nazis and Indy and his dad ridding off on their motorbike to a scherzo for motorbike and orchestra wonderfully named and composed by John Williams! Sean Connery is the big star name here as Indy's father but Harrison Ford still has a whale of a time playing back and forth with Sean Connery it is a joy when they are on screen together they have 2 musical melodic themes one is fun and adventurous and exciting the other is more poignant and is more associated with the father because the relationship in the film is not as relaxed as it was before in a way the theme for the father is a memory or a motif for Indy's past or childhood it is very very patriotic but not sentimental or syrupy in any way shape of form it is a melodic theme an idea a memory a visit to the past! The film's message what is more important Life or Treasure is more of a spiritual message a spiritual ritual if you will a rite of passage and is very dominant at the end of the film the last 25 minutes is so important because the relationship heals becomes stronger after a wounded fractured past the relationship is severely broken down they are very condescending of each other making wisecracks puns you get the idea but by the end the film makes a poignant statement on the importance on family over treasure as Indy asks his father What did you find dad? Me? Illumination! the Holy Grail has recaptured their relationship and their bond is stronger more developed more tighter and their friendship is more kindly and forgiving to one another as they ride off into the sunset for the last time or so it seems? Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the greatest adventure film of all time alongside Raiders of the Lost Ark and the overwhelming power of the ending makes it stand out with the adventure and the comedy and the fantastic 15 minute opening train scene!",

It has a much better plot, strong performances and very strong story that keeps you hooked. Its not always fun but it still keeps you engrossed. The thing that I liked the most was the final scene that existed for twenty minutes. It was so enthralling and a bit, not actually scary but creepy as my heart pounded whenever Indiana took a step forward. I'm not going to describe the story as it has already been mentioned. The plot is a very high point of the story. It seemed as if the writers had the scenes in their minds from before and knew what they wanted to show in the right sequence. Therefore, rather than just having tons of action, we have some discussions and serious conversations. But that doesn't rob the excitement of the movie as it yet has all the elements of fun that is so action-packed.The acting is very good by almost everyone. I'm glad that there is no pain in the butt stars that keep pestering during the film. Most of the characters are of importance and none of them get wasted in their respective roles. The first opening shot is mind blowing and shows why Indiana loathes snakes. It also provides the same excitement and the young Indiana too does a fine job.Sean Connery is very good as the father, who has his moments. The actress of the movie too has done a commendable job. But I felt that they should break the monotony of Indiana being betrayed by most of his people. The Holy Grail is as such a fascinating topic and I felt that it was explored well.At last, I feel that this is my personal favorite. I'm not a fan of the Indiana franchises as I felt that only this and the first part were really good and therefore being a non-fan, I was glad to like this movie enjoy the hell of an action. 8 out of 10.",

This could have been titled Abbott and Costello and the Holy Grail, with it's pathetic attempts at humour. Connery is about as convincing as Ford's father as Jessie Royce Landis was as Cary Grant's mother in North by Northwest. And strange though it may seem, in 1938 it was illegal to kill German soldiers in cold blood, which Indiana Jones does with reckless abandon, and without any official sanction (at least James Bond had a licence to kill).

            "content": "After two masterpieces (one very underrated), the dual Spielberg and George Lucas had achieved complete success, and didn't plan to stop there. Spielberg promised Lucas since the beginning that if would make one he would have to make a trilogy. And they didn't disappointed closing their trilogy with a golden key with another underrated masterpiece that captured millions of fans and made Dr. Indiana Jones legendary forever.Our great adventure this time begins when our unforgettable Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) in another of his adventures in the middle of the Pacific ocean being beat-up by pirates. When Dr. Jones takes control of the situation and steal a strange diary from the leader, manages to escape with a job well done (the first in the trilogy). Days later, we see our hero back to his college teaching job educating young mind. After the class, Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) chief and friend of Jones comes and warns him that Walter Donovan (Julian Glover), a relics collector want to offer him a new job. Shortly after the conversation with Walter, Jones discovers that the work involves the diary that he recovered from the pirates, showing the path to find the \"Holy Grail\" (for those who do not know, the cup that Christ drank at the Last Supper). And Jones also finds out that this job had already been offered to his father Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery), who disappeared in a museum in Venice. Now Jones embarks on a mission to find his father with Marcus and the path to the Holy Grail, which will take them from a museum in Venice to the Arabic deserts with danger following them closely.I think Lucas and Spielberg in this film have decided to put all that was good in the first and second film and joined perfectly (which the last movie of a trilogy usually does). Proof of this is the return of Marcus making him a very important character in the adventure, and later the return of Sallah (John Rhys - Davies) who doesn't have much relevance, but it is fun to see him again since the first film. But the main thing that Lucas and Spielberg gave the story was to humanize the character of Indiana Jones.They do this through the first sequence of the film where we see a younger Indiana Jones, where we discovered many secrets of his past and finally the origin of the cowboy hat and the whip, even his name (and finally the reference to the Western genre in a film Spielberg). And when his father Henry Jones appears, and perhaps the best thing of the film. Since the first meeting in the movie of the Joneses, we already see the type of relationship between them two. Henry is a born lover of artifacts and history, giving more attention to study than the son who has created some resentment to his father. But their relationship throughout the film not only evolves, but thanks to the actors, they have an exceptional chemistry, making us laugh and love them even more.All this also thanks to the screenwriter Jeffrey Boam. Since the first film Lucas and Spielberg always changed the writers. Lawrence Kasdan in the first (considered one of the best screenplays ever written) and the couple Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz in the second (underrated). But Jeffrey didn't disappoint, making almost equal to Lawrence in the first, giving moments of dialog in the film, none of them gets to be boring, always flowing along very well in the story, especially between the Jones duo. Also filling the movie with a laughing out loud humor (perhaps the most humorous of the trilogy) but never gets to be stupid, but works very well in all the situations and the relationship of father and son.Mention direction and performances this time is stupid. Since the 1st movie Spielberg never disappoint in their direction, and wouldn't be different this time giving spectacular (and hilarious) action scenes from start to finish. And Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones never disappointed, and would not be this time (perhaps his best performance as the unforgettable and badass teacher). This also involves Sean Cornery giving an unforgettable character with a superb performance, and he and Harrison giving an incredible chemistry in their characters.Maybe not the best of the trilogy, but it's a fans favorite, and not for nothing. From a superb script that gives humor and soul to their characters, a marvelous direction, excellent performances, the best chemistry ever put between two characters in a movie. Spielberg and Lucas finished their trilogy giving heart and soul to Indiana Jones, reminding us why we love him, and making this saga forever legendary! 10/10",

            "content": "\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" has everything you could possibly want in an entertainment film, and does every bit of it to perfections. Action, humor, romance, heart - every element is flawless. It is impossible to imagine a more enjoyable cinematic experience.Harrison Ford's performance has an effortless level of wit and charm, and the relationship between Indy and his father adds a new and welcome dimension to the character. Sean Connery plays one of the most unique roles of his career - a stuffy, bookish and vaugely wimpy professor who is quite the opposite of the suave James Bond or the hard as nails Marko Ramius. Yet his distinct sense of dignity is preserved, and he and Ford have Redford and Newman quality chemistry. The supporting cast contributes a great deal, particularly returning \"Raiders\" sidekicks Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies. Underrated character actor Michael Byrne also does a nice turn as a Nazi commander, while Alison Doody makes for quite possibly Indy's most appealing and intriguing love interest. While Julian Glover's Walter Donovan doesn't have the prescence of previous Jones villains, he is nonetheless a interesting character, and Glover gives a capable performance.The script (by Jefferey Boam, with uncredited but unmistakable work by acclaimed playwriter and Oscar winning screenwriter Tom Stoppard) is extremely witty, but never in a self conscious or smirky William Goldman sort of way, and delves deeper into the character of Indiana Jones than the previous two films.John Williams score ranks among the best and most fully realized ever for a sequel. Rather than merely recycling the same themes, Williams created sensitive, evocative and downright fun music, complementing with occasional snatched of his own classic \"Raiders March.\"Finally, Steven Spielberg's direction is at it's most imaginative and assured. The action sequences are eye-popping, and the character interaction is equally entertaining.There is no legitimate criticism to be made of \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\" It is the highest standard to which escapist entertainment can aspire.",

Alison Doody plays an Austrian colleague of the latter.After the cartoony farce of \"Temple of Doom\" (1984), Spielberg went back to the blueprint of \"Raiders of the Last Ark\" (1981) to make this third film in the franchise. The problem is that, while good in many ways, \"Last Crusade\" is second-rate by comparison. \"Raiders\" copped the perfect tone for this kind of adventure flick: Quasi-realistic with a fun, kinetic edge. As wild as the actions scenes in \"Raiders\" were, most of them were later reenacted on a TV show in order to see if they were plausible, and they were! Unfortunately, \"Last Crusade\" mixed the plot of \"Raiders\" with the silliness of \"Temple\" and so many of the action sequences smack more of a cartoon than reality. The escape from the zeppelin in the parasite biplane is a good example. Then there's the silly bickering and bumbling of father and son, like when they're tied-up in the castle or facing the Nazis in (what is now) Turkey.Thankfully, there are eventually some good scenes between the two, which shed insight on them and their troubled relationship. And the globetrotting is great, starting with Arches National Park, then Venice, an Austrian-German castle, Berlin and Turkey. While cartoony and second-rate (compared to \"Raiders\"), the action sequences are often fun and thrilling. And the striking Doody is fine on the female front. Some critics wrote her character off as a \"blonde bimbo,\" but this is inexplicable seeing as how she's palpably intelligent and sophisticated. Regrettably, the climax is overlong and curiously dull despite its attempt at spiritual profoundness.THE MOVIE RUNS 127 minutes and was shot in Arches National Park, Utah; Hertfordshire, England; Venice, Italy; Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany; London & other places in England; numerous locations in Spain; Colorado; Amarillo, Texas; New Mexico; and Petra, Jordan.

            "content": "The Last Crusade is the Indiana Jones film I've seen least. In fact, I may be lying if I were to say I've seen it more than once all the way through before this viewing. Having watched all three of the original trilogy last week, I have to say, there isn't a great gap between them in quality. They're all three excellent movies with brilliant direction by Spielberg, and pitch-perfect action sequences, paced just so as not to overwhelm the viewer. The Last Crusade is the most comic of the three films, adding Sean Connery as Indy's father and pairing the two as a kind of Abbot and Costello team. It's shocking just how well it works \u0096 if I hadn't seen the movie and you told me Harrison Ford and Sean Connery would be the perfect comic duo, I'd have been more than a little dubious. Connery isn't known for his comic chops, but, if he didn't have them before, he definitely earned them here. I think, after James Bond (and I'd say unfortunately so), his Henry Jones Sr. will prove to be his most remembered performance. Denholm Elliot and John Rhys-Davies both return from Raiders, and both are more comic characters this time around (Elliot in particular is hilarious; I think Sallah is kind of wasted in this one). Alison Doody plays Indy's double-crossing love interest. I had remembered her as being particularly forgettable, but this time around I thought she was quite good. I still have to wonder what happened to Karen Allen (which is kind of explained in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull), who was by far the best of the Indy girls, but Doody is good at what she does. River Phoenix appears in the brilliant opening sequence as young Indiana Jones. What a sad waste his death was.",

Now that we made that clear, let's say a couple of things about TLC.Pros: Action, action, and action. Obvious and fantastic chemistry between Ford and Connery. The secondary characters performed very well (especially Marcus and THAT Nazi official). Cons: a 500-year-old knight? C'mon! And the female lead was just terrible.I rated it 8/10That's it, my 2 cents for today. Have a nice day, and remember, there is only one true on-screen hero: Indiana Jones!",

Now, such things may seem like mere pedantry to those unfamiliar with the history of the Grail myths and so forth, but the fact is that the real story of the Templars is much more fascinating than the weak plot of this movie, and decent pulp fantasy informed by the real story would have been just awesome.

            "content": "In IJTLC we're provided with a backstory of the famed archaeologist Indiana Jones. The film opens with a bunch of adolescent Boy Scouts horseback riding through the scorched rocky country of eastern Utah.\nTwo of boys decide on going cave-scouting (one of whom is young Mr Jones) and they happen upon a group of tomb raiders who dig up a golden cross purported to belong to the Spanish conquistador Coronado.\nYoung Indie steals the cross from the fumbling bunch and a spectacularly choreographed chase sequence ensues, involving a moving circus train full of jet-lagged animals.\nYoung Indie manages to escape the clutches of the bandits and takes refuge in his home where his father (played by Sean Connery) absentmindedly acknowledges his hectic arrival while remaining mostly absorbed by an ancient literature book.\nThis interlude gives us a perspective on Indie's integrity and morals present in his from an early age, particularly concerning artifacts and anything of historical significance.\nThe sheriff arrives and Indie hands over the cross only to realize a moment later that he'd been played. It must have been his first lesson of the workings of real life.Years later we meet now a matured Indiana Jones rocking precariously on a ship at stormy sea somewhere off the coast of Portugal. He's been caught red-handed again by the same leader of tomb raiders, only this time he wouldn't be so easy on him as he orders his henchmen to throw Indie overboard.\nAfter some impressive stunts, Indie manages to get away from the goons just in time so when a barrel of fuel is swept by the crashing waves hits some crates on the deck, the ship explodes and is swallowed by raving waters.\nIndie has finally retrieved the cross and this times it's going to a museum because, well it belongs there...After this escapade we find Indiana at his official work place at the Marcus University (or was it a museum?). He's giving a lecture to a roomful of dreamy-eyed students who seems to take every word he says at face value. The girls appear to be especially enthralled by him and his reputation.As he walks them through the essence of being an archaeologist Indie stresses the fact that in real life 'X never, never marks the spot'.\nAs Marcus Brody walks in, Indie wraps up the lecture and dismissed the class. Indie presents Marcus with the recovered cross.\nAs he sneaks out the windows of his office he's confronted by a group of well-groomed men who take him to Walter Donovan who tells him that his father, Jones Sr. had gone missing after searching for The Holy Grail, using an incomplete inscription from a stone tablet as his guide.From here on out the action really takes speed. We're surprised-as well as Indie- to find that sometimes X does mark the spot.\nThe action takes us to various places across the world in a similar fashion to that of previous Indiana Jones movies.\nMuch can be said about the visual effects of the movie, but it would just as well suffice to say that they are stunning.\nThere's a good measure of funny lines and preposterous situations and cliffhangers, which only adds to the overall appeal of this adventure picture.This installment revolves around the Holy Grail and the quest for it, a race of good against evil. At the height of WWll Adolf Hitler's minions are dispatched to locate the Holy Grail. This movie takes advantage of the widely-circulated high tales of Nazi occultism and their various secret paranormal projects, ranging from flying saucers to telekinesis.\nMuch of the film's appeal lies not in the plot but in its child-like charm. It's adventurous, it's daring, it's fast-paced, but most of all it's wonder-full.\nIf you were to scratch the surface of its convincingly plausible story-line, you'd disperse the magic of it all by finding it utterly laughable on the premise of how historically cliched and inaccurate it is. The mcguffin in this film, which is the Holy Grail, is simply that- a mcguffin. If you don't know what a mcguffin is, I suggest you look up Alfred Hitchcock's definition of it in the form of a little anecdote.",

            "content": "When \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" appeared, it defined a new energy level for adventure movies; it was a delirious breakthrough. But there was no way for Spielberg to top himself, and I wish this was the last film in the Indiana Jones movies. That being said, I still consider the Indiana Jones movies just as a trilogy. And as a third and final movie, it's a blast.Even in this third adventure, some of the key elements are recycled from \"Raiders.\" This time, Indy's quest is to find the Holy Grail, the cup Jesus Christ is said to have used at the Last Supper.(To drink from the cup is to have eternal youth.) The Holy Grail reminds us of the Ark of the Covenant in the first film, and in both cases the chase is joined by Nazi villains.The new element this time is how Spielberg fills in some of the past of the Jones character. We learn his real name (which I would not dream of revealing here), and we meet his father, Professor Henry Jones, who is played by Sean Connery on exactly the right note. This is basically ever father character done right, and the banter between these two is to a key. Dr. Jones is not a parent so much as a grown-up ally, an older pal who lacks three dimensions because children are unable to see their parents in that complexity. Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones again this time, and what he does seems so easy, so deadpan, that few other actors could maintain such a straight and credible presence in the midst of such chaos. After young Indy discovers his life's mission in the early scenes, the central story takes place years later, when Dr. Jones (the world's leading expert on the Holy Grail) is kidnapped by desperados who are convinced he knows the secret of where it is now hidden. He does. And Indy, working from his father's notebook, follows a trail from America to the watery catacombs beneath Venice, and then to the deserts of the Holy Land, where there is a sensational chase scene involving a gigantic Nazi armored tank.What Spielberg has done is to take many of the same elements, and apply all of his craft and sense of fun to make them work yet once again. And they do.",

After all, he is Indy. Unfortunately for him, the only man who can and must help him is his father, Sean Connery (I think his name's Henry in the movie, but I honestly can't remember).Spielberg is back in form here, after the horrid `Temple of Doom' sequel. `The Last Crusade' brings Indy back to where he belongs, with deserts, Nazis, and the Indiana Jones `feel.'You see, the `Temple of Doom' sequel was so miserable because not only did they try to turn the Indy character into some sort of super-man, but they also tried some elements that just did not work. When I say this, I mean the sidekick (`Shortstuff' \u0096 a very forgettable `pal'), the location (Some jungle out in Africa, was it?), the plot (Cults? Wasn't the original film about artifacts? Shouldn't they stick to what worked?) Et cetera\u0085This Indiana Jones movie, however, gets back on track, like I said before. It just `feels' more like an Indiana Jones movie.Harrison Ford is (once again) completely believable as Indiana Jones. As I said in my `Raiders\u0085' review (which can be found on this same site), Ford's character is not as gungo-ho as the stereotypical adventure hero. We feel he carries out his missions with a smug smirk because he is \u0096 simply \u0096 Indiana Jones, and that is what he must do.Sean Connery is excellent as Indiana's father, completely convincing as an ex-adventurer who still has it in him for one last go as a daredevil. A Scottish father for Indy may seem a bit weird, but really, is it?John Rhys-Davies returns to his `Raiders\u0085' role with a warm welcome \u0096 he is still utterly loveable and moving as his character.And then there is young River Phoenix, who makes a small appearance in the beginning of the film as a teenaged Indiana Jones. I love the entire beginning sequence, because not only does it give us a glimpse into the background of the Jones character (motivation behind it all, etc.) but also, we find out how Indy got his nickname (Phoenix walks into the Jones residence and we find out his pet dog's name is Indiana).And then there are the great locations, cinematography and excellent tongue-in-cheek gags that may not be as good as the original film, but to me, finalize the Jones chapter in concrete.That is why I am a bit sad to hear another sequel has been planned. It will be nice to see Indy again, but is it really necessary? I think that at Ford's age \u0096 sixty-something \u0096 Ford will come across as more of a cripple than any hero. Still, I'll be one of the first in line to see it when it (eventually) comes out. I'd have to give `Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' 4.5/5 stars. `Raiders of the Lost Ark' gets 5/5, and `Indiana\u0085Temple of Doom' gets 3/5.Kudos to Spielberg, Lucas, Ford, Connery, Davies and Phoenix, plus all the others who made the trilogy what it is today.4.5/5 stars -John Ulmer",

In the tradition of the cliff-hangers of the 40's and 50's cinema, Steven Spielberg keeps us rocking and rolling, on the edge of our seats, nail-biting and cheering during this movie's duration.  From the beginning glimpse into Indy's past (with the wonderful, late River Phoenix) to the heart-stopping ending, this movie doesn't ever drag or lag like so many action movies these days.  We don't have to endure boring lengths of ho-hum dialogue in order to \"cut to the chase,\" on the contrary! I remember watching this movie for the first few times (and I can't even count the number of times I've re-watched and enjoyed it) and thinking to myself, \"I don't think I'll ever tire of watching this over and over again.I especially love the banter between Indiana and his father, it's corny and goofy and hilarious, and you get the absolute sense of mutual respect and love between the two, despite their bickering.  Sean Connery adds a wonderful flair to the role of Henry Jones Sr., a bit fusty and musty but up to the challenge of \"keeping up with the Joneses,\" and he and Harrison Ford play against each other very well.The rest of the cast is up to the challenge as well, Allison Doody (what has happened to her?), Denholm Elliott, John Rhys-Davies (\"You are named after the *dog*?  Ah-ha-ha-ha!\"), Julian Glover, all are just super as well.Even though it's been 13 years since it's release, I don't think this film, or the other two in the Indiana Jones series, for that matter, will ever be \"dated\" or cease to be a joy to watch.  Should there be an \"Indiana Jones 4\"?  Well, this movie has left mighty big shoes to fill, it's one of the few movies that I truly feel deserves every single one of it's ten (10) stars.

            "content": "The third installment of the \"Indiana Jones\" series is another epic ride through human civilization's most ominous mysteries, especially one that awaited for centuries a modern scholar with the intrepidity of a knight, to unveil its treasure. \"The Last Crusade\" deserves such a religious title because religion and esotericism have always been part of Indiana Jones' quests, though he insists that facts are what matter the most, you can count on Spielberg and Lucas to mix up these almighty facts with the most thwarting oddities.\"Temple of Doom\" was perhaps the most outrageously over-the-top while depicting the heights of barbarity reached by mysticism, but I liked it for these specific reasons, it was like Spielberg wanted to push his character even further than in the first film, getting rid of conventional enemies like Nazis and putting him in such a hostile territory never would a theater's seat feel so comfortable and cozy. I suspect \"Temple of Doom\" wouldn't have been as successful had it stuck to the original format, and I suspect \"Crusade\" wouldn't have been successful if \"Doom\" wasn't made that way, because its the kinship with the first film (proving that Spielberg and Lucas heard their detractors) that provided the premise of a back-to-roots Indy, with more fun and outdoor escapades than these dark arenas where hearts were removed and monkey brains eaten.This is why \"Crusade\" didn't exactly excite me like the first or the second, it had too many d\u00e9j\u00e0- vu inducing moments and the quest for the Holy Grail, while beautifully set-up and supported by convincing historical data, had too much resemblance with the \"Ark Covenant\" MacGuffin. It was obvious we were being served a different meal with the same ingredients though less spicy than the second opus. But the film took five years to be made, and Spielberg and Lucas checked many scripts before finally picking the 'Crusade' one, they didn't make any sequel, they knew they add to inject some novelty. Had they kept the sidekicks, Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott), the Nazis and the supernatural quest, the film would have been a pale copy of \"Raiders\", but back then, there was a movie veteran who knew how to steal scenes and give them a fresh air. He had just done it with \"The Untouchables\" and he was doing it again with \"Crusade\". As Henry Jones Sr., Sean Connery plays the iconic adventurer's father, he's like a Victorian straitlaced teacher, who cannot have the name of God said in vain, who can slap his boy and call him 'Junior', and the best thing about it, is that Indy doesn't rebel.It takes forever to get them together but when Ford and Connery appear on the screen, the chemistry is immediate because Ford has this particular ability to play heroes without really feeling like a hero, he's just a guy who does his job, trying to overcome the obstacles one by one, but his father, is one figure he can't overcome. He makes his father feels like one, and in one facial expression, the cool hero becomes Daddy's boy. Jones Sr. reveals new dimensions in Indy himself, as a boy who's been transmitted the passion for science, history and discipline, and this contrasts so well with his easygoing nature that we feel like the best discovery about the film isn't the Grail, but Indy.So, despite my previous criticism, I consider this film as triumphant as the others because it did exactly what we expect from sequels, going back to the roots, the film opens with a fine opening sequence, with the late River Phoenix playing young Indy, he takes a cross stolen by grave robbers, and over the course of a thrilling chase on a speeding train, we discover the origin of Indy's scar in the chin, his scare of snakes, his legendary fedora, his father being one of these sacred figures he can't conquer and last but not least, that over the course of science, some things are worth being abandoned because there is more to learn in the intangible.It does feel corny but trust Spielberg and Lucas, they know where the action is leading. They provide great sequences that have nothing to envy from the first ones, from the catacombs of Venice to the Middle-East Desert, aboard a speedboat, a zeppelin, a plane or a tank, the two men fight with their skills and weapons and Henry Jones Jr. has a few shining moments while remaining true to his character. Connery didn't want to play a kind of goofy and mad scientist, but more of a respectable figure who'd be responsible for Jones Jr.' being. And we finally get it at the climactic moment where for the first time, he calls his son by his first name, and Ford's reaction is the film's emotional reward. I take any conventional action sequence if it leads us to this.So, this is what I take from the film, the magnificent bond between the Joneses, and the casting of Sean Connery, although slightly older than Ford, was the best possible homage to the own adventurer he played in his youth, the iconic James Bond. Ford was no newcomer in 1989, but there's a great torch-passing vibe in the film that makes it all worth to watch. Indy might not have taken a trophy with him but he discovered more in this adventure than all the previous ones. It's a sort of coming-of-age story with clearly Lucas' stamp here, unless I'm reading too much by seeing some Luke and Anakin Skywalker's vibes between the two., or am I just having fun mixing two cinematic myths, concocted by two great filmmakers, two big boys who never forgot that we all are someone's little boy or girl. Maybe it's in this film, that we can understand the secret of Spielberg and Lucas' appeal",

I remember when the movie came out and they showcased this scene, saying how it was all done in a real water chamber, but the result is very claustrophobic and doesn't feel like a real boat at all (again unlike Raiders!) Things get better when Connery is introduced but thereafter it is all slapstick humour. While Raiders had some very funny scenes, it was still quite a dark movie and it had contrast, Temple of Doom was basically a kids movie but still had a dark theme, but Crusade really doesn't let up at all on the funny one liners. Indy's love interest is also easily the blandest of them all The music in the Crusade is also quite irritating.. Raiders had lots of music too and John Williams is well known for his Mickey Mousing, but here it is taken to extremes and there really is hardly a quiet moment, even the final poignant scenes with the Knight aren't left untouched If you've never seen Crusade then it is still a must see, I'm still fond of the movie and give it a 7 but for vintage Indy and a true classic, Raiders is the only one in the series that measures up",

It's also the installment that really got me into the character Indiana Jones and I wanted to emulate him. I really liked the dynamics between the characters, especially with Indy and his father. Their interactions between them was humorous and yet heartfelt in all the right parts. As a matter of fact, they got the humor right this time around. It's placed in all the right parts without it feeling like it's forced. The twists and the set pieces was spot on. And it really did bring about that authenticity while still carrying on that torch of it being a fun adventure film. There is also a lot more going on in this film with most of the main cast playing a part when it comes to the core of the story.

He should expect the usual double crossing, mysterious twists and hair-raising adventures as the first two films made him used to.As the most recent (and coincidentally longest) Indy Jones movie, this could well be the one best suited to my times. Unlike it's two predecessors, this one doesn't open in the action and as such has time to develop a more engaging and well planned out story. For the younger audience, it even tries to add on a little morality lesson at the end about resisting the lure of evil and letting go of things we cannot change. Possibly being the most recent, it has probably the most convincing, well filmed action sequences too (well, not quite up to the standards of TTOD perhaps, but still very good...) As for Ford's performance, he's still a rather wooden actor, but because of the extra emotion involved in the story, here he gets a chance to display some more taut scenes which he manages adequately. Because of Connery's stubborn refusal to drop his Scottish accent, he even has to manage one himself at one point and he certainly sounds more Scot than French, which he appears.Coming onto The Last Crusade's home page, I noticed it is in the top 250 and I even noticed a reviewer who said it was the best film in the series. Dare I say it, I agree with him, the one film with the most satisfying combination of a good story with some fine action scenes and certainly fine Bank Holiday Monday entertainment. ****",

            "content": "(This review contains some spoilers.)Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade has the best script, the best action and the best characters of all the Indy films. Raiders of the Lost Ark is good too (and Temple of Doom is horrific), but Last Crusade shines the brightest of the original three, mainly because of the pitch-perfect father and son chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford.The plot sees Indy (Ford) once again involved in a global quest to find a mythical MacGuffin - this time being the Holy Grail, which is by far the best of the Indiana Jones items (far more fleshed out than the Ark of the Covenant, and far more interesting than the Sankara Stones). However, this time he has to also journey with his dad, Henry Jones (Connery), and evade the Nazis, who, of course, want the power for themselves. Indy and his dad have to battle Germans, survive booby-traps and tie-up personal issues if they want to stop the evil forces from claiming the cup of everlasting life...Right off, the opening (like the two films before it) is thrilling and enjoyable, and gives our titular protagonist some backstory. After that, we are introduced to Walter Donovan (Julian Glover), a wealthy art collector who hires Indy to find the Grail. We end up in Venice, and after meeting Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), we are immediately thrust into a eerie search in an underground catacomb, followed by a high-speed chase through Venice docks. And the pace and action never let up from here.At the start of the Second Act, we finally are introduced to the film's biggest asset - the heartwarming and humour-filled chemistry between Connery and Ford. There is also a fourth-wall joke in this, as Connery of course played James Bond, and the Indiana Jones series was inspired by the British spy's adventures. Back to the film, and the entire middle act is made up of non-stop action and wit, from a Austrian Castle, to a Mountain-side chase, to Berlin, to a Zeppelin, to a Plane chase and, finally, the huge tank chase through the desert.It is some of the most entertaining action stuff in the world, although if Connery was not here it would not be half as good. As the ending closes in, it is surprisingly (and brilliantly) not more action - after all, after the Tank chase another big fight would finally lead to utter exhaustion. Instead, the climax is emotion-driven, with Indy racing through the booby-traps of the Grail, in order to save his father. The traps are clever and twisty, and the ultimate resolution ties up all loose ends. And, of course, we get another horrific villain death in the form of, this time, rapid ageing and disintegrating. Great stuff, and it didn't have to be as graphic and disturbing as Temple of Doom to do it.The main villain is, ultimately, weak, and the plot is serviceable but a little everywhere, but Last Crusade by far my favourite of the trilogy (although I can understand the grand-standing opinion that Raiders is better, and the idea that Temple could be considered better is outrageous). The brief love-story may stumble, but the near-perfect script, acting and action are impossible to beat. The pacing is swift and fluid, the variety in locations is everywhere, the comedy is brilliant and witty, and, of course, the pairing of Connery and Ford as father and son is just amazing. Most of the film is them together, and there is never a dull moment. A well-deserved 9.0 out of 10.Content Advisory: Sex: Some kissing, love story.\nViolence: Lots and lots, but mostly light, several instances of blood (through far less frequent than Raiders and Temple). A man is beheaded near the end, and many explosions. The tank chase has three brief instances of injury detail.\nScare factor: The Venice catacombs scene is filled with rats and skeletons, and is dimly lit, making it eerie. The traps at the end are perilous, and the villains death is rather disturbing and horrific. Other than that, slightly tamer than Raiders and miles less scary than Temple.\nSwearing: Damn, one incorrect use of Jesus Christ (which is then called blasphemy by the characters in the film).\nOther: Mild smoking, mild drinking. Deals with Nazism, through lightly.Best Quotes: \"He choose... poorly.\"\n\"I'm sorry son... they got us.\"\n\"My son would not be so stupid... wait, you did?\"\n\"No ticket!\"Best Moment: The Grail Knight at the finale.\nWorst Moment: Elsa and Indy's love scene.Thank you for reading.",

'The Last Crusade' is a mix between the two: there were moments I really enjoyed, and then there were moments when I just rolled my eyes.This installment is more like a James Bond film than its predecessors, until the final act when it reverts back to the Indiana Jones adventure genre. How does everything so conveniently fall into place for the characters? Indeed, just like a Bond film...Credibility has always been an issue with the Indiana Jones films. I believe they disregard reality entirely and substitute it with events that are for effect only, and sensationalism. I mean, nothing here is believable - and its not even (entirely) a fantasy film. The humor is downright silly and the film therefore can't really be taken seriously. Some scenes are pure slapstick or so unfunny that only Americans will find them funny. Despite being a movie making genius, Steven Spielberg sure can be childish sometimes...The film offers loads of action and adventure, with some incredible action sequences. Unfortunately the ever-present humor ruined the suspense of some of these scenes. For me, the film only redeemed itself during the final act - with stunning locations, interesting sets, booby traps, horror, and relentless killings. In the end, 'The Last Crusade' turns out to be quite an exciting adventure. Sean Connery was the highlight of the film (for me). The man is brilliant and a legend!",

He follows some clues with an attractive woman, gets followed by some bad guys who know what he's is searching for; cue hammy hi-jinks and you know the drill. The antagonist believes he will acquire eternal life if his drinks from the chalice and he must snatch it before Jones can.

            "content": "This is one of my top 10 favorite movies ever for sure. I actually like it better than Raiders even though I think raiders is an all-around better movie.What makes this movie so special is the chemistry between Indy and his father. Although I loved Marion from raiders, I firmly believe that Henry Jones Sr. is the best Indy sidekick of all time. Their relationship is sorely missed in the other movies. Just like the other two original Indy films, Spielberg made sure that this movie felt practical and real. Even though it may seem like a small thing, having real rats in the library scene went a long way. That scene feels much more real than the cgi ant scene from Crystal Skull. Spielberg also included real practical action. This meant real tanks, real horses, and real explosions. There is some cgi that doesn't really hold up (i.e. The plane scene) but for the most part the action is totally practical just like the other two films and it is awesome.The main complaint about this film is that it is too much like Raiders. Although it looks and feels similar, the actual story itself is quite different from Raiders. The characters also encountered a lot of new things in this movie and went to different locations that Indy had never visited before (i.e. italy, Germany, Austria). In fact, besides the desert locations, decaying temples with traps, the return of some old characters, Nazis as an enemy, and the search for a famous Christian artifact, there really aren't as many similarities between the two movies as people say. Except for those five similarities, almost everything is different or is at least done in a way that feels different.To be honest, the Indiana Jones villains have never been particularly complicated. They're all one-dimensional assholes who want to capture a famous artifact before Indy does. Donavan is not a bad villain but is nothing super special. He's exactly what you'd expect from an Indiana jones film. Sure, they could've fleshed him out a little more and made him a more interesting character, but whatever.I loved the return of Sallah and Marcus Brody because it gave the movie that classic raiders feel again. I also liked the fact that these characters are in this movie because it made Indy feel like an underdog. Brody in particular was a total fish out of water. They were kind of shoehorned in but they added to the story rather than taking away from it. I liken them being in the movie to C-3PO and R2-D2 being in the Force Awakens. Was it necessary for them to be in it? Not at all, but them being in it added to the movie and made it feel more like Star Wars.This is also by far the most funny Indy film to date. All of them have had their comedic moments but this one has some of the best. The majority of the film is lighthearted fun but, whenever a serious scene comes along, like when Henry Jones Sr. is shot, the jokes instantly go away. My main complaint about the film is that it does go a little overboard in some scenes, but, for the most part, I enjoy the humor. That was clearly added into this movie just like all of the raiders similarities in order to counteract the dark, depressing atmosphere of Temple of Doom. I actually love temple of doom, but I like how this film feels more like an Indy movie.Overall, this is an incredible film and I love it to death. I just hope Indy 5 recaptures the spirit of the original films like this one.10/10 Grade: A+",

            "review_title": "If you going to see this movie, then you had chosen wisely. Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade is the holy grail of adventure movies.",
            "content": "While, 1981's 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' & 1984's 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom', were all-great movies on their own right. 1989's 'Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade' was indeed my favorite of all those films. It had everything. Great action, wonderful humor, amazing special effects, powerful message, and a beautiful climax ending. It was a nearly a perfect movie. Directed by Steven Spielberg once again, the film tells the story of Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), this time, teaming up with his father, Henry (Sean Connery) in order to protect the Holy Grail from the evils of Nazi Germany. Without spoiling the movie, too much, this film is without a few flaws. One of the biggest complains about this movie, is how much, this film copycat the plot of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', down to a tee. Not only does both films have Indy search for biblical artifact, but also has a rival archaeologist/businessman that sympathizer with the Nazis in order to achieve power. This time, it's Walter Donovan (Julian Glover). No matter what the similarities are, with this plot and the first movie. I just have to say, the story is a lot better than some of the ideas, that writers George Lucas, Jeffery Boam, and Menno Meyjes were originally thinking of, like Indiana Jones exploring an \"haunted mansion\". That doesn't sounds like a 1930's serial, pulp adventure novel at all! Also, thank God, Spielberg didn't use, producer, George Lucas original idea of having Jones, look for alien skulls. We wouldn't get that, mess, until years later, when 2008's 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' came out, disappointing audiences everywhere. That would be horrible plot to end the original trilogy. While, Lucas's other idea of having Indy look for the Monkey King sounds ridiculous on the surface. In truth, it could had been an interesting film, if made. Regardless, there were a lot of new things that this film has to offer its viewers, as well. One of the better parts of the film was the action opening with River Phoenix playing a young Indiana Jones, trying to escape from some grave robbers via a passing circus train. That was a lot of fun. It was also very well told, as so many Indiana Jones's trademarks, were explain in 10 minute. During the filming of that sequence, producer George Lucas saw the potential of a prequel series. He would soon develop and produce, 'The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles', an American television series that aired on ABC from March 4, 1992, to July 24, 1993. Another innovative thing that the film has to offer, is the father/son relationship between Henry Sr. & Indy. The way, they interact with each other, both with body language and dialogue was amusing to watch. Of course, Harrison Ford as Indy was amazing, but who knew that, Sean Connery could be so funny!? He was wonderful in this role. Even, returning actors like Denholm Elliott as Dr. Marcus Brody & John Rhys-Davies as Sallah were equally as great in their small roles as of the original. Sadly, not all sidekick roles in this movie was remarkable. I was kinda disappointed with Indiana Jones teaming up with Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody) in the first part of the film. For a character that supposed to be archaeologist, she seems more like a stereotypical dumb blonde bimbo who really doesn't helps him in any way. She's pretty much there to be the required love interest & damsel in distress. Another thing, I didn't like about Elsa, was the character's twist toward the middle. Without spoiling it, too much, all I have to say, it very obviously that she's not playing with the right team, here. You can clearly see that, a mile ahead in the beginning. I thought, the movie could had done, better to make the character's seem more, heroic than what we got in the film; so that, her betrayal would hold more weight & be more emotional; rather than predictable & generic. Talking about broad. Like the original film, the villains in this movie were portray as cartoony over the top pure evil, rather than complex individuals. While, I wouldn't say, this is a bad thing, seeing how the sheer presence of Michael Byrne as Nazi Officer Vogel was just as good as Gestapo agent Todt (Ronald Lacey) from the first movie. I do think, a little more character development could be needed to fill in, some of the huge plot-holes of this film, has, like why the Nazis would be looking for the grail, if they can't bring it back to Germany, due to the Great Seal. It would be, pretty hard for the Nazis to control the temple, seeing how it's in the Hatay State. They weren't even close to Turkey, by 1939. Even in the height of WWII, Germany was nowhere near close in invading Syria. In the end, it felt a bit confusing. Thank God, we got the music by composer, John Williams to distract us, from that large plot-hole. Once again, the soundtrack was beautiful to listen to. The cinematography by Douglas Slocombe at the many exotic locations was also breathtaking in visual standards. There were so many iconic well-shot memorable scenes that it make me, want to visit many of these real-life sites in Utah, Turkey, Jordan, Italy, Germany and Spain. Overall: This movie was absolute blast to watch. Still, watchable, even today. Highly recommended for anybody seeking the call to adventure. A must watch.",

One day, Indy receives in the mail his father's diary of all his research and soon realizes that he would not send this to Indy unless something was wrong. The theme throughout this movie shows how a father and sons relationships can be so strong with one mission in common; finding the Holy Grail. Another film that demonstrates a father son's relationship is Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner. Indy and a local museum owner Marcus Brody, played by Denholm Elliott, travel to Venice in search of Henry. After countless fights, battles, and struggles, Indy is reunited with his father. One thing that I found frustrating with this movie was that the action scenes were so loud and was constantly having to turn the TV down. When it was a calm scene with just the characters talking, I could barely hear them and had to turn the TV back up. This may have been just my version on the movie but I was constantly turning the volume up and down. Indy is told before he leaves for Venice not to trust anyone and learns that very quickly. Indy and his father have to fight to find the Grail themselves with a small amount of help from a few pals. They soon find the temple that holds the Grail after following Henry's clues and research from his diary. As they enter the temple, they find Donovan and Dr. Schneider, who were supposed to be working with Henry as a team to find the Grail. Donovan uses Indy as a chance to get the Grail for himself and use it for his immortality. Donovan shoots Henry and tells Indy that the only way to save his father is to go through the traps and find the Grail. Knowing that his father's diary gave tips and keys to defeat the traps, Indy makes his way through the traps and reaches the Grail chamber successfully. He must choose wisely among a room filled of ancient artifacts as there is only one correct cup. Dr. Schneider chooses one of the cups and gives it to Donovan, fills it with water, and drinks from this ancient cup and soon ages to death. Indy finds the correct one and takes it to his father. Indy pours the water on Henry's wounds and makes him drink some of the water. Henry's wounds are healed. After a quake breaks out, the Grail is lost in a crack and Henry insists on leaving it behind. Indy, Henry and his other two pals ride off into the sunset.Overall, this was a very good movie and I would highly recommend it to everyone. I honestly didn't think I was going to like it and have never seen any of the Indiana Jones. I am glad that I watched this movie. Through the power and importance of a father and a son's bond and love, anything can be accomplished and by sticking together through hard times, it builds a relationship and can make it stronger.",

            "content": "Learning of a Nazi plot to steal the Holy Grail, archaeologist Indiana Jones sets out to stop them, a quest that leads to him working alongside his estranged father in this second sequel to 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. Sean Connery is well cast as Indy's father, with very natural banter between them and there are some great action sequences - most notably a fight on a wooden boat being crushed by a propeller. Nothing quite matches the riveting opening few scenes though in which River Phoenix plays Indy as a lad with bits and pieces that explain his fear of snakes, love of whips and iconic hat. Many curiously regard this as better than 'Temple of Doom', yet for all its flaws and Kate Capshaw's shrillness, the second movie feels like a motion picture of its own whereas 'Crusade' is more of a rehash of 'Raiders' than a tribute to it. The plots are near identical, with Nazi bad guys and a Biblical artifact McGuffin, and neither 'Raiders' nor 'Crusade' can match the non-stop action thrills and humour of 'Temple of Doom' with most of the comic relief this time coming from Denholm Elliott being turned into a bumbling old man. All three films are technically well-made and riveting at their utmost best. As popular as 'Last Crusade' is, personal preferences will likely determine whether one likes it the most of the original trilogy or not.",

            "review_title": "Shamelessly enjoyable; the quintessential adventure film",
            "content": "Unlike most movie serials, for which sequels generally prove to be reluctant, hackneyed affairs, the Indiana Jones series proved the exception - after the consistent quality and inventive charm of the first two, the series practically begged for another follow-up. And why not? After all, Harrison Ford's rugged hero was already a public icon, and had made his way into cinematic history, and it seemed that the masterful teaming of director Steven Spielberg and producer George Lucas could do no wrong, without question knowing how to deliver an intelligent but still supremely entertaining film. Therefore, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was born, and quickly eclipsed the previous two installments, ending up with an almost note perfect adventure romp.Any viewer familiar with the first two films should well know that the film unavoidably doles out handy helping of storytelling clich\u00e9 and stretches credibility and realism... this is, after all, an Indiana Jones movie, and such complaints are instantly brushed aside as the viewer gives in to the sheer sense of unashamed fun and adventure. The film, like the previous two has a timeless sense of enjoyment which never seems to lessen, no matter what age or generation the viewer is from. Although it might be passed off as a 'kids movie' by more jaded viewers, you would have to consciously try not to enjoy yourself when watching Last Crusade. The legendary Spielberg returns to what he does best here, as his seamless direction raises the series to new heights. John Williams' iconic score couldn't be better, or more fitting, and adds to the enjoyment of the film tenfold. And while Temple of Doom, the last film in the series, may have gotten caught up in its own dark drama perhaps a bit too much, the airtight script for Last Crusade never presumes to take itself too seriously; remaining suspenseful yet incessantly enjoyable, with tons of endlessly quotable punchlines (it would be a surprise indeed to hear that any prospective viewer had not at least heard of the \"You were named after the dog?!\" line). But do not be fooled into thinking that simply because this is the most tongue in cheek film in the series that it descends simply into bawdy comedy throughout - the film retains, if not improves upon the political tension and suspense of the prior two, while improving upon the salty wit which has made the series so lovable. Harrison Ford is on top form in his career defining role, and it still remains to see if Ford will ever boast a stronger performance - his Indiana truly is the definitive adventurous rogue. But the main reason the film is set ahead of the previous two in quality in the end, boils down to a single name: Sean Connery, who shamelessly walks away with the film, playing against type as Indiana's absent minded professor father. Connery's comic timing is perfect to a tee, and he and Ford show unparalleled charisma - the scenes of them bantering back and forth, most memorably when tied to a flaming chair, are among the most enjoyable moments ever committed to celluloid. The two protagonists are given excellent support from the ever lovable Denholm Elliot, returning as constantly baffled Doctor Marcus Brody, and the brilliant John Rhys-Davies, reprising his role as robust guide Sallah. Julian Glover and Michael Byrne make for suitably menacing adversaries, though they toe the line of just plain campy a bit too often to be truly effective. Allison Doody also drifts over the top in her \"femme fatale\" role, but proves peerless in the \"creepy and obsessive\" front. Watch also for a tiny role from River Phoenix, perfectly essaying a young Indiana Jones in the film's superb flashback opening sequence.Although the Indiana Jones series has spawned countless imitations and rip-offs, this is without question the penultimate - the indisputable high point of the genre, and Last Crusade is arguably the strongest of the three Jones movies, perfectly blending adventure, comedy and suspense all without missing a beat or faltering in the slightest. It only takes a few notes from John William's unforgettable score to ensnare the viewer, and melt whatever cynical defenses they may be clinging to, infecting them with the sheer sense of fun. The film has a replay value like no other, and never is the sense of unbridled enjoyment dampened in the slightest, no matter what age of the viewer or how many times they have already seen it. If you are among the few having yet to experience the classic adventure epic that is Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade - suffice to say whatever expectations, you will not be disappointed. -10/10",

            "content": "\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" is a good, very entertaining film. The acting is a plus, with convincing performances from the entire cast. The character development is well done and even adds another facet to the title character. The chemistry between Connery and Ford proves to be a highlight of the film, creating a solid emotional depth that is enhanced by the comedic moments between the two.However, the overall hilarity is mixed, between forcing plot conveniences for laughs and sometimes mediocre dialogue. The supporting cast could have been developed a bit more, but ultimately serve their purpose, and some of them prove important to the progress of the story even in their limited playing time. The motivations are also mostly clear. This makes the resolution largely satisfying and provides a fitting conclusion for each character.The protagonists' story arcs are also admirably written. The film's reference to various historical events and people actually works and makes the film more exciting for the viewer.The script is largely grounded in reality and focuses on exciting car chases and other action sequences that make the protagonists look even worse than before. All of this builds tension that the characters must overcome.The opening scene could have been written a little better, though, as it answers questions that didn't necessarily need to be asked.The CGI in some scenes detracts from the experience, but the practical effects are fine for the production.The score by Williams and the sound do an amazing job of supporting the film's development, punctuating each scene perfectly.All in all, this film is a worthwhile and adventurous addition to the Indiana Jones story.",

            "content": "With added character depth by bringing in Indiana Jones' father to the story, 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' may be the best film of the original three concerning the college archaeology professor-turned adventurer.While the character of Indiana Jones is intriguing just based on his knowledge, courage and bravery, the fact is that the character had very little depth before 'Crusade.' But by bringing in his father, in a brilliant casting move with Sean Connery, the audience gets to see this part of the character fleshed out. If Spielberg and Lucas had gone ahead and made a third Indy film without additional character development, then this movie could have very well not been critically acclaimed as it was.Truly, much like Alec Guiness did with Jedi legend Obi-Wan Kenobi, Sean Connery, in half a film, made an unforgettable character. His banter with an equally good actor in Harrison Ford is some of the best and most amusing two-person dialogue that you will find in a movie. Equally good was the idea to tell a brief earlier story about the younger, teenaged Indiana Jones. While short, the story satisfyingly told about how Indy gained much of the quirks that makes his character- the hat, the whip, the scar, the fear of snakes. For these reasons, adding the character depth and background to an already-loved character, 'Crusade' is the best Indy film.Additionally, Allison Doody is wonderful as femme fatale Elsa Schneider. Boy, is she gorgeous. She is by far the best-looking love interest. Additionally, her character was intriguing in being a double-crossing agent- only to be conflicted at the end due to her affections for Dr. Jones. Another key element that made 'Crusade' so entertaining was the use of several locations- from Venice, to an Austrian fortress, to Berlin. I mean, Indiana Jones meets Adolf Hitler! What a smart, and clever move, to invite an interaction between both real and fictional famous figures- one for fictional good, and the other for literal evil.The casting, improved story, lighter tone compared to 'Temple,' and fleshed-out character background make this the best Indy adventure heading into the anticipated 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' release.",

Together they search for the Holy Grail and try to outwit the Nazis (which leads to other humorous scenes, particularly one involving a priceless diary and Adolf Hitler).Fast-moving, colourful, high on tension, and with a fun opening section with Indy as a teenager (the much-missed River Phoenix), this film finished off the saga brilliantly, and the tension between Jones Senior and Junior is both fun and sentimental.",

This one has the benefit of the characters being, mostly, pre established and the introduction of 'Senior' Jones, although gimmicky, works very well, unlike the kid and the blonde in 'Temple Of Doom'. They obviously had more time to work on the script and think carefully about what they wanted to achieve in this film.'Last Crusade' definitely gets the series back to form and the story is very good once again. However there are a few odd moments I notice as I watch, inconsistency's in the continuity, but I find it easier to ignore it in this one, as the film overall is so good.As the original, I believe that 'Raiders' probably wins the competition to be the best of the four, but this is a close second.I love the comedy that Denholm Elliott's, Marcus and John Rhys Davies' Sallah bring here along with the father-son relationship between Junior and Senior Jones. Elsa isn't as annoying as Marion or as screechy as Willie, but she does lose points for being a \"bit\" naughty.There's beautiful scenery throughout and great use of River Phoenix, even if it was only to introduce a new series to make George Lucas even more money.The search for the Holy Grail has never been portrayed better.

            "content": "Speaking of the action-adventure films of the 1980s, or the representative of entertainment blockbuster, there is no doubt that it is the trilogy of the treasure hunt. Many of the post-80s people may be like me, and they have been named for a long time. Finally, by the spring breeze of the fourth strong attack, I observed the first three steps.\nThe adventure films of the cold weapon era, unlike the 21st century adventure action films such as national treasures or other entertainment movies, the biggest difference must be that there are basically no computer stunts, even if there are, it seems to be a piece of cake today. Too.\nSecondly, I found that the films used to like snakes, worms, and ants. The trilogy is full of a variety of disgusting small animals. Could it be that people's aesthetics were like that?\nThird, the heroes of those years were all solitary heroes of single horses, and all of them defeated a large group of people alone, reminding me of the gallant dragon and the mighty, and there are many action movies of that era, all in this mode. . It seems that Jackie Chan still taught a lot to Hollywood.\nFourth, the movies of that era were still dominated by patriarchalism. The male pig's feet must have been an iron camp, and the female ones must have been running soldiers. One episode of the movie changed for a heroine, and like the movie of 007, it never explained where the heroine of the previous episode went. Moreover, the male bishop still pretended to be a long-lasting affectionate, as opposed to Xinhuan in the new movie. Still the 21st century movies are more humane. Look at Spider-Man. The three films are monogamous. At best, you can play with the emotional little waves in the teacup. There are also adults from Shrek and pirates. One good example after another. In the cold weapon era, love is cheaper",

The part that we were in was when the soldiers were marching around a large fire and Indian Jones bumped into Adolf. The funny thing is that the books that was being thrown on to the fire were actually old British Telecom phone directories. That fire was extinguished about ten times by a fire brigade every time the scene was stopped and re-lit when they were ready for another shot. The building used for the Adolf/diary scenes was also used near the start of the film when Indiana is pursued by the students to his office and he climbs out of the back window. I was able to get very close to Harrisson Ford and Steven Spielberg the time they shot the scene when Indiana went to retrieve the diary from the blonde Nazi (sorry I forget her name).

The film is a quest to foil Nazi plans to get a hold of the grail to obtain eternal life and Indy must stop them in addition to save his father with whom his relationship is poor.Unlike \"Temple of Doom,\" \"Last Crusade\" goes down the religious artifact path that \"Raiders\" used to launch Indiana Jones into the mainstream of iconic characters and great Hollywood films. While these films are more about the action and the humor and Harrison Ford anyway, at least unlike \"Temple of Doom\" the plot is not so absurd that it detracts from those elements to an extent.Connery as Jones' father adds another humorous aspect and depends Jones' character. More so than ever, we get a sense of who Indiana really is, not merely what he does and why he does it. The opening scene with River Phoenix as young Indy is not only clever but truly telling of the famous hero.The action sequences, Ford's persona, and the cleverness of it all never disappoint and for that to happen in the third installment of a series is simply outstanding. Indiana Jones will forever define adventure and the series' imprint on Hollywood action film-making is solidified more than ever in \"Last Crusade.\"",

This time the stakes are even higher for the Axis of Darkness is after the Holy Grail, a fountain of eternal youth, and they have also taken his father, who has quested after the Grail his entire life.In many ways this is very similar to Raiders of the Lost Ark. We have Nazis, a Judeo-Christian artifact to save, mostly European and Middle-Eastern locations, tough as nails love interest, and so on. And yet it is different enough and even better enough that these small similarities don't drag the movie down. It's one of those few sequels where it's strengths are both its similarities and its differences from the original classic.And there are more than a few good reasons for it. First of all, there's Sean Connery playing the role of Henry Jones Sr. and he is fantastic. Charismatic, wise, a bit kooky in an academic manner and a clear template for what would be Indiana Jones. What's more, his chemistry with Harrison Ford allows us to see a new side of Indy. There's bitterness between the two, but also respect, dependence and love. Ford has always been the shining star of these movies, and here even more so.Second of all, Spielberg keeps on improving upon his craft. Watching these movies back to back, you can see that Raiders has a few bumps here and there as they were still learning the character and even the very genre. Nothing major, it's still a fantastic movie, but in my opinion The Last Crusade is the superior film. It is a nigh flawless adventure film no matter how you want to look at it. The only way to make it better would have been to bring back Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) and make her even more of a badass than she was before.But even without her we have chases, fist fights, libraries, tombs, ancient mysteries and even something mythical lurking just over the horizon.

Mr Jones (senior) is a very selfish man who cares only for his research, knows nothing about the world and the people in it, including his own family. Michael Byrne has great fun as a nasty Nazi. Alison Doodys eyes give her character away as what is important to her-herself...but I wont spoil it for you if you haven't yet seen it. Julian Glover has his usual polish performance and always makes a good villain, but again \"me me me\" is all important to him and he willingly lets others do his dirty world. Not clear WHY Hitler would want the \"Holy Grail\", given that he destroys everything \"Jewish\" and the Grail cannot leave where they find it. All of this said, its a fun film, entertaining which shouldn't be taken too seriously. John Rhys-Davies doesn't have as an effective part as in the 1st one, but always good to have him in a film for what he adds, this one is no exception. Speilberg has done much better with other films. not one of his better ones in my view",

            "content": "Indiana Jones is now on a search for the Holy Grail in the third slot of Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones' trilogy -- that is, until the terrible Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull came along. Suffice to say, the Holy Grail is not really the most important thing in this film. It is a pretext for a series of unlikely adventures and misadventures that includes an Arab cult, rats, a crusader's tomb, Nazis, secret passage ways, zepellins, a Pasha with a passion for automobiles, an unlikely battle with a tank, and a temple with boob-traps that could only have been put there by the all-mighty God, who (judging from the film) has a really dark sense of humor.Now very little of this Indiana Jones movie makes sense. For example, would the British really allow Nazi soldiers to march about freely in Egypt (which was then a British colony)? Probably not. But in director Spielberg's film, the Nazis roam about Egypt like they own the place. But that's not the part of the film that I object to. We already grown accustomed to this idea that \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" is not a serious adventure film.The problem with this movie is that it has too many action scenes and the overwhelming majority of them are boring. I am tired of watching chases. I am tired of the explosions. I am tired of pointless machine gun battles. I am tired of watching Indiana Jones best a German tank. And yes, I am tired of seeing Nazis being reduced to two-dimensional characters whose only purpose in life is the be evil bastards (which unfortunately is what Spielberg does all too often in his films). To his credit, Spielberg tries to make the action scenes more interesting by having Indiana Jones' father (played capably by Sean Connery) make fun of some of the action scenes. \"This is not archaeology,\" he tells Indiana. But such humor only goes so far and the temptation is to skip through the action sequences as quickly as possible.Where Spielberg does succeed is in creating truly exotic sequences. I will not spoil anything, but suffice to say there is a sense of wonder when Indiana Jones walks though a chamber with artifacts or an old ruin. If Spielberg focused more of his attention on that, instead of the shootouts, the explosions and the silly chases, then he probably would have ended up creating a better picture.",

            "review_title": "I enjoyed the film but I would definitely not call it the best of the three",
            "content": "My Rating: *** out of ****. It is rare when a third film in a trilogy ends up being the best. In fact, they are mostly the weakest in the trilogy. Look what happened this year with Matrix Revolutions. It made 150 million dollars at the US Box Office when it was expected to do a lot better. It was not well received either (I gave it a *1/2, although I am not a \"real\" critic). Unfortunately, while The Last Crusade is very entertaining, it also proves that the third film ends up being the weakest. It is a satisfying, worthwhile conclusion to the trilogy but it disappoints in a few areas. Raiders of the Lost Ark is rightfully hailed as one of the best action/adventure films ever made. When it came out in 1981, it was a huge Box Office Hit and received many Oscar Nominations(including Best Picture and Best Director). Three Years Later came its sequel/prequel: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. It was not as well received. A lot of people complained that it was too dark and violent(some say that film is the reason we have the PG-13 Rating, it certainly deserved it). The film did well but it left some fans cold. It would be five years for the third and hopefully final Indiana Jones film. The Last Crusade was better received and did better at the Box Office. Fans were happy and some consider it to be the best.  Yet but if you think about it the plot of The Last Crusade is just the Raiders formula with a few minor changes. Even if you hated The Temple of Doom, it at least did something different. Spielberg and Lucas took a chance with Temple of Doom and when they were criticized they backed away. They went with the easy money formula for the next film. Recently, I just watched The Last Crusade and I actually found the beginning to be kind of sluggish. The early action scenes are especially low on tension. The train sequence and the boat ride in Venice are competently done by Spielberg but they are not that exciting. The Rat Scene has a lot more tension than those two action scenes(I hate Rats), although it is not as suspenseful as the snake scene in Raiders. Its when Indy arrives at a castle in Austria(I think its Austria) that the tension goes up. The action scenes from then on are exciting. We get to see Indy's Dad(a Delightfully Entertaining Sean Connery) and the sluggish feel is pretty much gone.One other complaint I have with the film is that the tone is too jokey. Some of the attempts at humor are not funny. I was amused when Indy's Dad accidentally shot their plane with the machine gun. However, I was not amused by many of the other attempts at humor.  Harrison Ford is in top form here. He has been perfect as Indy from the beginning of Raiders all the way to the end of this film. I will through a fit if he does Indy 4 though(He is waaay too old). However, Ford is nearly matched by Sean Connery as Indy's Father. His performance here may not be his greatest, but he is wonderfully entertaining. However, the villain is a disappointment. Julian Glover just cannot play a good villain. He was passable in For Your Eyes Only but will never be remembered as one of the best Bond villains. Julian Glover is adequate but easily the worst of the Indy villain. Michael Byrne is effective as Colonel Vogel(the villains side kick type) but even he will not be remembered.\nThe girl is another disappointment. Alison Doody is completely forgettable as Dr. Schneider. Kate Capshaw may have been a little annoying but she was certainly better than her replacement(although this maybe considered to be Karen Allen's replacement, its kind of confusing). I kind of wonder why Karen Allen was not brought back. I would have welcomed her with open arms.\nNevertheless, despite the flaws I mentioned this is still worth checking out. It brings the trilogy to a satisfying end (It better be the end!!!!!!!!!). Really, The Last Crusade is just the Raiders formula put to effective use.",

It has the same impeccable combination of action, adventure, reverence, romance, and perfectly-timed humor as the previous two films, but it has one thing that elevates it above the rest: Sean Connery!Harrison Ford is once again excellent as Indiana Jones, and Sean Connery is outstanding as Dr. Jones Senior. In real life, Ford and Connery are only 12 years apart, but yet they were so believable as father and son in this movie. The banter between them was absolutely delightful.The plot is very intriguing. The Nazis return, and this time they are after the Holy Grail. The story moves along at a brisk pace, and the message of this movie is very well done.You can always count on Indiana Jones to give you thrilling action scenes. This time, we get a boat chase, a plane chase, and a pulse-pounding battle involving tanks. I also enjoyed the flashback scene with Indy as a kid.Another thing, the ending scene with them riding off into the sunset was absolutely spellbinding. It was the perfect way to cap off the series. Too bad this wasn't the end of the series.For me, this is the peak of action/adventure cinema. My favorite Indiana Jones movie, and one of my favorite movies in general, this is highly recommended.RATING: A+",

The former achieves a seemingly unattainable cinematic perfection, and not matching or eclipsing that is hardly\u00a0to be considered a\u00a0flaw. What it does achieve is actually almost as impressive. While it does return to a basic Raiders aesthetic (Nazis, Christian artifact), Last Crusade strikes a much different tone. Mixing humor (that never undermines the stakes) and heart, it manages to feel both familiar and yet unique.I love Han Solo, but for me Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones, and he's in top form here. It helps that he's paired with Sean Connery, with whom he shares an almost preternatural chemistry. The two make for a dynamic duo as they race across the globe to save the day.The action is fun, the writing crisp and the performances sharp. In short, Last Crusade is\u00a0a classic in its own right.",

            "review_title": "Indiana Jones and the perfect third movie",
            "content": "The second Indiana Jones film, Temple of Doom, was quite successful but received a lot of criticism for being overall too dark , much like Tim Burton's Batman Returns. No such complaints were needed for the third installment: whatever angle one looks at it from, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is perfect from start to finish.As in the previous films, there's a mandatory opening scene that features great action and shows just how cool Indy is. However, there's a twist this time around: the prologue concerns the young Indiana (River Phoenix), and so the first fifteen minutes of the movie are spent revealing where he learned to master a whip and why he is so afraid of snakes. More crucially, though, the extended beginning shows a not-so-good relationship between the boy and his father, Henry Jones Sr., a theme that is brought up again with the more familiar Indy (Harrison Ford): he is asked to by an American millionaire (Julian Glover) to participate in an expedition whose aim is to retrieve the legendary Holy Grail. \"You've got the wrong Jones\" Indy quips, only to discover his old man (Sean Connery) is the leader of the expedition and has mysteriously disappeared. Enter a globe-trotting adventure that will involve rats, Venice, the desert, Nazis, the return of Brody (Denholm Elliott) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) and lots more, all told in the classic B-adventure style we're used to.Last Crusade is considerably lighter in tone than its predecessor, and therefore much more fun, with one set-piece after another, state-of-the-art visual effects and brilliant characters (Temple of Doom basically had only Short Round to brag about). In particular, Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), while no match for Marion Ravenwood, is a more intriguing presence than the quite one-dimensional Willie Scott from the second flick, being at the center of one of the terrific script's greatest inventions (and given the film was released in 1989, it's some achievement they actually got away with it - you know what I mean if you've seen the movie).Ford is, of course, as excellent as he was in the other two Indies, but Crusade's real treat is Connery. His casting started as an in-joke (Spielberg said Indiana Jones was his version of James Bond, therefore Bond should be his father), but he lives up to expectations engaging in one hell of an acting duet with \"Junior\", their conversations being packed with wit and warmth. Given the director's recurring use of father/son themes, there was a slight risk those scenes could come off as too schmaltzy for an Indiana Jones picture, but thankfully the Henry-Indy relationship feels completely natural and unforced, never once overshadowing the massive sense of fun that derives from the movie.Perhaps the best way to describe the spirit of these films is a wonderful scene where Jones Sr. and Jr. react to being hunted by Nazis. \"These men are trying to kill us!\" the elder Jones remarks. \"I know, Dad!\" comes the answer. \"It's a whole new experience for me!\" Henry adds. \"Happens to me all the time\" Indy says before heading out to continue seeking the Grail. That's Indiana Jones: always in trouble, always willing to go all the way. And he pulls you in with him.",

            "content": "After the enjoyable but rather soulless Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Spielberg returned with a story similar to the original Raiders of the Lost Ark for his third Indy flick. The Nazis have been re-instated as the bad guys, Jones is once again in pursuit of a biblical artifact of extraordinary value and power, and to add to the proceedings Indy's father is also cast into the mix. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a lightning-paced adventure movie which refuses to let up for its entire duration.Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), fresh from retrieving the Cross of Coronado after a lifelong hunt, is approached by rich entrepreneur Walter Donovan (Julian Glover) who wants him to lead a search for the Holy Grail. According to biblical legend, anyone who drinks from the Grail will be blessed with eternal life. Jones points out that he is perhaps not the right man to be selected for the quest. His father Henry Jones (Sean Connery), has spent his lifetime piecing together clues to the whereabouts of the long-lost Grail... so Jones Jr suggests that Jones Sr might be a better candidate for the job. Unfortunately, it transpires that Henry has already been working on the hunt for the Grail and has mysteriously disappeared in Venice. More than a little worried for his father's safety, Indy sets off for Europe with the dual objective of finding the Grail and his missing dad. The trail leads from Venice to Germany, to the Middle East, where Indy and co. learn that the Nazis too are keen to find the Holy Grail (presumably to immortalise their war-mongering army).Highlights include a thrilling speedboat sequence in Venice; a tank chase in the desert; glorious interplay between Ford and Conery; and an exciting ending in a booby-trapped cavern. Placed into context, this is probably the second best of the series (\"Raiders...\" was just a bit fresher, and featured a stronger female character in Karen Allen - in this one, Alison Doody's role is sadly a bit on the lightweight side). John Williams' instantly hummable score is as rousing as ever, and the pacing is so fast that there is rarely a moment to spare. Best moment in the film? A Nazi soldier on a motorcycle closes in on the Joneses, who are on a slower motorcycle of their own. Unable to shake the pursuer, Indy jams a pole in the front-wheel spokes of the Nazi's bike, throwing the Nazi rider spectacularly in the air. Indy laughs - clearly impressed with his improvised escape - while Henry fiddles with his pocket-watch and flares his nostrils with disapproval! Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade is the big screen equivalent of a roller-coaster ride... so strap yourself in, whiten your knuckles, and enjoy the ride!",

Indy uncovers part of the secret in a catacomb in Venice, then rescues his father from a Nazi fortress in Austria, only to discover Donovan is working for the Nazis. The race is on to reach the Grail before Donovan and his henchmen.The third Indiana Jones movie for me is not quite in the same league as the first two, but is still a tremendously entertaining action-packed adventure film. The problem for me is twofold. Firstly, the father-son relationship, which is made the prime focus of the action and drama. I like my mythic heroes pure, uncluttered with pasts, commitments and families. I don't want to see them trying to rationalise their imperfect childhood with their absent father. Who gives a good goddamn about that ? Secondly, the villains - villains in escapist entertainment should be evil through-and-through. Glover is too bland and Doody's character is all over the place - one minute she's a villainous femme-fatale Nazi and the next she's having moral dilemmas ? However, there is much to enjoy here - the opening sequence featuring Phoenix as a young boy-scout Indy is fun, as is the rat-filled catacombs speedboat chase scene, and the brilliantly-staged finale in the tomb of the Grail. There are also some very nice comic touches, like the scene where Hitler unwittingly autographs the diary the characters spend most of the movie fighting over, or the moment where the Joneses are in a biplane being chased by Messerschmitts and Indy yells, \"Dad, eleven o'clock !!\", to which Dad replies, \"What happens then ?\". Connery is a bit hard to swallow as Indy's Dad (too young and not remotely American), but his performance is surprisingly subtle and effective. This is a Steven Spielberg movie, and so of course is hugely enjoyable and visually brilliant, but I'm afraid for me it's not nearly a patch on Raiders Of The Lost Ark. A rollicking good flick nonetheless though.",

In my opinion, this deserves the 8.6 rating, simply because it keeps you interested more than any of the other two.A great movie, lots of action and a few classic moments, and please Mr Lucas, bring them out on DVD. Video just isn't good enough I'm afraid.",

I'm not saying I agree with them - I don't - but I can see how such a case would be made.  Could anyone reasonably make this claim of the third Indianna Jones?  Hah!  The idea is absurd.The first two films have a single narrative thread.  Their before-the-credits establishing scene really does establish something (and both scenes are very well staged, unlike the analogous scene here); and thereafter it is one SINGLE roller-coaster ride (almost literally, in the second movie).  Here we have a series of merry-go-round spins.  I'm not saying that this doesn't have its moments.  It does, and I enjoyed them. But they've been stitched together in the most unconvincing fashion.  This means that when a scene falls flat - and be honest, it DOES happen - it REALLY falls flat.Furthermore, the music isn't quite as good the third time around.  Nor were the settings.  It's incredible that a paid scout searched all of Europe and came up with locations as drab as these.  I've already mentioned that the script was weaker than before.  But this is all tolerable; what REALLY lets the film down is the concluding sequence in that temple place.  I've seen game shows that had more class.  Some think that the inspiration for the series of inane riddles Indy must solve did indeed come from some tacky game show; but I know better.  I'm willing to bet that either George Lucas or Jeffrey Boam was once a dungeon master, used to leading characters like rats through a maze in precisely this fashion, with precisely this set of contrived puzzles and silly booby traps.  The cheesy fake rocks and fairy-floss cobwebs set it all off perfectly.And another thing: Indianna Jones is beginning to look like a bit of a dill. This is the third time he's started out sure that a fabled artefact wasn't really magical, only to find out that it was, after all.  (I don't know how many times this pattern repeats itself in the television specials.  I have more sense than to watch them.)  Doesn't he learn from experience?The third Indy film still puts up a good show, don't get me wrong, but it can't compete with its predecessors.  Spielberg and Lucas should quit while they're still ahead.Sorry.  I forgot those television specials again, and the proposed fourth movie ... should HAVE quit while they WERE still ahead.",

            "content": "I liked this film, and had a good time watching it with the family in the theatre. Harrison Ford brings us the world renowned archaeologist and hands-on scholar Indiana Jones, Stanford University professor extraordinaire. The great score by John Williams, the ever surpassing and respectable direction by Steven Spielberg, the good performances by the usual suspects, including Harrison Ford himself, are woven into a visual fabric that brings us what everyone thought might be the final installment of the Indiana Jones' series of cinematic adventures.If I had one criticism with this film, and I don't have many, it would be the same observation I had with \"Temple of Doom\", and that is I think there may have been one too many effects' shots. I say that guardedly because most of what we see are live action stunts, but there's a few sequences that call attention to themselves, and not just because they're effects' shots either. Example; I think I would have preferred to see real live Messerschmitts' fighting over the Bavarian Alps as opposed to American Warhawks dressed up as German fighters, and miniatures thereof, doing acrobatics over the Midwest (meant to represent North Africa I suppose). But, how much would it have cost? That's the whole purpose of special effects; to bring to the audience that which is too expensive or impossible to deliver through live conventional means. As such, even here I don't fault the film too much.Sean Connery's take on Indy's father was unique and unexpected. I think most everyone was expecting a tough guy performance from Connery, but instead we get very much the academician, though he seems to come around by the film's end (much to the pleasure of all). The films' execution itself seems quick and dirty, despite some of the lengths that were gone into dressing up sets and locations. The film has a kind of roughness to it in spite of all of the refined elements gives it an edge.I think the real thing that I missed from \"Raiders\" that lacks in the subsequent four films, is that as Spielberg stated on the bonus DVD in the Indiana Jones trilogy DVD set, is that unlike \"Raiders\" the other films had a contemporary look to them in terms of camera work. Spielberg stated that in a conversation with his DP that they were going to give \"Raiders\" an old fashioned look. And that strategy works magnificently for the kind of film that it is and was meant to be. I think that element is missing in the followup films, and I think they suffer some for it. An old fashioned movie needs an old fashioned feel, because quite honestly it heightens the experience, and, to my way of thinking, added a nice finishing sheen to the visuals to make \"Raiders\" look more authentic and artistic. But that's just me.\"Last Crusade\" is still a fine film. Worthy of a night's viewing.Enjoy.",

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade got everything right: it had the perfect comedic duo in Harrison Ford and Sean Connery; the action topped just about everything that had occurred in the previous two Indy films; the narrative returned its focus to the ultimate villain (Nazis) and once again had the fate of the world resting squarely on the shoulders of the rugged archaeologist who was the embodiment of all things good. Last Crusade helped solidify the notion that stellar sequels are, in fact, possible.Just about everyone has seen this, so allow me to focus on specifics. The score is every bit as classic as it was the first time we heard it in Raiders, and the bits designed specifically for this offering are, all-in-all, equally as memorable. The \"booby traps\" are spectacular (especially the \"devices of lethal cunning\" that Dr. Jones must navigate during the final leg of his journey); the decision to begin the film with a flashback of Indy in his youth is a stroke of genius, and River Phoenix perfectly imitates Mr. Ford's most subtle mannerisms; and, of course, there's the previously mentioned presence of none other than the original James Bond himself.Connery is, for lack of a better word, the perfect foil to Ford. Whereas Indy is often reckless and tends to dive into dangerous situations headfirst, Henry Jones Sr. is calm, collected, and every bit the logical sage one would imagine the father of Indiana Jones to be.If there's any spot where Last Crusade falls short of Raiders it has to be in regards to its leading woman. Don't get me wrong: Elsa is a great double-crossing she-devil. But superior to Marion Ravenwood? Negative.Next up is Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. That's right. The fridge is about to be nuked.",

They took the \"buddy movie\" concept away from cop films and based the film on the hugely funny Indiana-Dad relationship. Sean Connery and Harrison Ford positively spark on screen as the combative Jones'. The Nazi element which makes sure all the cinema-goers will boo in unison means that the \"baddie\" is as bad as they can get. Basically Indy and the armies of darkness are involved in a desperate quest to be the first to locate the Holy Grail, the cup that Jesus Christ used at the Last Supper. His old friends Marcus Brody and Salah - wonderfully played by Denholm Elliot and John Rhys-Davies - are back and this gives the idea of a trilogy being completed and thus is the end of the saga. I am not sure that resurrecting the series for a 4th film so many years after The Last Crusade is a good idea, just look at Blues Brothers 2000!",

Only this time, they are in search of the Holy Grail and kidnap Indy's father (Connery) who holds clues on its whereabouts. Indy just wants to save his father, but gets more than he bargained for. I don't like picking a \"worst\" in the trilogy, but if I had to, it would have to be this. While it is evenly proportioned like the first, the level is not quite as high. I guess that is why this is raved as being the second best. While this does have a more complex story than Temple of Doom, the action and thrills are not at it's level. As I said in Temple's review, it's action and thrills are among the best in the series. If Raiders has the best story and Temple has the best action, where does that leave this? The acting is great in all movies at the same level, so that's not it. I'm not knocking this, I loved Last Crusade! The complex story, suspense, comedy, filming, effects...with all these properly placed in a movie starring cinema's greatest hero, what could go wrong? I would also call this probably the best ending to a series. Aside from Return of the King and Return of the Jedi, this is the best one. Spielberg and Lucas intended on this being the last one. The movie is called \"Last Crusade\" for a reason. And they go out in a blaze of glory! After catching the Holy Grail (which is now a synonym for the biggest kahuna), Indiana Jones, his father and friends strode off on their horses into the sunset. That is the perfect ending! It could not have gone better. Nineteen years later, Spielberg reluctantly makes a fourth instalment. Although enjoyable, it is not a part of this trilogy. Not to me.",

Anyway, I came to Lord Sean Connery.\nThe plot is compact and coherent, the logic is rigorous, and it is done in one go. The fighting scenes and the chasing scenes are also very exciting. You ca n't stop watching if you want to stop.\nThe beginning of the film is a very classic train chase and fight plot, Rui Fan Phoenix's performance is quite brilliant, many people think of the Phoenix River forever.\nThis movie has added comedy elements, making it into an adventure treasure hunt comedy movie.\nThis film can basically be summarized as the story of Jones and his least tacit dad and pig teammates adventure treasure hunting. The father and the son took risks and laughed along the way to seek reconciliation, and the pig team dragged their feet behind to deal with bad things friendly. Of course, in the end, there must be a happy ending. After watching all the comedy, no one wants to end the tragedy.\nThe film once asked Tom Stoppard to rewrite the dialogue between Jones and his son, no wonder that the dialogue between them is humorous and interesting.\nThe comedy bridge and laughs of the entire film are focused on the relationship between Dr. Henry Jones played by Sean and the curator played by Denholm Eliot and the father and son of Jones.\nI didn't expect Sean to have such a strong talent for comedy. Henry Jones was all smiles. Wearing a round hat, matching glasses, plus a leather bag and an umbrella, this outfit is also amusing.\nWhen Old Jones appeared, he treated his son as a Nazi, and later distressed that the porcelain of his son was broken. After discovering that it was a fake, he laughed and laughed. This father is really no one. When his son discovered that his father was not distressed, he was filled with that helpless disappointment.\nSo the father and son embarrassed and did not tacit understanding of the adventure began.\nThe son asked his dad to use a lighter to burn the ropes that bound them, and the result was a self-defeating fire, which triggered the fire while avoiding the fire. The father and son sat in front of the turning door and looked at a house of Nazis.\nWhen there was no way to escape, my dad shouted and said that he would sit down and think about it, which just touched the exit mechanism, so his son crawled to the exit. I have to tremble with a smile when I write here.\nWhen his son cleverly got rid of the Nazi chase on a motorcycle and looked happily at his father, he hoped to get a response, but the old Jones wiped his glasses boringly. He didn't feel anything exciting.\nThe son dragged his dad away, but the dad always slowed down.\nFinally, he and I got into the airship, and finally the father and son could start the warm chat mode. The dad sat with his eyes wide open and waited for a chat with his son, but the son found out that he really had nothing to say to his dad. He could only talk about work.\nThe gap between their father and son is that the father thinks he knows his son very well and thinks he is the second himself. The son does not need him. The son felt that his father had never cared about him, and he always ignored himself.\nIn the end, Old Jones changed his name to \"Indiana\" instead of \"Junior\" in order to wake up his son.\nAlthough it is the father and son with no tacit understanding, it is definitely the best father and son CP.",

            "content": "In 1988 Steven Spielberg was deep into bringing Rain Man to fruition, all thoughts of Indiana Jones had gone by the wayside with the harshly judged part two, Temple Of Doom. In stepped George Lucas to politely remind Spielberg that they had an agreement to make another Indiana Jones picture, Spielberg no doubt obliged and humble, passed on his Rain Man work to Barry Levinson who promptly bagged himself an Oscar for the film. It can be guessed that Spielberg was probably grouchy around this period, but he needn't have worried, because The Last Crusade provided a much needed hit for not only himself (post Empire Of The Sun), but also Lucas (Willow) and Harrison Ford (Frantic).Although Last Crusade follows the basic structure, borrowed from the James Bond series, of the other movies by starting the film with the end of a previous adventure before introducing the main story-line, the film tweaks the formula by showing us Indy's first big adventure.. in 1912 Utah, when the future archaeology professor is a Boy Scout (literally) living with his widowed father, Henry Jones. While on a Boy Scouting sojourn in the mountainous desert, young Indy (River Phoenix) wanders into a cave and sees a group of ruffians pilfering the long-lost Cross of Coronado. \"That cross is an important artifact,\" Indy says to a fellow Boy Scout. \"It belongs in a museum.\" Indy sends his friend for help, steals the Cross of Coronado from the ruffians, but ends up being chased as he attempts to escape on foot, horseback and even a circus train. In this interlude, Indy acquires most of the traits established in the earlier films, his fear of snakes, his affinity for the whip (and the origins of the scar on his chin) and, yes, his choice of the leather jacket and snap-brim fedora.Last Crusade brings all the usual elements that are now expectant of the series. Fights, chases and dangerous animals. After seeing the great but horribly uncomfortable inclusion of the snake in Raiders it was almost equally spine tingling to view Indiana in the tunnel of rats, a squirming sequence that is rattled with action and suspense. As for chases the tank scenes stand out and although lasting a small time the boat sequence in Venice is memorable for some death defying thrills. Far more than an action adventure the inclusion of a mythical legend adds to the dazzle of the film's appeal and if you have seen the previous two then this is an essential watch!Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "Indiana Jones, much like James Bond, is a character that we've come to know so well that he seems like an old friend. Yet, while you follow his adventures you realize that you don't know that much about him. We have followed every step of his perilous journeys for The Lost Ark and into The Temple of Doom, but what of his personal life? We know that he is a professor and occasionally has rotating girlfriends but what of his past? Who is his family? One of the joys of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is that while we're following him on his latest adventure, some of his background comes to light and it helps us to understand some of the insecurities, the vulnerability and the self-preservation of a man that we've come to know like family.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade begins with a masterstroke. It takes us back to the turn of the century and introduces us to young Indy when he was just a good-natured boy scout (played in a wonderful performance by River Phoenix) with a nose for adventure and a nasty habit of getting himself into trouble. When he steals a golden cross from some fortune hunters, we are led on an adventure that helps us understand how he gained his trademarks such as his fear of snakes, his affinity for whips and even the scar on his chin. We also understand his isolation. He was the son of a celebrated archaeologist, Henry Jones (Sean Connery) who was happy to leave him to his own devices, and it's a wound that he carries into adulthood.The larger story, which takes place in 1938, greatly resembles Raiders of the Lost Ark with Indiana being tasked with finding a lost artifact before Hitler and his Nazi thugs claim it for their own. That artifact is The Holy Grail, the cup that Jesus supposedly drank from at the last supper and also caught his blood as he hung on the cross. Supposedly, whomever drinks from the cup can live forever. Indy's motivation isn't the cup itself, but in the fact that the Nazis have capture his father in order to get it. His father worked all his life to find the sacred relic and even sidelined his role as a father to keep the search going.The father-son subplot is wise because the narrative here is your standard Indiana Jones adventure. We have chases, shoot-outs, rescues, escapes, fights, double-crosses, questionable allegiances, mystic artifacts, booby traps, and the series' trademark vermin. For \"Raiders\" it was snakes. \"Temple of Doom\" had bugs. Here it is plague of rats, lots and lots of rats. And there's a gorgeous dam, this time a hard-nosed Austrian named Elsa (Alison Doody) whose accent makes us question her alliance.All of these elements come together in a film that is a great deal of fun. Spielberg and collaborator George Lucas have become experts at this kind of adventure at a time when most action filmmakers are satisfied to go by the numbers. If there is a complaint that can be filed about this film, it is that at this point it is starting to feel a bit familiar. You could argue that if you ran it alongside \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" the narrative structure is basically the same (that wasn't true of \"Temple of Doom\"). The story is less compelling and the leading lady is forgettable.That's why the familial element is so important. Indy's relationship with his father is strained by distance. His father is a spirited man whose eyes dance when he speaks about his craft but darken when he must discuss anything personal. Sean Connery has always been an expert at this \u2013 maintaining a safe emotional distance in his characters, a wall that protects his rugged exterior. The end of the film, in which Indy must traverse a bizarre cavern strewn with coded puzzles, brings the story back around to the family element, to what is more important than fortune and glory than the human element.Yet, all the family stuff does not deter from the fact that this is a fun movie. All of the Indiana Jones movies flow with a quick-snap pace and never get too bogged down in personalities. Yet, it's nice that finally Indiana Jones has been revealed as a person and not just a pawn in an action setting. By understanding his past, we better understand a person that we've come to know like an old friend.",

The cup motif, as well as its being an object that caught the blood of Christ on the cross, seems to have been an invention of later, thirteenth century Cistercian writers (one writer between the original 1190s tale and the Cistercians, reworking Cretien before they had laws against plagiarism, described it as a stone).What Cretien had in mind for the Grail originally is anyone's guess as he either died or stopped writing for other reasons before finishing his \"novel.\" But certainly the Grail was no cup. It was a covered dish and if you said you wanted a burger and fries you lifted the lid and there it was.The Grail presented here has more in common with Monty Python than anything out of history. And though the Nazis wanted to build a huge arts center in Nuremburg that might have included objects d'art like the Grail (had it existed) it is doubtful whether Nazis, certainly not Hitler (who makes a brief appearance here) would have any appreciation for a cup that held the blood of a Jewish person, which Christ was.But let all the pseudo-historical gobbledygook wash over you and hear a tale of a fateful trip. This movie is an exciting adventure of one darn thing after another (in fact, toward the end, during the tank fight, so much happens sensory overlord sets in and it gets tedious).Still, from Venice (with impossible catacombs since the city was built on marshland by people fleeing Attila the Hun, and it's sinking into the marsh these days) to a Gothic Germanic castle near 1930s Berlin and into the deserts of the post-Ottoman middle east to the city of Petra standing in for someplace else, the globe-trotting Jones boys give us lots of adventure.Old pals are here Denholm Elliot as Marcus in a delightful comedic performance and John Rhys-Davis' welcome return as Sallah. Sean Connery bows into the series as Indiana's dad (and it's a nice and realistic touch that Indiana always calls him \"sir.\") And Allison Doodey (\"A View to a Kill\") makes for a beautiful love interest/femme fatale. Julian Glover (\"For Your Eyes Only\") is not really Mr. Excitement up against Ford and Connery, and is the one weak link in the chain. With wild-eyed, all-purpose bad-guy Nazis who have no reason to live except to be bad guys and the vague, fez-wearing Brotherhood, they should have cast a stronger actor or actress in Glover's role. Glover's an excellent actor but we require someone of early James Bond stature in that part.Nevertheless, in these movies bad guys aren't to be explained. This isn't like the Grinch movie where the Whos are to blame for treating the Grinch badly during his formative years. They're evil for the sake of it, human beings of no depth or dimension who live only to be destroyed, somehow. Hm. And only the Jones boys stand between their madness and sanity.\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" is the best thing an adventure movie can be: a fun ride. With one caveat. I don't like all that \"young Indiana Jones\" rubbish up front. When I watch this movie I spend that time preparing my snacks. Otherwise, it's one of my favorite movies of its genre. Enjoy.",

            "content": "It doesn't have the sense of wonder that \"Raiders...\" had, because the character had already become a movie icon. It's not as breathlessly paced as \"Temple...\" because the makers were working on the assumption that this was going to be the last, so they wanted to tie up some loose ends. I would suggest, however, that if you were to watch only ONE instalment from the trilogy, this would be the one to choose to give you the most compact flavour of what the series is like as a whole (I DON'T recommend you do this BTW. watch 'em all!)Asking me which of the trilogy is my favourite is an easier question than if you were asking me which is the best; \"ROTLA\" is my fave, but every film appeals to different people because of the reasons I've listed above. I'm not going to even try comparing \"The Last Crusade\" with its predecessors.What I can say about it is this: The introduction of Connery as Indy's father is a masterstroke. Actors as icons don't come much bigger than Sean.He works so well with Ford that you never think you're watching \"James Bond\" and you buy the uneasy relationship the two have with each other. I have to say, this is more down to the skill of the two actors themselves than particularly masterful writing, but even so, it never feels false. This is quite an achievement, as it could easily have been deployed as just a one-note gimmick about the hardships of having parents.The opening sequence is terrific; a perfect intro for newcomers to the series, and more back-story for longtime fans. Phoenix was a perfect choice for Young Indy, and I'm sure he would have been the ideal man to step into Harrison's shoes permanently when he decided he was too old for the part. I can't understand why some people complain that it was contrived. The whole series is fairly contrived, relating as it does to the cliffhanger serials from the '30's & '40's. I see nothing in that segment that has a different tone to anything that has gone before it. So Indy climbing into Lao Che's plane at the start of \"Temple...\" wasn't contrived?Some may justifiably complain that the set-pieces are perhaps not what we've come to expect from the franchise, but I feel this is a direct result of trying to introduce a more personal element with the relationship between the Jones's. They're still better than most other imitators in '80s cinema, and by now most of us love the main character so much we'd be rooting for him to thwart a slightly painful verruca... Maybe it is more sedate and less imaginative than its companions, but they were hardly BAD films, and perhaps a change in pace was needed. Still great.",

Much like audiences who have flocked to see these adventure movies he is a changed and grown man, he has more of a heart and more experience to call upon. The movie needed to be more than it's predecessors or I think audiences would have been bored - thankfully this is more than came before, and is perhaps why this is a lot of peoples favorite Indiana Jones film. Alongside Harrison Ford is Sean Connery as Henry Jones Sr, with a supporting cast which includes Denholm Elliott, Alison Doody and even Alexei Sayle... oh and if you recognize young Indiana Jones, that's because it's River Phoenix! Connery and Ford work extremely well together and show why they are Hollywood icons, their double teaming father and son act is fun yet endearing. Steven Spielberg (with George Lucas's writing) have brought yet another iconic film which has stood the test of time and with a John Williams score again, viewers are treated to a masterclass in what adventure films should be like.Fun, adventure, thrills, spills, suspense, comedy, romance, horror... what more could you want!",

            "content": "My Take: A lighter approach than the ominous TEMPLE OF DOOM, this highly enjoyable romp is a highly entertaining adventure.Sequels don't usually live through this long, but the INDIANA JONES series has, and even at the third chapter, the fun with the whip-wielding archaeologist has not run out. In INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, we don't only get Indiana Jones (still played with perfection by Harrison Ford), but we also get to meet his father, the brilliant Dr. Henry Jones Sr. (Sean Connery, a perfect match). Ford and Connery has such a chemistry in the film, and it is perhaps the best thing about it. Seeing Indy getting a little help from dad (who, may I just remind, is played by an actor who used to play James Bond 007 himself) makes such a surprising entertainment for a third chapter in a series that practically borrows the formula used in the first two films.Much like the first film RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, Indy goes up against power-hungry Nazis once more, who this time is in search of the fabled Holy Grail, the cup in which Jesus served with during the Last Supper. Other than his father, Indy also gets help from old buddies Proffesor Brody (Denholm Elliot) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies). They race against time trying to make sure they find the grail before the Nazis do. Allison Doody plays Dr. Elsa Schneider, a historian who may not be who she seems, and Julian Glover plays Walter Donovan.The formula is mainly a rehash of the first film, as it basically pits Indy against Nazis once more. Other than the opening scenes, which features a young Indiana Jones (River Phoenix) in his very first adventure, the film is reworking the plot of the first film, with some several differences. Still, if it weren't the original formula, we wouldn't have loved it as much as we do. The INDIANA JONES series, much like the Bond series, follows a certain formula of its own. We, by now, know exactly how it goes, but thanks to some creativity that fortunately Hollywood producers still have, the movie is fun, and it's not deja 'vu all over again. The movie has a lot of fun with special effects, stunt sequences, but not without providing quality to the characters and edge to the plot.Sequels aren't supposed to be this good. It seemed to have become a rule that sequels aren't meant to be better than the original. INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE has not broken the rule, but even so, this is a very worthy sequel. An original film on its own.Rating: ***** out of 5.",

            "content": "After his father disappears archaeologist Indiana Jones (Ford) sets off to find him and finds himself getting lured into a quest to find the Holy Grail.The third instalment of the quadrilogy defines the term adventure. Fast with some sparkling set pieces and adrenaline soaked action the Last Crusade is one of the finest instalments to the series which has seen its ups and downs.The second part Temple of Doom received criticism for its overly played portrayal of an evil religion juxtaposed with the concept of human survival. This was somewhat far-fetched but nevertheless entertaining and so as part of a deal between director Spielberg and producer George Lucas, this third part was made and if anything was going to numb the critiques of the previous release, then this 1989 adventure sure did.Harrison Ford reprises the role of the most famous on screen archaeologist to wondrous applause with his usual cocky and knowledgeable portrayal of Jones. But what gives him the bit extra sophistication in this part is the encoded symbol of his father Henry Jones senior, played with knowledge and experience by Sean Connery. The pairing works wonders, creating plenty of humour and enough drama to grasp the emotional bond between the pair which brings together a story of survival and belief.Perhaps the most controversial of the entire series, part 3 takes a look at the legend of the Holy Grail, the symbol of everlasting life from biblical times. The journey towards its resting place is undoubtedly entertaining but what is interesting is that it is almost educational as facts are dropped about the legend. Having used the Ark of the Covenant in Raiders of the Lost Ark is followed by an equally in-depth look at God's powers.Last Crusade brings all the usual elements that are now expectant of the series. Fights, chases and dangerous animals. After seeing the great but horribly uncomfortable inclusion of the snake in Raiders it was almost equally spine tingling to view Indiana in the tunnel of rats, a squirming sequence that is rattled with action and suspense. As for chases the tank scenes stand out and although lasting a small time the boat sequence in Venice is memorable for some death defying thrills.Far more than an action adventure the inclusion of a mythical legend adds to the dazzle of the film's appeal and if you have seen the previous two then this is an essential watch The release of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull almost downgrading the reputation this could have been the finest swan song. This should be the moment when the tale of the archaeologist truly climaxed.",

There's still love between them though it's tough. They really play well off each other, the actors that is.

The quest for the Grail, and the much deeper quest for connection between father and son, is so beautifully crafted without being cheesy or over the top. It's the quintessential action and adventure movie that has infinite re-watchability. When I think of pure entertainment at the movie theater, I think of Last Crusade...and the Jones boys riding into the sunset as the credits roll.Also, as an aside, I think Temple of Doom gets unfairly criticized as a \"bad\" movie because it was packaged between two of the best action/adventure movies in film history. Temple is a good, entertaining adventure movie in its own regard, but it had an impossible standard to meet. Had Temple been a standalone adventure movie, I think people would look back on it much more fondly.",

While the pairing of Ford and Connery is worth the admission price alone, was it really necessary to tone back the action to such an extent. At least two action sequences (the underground escape in Venice leading into the motor boat race and the actual climax) prove to be anti-climactic. Suddenly the action ceases and it feels wrong like a plug was suddenly pulled before the pay-offs. Ditto, the final tests that Indy has to pass to get to the Grail are, if anything, lackluster. Also, the villains are exceedingly weak.The storyline resurrects the Nazis as the villains, but Julian Glover's mealy-mouthed wealthy patron is neither as threatening as the cult priest from the second film nor as memorable as the villains from the original. In fact, he is decidedly forgettable. It is nice to see John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliot back from the original, but why are they played suddenly with a slight comical edge that seems strangely buffoonish? And where the heck is Karen Allen? As Temple of Doom was a prequel, it was not expected to see her back in that film. However, this one follows Raiders in the timeline and there is not so much as a mention of her much less an appearance. Instead, we get blond Alison Doody, who is physically striking but plays a badly underwritten role as a sort of female Belloq (from Raiders), who is on the hunt for the Grail and will pair with anyone who will get her to it. She is not likable enough to become invested in nor hateful enough to root for her defeat, and shares zero chemistry with Ford, so she ends up merely taking up screen time. The denouement with her character will have most people shrugging rather than being especially interested. What were they thinking? By the end of the film, we have had a pleasant ride, but one that has not particularly taxed the viewer in the suspense or excitement department, which makes it seem a step backwards from Temple of Doom on that front. By contrast, the stabs at borderline campy comedy and a screenplay that is both less interesting and less intelligent than Raiders, make it pale compared to that film on those fronts. While I love Ford and Connery together and would watch this more often than not I must admit that the Last Crusade as a whole functions as a bit of an anti-climax.",

            "content": "You know I wrestle back and forth with Last Crusade. For a little bit I considered it to be my favorite in the Indiana Jones series. For a time I cooled on it, thinking it to be a retread of the masterpiece 'Raiders' and now I find myself somewhat in the middle. For one thing, it is a retread of 'Raiders'. The plot is followed to the tee, the Nazi are looking for a religious artifact they can't grasp the significance of and Indiana Jones is the force of good in their way. In some ways though I really don't mind this. Spielberg and Ford care enough about their classic hero to merely engage in repetition. The thing that really makes me continue to love 'Last Crusade' is how it follows the best aspect of 'Raiders'. 'Last Crusade' acknowledges the fact that Indiana Jones is a human being beneath the fedora. He can be scarred emotionally and physically. This is evident by not just the relationship with his Father but also his search for the Holy Grail, which really is the pinnacle of finds.I like Nazis as villains and that's why the film didn't feel like a complete retread of 'Raiders'. They fit and represent a great mythological evil. The thought of Hitler holding the Cup of Christ is enough to make any one have fear run down the spine. One thing I think that 'Last Crusade' improves on over 'Raiders' is creating the story of good and evil. The Grail represents a certain spiritual purity and the Nazis want to blacken it. The fact that we are taken to a Nazi rally only adds to our fear. The moment where Indy comes face to face with Adolf Hitler is beautifully staged and acted on Ford's part. That look of terror and disgust in Indy's eyes is classic.\"The search for the Grail is the search for the divine in us all\"- so says Denholm Elliot in a terrific performance as Marcus Brody. I think this really beautifully sums up why 'Last Crusade' is such a great film. In a lot of ways Indiana Jones isn't just fighting Nazis, he's fighting his inner demons. Much is made of the relationship between Connery and Ford. I think there are moments here when Connery and Ford surpass anything they have ever done. Connery provides some needed comic relief but he is much much more than just a sidekick for Indy to bring with on an adventure. There is a great moment where Indy brings up the death of his mother to his father. The thought that someone as suave and strong as Indiana Jones is still lost in the grief over that has very real resonance to an audience. A superhero is only as good as the skeletons in his closet. The Holy Grail isn't merely a trinket, it is the representation of all Indiana Jones has sought to be. In some ways I wish there was more time in between action sequences to really get to know Indiana Jones. He's someone I'd rather have a chat with than go on a gunslinging adventure with(although that would be pretty awesome). Indy confronting his past, his strained relationship with his father, and his vulnerabilities are what makes the search for the Grail meaningful. The last scene between Connery and Ford is probably my favorite moment of the series.",

Every scene in this film has something good, great or fantastic in it. A reason that continues the plot. The fight scenes are good, as is the humor. Old charactors from Raiders of the lost ark returns to provide great preformances. There is nothing bad about this movie. The pace is really good and you always stay focused and in the end you don't want it to end. This is maybe not a masterpiece in many peoples opinions.

            "content": "\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" (1989) is the third installment in the Indiana Jones-franchise which expands a bit beyond the first two movies. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:This movie is one of the stronger - if not the strongest - feature in the Indiana Jones-movies. It is thrilling, inventive, and very dynamic, which when coupled with beautiful scenery and very few instances of obvious CGI produce an adventure to remember. It loves a bigger screen to capture the scope of both Mediterranean and Middle East vistas, and if you have found yourself a fan of the first two movies, you will in no way be disappointed.There are a few things which probably should receive a heads up, however. There are some sexual innuendos that occur briefly, and as the other Indiana Jones-movies, it is quite graphic and violent. Not as much as the first two, but still more than what you would think for an action adventure. Regarding the characters, there are times where the relationship between Indiana and Henry can feel a bit clich\u00e9 and slightly too humorous, but it doesn't distract from the story nor events.All in all, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a pretty straight-forward adventure thrill, that when accepted with its minor warnings keeps the tempo and hardly if ever let's go.Also, they have a freaking zeppelin. A zeppelin.My personal grade: a classic 8/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews.",

To the production people who chose to film in Petra I say more power to ya. My Daughter Julia saw a statue of Yoda at movieland and I told her thats what God is rumored to look like. Julia said that God is cute which joins the list of God is Good and God is Love. Julia was playing Royals in the basement with my Mom.

            "content": "Given that action and adventure is the series' selling point, you can expect the thrills and wondrous delight of discovery delivered in spades. The action scenes are terrific (and matched well with John Williams' rousing, memorable score, also the best of the trilogy), the best being a fantastic ten-minute chase sequence on board (and in) a tank, possibly the best action sequence of Spielberg's career. I also loved the motorcycle chase and the Zeppelin setpiece, where the heroes go about dispatching of two enemy fighters in unexpected, but quite hilarious, fashion. The climax, complete with frightening booby traps, is a suspenseful venture into the unknown.The Last Crusade is far more humor-oriented than its predecessors, but part of the movie's effectiveness is that it's able to deliver belly laughs without defusing the tension during the action sequences. Some of the jokes are just brilliant, including one with Indy armed with a Luger in confrontation with a trio of Nazis on board a tank that's even funnier than the swordsman scene in Raiders (well, to me, at least).The supporting cast is all-around superb; John Rhys-Davies is back as Sallah, wonderful as ever and displaying a bit more enthusiasm searching for the Grail than he did digging up the Ark of the Covenant. The late Denholm Elliot also returns as Marcus Brody, the most lovable goof of a museum curator. Alison Doody is interesting as Elsa, the blonde historian whom Indy falls for; a twist involving her character and her actions towards the climax make her not as one-dimensional as she may initially appear. Julian Glover is the best of the main Indy villains, he's far more menacing than Paul Freeman's Belloq and less over-the-top but equally enjoyable as Amrish Pruri's Mola Ram. I also enjoyed Michael Byrne's performance as the Jones hating Colonel Vogel, who relishes in torturing Indy and his father. When it comes to pure delightfully nasty villainy, Byrne is even more fun to watch than Glover.",

I was really put-off by the whole 2nd because the original Raiders had such a concrete effect on me for positive film learning and gripped my creative mind.As I hesitantly went and saw Crusade with friends, I was shocked at the improvement that had taken place with the third installment. It had literally been great and then very kid-like in number two then three seemed to have a more grown up story that was now in league with the original. There was a broader appeal to me and millions with Last Crusade, and on top of this all the casting of Sean Connery, I was a big fan of but unsure of his placement. As the father of Jones, Connery was sensational! You couldn't get past the accent and his humor, they were genius in that character's development. The line that really was a laugh-maker was when the two Jones's were taken hostage by the Nazi's. Standing looking the bad-guys in the eye... Indiana delivered a 'smasher' ! This was about one of their two other friends, 'Brody' the older Englishman. Indiana stated when the Nazi inquired of Brody's whereabouts,- \"You'll never find him he knows five languages, he will blend in with the crowd, adapt. He knows all the local customs and he will disappear.\" Then as we see Brody in the next scene, he looks about half drunk standing in the middle of a crowd, looking perplexed he inquires, to anyone...\"Does, does anyone speak English?\" The theater roared in laughter. The best for me about this explosive adventure, is that Lucus and Spielberg, again used 'Biblical' story lines. A theme that was tied into the plot that made it even deeper, like the first \" Raiders \" . This one was a vastly different Indiana Jones than I had expected, I love when Lucus and Spielberg put their creative brains together, it works! This is a favorite on my top picks list of all time... see it too and see why (****)",

After tying in the plot we saw in the beginning we are to learn, that Indy's father (Sean Connery) has gone missing while trying to locate the holy Grail, trade mark. So off to hunt daddy and the grail we go, through Venice to Austria to the empire of Hatay.At first let me say, that the chemistry between Connery and Ford is incredible.

The Indy babe of the film is Dr. Elsa Schneider (Allison Doody).What else is there to say, a wonderful action adventure for those who can enjoy this kind of thing.

            "content": "As a nine-year-old kid, during sport's day no less, I passed on the opportunity to go and see Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. My rationale at that time, having seen Raiders of the Lost Ark and been terrified by a scene where snakes crawled out of the mouths of skeletons, I decided that it was bound to include something that would have me mess my pants. And yeah it does include a couple of things that would be scary to a little snot-nosed scaredy-pants kid, but it's actually a much lighter Jones film. If anything it's more a comedy than an action film.In some quarters that's grounds for consternation. Some people think it's far too jokey. They prefer the all-out action of Raiders or the darkness of Temple. But although I can kind of see their point, I think Last Crusade works wonderfully on its own terms. Certainly, with Indy accompanied by his father, it ensures that we're seeing something fresh, that we're not going over the same ground again. And as for the jokes, well, they either work or they don't, and I think they work superbly.For instance, how can you not enjoy the idea of father and son unknowingly sleeping with the same woman? It's a terrible blow to Indy's ego to think that his dad had slept with a hot blonde before him and as well as being amusing it also gives Indy's dad an extra dimension \u0096 at the beginning we think of him as we all think of our fathers, completely sexless, but the revelation here makes him more human and ultimately allows the two characters to bond (they come to understand one another better, realising that they're not quite as different as they think they are).I also enjoy the scene in Berlin where Indiana is confronted with Adolf Hitler. It's a great little moment, played to perfection. And how can I forget the crowd-pleasing moment when Indiana punches out a Nazi officer and throws him out of a zeppelin before announcing that he had 'no ticket'? (By the way, is it just me or does the Nazi officer Colonel Vogel look remarkably like David Gilmour?) However, funnier than all these moments, for me, is the scene where Sallah picks up Marcus Brody at the train station. The two are quickly accosted by a couple of Nazis, who demand to see their papers. Sallah then, while telling Brody to run, produces a newspaper and punches one of the Nazis in the face through it. Honestly, is there anything better in the world than punching someone in the face through a newspaper? I somehow doubt it.I also enjoy the scene where Indy gets his tonsils sucked out by Dr Elsa Schneider. \"Ah, Venice,\" he sighs. And after Kate Capshaw in Temple of Doom, it makes a nice change to have a female character with a bit of spunk. And Dr Elsa Schneider further proves my theory that the best film villainesses are sexual deviants. After all, here's a woman who sleeps with father and son and who cops off with a man as he's tied to a chair. There's nothing not to like about her (let's just ignore her Nazi sympathies).But as funny as Last Crusade is, it does also contain a few wonderful small moments that help elevate it about your standard action/adventure fare. In particular I like the scene where the tomb of Sir Richard is found. The music is wonderful, as is Ford's acting \u0096 \"giddy like a schoolboy,\" says Dr Schneider. And then there's the scene that bookends this where Indy tells his father that he found the tomb. Again the music and the acting make it. And there's also the scene at the end when Indy is dangling over the edge of a precipice while being held by his father. He tries reaching for the grail, but then for the first time his father calls him by the name 'Indiana'. Almost instantly Indy is broken free from the trance he's in and lets his father help him up. It's a nice way of showing that his relationship with his father has more worth than this object they've both been searching for.Another small little moment I like in this film is when the knight who guards the grail is confronted with Indiana. \"You're strangely dressed for a knight.\" Once again the combination of fantastic acting with a magnificent score elevates the film immensely. And I also like the way that after being confronted with his first visitor in 700 years another couple of people turn up. Geez, immortality is like buses. You wait 700 years for someone to turn up and then three arrive at once! However, the film doesn't exactly paint a fun view of immortality. The poor bloke is stuck in a temple for the rest of eternity with only a book and lots of cups to keep him company. How boring would that be? No wonder he has plenty of time to refine his sarcasm. \"He chose\u0085poorly.\" What a great line delivery that is.Where the next film will go, though, to keep things fresh, I have no idea. We've already had elements of science-fiction, musical and comedy, as well as the obvious action and adventure. Oh well, I'll still be looking forward to it. Indy hasn't let me down...yet.",

And thankfully doesn't have a lady that keeps screaming every 5 seconds! My Score:10/10",

            "content": "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the third outing for everyone's favorite Nazi fighting archaeologist, Indiana Jones, except this time around his father joins in on the adventure, Dr. Henry Jones Sr. (played by Sean Connery).The story begins with a small scene where we meet a young Indiana Jones, within this scene we learn pretty much how he becomes the archaeologist we now know, we also learn why he is afraid of snakes. We then flash forward to an adult Indiana Jones (played once more by Harrison Ford), Indy learns that his father has gone missing while searching for the Holy Grail, the cup used by Jesus in the Last Supper. Indy, and his colleague Marcus Brody(Denholm Elliott), travel to Venice, the last place his father was seen. At Venice Indy hopes to learn what has happened to his father. After a few daring battles and such, Indy finally discovers what happened to his father, he is being held captive by the Nazis. Indy rushes to rescue his father from the Nazis, but in turn gets captured himself, and his love interest turns on him here and reveals she is a Nazi. It is here that Indiana learns that the Nazis are searching for the Holy Grail and want to use his father's knowledge on the subject to obtain it. Together, Indy and his father escape the Nazis and begin a race against Nazi troops to discover the Holy Grail before they do. On their journey they are joined by two of Indy's most colorful and exciting sidekicks, Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) and Brody. Together all four of them try to thwart the Nazi army.Last Crusade is yet another fun Indiana Jones adventure, and while I may not enjoy this one as much as the other two in the series, it is still a very worthy successor. Last Crusade is once more directed by Steven Spielberg, who does just another marvelous job. The script by Jeffrey Boam is really good, it may be a little bit more jokey than the first two Indy adventures, but it is by no means a poorly written script. The acting in this one steals the show, in particular Sean Connery as Indy's father is really quite fun and exciting. Then John William's score is just the icing on the top. Everything else: cinematography, art direction, special effects, etc., are perfect.My only minor complaint comes in the fact that they played up the comedy aspect of Indiana Jones a bit more in this adventure than the others, for this reason I found it harder to connect to the characters a little more so than in the first two. After Temple of Doom they tried to lighten up the franchise, and they did very well at that, but I slightly preferred the darker atmosphere of Temple of Doom compared to this one. Still even though I may not have been a huge fan of them adding all of this extra comedy, I must say that all of the jokes and gags are funny, as well the action is really stunning. Each action set piece is as well constructed as any of the others in the other films.Overall it is still a fun Indiana Jones adventure, and many will prefer this one with the added comedic aspect to it. Now don't take this as me hating this film, because I love it, I just prefer the first two Indy films more.A superb 10 out of 10!",

Like when Indy is dangling from the strap of his trusty sidepack from the tank turret...how did that happen?  Why doesn't he just swing out?  Why, after the tank turns, is he all of a sudden able to just hop up and free himself?  Ridiculous.  They really phoned in this entire production.But the worst part:  the boat chase.  There's a couple clowns trying to torch Indy and his woman.  So Indy chases them down, almost getting killed multiple times.  We see the world's worst stunt double, some 80 year old guy with gray hair who looks nothing like Harrison Ford, jump onto the enemy's boat and threaten to kill one guy.  And then...what?  They drop him off on shore?  What was the point of that entire act?Thumbs up to Sean Connery, but why make Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) and Marcus complete imbeciles in this film when they were competent in the first episode?

It delivers such good as great performances by the cast especially River Phoenix as young Indy in the prologue and Jonathan Rhys-Davis as Sallah from the first movie, fantastic special effects like the amazing death of Donovan, action, good stunts, a little romance and of course humor.

            "content": "This is my favorite Indiana Jones movie, because it features great action, cool locations (ah...Venice!), and a highly interesting and amusing father-son relationship.Thanks to the presence of his dad, Indiana Jones becomes a much more well-rounded character in this film than he was in \"Raiders\" and that clumsy disaster, \"The Temple of Doom.\" Sean Connery gives a great performance as Henry Jones Sr.; he's a little camp and silly, but it works perfectly, especially since he's playing against his James Bond image.This movie also benefits from some great jokes, one of which I quoted in my summary line. Other hot ones include \"they don't come any closer than that!\" and \"you call this archeology?\" It's really a quite witty script. My only reservation about the humor is that Denholm Elliott's character becomes a little too dumb to be believed, but that's just a minor complaint.Some people criticize this film because it borrows too heavily from the formula of \"Raiders.\" I can see their point, but I don't really agree. I think \"Last Crusade\" refines the formula and improves it by adding more character development. Also, the ending of this movie is much more satisfying and thoughtful than the deus ex machina conclusion of \"Raiders.\" Oh, and the Holy Grail is really the ultimate artifact - thanks to the King Arthur legend, I think it has even more resonance in our culture than the Ark.This is one of the last populist action movies that I really care about. It comes from a time when plots and dialogue were considered as important as special effects and spectacle. I guess you can blame Spielburg and Lucas for inspiring a lot of dumb imitators, but it's hard to criticize them when their actual work is so good.",

This is the last Indiana Jones movie that I have to comment on, well, until the next Indiana Jones movie will come out, and I far as I know it is coming out in 2008. Anyway, let us talk about this movie. This always had more humor than Raiders of the Lost Ark or Temple of Doom. I am also glad that Sallah and Marcus Brody were in this since their departure in Temple of Doom. I thought that this had better music than Raiders of the Lost Ark or the Temple of Doom. This movie is almost perfect and it tells us that a sequel can be better than the original. Actually, the Empire Strikes Back told us that but still. Not everything is good about this film, though. The plot is a bit hard to follow and it is harder to fit into words, but I am definitely going to try to fit it into words.Here is the plot. Indy is sent by Walter Donavan to go to Venice to try to find Indy's estranged father. He disappeared while he was looking for the Holy Grail. Indy is joined by Elsa Schneider. Indy's father named Henry is not there. They then discover that he is in a castle. They find him. Then Elsa and Donavan betray Henry and Indy. They are actually Nazis. The Nazis want the Grail and they tricked Henry and Indy into finding the Grail for them. They escape to Berlin, where they find Henry's diary full of information of where the Grail is. They then track Elsa and Donavan down. They are in Hatey with a map of where the Grail is. They find the place where the Grail is hidden. Donavan shoots Henry. Indy is forced to find the Grail with healing powers. He goes through three obstacles and retrieves the Grail. He heals Henry. Donavan dies. Then Elsa causes an earthquake. Elsa dies, the Grail is destroyed, but Henry and Indy bond for the first time ever.Overall, this is a fantastic movie. It really, truly is. I like the fact that this reveals that Indy's real name is Henry and Indiana is the name of their dog. This movie does not have the action of Raiders of the Lost Ark or Temple of Doom, but it is a great father-son story. There are some really good actions sequences, though. For example, in the beginning young Indy steals a Cross from another Indiana Jones guy and he is chased through a train and Indy gets all the things that he is famous for. The ability to use a whip, the scar on his cheek, and the phobia of snakes. There is also a good sequence with a boat chase in Venice. There is also a scene where Henry and Indy are chased by Nazis on a motorcycle. Anyway, this is a great movie that you should not miss if you are a fan of Steven Spielberg or Indiana Jones or action.10/10Recommended Films: Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom, Stars Wars.",

            "content": "\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" is a breathtaking deviation from the 2nd film in the serious, \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\". Doom was too formulaic, the action too over-the-top, too much gross stuff, etc. For the Last Crusade, Spielberg takes some risks and it really pays off.The interaction between Indy and his father was just what was needed to breathe new life into the characters. I did feel that bringing back Marcus didn't really serve any purpose... there is plenty of comedy in the film already. And there's really no romantic foil for Jones this time around, something I hope they will correct in the 4th film. Additionally, some of the realism of \"this might really happen\" is broken in the Last Crusade.All that aside, the action, adventure, music, camaraderie are all best-of-class. The scene with Der Furher did seem stuck on, however, and the Nazis do perhaps too much goosestepping and not enough being actually wiley adversaries (as the French archaeologist was in the first film).Who should see this film:-- action film buffs - a must-see!-- everyone else -- well, see Raiders of the Last Ark first-- arty types, wear a bag over your head and hope that nobody you know spots you enjoying this film. But see it anyway.I couldn't quite bring myself to give Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade a 10 out of 10, for a little bit too much campy. So 9 out of 10 was what I gave it.",

            "content": "The most challenging part of writing an Indiana Jones sequel is probably coming up with a Macguffin that can rival the Ark of the Covenant. Originally Lucas wanted to make this movie about a haunted house, but since Spielberg had already produced Poltergeist he had no interest in making another one. The only artifact they could think of was the holy grail, but they were concerned it would be too feeble, so Spielberg came up with the idea to make this movie about Indy and his father. This decision turned out to be the film's greatest strength, and elevated it above the Temple of Doom.The Last Crusade went in the direction of a character study. Sean Connery plays a stiff, strict, yet eccentric Henry Jones Sr., who has been estranged from his son for twenty years. He disapproves of just about everything his son does. While their relationship is written just like every other father/son relationship in a Spielberg movie, Connery and Ford have wonderful chemistry, and their scenes are funny and touching. Henry Jones Sr. is only rivaled by Marion Ravenwood for the title of best sidekick in my opinion. Nevertheless the strength of the father/son story really only demonstrates how weak the treasure hunt plot is. While it's better than the search for the Sankara stones, the grail story lacks the mystery and danger of the Ark. It is sort of in the background for a great deal of the film.Spielberg and Lucas wanted to make this movie the lightest in the series, since there was really no other direction they could go. The humor in this movie is probably one of the more divisive aspects of the film. Some might find it too distracting, but I found it very entertaining. The action scenes are very fun but they are also somewhat smaller than the previous movies, except for the final tank chase scene. I think that by the time you make a third movie in any series it becomes a little difficult to top yourself. The love story isn't as strong as Raiders, since Indy seems to fall for Elsa Schneider a little too easily. She was more interesting than Willie Scott though. Another more controversial aspect of Last Crusade was the return of the Nazis, since people don't like it when sequels are too similar to the original. I don't think this really hurt the film though. Walter Donovan is sort of a second rate Belloq but I would say the Nazi Colonel Vogel was more threatening than the Nazi commander in the first film.Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade also features a short introduction to a young Indiana Jones, who was played by the late River Phoenix. Unfortunately I think he died before the Young Indiana Jones T.V. series was made. John Rhys Davies returns as Sallah for a much smaller part, but it is still nice to see him. All in all, the Last Crusade is an enjoyable romp that was once a fine end to the series, but now that Indiana Jones 4 is coming out in a few months, we will see if it can retain its silver medal.",

More of an attempt at humor and silly action don't come off.  They also succumb to a \"famous guest stars\" syndrome, kicking things off with Phoenix and later adding Connery.  At least Ford's death avoidance was somewhat believable before.  Here, he and dad escape far too often, far too easily.  Unmanned speedboats faking out killers, unmanned motorcycles *happening* to crash into bad guys, conveniently.  Then there's the Three Stooges nonsense, such as Connery blasting apart the tail of he and Ford's plane, Connery charging at seagulls while pumping an umbrella, or the fighter plane that slides through a tunnel with a dumbstruck pilot staring at the two heroes.  And like Temple of Doom, bad blue screen strikes again, with phoney planes crashing and pilot's flying unconvincingly into the camera.  Plus the lack of a true heroine and another hecticly filmed ending, and I've been disappointed yet again.  Very, very, seldomly Boam manages a poingnant moment between father and son, but much more was needed. Along with the succumbing to a typical final few minutes of a lamebrained laugh and a ride into the sunset.  And something just doesn't seem right when one of the main characters has died and levity is attempted, creating a feeling of uneasyness.  80s nostalgia will bring me back for part 4, but I'll go into the theater hanging my head in advance.",

Oh, don't get me wrong, I'm totally for the ladies, but ya gotta admit, he's a good looking man. Indiana is charming and funny, cool under pressure, and makes you want to grab a bull whip and a fedora hat and go hunt for hidden treasures, it's just too bad there aren't any Nazis to shoot along the way, gosh darnit. Sean Connery is a hoot as his old man, Dr. Jones Sr., perfectly cast as the comic relief and one of many quirky characters to inhabit the Jones films. River Phoenix does good in a very light hearted opening sequence as young Indy. I guess for me the star of the movie is Spielberg, Spielberg, Spielberg! The man can do no wrong, and him and Lucas working together is like a fanboys dream come true!  I kinda hope we might see another, but the years go by and Ford is only getting older. 9/10 stars for this Indy. G'night!",

There wasn't a single character in the whole movie that expressed any appeal to me, including Indy.The film, being far too long and short of the usual humour found in the previous two films ends up being a mediocre adventure flick which manages to lose the magic of the Indiana Jones legacy.2/10",

            "content": "The Last Crusade takes the franchise back to the more familiar origins of Raiders. The film starts with Indiana Jones' first adventure, where River Phoenix takes on the role of Indiana Jones. Phoenix is an absolute pleasure to watch on screen, not only does he show some resemblance to Harrison Ford, but he even throws in some of his actions and facial expressions. He deserves the most credit for the action sequence that he undertakes on the circus train. The circus train revisits the franchise as B movie material and it does so with a twist. You learn how Jones develops a fear of snakes, how he uses a bull whip and how he develops a scar on his chin. It has to be one of the greatest scenes of the whole film.Ford delivers his usual business as Jones in terms of his acting and activity in terms of the action sequences. However, Sean Connery steals the show and he does so in a more subtle manner. Considering that he was one of the main influences for the Indiana Jones character, he did not just revisit his origins, but instead played completely the opposite as a academic, calm and reserved person. Nevertheless, he manages to top his son at whatever he did, including sleeping with the same woman, coincidentally escaping from the Nazis and bringing down a German mesherschmit by the means of seagulls. Alison Doody also Dr. Elsa Schneider deserves appraisal for her very convincing role as a female Nazi. Julian Glover is outstanding for his role as the main villain and both Jonathan Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliot return as Sallah and Marcus Brody return as more of a comic relief.The film continues to comprise many unforgettable scenes, including the tomb of Sir Richard, the boat chase in Venice, the rescue and escape of Henry Jones Sr. from the Nazis. There is also the Nazi blimp scene and the escape from the German mesherschmits, the reclaiming of the Grail diary from the Nazis, with a cameo of Hitler, the tank battle and the overall finding of the Grail.What is particularly touching is that it was not just a case of finding the Holy Grail, but it was instead a story of father and son finding one another. The film ends warmly, as the Jones Jr., Jones Sr., Sallah and Brody ride off into the sunset, which will be the last time we ever see this quartet together on screen together. It is this scene that will always be remembered for their completion of \"The Last Crusade\".",

            "content": "Those who say the Godfather II is the only really good sequel, need to take another close look at this movie. I honestly do not get why this movie is so overlooked. Raiders of the Lost Ark  is acclaimed by critics as one of the greatest of all time, and it was very popular, but I personally think that this movie goes a step beyond the original. It has a lot going for it. For one, let's go to the fascinating religion verse science concept that presents itself in here. In the original, the ark appears, and everything is restored back to normal. A consequence-free, direct line from Point A to Point B ending. This one the whole issue is building up inside. The stakes are raised until Indiana Jones himself is presented with the ultimate challenge: disreguard everything about archeology and make a leap of faith. Additionally, the father-son relationship is great. The chemistry between the two glamorous stars is amazing. How often does a hero got involved in some kind of father-son dynamic. The complexities of their relationship are displayed through the subtleties in their conversations. They make a great team too. Their interactions are comical and almost-TV like but there's also a lot of noticeable sediment and chemistry. The status relationship is very interesting. As a kid, who obeyed his father without question. I love how Indiana's father is clearly less qualified to fight off the Nazis and is really an obstacle to Indiana, yet the whole father-is-superior complex exists. Sean Connery's character is difenitiely multi-demensional. He's passionate, educated, smart, a little touristy, and has a little touch of that James Bond charisma. Harrison Ford is riveting as always as the likable Indiana Jones. As for the villans, we got the seductive-but-passionate Austrian Archeologist and the professor. Of course, don't forget the equally intriguing and quirky sidekicks which include the clumsy but smart Marcus Brody, and Sallah, who was in Raiders of the Lost Ark. If that isn't enough, how about the whole Nazi angle, and the good vs evil, that's very delicately played into the story. Who could make a better enemy than the Nazis? And I love the tracing Indy from birth to adulthood idea, where parallels are drawn between the Cross of Coronado, his smile, and his hat. The story is cleverly set in different settings, where we really have a sense of segments. It's like a story happens in Venice and a completely different story happens in Saudi Arabia or Austria. Every part of the story line is plausible and well-crafted. And lastly, thumbs up for the action. Not as good as the original movie, but still always clever, always dramatic, and always exciting. The action is clouded with miles of suspense, from the boat chasing scene, to the one with the tanks in the desert, to the scene where they outrun the Nazis in the forest. In short, this movie is incredible, packed with non-stop action, fun, and adventure.",

It is pure adventure, mixed with plenty of self-satirizing humor that evokes a certain sentimentality for fans of the series. I disagree with many who feel that this is the weakest effort put forth by Spielberg and Lucas, and instead, place it a close second to Raiders of the Lost Ark. Last Crusade combines a seamless blend of adventure, humor and romance, with an unrelenting pace of action that takes the audience on an unforgettable journey in search of the Holy Grail. The brilliant addition of Sean Connery as Indy's father, may be one of the best cast father/son duos of recent memory and Connery steals almost nearly every scene he is given. The film's cast of familiar faces including the late Denholm Elliot and John Rhy-Davies reprising earlier roles, gives the viewer the comfort of recognition that a sequel should deliver. As for the swashbuckling archaeologist, Harrison Ford gives his most confident portrayal of Indiana, and his performance here just re-emphasizes the fact that Ford truly embodies yet another one of the most memorable characters in movie history (Han Solo, anyone?). In fact, a fourth movie would assuredly revive Ford's fizzling career, and introduce a \"real\" movie hero to a generation of new viewers. This one is a must-see for anyone who hasn't already, and a chance for those who have to remember how timeless this movie truly is.",

And the movie is not in the imdb top 250.\nAs a result, films that make American propaganda and show America as the world's savior are always highly rated. This shows the weakness of objectivity.A movie is not made so unreasonable to make fun of the Germans (Hitler). Okay, searching for logic in the adventure movie doesn't make much sense. But the destruction of a German tank by a horse-only man alone is a crap. Moreover, in the Fury movie, it was technically absurd for three American tanks to destroy even a German Tiger tank. In this movie, it is beyond nonsense.If we look at the film in terms of adventure, it is an immersive, intriguing a movie.Hilal canyon in Turkey (Hatay). But the Bowl is in Jordan (Petra).

He was just amazing, you can tell he studied Harrison Ford as he has all of Ford's mannerisms and it is almost like you are looking in the mirror at the younger Indy. It is a shame that he died because he would have made a very good successor to the role of Indiana Jones.The other reason is introducing the Father/son relationship which was really well written and acted. The chemistry works really well between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery. There are some very funny moments between them and it adds another layer to the story especially when there is confusion about which Dr Jones the evil guys are talking about.What is interesting about the start of the film is it shows the audience how Indy got his scar, where the influence came to dress the way he does and where his fear of snakes come from. We also find out why he is called Indiana which is funny when it turns out he named himself after the family dog.I like the fact that Elsa (Alison Doody) is working for the Nazis in this one because in the others Indy went off into the sunset with his heroine but she is working for the bad guys so she has to be punished for choosing the wrong side and does when she falls to her death and instead of riding off with his heroine, he rides off with his father and friends.The magic is still there and again the stunts just make the film what it is, an entertaining romp that never slows its pace and keeps the audience interested with its amazing stunts.It works on all levels and there was no part of it that I didn't like. It is just the best.It was nice seeing more of Marcus Brody (Denholm Eliott) in a different way, he is slow at getting out of danger and just walks into the enemies hands. The audience is also told he got lost in his own museum once which we didn't see any indication of in the first film, he came across as very knowledgeable and competent man.",

The film was the second highest grossing picture of the year, trailing only Batman and finishing ahead of a number of other high-profile sequels, including Back to the Future II, Lethal Weapon 2, and Star Trek V. The mixture of action, comedy, and romance provided in Raiders of the Lost Ark has been imitated many times over the years, but never matched. Of all the pretenders, The Last Crusade is among the few to have come close, and a lot of that has to do with the movie's three invaluable assets: star Harrison Ford, co-star Sean Connery, and director Steven Spielberg.

These two actors work beautifully together as they fight off the Nazis in search for the Holy Grail. Two actors from \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" reprise their roles to great effect in \"Last Crusade\": Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody and John Rhys-Davies as Sallah. Alison Doody is the heroine (good or bad?); Julian Glover is the villain; River Phoenix portrays a young Indy at the beginning to see how this character really got his start. \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" not only has great characters, it also has a decent story (taking place in 1938), plus exciting action scenes and special effects. It's better than the second film \"Temple of Doom\" and comes very close to topping the first film \"Raiders\". The \"Indiana Jones\" series should stay right where it is with the \"Last Crusade\" as the finale.

This movie featured the same type of humor we have become accustomed to from Jones, as well as another beautiful woman (also probably the best Indy girl) and lots of great action scenes! This movie starts off with a teenage Indy (River Phoenix) which gives us a look at an event that molds his life and character as well as his relationship with his father, Henry (Sean Connery). We also learn he is a \"Junior\" and that he hates to be called that.Back as an adult, Indy's father is kidnapped and he must set out to find him. His only clues are his father's diary notes, which were mysteriously sent to him earlier that day. They lead him to Italy, where he meets the gorgeous blonde, Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), who becomes an integral part of this story.Once again, the grown up Indy (Harrison Ford) does battle with the Nazis. Apparently, Adolf Hitler is after the Holy Grail, which contains the blood of Christ. So Indiana and his father team up to get there first. Along the way, there is a great action scene where Jones fights a few Nazis on board a moving tank.Overall, as I mentioned earlier, I believe this to be the best Indiana Jones movie of the three. This action movie was good long before movie studios learned to make the great CGI and special effects. It's effects were pretty good anyways but back in 1989, things just did not look as good as they can make them today. Still, highly recommended and worth your time. 9.5/10",

            "content": "Despite the many rumours of a fourth movie, \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" remains the conclusion to the Indiana Jones series.  After complaints about the violence in the last film, as well as the abundance of racial stereotypes, both elements have been toned down for \"Last Crusade\". In fact there is a considerably more human and spiritual emphasis in \"Last Crusade\" than in its predecessors.  This is a story of betrayal, religious faith and the mending of a broken relationship between father and son.After an opening prologue which sees a young Indiana Jones (the late River Phoenix) steal an important artefact from the hands of looters, and acquire his fedora and skill with the whip in the process, the action moves forward to 1939, where Jones (Harrison Ford) is asked by antique collector Donovan (Julian Glover) to find his father Henry Jones(Sean Connery), who went missing helping Donovan find the Holy Grail.On rescuing his father, Jones learns that Donovan is really a Nazi turncoat. Making a daring escape, Jones with the help of his father, museum curator Brody (Denholm Elliot) and his old friend Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) races to find the Grail before Donovan and the Nazis get their hands on it...The story by George Lucas and Menno Meyjes lifts its plot virtually straight from \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", with Indy racing against faceless German soldiers to retrieve a precious artefact with mystical powers.  In large part because of this, \"Last Crusade\" does not possess the freshness or ingenuity of \"Raiders\" and the story itself has one or two flaws of its own. The elaborate deception the Nazis use to lure Jones into the Grail hunt never really holds water and too often it is never explained how Jones, stuck in the middle of nowhere after a chase or fight, manages to get himself to wherever he's meant to be for the next scene.However, there is a great deal more humanity than the two predecessors and it is from this element that the movie benefits.  The hunt for the Grail is used as a test of both faith and intellectual ingenuity.  This is especially true with in the film's finale, which sees Jones relying on both these traits to survive and win through.  Very intentionally, there is a lack of sexual chemistry here which is substituted by the relationship between Indy and his father.  The quest for the Grail, which so obsessed Henry Jones he cut himself off from his son thus splitting them apart, is what brings them together as the quest nears its end.  As the film progresses, they repair their broken relationship in a convincing and touching manner.This is helped by some splendid acting from Ford and Connery, who bring the relationship to life.  Ford has settled in now as a more mature but still adventurous Indiana Jones, and Connery brings some feisty humour into the role of his bookish dad.  They are well supported by Julian Glover and Michael Byrne (playing head Nazi Vogel) as the chief villains, along with Alison Doody as an attractive researcher who isn't all she appears to be. John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliot both return from \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" and their increased screen-time here is welcome.There is plenty of action in Last Crusade, all of it accentuated by the themes and music of the brilliant John Williams.  The best sequences include a fight aboard a boat in the middle of a stormy ocean, and a great horse/tank sequence in the desert.Even if they do not make a fourth film, we still have this: an imperfect but still very fitting end to an enjoyable action/adventure series.",

The boat chase is well staged, the hunt for Sir Richard's tomb is well crafted, and the rats are fun. But by far some of the greatest stuff in the film are the action scenes. From the opening chase to the race to the exit from the earthquake at the end, the film's action scenes are some of the best I've seen in a late 80's film.

Professor 'Indiana' Jones (Harrison Ford) is back fighting Nazi's.After Indy's father, Henry(Sean Connery) goes missing in Europe looking for the Holy Grail, he is sent to Italy by Walter Donovan (Julian Glover) to help find his father. With him he brings Dr. Marcus Brody (Delholm Elliot) and the clue to the Grail, a dairy left for behind. After finding where the grail trail begins and finds his father, it is a race between the Nazi's and the Joneses to find the Cup of the King of Kings.The film brings back the good old days of film making without the kind of films such as Gigli (2003) and Grind (2003). Harrison Ford finishes off his second classic trilogy (the other being Star Wars) and does it so superbly. Connery is hilarious as the off-beat father. The story of finding the Holy Grail is just as good as the story to find the Ark of the Covenant. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Starring: Harrison Ford, Sean Connery, Delholm Elliot, John Rhyes-Davies,Alison Doody, and Julian Glover.4 1/2 out of 5 Stars.",

That is neither a bad thing nor a particularly great thing, but Sean Connery really makes most of this movie, because it's kind of fun to see a much older version of James Bond arguing with Han Solo about whether to pursue the Nazis to Berlin or Venice.Not the perfect movie, but great in this particular series.",

We also have Nazis again in order to see these bastards get what they deserve, street justice!The plot is a bit similar to the first movie ,Indi is task by a business man to find the Holy Grail and prevent the Third Reich from acquiring it and use it to conquer the world, what did you expect these are the same people who wanted to create a master race of humans! During this quest Jones meet and teams up with his father Herny Jones Senior ( the real name of Indi is Herny Jones Junior) and the make a good duo.The action is always to a Indiana film great with awesome stunts , gripping fighting scene and some slapstick humour here and here to light up the atmosphere in order to the audience time to relax for to much drama it is a thing and can make a viewer bored. What I also like to Indiana Jones films and we get the in the Last Crudaser, is that much of the sets are historical places and you always get a bit of the history of the place ,just a bit to make you go look for it! I for real think that this was done on purpose in order to learn the viewer some history ,thank Steve ,you are great!In conclusion if the Indiana Jones film had stopped i=to the last Crusade the we would have one of the most awesome trilogies in cinema history, but then 2008 came ,I have nothing to write now for this flick ,but its time will come. For the Last Crsade just go watch NOW!",

He is joined by Marcus Broody ( Denholm Elliot) and John Rhy Davis. In Venice they meet Elsa the seductive Blonde who meets her maker at the end of the story. They Fight Nazis and have the time of their lives. My only complaint is when they are in the grail temple that Elsa's death spoils the whole film. The scenario is that the grail lies past 3 challenges and to get it Indiana Jones must have faith in himself. He is forced to get the grail after Henry is shot. When he does and Henry is healed it seems everything has turned out all right until Elsa tries to leg it with the grail. It is not meant to be and Elsa is left hanging over a hole in the ground with her free hand on Indy, However she seems more concerned with reaching the grail which is close but she cannot quite reach,Suddenley she slips and falls screaming to her death into the mist at the bottom of the hole wherever that is. Which leaves viewers pondering over the question what is down there? will she ever be found again?. Where does her body fall?. Anyway as soon as Elsa has done her death scene it is nearly repeated with Indy trying to reach the grail he cant and is forced to give up with his father holding on to him. And the film ends with Indy Sallah Marcus and Henry galloping off into the sunset. Which is a bit strange because a main character has just died. Anyway apart from the ending its a great film. Elsa was also a Nazi. 100/100",

The sets are astonishing, the music is incredible, and the addition of Sean Connery as Henry Jones Sr. is genius, as he and Harrison Ford manage to give birth to Spielberg's finest comedy ever. The theme here is the Holy Grail, a fantastic follow-up to the ark antics of years earlier. The bad guys are the nazis again, but this time the enemy is more subtle and treacherous. As a character says, \"don't trust anyone\". And the quest for the grail allows us to embark on the ride of our lives, as we are taken in boat, plane, car, bike and train chases, as we see the incredible action (the initial sequence of young indy is my favorite) and as I even get to see Indy fighting in a boat off the shore of my country (complete with boxes written in portuguese)! I love this movie, it has good taste, good humor, great music, great cinematography and spills Spielberg's talent through every aspect of it. A triumph, to which I would have given an 11. P.S.: Harrison Ford was 47 years old when he shot this movie. He is now almost 60. Lucas is too busy with Star Wars and will touch the Indy adventures just after Episode III (2005). By that time, Indy will be 63 years old. What shall we expect? I hope there's one more to come, I know they won't disappoint us.",

He was very funny, and I liked how he always called Indiana Jones Junior! Because of this, I was pretty sad when he got shot.

But this time around Sean Connery is thrown into the mix as Indy's bumbling father and along with Marcus Brodey  they are on a quest to find the Holy Grail. George Lucas also returns with a great script  and Steven Spielberg is again behind the camera working his movie magic. Spielberg uses many unique camera angles to help set the mood and generate suspense. A prime example of this is the scene in which Indy and his father have been tied up by the Nazis. The camera starts on a far off shot and slowly pulls in on Ford's face as he makes his speech on Marcus Brodey, along with the slowly rising music which gives this scene an uplifting feeling. A quick cut is then used so that the audience can see that Brodey is not all he is cracked up to be. The editing is also very believable. In the place scene we edit from plane to plane. Film makers often use this technique to make it appear as if there are more than one plane even though only one is used during filming. There is also an effective scene where the camera goes from the tail of the good plane to the cockpit of the bad plane. There are many methods of creating atmosphere in the film. The music is always dark and depressing when the bad guys are around. Also when the bad guys are making their plans you will notice that it is dark and raining outside. There are also many comedic overtones in the film to create a family oriented atmosphere. Music is key in suspense. When Indy crashes through the window into a dark room the music builds up slowly to create tension. By the time Dr. Jones talks the audience is so sure something bad will happen that they jump at the sudden sound of a voice or loud noise. The music then stops when we find out that it is his father. Between the big name cast, a strong script by George Lucas and great direction bye acclaimed director Steven Spielberg, this is one entertaining thrill ride at its best. I am looking forward to seeing the direction the series will take when the cast and crew return for a fourth Indiana Jones outing in 2005.",

Unlike Karen and Willie in the previous two films, Elsa is a mysterious woman and you cannot tell she should be trusted. Some clues that Indy found with her lead him to reunion with his father, who has been captured by Nazis for his knowledge of the Grail.The middle part of the film is like a buddy road trip movie of the father and the son, and is the best part of the film I think. I love Dr. Henry Jones played by Sean Connery. He is a respectable scholar, but when it comes to fighting enemies, he is quite incapable. Going through troubles along with Indy, Henry's well-intentioned actions always turn out to put them in a more dangerous situation. It's hilarious.And the reconciliation of the two is subtle and touching. When Indy was young, Henry was always obsessed with his work and neglected him. Indy has been feeling lonely but Henry has no regret. Despite this conflict, the two still somewhat resemble to each other, and they certainly love each other.Action scenes are exciting as usual in the franchise, including ancient booby traps, shoot-outs, and car chases. But I think this time it is more story-oriented. In addition to the father-son relationship, the pursuit for the Grail itself is also very interesting, which involves tragidy of people who are obsessed with the Grail.",

With the one two punch of Harrison Ford and Sean Connery, it is pretty darn difficult to come up with a bad final product. When you add Steven Spielberg as the director and George Lucas as producer and one of the writers, all the elements are there for a spectacular film experience. Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade does not disappoint on any level. Other than the fact that this has long been reputed to be the last film in the series. One can not be just a little sad that this much talent may never collaborate again to make another one of these films that really represent why people love going to the movies.This time out, Indiana's (Ford) father, Henry Jones (Connery) is working for a wealthy collector who is financing his life long quest for the Holy Grail. The Nazis, who are also interested in the Grail, are in competition with Jones. (I guess they are still ticked off over that whole Lost Ark thing.) Anyway, Jones goes missing. So son Indiana travels to his fathers last known location, Venice, to try to find out what happened to his father and also see if he can't complete his father's search for the Grail. He travels with longtime friend, Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliot), and the hook up with the elder Jones' assistant, Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody). Together the three search Venice for clues to the location of the Grail. Jones eventually finds his father who joins the group on the quest for the Grail. As usual, Indiana's adventures are never dull, and this time he has to deal with Nazis, rats and a high speed boat chase on the way to his goal of the Grail.Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade is very well written and lives up to the first two films. No disappointments here. The film opens with a flashback sequence with Indiana as a boy and explains many of the reasons that Indiana is the man he is. Last Crusade is frequently funny which is a tribute as much to the interaction of the leads as it is to the sharp writing. Harrison Ford and Sean Connery are perfectly cast as the father and son who don't always see eye to eye. Throw in the supporting cast of Denholm Elliot and John Rhys-Davies (Sallah), both returning to their roles from Raiders Of The Lost Ark and there are more than a few light moments intertwined with the seemingly nonstop action.Like the previous films, Steven Spielberg gives us a film filled with elaborate stunts and the sort of settings that can only be found in an Indiana Jones movie. There is virtually nothing wrong with this movie from a technical standpoint. Last Crusade has stood up well in the 12 years since it first hit the big screen. It is easily one of the finest action/adventure films ever made. This film also compares very well to the first one, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, which in my opinion, is quite possibly the best film ever made.9/10",

It had boring characters, a boring plot, cheap effects, and stupid lines. This could be even better a movie than \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", which would make THIS the best adventure film of all time. There are so many reasons why this is such a great ending to such a great film series. It tells you more about Indy's background in a wonderful opening where we see him as a kid. The scenes in Venice are greatly entertaining and look a lot like they come from a Bond flick. It has a great scene where Indy accidentally runs into Hitler himself, and he signs him an autograph! That scene is funnier and more clever than anything else in the series. There are many other funny and exciting scenes in the film, but the part that really stands out is the ending: it's very powerful, it's exciting, it's awe-ispiring, and it's emotional unlike any other scene in the Indy films.

Harrison Ford & Sean Connery are great actors with tons of charisma, but the story is rather weak and shallow.  The production values are very good, as you would expect with Spielberg behind the camera, but it's just a Hollywood adventure story. Give me Michelle Yeoh in Magnificent Warriors instead any time.The frivolity of the film is summed up in the amazingly anticlimactic ending.  **SPOILER** Can you imagine how p*ssed off you'd be if you'd been guarding some holy artefact for 700 years, and the first American that comes along loses it after 5 minutes :p  **END SPOILER**",

It kicks off with a great action sequence (Phoenix is spot on as a young Indy),which is followed by another great action sequence in Venice. But for me the film really becomes one of my all time favorite action-adventure films once we meet Jones Sr. The chemistry between Ford and Connery is golden. I have seen the film countless times but it manages to bring a smile on my face every single time. The action is superb, but it is the performance of these great legends (a droll one-liner here, a smirky smile there) that makes those scene timeless.",

Next \"Kingdom of the crystal skull\" which i am very excited to see. All must see the greatest adventure movies of all time!After the toned down \"Temple of Doom\". Indiana Jones comes roaring back for another adventure. This time Jones teams up with his father, Henry Jones senior played by Sean Connery. Unfortunately they still can't measure up to \"The Raiders of the Lost Ark\".There were great chase scenes and some scenes that have you laughing. This time Indiana is on an adventure to find the holy grail and battle a big villain. Hitler and Nazi's. Indiana can still find the time to give us a great adventure.Again, they still can't get a girl that can measure up to Marion Ravenwood. Maybe they are doing it on purpose. That girl is Dr Elsa Schneider played by Alison Doody. Indiana Jones was great as always. Jones father Henry Jones had his moments that will make you laugh. He is also an archaeologist.Now to the actors. Harrison Ford stills owns that role and was excellent in this. Sean Connery was great and i can't think of anyone else to play Indiana's dad. Alison Doody was OK.I totally recommend this. Only if you have seen the first two.9/10",

Last Crusade really tackles no new ground that the first two Indy pics didn't cover- aside from the whole Indy's father thing. Even Temple of Doom is better. Doom is a more original film because it tries new things and helped bring about the PG-13 rating. It's also more true to the Indy films inspiration- adventure movies of the 30's and 40's- like Gunga Din. Crusade feels more like a very well done reunion pic. If you seek entertainment and a very solid closing to the trilogy, then Last Crusade fits the bill. Just don't proclaim it one of Spielberg's best. It ain't even close.",

But it is both Connery and Ford that carry the over the top excitement and in-deniable funniness that makes the film both memorable and funny on both levels. Speilburg is considered one of the greatest directors ever lived, and he vividly proves so in this film alone that he can direct majestically. Harrison Ford has never been better as in a Indiana Jones film, and he certainly doesn't look any different from the fist one. By all means, Indiana Jones is back and better than ever, delivering the hype and brilliance of one of the greatest cinema characters of all time.",

            "content": "The third of the Indiana Jones films is a terrific action adventure. However,it is the least interesting of the three. Spielberg and Lucas obviously took to heart criticisms of Temple Of Doom,and decided to return to the format of Raiders. In fact,more than that,it's basically a remake.Once again there is a search for a holy artifact,once again there are evil Nazis also after it,once again the climax is not an action scene {well,there is an unimpressive earthquake} but an act of the supernatural,Indy has two of the same allies,etc,etc,etc. All this makes the film a little tired. You know where the story is going to go,and so the freshness of the first two films is missing.Still,it's a terrific fun romp,and there are several compensations. The most notable is of course Sean Connery as Indy's Dad,with his relationship with Indy being both touching and funny. The film as a whole probably contains more laughs then the others,and even more action,some of which,such as a boat chase in Venice,have more than a touch of Bond about them. The highlights here are a thrilling tank chase which almost outdoes the truck chase of Raiders,a motorcycle chase and a plane chase which has a great and amusing payoff. One cannot of course fail to mention the opening setpiece with River Phoenix as a young Indy which shows how he obtained things such as his whip,scar and fear of snakes. The sequence set amidst the caverns and lethal traps near where the Grail is also works very well and is extremely successful. However the religious elements somewhat fall flat and it's a pity the end is just a rehash of that of She.Alison Doody is an interesting love {or rather lust}interest and Harrison Ford is again excellent as Indy although he has lost some of the edge to his previous performances in the role. The film somewhat lacks a strong villain. All in all,still great entertainment despite it's flaws.",

In the tank scene Indy has his bag strap caught around the barrel of the gun and is unable to release it. But after escaping from being crushed by a rock, his bag strap suddenly no longer restricts his movement. In the invisible bridge scene he crosses the bridge on faith alone and then scatters dirt to reveal the bridge. He could have used dirt to reveal the bridge in the first place. In another escape scene Indy drives away with his father on a motorbike with side car. But he doesn't wait for the Germans in the boat to motor off the shore. There are only two sections of the story that involve the Holy Grail. The rest of the story is once again about Nazi Germany. In general, the story relies too much upon comedy to see it through.Characters: Predominantly male dominated. The only female is a young woman who sleeps around without contraception and yet miraculously fails to get pregnant. Is she a Nazi, isn't she a Nazi? Even she doesn't know. The 700 year old crusader knight was particularly unconvincing and looked like he was in the wrong movie. Perhaps he thought he was in Monty Python's The Holy Grail. Connery's character struggles to portray Indy's father. Acting: Harrison Ford's facial expressions are well rehearsed by now and used in every scene. Connery normally relies upon his deep smooth voice but it sounds weak in this movie.Scenery And Props: The tank was very odd. A WW1 British tank with a turret being employed by the Germans. Even odder was it's speed of 20mph. Most WW1 British tanks could barely manage 5mph. The final location of Petra in Jordan now looks unconvincing considering we know it has no affiliation with Christianity.Conclusion: A hash of old ideas and a bit of a disappointment. Once again relied heavily upon the Germans as an opponent where the opportunity was there to introduce new adversaries such as the Knights Templar or another religious sect.Best Scene: The No Ticket scene on the zeppelin.",

Most people probably consider \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" to be more of a classic than this film, but \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" proved to be the most enjoyable, in my opinion. This film has just as much potential of being a classic as the original. Consider the famous shot of Indy's hat being placed on his head for the first time. The flashback shots to Indiana Jones as a kid are masterfully done. Sean Connery, as Indiana Jones' dad, is a perfect addition to the film and, as usual, manages to steal every scene he is in (my favorite being \"I should've mailed it to the Marx Brothers.\"). Following Indy through the path to the Holy Grail toward the end of the film is likely the best scene, with excellent camera-work and unpredictable scenarios he finds himself in. The scene in which Indy and his father must move from a blimp to a plane to a car in just minutes is a perfect example of how much fun this film can be to watch. Some of the fighting scenes can drag on a little, however, which tends to be a problem with all of the Indiana Jones movies. Nevetheless, this one is still the best and leaves me with very little room to complain.***1/2 out of ****",

            "content": "These days I tried to re-watch the first Indy trilogy, and found the first one--Raiders of the Lost Ark most technically advancing even though it's made in 1981. It had won multiple Oscars and was even nominated for the Best Picture, showing how much impact it had on the whole industry or even the whole world. Among the 3 movies, Indianna Jones and the Last Crusades is unfortunately, the most dated.The fact it is dated is not hard to see. Look at the CGIs and you will notice they are so obvious that, even Temple of Doom was a better case of effects-driven movie. ROLA pretty much invented this genre, and brought the CG into a new decade; TOD advanced the actions especially the tunnel roller-coaster scenes; Last Crusade had also got so many memorable action scenes relying mostly on stunt-men and CGI, but the former is always covering the latter. Anyway, the final result is not optimal.However, Last Crusade is still the best among its brothers. Its recognition as a plot/characters-driven story is so often ignored based on the fact that it's an Indy movie. The chemistry between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery is priceless in every scene, especially when they interact with the female Nazi. For audiences above 30, it's even better to see their dysfunctional relationship being fixed during the search of the holy grail. Even they delete most of the action sequences, the movie would still be a very good dramedy about father-son relationship.Beyond all these values, Last Crusade inherited the New Age blood from the creators that main characters are portrayed as Renaisance Men who dwelled in reason and science. This was more obvious in the first two movies, but like a miracle, Last Crusade introduced Henry Jones into the franchise, who brought back the voice of the old-school believers. Many disputes between him and Indy were initiated upon their different beliefs. But with the experience of Holy Grail, they were able to accept each other, and delivered an important message that faith in the divine power would live longer than immortality. No wonder I heard a lot western audiences see it as a \"holy\" movie. Anyway, Last Crusade will impress with some core values of Christiannity, yet it's not a gospel movie.In short, Last Crusade is a minor disappointment in technology, but a superb character story and help delivered a good message. It will last longer than all the others in its genre.",

            "content": "The third movie in a movie franchise is a difficult one to make. People who enjoyed the first 2 movies have aspects of the films they love and want to see again, but there is a risk of being repetitive. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade does feature elements of the previous movies that fans would enjoy (Nazis, chase sequences, religious relics, snakes) and brand new elements that appeals to everyone. Brand new to the saga in this movie is Sean Connery's role as Indiana's father, Dr. Henry Jones. An aloof father, consumed by finding the Holy Grail, Connery plays the detached father very well, opening up to Indy only after he thinks he's dead; no one is surprised that Indiana was raised by such a role model. The elder Jones has gone missing, leaving the younger in quest to find him. This adventure leads Indiana on the path to find the Holy Grail as well, trying to retrace his father's steps. This first takes Indiana and Denholm Elliot's Dr. Marcus Brody to Venice, where they meet Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody). A trip through the catacombs of a Venice church and a Bonds-esquire boat chase through the city's canals reveals the truth of Dr. Henry Jones' location, setting into motion a trip through Italy, Austria, Germany, and finally finishing somewhere in the Holy Lands. The Nazis are featured again as the villains, with the full power of the Third Reich chasing down the Jones family. Sallah returns, first trying to protect the inept Brody (perfectly set up by an Indiana speech), then as Indiana's traveling companion who likes to collect camels. This is the funniest of the Indiana Jones movies, with several sly, dry moments of wit, most at the expense of poor Dr. Brody. This movie features planes, zeppelins, cars, tanks, motorcycles, boats, and trains, all of which are the backdrop to this adventure film. On equal footing as the original Raider of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is a worthy adventure to (momentary at least) finish off the franchise.",

Was Temple of Doom too dark? Too quirky? Too gross and violent? Or is it just best to keep Nazis around as villains (I'm looking at you, Crystal Skull)?The \"origin\" scene with young Indy in 1912 is a fun and fast way to give us insight into his childhood and passion for putting stuff into museums, even if it means punching, whipping, and shooting along the way. We get intrigue, rat spelunking, boat races, motorcycle chases, zeppelins, dogfights, an unbelievable moment with Hitler, and the ultimate conclusion that you shouldn't mess where you shouldn't be a-messin'.The final scene begs several questions about what exactly are the boundaries of the holy grail's powers, and if the purpose of protecting the grail was to keep it from bad people, why not throw it down the deep chasm on day one?But life isn't about the journey, man.

First of all there was the casting of former Bond actor Sean Connery as Indy's father(actually Julian Glover was also associated with Bond, he came in For Your Eyes Only). The Last Crusade is pretty much one great stunt after another but it is so breathtaking you can't help but be completely awestruck by it. There is even a decent enough plot, which nowadays gets forgotten in fun summer flicks of today. It's opening sequence is probably the best out of the entire franchise. It is even laced with some humour. The Last Crusade was released in 89, the year of the big movies, Ghostbusters 2,Batman,Honey I shrunk the kids but The Last Crusade held its own and was a huge success. Then in 2008 my worst nightmare was confirmed, the release of Kingdom of the lost skulls which had none of the brilliance of the original If only Mr Spielberg had left it at three and had not made Kingdom,which added nothing to the franchise other than to make a few thousand more dollars for Mr Spielberg.",

This relationship isn't explored as deeply as you would see in a drama, and that's okay because this is after all an action movie.

Of course, the nazi's are also in on it and pester Dr. Jones' every move!The comic interplay between Indy and his father provides some of the most memorable moments on screen which relieves the tension of the intense and exciting action sequences.A true classic - Brilliant! 10/10",

On any given day, this could be my favorite of the series, as with the other two.We had Indy reacquainting himself with a long lost love in the first film, we had his paternal side showcased in Doom, now the story comes back around to his own father-son relationship. The father/son relationship angle was the next logical step in the Indy series and it is brought to life with perfection through another fantastic performance by Ford and a career highlight performance from Sean Connery. There was absolutely no one else who could have been Dr Henry Jones Sr. Ford and Connery are a joy to watch.Davies and Denholm are brought back to reprise their roles as Sala and Brody, respectively, and with the addition of a gorgeous Alison Doody, this film helped to make the Indy trilogy one of the strongest, and in my opinion, best, series of films ever to be done in the modern trilogy format.Everyone was once again on their A-game and it is a joy to watch this film even though almost 20 years has past.",

The same is true of the previous 2 installments of this trilogy, we don't talk about the 4th Indiana Jones. The editing in the film is spot on along with the use of the camera to signal the end of a scene and the movie to the next. As is the tradition in all of the films in the trilogy during times of travel a map is used and the stops highlighted with the flight path and the change of direction. This serves well to set the tone that the film will take place in some far way place. I believe that the Indiana Jones trilogy served well to be recreated in the new century as \"National Treasure\". The plot and the character development is the same, right down to the dad who's just not as quick as the main character.\nOverall, the film was good. It's a predicable story that is a good blend of fact and fiction. It's the best kind of story, one that blends the fiction elements with the fact and makes it hard to tell the difference.",

            "review_title": "Boring, trite, lacklustre and too much toned down, just a rehash of \"Raiders\", pleading forgiveness for the masterpiece \"Doom\".",
            "content": "I still don't understand why this movie became the fans' favorite, when the vastly superior \"Doom\" is constantly bashed. I was lucky enough to watch the original three in the cinema and i've watched them by the correct chronological order: my first was \"Doom\", then a rerun of \"Raiders\" and 5 years later as a teen, enthusiastically attended the release of \"Crusade\", but it ended with me lefting the movie theater in a total state of disappointment. Where do i start ?Firstly, it lacks the sense of action and adventure, the sarcasm, the edgy and the goosebumping thrills from the previous two installments. When we think or talk about the most memorable scenes from this franchise, \"Raiders\" have the most iconic and unforgettable opening in the South American jungle, like if a comic book came alive; the sequence in Nepal when Indy and Marion reunite; the swordsman in Cairo; the Well of Souls; the truck chase and so on. \"Doom\" have a glamourish opening which reminds the classical musicals from the Hollywood golden age, mixed with the exotic war dramas from the 30's & 40's and the early James Bond films, plus the plane crash; the spike chamber; the black sleep of Kali Ma; Mola Ram (which was one of the most sinister villains ever put on film); the mine chase and the rope bridge.\n\"Crusade\" have a lacklustre opening sequence, where Indy, at the young age of 13 and in the total of 10 minutes screen time, acquires all his future trademarks: \"It belongs to a Museum\"; the ophidiophobia; the chin scar; the mastering of the whip and even his Fedora hat given away by a man who was supposed to be Abner Ravenwood, the future Indy's mentor, but he was ended up credited in the cast list as \"Fedora Guy\", because Lucas at the last moment, opted to exclude the Abner connection. One of his first dumb moves.\nTo the rest of the film, the two beards gave us a tepid boat chase; the rescue on the Castle Brunwald; the zeppelin; the tank chase in the desert, which was an unimaginative rehash of \"Raiders\", and the anti-climatic, to not saying boring, finale.Secondly, the MacGuffin in this one wasn't as exciting as the Ark of Covenant or the Sankara Stones, and once again it's a Jewish / Catholic artifact that resembles too much the Ark and even have the greedy Nazis as the evil nemesis, searching for the power of the Grail to make an invencible army. Not wanted to repeat myself, but once again, the germans are collaborating with a foreigner scholar, not Belloq who died 2 years before during the events of the Ark, but Donovan.Thirdly, the characters, Ford has been saying that this one is his favorite Indy, but what he said doesn't mean that it rings true, because he looks bored and uninterested for almost the entire movie and his acting feels more like a mix of spoofing Indy and playing Harrison Ford, than the Indiana Jones we all loved. His lack of conviction is apparent here, he grew tired of the character after the difficult shoot of \"Doom\" and around this time, he was establishing himself in more serious roles in drama films. Connery was a case of mere stunt casting, not because he was the best actor to play Indy's dad, but the two beards wanted the former James Bond in it, and Sean was fresh from his Oscar winning role in the B.O. Hit, \"The Untouchables\" and became a trend again after almost a decade into oblivion.\nConnery's roles in the acclaimed, \"The Name of the Rose\" and the sleeper hit, \"Highlander\", in which he played the witty old mentor to younger heroes, convinced Spielberg & Lucas that he could do the same for Ford and cash-in on Connery's crescent popularity. The executives at Paramount, applauded.Poor old Connery delivers an inspired performance with lots of heart and integrity, which earned him the SAG and BAFTA nominations, and no question about that, but he wasn't the best pick to play Henry Jones, Sr. Charlton Heston should have been cast. Not only he resembled much more Ford in the looks, acting style and 'screen persona', but also Heston's jungle adventure movies from the 50's, such as \"The Naked Jungle\" or \"Secret of the Incas\", were the obvious inspirations to Indiana Jones. Even more than James Bond.The late great Denholm Elliott, returns as Marcus Brody, this time more than a glorified cameo, he's also into the adventure of tracking the Grail, except that in \"Raiders\", Spielberg & Lucas established the character as an adventurer and an archaeologist like Indy in his younger days, but he only serves here the purpose of the buffoon, the comic relief, a distracted erudit that \"gets lost in his own Museum\" and sometimes looks and acts as if he's suffering from Alzheimer.John Rhys-Davies also returns in this installment, but his character Sallah have as much importance to the plot as his brother-in-law's camels. A total waste of two great actors and two beloved characters from \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\".Julian Glover and Alison Doody are too weak villains, they look like Disney Channel next to Arnold Toht or Mola Ram.\nSexy and doll faced, Doody is certainly the nicest Indy Girl to look at, a delicious eye pleaser, but the worst in the acting department, and Glover is not a fill-in for Belloq's sophisticated and flamboyant eeriness, not even by a mile.\nMichael Byrne as Colonel Ernst Vogel is the only menacing villain, but he's just supporting, at least they should have made his character more prominentLast, River Phoenix, sporting a late 80's haircut style, played Indy at age 13 in 1912, a bit 'off', but we can accept that as Indy is well-known for being a misfit. The late actor gave an acceptable performance as young Indy, after he played Ford's son in the underrated, \"The Mosquito Coast\", where he studied his mannerisms and dialogue delivery.\"Crusade\" was scripted and made like this for both beards 'play it safe', after the bad reviews over \"Doom\", they opted to dumb down \"Raiders\" and offer \"Crusade\" as a lacklustre crowd-pleaser, that is more a comedy than an adventure film. They atoned the dark, cynical and sarcastic aspects from the first two, in exchange to the politically correct and lighthearted afternoon flick in which Harrison Ford and Sean Conney sometimes it looks like they're playing Abbott and Costello in search for the Grail.It still have incredible production values: the filming locations such as Venice; great cinematography by Douglas Slocombe; the master musical score from John Williams (even if it was the weakest from the original trilogy); the stunning art & costume design and some impressive stunt work, but it painfully lacks in everything else from the acting to the tone, the trite directing and the unimaginative script.Neither Ford's heart, Lucas or Spielberg, were within the making of \"Crusade\", and the magic started to disappear only in its third film (the Indiana Jones franchise could have been the next 007), maybe making this the last film (before the revival with \"Crystal Skull\", that was a mess of bad CGI, blue screen and terrible cinematography), was a good decision by the main trio.As an overall saturday afternoon film, i rate it a 7, but as an Indiana Jones film i rate it a 5, so my final vote is a 6.",

This one, although it has its fair share of action, fights, persecutions and sense of fun, has also some quieter moments, particularly in the first half.It's a return to the more grounded style of the first movie. The antagonist are nazis, the objective is finding a biblical artifact... We see Indy as a teacher, Brody and Sallah are back... I wonder what became of Willie and Short Round.Even if the pace is not always as exhilarating as in the first two movies, what makes this one great is the addition of Sean Connery as Indy's father. The chemistry and banter between Connery and Ford is great, and I also appreciated the insight into Indy's past, including an opening scene when he was in his teens (played by River Phoenix, may he rest in peace).A worthy addition to the most fun pulp adventure movie franchise ever.",

            "content": "OK, let me start by saying that I loved the Indiana Jones franchise up until this point. Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of my all time favorite films, I really enjoyed Temple of Doom (not as good as Raiders but still amazing), so I had very high hopes when I saw Last Crusade for the first time as many of my friends said it was the best in the series and I was very excited to see it for the first time and I assumed it was going to be one of the greatest films ever made. Well I was wrong, Last Crusade let me down more than any film I have ever watched. The opening prologue with River Phoenix was a horrible, contrived mess. Indy somehow gets his fear of snakes, his whip, his hat and his scar all in a matter of 10 minutes, River Phoenix while I have not seen any of his other work gave a god awful performance the \"this should be in a museum\" line makes me cringe every single time. Unfortunately after the opening \"1912\" sequence it doesn't get any better, Harrison Ford seems bored out of his mind and gives an incredibly dull performance, I didn't care much for him in Return of the Jedi and I don't care for him in this either. The supporting cast doesn't do any better, Alison Doody is a laughably atrocious and bland actress , Denholm Elliot is back however he is so different from how he was in Raiders that he might as well be a completely different character, and oh my god he is a complete moron who has been reduced to comic relief and to me is the \"Jar Jar Binks\" of the Indiana Jones franchise (yes I realize this came first). Julian Glover was an amazing Bond villain, I loved him in For Your Eyes Only and in his brief appearance in Empire Strikes Back, I don't know what happened here, again he gave an incredibly boring performance, he wasn't the least bit threatening and gave another terrible performance and then there is Sean Connery, one of the greatest actors ever who has basically been reduced to a bumbling idiot. John Williams score is a complete letdown, one thing that made Temple of Doom so exciting was the music, especially the scene where Indy freed the kids, which gets me pumped up every time. The score of Last Crusade is pretty boring. The plot is simply a rehash of Raiders, while Temple of Doom was not as good as Raiders I do respect it for trying to do something different. I felt the plot of Return of the Jedi was way too similar to A New Hope and I can't give this one a pass either. However what really disappoints me the most about this film is the tone, yeah it is not dark or gritty anymore like the first two were, it is very campy, childish and silly. There is nothing suspenseful about Last Crusade it is pretty much a comedy, a really bad comedy while I'm at it. Yes the first two had funny moments, but they both had dark, witty humor which worked very well. The comedy in Last Crusade is pre-school humor, my evidence: There is a Mickey Mouse joke in an Indiana Jones film!!! After watching the opening of the Ark and the sacrifice scene in the previous two films I never thought we would have jokes about Mickey Mouse but here we are. The film is also riddled with plot holes, there is a moment where Indy and his father are stranded in the middle of Nazi Germany and in the very next scene they are in Hatay (present day Turkey) which is at least 1000 miles away with no explanation!This film disappointed me on every level, the only redeeming quality this film has is yes Walter Donavan's death is kind of cool but it lasts a total of maybe 15 seconds and out of a 2 hour movie that is simply not going to cut it. I cannot watch this film in one sitting, the last time I watched it it took me at least a week to finish because I had to keep turning it off because it was so incredibly cringe worthy. This movie is Batman and Robin level of bad except a film like Batman and Robin is at least the kind of movie you can laugh at and have a good time with, Last Crusade doesn't even rise to that level.OK obviously I don't recommend this movie, go watch Raiders or Temple of Doom, or even Crystal Skulls (yes I said it). Last Crusade just depresses me as it shows a once great franchise with a lot of potential hit rock bottom. I'd give this a zero out of 10 if I could.",

The story with the Grail is interesting, far-fetched of course, but it adds an interesting element of depth to the old good guys - bad guys theme. The pacing of the film is excellent, it is a wild roller-coaster ride from beginning to end that never slackens. We meet a whole range of different characters, each portrayed as individuals with more depth than usual in this type of movie. The interaction between Indiana and his father is believable and again makes this film different and better than the run of the mill action flick. Locations, stunts, train, boat and plane chases, even a tank battle - there is enough here to satisfy any action junkie.But what I liked best is the humour. Where James Bond films make you smile from time to time, this one had me laugh out loud every five minutes. The film makers know that they are here to provide entertainment and don't take themselves too seriously. X never marks the spot - YEAH RIGHT! I won't describe the jokes and gags because I don't want to spoil it, but if you don't find this movie funny I suggest you go and tend to your stamp collection instead of watching films.

            "content": "After the second Indiana Jones movie being a dark film, Steven Spielberg want the third film to be toned down as a lighter film while being dark for a little bit. If that is not all, Spielberg want to show the human side of Indy, while having a relationship with his father Henry Jones Sr. Anything else? Showing the backstory of Indy as a teenager in 1912 where he gets a scar on his chin as well as being afraid by snakes, using the whip and getting the hat; that was George Lucas' idea, by the way. With that said, the movie takes place in 1938 as Indy goes on an adventure to not only search for the Holy Grail that deals with everlasting eternal life, but to search his father while reconnecting with him. The movie itself is still nowhere near on the same level as \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" but it is about as close as it is ever going to get. Spielberg's direction is really outstanding, and really still keeps his audience to be entertain. The movie is also very well written by Jeffrey Boam. The acting is also fantastic as Harrison Ford is still the best as he is Indiana Jones. No questions ask. I really do enjoy seeing Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies returning as Marcus Brody and Sallah. Alison Doody is also really good as playing Dr. Elsa Schneider, and fun as a bad Indy girl. Julian Glover, on the other hand, is good but sadly not as intimidating as Belloq and Mola Ram. As for Sean Connery, he gave such a delightful performance for bringing humor into the table as well as having a great chemistry with Ford. Can't forget about River Phoenix, who is also really good to play the younger version of Indy. If this movie hadn't feature a young Indy, then there wouldn't be \"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\" TV show. I've never seen the show, but I might need to give it a look. John Williams' music is really wonderful to hear as you still hear the Indy theme, and hearing the theme of the father and son relationship. The special effects by ILM are terrific, but like the second film there are some effects that look dated. For example, the scene where Indy throws a Nazi officer out of the zeppelin for having no ticket; the officer gets up and yells at a zeppelin as he being filmed against a blue screen. The action scenes are also exciting, and very well handled. \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" is better than the second Indy movie, but still not on par with the first Indy movie. Nevertheless, this movie has chosen wisely. I gave this movie a 9 out of 10. Now the franchise has laid to rest, Indiana Jones will return until 2008 where we have a movie that deals with aliens, nuking in a refrigerator and leaving audiences feeling empty. Stay tuned as I review a movie that really deserves another chance, and that is \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.\"",

While \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" is more sane than \"Temple of Doom,\" it lacks the adventure of the first and second Jones films. I would say the third one is, overall, better than the second one, but it still isn't a good movie or even close to \"Raiders,\" which itself isn't all that great. The big problem with \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" is that the plot is simply too thin, and after Jones teams up with his father the movie just becomes the Joneses constantly evading the Nazis who are on their tale, and the movie just goes from action scene to action scene with no development at all. To put it bluntly, this third Indiana Jones film is a near-disaster until the end at the Holy Grail, which makes the movie somewhat more interesting. To sum up the series, \"Raiders\" is an adventurous, light fantasy take on the archeology profession, \"Temple\" is an outrageously absurd, over-the-top, but highly adventurous take on archeology, and \"Last Crusade\" is a barely-adventurous, quite-absurd take on archeology.

            "content": "The first time I saw Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, I thought it was okay. The more I saw it, though, the more I liked it. Indiana Jones must find his missing father who was searching for the Holy Grail. Donovan (Julian Glover) dispatches Dr. Jones and Marcus (Denholm Eliot) to Italy where he meets Dr. Schneider (Allison Dody). After a couple of attempts on their lives, they find their way to Austria and locate the elder Dr. Jones (Sean Connery). The Nazis, too, are after the Holy Grail and kidnapped the elder Dr. Jones in hope to find his notebook. It eventually falls into their hands, giving them an edge on finding the ancient relic. This one has it all: fights, chases, comedy, the father-son relationship, beautiful women, and really mean bad-guys. While I liked Temple of Doom, I liked this one much better for several reasons. The first is the introduction in which we meet a young Indiana Jones played by River Phoenix. We learn how he got the scar, his morbid fear of snakes, and his adventurous impulses. The action sequences are also well done. The scene in the dungeon with the oil gives the audience a claustrophobic sense. Following is a great boat chase. There is also a good dogfight scene. The best is the tank scene when Indy is trying to rescue his Dad. Another thing I liked was that the female lead, Dody, was a strong woman who does not appear to be all she is. Not to give it away, but her romantic interests are selfish. This does not allow it to blossom into love, and keeps the movie from being predictable. Also, I liked the villain in this one. Julian Glover's depiction of Donovan is good, giving him a subtle sinister side along with some depth. I really liked Vogel (David Byrne) as the Nazi Commander. In the first movie, we hated the Nazis just because they were Nazis. Byrne, though, portrays evil, impatience, and anger so much better--making you loath him for his character. I liked the incorporation of previous stars like Denholm Eliot and John Rys Davis (Sallah) who were both in the original. Finally, I loved the chemistry between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery as the father and son who could not connect. They made it believable, funny, and entertaining.

Maybe I'm a bit biased for I prefer watching old-school movies, that's how I call movies directed out of a funded script which provides an atmosphere I haven't seen in most of all recent action and adventure movies of today. These movies are intangibly foreseeable and moreover not worth being watched more than one or two times. Surely there are exceptions. But as we say: The exception proves the rule.

I also liked the scene where one of the Knights Templar says, \"He chose poorly.\" It was so dry yet so creepy. It was like he'd seen someone pick the wrong grail loads of times before.Another thing that I like was Sir Sean Connery. His performance was incredible.

This movie starts off with a teenage Indy in the year 1912 and makes us look at an event that molds his life and character as well as his relationship with his father, Henry played by legendary Sean Connery. We also learn he is a \"Junior\" and that he hates to be called that. The job in hand for Indy this time around is to find the \"Holy Grail\" of the time of Jesus Christ. Another motivation for Indy to take this expedition is that his father is lost searching for the same thing . This movie moves from New York to Venice, then from Germany to Alexandria. Yes, Indy encounters the Nazis once again in this movie as in the first edition of the movie. An addition to that is that he encounters the Fuhrer himself.This is surely a better movie than it's previous edition, Temple of Doom. The lead actress in this movie is the best in the entire series, in looks I mean. Ford and Connery charm the audiences with their small father-son fights increasing the humor quotient of the movie which is such an integral part of Indiana Jones franchise. There are some scenes in the movie which makes you question your sanity but that can be considered as a part of cinematic liberties . Overall, a definite one time watch Rating : 7.5/10",

I think the best thing about Indy is that he is somewhat grumpy at times and even a screw up. There are a few times when luck is the only think that saves him in the end, which is a good thing. He's more relatable being imperfect.Add another great character, his Dad, played by the acting god that is Sean Connery, and you have a great duo. Both actors play off each other with hilarious outcomes, definitely making this the funniest Indy movie.Then you add some big, elaborate, over-the-top and creative action sequences, which even to this day stand up against those in present action films (the tank sequence is still awesome), spills, chills, and a very hot lead lady, and you have yourself one great film!So if it's a fantastic action flick you're looking for then take The Last Crusade.",

            "review_title": "Great original - bad sequel",
            "content": "Spoilers!There's always #4 to look forward to. As for this one, Raiders II, it should be - after Indy and Marion found the Ark of the Covenant, with the fire shooting, and the exploding Bellocs, and the tornado of ashes splitting the clouds, and . . .Gee - whatever happened to the Ark? If this is a sequel, and not another 'prequel', what the heck . . happened? That's what's so startling. The answer is - nothing. It's just a new adventure. Even the old serials picked up from the last episode. Indy hasn't been affected. Nothing changed in his character, except that he's now sillier. It makes him seem almost . . insane. Never mind that the writers have taken to denigrating his character with 'we named the dog, Indiana', and whatever else.Apart from that, there are other problems. The music isn't quite as inspiring as with the original. It's just kind of flat. That's hard to explain, since the original film depended so much on the score. Also, there's no follow-on from the previous characters. It's nice that Rhys-Davies and Elliot return, but they now play their characters almost as buffoons - Elliot almost like a small, foolish child (the pen is mightier .. strikingly different that the much more self-possessed and intelligent man in the original film).The quest, of course, isn't really for the Grail, the supernatural superweapon in the wrong hands (not explained why). It's for Dad. But even this is played for yucks. They're in no real sense of danger. The Nazis that imprison them are little more than Keystone Cops. The flaming room never is any real problem, in which the idiot Nazis all seem to get trapped. They should have put big red noses on these guys, and maybe on all the protagonists, as well (Connery is no James Bond, here). It's very different from the much more serious gloss you had in the original, the true sense of adventure - where you had the sense these Nazis were really torturers, were really killers, were really Nazis, and where Indy was perpetually being beaten and dragged and hit and whatever else - in this film, he just kinda skates. In the first film, he was courageous and resourceful. In this one he seems to be reading from a script.The thing with the Grail, too, just doesn't fly. This is supposed to be a magical cup that the Nazis will use for world domination - like the Ark, the monstro laser beam, if you will. That's how it's stated at one point in the film. The Grail can't fall into the Nazi's hands. But when we see it treated basically as little more than a home remedy for gunshot wound, despite all the 'she never really believed in the grail', fact is, nobody in this film really believes in the Grail. This is very different from the first film. It's an afterthought. It's nothing like the Ark - in the myth of these films, anyway. The Grail is sort of like that golden idol in the opening scene of the first Raiders movie. It's not like the Ark.Maybe it's the search for Dad, that throws things off. Try that with the Ark story, and it would have been very different, and prob. not very well remembered. Maybe it's that Connery plays it for laughs, and so does Ford. That's really a darned shame. The first movie had its light moments. But the characters weren't dumbed down to get the laughs. Maybe it's that there aren't really the bad guys, here, but just goofs. Good guys are clowns, bad guys are clowns, and the guardian of the Grail can't even hold onto his sword. Maybe it's because Indy's character hasn't developed or changed, particularly after seeing what he did of the Ark on that island.When they go back to Berlin for the diary, cause Dad can't even remember one of the most important things he wrote (not to mention Indy, who reads the diary on the plane but apparently misses the infamous map - pointed out to him by Brody over a coffee table), they get sort of lost in the crush of adoring fanatics for Der Fuhrer. I think that was sort of the theme of the whole movie - it was just kind of lost in what remained of the Raiders myth, trying to dust the thing off, repair the damage of time, and hope one could go home again to the same kind of movie, finding instead that it's easy to just simply get lost.",

The action sequences at the start of this film are a bit flat on the circus train and are trying too hard to be light hearted, but the Venice speed boat chase and the fight between Indy and the SS Nazi on the huge battle tank more than compensates. Sean Connery is excellent as Dr. Henry Jones, playing him with the correct wit and sense of humour and interacts marvellously with Harrison Ford.

            "content": "I remember when I saw the previews for this movie I was not encouraged: seeing Harrison Ford and Sean Connery as Father and Son bickering like a standup comedy duo in the midst of dangerous situations did not look like a very good idea to me - it seemed too \"cute\"  for the normally gritty Indiana Jones series.  Well, how wrong I was.  Last Crusade is a GREAT movie! I go back and forth in my mind whether this or Raiders is the best of the series. I'd probably have to give Raiders the edge, just for the originality and the action sequences are slightly better, have more punch. But by even forcing me into a comparison, Last Crusade shows the kind of staying power it has. (Just to put my biases right on the table, I thought Temple of Doom was not only the weakest in the series but one of the worst movies ever made - it shares a place on the Lucas/Spielberg  scrap heap along side such stinkers as 1941 and Howard the Duck.)And what makes this film so great IS the relationship between Ford and Connery as father and son. Without that relationship at the center, then yes, this movie would have played too much like a slavish imitation of Raiders. It otherwise has all the same elements: Nazis, quest for Biblical artifact, Sallah and Brody, an Indy fight/chase on a moving vehicle (a truck in Raiders, a tank in Last Crusade), climactic pseudo-religious \"power of God\" sequence, etc. But the presence of Connery, and his interaction with Ford throughout, just changes the entire complexion of the movie. It becomes less about the action (though certainly not skimping on it) and more about Indy's attempts to please his father and build a relationship with him. This may seem, on the surface of it, too precious or \"touchy-feely\" a concept; all I can say is, you need to see the way Ford and Connery handle it. Each performs with subtlety and gruff good humor, not allowing their encounters to sink in dross or sentiment; but equally, not simply tossing them off or treating the whole thing like a joke. Each of them finds an absolutely perfect balance. Ford is especially touching in the way he shows us Indy's barely repressed hostility toward his father, yet at the same time the aching need he has to be validated in his father's eyes - all without once begging for audience sympathy, or losing the sly humor and sense of fun which made us all love Indiana Jones in the first place. In the end, and primarily through the talents of Ford and Connery, the film achieves a poignance which I never would have believed possible - or even advisable - for such a comic book styled action movie.Unlike many others, I also enjoyed the romantic interest here, Dr. Elsa Schneider, played by Allison Doody.  Though certainly not as memorable a character as Karen Allen's Marion in Raiders, she was worlds better than Kate Capshaw in TOD and was ten times as sexy as either one of them. Also, without giving anything away, I like the way the filmmakers worked her character into the story -  she becomes a prime mover of the plot in a way that neither of the other two women were.",

Then there are the bonuses...Sallah and Marcus Brody are back, there is no annoying Short-Round, and (proof that there is a God!!!) no whining Kate Capshaw.

Spielberg and Lucas, also decided to flesh out the back-story of Indiana Jones. In this case, the movie opens with an extended prologue tracking a young Indiana Jones (River Phoenix) through an adventure in which he picks up his trademark fedora, bullwhip, and fear of snakes. What really sparks The Last Crusade was the casting of none other than James Bond himself, Sean Connery in the role of Jones' father. Connery brings his usual sense of wit and brings alive a part that probably on paper, was only that- a part. In essence, The Last Crusade is basically a father/son story, as the search for the grail is also in a way, Indy?s search for the understanding of who his father is as well. This installment also probably has the most humor out of any of the previous films. It is mostly shown throughout the relationship between Indy of his father. All of this is just fantastic to watch, as Ford and Connery mix and match. Though, Indy claims that his pop is just an academic book worm and not a field man? you somehow get the feeling that anything Indy has done, good old dad has done it better- even shall we say sharing the same woman? That scene is just priceless, the way Indy nods, and then the statement catches up with him. Surprise. Everything about this film is just fantastic to watch. My favorite scene is probably after the one where Indy goes after the cup, after just seeing what it had done to Else. Throughout the whole film, his dad calls him Junior? and yet, here for the first time, he calls him Indiana.? Easily the best moment in the film.",

The opening sequence is a very good addition to the movie, and the switch scene from young Indy to the older Indy is great!  I could go on for a while.

All in all, it was certainly better than Temple of Doom, but not as grand and tour de force as Raiders...and by the way...did Indy just dump Marion Ravenwood from the original film???...now, that would have been a classic threesome (Ford, Connery, and Karen Allen). The blonde does nothing for me, except yearn for Austria.  Even the regulars are back from the original film...Marcus and Salah.  The desert chase scene is a rip off from Raiders, however, this time, Indy is up against a huge German tank and more Nazi thugs.",

Most importantly i grew up with the film, as i got older i began to understand it more clearly, for example, that both Joneses slept with Elsa, as a kid i could never understand that. This film has ingrained itself in my subconscious, i purchased a leather jacket that looks curiously close to the one Indy wears. Mind you i hadn't Indiana on my mind at all. It was later perhaps on my 53rd viewing, that i realized the similarity. I just.. love this movie.",

The makers very obviously wanted to close the series with this one so they fixed it up with some finale aspects. What a brilliant idea for an opening sequence. Indy is a boy scout in 1910s and he comes across a dig site, a band of hired thieves has unearthed a cross made of gold and jewels affiliated with it's owner corinado. Firm in his belief that the artifact belongs in a museum he manages to nick the thing and races off under pursuit from the men and the chase moves onto a circus train. He uses a whip for the first time, gets the scar that remained, meets the man you will see an obvious resemblance to in Adult-Indy and more importantly as a losers prize from that very man he gets the hat that despite the nature of his endeavours he manages to hold on to presumably for the rest of his days, that particular little paradox is also commically referenced in the movie as it blows back up to him over the edge of a precipise. There is more history neatly and comically woven in aswell.In his search for the holy grail he once again combats the Nazis, joining him for some of the movie is a brotherhood sworn to the protection of the grails resting place, an idea ripped off by the inferior but still cool 99 flick \"The Mummy\", who ever heard of descendants of any rulers bodyguards anyway. Theres some great punch ups chases and inventive history all through it eg, in his dealings with the Nazi's he at one point comes face to face with none other than the big cheese himself.Anyone who has not seen this movie is missing out on heaps, make it a next seen, it deserves no less than a 9. I still hope they do make a 4th edition, it would be nice to see Indy back in the charts, and to give the new generation a chance to see Indy at the theatre.",

            "content": "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade returns back to its origins: non-stop fun and adventure, while the previous installment, 'Temple of Doom,' seems a bit more heavy-handed. And while it is not as good as the original Raiders of the Lost Ark, it is far better than the other two (soon to be three) in the series. I found that with the fifth installment of the Indiana Jones series coming up next year, I should re-watch the first four. If you have read my reviews for them (which you\nprobably haven't,) you will find that I gave Raiders a 5/5 and Temple a 3.5/5, and I'm still trying my hardest to avoid the carnage known as Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Now, if you haven't noticed, I have given the Last Crusade a 4.5/5. Why you may ask? Because, just like the first one, it is funny and thrilling, and original. (Okay, maybe not original) The original Jones movie featured a standard plot, guy vs Nazis with your standard love interest. It sounds lame, but it works incredibly well thanks to Speilberg's sure-handed direction. For the second one, they didn't have any fresh ideas; just turned the Nazis into some Indian cult thing. The last Crusade keeps the Nazis, which, if I'm going, to be honest, I prefer over the Indian cult with an underground Nike sweatshop. And instead of another lame and predictable romance side plot, it adds Indiana Jones' dad (played by Sean Connery) into the mix. Now that is awesome. Sean Connery and Harrison Ford clearly have nice chemistry in this film, making it funny in between\nall the action sequences, which, despite outdated special effects, are still awesome. (Which is another reason I didn't like Temple, the action sequences are super lame, but you should probably just read my review instead.) If you enjoyed the first one, I suggest you watch this one.\nIt is (almost) as awesome as the first.",

It's not very intense, and I would dare say mild, but the story is great. We actually got two adventures in this film. The mission to find the father, and the quest for the Holy Grail.I could've done without the character of Elsa Schneider. The fact that she seduced, both father and son, was extremely disgusting to me.My favorite scene was definitely when they were captured in the house and this led to the motorcycle chase. The way they escaped was fun to watch, and seeing Indy navigate the motorcycle with a sidecar was cool.Come to think about it, I might like this film more than I thought. I'll rewatch the entire series later on in the year and review again.Do I recommend this? Of course I do, it's Indiana Jones silly.This gets a LennyReviewz Score of: 6/10.",

In his latest adventure, Indiana Jones is on the hunt for the one and only Holy Grail, using clues that his father, played by Sean Connery, left behind. Once again, Indiana Jones has to fight off the Germans, who want their hands on the Holy Grail. Like all the other Indiana Jones films, the Last Crusade contains a sense of humor and in this case between father and son. My favorite scenes is the tank battle in the desert and inside the temple that holds the Holy Grail. Indiana Jones faces three intelligently made booby traps that his father had figured out with clues. If you don't believe me, watch the Last Crusade! The acting is once again brilliant and the work of Spielberg and Lucas are fantastic. I give this film an 11/10. Although this may be a long movie, it is definitely worth watching and no Indiana Jones fan should miss. Harrison Ford is once again the courageous and funny archaeologist who teams up with his explorer father, Professor Henry Jones. Truly the best adventure yet, the Last Crusade will amaze audiences everywhere. I have seen the conclusion of the current Indiana Jones adventures and I wish Spielberg, Lucas, Ford good luck on the fourth installment!",

The Last Crusade really gets back to the original feel of the first movie, and really comes across as an Indiana Jones movie this time.In the first few scene of The Last Crusade, we are shown some back story for Indiana which really works well. We are shown why he chose his profession, how he got his hat, we are introduced to his father. The acting is great in this movie, as is in all the movies. Harrison Ford does another great at convincing the audience that he is Dr. Jones. Sean Connery does a superb job as Indiana Jones' father. We are introduced to some new, and interesting characters along the way. The story is really good. Once again involving the Nazi's. This time trying to help find the Holy Grail. Along the way we get some very good scenes filled with action. The tank chance through the desert is very well done. The boat chase is also very well done.

First off, all of the movies are great movies but I can peck holes at some of the grossness of the monkey brains and open-heart sacrifices in Temple of Doom that disgust some audiences and some of the unbelievability that has to do with aliens landing on Earth then flying back to space at the end of The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull that irks some viewers. Again both great movies that I enjoyed just not as much as films one and three. In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade we get to meet Indiana's dad & of course he had to be played by none other than Sean Connery. It is interesting to note that when George Lucas and Steven Spielberg were developing Indiana Jones on the beaches of Hawaii at a vacation after the success of the first Star Wars movie, they were basing the character of Jones on James Bond of the British spy movies, so it only seems fitting that everyone's favorite Bond play Jones' dad! In The Last Crusade - as I will call it for short - Jones is tasked with finding the cup of Christ, the actual cup that Jesus drank from during the last supper before his execution. Originally this assignment was tasked to the elder Jones, someone more academically versed on the subject, but the Nazi's kidnapped him putting Indiana into play. Many fun twists and turns occur in this movie that is very much a buddy movie, very much a father-son movie, and very much a family movie. The acting is tremendous, the writing is great, the soundtrack is outstanding, the costuming is fine, and it simply is a fun way to spend a couple hours with friends and/or family and learn a few things in the process!! 7 out of 10 stars!!",

This version has more action, better one liners, and a way better plot than the past 2 Indy flicks. Old Indy is racing the nazis once more, this time, he teams up with his Steve Urkelesque father Henry (played brilliantly by Sean Connery, who completely hides his James Bond image away!) to find the holy grail. While being chased and shot at, Henry keeps treating his son as if he were a little kid still, i.e. hitting him in the face and calling him Junior! But I'm not saying that's bad. It's really a very funny element. Harrison Ford does exceptionally well, too, beating up nazis, dealing with devious allies, and putting up with his nerdy dad. All in all, the best film ever in the adventure category. Best line: (arguing over the grail diary)Henry Sr.: \"I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers!\"",

            "content": "My opinion of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade could be deemed slightly biased. It is the first film I ever saw in theaters and it's also the first movie I purchased on video. I even own the same, worn-down, beat-up copy (and look upon it even more fondly than the widescreen edition, for sentimental reasons, of course). I think it's fair to say it's this movie that cemented my love of cinema, the high regard I hold for great escapism, which is sorely lacking from today's cinema; movies that should be fun now drag or bludgeon themselves with relentless awful scripts or MTV-style direction that turns relatively simple scenes into chaotic blurs. The Last Crusade may only be thirteen years old, but I think I can safely say they don't make them like they used to. The film stars, of course, Harrison Ford as Indy Jones, the archaeologist/adventurer who's on yet another quest, this time to find his father, who'd been searching for the Holy Grail. Said Dad is played by none other than Sean Connery, whose highly charismatic performance is quick to place this film above the others in the trilogy. The rest of the film focuses on this ongoing journey between father and son (eventually joined along by Sallah and Marcus Brody), complete with amazing action and stunt sequences, clever humor, and nasty (but fun) surprises. The script, by Jeffrey Boam, takes a few cues from Raiders of the Lost Ark, but actually improves upon that story by adding more characterization, particularly with origin of Indy himself. And as a whole, the story is more engrossing because there are more fun clues offered toward the location of the Holy Grail and, thus, more engaging little discoveries (love the \"X marks the spot\" scene). I'm quite certain, like with Raiders, the plot has a few holes, but they're fairly hard to notice, and I've seen the movie quite a few times, but maybe it's just my enjoyment of the film clouding that up, which I suppose speaks volumes in favor of Spielberg's direction and the performances. Given that action and adventure is the series' selling point, you can expect the thrills and wondrous delight of discovery delivered in spades. The action scenes are terrific (and matched well with John Williams' rousing, memorable score), the best being an excellent ten-minute setpiece on board (and in) a Nazi tank in a sensational chase sequence across the desert. The climax, complete with frightening booby traps, is a suspenseful venture into the unknown, which is the pinnacle adventure movies aspire to. Harrison Ford once again slides effortlessly into the role of Jones, delivering another first-rate turn. To some, the performance is a joke; to most, it's acting at its finest. But I think most everyone would agree nobody else could have fit the part half as well as Ford. It's his rapport with Connery that strikes that spark that separates this from 99% of the genre. They craft an uncannily touching, funny, and genuine bond unlike any duo in film history. You could call it a buddy picture, I suppose, but unlike any you've ever seen before. The Last Crusade is a knockout thrill ride, and I seriously doubt any action/adventure will ever surpass it.",

But one problem I have with Last Crusade is the mythos and esoterica surrounding the \"Holy Grail\" seem to be a bit too campy for my taste. I just never imagined a Christian artifact giving immortality at least not in This Life.However, the film works because the characters are never flat, as with virtually all Spielberg, this is probably the Indy film that explores his recurring exploration of the theme of father-son relationships, and is done so here much more blatantly.Last Crusade has one of the most absurdly preposterous, yet entertaining slapstick action sequences, the \"rotating wall\" sequence, and even the little bit where Indy bumps into Hitler and has to pretend the precious diary is a mere book he wants der Fuhrer to autograph is sure to give audiences nervous laughter. Very nervous laughter, I'm sure.Spielberg has always been a creator of - besides his heavy epic films; highly watchable, wholesome, low faluting entertainment that no one has to feel guilty for being pleased about.5/5",

            "content": "Though the story is similar in many respects to Raiders (Indy races the Nazis to an artifact which Hitler wants for world domination), Last Crusade is less about plot and more about character, relationships, and comedy. If Raiders is the smartest film in the trilogy, and Temple of Doom is the most exciting, Last Crusade is by far both the funniest and the most emotionally involving, rendering it many fans' favorite film of the series (including mine).The film has the all of the excellent action sequences, creepy- crawly moments, mysticism, exotic locales, and booby traps that one expects from an Indiana Jones movie. It's a nonstop pursuit: in this case, vehicular chases are the norm, with all sorts of stunt-filled highlights involving trains, boats, motorcycles, planes, and tanks.What truly sets it apart is a script that, beginning with the intro of Sean Connery's character 45 minutes in, is loaded with almost nonstop comedy, with a finale is both truly touching and thrilling. What's more, it's not just comedy for the sake of laughter; the humor establishes the characters' relationships and moves the story along. While both Harrison Ford and Sean Connery are absolutely iconic actors, neither of them has ever, before or since, displayed such comedic prowess, and it's obvious that both of them are having the time of their life.One of the neat things about the Indiana Jones movies is that each film reveals something new about our hero's character. There are different virtues and flaws on display each time. Raiders gave us a taste of his romantic side, his academic mind, and his tenacity against obstacles. Temple of Doom highlights his capacity for both greed and compassion, as well as a paternal side in his relationship with Short Round. Last Crusade, without laying it on too thick, shows a man who is still aching from a lonely childhood.This larger-than-life hero, who smirks at Nazis and courageously challenges a tank while on horseback (armed with just a pistol!), is vulnerable only to his father's disapproval. He resents the man who \"taught him self-reliance\" but discovers that he respects and loves that man as well. Of course the movie handles it in a way that is more subtle and less sappy than I've made it sound, but it's there nonetheless. Connery, on the other hand, plays gloriously against type as a bookish old man, unaccustomed to danger, but still with hidden strength. He and Ford have a glowing chemistry here, and it's their interplay that elevates this from \"very good\" to \"truly great.\" * * * * 1/2 (out of five).",

            "content": "OKAY, I can honestly say that I have read over 180 comments on this film (I'm studying it), and its appalling to read those who dismiss it and then admit they didn't even watch it all (because it was 'so' boring). You can't snub a film without watching the entirety first. Anyway, as I mentioned before, I have read a lot of comments and I wanted to write my own (after reading all the negative comments).  Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I just don't agree with many, and I'm sure many won't agree with me:Firstly, For those of you who believe that the scene where young Indy finds his hat, whip, scar, love for adventure, and fear of snakes all in 10 minutes is \"the most contrived and unbelievable\" thing you have seen, then you are somewhat arrogant. To just blow it off as 'unbelievable' is weak, could you perhaps just ask yourself that maybe all he needed was inspiration. Indy found his inspiration within Fedora (the one who gave him his hat). Already Fedora inspired him to 1) find his love for adventure 2) find his 'look' for adventure. Indy met him once, but maybe all he needed was just a little inspiration, which is just what Fedora provided. Ok, I agree adding in his whip and fear of snakes was a little far-fetched, but don't completely call it 'contrived' or 'unbelievable.'Secondly, its a movie. Must everything in a movie represent reality all the time?? I suppose evil aliens really will visit earth, take over our satellites and begin destroying the world. Or that there is a spy who was frozen for 40 years then unfrozen so he could take on his arch-nemesis.The purpose of a movie is to temporarily remove the viewer from reality and place them 'inside' the movie, accepting what ever unfolds. I accepted the fact that Indiana and his father were fighting Nazi planes in the air, I didn't say `wait a minute. No. that blue screen is way too cheesy. I can SEE how fake it is. This is definitely ruining my movie watching experience.' I just accepted it as it was, they at least ATTEMPTED to make it look decent which is fine by me. A movie is supposed to be enjoyed, not immediately dismissed because of minor 'flaws.'Another commenter mentioned that they found the whole father/son relationship too 'loopy' and he had never mentioned his father in earlier films. If you had actually watched the film you would have noticed he held a resentment towards his father, thus he would not have mentioned him any earlier. He didn't really believe his father was a good 'father-figure' and never really spoke to him since they had that \"quite drink,\" - a milkshake, 20 years earlier.AND to those who even CONSIDER temple of doom to be better than the last crusade must be INSANE. Ok! I can handle the unrealistic parts in a movie, but an 8 yr old kid karate chopping people was going a little too far. Also the love interest played a very annoying part, they should have killed her off 5 minutes after she went on screen.The one-liners were great in the last crusade, and the chemistry between Connery and Harrison didn't fail us, they were great together and Connery bought in a refreshing new character in the Indiana Jones story. For those who didn't find sean connery, or the one-liners the slightest bit funny, then I really do feel sorry for you.I'm not saying The Last Crusade is the best movie of all time. I mean, its a great movie, but it does have a few flaws. Then again, what movie doesn't? The only complaints I really have is the way they turned Marcus Brody into a complete imbecile. They could have least made him slightly more intelligent, it's not like they needed him for comic relief, Connery was handling that fine. Also, I have to admit that it seemed to lack originality. However, although it followed the same basic storyline, it didn't fail to keep me entertained. In what other film can you find a boat, train, plane, bike and tank action sequences, plus drama, comedy, action, adventure, romance AND including issues such as faith, morals, betrayal, family, etc.. NO ONE can possibly say that this film was a complete failure! And if they do, then they cant appreciate a good film when they see one.",

The supporting cast are also on the ball, particularly Sean Connery who plays Indiana's father extremely well. The film is a bit of the Sean Show, he gets most of the best one liners and best physical comedy jokes. Connery plays the character with the same charm,wit and charisma as Harrison's Indiana.The special effects are great for the time and everything looks good. The script is also well written, Spielberg's direction is always excellent and this film is no different. Just an all round good fun movie.9/10, A Superb way to end a FANTASTIC Trilogy.",

            "content": "The Temple of Doom was not received favourably so the Spielberg/Lucas partnership decided, understandably, to return to the formula of Raiders of the Lost Ark.  As a result, we see the return of two of Jones' friends from the first film, another race against the Nazis for a religious treasure and more action in the desert.  For some reason, an English actor was cast to play American villain Walter Donovan.  We also find that Indiana's father was a Scotsman.  Both father and son are deceived by the allure of an attractive woman, which is a great power women can have over men (so Indiana Jones is only human after all).  I though Michael Byrne was rather good as an ageing Nazi henchman and Marcus Brody becomes the butt of most of the humour (expertly played by Denholm Elliott).  Probably the most powerful scene in any of the Indiana Jones movies comes towards the end, when the callous Donovan shoots Indiana's father (when you watch it you'll see what I mean).  For me, the inclusion of the big star (i.e. Connery) does not lift the film above Raiders (as some people seem to think) because it would take more than a gimmick to achieve that.  This film is too much of a rehash and many of the effects are actually poorer.",

As far as the story goes it is as good as any and Connery and Ford play off each other incredibly well. But with their chemistry comes the reason why Last Crusade falls short of The original Raiders movie, it is to light and unlike the first movie relies on the situations for the comedy and not the characters. Also the Indiana Jones character was by this time turned into to much of a good guy without flaws. One can not forget how a great character such as Marcus Brody was compromised for comedic purposes.My other major complaint being that Last Crusade doesn't have the incredible action sequence that knocks your socks off.In raiders we had the chase through the streets, and the truck chase, and in Doom we had the opening sequence and the mine cart ride. What did we have in Crusade? We had a tank sequence and a motorcycle chase neither would rank in my five Indy action sequences. But what does save the movie are incredible scenes which make you care about the characters like the climax and the unforgettable image of Indy and friends riding off into the sunset.",

It also brings in a lot more depth to the character of Indiana than we had seen before.Unfortunately some of the effects are of their time (pre 90s/CGI) so what we have definitely dates the movie, however fortunately it doesn't detract from the presentation on the whole.For me this has the best and most complete and well thought out story of the Indiana jones movies, that being said the original is probably more impactful.

It also was a masterpiece of cunning subtext and pure action. \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" was just as inventive, just as entertaining as the original, just a little more over-the-top. \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" feels more mature and grown up.This is a good thing, I think. It makes sense for a movie like this to be more mature when it is dealing with more mature issues. The unknown is the theme of the other movies. This movie deals with family matters more than anything. That's what adds to the new kind of entertainment this film evokes. This is the original bit. The rest is like a collection of newspaper clippings.Oh, sorry, there's something else that's original! The introduction with young Indy is also original!! I thought River Phoenix was superb.

When Indy went over the cliff near the end, I thought that he was actually dead. Had I first seen this movie as an adult, I no doubt would have said to myself that he'd be climbing back up any moment.Last Crusade loses a little bit of its luster as an adult viewer. Although the interplay between Ford and Connery is often very funny, I'm not sure that the character or the story called for the added depth of the whole Spielberg estranged father thing. It feels a bit tacked on, as if Spielberg wanted it there just because that's his thing. It doesn't necessarily detract from the story, but I'm not sure if it needed to be there.

It seems the writers wanted to recreate the magic of the first film, so again, Jones is chasing after a Biblical artifact and fighting Nazis. Gone is the silly, over the top plot of Temple of Doom. However, many of the scenes are boring. Jones spends too much time chasing Nazis around Europe instead of being in a tomb or temple, which is where the series shines. Too much time is also spent explaining the somewhat convoluted backstory. All we need to know is the Nazis are the bad guys. I don't care about the rest. Get on with the action already.The characters are dull and forgettable, in my opinion. As soon as I saw Elsa, I thought, \"You can't trust a face like that\". She's too attractive. Of course she ended up being a bad guy. Extremely predictable. Extremely clich\u00e9. Then for the remainder of the film, (which is two thirds), she's hardly in the film at all. And that's the problem. Once Elsa disappears, the film lacks a strong female lead. Instead we are stuck with Indy's father. I kept thinking, \"Can't Indy drop off his father at a bingo hall somewhere and get back to the action?\" I liked his father but he got annoying toward the end. This leads to my next complaint. Why are all the main characters so old? It's like the director went to the local retirement home to do the casting for the movie. Indy's father is 70-80. So is their friend, Brody, and so is the villain. Really the villain is the most generic villain possible. He's basically an old guy who happens to be a Nazi, a complete 180 from Temple of Doom where the villain was a cartoon character brought to life.My biggest complaint are the action scenes. Don't get me wrong. They're good, but the movie lacks an over the top, epic action scene like the earlier movies. Raiders of the Ark had the giant stone ball. Temple of Doom had the rope bridge and mine cart scene. The last crusade has ... nothing that defines the franchise. There is no single moment you remember ten years later. In fact, Jones spends very little time in actual tombs or temples dodging booby traps and solving puzzles. That's what sets Indiana Jones apart from other action movies. It's unfortunate the writers seem to have forgotten that. Overall, it seems the movie made an obvious attempt to reign in the over the top theatrics of Temple of Doom but in my opinion, went a bit too far. What you are left with is a good film but not a great film. One that falls short of capturing the magic of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Personally I prefer Temple of Doom over this. Yes, that film was ridiculous at times but at least it was more fun. This is more of a standard, all around generic action film.",

Just like the first 2 films in the franchise it has everything you have come to expect from an Indiana film. I also love that we get to see a small taste of our hero's childhood. It follows the exact same formula as the first 2 but that's what makes a successful franchise. Some of the old favorite characters return and join in on the adventure which was a refreshing change. With this film Spielberg and Lucas insured that they created a truly successful trilogy of films that could even rival Star Wars. I would go so far as to say that in some ways Indiana Jones is a stronger trilogy than the first Star Wars trilogy simply because with this film Indiana really does end on a strong note.",

After a miss with the entertaining yet forgettable Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade comes pretty close to doing just that.Film history's most profitable star Harrison Ford returns to his signature role in a performance that speaks for itself, and benefits greatly from a gallery of memorable supporting characters. That includes Sean Connery, the grandest of all modern action day movie heroes (and appropriately cast, as the spiritual father of the character is James Bond). Connery plays against that, in a performance that is different than anything he has ever done, and it works. Even so, Denholm Elliott can't seem to help stealing every scene he's in as Marcus Brody, a lifelong friend of the Jones family.\nThis movie stands by itself in the way it deals with spirituality, and is thick with religious themes throughout, without preaching to you. This is a very difficult balance to acheive in any film, and that alone makes the film stand out as brilliant. It is more abundant with humor than the previous two films, without the characters falling into irritating self-parody. Being a sequel, this is a difficult balance to acheive as well. (Look at action sequels such as Lethal Weapon 4).This film stands among the greatest action adventures of all time. I don't know anyone who hasn't seen it, but if you haven't, don't walk to see it.

Spielberg seems to be enjoying himself so much directing this film that the sense of fun, excitement and sheer movie joy is infectious on us all.

Never been topped, never probably will be topped.I know Raiders of the Lost Ark is widely regarded as the best Indy movie, because it was the first. But I think it's only the second best.Last Crusade is not just more entertaining, but it also deepens the character of Indiana Jones in a way that Raiders never did. His childhood, father relation, what made him the man he is. And where he got that scar, hat, whip and name from.The movie's first act is good too, but things really kick off once Sean Connery (RIP) enters the frame. The comedic chemistry between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery is just gold, almost Chaplinian physical comedy combined with great verbal comedy. And most of it takes place during an epic chase scene, which would be great on it's own. And that scene at the fireplace trapdoor just gets me every time. And who could forget the autograph by Hitler lol. Or \"...no ticket...\" and the reaction it creates. The whole movie is just filled with legendary scenes and jokes, really. Hard to pick.The final act, the tank chase scene, and the dramatic Grail trials, everything is just perfectly executed. \"He chose poorly\". While I think the funniest segment of the movie is the mid part. The ending is more dramatic, fittingly so.I mean, how can you say on a straight face that Raiders is better? Just how. I get it, it was the first, it's the most original, but still... this is one of those rare sequels that tops the original one. (Aliens and T2 come to mind too, not much else)",

            "content": "This movie suffers from a serious flaw. It is bad enough to hear Nazis speak English with a horrible German accent, but hearing a Nazi speak German with the accent of a native English speaker is intolerable. The way Dr. Schneider pronounces \"Eins\" is a dead giveaway. The \"Ei\" in \"Eins\" is not the same as \"I\" in the English language. \"I\" is pronounced with a rounded mouth. The corners of the mouth have to be stretched to the left and right to pronounce the \"Ei\" in \"Eins\". I (Friederike) grew up bilingually; my parents are German but I lived in England for the first few years of my life and speak both languages without a foreign accent, so I know what I am talking about.Because of this serious flaw I can not give the movie more than five stars, however good it may be else.Why did Spielberg not get a good language adviser and trainer for the movie? The trick of pronouncing \"ei\" correctly in German is quite easy to learn.The only supposed German who gets the pronunciation right is a soldier who says \"Die Amerikaner k\u00e4mpfen wie Weiber\" (\"The Americans fight like women\"); the actor was probably German. All other \"Germans\" in the movie speak with the accent of a native English speaker. The way one actor pronounced \"nach\" (which at the point it was used meant \"towards\")was simply ridiculous and bore no resemblance whatever to the correct pronunciation. This is extremely sloppy for a movie having such a big budget.Another thing that was sloppy: Hitler' autograph in the diary bears no resemblance whatever to Hitler's real autograph, though this could easily have been done.",

In that regard it is PERFECT because it isn't too overworked in the details. Those movies were pumped out at a terrifyingly fast rate and as such generally had a minimum of effort expended (if only due to time constraints).The German Language uses the same alphanumerics as English with the exception that some of the characters have special accents and emphasis. So Mr. Hitler's signature was authentic, enough. Again whether Hitler was left or right handed takes away the question of what this movie was. Hitler approaching Indy was just supposed to be another incredible moment of impending doom. The guy could have just as easily been Dolf Lungren (and I am not even sure he knows how to write) if the impact had been generated (which it wouldn't have been).For my vote, there is NO way that the second one even comes close to the first of the last. Kate Capshaw is such a limp weed that she isn't even convincing when she's supposed to be mad. I would think that angry would be one of the easier moods to demonstrate while acting.I'm not too impressed with the \"love interest\" in the last movie either, but she's easier to ignore with Sean Connery on the screen. Also, let's not forget that it is the third movie that offers the flashback at the beginning, of a young Indiana Jones (River Phoenix).

It's way less serious than I remember - which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It feels like Spielberg and co. Know exactly what makes Indy films fun and they lean into those moments more than their first attempt at a sequel. This movie is loads of fun from start to finish with great action sequences and plenty of quotable moments.The Last Crusade corrects the misfires of Temple of Doom and it is worth mentioning. While not a total disaster, the Temple of Doom ventures too far away from what makes Indiana Jones great and it feels like a severe drop off from Raiders. The Last Crusade makes concentrated efforts to fix those decisions. I won't dive into every area where there are improvements but the most glaring example is in its supporting characters being fun and interesting rather than being obnoxious/annoying - characters are there for story reasons and not pure comedic relief and it shows.Overall, The Last Crusade is a fantastic trilogy finale and it earns its ride into the sunset moment.8/10.",

            "content": "This last installment in the Indiana Jones Trilogy is... eh, where the series should've ended. This great adventure is just as good, if not better than Raiders of the Lost Ark. This time, the creators bring in Indy's father, played by Sean Connery, which is how to movie gets it's heart. The best moments of this picture are all about the father and son bonding in the face a danger. The sequence in which they are tied up in the castle while it burns to the ground, is one of the most suspenseful yet hilarious scenes in a movie.Of course, I have to mention it, that it's no coincidence that the first James Bond was played by Sean Connery. Besides those other classic films mention in my Raiders Review, the James Bond films were the true predecessors to Indiana Jones. Sean Connery was always Steven Spielberg's first choice to play Indiana Jones's dad, as an inside joke to say that James Bond is the father of Indiana Jones. If that had failed, Gregory Peck and Jon Pertwee were back-up choices for the role. With that aside, Bond would always find himself in a ridiculous situation where no human being could possibly escape alive. It's all about setting a trap and seeing how the hero escapes.It's interesting to hear how when George Lucas met with Steven Spielberg to discuss a third Indiana Jones movie, he wanted to have it set in a haunted mansion. Spielberg had just finished Poltergeist and decided that he wanted to do something different. Lucas then came up with the idea of the Holy Grail and Spielberg added the whole father & son story. Lots of fascinating trivia exists about how the script was developed; Harrison Ford cut his chin in a car accident in Northern California when he was about 20. In the movie, this cut is explained by young Indiana Jones cutting his chin with a whip.Now... you're probably wondering what I thought of the actual film. Well, to simply put, it's great fun adventure film, just like the other two movies, but is enhanced by the all the father and son interactions. One of the more famous names in the business is what Henry Jones would call Indiana Jones: \"Junior!\" and the response from Indy: \"Don't call me Junior!\"I could go on and on, but seriously, just go watch. It really is a great movie that gives a little background about Indy near the start of the movie, it brings the curtain down on the franchise with a great sunset shot, and, best of all, has incredible action scenes.

The point of view from the film came from first person and the director did a great job using the camera to show the viewers just exactly what you needed to see. Superimposing a temporary title on the screen during scene changes was used a lot in the film in order to inform the viewers of the setting, which started in Utah-1912 and ended in Venice, Italy. The two main characters in this film are Indiana Jones and his father. These characters are described through indirect characterization, which is their appearance and actions are judged by the viewers. The plot is when Indiana Jones is searching for the Holy Grail but finds it difficult and this builds the climax. The relationship between Indy and his father is not very strong at first because his father never agrees with him until his father was shot and Indy needed the Holy Grail in order to save his father. In the end, Indy's father told him to let the Holy Grail go. This raised some questions because viewers could have taken that as to let the Holy Grail go or let the past go and build up their relationship. Technical elements were used greatly throughout the film. The camera techniques consist of framing, panning and zooming in and out. This made you focus on the important thing s and kept your attention. Indiana the song was a major point in the sound technique because it played when a key moment struck.

It had a lot of different techniques to show you what was going on in the movie, instead of just saying words and telling you what was going on. The plot of the movie is for Indiana Jones to find is father. His father disappeared while looking for the Holy Grail, so Indiana is willing to go and find him. Once he was found, the relationship between the two was very strange. They did not seem to get along with each other, because they did not agree on anything. The setting of the movie fit very well with the movie. The scenery made you feel like it was set back in the olden days, which made the story more realistic. It also made it seem more adventurous, by using older weapons. They did this, because technology was not used as much then, so it gave it an older look. For the most part, this movie is told from Indiana Jones point of view. The character are of course a major part of the move. The main character in this film was Indiana Jones. He was represented by a wipe and a hat. A big thing that I noticed in this movie was the sounds techniques. If something was going wrong, bad sounding music would always play. But when Indiana was doing something good, his theme song would begin to play. The music set the stage for what was about to happen in that certain scene. Lighting was used to help set the scene and help you to focus on certain things on the set. They also used lighting in the movie for a lot of shadowed objects. Many camera techniques were also used in this film. They consisted of framing, panning, and juxtaposition. This made you focus on the important things and kept your attention on what was going on at the time of the movie. The end of the movie surprised me, when his father told him to forget the Holy Grail. It was a major curve of the movie that I did not except and was not ready for.

After seeing the Mummy last weekend, I felt the urge to revisit the old classic...and it still has that 'wow' factor. Unlike the F/X fest that is the Mummy..there is actually characters that draws you in. Indy's relationship with his father, interwined with the quest for the Holy grail signify the importance of family and sacrifice, and underlying message within the film. The humble will be rewarded.  Superb action scenes and frenetic pacing, reminiscent to all of Lucasfilm's trilogies are prevalent. This is still one of Spielberg's more successful foray into the genre and something that all blockbuster films should look up to. (9/10)",

In Last Crusade they did nearly everything as it should be done. It's the one which feels the most like a James Bond movie does - and this is what the both wanted to achieve according to the common rumors and what I personally like the most. The movie has the right amount of humor, wonderful locations, interesting characters, a sophisticated story and, of course, breathtaking action and suspense. Maybe one could have cast the female part more carefully choosing an equally beautiful actress which happens to cause more chemistry in interaction with Harrison Ford and Sean Connery. Nonetheless Alison Doody is far the best \"Jonesgirl\" we've seen until now. Hopefully Lucas and Spielberg progress again in the next sequel announced for 2008 - if not, they will not be able to blame it on a lack of time.",

Regardless, it was a quality film, with great action scenes, and although it didn't keep me on the edge of my seat, I finally got to see what all the hype was about. Steven Spielburg is definitely has some of the best family movies, but I really liked his other pieces, like Jaws and E.T much better I look forward to finishing watching the other movies in the trilogy I have missed. I know the majority of people will disagree with my comments, and probably more so with my rating, but 6 stars out of 10 is still a good movie, maybe not fantastic, but still good.",

            "content": "Indiana Jones is going a little grey around the temples, but he's not lost his knack for getting into trouble in the search for religious antiquities. He should really know better by now. This movie heralds a return to the formula that made Raiders so enjoyable and in doing so marks Temple of Doom as the clear odd-man-out of the trilogy. Denholm Elliot and John Rhys Davies, both missing from the previous film, make a welcome return, as do Nazis, globe-trotting quests and those great scenes featuring Indy trying to cut it as a college lecturer and finding it slightly more challenging than fighting off scimitar-wielding arabs. And then there's Sean Connery.The moment Connery first appears as Henry Jones Sr. (Indy's change of name is explained in the movie) the enjoyment level, previously at 10, gets turned up to 11. Every scene he shares with Harrison Ford is a joy. In Connery's presence, Indiana Jones: Adventurer and Action Hero becomes Jones Junior: Upstart and Very Naughty Boy. When Indy machine-guns a room full of Nazis in order to make an escape, Dad's reaction is not \"Yeah! You kicked butt! Now let's get the hell outta here!\", rather it's \"Look at what you've done!\" It's more than just refreshing, it's absolutely inspired.The plot's familiar. Indy races against the forces of evil (Nazis) to recover a mythical artifact. As before there is plenty of action and romance, but there's a little more humour than in the first two movies. Speilberg even indulges in the odd little in-joke. (For example - Indy and female companion are examining some ancient paintings: \"What's that one?\"... \"The ark of the covenant\"... \"You sure?\"... \"Pretty sure!\"... cue a two second snippet of John Williams ark theme from Raiders). What this film does lack, however, is a really memorable boo-hiss-able baddie. Julian Glover's Donovan is clearly an attempt to mimic Belloq from Raiders, but he's way too smug, way too wet, and has none of the arrogance and obsession-bordering-on-madness that Paul Freeman had as Belloq. And if Glover is wet, the nazis are wetter - even Hitler comes across as kind of a nice guy.It's a small complaint though. This is really a great and worthy successor to Raiders. It's everything Temple of Doom should have been but wasn't.9/10",

Great critic Roger Ebert put it as 6th best film of the entire decade, only behind \"Raging Bull\", \"The Right Stuff\", \"E.T\", \"Do the Right Thing\" and \"My Dinner with Andre\". Of course, in 1984, the dark sequel/prequel was released, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Yeah, this one was neither. People thought it was too \"dark\". Critics thought it didn't live up to what Spielberg was doing.\nWell, anyways, we're here to talk about the Last Crusade. This time he is looking for the Holy Grail, which was his father's obsession. He has got his father's diary (clich\u00e9), and he is obviously better than him (another clich\u00e9). But we don't get to see Henry until the movie reaches 50 minutes or so, and it is a pleasant surprise, since Henry may be the best part of the film. The movie ends in a huge temple, with Indiana and his father getting out in a wonderful sunset.\nBut it is nowhere near flawless. Jones does in 5 minutes what his dad couldn't do in more than 40 years. That's ridiculous. There is another scene where the Nazis tie him with his dad and leave the room. Haha. You've got one of the most agile person in the world, you know about his reputation, and you leave him alone with his dad, and with a lighter? There are many of these flaws. But it serves for its purpose, which is being an entertaining film. I like it. But it certainly isn't better than Raiders",

The already great musical score has just become even better with some great tunes which really bring the scenes to life. The whole film has bucket-loads of superb action sequences which include some very good visual effects. The sheer magnitude of what has been achieved in just 1 film really is astonishing.

Chock full with more Nazis, rousing action sequences, and sarcastic, sometimes tongue-in-cheek humor and noticeably more character development than the first two. And seriously, who better to play Indiana Jones' father than Sean Connery? He gives a hilarious, and yet, sophisticated performance that does not fail to make me laugh every time. The plot to the movie is Indiana goes on the hunt for his father, after he disappears while working on a project to recover the legendary Holy Grail, the cup of Christ, etc. Jones himself gets caught up in the intrigue, ending up helping his fathers assistant (Allison Doody) discover more clues to the grails' wherabouts. Indy eventually learns that his father was captured by Nazis, and that they are planning to make their armies immortal by using the grails' power. The movie then really picks up, with Indy and father on the run from a ruthless Nazi Colonel (Michael Byrne) on a mission to find the grail before the Nazis do. On the way, they are spectacular action sequences, including a tank chase scene through the desert, a boat chase through Venice and car chase through rural Germany. And with Spielberg behind the camera and his sharp eye for that perfect shot of Indy thrawting another Nazi, well, give me one valid reason not to watch time and again.",

            "content": "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade...........I first saw that this film was in the works around December 1987 when Temple of Doom was receiving its Uk TV premiere. I really enjoyed Raiders Of The Lost Ark, and its sequel was good fun but not as much as the first film. Then in summer 1989 I saw the third film and I was severely disappointed.Gone where the scary special effects to be replaced by Sean Connery's character who does provide some great comedy. I just couldn't enjoy this one as much as the other two as I'm afraid it really feels like a straight sequel to Raiders where the writers try to recreate the action sequences of the first film. Unfortunately, Indiana Jones seems to to have peaked with his first outing as both Temple Of Doom and Last Crusade are just not better than the original. Unlike Star Wars, where the second film is clearly better. I really think that George Lucas lost something since 1981...I haven't enjoyed any of his work since more than Raiders, Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back.",

            "content": "Of all the franchises in the history of film-making, not a single one boasts a better third installment than The Last Crusade. This movie has it all: action, comedy, adventure, mystery, horror, romance, and a perfect way to end a flawless trilogy. Last Crusade also has the most depth of the trilogy. The whip cracking, Nazi fighting, archaeology adventure was still there, but with the third film, audiences were shown Indinan's origins and how Henry Jones Jr. became Indiana. The addition of Sean Connery as Indy's father gave the movie an extra dose of humor and a connection to Spielberg's inspiration for the series \u2014 James Bond. Connery was initially skeptical about the role because he's only 12 years older than Harrison Ford. But being that James Bond was the original inspiration for the character, producers were set on bagging Connery. Once Connery was on board, he and Harrison Ford had instant chemistry. A lot of scenes where improvised by the actors like the one where Sean Connery says the line \"She talks in her sleep.\" The script, by Jeffrey Boam, improves on it's previous by paying more attention to characterization. The whole supporting cast is all- around great; John Rhys-Davies is back as Sallah, funny and wonderful as ever. Denholm Elliot also returns as Marcus Brody, the lovable goof form Raiders of the Lost Ark. Alison Doody plays Elsa the backstabbing blonde bombshell, Julian Glover is the best of the Indiana Jones main villains, But the man steals the show is Michael Byrne as the Jones hating Colonel Vogel, who relishes in torturing Indy and his father. It's Spielberg's wide-eyed enthusiasm that turns The Last Crusade into the wildest and wittiest Indy of them all. His message is to stop searching for messages and join in the fun.",

            "content": "The Indiana Jones saga is very popular for action films today. I have seen all three of them on a recent date but never really thought about what makes them so good. When watching a movie in the theater or at home you don't realize certain techniques or qualities or characters that make it so appealing to people.In Indiana Jones the camera is used to show the point of view stressed in the movie. It is in third person and depicts the events of his life- from his growing up as a boy to being a man teaching classes to a school and still exploring as a man.When you think about characters from the movie, you have to start with the two most important roles: Indiana and his father. Indiana starts out as a young man trying to do what is right. He seems to grow into a man with priorities like his teaching career. He accepts a job to look for the Holy Grail almost trying to live up to his fathers glory, then he finds out his father is already on the same mission but missing. Indiana and his father have a rough relationship with each other. His father was not around much because of work when he was little so they're still trying to accept one another for who they really are. Indiana's father is different from Indiana in that he thinks before he acts and is almost more \"kind\" than Indiana. Their relationship grows throughout the movie, and it seems very real like a normal family would grow up. Most families do not have perfect relationships just like Indiana and his father, but they work it out to accept one another.Unlike some movies, The Last Crusade moves from past to present. It explains Indiana Jones in his boy hood years and how he grew into the hero he is today. He spends his time searching for the cross which leads its way into the present adventures and the search for the Holy Grail. It works out well because both enjoy going on adventures and this time they are working together- almost ironic since his father wasn't around when he was a boy. Besides searching for the Grail, I think they are searching for acceptance and a better relationship together. One of the final scenes in the movie shows Donovan shoot his father so Indiana would keep the quest for the Grail to save him.Throughout the movie Indiana Jones tries to live up to his father and his approval. You notice this because when searching for the Grail, no matter what he does Indiana cannot do anything right. Everything is made right by the end of the movie and there was realistic appeal because it sounded like a normal family and not just scripted.There are also technical parts of the movie that made it seem real and more enjoyable. The director uses cameras with different angles and changes views to see Indiana throughout his chases. Another technique was dim lighting and framed camera work to show mood, and what was made to think of certain places. The library is made to be creepy so the lighting was low and dim. Certain camera shots showed views that made is seem like you were really in Indiana's shoes, like when they showed the side mirror in one of the chases.Until now I never realized what actually went into a movie and not just acting. There are so many aspects that you don't appreciate when just watching a movie for entertainment. After critiquing a film you actually understand how much work and energy it took to complete a film like Indiana Jones. Although I'd rather just watch a movie for fun, it was interesting knowing the different techniques put into films.",

            "content": "This is the best and most underrated of the trilogy, hands down.My perspective may be a little skewed, because I actually saw the Indiana Jones movies in reverse order--\"Last Crusade\" was the first one I saw.  I think that put me in a better position to appreciate it than the '80s-jaded critics and \"Raiders\" fans who wrote off the third installment as an inferior imitation.I loved it.  Even after seeing \"Raiders\" (which I liked) and \"Temple of Doom\" (which I hated), the third still ranks the best in my book.  And why? Two reasons, which are intertwined:It's FUNNY--much more comic relief than either of the other two, which keeps the tone light and the pace brisk. (One exception: the scene when Donovan ends up bargaining with his Rolls Royce--lame & totally extraneous.) I actually thought that \"Raiders,\" not \"Crusade,\" dragged in parts--I know it's heresy to say so-- because it seemed like a never-ending chain of rather heavy tho' suspenseful action sequences, without any of the laughs that livened \"Crusade.\"  I still laugh out loud every time I watch number 3.Secondly it's funny mostly because of Sean Connery-  a stroke of casting genius.  He brings flair to the whole production, yet he doesn't hog the stage--he brings out the very best in Harrison Ford.  Those two have such a hilarious, wonderful rapport; just notice the -looks- they exchange on the motorcycle ride, every time Indy plows down another baddie.  Priceless.The relationship btw. \"Last Crusade\" and \"Raiders\" is in some ways similar to that btw. \"Return of the Jedi\" and \"Star Wars.\"  In both trilogies, the third installment recycles a lot of the material of the first, but tries to flesh out the characters and deepen our emotional connection to them.  The difference?  \"Last Crusade\" is a -way_-better movie than \"Jedi,\" and actually packs a surprising emotional heft in the last few scenes: I LOVE the moment when Dad (Connery) is reaching out to Indy and says for the first time, very quietly but oh so effectively, \"Indiana.\"  The Christian mysticism may feel slapped-on to some, but I actually liked it.  And I'm an agnostic.All in all, \"Last Crusade\" didn't feel at all stale or mechanical to me.  It felt like fresh, glorious entertainment--a total joy-ride with surprising depths, owing largely to Connery & Ford--and still feels fresh every time I go back to watch it.",

Imagine stumbling into the man at a Nazi rally in Berlin 1938 and giving him the prized possession half his army seeks, only to get an autograph back!! That's what I like about Spielberg in all his war-esque movies. He has a unique ability to show the Nazi as a human being and yet also to show them at their most barbaric during the 1940s, though I'll admit they are pretty much caricatured in Last Crusade. The plot is classic Indy Jones and though it may seem far fetched, remember that SS chief Heinrich Himmler did send soldiers and archaeologists all around the world to try and establish the myth of German racial and cultural superiority. And if there was a Christian artefact to be found out there, you can be sure Waffen-SS battalions would have been dispatchedThe humour overall is upgraded for a more modern time and Connery definetly adds another dimension to the film. Elliot is underused (he was a superb actor though in general) again but this film can be considered an eighties classic in my opinion.",

That's a McGuffin, integrated so well in a story, Hitchcock maybe would have wished to have a cameo in that movie. Well add very good baddies (the Germans were always reliable ones), effectively used action and suspense and a nice love-hate relationship between Indy and the bad girl and there you have a classic!

A classic example of a film that shines because it doesn't take itself too seriously; and uses that to hide some of its shortfalls.Visually the film is stunning. Colours still pop and location choices are some of the most beautiful in the world.With the exception of Sean Connery, the acting is suspect, but again perhaps by design.With the exception of the Turkish hats worn by Kazim and his crew, the wardrobe is very well done and appropriate.Bottom line and accounting for nostalgia, the film holds up just fine. I would have liked the puzzles throughout the movie to be more intricate and believable (Roman numerals??? ... Come on!), but that's a detail. Despite being dramatically over the top, the action sequences are entertaining and engaing. The score is obviously a classic and arguably still one of the best of all time.

River Phoenix really captures the mannerisms and facial expressions of Harrison Ford in this sequence.As for the rest of the movie, John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliott make welcome returns to the cast but the true strength of the film lies in Sean Connery's casting as Indy's father, Professor Henry Jones, Sr.  The scenes shared by Ford and Connery positively light up the screen with wit, and there's a definite (non-sexual!) screen chemistry about them.All-in-all, not quite as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark, but pretty close all the same.",

It is about Indiana Jones who goes off on a quest to find his father who has disappeared while looking for the Holy Grail. He ends up going through all the challenges to get to the Grail to save his fathers life because he was shot. The way that they plotted the movie was very well done. It took place in the 1930 while world war two was occurring. You know this because in one scene Indiana Jones comes face to face with the Nazi ruler Adolph Hitler. (The man who played hit fit in with the roll pretty well because he looked just like him). This setting fit well because it made it seem more adventurous to have a man against Nazi which no one likes. And it also made it seem more adventurous and daring because technology was not big then so they used older weapons and it just made the scene better. A big thing that was noticed is that whenever something was going wrong bad sounding music would play, but when Indiana started doing something good, for example, win a fight then the theme song would begin to play. The main purpose for the music was to set the mood of each scene. The theme of the movie that was discovered was the big feud between father and son. Indiana and his father were never really close and all that Indiana wanted was to make his father proud. And throughout the movie you notice that Indiana tries impressing his father but is never successful. And finally in the end of the movie when Indiana his hold on by one hand his father finally give Indiana what he wants. Over all this movie is very good and so is the other two and I have seen all of them many times and can watch them over and over again.",

            "content": "Kayla Marie Link: Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade was a very action packed motion picture. Indiana Jones was the main character played by Harrison Ford. The plot of this movie was that Indiana Jones, or \"Junior\" was trying to protect the Holy Grail from the evil men who were trying to get to it before Indiana or his father could reach it. It shows how Indiana Jones first comes acrossed his brown hat and whip that he always has with him when he is battling. They show men in black tuxedos with red flowers which was meant to represent evil. The movie starts off in Utah in 1912. It goes through the different years and different places like Portugese, and Venice, Italy. The story is told in third person point of view. They use sound to bring the movie together and set the different moods. They play the Indiana Jones theme song when he finds his whip and his hat that he has in all of the movies. They also use lighting in different ways to bring the movie together. When the men in the black tuxedos are on the screen the lighting is mostly dark. When they are on the plane they also show the shadow on the table that shows us that the plane is turning around. This movie is pretty good if your into action movies.",

One thing I like and maybe not everyone likes is that, this movie isn't strict action, it's fun too, so I laughed a lot.I think that the name should be The quest for the holy cup or something like that, not the Last crusade. But at that time they didn't know that they will make another movie. At least I think so.Harrison Ford is really one hell of an actor (my favorite one besides Gary Oldman) and with Sean Connery they make the best team ever. They both did their part really well. I think it couldn't be better.I especially like the scene when they meet Hitler and he signs the diary. He he. It sure scared a hell out of Indy. And one on the Zeppelin when Indy throws one german soldier overboard (\"No ticket\":)).I prefer this movie to everyone who loves action and history.

This film in nature is similar to the prequels but bases its story on another historical significant era in European history, The Crusade. This movie takes a difference approach in the sense that it integrates a more humorous aspect with a somewhat clash of a father son relationship, but nonetheless is nicely integrated with sufficient action packed confrontations with the typical Nazi villains. This film is a roller coaster ride on a journey of discovery for a lost artifact of history as well as the relationships between the characters, all mixed in with the wacky go lucky antics between Indiana Jones, his father and the Nazis.",

Dont think for one moment I don't like the film, but it's not as dark and realistic as it could have been, (especially with the two best actors ever in the lead).  Also as a separate point, the effects seem to have aged very quickly which is not the case with the first two, I cringe at the site of Indy and his dad in the plane, minus wind effects and surrounded by almost visible matte lines.

No matter what people say, there are links with Raiders e.g. Indy can easily confirm the identity of the Ark from the drawing underneath Venice.  Alright there are uncomfortable similarities between the two.  Nazis, religious treasure, fight on a moving vehicle...But the best part is the interaction between Connery and Ford.  They have a very convincing relationship on screen, and it is easy to imagine them as father and son.  The comedy in this film is fabulous.  The only thing is that if Indy's father is scottish, as is obvious, surely he'd be able to put on a better scottish accent than he did?The best joke comes at the end and involves a well loved dog.  This just tops off the film and the non stop ride it is and is a great example of the father-son relationship.  Whether this film is better than Raiders is difficult to say, for me i think they're both as good as each other.",

So what if the whip, the hat, the scar, etc, are all explained in a 10 minute sequence? I am sure *true* Indiana Jones fans really enjoyed that because it was like celebrating the hero. Who cares if it was unrealistic? This movie is not supposed to be about realism, it's supposed to be about fantasy and fun.#2 - The similarities with the original. Yes, there are a lot of them, but HELLO, if we take Indiana from his \"habitat\", he's not Indiana anymore. He's not fun anymore. Indiana has always been about ancient religious objects, and Nazis, and wrath-of-God, and so on.

There are many things this movie does better than the first movie, unbelievable as that is.This is probably the best paced movie I've ever seen in my life. It's structure is practically perfect. There's always something happening, and the story is always moving forward. I was almost shocked when I looked at the clock after what felt like 10 minutes and discovered that I was already halfway through the movie.I love the fact that the character of Marcus Brody plays such a central role in this movie. I think he's such and enjoyable character and Denholm Elliot did an impeccable job portraying him.Sean Connery plays Indiana Jones' dad in this film! Great, great, great casting! He's absolutely phenomenal in this role, and his chemistry with Ford is delightful. Definitely one of the best things about this film is seeing two of the greatest living action stars together on the screen. Bringing Indy's father into this movie was the wisest decision ever. It makes the story much more personal and intimate, and it gives Indiana Jones' character a great deal of depth.They also tried deepening Indy's character by telling us a bit about his early days... And that's probably the only thing I really don't like about this movie. The opening sequence with young Indy is great fun and all, but I feel like Indiana Jones is one of those characters who would be more interesting if we didn't know this part of his backstory. It just feels unnecessary to me. They could've just dropped this entire sequence and it wouldn't hurt the movie in any way - it would've made it better.But the rest of the movie is just awesome. So many memorable scenes and set-pieces, my favorite probably being the tank chase. My god, the tank chase! That sequence is so incredibly intense and awesome! Everything about the tank chase is perfect! It's just so well made! And of course, the entire part with the three trials and the recovery of the Holy Grail is brilliant.Oh, and this film has my favorite movie soundtrack, period.",

After stumbling upon a group of grave robbers, young Indiana (played with gusto by River Phoenix, who tragically died of a drug overdose in 1993 at the brink of a successful career) steals the valuable Cross of Coronado, with the intention of presenting it to a museum. As he scrambles desperately across the carriages of a moving circus train, in flight from his experienced pursuers, we come to witness the origin of some of the hero's trademarks: the fear of snakes, the bull-whip and, of course, the fedora hat.Returning to 1938, we find Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) as the clean-shaven, tweed-wearing professor at a New England college, lecturing to his students about the lack of adventure in the field of archeology (\"X never ever marks the spot\"). Following the disappearance of his father, respected archaeologist Prof. Henry Jones (Sean Connery), Indiana strikes off across the world in search of him, unwittingly throwing himself into a race to discover the Holy Grail, the sacred cup used by Jesus Christ at the Last Supper. However, to make matters worse, Indiana finds that his old enemies - the Nazis - have also launched a frantic bid to acquire the Grail. Aided by museum curator Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) and beautiful Austrian historian Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), Indiana must rescue his father, beat the bad guys and uncover the ultimate archaeological treasure.'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' was, once again, directed by Steven Spielberg, working off a story by George Lucas and Menno Meyjes, and a screenplay from Jeffrey Boam. What ultimately makes the film such an enjoyable ride is its fantastic sense of humour, and Connery's character delivers a large portion of the comedy, whether he is smashing his son over the head with a fake Ming Vase, setting the floor alight or blasting away the tail of his own plane with a machine gun (before blaming it on the Nazis). Ford and Connery have their own share of playful father-son banter, which becomes particularly farcical when it is revealed that they have both slept with the same woman (a favourite piece of dialogue: \"I'm as human as the next man\"; \"I was the next man!\"). Denholm Elliott is also highly entertaining as Marcus Brody, who, despite Indiana's great respect for him, is so hopelessly inept that he \"once got lost in his own museum.\"",

I first saw it when I was about 7 years old (I'm 17 now), and although I could not completely fathom it all at first, it still affected me.One of my favorite things about the film is the score. The score is wonderful and one of John Williams' best. It is not often hailed by his fans as one of his best, but I have always thought it does a wonderful job of capturing the spirit of the film. Everything from the pastoral Grail theme to the motorcycle scherzo to the great (!! my favorite !!) Nazi theme. This is what started such a love for music for me and I am forever grateful to Williams for being the author of a lifelong passion and possibly even a career.I owe my interest in music and my deep interest in film to this movie If you haven't seen this film, you have to soon.

            "content": "Brian M. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is truly a classic film that can provide enjoyment for all ages. I had seen the movie a few times prior but after watching it in an English class under the guidance of a critiquing packet given to us by our teacher I saw it in a new light. The technical aspects of this film are simply genius. With our teacher pointing out things like the rose that was present when the Nazi regime was present or close. It is not usual to notice these types of points when you just watch it with a bucket of popcorn. The music and other audio effects added so much to the tone and mood I was very impressed when I began to listen for it. How it matched the scenes and situations so well.The theme of the movie was spelled out as Indy continually tried to live up to his father's expectations while he tried not to care. As each struggle throughout the movie came up he proved himself over and over and no matter what he did, did not seem to please his father. It was not until Indy was able to retrieve his father's life long work of finding the grail was, in my opinion, he truly accepted by his father. At one point in the film we were eluded to his father's true feelings as they thought Indy was dead when he went down the tank.As the movie progresses the story develops introducing Indy as a boy scout when he started he passion for artifact retrieval. The desire for the grail was introduced by a Mr. Donovan. He seems to be a wealthy collector but as our teacher pointed out the rose on his jacket similar to the one the man with the cane had on his jacket when they stole back the cross at the beginning of the movie. Once the journey began he was first confronted by Ms. Schied. (Hey! She had a rose too!) After making progression towards the grail another group that protects the frail attacks them, the same group that ends us up protecting them through the film. As we go through the adventure we constantly notice the tone that Indy and his father have between them isn't exactly warm and fuzzy. Indy through a b plot arises. He is constantly trying to prove himself and \"graduate,\" from his father's new of Indy being \"Junia.\" Once they are captured they begin to talk about what was going on between them. Once the grail was just through just thought the tests of faith the camera uses Juxtaposition. As Indy coaches himself through the tests his father is doing the same. And I refuse to tell you anymore than that, watch the movie to find out what happens.After watching the whole movie I could only hope that it would never end or there were more to come. I found such a new appreciation for the film's creativeness and uniqueness that I am sad to have missed before. This will always be a timeless classic of comparison and envy to those that cannot capture its greatness.",

            "content": "Spencer Dye The movie, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, is very popular among all age groups. This is true about the rest of the Indiana Jones movies, such as The Temple of Doom and The Raiders of the Lost Arc. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade begins in the state of Utah in the year 1912. Indiana Jones is just a young boy. The movie then shifts from 1912 to 1938. It is scripted as a third person point of view. The characters in the movie seem very real to the viewer that is watching. This is a very important part of a movie. Between friendships, family, and enemies the characters interact in a very realistic way. Indiana Jones and his father interact like any other normal father and son would. Most all fathers and sons have their arguments and times when they don't get along. Indiana Jones and his father don't get along throughout the first portion of the movie. This brings a raising conflict between the two that is built up through the movie. Indiana Jones tells his father that they don't have a very good relationship between the two of them and that his father doesn't pay any attention to him. His father responds saying that he was only respecting his privacy. Jumping to the end of the movie, the conflict ends between Indiana Jones and his father when he saved his father from a gunshot wound. The characters that are enemies of Indiana and his father seem very realistic to the viewer as well. Through fight scenes and arguments it is very evident that the enemies dislike Indiana Jones and his father. There are many different settings in this movie. It starts out in Utah and changes throughout the movie. The setting is in America, Italy, and a few other countries also. They are in search for the cup of Christ or the Holy Grail. Some of the different lighting, sounds, and camera techniques that are used in the movie play a very important part in many different scenes. Some of the special lighting that was used were shadows. This is the scene when Indiana Jones and his father are on the zeppelin traveling out of Germany. The shadow that is reflected off the table starts to spin showing the viewer that they're turning around. They're taking Indiana Jones and his father back to Germany where the Nazis will be waiting for them. Also, another lighting technique that is used is the bright light that shines down on Indiana's father when he approaches death near the end of the movie. Some of the sounds that were used gave another effect to the movie. A man stamps his books in a library and at the same time of the stamp Indiana slams the floor with a metal rail holder. The man can not see Indiana and think that his stamp is making the loud noise on the books as he stamps. Indiana's famous theme song that is played when something good happens or something good is about to happen is another aspect of sound in the movie. An important camera technique that is used is rack focus. Rack focus is a zoom that focuses on something close and turns the background blurry and then it switches. This is used on the man with the white suit. This movie uses very interesting camera techniques, sounds, lighting, and characters that interact well with each other. They seem very realistic to the viewer. Critiquing this film was a fun experience because there were so many different action pact scenes.",

            "content": "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the third chapter in the Indiana Jones phenomenon. Staring Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, this movie never stops with action. The opening scene of Indiana as a boy stumbling on bad guys finding a long lost travel sets the tone of the movie and at what kind of pace the movie will be in. The setting for most of the movie was in Portuguese and Venice in the early 1910's. The setting plays an important role in the story line because this is the kind of terrain that Indiana works best with, the sand, mountains and somewhat plains of Eastern Europe. In scene of looking back to when Indiana was a child, it shows where he gets the famous whip and hat. Spielberg did a great job of going back in time to show the viewer how Indiana acquired his two signatures. The movie is set in third person point of view as Indiana attempts to find the Holy Grail. The Holy Grail is the cup in which Jesus Christ drank from during his last supper. It is said that he who drinks from this cup should have eternal youth. In this third movie, we meet Indiana's father, played by Sean Connery, Professor Henry Jones. Connery plays the father very well and he seems like a realistic character due in part in his way to never warn Indiana about danger, but he is seen as a older pal who lacks three dimensions because children are unable to see their parents in that difficulty. The theme of the movie obviously is how Indiana and his father communicate and react to each other and how Indiana is trying to live up to his father. Connery, it looks like, has a lot of fun with his role, and it is obvious to see that he pans well with Ford as his father.Spielberg put some nice touches on the film's technical elements in this movie. He has definitely proved himself as an elite film maker after this movie. He uses the caves scenes to his advantage by using darkness and shadows to make the viewer feel like they are there with Indiana and that something could happen at any moment. When Indiana is on the ship heading over, you can really feel like you are on the boat with him due to the lightning, waves and mist being all around him, you feel like something could actually happen to you. The music during the action scenes put you on the edge of your seat each time you hear it, and the suspenseful music at the beginning of the movie set the tone for the suspense that would follow in the movie. This was present throughout the movie in different ways to show the drama and excitement of the scenes. The way that Spielberg used silhouettes in the cave scenes was brilliant. The rack-focus technique was used during the whip scene in the beginning of the movie when Indiana is in the train car with the lion. The shadows to show the bad guys was a great way to use lighting as a way to use camera techniques to his advantage and add a certain suspense to who the characters were. Overall, this movie is a must see and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a action movie, with slight comedy relief.",

The third and final movie, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, proves to be the best. It has stood the tests of time and come out on top in the movie world. It plays a crucial role, in that it is the final movie. It holds the shoulders of the other two movies and is very pivotal in putting the final ending on a great series of movies.We had to watch this movie, so we could do a movie critique at the end. After watching the movie, listening to a critique and reviewing a critique worksheet, I have received a different understanding of movies altogether. I realized how much more information and how many different aspects of a movie there really are. Indiana Jones, is know different, it is full with all of this interesting information, sitting there waiting to be plucked out.The whole movie is shot from a third person point of view. The director, Steven Spielberg, uses the camera as the narrator. He does this to show the audience what he wants them to see. In this way, the film becomes different than the original book. The setting of the story, takes place in a few different places. They start off in Utah in the nineteen hundreds, and then we slowly progressive to multiple different locations, until we arrive at are final destination, the Holy Grail. The whole purpose of the quest was to find the grail and put it into a museum where everyone could enjoy it. To figure out the time period of the movie, you could use different clues such as clothing style. You notice that the clothes the characters are wearing resemble that of someone from the 1920's. That is exactly what Spielberg wanted to do, show you the date, not tell it to you directly. Towards the end of the film, you could use clues to figure out there location. You can easily tell this, when you see lots of camels, and vast amounts of dessert surrounding them.The two main characters of the film, are Henry Jones (Sean Connery), is the father of Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) and they are both on the quest to find the grail. The whole journey starts, when Indiana finds out his dad was kidnapped because his diary contained the clues to find the grail. Throughout the movie, the plot becomes ever present. Indiana Jones, or Jr. as he is commonly referred to, has spent his whole life trying to live up to his fathers expectations. Henry, his father, seems to think that his son has never accomplished anything big enough, or important enough. Indiana is constantly striving for attention, and this leads to numerous arguments between the two. By the end of the movie, they have reached a climax with their fighting, and finally end it, when Henry is trying to save his son from falling in a crevice.Many technical elements were used to help enhance the viewing of the movie. Even though this movie was shot some fifteen to twenty years ago, the way they splice the scenes and add special effects is amazing. Towards the end of the movie, Spielberg uses a camera technique called juxtaposistion. This technique involves showing one character doing one thing, then switching over to show another character doing the same thing. When Indiana is trying to reach the grail, and is reciting the clues to get in, the shot will switch, and show his father saying the same things. It really gives you a different viewing experience, and adds a little extra something to the movie. The sound also plays a huge role, since every time something big and important comes up, or Indiana gets into trouble, his theme song plays. This helps the viewer realize what's going on, and draws you in and keeps you hanging on. This was truly one of the greatest movies ever, and by critiquing it, it opened my eyes to a whole new world of movie viewing.",

In the very beginning of the movie we start off by seeing desert and hearing eerie music. This leads us into a cave where we meet the young Indiana Jones. The use of lighting on the rock sculptures and echoing in the caves is a good use of those techniques. Throughout the rest of the movie we go through Venice and Vienna which is on the Germany Austria border. We see the similar kind of environment as when Indiana was in the desert. Throughout the entire movie we see a pattern that relates his past to his present. Such as him dad calling him Junior, and seeing how he got his famous whip and hat. ) The whip was introduced to us by using an interesting film technique called rack focus.) Both involve thinking back to when he was younger (flashback). The point of view in this movie is set up in third person. Therefore were being told how a story of someone's adventure or life is happening. Throughout the movie the entire plot is to find the Holy Grail, which is the glass that Jesus drank from at the last supper. It's said that if you drink from it you will have eternal life, but only if you don't cross the seal. The lighting in the chamber with all the different cups is really interesting. By using the lightness, darkness and shadows, you get the effect of realism. It makes' you think you're really there with him in the movie. This is key to being a good film maker. As for the Holy Grail cups, there are shiny gold ones which the light reflects off of and one ugly wooden one. One of the main themes of the movie is how the hero always rides off into the sunset at the end of the movie. This has been done in a lot of movie, especially Westerns. This shows us that at the end of the day they end come out on top of the world and that he had won in all of his conquests throughout his adventure. I especially like this shot because in a way is very classical. During this the music is happy and cheerful, and light. It some-what lifts you up because everyone is happy that good prevailed over evil and now no wrong can be done. It gives you a sense that you're safe, again going back to realism.",

Indy's father, Dr. Jones, is beautifully played by Sean Connery. Mr. Connery brings that fatherly image perfectly to the screen.

At this time, the Nazis are after Indiana Jones' Father, Professor Henry Jones, for his little diary that contains maps to an object that is wanted by both parties, the Holy Grail of Jesus Christ. Meanwhile, Indiana Jones tries to help his father to find the Holy Grail, in which his father has spent many years trying to find. The Nazis learn of this, and come after and kidnap Henry Jones, in their hopes to find the Holy Grail themselves. Indiana sets out in hope to find his father, who is now missing, but when Indiana Jones receives the diary in the mail, he sets out himself to fulfill his fathers' dream of finding the Grail. With the help of Dr. Marcus Brody, he sets off to the temple at Alexandetta , where the Grail is supposedly located.Throughout the movie, you cant help but notice how much Indiana Jones' father disagrees with him, or doesn't approve of anything that he does. When Indiana saves his father from being killed, his father just shakes his head, and makes us believe that he still isn't happy with Indiana. For the most part, this movie is told from Indiana Jones' point of view. The movie even starts off showing how symbolic it is that he uses his whip. You also probably know the Indiana Jones' theme song, which is played a few times throughout this movie. Steven Spielberg does an awesome job with using the camera to use Panning, and Zooming in and out of scene. He also uses lighting to indicate that if Indiana doesn't hurry up to find the Holy Grail at the temple, then his father will die. His father can only be saved by the healing power of the Holy Grail of Jesus Christ. If you want to find out what happens at the end, I recommend that you watch the movie. Its worth your time!!!!",

The main characters in the Last Crusade are Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), and Henry Jones (Sean Connery). The director Steven Spielberg found a great actor in Connery to play Indiana's father because they just work so well together.The whole plot of the movie was a quest to search for the Holy Grail (the most prized artifact in the world) and keep it from getting into the hands of the Nazis. The setting of the movie in the beginning took place in Utah around 1912, then it switches to Venice, Italy, and then moves to various locations in Europe, and it finally ends in Alexandretta, where they find the Holy Grail. The theme to this movie would have to be good vs. evil, Henry and Indiana Jones against the Nazis.This movie was shot from first person point of view because it showed you what the actor saw. The camera techniques were great they showed juxtaposition, and panning, it made you seem as though you were there. The sound played a crucial role in this movie because when something exciting was going to happen the music gets loader to draw your attention and when something good is happening to Indiana Jones his famous theme song begins to play.

Indiana must then make his way directly into Germany in order to save his father, his diary, and the Holy Grail. This story was told in 3rd person, the setting was established by superimposed images such as; Utah 1912. The movie had a good use of sound to tell the story, such as high tempo for the cave chase and when something important happened they would play Indiana Jone's theme song. Indiana was always seen with his hat and whip during his fighting scenes. It was also very sad music when hes going ingot the temple at Alexandetta. The use of lighting also helped tell the story, the use of black and red (flower) showed when the enemies came. The use of light over his father when he was dieing also showed that he was going to die if Indiana didn't hurry. They used to light to portray heaven.

It kinda love the trilogy equally so I love this film just as much as Raiders and Doom. What I really like about it is that it feels like one big race to the Holy Grail between indy accompanied with his father and the nazis. It has the feeling of Raiders but not a rehash, everything is just top tier filmmaking. The action sequences are really good and the ending feels so earned and ended the trilogy in a perfect way I can't see it being done better. From beginning to end just perfect I wouldn't argue if it was you're favorite out of the films.",

It follows the typical Indiana Jones formula. \n\nI like how the movie opens up and shows us Indy as a young man. This was obviously done to set up the story, amongst other things. \n\nEven though it isn't my favorite Indy film, I think it has the best quest. It's not very intense, and I would dare say mild, but the story is great. We actually got two adventures in this film. The mission to find the father, and the quest for the Holy Grail. \n\nI could've done without the character of Elsa Schneider. The fact that she seduced, both father and son, was extremely disgusting to me. \n\nMy favorite scene was definitely when they were captured in the house and this led to the motorcycle chase. The way they escaped was fun to watch, and seeing Indy navigate the motorcycle with a sidecar was cool. \n\nCome to think about it, I might like this film more than I thought. I'll rewatch the entire series later on in the year and review again. \n\nDo I recommend this? Of course I do, it's Indiana Jones silly.\n\nThis gets a LennyReviewz Score of: 6/10",

Throw in the charming Professor Jones Sr. (Sean Connery) to spice things up a bit and you're left with an exciting, if not totally original, action adventure that sticks to the original winning formula and proves to be a lot of fun.  This time around, Indiana is in search of the Holy Grail instead of the Lost Ark, but everything else, with the exception of the exotic locales, remains pretty much the same.

He went missing in pursuit of his life's passion project: locating the fabled Holy Grail.  Will Indiana be able to pick up his trail?  Now I have always considered this to be my favorite Indiana Jones movie.  Not to take anything away from Raiders, which was inarguably a game changer, but Last Crusade always spoke to me more.  I'm slowly making my way through the entire series as I find spare time on the weekends, and yeah, I still feel the same way after all these years.  There is just so much to love about this movie.  Yes, it exceeds a two-hour mark when you keep the end credits, but it is all gravy in my book.  You could probably cut the opening where you get to see young Indiana as portrayed by the late River Phoenix if you really had to, but I love it because it functions as a standalone mini-movie in addition to showing the restrained relationship Indy had with his father growing up.  You can watch it by itself and still get that adventure itch scratched in the way that only Indiana Jones can do.  The rest of the movie all fits together with that same fluidity, and scenes flow effortlessly into the next one.  I feel like they recognized what was successful from the previous two films and leaned into what works, especially with the comedy.  There are off-handed one-liners galore in this, and they will almost always get a big belly laugh out of me.  I'm sure this movie in particular was a huge inspiration to the Uncharted video game series; Indiana Jones was always the goal for that video game, but the laugh-action balance is completely in step with this chapter right here.  As far as notes go, I don't have much.  Sean Connery brings a wonderful dynamic to the story, and not only that, but everything about the character also makes you further understand why Indiana is the way that he is in the previous movies you have already seen.  It takes a special kind of sequel to improve the films that precede it, and Last Crusade is absolutely up to the challenge.",

The action is epic, and I liked the neat sequence at the beginning that explains things such as Indy's fear of snakes and how he got the scar on his chin. Steven Spielburg does an excellent job directing, while both Harrison Ford and Sean Connery(in a masterstroke of casting) are perfectly cast as Indy and Indy's father.

The script is deliciously witty especially with the interplay between Ford and Connery, and the story is engaging. The action is epic, and I liked the neat sequence at the beginning that explains things such as Indy's fear of snakes and how he got the scar on his chin. Steven Spielburg does an excellent job directing, while both Harrison Ford and Sean Connery(in a masterstroke of casting) are perfectly cast as Indy and Indy's father. On the whole, exciting, witty and fun. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

It looks and sounds just as great as the first two movies, has the same blend of action, worldbuilding and humor, and in some ways it surpasses the other two in these respects.  Additionally, the introduction of Sean Connery as Indiana Jones' father was a brilliant move, and the fact that he's a well-realized and immensely flawed character, yet likable nonetheless, only serves to add to the movie's strengths.  Throw in a more versatile change of landscapes from Act to Act, some fantastic adrenaline rush moments and a surprisingly thoughtful and emotional climax, and you've got a movie that is a genuinely excellent work of cinema on its own merits, even without taking the first two into account.  It works as both a popcorn-munching Blockbuster level, and it works as more of a \"thinking man's\" movie as well, and it works brilliantly as both.",

Wait a minute... they were both good. This is the essence of Spielberg's 1982 classic. All that is sacrificed or added is always just... awesome. It's an awesome movie in general, and has stood the test of 4 decades with effortless bravura. It's a must watch for all the family. Trust me. I mean it. Watch it.

It almost is just a highlight of the ridiculous lengths that Nazi's went to look for weird resources: the occult (\"Hellboy\"), artifacts, and investigations into alien contact.\n\nThis is a return to quality though, it takes up the more serious atmosphere of the first movie and with that concentrates on a dramatically good action adventure movie.\n\nThis is my favorite of the franchise.",

Ford and Connery are excellent together, raising the film's pedigree whilst also adding better humour. Even away from those two, the cast is a marked improvement as we see John Rhys-Davies return alongside newcomer Julian Glover.\n\nThe plot is still the weaker part of Indiana Jones, at least to me. I wasn't really interested in the objective of The Last Crusade, not that I was bored but I wasn't overly engrossed; just like with 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'.\n\nThere's still a lot of good to this though, particularly with John Williams' music once more. It has been a consistent if underwhelming trilogy so far, yet I'm still intrigued to see what 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' brings to the table.",

Steven Spielberg's 20th masterpiece (they're all masterpieces in my eye) constantly delivers punchy lines, tricky scenarios, and general hilarious-ness (it features Hitler giving out autographs!)\n\nBeginning with Junior's backstory in the sandy desert of Utah (portrayed by fellow charming scoundrel River Phoenix), we learn how Indy got the scar, the Fedora and Ophidiophobia (fear of snakes\u2014 duh).\n\nIt's a movie with perfect narrative and lots of talking (similar to a 007 film), with a climax as long and action-packed as all the others, leaving viewers boggling their eyes out for at least ten minutes.\n\nI might add that a movie centered almost entirely on The Holy Grail is not your average Spielberg-ian flick. It delves deep into the concept of \"belief\" and putting one's trust (and life) in the lord's hands. But does it work? Of course it does! Its Steven directing, how could it not?\n\nSo, with Harrison following the clues alongside Nazi spy Elsa Schneider, colleague Marcus Brody and, eventually, Sean Connery (who makes a very \"unexpected\" first appearance), we face off against the movie industry's favourite (and franchise's original) foe: Nazis. Featuring is Michael Byrne (aka Grindelwald in Deathly Hallows P1), a man, it seems, who's been in just about every Nazi movie ever (with more than a third of his acting credits either German, Russian, or army-related! \u2014 they're probably all bad guys).\n\nAnd alongside him is double-crosser Donovan, acted by Julian Glover; an actor with an equally prolific career, ranging from Bond villain Aristotle Kristatos and Star Wars General Maximilian Veers, to Aragog in The Chamber of Secrets (yup, they're both in Harry Potter! Huh, not much of a range then\u2014 just bad guys!\n\nThe one problem I have with this movie is it's high level of predictability and gullibility*, Indiana's character seems all too credulous (although it is tough to tell whether your German girl-friend is about to get shot or is actually a Nazi and acting as bait). I guess the biggest problem with me was knowing Walter Donovan was evil from the very start. Could've made that a bit less obvious.\n\nApart from that, the film was fabulous; keeping original while staying in tune with the other two.

And while it is not as good as the original Raiders of the Lost Ark, it is far better than the other two [soon to be three] in the series. I found that with the fifth installment of the Indiana Jones series coming up next year, I should re-watch the first four. If you have read my reviews for them [which you probably haven't], you will find that I gave Raiders a 5/5 and Temple a 3.5/5, and I'm still trying my hardest to avoid the carnage known as Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Now, if you haven't noticed, I have given the Last Crusade a 5/5. Why, you may ask? Because, just like the first one, it is funny and thrilling, and very original. The original Jones movie featured a standard plot, guy vs Nazis with love interest. It sounds lame, but it works incredibly well. For the second one, they didn't have any fresh ideas; just turn the Nazis into some Indian cult. Last Crusade keeps the Nazis, which, if I'm going to be honest, prefer over the Indian culture with an underground Nike sweatshop. However, it twists the romance side plot, and adds Indiana Jones' dad. Now THAT is awesome. Sean Connery and Harrison Ford clearly have nice chemistry in this film, making it funny in between all the action sequences, which, despite outdated special effects, are still awesome. [Which is another reason I didn't like Temple, the action sequences are super lame, but you should probably just read my review instead.] If you enjoyed the first one, I suggest you watch this one. It is almost as awesome as the first.",

This movie is also infinitely funnier than both of it\u2019s predecessors. What a great conclusion to this badass trilogy. ",

Everything that I loved about Raiders of the Lost Ark came back, and everything I hated about Temple of Doom disappeared.\n\nThe chemistry between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery is hard to match. There are heartfelt moments, but there are more moments of hilarious interaction. The scene where the Order of the Cruciformed Sword attack the Nazis and Indy's father exclaims, 'Now who are all these people!?' will always make me laugh.\n\nThere is action and adventure aplenty in The Last Crusade. The entire tank sequence, in particular, is such a memorable setting and scene.\n\nDespite my overwhelming praise, The Last Crusade is far from a perfect film. Sure there are plot holes, and Indiana suffers from the \"immortal hero\" syndrome. Alison Doody's acting is questionable at times, but nothing compared to the atrocity that was Kate Capshaw in Temple of Doom.\n\nThere is a theme of Indiana's reluctance to believe in the supernatural, despite being proven wrong time and again, that really comes to light when you watch all three movies back to back. By the finale of The Last Crusade, Indy has become a believer.\n\nThe worst part of The Last Crusade is watching our heroes ride off into the sunset, knowing that no other adventure movie will fill the immense void left by Indiana Jones.",

We see a young Indiana Jones, played perfectly in character by River Phoenix, at the start of his adventures. All the way to Indiana Jones, played heroically and hilariously by Harrison Ford, through to his most religious quest yet as he searches for The Holy Grail. \n\nThematically, we witness Indiana struggle to find his faith as he once again must wrestle between science and religion. Additionally, Indiana must come to terms with his father Dr. Henry Jones Sr., played wonderfully by the ever delightful Sean Connery. Furthermore, Indiana has to pick from greed, glory, lust, or family. In regards to lust, Indiana wants love in the character of Dr. Elsa Schneider played by the sultry Alison Doody. Doody is not only gorgeous, but a cruel femme fatale and foil for Ford act opposite.\n\nConcerning Spielberg's direction, Spielberg masterfully takes the audience from one thrilling action set piece to another. Every location around the world is a ton of fun. The action, fights, and dialogue is as good as this series gets. All Spielberg's clever framing, lovely vistas, long panning shots, and realistic set design is on point. The Last Crusade is Spielberg at his creative peak.\n\nMusically, John Williams brings his classic score for Indiana Jones to life anew with his latest version of the theme. Adventure and mysterious are complemented by Williams' score in its wispy hymns.\n\nOverall, Spielberg should have ended the entire Indiana Jones franchise in 1989 with The Last Crusade on a massive high note. This movie is still exhilarating, engaging, and hilarious. You should certainly watch the Indiana Jones trilogy, but stop there and do not bother with Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Give The Last Crusade a chance and it will not disappoint!",

            "content": "After two successful big-budget starring vehicles, we finally get an origin story for Indiana Jones. Of course, that's largely to facilitate the addition of a new supporting character (Sean Connery in a wonderful casting as Indy's long lost father, who we'll get to in just a moment) but that extra layer of nostalgia, wrapped around a property that's deeply nostalgic in the first place, manages to avoid numerous pitfalls and serve as an effective prologue. River Phoenix performs especially well as the young Jones, expertly wearing Harrison Ford's mannerisms throughout the long callback, and somewhere along the way we get a worthwhile genesis for the grown-up version's affinity for leather jackets and fedoras.\n\nOnce the story jumps ahead to a more familiar era (if not precisely the present), it's full speed ahead on the hunt for the mythical holy grail, a lifelong obsession for the father and recent fixation of the third reich. Soon reunited, both Jones boys dance through precarious situations and near-misses in the history books, a full battalion of Nazi soldiers nipping at their heels, before drawing close to the prize. Ford and Connery are dynamic together, boiling down a complicated father-son relationship to a series of glares, grins and grunts. They alternate between bickering testily and slapping each other on the back in camaraderie, and I honestly can't say which makes for a more entertaining watch. There's depth, too, a stinging blend of long-simmering resentment and earnest care for one another, which often bubbles up just in time to enhance the plot's heaviest moments.\n\nNaturally, it simply wouldn't be an Indiana Jones movie without big action sets (in which the series somehow manages to one-up itself yet again) or boatloads of witty retorts and punchy one-liners, and those two essential elements combine to give the film a loose, fun-loving quality without compromising any of the more serious moments. All this without going too far over the top, as we saw more than once in the mildly underwhelming Temple of Doom and borderline-disastrous Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. It's well-written and purposeful, successfully intense and humorous, an in-the-wheelhouse serial-styled adventure that spans several continents before confronting superstition and cracking several dusty, life-threatening riddles on the path to a biblical treasure. Indy probably should've left well-enough alone, because this chapter is essentially impossible to top.",

            "content": "Adjust your fedoras and crack your whip with excitement at this third film in the Indiana Jones series. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is an important film for the industry. With this movie, we are reminded that an already well-rounded franchise can still surprise audiences and get \"bigger and better.\" While not being a trilogy in a traditional sense (one continuous story told in three films), each film in the series is interwoven with one another in multiple ways, despite being, for the most part, independent of each other (you do not need to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark to understand everything about the other two original movies). Continuing themes in the films are what help to hold them together; score and characters appearing in more than one film help with the all-around coherence of all three films. While still keeping the films mostly independent from each other, the occasional reference backwards in the series reminds viewers that this is the same world. Through the colorful cast, vibrant music, and comically wholesome story, we are taken once again into the pre-World War II life of Indiana Jones.\n\nOne of the incredible things that is always taken out of films is the score. John Williams returns to compose the film's musical stylings. With this job comes one of the most recognizable themes in film history. The march that accompanies Indiana Jones all around the world is iconic for all film enthusiasts, and even most people who have never seen any of the films. In this third iteration, Williams creates more masterfully written pieces that add a level of depth that only this composer can accomplish. Adventurous at one moment, and mysteriously grandiose the next. His music also conveys character emotion in ways that some other musicians only dream of, and this relationship is shown explicitly with the cast of the movie.\n\nAt the forefront of the movie, as well as the whole series, Harrison Ford portrays the charismatic and charming titular Indiana Jones. While the appearance of his \"typical\" female companion (played by Alison Doody) is welcome and expected in this feature, this is not the character dynamic that defines this movie. Sean Connery's portrayal of Henry Jones, Senior (Indy's father) makes this film stand out, as their dynamic carries the plot in a new way that the series had not attempted in the past. Other stars include returning Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies as Marcus Brody and Sallah, respectively from Raiders. These characters help to bring familiarity to the film as well as providing suitable \"bookends\" to the series as they both appeared in the first and third films.\nFrom a character standpoint, the villainous characters leave some things to be desired. The main villain played by Julian Glover could have played a larger role in the movie, but since his presence is not the main point of the film, his not perfect character is just bad enough to be believable, but is a footnote compared to the villains of the previous two films. \n\nSome of the film aspects that critics say is that it is too similar to the original film. While some very general things can be considered the same, it is the expansions that are made to the series that allows for a much more interesting experience. The action is on par or better than the other two films, or at the very least has higher stakes for the characters involved. The plot moves forward by this action, as well as the characters' interactions with each other. Indy and his father both change for the better in the movie; they learn to respect each other and repair their relationship after years of separation; It is through this bond that ensures these first three movies have a satisfying conclusion.",

It's rich because it's a trip, like several movies in one, with definitely enough action, places and situations for several.

Good news, they got rid of Spielberg's wife and Indy's Chinese kid sidekick in this one. I definitely find this to be the funniest out of the three with Sean Connery's hilarious performance along with a father-like feel to Harrison Ford, who once again does another great job as Indy. The action sequences are as fun as always and there are humorous moments every now and then to lighten the tension. I doubt I'll ever see anything funnier in this franchise than Indy posing as a ticket checker and throwing a Nazi officer looking for the Joneses and after saying \"no ticket\" scares everyone into presenting their tickets.  Hilarious. The Last Crusade: one of the best movie sequels ever made  and one of my favourite Spielberg movies of all time.",

Sean Connery really is so good as Indiana's father that you can actualy see him being his father in real life. Just like the first 2 films in the franchise it has everything you have come to expect from an Indiana film. I also love that we get to see a small taste of our hero's childhood. It follows the exact same formula as the first 2 but that's what makes a successful franchise. Some of the old favourite characters return and join in on the adventure which was a refreshing change. With this film Spielberg and Lucas insured that they created a truly successful trilogy of films that could even rival Star Wars. I would go so far as to say that in some ways Indiana Jones is a stronger trilogy than the first Star Wars trilogy simply because with this film Indiana realy does end on a strong note.",

There's a touching father-son bond throughout that blends so well against the greater scale story.\n\nOne of this film's biggest attributes is the supporting characters. Unlike Temple's characters who mainly ranged from annoying to forgettable (save Amrish Puri as Mola Ram), Crusade brings us a welcome mix of old friends (the always wonderful John Rhys-Davies as Sallah and Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody) and new (Sean Connery as Henry Sr. and Alison Doody as Elsa Schneider). Whereas Willie Scott and Short Round were such extreme character types that it was difficult to sympathize with them, Elsa and Henry are far more toned down but not without likable personalities.\n\nIf I had any complaints, the opening with young Indy feels a bit rushed and ridiculous, even for this sort of movie. The fact that all of his personality quirks and physical scars came about in the span of ten minutes is pretty hard to believe.\n\nStill, that's a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things. The Last Crusade is an excellent adventure film and a fond farewell to the Indiana Jones franchise. Well, at least for now.",

            "content": "Before even the days of \"Raiders Of The Ark\", Spielberg had expressed an interest in making a James Bond movie but he couldn't get the go-ahead from Bond producer Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli. Indy was just as good an opportunity for him, though, and who better to cast as Indy's father than (the original) James Bond himself? It's actually through the casting choice of Sean Connery that this third instalment of Indy's adventures really takes flight and silences the critics of \"The Temple Of Doom\".\n\nIn his third outing, Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) goes in search of his father, Prof. Henry Jones Sr (Sean Connery) who mysteriously disappeared while searching for the Holy Grail. Once again, though, the Nazi's are also in tow. After losing on the Ark of the Covenant, they too want to get their hands on the Cup of Christ.\n\nBy the time of this films release everybody was fully aware of Indiana Jones. With only two films under his fedora, every woman wanted him and every man wanted to be him; Indy had already become an icon of American cinema. With a fond familiarity, people welcomed him into their homes and that's the very reason why the opening of this third instalment is such a joy. It's depiction of Indy in his youth is wonderful addition to his backstory and the late great River Phoenix does an excellent job in capturing Ford's mannerisms. We learn of his use of the whip and the resulting scar on his chin. We also get an insight into the procurement of his famous fedora and how his unusual name of \"Indiana\" originated from the family dog... (It was actually George Lucas' dog that was named Indiana and it also served as the inspiration for Chewbacca in \"Star Wars\").\n\nAfter being heavily criticised for his dark tone in \"Temple of Doom\", Spielberg finds his lighter side again and delivers the funniest and most gleefully entertaining of Indy's adventures. The likes of Denholm Elliott and John Rhys Davies return from Raiders with more fleshed out comical roles but, as mentioned, it's the great interplay between Ford and Connery that's the biggest draw to here. The chemistry between them anchors a poignant family adventure while providing numerous father/son comedic moments.\n\nLike the previous two, though, there's no shortest of nail-biting action as World War II is on the brink and the Nazi's are once again Indy's foes and gives Spielberg another chance to put the Third Reich to the test. \"Schindler's List\" and \"Saving Private Ryan\" are obviously his more personal films on the subject but with Indy he gets the chance to have fun with them again, leaving this third instalment with more in common with \"Raiders\" as well as honing in on the biblical aspects of the story. Out goes the Ark and in comes the coveted Holy Grail and while the fourth film in the franchise - \"The Kingdom Of The Crystal\" - explores a misjudged science-fiction element, it confirms that Indy's adventures are better left in the paths of the religious or the occult.\n\nRaiders may still be the absolute classic of them all but it's hard to give a film with as much excitement and entertainment as this, anything less than top marks.\n\nMark Walker",

            "content": "Though Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was a step down for the series, I always remembered Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade as being a great finale for the trilogy and jumped at the chance to look back on it again.\n\nWith the film intro depicting beautiful shots of the Utah landscape, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade immediately establishes that it is going back to the roots of Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark by adopting a Western visual style which is very reminiscent of countless works by John Ford. This intro serves as an effective background piece for characterizing Indiana Jones before it changes. The story in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade steps it up since the last film by going back to the roots of exploring religious mythology in the context of a fun adventure film, exploring its themes with creativity and better characterization. The adventure this time sees Indiana Jones teamed up with his father who is able to bring both emotional value to the story and comedic value which is beyond the juvenile nature of its predecessor while also transcending the overdone damsel in distress trope which has already been explored twice in the series and was worn to death by Wilhelmina \"Willie\" Scott's incessant ramblings in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. The dark themes of that film are replaced by a more big scale adventure which is surprisingly ripe with grit this time around.\nMany scenes in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade depict the series going in a different angle, in particular the notable boat chase scene. While certain moments in this still mirror scenes from Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, it adopts a more contemporary spy thriller concept reminiscent of James Bond, ensuring that exhilarating action is brought into play in a manner new to the series and appealing to modern audiences. However, the key focus eventually proves itself to be a more war-themed concept. The return of Nazis to the film does not seem repetitive as this time the film takes an approach more familiar of John Sturges' 1963 war epic The Great Escape all while maintaining the same adventure serial theme, and later on it even goes along the angles of Howard Hughes' 1930 war blockbuster Hell's Angels. The debt that Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade owes to great war films is explored with exceptional action sequences on an all new scale for the series. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade has the most technologically impressive action of the trilogy. The stunts in the film are exceptionally impressive in terms of creativity and genuine technical value, as well as the fact that they are extremely intense which benefits the atmosphere greatly. Yet at the same time, they integrate humour into the experience very nicely. As well as being high quality, the general quantity of action in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is at a new level of impressive for the series. The production values of the film in general are excellent due to the western scenery as well as the timely props and costumes, as well as the impressive visual and sound effects. Everything is captured with beautifully atmospheric cinematography as well, and the musical score is once again brilliant. While maintaining the same lighthearted charm and iconic theme song of the preceding Indiana Jones films, the musical score in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade raises the scale of things and grasps its war themes incredibly well which brings a firm level of raw grit to the feature. John Williams deservedly reaches three for three with Academy Award nominations for his work on the Indiana Jones films.\nAnd the cast of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade prove once again brilliant.\nHarrison Ford brings his charismatic adventure spirit back to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and nails the character brilliantly once again. By this point in the series there is not too much new he can bring to the character, and yet the screenwriters find a way to ensure he does just that. The result ends up being an exploration of Harrison Ford's comedic charisma as he maintains the same cheesy yet legitimate heroism of the character while expanding upon his comedic value significantly more. This comes predominantly from his chemistry with Sean Connery which shows him working with the Academy Award winning actor very impressively. Harrison Ford's iconic charm pays a lot of benefit to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade by letting him carry the film on his shoulders once again. He is as strong as ever, and his determined involvement in the high calibre action scenes show his consistent physical strength as an adventure hero. Yet they do not play second fiddle to his natural acting charms as he once again gets every inch of the character well enough to transcend the archetype of a cheesy serial adventure hero, all while playing to his debt to such a character honourably.\nSean Connery is also a brilliant newcomer. As the father of Indiana Jones, Sean Connery's main value in the story is to make the tale more compelling and provide comic relief at the same time which he does with incredible ease. The man's natural charm draws viewers in, and the way that he works with Harrison Ford is just hilarious due to the father-son banter of the film. Sean Connery is at some of his all time funniest in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade because he serves as the comic relief and nails that with natural ease and charm, all while delivering his lines with an instinctive sense of wisdom to pay effect to the character very well. \nJulian Glover's role as Walter Donovan is also powerful. Although his part is brief, Julian Glover is easily able to go between being a seemingly friendly man and a relentlessly imtimidating villain. The transition is most unexpected and dramatically powerful, and the way that Julian Glover deals his words so tenaciously proves rather intimidating at times. He proves his strength in the dramatic aspects of the story as it progresses and we see more sides to the character, and Julian Glover keeps up with the progressing narrative of the story with a consistent sense of manipulative sadism buried within the role.\nAlison Doody makes a memorable appearance as well. As the damsel in distress trope has been exhausted by the preceding Indiana Jones films, Alison Doody has to take a new perspective on the female lead of this Indiana Jones adventure. The perspective proves to be a tricky one with unpredictable twists and turns where she consistently proves herself capable of making a consistent impression from both a comedic and dramatic perspective. Alison Doody proves herself a capable foil in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade by delivering a performance which stands out as strong enough not to be compared to Karen Allen or Kate Capshaw.\nLastly, River Phoenix's brief appearance is also very memorable. The way that River Phoenix captures the fearless dedication of Harrison Ford makes him a perfect embodiment of a younger Indiana Jones. He mimics the firm physical style of the character while putting his own charming spin on the role. River Phoenix is a perfect fit for the role, and his cameo is a clear signifier of his potential as a blockbuster star in a career which was cut tragically short. It is just great that we got to see him give it a shot for once in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade though.\n\n\nSo  Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade proves to be a brilliant sequel and excellent finale to the trilogy, bringing back the western theme from the beginning and integrating war themes in with top production values, exceptional action and an awesome cast.",

The acting and script are the same as the others; good, and the pace is about the same as well.  Overall it feels very similar, but with some better action.  More military based, maybe too big of a scale for even Indy to handle, but naturally he doesn't seem to have much difficulty.  The beginning is cool showing him when he was younger, and catching up with time as he finds the cross e was been always searching for.  Then it's all about the Nazies and the search for the book.  It has some good humour in the right places, is exciting and action packed, and isn't too serious.  The plane chase is awesome, the bike chase exciting and the tank battle in the desert is also a highlight.  There is no such tank in real life, but it is a convincing invention that is outdated for the time this film takes place.  The ending is actually not as over the top and dumb as the original and as the Crystal Skull, but still has it's fair share of laughing moments.   Of course the medieval knights didn't have the technology to make those traps, but the power of the water in the 'cup of Christ' was actually cool when both taking or giving life. Wish this wasn't the last film in the original trilogy, as it is one of the best ones, and has the classic cool feel.  Well done, probably my favourite in the series even over the original, simply because of the ending and less over the top powers and other small problems.  One of my favourite childhood movies.",

It bought back the action adventure elements that were missing in Temple of Doom and made this so fun and entertaining to watch. Along with the classic action sequences there was still plenty of room for the comedy that you expect in the series and it delivered a lot more that the previous film, as the first one did. Plot wise, it took an approach more similar to that of Raiders of the Lost Arc, which i found to be a very interesting and engaging plot. At some points it did feel like i had seen similar things in the first film but it was for the most part full of fresh new ideas, better comedy and surprise twists. \n\nThe best thing about this film had to be the addition as Sean Connery as Dr. Henry Jones, and his amazing chemistry with his son Indiana Jones. These two really led the movie for the last two thirds and they only made  it better. Their relationship was entertaining, funny, and felt really natural. Once again John Williams with another great score that can instantly improve any film with its classic, memorable songs. In the end Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade brings this series back to the tomb raiding that made the first film so memorable and provides another fantastic action adventure film that anyone can enjoy. - 8.7",

Sean Connery plays the unordinary, but smart father of Indiana in an interesting and quite humorous way.

It recycles a few elements from Raiders (The Nazi's as villains doesn't really work that well this time around, and is it just me or does the tank scene remind anyone else of the truck chase in the first film). That said, at its heart this is a film about family and bonding, and I really dig it's message.

I feel like this movie is just a rehash of many of the same devices in Raiders, but less effective. Like Spielberg just used the same formula as Raiders trying to recreate the success after Doom didn't go over so well. Maybe it's just the nostalgia because I've been obsessed with Raiders since I was a kid, but Crusade just doesn't do it for me. It's okay. I just don't think it's nearly as fun or exuberant and I just don't get excited watching it or get those \"WOW!\" moments that Raiders gives me. Donovan is pretty lame and weak compared to Belloq. There was this menacing danger looming about the Ark that I never felt with the Holy Grail. There's this weird \"Do you believe in the Grail?\" theme of faith and religion that I just don't understand. It's more about the father-son relationship and I just don't care. I think Elsa is flat and uninteresting in the token-hot-chick role. She's nowhere near as fully realized or enjoyable as Karen Allen. This movie is a little goofier and a bit harder for me to swallow in that respect. Raiders was goofy too but it was joyful and I don't feel that same joy here. The action scenes are pretty good, but to be honest I was nodding off during the plane and tank chases, given their length. I like all the stuff when they get to the cave at the end. The rapid-aging is a cool effect but I just don't get the same satisfaction and \"OMG! THAT WAS SO COOL!\" rush I get when those three guys get epically destroyed by the forces in the Ark. I'm sorry that I can't seem to take this movie on its own terms and not bring it's cool older sibling into review. I just hate seeing the first entry in a series be SO FRESH and then the director decides to just re-use the same formula for another installment to insure it's success. Can't stand it. Like Star Trek: Into Darkness and The Hangover II. Empire Strikes Back and The Dark Knight and Terminator 2 did it wonderfully. It can be done!",

So then what makes \"The Last Crusade\" a new adventure worth seeing? The answer is simple: Sean Connery as Dr Henry Jones, Indy\u00b4s father. The addition of Connery\u00b4s character creates a fun dynamic between him and his charismatic son who resents him a little because of the fact that his father was absent for most of his life; it becomes the film\u00b4s main plot point, overshadowing the search of the Holy Grail thanks to Sean Connery\u00b4s charismatic and funny performance at the same level as Ford is with Indiana. But even if the addition of Indy\u00b4s father makes the film stand out and provides some funny moments, it also makes the already over the top campy vibe even more silly and more difficult to take seriously.\n\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" is worthy final chapter of the trilogy thanks to Sean Connery\u00b4s performance and the chemistry between him and Harrison Ford, but emulates \"Raider of the Lost Ark\" too much and lacks its charm.",

That being said, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is even better. Obviously this is my opinion, and people will dispute this with me forever, and I'm perfectly willing to admit that nostalgia plays into my opinion somewhat. I was a bit young when I first saw Raiders, but Last Crusade hit me at the perfect age. But I do have reasons aside from warm fuzzy feelings that make me love Last Crusade so much. First and foremost of those is the humor. From the opening sequence all the way to the end there are so many good laughs in this movie. Just thinking of certain scenes have me chuckling as I type this (\"X marks the spot.\") It adds something to the action when they mix in that levity, and I find it irresistible. Then there is the big surprise of this movie. From the outset they sell viewers on this film being a retread of the same formula from the previous films in the series. But all of this is changed in one scene when we realize that Indiana will not be going on this adventure with another woman by his side. Instead the sidekick will be his father.\n\nHow awesome is Sean Connery? I mean his interplay with Harrison Ford is just amazing. This storyline gives some good background to the character of Indiana Jones and it also creates some added depth. I love that they largely eschew another shallow romance, and focus on a more character-defining relationship instead. This makes the climax of the movie so much more powerful, and I get the impression that Indy has actually grown by the end of the movie. Speaking of that climax, it is one of my favorite sequences in movie history. I love that the booby traps actually connect with the story being told. The one aspect I haven't even touched on are the action scenes, but they are worth mentioning because they are executed brilliantly. I greatly appreciate how they continued to use so many practical effects and professional stunt men. The boat chase, the plane chase, and the tank chase are all wonderful and get my heart pumping every time. Yes, I can't come up with a single complaint for Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. It is one of my favorite movies of all time and easily my top film in the franchise.",

With fine performances throughout the good guys in this, The Last Crusade is truly one that is a well played out one, and also very funny. Does it match up to Raiders, well we will have to see as I write this review but be safe in the knowing this is thoroughly entertaining stuff. \n\nHarrison Ford is of course the man donning the whip and fedora again and is off on yet another quest, but this time it is his father he needs. In this film we are introduced to Indiana's father, Henry Jones Sr, who to Indiana's annoyance always calls him \"Junior\". Sean Connery is the actor stepping into the boots of Jones Sr and he makes a fantastic addition to the series, I'd even go as far to say he is the best new character in the series since well, Indiana Jones. As for rest of the cast it is Julian Glover who I wasn't so keen on, I wasn't sure if it was the poor accent or just the circumstances that happen but I just felt he was a little stale. Denholm Elliot as Dr Marcus Brody returns, this time he is maybe not in it as much as he could have been but is still a welcome return and an addition to a cast full of personality. \n\nSpielberg I feel is not at his absolute finest here, his direction can feel a little sticky at times, not that it is bad but just not as good as say Raiders. It is written fairly well, the script not maybe blowing me away in the more serious moments or even parts where it is downright ridiculous, but the comedy styling that is put upon Connery and Ford is one of the up most brilliance. It is that partnership between them that is one of the most immortalising things about this movie, the addition of Connery's character instantly makes this better and the workmanship between him and Harrison Ford is one that for me makes them two one of the best film duos's of all time.\n\nThe effects are ramped up for this one, of course years had passed since the last two and the movie really knows how to utilize new found techniques. It is the explosions that for me are just better, this film is bigger than past seen, much more action means much more effects and it is great to see them used properly(and not overused either). Staying on the technical side of things the cinematography by Douglas Slocombe is still as ever marvellous, he just seems to know how to film an action adventure movie, never makes it boring angles, always quick but swift shots.\n\nSo, is this addition in the Indian Jones movie collection the best? well that is a tough question. Raiders of the Lost Ark I know is a movie people find a special one, a movie that many consider their all time favourite, of any movie period. For me although I did watch Raiders and found it really good, I think the Last Crusade is too and deserves a place like Raiders in the heart of film fans, I don't think the Last Crusade is anything special that saying, but is still a highly entertaining piece of cinema and one I feel will endure for years to come.\n\nSo overall the film is great, a movie I would recommend to anyone really as it contains a bit of everything, action, adventure but most importantly for me, it has laughter, this for me I can be sure of, is the funniest of the series.

The action scenes are typically thrilling and well shot, and are not as over-the-top as in Temple of Doom, the film offers loads and loads of great laughs, and Harrison Ford and Sean Connery have some of the best chemistry ever seen in film. Connery is only 12 years older than Ford, but both manage to convince the viewer they are real father and son, and though the film is often at its funniest when they're playing off each other, their relationship is also emotional and quite touching, without ever being sentimental. There is also fine support from Julian Glover and Allison Doody. It is really hard to find anything negative to say about this. The Last Crusade is one of Steven Spielberg's finest achievements, and quite possibly the best adventure film of all time.",

It has a stronger narrative than either Raiders and, certianly, Temple, while not sacraficing any of the trailblazing, swushbuckling, action/adventure sense of the first two. Despite having Nazi villians again, it doesn't feel stale, it feels fresher. The way the clues are laid out, the way the story unfolds, hooks the audience in more than the previous two. The other noticable aspect that distinguishes Last Crusade is the dynamic between both Ford and Connery, who have a fantastic chemistry, and represent what feels that an authentic relationshiop. That, and the more complicated character of Alison Doody, give the film both a lighter tone than Temple, yet a more nuanced air than Raiders. \nThe action, the characters, the writing, the direction, everything is exactly pitch perfect.

Of course, the film rests primarily on the shoulders of Harrison Ford, and he does not disappoint. The introduction of Sean Connery as Jones' professor father creates the perfect character foil, as their sparring with each other adds a good dose of humor. Additionally, Alison Doody gives a respectable performance as the icy Nazi agent Elsa. The plot, which revolves around a quest for the Holy Grail, is a little more exciting on paper than it turns out to be in practice. Still, there are plenty of exciting aspects of the Jones' adventures, from speedboat pursuits in Venice to a castle break-in in Germany. Indy even accidentally gets a book signed by Adolf Hitler while incognito in Berlin. Aside from the acting and plot, 'Crusade' benefits from another solid soundtrack from John Williams, which arguably is the proverbial \"cheery on top.\" Sure, it also has its share of cheesiness, but 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' is a classic wild ride that does what it's supposed to do - entertain audiences.",

The relationship between the two is multi-layered and nuanced; although they work in the same field, they have different approaches, and yet are quite capable of working together. Alongside the Jones boys, we have Marcus Brody (played as a funny man by Denholm Elliott) and Dr. Elsa Schneider (played OK by Alison Doody). John Rhys-Davis returns as Sallah, and they are opposed by Walter Donovan (played with good depth of character by Walter Donovan).\n\nThe plot is both action-packed and generous with comedy; it feels very natural, and the scenes progress well with each other.

I'm happy to report however, the very opening shot of the Last Crusade, being almost identical to the opening shot of Raiders of the Lost Ark, announces a return to form for Steven Spielberg and the Indiana Jones franchise.\n\nAll the old elements are here from the first movie. Indiana Jones recovers an artifact, only to have it taken away after a great opening action sequence. Just like Raiders. Indiana's nemesis is a collector of rare antiquities and is working for - you guessed it, Hitler and the Nazis, who - you guested it, are searching for a ancient biblical artifact promising supreme power to its owner. Did George Lucas just recycle Raiders?\n\nThat strict adherence to the Raiders play book is actually one of the Last Crusades main weaknesses. Thankfully though, this third installment has plenty of surprises of its own. Thanks in no small measure to the addition of Sean Connery as Indy's father, Henry Jones. In the Last Crusade, we get to learn a lot more about Indiana Jones and his family. Indy's childhood is explored. What happened to his mother is revealed, and why he became estranged from his father. It's also great to watch Harrison Ford and Sean Connery work together. The dialog between the two is sharp and witty, and they play off each other perfectly.\n\nThe action in any Indiana Jones movie is always fun to watch, and the Last Crusade is no different. From the castle escape and chase, to the battle with a Mark VII tank and the Nazis. The action as usual is fun, inventive and exciting to watch. The visual effects in this movie are thankfully kept to a minimum, and are a little more polished this time around.\n\nFull review -> Movie prep -> Best Format -> Best Element -> http://talkiegazette.com/indiana-jones-and-the-last-crusade-1989/\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette",

The climax is one of the most suspenseful and thrilling sequences I have ever seen. The film is fun, well written, funny, and memorable.

Well, here is one right in front of you.  \"The Last Crusade\" is (at least in my opinion) the best of the Indiana Jones films, even topping the original \"Raiders\".\n\nThe reason this film is so great is because it feels a lot like \"Raiders\" and avoids the mistakes of \"The Temple of Doom\".  The Nazis are once again the villains - like \"Raiders\" - but the film keeps it fresh and doesn't feel like a repeat.  Also, the introduction of Sean Connery as Henry Jones, Sr. was a huge addition to the cast.  How great is it that they snagged Sean Connery?!  Harrison Ford and Sean Connery have great back-and-forth banter throughout the film.  This creates a lot of outstanding comedy, without taking away from the action.\n\nEven though \"The Last Crusade\" doesn't have that new Indy smell, Indy still kicks butt.  This film is a great conclusion for several reasons: it is fun, thrilling, and exciting; it has a great balance of comedy and action; and it gets back to the roots of what made \"Raiders\" great.  And so, as Indy rides off into the sunset, I feel this is the perfect ending for the series, and I'm glad the Indiana Jones series ends on a high note.  Oh wait...",

I agree in some ways but I believe that Raiders of the Lost Ark is the best simply due to the action and the amazing acting and the element of surprise. This movie is still the second best and it was very good. I like how they went back to biblical historical artifacts. This one has the least amount of action, but it has the most background and explanation for things. A good \" ending\" to an amazing trilogy.",

            "content": "After the dark silliness and extravaganza of 'Temple of Doom', 'The Last Crusade' is a triumphant return to form! It feels more in spirt and tone with 'Raiders' as Indy go searching for another ancient artifact whist punching Nazis. But what makes this sequel superior to the original is that it actually features a  personal story arc for Indy to actually develops his character and finds tremendous heart that is a cut above the death-defying stunts and riveting adventure sequences. You can tell from the film's flashback prologue that there is something more at work with this film as we see a Young Indy (played to perfection by the late River Phoenix) develop many of the daring archeologist's defining attributes. And director Steven Spielberg establishes a stunted paternal relationship with Indy and his study-obsessed father that this film will effectively explore. \n\n\nSome fans claim this is a messy retread of 'Raiders', but I honestly don't see that at all! No question, the film holds true to the formula of the series but this has a more complex story and excels with emotional depth that was lacking from the previous two movies. The real highlight of course is the relationship between Indy and his father, Henry Jones, played by the great Sean Connery. Connery gives a faultless performance that elevates both the film and Harrison Ford's committed turn wonderfully. You can argue that the Indy's new love interest, Elsa Schneider, is bland but their romance is somewhat brief and the twist with her character works very well for the story. Julian Glover's villain role may not be Indy's perfect foil like Belloq nor is he gleefully menacing as Mola Ram but he is dastardly enough to fill that villainous void. The action set pieces are quite impressive while not as innovative as its predecessors, However, the tank sequence is just as amazing as the Desert chase in 'Raiders' if only a bit more intricately choregraphed and once again heightened by John William's magnificent music score. It only get better as Indy is not only tested physically but mentally and emotionally as he faces three fearful challenges of wits to recover the Holy Grail. Not only is it furiously cinematic but its emotionally gripping!\n\n\nWhile 'The Last Crusade may lack some of that gritty charm of the original, but gives us a better story. That focus on Ford & Connery's Father/son dynamic makes this the stronger film of the two and THAT moment near the end where his father calls him \"Indiana\" solidifies that sentiment. Add on a gorgeous closing shot of our heroes off riding into the sunset, not only is this the absolute pinnacle of action/adventure cinema but a perfect sequel and flawless film that brings the Indiana Jones trilogy to a magnificent close! - 10/10 (A+)",

The addition of Connery to the cast (as Indy's father) is a nice touch, providing further insight into the character development, though it does seem to be pushed a bit past the limit at times.  Still, in a film-ic version of old serials, limits were made to be pushed.  There is not much time to relax during the entire running time, but I don't see that as a problem.  The humor (through both the Marcus Brody and Saliah characters, as well as the interplay between the Fords) is in just about the right proportion (again though, it does push the limits).  The storyline harkens back to the \"Raiders\" style, drawing on religious themes and including everyone's favorite bad guys:  Nazis.  It's flicks like this which go a long ways to atoning for past mistakes (re:  \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\").",

Harrison Ford has always been charming and great in his movies. But his roles as the archeology professor with an appetite for adventures put viewers all over the world in excitement and contentment. Indiana Jones is without a doubt an unforgettable character. \"The Last Crusade\" is the third movie which on my opinion is the best. I've watched it countless times. The father - son relationship between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery (who plays his father) is remarkable. The wittiness, dangers situations and the funny commentaries from Ford and Connery makes this movie so much different, special and unique from the others. All that combined with the wonderful presence of the late Denholm Elliot and John Rhys Davies blasts the movie extremely high. Spielberg and Lucas did create a masterpiece which will outlive us and will always fascinate everyone. All of those who love adventures, danger, adrenaline, history will enjoy to the max this epic production.",

The addition of Sean Connery and River Phoenix alone is remarkable as both were great actors. The dynamic between Indianan Jones and his father (Sean Connery\u2019s role) is some of the best (estranged) father / son relationships in movies. Then there is River Phoenix who is only used in the introduction scenes but it is one of the best introduction scenes in movie history and tells you everything that you need to know about Indiana Jones. Also praiseworthy Paul Maxwell role here as man with the panama hat (Don't know if he is even named in the movie). Short appearance but so memorable that everyone remembers him. But lets go back to the movie. After the legendary good introduction scene Indiana Jones is informed that his father is gone missing on his search for the Holy Grail. The Grail is his fathers lifelong obsession and Indiana Jones only goes on a journey to save his father as they have a rocky relationship and are a bit estranged. This is the beginning of a legendary adventure. The story is excellent and I do not see any flaws here. It has the right pacing and a good mix of action, humor, good twists and character development. I know I sound like a fan boy here but its one of the best performances from director Steven Spielberg, writer George Lucas and the whole team. Lets go to the actors. Harrison Ford is always great in his signature role (Even in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) and this is his best performance as Indiana Jones. I already praised Sean Connery and this is also one of his most remembered roles outside of James Bond. River Phoenix died far to young and would be possibly one of the most acclaimed actors in Hollywood today. Paul Maxwell shines in such a small role. John Rhys Davies and Denholm Elliot return to their roles and this improves this movie too. Both are fan favorites and well remembered characters too. They have again not the longest screentime but make a great performance. Then there are the antagonists I wont spoil here. All are excellent and enjoyable villains. This is such a great cast and an awesome performance. The script, actors and directing accomplish each other. This movie has so many memorable scenes be it the humorous (Non spoilery example: No tickets, the special \u201cautograph\u201d or the stamp joke), action scenes (No spoilers here) or character developments (Again no spoilers here). Again the sets and special effects are top notch and everything looks amazing and believable. Also again we got the famous and legendary John Williams for the score. He should have deserved more credits as he improved every movie where he made the score. Overall while there is no perfect movie this comes close. It became the gold standard for Indiana Jones movies and action adventures while also becoming a cult classic. I rewatch it once in a while because it is a movie you can enjoy again and again.",

This is the third movie in the franchise and the final movie in the original trilogy and follows Indy searching for the Holy Grail, accompanied byIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade was released in 1989 and was directed by Steven Spielberg. This is the third movie in the franchise and the final movie in the original trilogy and follows Indy searching for the Holy Grail, accompanied by his father.I know that I've said this in every Indiana Jones review so far but Harrison Ford is still\u00a0amazing as Indiana Jones with his charisma and intelligence making him such a likeable character. Sean Connery is also amazing as his father and they both share similar characteristics; intelligent, charismatic and daring. Their chemistry and the way they work together on screen\u00a0is also great and they genuinely feel like father and son. What I also like about his character is that he doesn't feel slapped in and unnecessary just because they could have him in the movie and actually serves an important purpose to the story.I liked the side-characters of Sallah (who is back again from his first appearance in Raiders) and Marcus Brody as you could tell their characters weren't completely sure what they were getting into and had some quite goofy characteristics. However, this wasn't in an annoying way and instead added a much lighter tone to the story when it was required which helped give their characters a good reason to be there.There was definitely comedy in the previous two (well, maybe not as much in Temple of Doom) but in this film there are many more laughs than in the previous, many of the jokes coming from Indy's interactions with his father and that's another reason why I love this duo so much.The action is done very well like the other two films with great cinematography and lots of tension. I wouldn't say the action is as good as Raiders but it was certainly better than Temple of Doom.I prefer this one more than the others in the trilogy because it features a more personal story whereas in the others it was just a case of 'hey, let's go on an adventure'. What makes this one more personal is that it explores Indy's life much more by showing his younger days at the start and then obviously introducing his father which adds a lot more depth to the story.Overall, I loved this film. I liked it more than the other two because of its more personal story and more memorable characters. The action, while still great, isn't as good as Raiders but I found the great story and setting to be the highlight and stole the show for me. I would highly recommend this film, especially if you want to relieve yourself of the dark tone of Temple of Doom.8.5/10",

Directed by Steven Spielberg, this film has screenplay by Jeffrey Boam, and has Harrison Ford and Sean Connery in the lead roles.After the debacle of \"Temple of Doom\", this film intensified interest in the franchise and revive her success. In fact, the team formed by Ford and Connery is unstoppable and gives pleasure to see how professional is their interaction on screen. There are two established actors, Ford is very well suited with his role and Connery is a veteran with decades of experience and versatility. This clearly benefited the film, where these two artists outshines the rest of the cast, especially in humor moments, tearing laughter to the public. The script is good, all that \"Temple of Doom\" had to be and was not, recovering the vivacity and adventurous spirit that had been so intense in \"Raiders of Lost Ark\". The final sequences, filmed in one of the most stunning scenery I know - the Nabataean ruins of Petra in Jordan - are worthy of staying in memory of any movie lover. The photography is excellent, the visual and sound effects have great quality, some costumes were very well thought out and the soundtrack, not surprisingly, has fulfilled her role.It's no coincidence that there is a division on what is the best movie of this franchise: \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" or this one. There are some similarities between them, especially concerning the quality of final product. For me, if \"Raiders\" had a greater script and spirit of adventure, \"Last Crusade\" offset any fault with better humor, a stunning scenery and some breathtaking action scenes.",

Harrison Ford is just so amazing as Indy the addition of Sean Connery is perfect. His interaction with Indy is so hilarious I was gut busting laughing almost the entire time when these two were interacting. The plot is familiar but it doesn't really matter because Spielberg directs everything with such bravado that I was completely onboard once again. Nobody understands adventure better than Spielberg and this movie is so purely adventurous and fun! The action sequences are better than most blockbusters made today despite this film being 30 years old and the finale is so adrenaline fueled and I loved it. Everything is so practical and authentic and that is probably why it is still engaging.

Outside of being known as James Bond, I personally believe this to be Sean Connery's greatest role outside of Bond -- and a high recommendation for anyone interested to view any of the films which depict the dangerous exploits of Indiana Jones.In terms of action, there are some great set pieces in this one including a boat chase through the canals of Venice and race to beat a tank much later in the film. Sound effects, especially punches and slaps, have never sounded as good as in this film; elevating the distinct brutal nature of this series further.Although I thoroughly enjoyed this film, I admittedly didn't like Indy's love interest in this one - she isn't as memorable as what we were given in previous entries. I also found her true motives to be confusing. This is a minor complaint regardless, and shouldn't distract from the great cinematic fun to be found within.In conclusion, a strong recommendation from me. Even if you're not into these sorts of epics, you'll be sure to find some levels of enjoyment out of the relationship between the two main leads. It's well-paced, witty, and doesn't take itself too seriously - which is what I believe Indiana Jones has always been about from the start.",
