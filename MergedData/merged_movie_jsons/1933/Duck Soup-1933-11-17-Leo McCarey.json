            "content": "Well, here we are with another wild and hilarious Marx Brothers farce, this time with Groucho taking over a small country and winding up in war with a neighboring one.There really isn't much of a story but with the Marx Brothers that doesn't matter. Many times their movies were vehicles for their vaudeville acts of funny lines, slapstick gags and musical talent.Two differences in this film than most others from the boys: 1 - Zeppo has a number of lines. Usually, he's the almost-forgotten brother in this foursome, either with little to say or not even in the film. 2 - Harpo doesn't play the harp, but he gets in on his share of the gags, which are always dominated by Groucho and Chico (my personal favorite).Fantastic dialog makes this version one of the best of them all. There are just tons of funny (and, yes, very dated) lines in this movie and having Duck Soup out on DVD making the sound clearer helps, too. Lots of laughs.",

            "content": "There are a lot of reasons why so many different reviewers suggest that \"Duck Soup\" is a genuine candidate for the funniest movie ever made.  It has the Marx brothers at their very best, with rapid-fire laughs combining with a satirical \"plot\" that is very funny in itself, without getting in the way of the individual comedy sequences that are the real highlight of the film. Their timing and material are as good here as they ever have been.The Marx brothers are still beloved today because when at their best, they treated their audience to a lot of riotous slapstick that cannot be watched without laughing, while at the same time rewarding their viewers for paying attention with a steady stream of puns, deadpan one-liners, brief sight gags, and other subtler humor.  The more you watch, the more you notice.\"Duck Soup\" has a lot of their very best material, and everyone has their own favorite scenes, whether it is the mirror sequence, or Chico and Harpo giving their report to Louis Calhern, or the street vendor scenes, or ... . The variety of comic settings and comic material is amazing, and when you add in the entertaining musical sequences (which again are particularly good in this one), it is a feast that never stops.Any Marx brothers fan has seen this one several times, and does not need to be reminded what great fun it is.  If you have never watched one of their films, give this one a try.",

            "content": "One of the funniest films ever made, Duck Soup is total insanity and a fast pace by the Marx Brothers. Is this merely a string of gags or is this pungent political satire? Does it matter? Priceless gags include the famous \"mirror\" act, the lemonade stand, and some of the funniest plays on words ever heard. Groucho play Rufus T. Firely, who comes to the aide of struggling Freedonia, seemingly run by a wealthy society dame, Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont). Chico and Harpo play spies in the employ of the rule of Sylvania (Louis Calhern). Nothing makes sense but then this IS about politics. Fast pace zips this film along (directed by the great Leo McCarey) so that the gags and jokes are dizzying. The three brothers are all wonderful as is Dumont. Also thrown into the mix is the exotic Raquel Torres, funnyman Edgar Kennedy, and the lackluster Zeppo Marx. Best gags include the mirror act with Grouch and Harpo (redone on one of Lucille Ball's TV series with Harpo 20 years later); the lemonade sequence with Chico, Harpo, and Kennedy, and of course the bizarre war finale with the brothers and Dumont, who was one of the best comedy foils in film history.The usual Marx Brothers blend of skimpy plot, musical numbers and non-stop gags makes this the best of their films. Film history tells us Duck Soup was originally a flop, that it was the last of their films for Paramount, and the final film appearance for Zeppo (no loss there). The Marx Brothers were saved by Irving Thalberg at MGM, and the 3 brothers went on to a few big successes at that studio. One of the funniest films ever made.",

In \"Duck Soup\", the visual gags that worked so well on the stage are incorporated into the film. Director Leo McCarey directed this zany movie in which the Marx Brothers do their best to entertain their public.There are many interesting moments in the film, but the best sequence has to be the mirror scene in which Groucho, Harpo and Chico, dressed in the same costume are seen on either side of the looking glass following the other person's movements. The other asset in the film is the final conflict with Sylvania in which Groucho is seen dressed in many uniforms while leading the war against the enemy.We had seen this film before, but took another look when it was shown on cable recently. The great Margaret Dumont is simply one of the best actresses that ever worked with the Marx Brothers in their comedies. She is amazing in playing the straight part against Groucho's antics. A young Louis Calhern cuts quite a figure as the Trentino, the Sylvanian ambassador to Freedonia. Raquel Torres is a nice addition to the film playing the exotic Vera Marcal.The Marx Brothers do what they do best in \"Duck Soup\" guided by a director who knew what to do with them, Leo McCarey.",

At least the musical numbers in DS are actually worth sitting through.The reasons it scores so highly are:1) The mirror sequence. The finest comic sequence ever committed to film. Sure, it's old-hat vaudeville, but it's professional, beautifully timed and spirals into wonderful absurdity.2) The one-liners, puns and other jokes. Pick of the crop are the peanut stall interchange, the telephone sequence, the riddles ('what has four pairs of pants, lives in Philadelphia, and it never rains but it pours?') and the final battle (especially the stock footage of monkeys and elephants running to save the army under siege - the kind of thing the Zucker Bros pinched for their comedies). Oh, yes, and the motorcycle routines.3) The satire on politics and warmongering. The Brothers simply deflate the pomposity of the whole deal.4) The fact that Zeppo is actually given something to do.Anybody who thinks the Farrelly brothers are the last word in comedy should be strapped to a chair and shown Marx Bros films over and over again, until they concede.",

Groucho plays Rufus Firefly, who is appointed the new president of Freedonia. He has a dubious stance on work ethic and attempts to cut work hours by reducing the length of employee lunch breaks.Mrs. Teasdale, who has donated twenty million dollars to the failing country, becomes the object of affection for Rufus, who has to battle for her hand against Ambassador Trentino of the neighboring country Sylvania. Soon their tumult escalates and war is declared between the two countries.Most people who comment on this film seem to indicate that they saw it at a very young age and have grown up with it. I can honestly say I wasn't given the opportunity to ever see it until recently, when I finally managed to watch it on Turner Classic Movies, completely uninterrupted.Although it is not consistently laugh-out-loud, tears-in-your-eyes hilarious, \"Duck Soup\" is very funny - and not quite as outrageous as I had expected. There's a lot going on here, aside from silly physical humor.The Marx Brothers are great as usual and as usual Groucho steals the show.Ultimately if you've never seen this, you need to go rent it out right now. If you have seen it, you already know how great it is and why it deserves its reputation as one of the most beloved comedies ever made.",

HARPO as Snoopy the Spy, who shadows so many suspects he becomes afraid of his own shadow. Zeppo , voting for a standing army to save Freedonia money on chairs.Classic Marx film with many fun sequences , this is the most sustained bit of insanity with full of crazy gags , antics and funny scenes , today being deemed to be an ironical masterpiece and one of the biggest critics hits , including ordinary trappings , and anarchic , irreverent set-pieces. The Marx quartet are well accompanied by a good cast , such as : Louis Calhern , Raquel Torres , Charles Middleton , Edgar Kennedy as lemonade vendor and , of course, Margaret Dumont . Watch for Zeppo Marx as a love-sick tenor in this the last film with the Marx Brothers .The Marx Brothers were still at the peak of their fame in this Paramount musical/comedy. Although it suffers from staginess and musical numbers , but gives the zany threesome plenty of comic elaboration . It works very well , which , unfortunately and sadly , did not prove to be the case with most of the Marx Brothers pictures that went on . Enough gags for give several movies , but our favorite is still the diverting final at the bombarded house . Despite some songs the movie maintains itself very well . Groucho said that this was his favorite among his movies . The Marx Bros are in peak form in this vintage musical comedy with co-star the legendary Margaret Dumont , an obligatory appearance here playing usual wealthy hypochondriac and wealthy lady . This antiestablishment comedy was competently directed by Sam Wood , though failed miserably at the box office at the time of its release .Other important films starred by Marx Brothers -many of them Broadway farce plays transfered by scenarists into vehicle for the Brothers- , they are the following ones : \u00a8Animal crackers\u00a8, \u00a8Duck soap\u00a8 that was a flop when first released but today considered a masterpiece , \u00a8Horse Feathers\u00a8, \u00a8At the circus\u00a8, \u00a8A night at the Opera\u00a8,\u00a8Day at the races\u00a8 , \u00a8Room service\u00a8 , \u00a8Go West\u00a8, \u00a8Love Happy\u00a8 and \u00a8Night in Casablanca\u00a8, though in 1946 the Marx formula was weak and wearing thin.

            "content": "What can we say? Apart from the obvious. And that's to say that \"Duck Soup\" is the most brilliant of all the Marx Brothers' films, their finest masterpiece, the zenith of their unmistakable delirious and exhilarating comedy. It's a movie so full of visionary inventions, laugh-out-loud moments, memorable one-liners that you simply can't help but it burst into laughter.It's a movie so full of genius and so ahead of its time (it even anticipated Chaplin's \"The Great Dictator\") that even if back in the days, maybe because of this precise reason (and maybe because its cynicism may have not been the most well receivable sentiment in the midst of the Great Depression), it was kinda ignored or criticized or marginalized, it can still be seen today and it can still resonate and - let's say it again - make you laugh your guts out while, at the same time, make you reflect upon certain matters (for example about the sadly never-out-of-fashion warmongering craziness of the powers-that-be.)The Four Brothers, their gagmen and screenwriters, and the director expertly and wonderfully mix together anti-militarist satire, physical comedy and - of course - the usual unforgettable Groucho's one-liners, producing a caustic, chaotic, grandiose, wild and fast-paced roller-coster of a movie, that never shies away from launching sarcastic gibes left and right, in so doing banning any pretense of political correctness (if we are to use an anachronistic definition.) That's a good thing: because, clearly, political correctness, moralism and prudery are the death of satire. And what we have here is the pinnacle of satire: to this day it's still quite impressive to see just how fine and refined and hard-hitting the satirical comments are in this 1933 movie.Produced in a period when the most obnoxious and devastating tragedies of the 20th century were to some degree yet to come, \"Duck Soup\" is interwoven with slight allusions to the likes of chemical weapons, mass slaughters, future apocalyptic wars to be provoked by the hate and irrationality of delirious rulers (especially proto-fascist rulers...) and their cohort, exceptionalist, jingoistic and extreme rhetoric brought to their most awful (\"Hail, Hail Freedonia\", so much a land of \"the brave and the free\" to throw itself head and toes in a stupid and preventable war.)\nWhat we have said puts this movie on the same level as the Chaplin's one but also, for example, on the same level as Kubrick's unforgotten masterpiece \"Doctor Strangelove\".The freshness and novelty, and the infallible pace, owe something to the ability of McCarey who - in contrast with previous and even subsequent Marx Brothers' movies - \"decides to get rid of most of the standard and expected vaudevillian musical moments, to give more room to Harpo's pantomimes, to restrain Groucho's logorrhea, and to ultimately confer the story a surreal and zany style\" (F. Di Giammatteo) devoid of any useless time wasting gibberish and packed with a never-ending string of comic inventions more often than not crazy and hilarious (two examples: the mirror scene, which echoes Max Linder's \"Seven Years Bad Luck\", and the absurd visual gag concerning a certain peculiar \"presidential vehicle\" that's able to \"travel while never getting anywhere\").There's really not much there left to say: at this point I can only repeat myself. \"Duck Soup\" is the apotheosis of cinematic comedy, specifically of the Marx Brothers' peculiar blend of it. It's an all-around masterpiece of social-conscious satire and entertainment. It's a masterpiece, period. An unmissable milestone.Duck Soup = Dope Soup, everyone!",

            "content": "'Duck Soup' was my first Marx Brothers film, and I'd be lying if I didn't say I was slightly disappointed with it. After hearing about its comedic brilliance for the longest of times, it's an unfortunate inevitability that the film failed to reward my heightened expectations. The brothers' final production for Paramount Pictures, 'Duck Soup' was also the last screen appearance for Zeppo Marx, before he left the group to pursue other ventures (including opening a large theatrical agency with fifth brother Gummo). Though only mildly successful on its original release, the film has since grown greatly in stature, and is now considered by many to be one of the greatest comedies in cinema history. Obviously, I don't quite share this sentiment, but I'd nonetheless like to talk about the parts of the film that had me laughing.The plot for the film, which is basically a very loose narrative serving the sole purpose of connecting all the jokes, concerns the kingdom of Freedonia, newly-headed by Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx). Trentino (Louis Calhern), the ambassador of neighbouring kingdom, Sylvania, wishes to gain control of Freedonia by marrying the wealthy and influential Mrs. Gloria Teasdale (Margaret Dumont). To aid his cause, Trentino hires two spies, Chicolini and Pinky (Chico and Harpo Marx, respectively) to shadow Firefly and report on his movements. After relations between the two nations break down, their disagreements escalate into a fully-fledged war.Without a doubt, Groucho was my favourite of the quartet. Hidden behind his trademark fake moustache, eyebrows and glasses, his character is the epitome of quick wit, delivering a seemingly endless stream of puns, double entendres and insults. The verbal gags come so thick and fast that, by the time you've registered the punchline and finished laughing, you've already missed the subsequent three jokes. Chico also has his fair share of good lines, and Harpo \u0096 the silent member of the crew \u0096 has a lot of fun with the physical side of comedy, with the help of a limitless supply of props hidden within his clothing. Perhaps it was just my general ignorance, but it took me a very long time to work out which character was played by Zeppo, usually regarded as the \"straight-man\" of the group.The mirror pantomime sequence \u0096 first used in Charles Chaplin's 'The Floorwalker' \u0096 is a classic gag, and probably my favourite of the lot. Harpo's peculiar habit of using his scissors to snip everything within reach also brought a few solid laughs, not to mention Groucho's energetic delivery of quick-witted wisecracks. However, it all seemed so inconsequential. At the end of the day, once the 68 minutes were over, it didn't seem as though anything had been achieved. I've never really been a huge fan of the so-called \"anarchic comedy\" genre (for example, 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975)' left me completely cold), and so perhaps it's just a matter of personal preference. In spite of this, I did find 'Duck Soup' sufficiently entertaining to warrant another exploration into the films of the Marx Brothers.",

The brothers would go on to make some more good movies but, in my view, their Paramount films are when they were at their best. The nonstop zaniness and unpredictability of them was unlike anything else in film comedy at the time. This is a hilarious satire with Groucho in arguably his most famous role, Rufus T. Firefly, the newly-appointed leader of the small country of Freedonia who leads his country into war with neighboring Sylvania. The brothers are all terrific with some of their most memorable gags in this one. Margaret Dumont is back after missing two consecutive movies. Her scenes with Groucho are some of the film's highlights. Louis Calhern makes for a fine villain and Raquel Torres is one of the sexiest women from any of the Marx films. Edgar Kennedy is a hoot as a vendor that has trouble with Chico and Harpo. It's directed by Leo McCarey, who went on to win Oscars and direct some classic films with Cary Grant and Bing Crosby. Duck Soup also has probably the highest quality production values of any of the Marx films at Paramount. The sets and costumes are very nice. It's easy to see why this is considered the Marx Brothers' masterpiece.

It's the shortest film the brothers ever did, but there's hardly a minute in it without a gag or three.I think that Leo McCarey had in mind a satire on the Merry Widow, where if you'll recall the plot has the richest widow in Marovia ready to leave the country bag and baggage for Paris. It's up to Count Danilo to woo her for the country. People have done worse for patriotic motives. A silent version by Erich Von Stroheim was already made of The Merry Widow and next year Jeanette MacDonald and Maurice Chevalier would do it for MGM. But here we have Freedonia's richest citizen, Margaret Dumont not willing to underwrite her little country unless she names its prime minister. And of course she names the man wooing her, Groucho Marx. Of course that foils the plans of Louis Calhern, the ambassador from neighboring Sylvania. War eventually breaks out between the two countries over some absurdities you'll have to see to believe.Harpo and Chico play a pair of hapless spies who change loyalties at the turn of a dime and seem to wind up doing more good for whoever they're working against at the moment. They even take time to have a battle with poor Edgar Kennedy. Note that scene in the bathtub with Edgar Kennedy and Harpo, it may be Harpo's best moment from their films.This was Zeppo's last film, he did not make the journey to MGM with his three brothers. I'm not sure too many people noticed because his contribution seem mostly to act as a foil for Groucho's barbs. He became an agent and as a comic he was a good agent.Duck Soup is only 68 minutes long, but you cannot believe how many laughs you can get in a picture that short.",

            "content": "\"If you think this country's bad off now, just wait till I get through with it\", Groucho sings while being sworn in as President of Fredonia (no relation to the small New York city in Chautaqua County) where he actually rules as dictator. Ironically the same year as the rise of Hitler in Germany, this parallels the absurdities of dictatorships with Groucho not apologizing in any manner for his promise of \"We stand them up against the wall and pop goes the weasel\" for breaking any law he passes. Of course, he can't get out of his house because every time he does, his chauffeur (Harpo!) takes off in the motorcycle, leaving Groucho behind in the sidecar, and later switching places with hysterical results.With a name like Rufus T. Firefly, you know what kind of character Groucho is going to be, especially when he makes a pass at his benefactor, the wealthy Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont, back with the boys after a two-picture absence), all the while insulting her at the same time. He creates an instant rivalry with the ambassador from another country (an imperious Louis Calhern) and when war is declared, all zany hell breaks loose. There's even a minstrel show musical number about the declaration of the war, and with Harpo and Chico as spies, you know that the spying game is going to be downright hysterical. Chico and Harpo take up in a zany argument with fellow street vendor Edgar Kennedy which has some truly outrageous visual gags. Raquel Torres takes over for Thelma Todd, vixen from the previous two entries here, but no vixen, no matter how sexy, can get one over on Groucho. Ironically, the director this time around is Leo McCarey who usually went for sentiment. Here, the atmosphere is downright parody of an unsettled world on the verge of another war, perhaps a little ahead of its time, but a film that today is considered ingenious and probably the most famous of the Marxx Brothers' films. It was so controversial in its day that the politicians from the real Fredonia, New York wrote to Groucho in protest. You know who came out the winner.",

            "content": "There, I've said it. Although I absolutely love A Night at the Opera as well too, Duck Soup is my personal favourite Marx Brothers comedy for several reasons. First of all, I love the humour in the Marx Brothers movies, their movies have a rough-around-the-edges sort of humour that I feel is very unique. Secondly, Zeppo is given something to do- normally Zeppo comes across as underused and bland, but while he is not the funniest here he has something worthwhile to do. Thirdly, there is no love story or musical interludes, I have nothing against them, as A Night at the Opera actually had both and they worked, but when it interferes too much like it does in some of the Marx Brothers later comedies it can lessen the film's appeal a bit.Fourthly, I love the dialogue- the insults, the puns, the witty exchanges between Groucho and Margaret Dumont, they are now comedy classics, something you can quote this day and still laugh about it with your friends. Fifthly, the mirror sequence is absolutely brilliant, in fact it is one of my all-time favourite scenes in a Marx Brothers film, along with the shenanigans inside Groucho's cabin in A Night at the Opera. Why do I like this scene? Well, it is very clever and surreal in how it's placed and how it's choreographed, and it is timed beautifully. It is one of those scenes that is always imitated and very rarely/never equalled.Sixthly, I love the skill of the direction, it is very playful and clever. Seventh, Duck Soup is beautifully filmed, the sets, costumes and cinematography are great. Eigth, the story is a good one, it doesn't feel contrived or creaky but it compliments the comedy well. Ninth, the score is wonderful, quirky and very pleasant on the ears. Finally, I love the performances, all the Marx Brothers play their parts brilliantly, Groucho coming off best, while Margaret Dumont is great as the stately matriarch. Overall, a truly wonderful film and a gem of a comedy. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Meanwhile, the neighbouring country of Sylvania is plotting to overthrow Freedonia and sends Pinky (Harpo Marx) and Chicolini (Chico Marx) to spy on Firefly. War seems inevitable.Starring the Marx Brothers and viewed as a comedy classic, I was expecting great things from Duck Soup. However, while it has its moments, it was largely a disappointment for me.Having seen several of their previous movies, I knew what to expect. However, even then, this movie seemed quite silly. The others revolved around Groucho's quickfire wit and Chico and Harpo's slapstick comedy and Duck Soup is no exception. However, here it seems less clever than the best of the others, especially A Night At The Opera and A Day At The Races. Here, Groucho's witticisms wander into the territory of dad jokes and Harpo and Chico's clowning is often quite silly. The plot is okay, though not brilliant. Hardly the powerful anti- war and political satire movie it is made out to be.This all said, there are some great laugh-out-loud moments and these are enough to sustain the movie.",

Like most of the boys' movies there are constant distractions, puns, posturing, and insanity. The mirror scene is astonishing and has been copied so many times.

Groucho is on fine form as Firefly and Chico and Harpo impress as the two spies; as is often the case Zeppo has a fairly small role. While there are many great scenes my personal favourite had to be the perfectly executed 'mirror scene' where Groucho and 'Harpo disguised as Groucho' move in unison as if an image in a mirror with Groucho unsure if he is looking at a reflection of not.

The film takes place the same year as Hitler's appointment in Germany, an event which coincides with Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx) being appointed the ruler of the fictitious land of Freedonia. Unsurprisingly, Firefly, who wakes up with a cigar in his mouth, descends from his bedroom via a firefighter's pole and executes civilians to the tune of \"pop goes the weasel!\", is a fascist, the land of Freedonia (the name is a pun \u2013 there's no freedom in Freedonia) linked to fascist Italy, Germany and, with the use of Patriotic American tunes, Depression Era America.Much of the film revolves around an escalating war between Freedonia and a neighbouring country called Sylvania. This allows the film to indulge in, not only the usual Marx Brothers jokes (much anarchy, absurdity, puns, sight gags, one liners etc), but some funny political satire. And so there are digs at fascism, jingoism, deranged warmongering, an antiwar vein in which war movie heroics are spoofed, a condemnation of the judicial system, patriotism and even religion, as evidenced in Groucho's song \"We got guns, they got guns, all God's chillun got guns!\" The film's satire even goes all the way up to the White House, especially with this quote spoken by Groucho: \"And remember while you're out there risking life and limb through shot and shell, we'll be in here thinking what a sucker you are.\"9/10 \u2013 One of cinema's first antiwar satires, \"Duck Soup\" is essentially a precursor to \"Dr Strangelove\". Charlie Chaplin tried to follow in \"Duck Soup's\" footsteps seven years later with \"The Great Dictator\", but couldn't quite top the Brothers' brand of rapid fire banter.

It's uncompromising in vision which is a rarity considering 1933 where studios determined what has to be shown. Marx brothers who are considered as comedy giants in their times, gave wonderful performances in this film. From a retort to \"Tanks\" (which is thought as \"Thanks\") with a \"Welcome\" to many many moments where it's tough to hold back our laughs, this film is spanned with nothing but wit and comedy. I dare say, it is one of the funniest films I watched in a long time. It's hilarious and comical, it's also strongly satirical and political too. It takes on war, politics behind war and what kings or rulers do. The best part is it never takes itself seriously even for iota of a moment and gives out gags where each one is wonderfully joyful. Groucho Marx as Firefly, gives a wonderful performance probably the finest of his life from the word go. He dances, sings, and utters some of the wittiest lines uttered ever on film screen. His act as a Mussolini like is wonderful and more so as excellency of Fredonia. From his entry till the last frame, he makes this film his own. He is ably supported by his own brothers Harpo, Chico and Zeppo who give wonderful scenes too. My only crib is that it is too short. At 68 minutes, this film gives out so many wonderful moments that it leaves us yearning for more. Should this have been edited, I would be very disappointed, coz every frame is precious in this film and has to be embraced. This film is now 80 years old and it is still so young and infectious in wit and the sheer energy on screen. I wish again, to see more than 68 minutes of this.

            "content": "There are two groups in the \"Best Marx Brothers Movie Ever\" debate. One favors the Marxes integrated into the traditional Hollywood formula: the excellent \"A Night at the Opera\"; the other insists it's the film where Hollywood is helpless while the boys unleash their anarchistic, trademark lunacy against conventions to new heights: \"Duck Soup.\" I am in the latter group.The plot in a nutshell: The Marx Brothers go to war.The government of Fredonia has been mismanaged to the point that it must borrow $20 million from Mrs. Chester Teasdale to stay afloat. She, with single-minded termination, refuses unless the president resigns and hands the government to Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) who proceeds to bring the nation to a grinding halt. Adding to the national woes, neighboring Sylvania has been plotting to have the Fredonian government overthrown so that they can overrun it and this mission has been headed by Ambassador Trentino (Louis Calhern), with Vera Marcal (Raquel Torres) handling Mrs. Teasdale and his two crack spies Chicolini and Pinky (guess who) shadowing Firefly. It is presidential assistant Bob Roland(Zeppo) who suggests Firefly insult Trentino who will strike Firefly and they can force the ambassador to leave the country. Sounds good on paper, but Firefly winds up being insulted by Trentino then slapping him, which leads to a declaration of war! And what a war it is: Groucho is able to be uniformed as a southern general, northern corporal, boy scout, fur trapper and drum major -- and that's during the first assault! By the time the short-wave radio cries \"Help is on the way!\" what follows will have you rolling on the floor!Duck Soup is the dazzling, frenzied, unrelenting, full-steam-ahead, no-holds-barred trademark brand of nose-thumbing, up-yours comedy that the Marx Brothers created in vaudeville, honed to razor sharpness in bus and truck tours, and finally exploded onto 1920's Broadway, making them national treasures. Where W.C. Fields had his muttering, cynical way of tilting at windmills with a pool cue, Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and Zeppo stormed the windmills with surface-to-air missiles. No convention was too big, no icon too treasured, no societal norms too entrenched to be blistered by these madmen of surreal comedy. As with most classics, \"Soup\" bombed at the box-office and Paramount didn't re-sign the Brothers. But time and succeeding generations have elevated this film to one of the best movies in the annals of American film making.Within \"Duck Soup\" is a treasure trove of priceless routines. To mention a few: Firefly's coronation and musical offering of how he'll run the country; Harpo and Groucho with a motorcycle and sidecar; Chicolini and Pinky's spy report to Trentino; Groucho's cabinet meeting; Harpo's phone conversation, the three (count 'em three) encounters with a lemonade vendor; three night-gowned Fireflys racing around the Teasdale mansion seeking the secret war plans, which leads to the legendary and Dali-like Mirror Sequence (Continuity be damned. Who cares if shattered glass disappears or a complete reversed room is behind that wall mirror -- this routine is CLASSIC); Chicolini's court-marshal and trial, all leading to the musical embodiment of national hysteria for warfare: \"The Country's Going To War\". Scripted by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby (they composed the music for the Marxes Broadway show, \"Animal Crackers\") with Arthur Sheekman and Nat Perrin, the story is a sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of laugh lines and hysterical visuals that skip merrily into surrealism. Kalmar and Ruby's music here (their \"Hooray for Captain Spaulding,\" became the theme music for Groucho's quiz show and the popular standard, \"Who's Sorry Now?\" was theirs. MGM made them the subject of \"Three Little Words\") is enjoyable, albeit unmemorable and their lyrics an homage to Gilbert and Sullivan. The break-neck direction and pacing is courtesy of fabled director Leo McCarey (best remembered for directing Going My Way). Margaret Dumont returns as \"the fifth Marx Brother\" with her oh-so-refined and dignified Mrs. Gloria Teadale, Groucho's perfect foil for his mangy-lover/insult barrage. There are superb supporting cast members, too. Louis Calhern (Annie Get Your Gun) is dignified and oily as Ambassador Trentino (what better target for Chico and Harpo?). Also in tiny roles are Leonid Kinsky as the agitator in Trentino's office prior to the entrance of Harpo and Chico (Kinsky went on to be best remembered as Sasha the bartender in Casablanca) and Charles Middleton the prosecuting attorney best remembered as Ming the Merciless in the old Flash Gordon serials. Finally, there is the brilliant Edgar Kennedy, crowned \"The Master of the Slow Burn,\" as the lemonade vendor. Kennedy was a staple of the silent film era, appearing in and directing hundreds of silent comedies and also producing them. A master craftsman and his work here with Harpo and Chico is a fitting tribute to his significant contribution to the movies. This film marked the farewell of Zeppo. Tired of playing the straight man and overshadowed by his brothers, Zeppo stepped behind the cameras after Duck Soup to become a Hollywood agent. He wasn't missed. Also, this is the only Marx movie where Harpo has no harp solo and one of two movies where Chico doesn't play the piano \u0096 and it doesn't matter. You're laughing too hard to care.Despite an unintended racial slur that mars the film this is a movie to treasure. I introduced my six year old niece to the Marx Brothers last summer. Having been weened on a diet of TV kiddie shows, computer animated cartoon films, and the pablum and sludge that passes for comedy today, she fell in love with the Marx Brothers! Yes, Harpo is her favorite, but she enjoys them all. So please, please, please, sit your kids down in front of the TV, get this movie and enrich them with unrestrained, genuine laughter, and introduce them to the funniest comedy team this nation ever produced and arguably the funniest movie ever made.",

Chico plays his usual shifty fake Italian self and is as stupid as ever cracking a variety of puns that range from the atrocious to the \"I can't believe I am laughing at such a poor joke\" level. Harpo is magnificent and his facial expressions and slapstick skills are great here. Zeppo, as ever, has little to do, but does it well.

Moustached dictator takes charge of European nation plunging it into war, an Italian turncoat changes sides when things go bad. Less than 10 years later Duck Soup played out for real as a tragic drama in the real Europe, which I always thought was an eerie coincidence.Now you have something new to think about.Continue.",

            "content": "Having never seen a Marx Brothers film before, I watched \"Duck Soup\" not knowing what to expect other than what the hype led me to believe. My impression of the Marx Brothers beforehand was that they were a more socially-accepted, somewhat highbrow version of the Three Stooges that focused more on witty jokes than slapstick. There was Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and sometimes Zeppo, with Groucho being the best-known of the bunch due to his long career on the \"You Bet Your Life\" TV show and the \"nose, glasses, and mustache\" disguise based on his appearance.I didn't think \"Duck Soup\" was terrible, certainly not enough to prevent me from checking out another Marx Brothers film some time. A few scenes involved humorous takes on traditional comic themes like mistaken identity and the man-in-the-mirror routine. But after viewing \"Duck Soup\", it would seem that I was overestimating the Marxes. Partly to blame is the hype surrounding the film, which leads one to expect comic brilliance and intelligent satire, rather than the frequently abrasive gags to be found here (and the satire that is not to).After the unsettling title image of live ducks flailing about in what looks like a pot of steaming water, the quartet of Marxes soon makes its presence known. Zeppo is barely noticeable, and so neither good nor bad, but Chico turns out to be an Italian stereotype, and, even sadder, the star Groucho is a rude, irritating punk rather than a hilarious funnyman. A disappointment, since he is the star around whom the plot revolves. Meanwhile, the \"great\" Harpo is one of the most unlikable, unappealing physical comedians I've ever seen. I found nothing amusing or clever about his habits of leering at people and destroying their personal property, either with scissors or his own brute force. Nor was it funny to see him continually lift his leg in the air in an inexplicable manner, as if he was a dog about to pee or something.Some of the funny parts are at the end during the climactic battle. The thing is, it's just Three Stooges stuff that critics would scoff at if it appeared outside of a Marx film. Sticks of dynamite with extra-long fuses, getting locked in a closet, immobilizing the bad guy and throwing garbage in his face\u0085these are all conventions of Stooge slapstick, and in \"Duck Soup\" seem to be filmed in the same style as those shorts. I am almost positive that I've seen Moe, Larry, and Curly do a military sketch that was much the same.Many people have held this film up as a \"comic masterpiece\" and even a \"brilliant political satire\" about politics, with lots of tie-ins to fascism and the rise of Hitler, natch, although this film was made long before the Nazis went into full swing. I think that this praise is applied too liberally by adoring fans and critics who wish to appear well-informed and sophisticated and are only too willing to join the bandwagon. In his review for \"Duck Soup\", Roger Ebert quotes some British critic named Patrick McCray who called the film \"an absurdist essay on politics and warfare [ that ] can stand alongside (or even above) the works of Beckett and Ionesco.\" Really, now, Beckett and Ionesco? Is \"Duck Soup\" deserving of such high regard? To me, the film seems more like a chance for a few comedian brothers to make a light comedy together, make some money, and have some fun. It's not an awful film, but not a great one, either, and certainly not a watershed in American film comedy.I could detect little pertinent satire. While the targets being lampooned are fictional, they seem closest to the old excessive European monarchies that were around for centuries until World War One. The political environment consists of lavish palaces, grand balls with royal fanfares and pomp, and continental ambassadors in ornate uniforms. But absolute monarchies no longer determine world events, even in 1933, and so a good deal of \"Duck Soup's\" alleged relevance is nonexistent to begin with. It's easier to ridicule a style of government that hasn't led the way since decades ago. Perhaps the strongest joke arrives within the first few minutes of the film, when a wealthy donor threatens to withhold a political donation unless the current administration appoints a new leader of her choosing. This is a sharp parody of political systems in which money has become the deciding factor. Today the scene reminds US viewers how money and connections more than anything else brought our current prez (and many pols) to power, the controversy about campaign finance reform, etc. Unfortunately, after this opening bit, the film fails to offer anything else on this level, nothing to make the work as a whole a perceptive social satire.After this comment was first posted, I gave the Marx brothers another chance when I watched \"A Day at the Races,\" and was pleasantly surprised. Sometime I'll get around to checking out their other movies.",

            "content": "A big glass eliminate.\"Duck Soup\" is often hysterical madcap comedy, showcasing the legendary Marx Brothers unit to great effect. The songs are catchy, the energy incredible, and the delivery breathless. Many of the comedies of today have got nothing on this level of invention, satirical detail, and genuine belly laughs.The irrepressible Groucho is Rufus T. Firefly, elevated to the position of president / dictator of tiny, financially strapped country Freedonia. Rufus' cheeky and sardonic ways only serve to create problems, not the least of which is rubbing the leader of the neighbouring country Sylvania the wrong way.The one-liners come fast and furious, and the cast plays the entire thing to perfection. Among the many set pieces are the repeated scuffles Harpo and Chico, as spies Pinky and Chicolini, get into with a street vendor, the sight of three Grouchos running about (as Pinky and Chicolini masquerade as Rufus in order to get their hands on valuable battle plans), and of course the one sequence that everybody remembers, the mirror sequence - a classic bit of comedy. Margaret Dumont is a delight in her perpetual \"straight woman\" role, often uttering her lines in a priceless sing-song style.It's too bad that this would be the last time that Zeppo would act with his brothers, as he's given a fair amount to do here, and one of the biggest joys is seeing the brothers performing together near the end. Harpo gets some big laughs with his silent comedy; the moment where he's showing off his tattoos is a riot.Clocking in at a tight 69 minutes, the movie maintains a fine forward momentum and builds towards a priceless finale where, among other things, Rufus fires on his own soldiers!Overall, this is an absolute must for any comedy fan, as it starts brightly and keeps coming up with enough witty exchanges to make for very pleasant viewing.Nine out of 10.",

            "content": "\"Duck Soup\" is considered by many to be the best film comedy the Marx Bros. ever made, and even though it is not one of my personal favorites, I do enjoy it very much. This boisterous political satire is absolutely rife with visual gags from Harpo and verbal humor from Groucho & Chico. The plot of \"Duck Soup\" is quite negligible: the fun-loving Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) becomes the newly-appointed dictator of Freedonia and, just for kicks and giggles, declares war on the neighboring Sylvania. The wealthy widow responsible for Firefly's appointment is none other than Gloria Teasdale (Margaret Dumont), who mistakenly envisions Firefly as the epitome of virtue and refinement. Later on, Firefly attracts the attention of two dimwitted Sylvanian spies named Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo), who eventually join forces with him.My favorite scenes from \"Duck Soup\" include the following (but please do yourself a favor and watch this classic film first before you read on). To begin with, who could forget the classic \"trick mirror\" scene between Firefly and Pinky? Firefly oversleeps and arrives late for his inauguration as dictator of Freedonia; he wastes no time at all insulting his sponsor Mrs. Teasdale with a barrage of puns, and he sings a wacky song that explains how he intends to run the country. When Pinky rides through the streets on horseback as Paul Revere, he suddenly spots a young lady undressing in front of a window; the musical accompaniment shifts abruptly from the \"Light Cavalry Overture\" to \"Ain't She Sweet.\" Chicolini and Pinky go through a good deal of verbal and visual gags during their initial secret conference with Sylvanian ambassador Trentino (Louis Calhern). While inside Firefly's conference room, Firefly offers Chicolini a job as his secretary of war, but first they exchange a few \"important questions\"; Pinky later drops in and shows Firefly a series of tattoos, some of which are animated! And finally, Chicolini and Pinky get the better of an infuriated lemonade vendor (Edgar Kennedy) by playing a silly little hat game; Pinky later sticks his bare legs and feet into the lemonade tank, thus driving all the customers away.As wonderful as \"Duck Soup\" is, it's a shame that it doesn't feature a piano solo from Chico or a harp solo from Harpo. In addition, even though the film runs a brief sixty-nine minutes, it does tend to drag during the final battle scene. But these issues are very minor considering \"Duck Soup\"'s status among all the various classic film comedies. This is a film that simply cannot be ignored.",

At 68 minutes, it could hardly be considered long, but if it was much longer I felt it would have worn out its welcome. The Marx Brothers' trademark humor has aged well, but I felt that some of the wordplay was hit or miss. This might be due to the rapidity with which Groucho spits out the lines, because not all of them were funny to me and quite possibly because some of them went over my head. What I felt was the best part of the movie were the physical comedy routines. As such, my favorite parts were a running gag in which Harpo torments a lemonade salesman, a scene involving a mirror and the final act where Groucho changes costumes in every scene. Since the movie is one of the earlier \"talkies\", the acting is somewhat stiff/stilted (in a cinematic context, but perfectly normal in a theatrical context). Margaret Dumont's Mrs. Teasdale is probably the best example of this, although her character was supposed to be that way. Overall, I thought the movie was very well done, but I got the feeling that the Marx Brothers have done better. This type of comedy mostly works for me, and I look forward to delving further into the Marx Brothers' filmography.",

            "content": "It's hard to believe the most highly praised Marx Bros. film today, Duck Soup, was a disappointment at the box office. I believe it was Irving Thalberg who said the problem with Duck Soup was that it was too funny. Audiences weren't used to such fast paced comedy with little structure. I think there is an element of truth to this. Out of all of the Marx Bros. films with Paramount, Duck Soup is a contender for the weakest plot. However, I believe this is why it is praised so much today. It is sheer, unadulterated Marx Bros. anarchy, without the romance interludes or intrusive musical numbers. Some of the Brother's best material is in this film. There are too many hilarious jokes to mention, but the mirror sequence, Harpo's Paul Revere scene, and Groucho's opening song are priceless gems. A similar mirror sequence was featured in the now classic Harpo Marx episode of I Love Lucy. This film has aged better than all of the Marx Bros. movies. As Roger Ebert wrote in his book The Great Movies, many of the jokes in this film seem surprisingly modern. For example, Harpo has a tattoo of a dog house on his chest, and when Groucho meows like a cat, a real dog pops out of it and barks. I could easily see something like this happening in any comedy today, and it would be just as effective. Groucho plays Rufus T. Firefly, the new dictator of Fredonia. Chico and Harpo play Chicolini and Pinky, two spies from Fredonia's enemy, Sylvania. The two countries go to war for reasons too silly to mention. Zeppo pops up every now and then. This was Zeppo's last film. He never really enjoyed making movies, and I believe it took some convincing to get him to do this film. Unfortunately he was always stuck playing the straight man, and he never got a chance to do anything funny. Zeppo actually was Groucho's understudy when they were on stage, and he supposedly got big laughs whenever he got the chance to play Groucho. Whether or not Zeppo could have been as famous as his other brothers if he had been given the chance will always be one of Hollywood's greatest mysteries. Duck Soup ended the Marx Brother's contract with Paramount, and they went on hiatus for two years. Chico was able to negotiate a contract with MGM, and they made two more great films, A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races, before their careers took a major nosedive, from which only Groucho was able to recover. It is said that there was a real town named Fredonia, and the mayor or town council sent a letter to the Marx Bros. complaining that the movie was ruining the image of the town. The Marx Bros. responded with a letter stating \"change the name of your town, it's ruining our movie!\"",

However when they ask for another $20 million from her she insists that she'll only give it over on the condition that the current leader step aside for the influential statesman Rufus T Firefly. And so it is that the people of this happy country cry out in gladness for their new leader even though he does nothing to endear himself to his Government. As he does just what he pleases, the neighbouring country of Sylvania sends in Pinky and Chicolini as spies to try and find out something about Firefly. However with such people is positions of power, anything could happen.Easily the best of the Marx Brothers' films, Duck Soup has the music and comedy that we expect from them but it also serves as a great satire on war, politics, religion, the justice system and many other targets from polite civilisation. The plot is thin if you are coming to it looking for a well rounded story with a start, middle and end but it does have these themes running through it and it means that it is never tiresome or repetitive. Of course at its heart the real reason we are all here is the great material that the brothers serve up. My favourite and most dominate aspect of the film is Groucho's material. He is so sharp and quick that it is easy to have one laugh after another drawn out of you. The musical numbers are stronger here than in other films \u0096 here they are funny and part of the narrative as opposed to other films where you get the feeling that they are playing instruments for the sake of it.Groucho is great value and does well throughout. He is supported well by Chico although I always found Harpo to be quite limited. Zeppo makes an appearance as one of the dull brothers and doesn't make much of an impression. Dumont is a good sport and good fun in a role that mostly involves coping with Groucho's barbs. The rest of the cast mainly support the manic humour with Calhern being another example of someone just soaking it up as a good straightman.This is a great film. Fans of the Marx brothers will love it as it is a sheer melody of irreverence, wit, intelligence and invention from start to finish. Everything works and it is a consistent delight.",

            "content": "First off, let me say I think Groucho Marx was at his funniest as host of a program called \"You Bet Your Life\" which today's kids have probably only heard about or seen on shows like Nickelodeon. There, his one liners were off the cuff, not made up by script writers, and he was genuinely funny ad libbing his way through a sometimes hilarious program with daffy guests who made it easy for him to kid the pants off them.But in a Marx Bros. movie, all of the one liners are scripted, not ad libbed, as some of the reviewers here seem to think. The script for DUCK SOUP is fast paced nonsense, all of it bordering on the utmost absurdity, but managing to get the chuckles because it's the sort of romp one expects from the zany foursome.Zeppo does well in a comparatively straight role, letting the gags bounce off him without resorting to mugging of any kind. Groucho lets go with the sort of insults (some of which are pretty mean natured) that would give Don Rickles pause. Harpo and Chico do their usual gags with great aplomb.The classic mirror scene has already been praised to the skies. Edgar Kennedy with his slow burn has a few very good scenes with the boys, especially the one with the peanut stand and the lemonade.But it's a tough choice between this and A NIGHT AT THE OPERA for my Marx Bros. favorite. Some jaunty background music would have helped put over the laughs better in many spots--in other words, a little too much silence in the background (the mirror scene, for example) makes the viewer aware he's watching a relic from the 1930s.I can understand the enthusiasm by rabid Marx Bros. fans but I can see why the film may not have been the instant hit with audiences when initially released. Screwball comedy became even more of an art form after DUCK SOUP and has remained so.The most interesting thing about watching a Marx Bros. film is waiting for the reactions (often as funny as the gags themselves) of Margaret Dumont. She's at her best here, playing the grand dame with great skill and good humor. DUCK SOUP wouldn't be the same film without her.",

I get where the humor was coming from, but it just was not funny to me. There were enough scenes that did not feel as if they belonged at all; mainly the peanut stand scenes. Also the fourth Marx brother was the most plastic performer there. Harpo was the best and would not have minded seeing more of his type of humor, but it just felt so out of place with the rest of the movie. The fact that it was short saved it from getting tiring, but it still dragged for me. I liked how the mustache was painted on. The fact that they got me a few laughs gives it a few points and then also the fact that they tried a few political jabs was interesting, but overall I felt more than a little disappointed.

Meanwhile zillionaire matron Dumont is the dubious prize. Naturally, the boys comically foil every plot to snatch her away. Trouble is words don't come close to capturing the non-stop lunacy of the 70-minutes. What's generally overlooked, however, is how well produced the feature is. The royal hall is huge, well decorated, and staffed with armies of costumed extras. Thankfully, Paramount cut few corners and it shows. And catch that mass scene of squirming bodies near the end that borders on a surreal even as the routines continue. Comic highlights include the famous mirror scene, getting hats on straight at the hotdog stand, and Groucho's many throwaway lines. I can just imagine what it was like trying to direct this madness from a director's chair. Whatever they paid McCarey, it wasn't enough.Anyway, the boys are in top form including the uncertain Zeppo before he wisely became a Hollywood talent agent.

Firefly as president. But is he really the right man for the job ...This is one of the best films of the thirties, one of the greatest comedies ever made and my favourite Marx Brothers movie. It differs from their others in that it has no romantic leads, no piano/harp interludes or any other interruptions - it's just sixty-eight minutes of unfiltered lunacy and the gags, puns, pratfalls, one-liners and satire just keep coming. Some movies do not age well, but this oldie (seventy-five years at the time of writing) is timeless and hilarious; its mix of bizarre jokes and social dysfunction scenes anticipates post-modern comedy (e.g. Monty Python's Life Of Brian) and is a hoot from start to finish. Trust me, if you don't find this film funny (like my wife) you really need to stop taking life so seriously. Groucho is just the perfect joker here, with his non-stop nonsense monologues, razor-sharp cutbacks and charming whimsy (\"Go, and never darken my towels again !\"). Chico and Harpo are both wonderful as the Sylvanian spies, and Calhern is terrific as the stiff-backed, exasperated Ambassador Trentino. Perhaps the funniest performance of all however is Dumont; she is fabulous in almost all the Marx movies, but this is her best - she plays it just perfectly straight, a comic foil who feeds Groucho exactly what he needs, takes all his whiplash quips on the chin and comes up a trouper. Dumont always claimed she didn't know what was happening but if you really watch her here she's doing an actor's toughest job; selling comedy payoff and doing it with fabulous style. For sheer entertainment value this movie is hard to beat - it has great musical numbers, wall-to-wall laughs, a hysterical plot and some classic comedy sequences, like Harpo's incredible mirror gag. It's also a terrific potshot at every deserving institution of authority you could care to mention, which is what real comedy should always be about. Written by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby, with additional material by Arthur Sheekman and Nat Perrin. There are too many to pick from, but I think my favourite line is, \"Three men and one woman are trapped in a building. Send help at once. If you can't send help, send two more women.\".

But you can see that for yourself, so with this try let's focus on one of the two inserted comedic bits. The movie is constructed in two parts with these comedic skits tossed in. The first part is a by then conventional Marx Brothers outline written by others: a rich Dumont, a scheme, a house and theft. Songs. The other half is what they used to call madcap: the battle where all sorts of nonsensical and off- hand jokes could be pulled.By this time, the guys were already far from their Vaudeville heritage. I think their very best movies were the early ones, made in New York and based on already polished routines.But they went back to their roots in the two inserted pieces. One is a routine between two street vendors: Chico as an Italian selling peanuts and an Irish Galoot selling lemonade. It is adopted from a familiar skit and is priceless.Much more cinematic is the mirror bit. I consider this the high point in Marx humor, even though Chaplin invented the gimmick earlier. If you don't know it: all three of the performing brothers are made up like Groucho (who himself is made up). Two of them and later the third, mirror each other in a doorway which used to have a mirror.There is a lead, trying to trick the other into revealing that he is not a reflection. The delicacy of how this develops is what makes it a masterpiece. There's some simple strutting and fake outs. But when they get to the hats what they do becomes very clever indeed. It hearkens back to the vendor hatswitching but engages the audience in a way only possible in cinema.One comes out with a white hat behind his back and the other with a black which we see but his reflection doesn't. When the lead rushes to put on his white hat, his reflection miraculously has a white hat too and he points to the lead as if he were us. Its possibly the cleverest comic fold in film history.Later, of course, they start to reach across into each other's space. Good performers, especially good comics understand this notion of comic space and the problems of how to get the audience into it.If only illness hadn't messed up this act. The best comedy comes from the amount of actor's tears before the performance; the best tragedy comes from the fewest.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",

Of course, then you would miss some of the best dialog in comedy history, especially from Groucho Marx, who may be the funniest human being ever. How many other comedians or comics can you name that have excelled at both physical comedy and at telling jokes? The sight gags are brilliant and perfectly timed; a big influence on other comedies that reaches all the way to \"A Hard Day's Night,\" as well as the \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" TV series. Some of the jokes in this movie fly by very fast, so each repeated viewing reveals something new. I believe this movie bombed when originally released, but then again so did \"It's A Wonderful Life.\"",

            "content": "Marx Brothers films aren't so much about telling a story, rather they are a barrage of gags, one liners and clever vignettes. \"Duck Soup\" is right at the top of the list of their funniest and most frenetic films.In a loosely developed plot, the country of Sylvania is attempting to steal the war plans of neighboring Freedonia. Wealthy widow Gloria Teasdale (Margaret Dumont) will come to the financial aid of Freedonia only if Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) is crowned the new leader.Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo) alternately oppose and side with Firefly's cause. Straying somewhat from conventions of other Marx Brothers films, Harpo doesn't get to perform a complete musical number here, but does get to strum a few piano strings. There are some trademark Marx Brothers skits displayed here, the peanut/lemonade stand routine and the famous mirror sketch that Lucille Ball honored in one of her \"I Love Lucy\" episodes. For sheer visual delight, pay attention during the war scenes near the end of the film - Groucho's military uniform changes from scene to scene.\"Duck Soup\" is the most highly regarded Marx Brothers film. Funny it is, as was it's importance to the developing genre in the 1930's. Realizing that it doesn't work for a lot of movie fans, one should at least give it a critical try.",

I'll give two examples, one verbal and one non-verbal.(1) The peanut/lemonade stand scene with Edgar Kennedy, especially the mix up over who belongs to the three hats. It's out of Laurel and Hardy, true, but more quickly paced, fits in better with the general sense of nonsense, and Edgar Kennedy's exasperation is superbly projected. The director, Leo McCarey, had also directed Laurel and Hardy and there may have been some cross-fertilization.(2) Chico is being tried in court and is threatened with \"ten years in Leavenworth. And if that doesn't woik, we'll give you eleven years in Twelveworth.\" Chico: \"I'll take five and ten in Woolworth!\" (Kids, Woolworth's was a popular department store at the time, belonging to a genre called the five-and-ten-cent store.) I was in a meeting of the staff of a geriatric center in Philadelphia some years ago when someone commented on a suggestion, that it would \"get you ten years in Leavenworth.\" I hastily added the rest of the sequence. Everyone looked at me, and no one laughed. The moral lesson here is that humor depends a great deal on context.The context of \"Duck Soup\" is post-World War I in Europe and America, the Great Depression, the rise of National Socialism, and the impact of the Lost Generation on Western life. The First World War was begun by the assassination of an Archduke. National pride piled upon ethnic pride led to one of the most mismanaged and pointless wars of the century, an exercise in absurdity.I doubt the Marx brothers were concerned about sending a message, but in retrospect that's exactly what they did. It's like one of those humorous birthday cards that make a joke out of growing older.",

As Margaret Dumont begins to sing the national anthem after the country's entirely accidental, the Marxes pelt her with apples, a fitting fate for any knee-jerk patriot. This was one of the more extreme expressions of the American stage and screen that saw the Gershwins taking the United States into war against Switzerland over cheese in \"Strike up the Band\" and setting the Vice President up for execution in \"Of Thee I Sing.\" It's a wonder that the FBI didn't seize the film during World War II as they did copies of the Almanac Singers' \"Songs for John Doe.\" (Recall that Abraham Lincoln had Septimus Winner, composer or \"Listen to the Mockingbird\" and \"Ten Little Indians\" jailed as a subversive under his suspension of habeas corpus for writing a song criticizing the firing of Gen.

Chico is little more than an Italian stereotype. Zeppo was barely in the film. I absolutely could not stand Harpo. His mute, self-satisfied, willful destructiveness started out as just weird, but quickly turned annoying and eventually unwatchable.I would like to know what happened between the time this film was summarily rejected by the viewing public and recently when The Library of Congress placed it on the National Film Registry to change peoples' minds about it.

            "content": "Paramount Pictures' days with the Marx Brothers were coming to an end with the release of November 1933 \"Duck Soup,\" acknowledged as the comedy team's best film and also one of Hollywood's funniest movies. Sometimes adversity causes the best minds to step up their game and produce what is now a comedy classic.The Marx Brothers team was in a pay dispute with Paramount, which was feeling the financial pinch caused by the Great Depression. The studio's biggest hit the previous year was the brothers' \"Horse Feathers.\" But there were hints the four weren't going to get its salary since rumors pointed to the studio's perilous existence. Meanwhile, Groucho and Chico were doing side work on their own radio show, drawing up skits that would be incorporated into \"Duck Soup.\"A group of scriptwriters worked diligently to sculpt the basic framework of the Marx's next film. By the time the studio signed payday guarantees to them, the brothers agreed to make one more film for Paramount. One key ingredient was bringing veteran director Leo McCarey, a specialist in comedy, on board. \"I never chose to shoot this film,\" McCarey said in a later interview. \"The Marx Brothers absolutely wanted me to direct them in a film. The most surprising thing about this film was that I succeeded in not going crazy, for I really did not want to work with them: they were completely mad.\"McCarey's imprint is seen throughout \"Duck Soup.\" He came up with the famous mirror scene, showing Groucho in his nightwear seeing his reflection in a shattered wall mirror with a lookalike, Harpo, imitating his every move. The sequence took only two hours to film (silent film comedian Max Linder was the first to use this stunt in his 1921 \"Seven Years of Bad Luck.\"). Harpo reprised the act with Lucille Ball in an 'I Love Lucy' episode years later. The director also designed the Chico and Harpo's peanut vendor business as a clandestine front. The scenes of the two comedians and actor Edgar Kennedy with his adjacent lemonade cart contain a number of hilarious confrontations. The title, \"Duck Soup,\" a McCarey idea, was copied from an earlier Laurel and Hardy short he directed. When Paramount was having difficulty coming up with a witty title for the movie, McCarey figured the previous four Marx Brothers movies were named after animals. Why break the pattern? At the time, the phrase meant something easy to do. But Groucho had his own take on its meaning. \"Take two turkeys, one goose, four cabbages, but no duck, and mix them together,\" he joked. \"After one taste, you'll duck soup for the rest of your life.\"\"Duck Soup\" is set in the fictitious small kingdom of Freedonia. The citizens of the western town of Fredonia, New York, were highly upset with the coincidental association of the Marx movie. The brothers' retort was \"Change the name of your town, it's hurting our picture.\" The film's plot evolved from the satirical George Gershwin/George Kaufman 1921 musical \"Of Thee I Sing,\" which poked fun at political institutions and the politicians who run them. \"Duck Soup,\" ranked sixth highest box office film in 1933, didn't live up to the studio's expectation of a major blockbuster. As one modern-day reviewer wrote, \"At first blush Duck Soup is delightfully silly and absurdist, (but) its underlying riff-that our leaders are fools, that our institutions are corrupt, that young men and women die in wars for no reason, and that, above all, people are born to torment each other without hope of ever getting along-is as bleak and jaundiced a world view as Hollywood ever committed to film.\"\"Duck Soup\" marked the end of the Marx Brothers' employment with Paramount, concluding their free-wheeling format of their first five pictures. At the conclusion of filming, Zeppo left the quartet to establish one of Hollywood's largest talent agencies. He claimed he left because he was tired of being labeled the 'unfunny\" Marx brother. The remaining three were thinking of returning to Broadway when Chico, while playing bridge with MGM's head of production, Irving Thalberg, was approached about signing on with the studio. The brothers did, but the days of their over-the-top free-spirited productions were all but over. Wrote film reviewer Danny Reid, \"The finale marks the end of an era of Marx Brothers films, as they soon left the manic Paramount for the refined treatises of MGM where their act was to be cleaned up and, as Huck Finn may have intimated, 'made civilized.'\"\"Duck Soup's\" reputation has gained classic status over the years. Film critic Roger Ebert labeled it the Marx Brothers' best. Reviewer Danel Griffin ranks it on par with the other two great war comedies, Charlie Chaplin's 1940 \"The Great Dictator\" and Stanley Kubrick's 1964 \"Dr. Strangelove.\" The American Film Institute polled it as the 60th Best American Movie and the fifth Funniest Movie of All-Time. It's included in the \"1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die\" reference book.In an ultimate complement, Woody Allen, in 1986's \"Hannah and Her Sisters,\" has his character contemplating suicide before he chances upon a movie theater to see the Marx Brothers performing their \"Fredonia's Going to War\" musical number. The sequence gives him hope that life is still worth living. The Beatles have cited \"Duck Soup\" as an inspiration for the band's comedy 1965 \"Help!\"",

Maybe people found them funny in the 30's and 40 years after that but by now many people would have seen those jokes in Bugs Bunny's cartoons (I understand it is unfair to the movie since it was the original but they where done in a far more tasteful fashion).I regretted that I have just wasted 75 minutes out of my life watching people tried to be funny.

The movie actually has an interesting plot, involving two neighboring countries, leading up to war over insults thrown about by the character played by Graucho. The other Marx brothers play characters who are not essential to the plot but are always in the scene. There is a big musical number in the middle of the movie about leading up to war, and how the country needs to get excited about it. There is a certain parallel to the world today, as the leaders are the ones excited by war, but never have to fight in it, until it's too late. You may have never seen Duck Soup, but I know of one scene you should all be familiar with: the mirror scene. The famous duet between Graucho and Harpo Marx, imitating each other as if they are reflections in a mirror is the crowning achievement to this very funny movie.

Although I have nothing against the people who enjoyed this film, I cannot deny how terrible I thought it was. Let me explain: Firstly the characters. I have to ask, what characters? Honestly, there seems to be absolutely no character depth at all. It's just guys walking around making jokes. Take Groucho Marx for example, all he seems to do is make insulting jokes towards people. The main problem for me is that the jokes are not funny at all. And I can admit there were lines which I thought could have been remotely funny had they only been done by a funny character. Groucho's character just seems blank to me. Then there's also Harpo Marx, who simply goes around cutting things and annoying people. He doesn't even talk. I don't see how he can even be classified as a character personally.To be blunt, I found this movie boring. In just 20 minutes into the film, I felt so sleepy I had to go to bed. I wasn't tired before the movie nor should I have been. I didn't tire myself out that day at all, and it wasn't even late, but watching this film made me so bored I wanted to go to bed. I did watch this movie a couple of days later, just to see if I somehow missed the humour at the start and also to see if it got any funnier after wards. I didn't expect much, and I didn't get much. I found it purely boring and unfunny, but I did stay awake this time. Actually I didn't even get tired, but I simply must say that this movie is one of the most boring films I've ever seen.Although there is good choreography in some scenes, such as the famous mirror scene, it still lacks any funny humour. It just seems to go nowhere, and the problem is, had the characters been funny, I might have enjoyed that scene more, but as it is, I say it's quite weak. As for other scenes, well most of them are just unfunny in my opinion. This is definitely not the worst film I've seen but it may very well be the most overrated one.",

            "content": "Duck Soup is notable for being both the last of the Marx Brothers' Paramount movies and the last to feature Zeppo. But it's also notable for being - in my humble opinion - their funniest film, despite some stiff competition.\nDuck Soup, like all of the Marx Brothers' films and the Broadway shows on which several of them were based, has a loose storyline about war being fermented between the fictional states of Freedonia (of which Groucho is appointed the ruler) and its neighbour Sylvania, which wants to conquer it. And as in all of the Marx Brothers' films, this is largely irrelevant except in the sense that it provides a framework for their anarchic brand of comedy.\nIt's unceasingly funny, from Groucho's first scenes and his musical number, and Chico and Harpo's hilarious introductory sequence with scheming Sylvanian ambassador Trentino. As usual everybody apart from the Brothers (Zeppo excepted) plays it straight, which only serves to enhance the impact of their clowning; as Trention, Louis Calhern's ability to keep a straight face whilst is character is tormented by Chico and Harpo is to be congratulated. Not unusually, Chico and Harpo are frequently teamed up here, the former cracking jokes whilst Harpo provides another master class in slapstick and frequently wreaks havoc with a pair of scissors. Their scenes with Edgar Kennedy's lemonade vendor are still funny enough to make the viewer cry with laughter. Groucho meanwhile provides his usual rapid-fire stream of gags, getting some of his most quotable lines ever, and sharing the famous mirror scene with Chico. At one point, Chico and Zeppo both disguise themselves as Groucho, one silent and one with an Italian accent, whilst all four brothers come together for the famous battle at the film's climax, which must surely be one of the most hilarious endings to a film ever made.\nWhilst the film's four writers (Bert Kalmar, Harry Ruby, Arthur Sheekman and Nat Perrin) must take some credit for the film's many one-liners, few would argue that it is the delivery by Groucho and Chico that makes them so funny, whilst Harpo's inspired silent performances are a reflection of his own genius for physical comedy. But there is plenty of talent involved here, with the rest of the cast (including Zeppo) playing straight-man or woman perfectly, particularly the brother's regular collaborator Margaret Dumont as Mrs. Gloria Teasdale. Seasoned director McCarey does a great job, which is evident throughout, but particularly in technically complex sequences such as the musical number \"This Country's Going to War\" and the film's lengthy finale. He also reportedly contributed some ideas, including reviving the legendary mirror sketch from the Brothers' vaudeville show, plus the title.\nHardcore Marx Brothers fans argue that their films were never as good after they parted company with Paramount and Zeppo left the act, although the subsequent A Night at the Opera almost immediately challenges this viewpoint, even if it marks a difference in style. But Duck Soup is, for me, their cinema zenith and remains one of the funniest films ever made.",

It has Chico and Harpo as peanut vendors also insulting Edgar Kennedy as a lemonade vendor including the \"mixed hats\" routine which director Leo McCarey probably invented for Laurel & Hardy back in the '20s when they all were at Hal Roach Studios. And it has Zeppo in his last screen role before switching to the other side of show business, here performing with his brothers in his only musical number with them. Oh, and then there's the iconic mirror sequence with Groucho and Chico and Harpo with the latter two dressing like the first one. In short, it has all the ingredients of perhaps the greatest of the Marx Brothers comedies. And while I enjoy the piano and harp solos of Chico and Harpo, respectively, the fact neither do their music here adds to the enjoyment though I guess something had to be done to the piano displayed here so Harpo decided to just pluck on the strings like his beloved instrument to satisfy some of his penchant for skill playing...",

The free-wheeling plot is just a device to link their zany and irrelevant routines, and other movies far surpass this one; most of the other 'Marxist' comedies for instance. I think the highlight, for me, was Groucho's quick-change outfits in \"the bunker\". Given Margaret Dumont's wonderfully understated yet ditzy performance, that says a lot.Harpo is a delight (as always) but Chico seems flat - just going through the motions. Hmmm... perhaps Zeppo needed more exposure than he is given here.It's hard to discuss this film without including spoilers: after all, the routines are what it's all about. Still, yer pays yer money...A Night at The Opera might just be better as an intro to the Bros. All in all, however, it IS just a matter of taste.

Firefly, and the very end, in which a knee-jerk patriotic act by Mrs. Teasdale is rewarded by the Marx brothers with a rain of apples on her are a few examples) and dialog (at Chicolini's trial, Firefly declares 'This guy may act like an idiot and look like an idiot, but don't be fooled; he really is an idiot!') comedy moments of all time.This is probably the Marx brothers at their funniest; see to believe.Italian Title: La Guerra Lampo Dei Fratelli Marx (The Marx Brothers' Lightning War) Duck Soup: 9/10",

But if you didn't, then it's going to be either a hit or miss. And for me, it is the latter. Their so-called finest film probably was ahead of its time back when it was released but the time it did belong to is also long past gone.Directed by Leo McCarey, Duck Soup is a nonstop barrage of jokes & gags that hits the accelerator early on in a comedy vehicle that has no brakes. Countless imitation over the years has diminished much of its appeal and while the jokes & backhanded quotes are clever & admirable, if not as effective, there is just too much of it which in turn takes even this 68 mins ride into overkill mode.Not everything that the film throws at the wall sticks. And what's supposed to be the laugh-out-loud moments only manage to conjure a mere chuckle than pure laughter. It is unruly in structure and relentless in delivery yet the quips & routines get old real soon, plus some of them go on for too long. What also doesn't help the cause is that all the characters played by Marx brothers are annoying. Not amusing. Annoying.Overall, Duck Soup marks my first stint with the Marx Brothers brand of comedy and it probably isn't for me. The sharp wit & slick execution is noteworthy but it does lack a heart & soul. If one walks into this film without any idea of who this comedy troupe is, there's nothing in the film to make them root for the irritating characters inhabiting it. The film may still provide brief doses of laughter but it won't make them fall in love with these quirky folks.",

He is witty, talented, intelligent and funny. Very, very funny. Harpo was the musical genious (although I felt bored of him playing the harp in almost every movie). Chico is complete mayhem. Together with Harpo, they are a little comedy troupe. Zeppo... well, I don't know about him. He isn't funny at all, he seems the least talented of the brothers. Maybe they needed a straight man in their team.But mix the four together... the results are dynamite.

It's a broad mixture of high class comedy elements that were common and know back in the '30's. It basically makes this movie fun to watch for everyone, no matter what your referenced type of humor is. This movie has it all and knows to combine it into one big successful comical style for this movie.The movie features the four Marx brother's but this truly still is mostly a Groucho Marx. He really plays the lead role of the movie, which perhaps sort of goes at the expense of the talent of his brothers but he perhaps also was the best of the bunch, so it's not as if the movie suffers from his central presence. Also the rest of the supporting actors are good and are definitely comfortable with the genre. The movie for instance also features Edgar Kennedy, who is best know for his roles in the Laurel & Hardy movies, often as a cop.What also mostly surprised me about the movie was its look. Back in the '30's most money was not spend on comedies and they were often simple and cheap made movies. But this movie has the same good and expensive look as an '30's swashbuckler, so to speak. It has good big looking sets and some nice costume design.Well, of course the movie its story is rather simple and predictable. It also isn't truly original and so aren't the situations and characters really. It all had been done before in past comedies, for instance by Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton and this is the only reason why I just can't really give this movie a perfect 10 out of 10 rating. However the execution of it all still makes this an highly original and effective genre movie to watch.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Groucho is such a cultural icon that, like Charlie Chaplin, he inspires warm nostalgic feelings in movie buffs even if you've never seen one of his movies.However, that said, I have to assume that \"Duck Soup\" is the Marx Brothers at their zaniest best, and it is very funny. This is the film that includes the famous \"mirror\" scene, in which two men in a doorway becomes a hilarious comedic bit, as one man thinks he's looking into a mirror because the other is matching his actions and gestures.

            "content": "I'm sorry to say this, but this movie is kinda overrated. When you compare it to the other Marx Brother's films; it's not that funny. Honestly, in my opinion, the only reason why this movie is well-remember, is because of the memorable mirror gag. The concept of the mirror gag isn't new, at all. After all, Charlie Chaplin used a similar joke in 1916's film, the Floorwalker. While, this might be the best known appearance of the joke, the rest of the film doesn't live up, in value. Directed by Leo McCarey, and set in the fantasy bankrupt world of Freedonia, Duck Soup tells the story of the country leader, Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx) declaring war on neighboring bankrupt Sylvania, so that he can win, the love of wealthy widow Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont) in a last ditch attempt to keep his country afloat. Without spoiling the movie too much, I found the premise to be, very jarring. I can understand, why this movie didn't do so good, during the Great Depression. Audiences at the time, were taken aback by such preposterous political disregard, buffoonery, and cynicism at a time of economic and political crisis that many didn't bother to see it. A lot of those people didn't like how the movie compare nationalism to a minstrel show. The satirical depiction of Freedonia is said to have led then, Dictator Benito Mussolini to ban the film in Italy. Despite that, the movie wasn't a box office bomb as some people saw it. It did pretty well, despite mixed results from critics and trouble production. Although this by itself, did not end the group's business with Paramount. Bitter contract disputes indeed, did the group in. After the film was done, the Marx Brothers and Paramount agreed to part ways. Despite playing different characters with different names, the Marx Brothers are pretty much, playing their stereotypical stage act selves in their roles. There's Groucho that has the anarchic wise guy with the drawn-on moustache. He has some of the funniest zingers, insults, and comebacks. His chemistry with Margaret Dumont are some of the best. Then there is Chico who plays likable Italian stereotype in every role. He has some funny bits, here. Then, there is Harpo, the mute, childish, slightly annoying one, there for kid appeal. Sadly, this was the last Marx Brothers film to feature Zeppo. Zeppo knows for playing the traditional straight man, quit movie acting, overall, due to being the butt of jokes regarding him as the \"unfunny\" Marx brother. Anyways, don't look for anything new from them. They just going with what talent, got them to the show. The movie story isn't that great as well. It's often very complex, and doesn't make any sense. I know that war was still a profitable business, back then, but how is having a bunch of people kill each other, over a silly reason, supposed to be funny? It's doesn't sound, funny. Anyways, it gets more confusing, when Harpo and Chico are found to be spies for Sylvania, but they able choose to fight for Freedonia, instead. It's hard to tell, where this movie is going for, between the spies business and them, trying to anger another street vendor. Also, why were they acting like dicks to that street vendor!? It's not like, he did anything wrong to them. Don't get me wrong, there were some funny moments. I did like how film pokes fun at the Hays Code by showing a woman's bedroom and then showing a woman's shoes on the floor, a man's shoes and horseshoes. Then it cut away to Harpo sleeping in the bed with the horse; the woman is in the twin bed next to them. That was somewhat funny, but overall, it was really dated humor. Another problem with this film is the musical numbers. The musical numbers, didn't really match well with the rest of the story. The first musical number in the film that accompanies Firefly's first day in office really wasn't needed, and felt too similar to the one that introduce Groucho's character in 1932's Horsefeathers. I didn't find it to be the worst. The worst had to be; the trial scene turning into an absurd musical number. That was really out of place. It wasn't really funny, it was just really odd. Anyways, breaking with their usual pattern, neither Harpo's harp nor Chico's piano is used in the film. Although Harpo briefly pretends to play harp on the strings of a piano, strumming chords in accompaniment to a music box that is playing the unlikely chime tune of 'Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf\", \" from rival studio, Disney's Three Little Pigs, released the same year as Duck Soup. The songs got even worst, as the movie went on. One line in a variant on the old Negro spiritual 'All God's Chillun Got Wings' was cut out, from the film's current DVD release, due to its offending nature to African Americans. In my opinion, it's a product of its time, and should had been kept in the film. I just glad, the DVD didn't felt like censoring any more scenes. Anyhow, most copies of the film are pretty good copies. There are hardly any grains or film dirt in most DVDs. The DVD releases are in HD and worth checking out. It has tons of special features, worth watching. Overall: While, it's not quite as good as its predecessor. This is still a highlight in the Marxian filmography. It's a must watch",

I laughed at almost every scene, as this is the Marx Brothers best combination of quips, puns, political satire and physical sight gags. They are in prime form and for the first and only time, are directed by a real director ... Leo McCarey (also known for An Affair to Remember, and Going My Way). The script is from Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby, with additional dialogue by the great Arthur Sheekman.Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo star together for the last time, as Zeppo decided to join brother Gummo on the business side. Groucho plays Rufus T Firefly who is (somehow) named as the new leader of Freedonia, the bankrupt country backed by millionaire widow Mrs Teasdale (played by Margaret Dumont). A childish spat between Firefly and the ambassador of Sylvania lead the two countries to war. Of course, in between, there is a huge musical production sequence and too many funny gags to keep track of.The film is recognized as the first political satire film and was released just 3 years after the death of silent films. Much of the film is spent as commentary on the absurdity of war and ego involved in most conflicts. A couple of the iconic sight gags include the famous \"mirror\" scene with Groucho and Harpo, and the hilarious \"hat scene\" with Chico, Harpo and silent film star Edgar Kennedy (as a lemonade vendor). There is also one of the most bizarre early special effects (a tattoo on Harpo's chest) and a Dallas, Texas joke that generated applause from the audience. The film even pokes fun at the Hays Code (morality censorship) with a shot of a pair of men's shoes, a pair of women's shoes, and a set of horseshoes, and then a quick cut to twin beds and an odd sleeping arrangement.The film came out at a time when much cynicism existed toward the Great War and the Depression was still a fact of life in the U.S. Because of that, the film may be easier for us to watch now than it was at the time of its release. Even the Freedonia anthem, which is played several times throughout, is a spoof on the Star Spangled banner with it's only line being \"Hail Hail Freedonia, land of the brave and free\".Support work is also provided by Louis Calhern, but it's Margaret Dumont who never ceases to amaze. A consistent presence in Marx Brother films, she is the epitome of the \"comedy straight man\". How she ever played her role seriously given the Marx Brothers hijinks is beyond belief. She even gets to flash her classically trained singing voice, though it provides a flying fruit ending.The Marx Brothers made 13 movies and this was their fifth, and probably best. The five brothers only appeared together on screen one time ... on a TV talk show in 1957. Their vaudeville and stage act continued to be the basis for their films, and was undoubtedly a factor in their incredible comedic timing. While it is understandable that the Marx Brothers humor may not be to every person's taste, it is impossible to ignore their impact on film comedy. Hail Hail Freedonia!!",

            "content": "This concentrated dose of typically manic Marx lunacy is widely considered to be the high point of the brother's career, and it isn't difficult to see why. The daft (and incidental) storyline has Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) becoming ruler of Freedonia at the behest of Mrs. Gloria Teasdale (the redoubtable Margaret Dumont), who has been financially bailing out the principality for years and who has something of a soft spot for Firefly. The oily Ambassador Trentino of Sylvania (Louis Calhern), however, also has designs on Freedonia and Mrs. Teasdale, and before long the two nations are at war.The Marx Brothers brand of comedy is something of an acquired taste, and this inspired lunacy is probably the best introduction possible to their work. Although poor Zeppo is still hanging around with nothing much to do (this was his last film), the musical numbers are short and kept to a minimum, and the pace never flags. Some of the sight gags perpetrated by Harpo and Chico \u2013 especially when tormenting the hapless Edgar Kennedy \u2013 are so fast that you are left as surprised as Kennedy is when he finds himself carrying Harpo's leg while trying to retain hold of his hat. I remember loving the Marx Brothers as a kid, but I was always a little wary of Harpo: those staring eyes and mute grins still put me in mind of a malevolent clown. In the real world his childish antics would earn him a swift beating, but in the world of the Marx Brothers he survives every (often mean-spirited) prank unscathed. While Harpo's abuse is physical, Groucho's is verbal. Both are relentless, and both leave their foils speechless with indignation. It's a routine that could quickly go stale were the quips and one-liners not so expertly written and delivered. And there never was a better foil than Margaret Dumont, with her pained reactions, and her unfailing ability to miss the fact that she is the butt of Groucho's jokes.The film contains a wealth of classic moments, including the oft-copied mirror sequence in which Harpo, made up to look like Groucho, mimics his actions as he stands in a doorway and pretends to be a mirror reflection. The most sublime touch comes, not with each (mostly) well-timed mime, but when Harpo, copying Groucho, whips a white hat out from behind his back. Harpo points and laughs, but he's laughing at us as much as Groucho, because we saw that the hat was black when he originally walked into view and he knew we were expecting his ruse to be discovered when the hat was revealed. It's the subtle touches such as these, so far ahead of their time in the early thirties, which mark the Marx Brothers as one of moviedom's few acts of comedy genius.",

Duck Soup is a brilliant piece of comedy that doesn't demand much thinking, but it itself has brains.What could the plot of a film called Duck Soup be about? War, apparently. And smartasses. And buffoons. Honestly, the best thing you could do to prepare yourself for this film is to not care about the plot because it's not important. The plot practically plays out like an elementary school drama game, where everyone in a circle adds one word and a story is formed. This is not a detriment: the dialogue and actions are the star here.Before this I had never seen a Marx Brother film, so all the ideas here were new to me, and there's a good chance they're new to you. Three Marx brothers (Groucho, Harpo, and Chico) play well-developed serial characters: a smartass, a mute, and an Italian stereotype (the relative \"straight\" character) and they're hilarious. Especially since everything else in the film plays like a plain-ol' film, these ridiculous personalities stick out like a sore thumb. Firefly's one-liners and general attitude are a clear precursor to Alvy Singer in Annie Hall, and Pinky's obsession with snipping and flamethrowers is really charming and funny. Here the two pillars of comedy are covered, physical and word. Chico is in the middle, dipping his feet in both ideas.I don't want to spoil any of the gags, but they come fast and often. Maybe even too often, as you'll definitely miss a few. There's not exactly a big commitment here either: the film is just over an hour long, and is as nonsensical as the title from start to finish. I was thinking of World War I allegories throughout, but afterwards I read a comment by Groucho, essentially saying its just for jokes. So be political if you like, but here is a comedy that has as little brain as it has brain. It'll make for a fun hour. 8.3/10",

If the brothers map to Freud's view of the parts of the human psyche, Harpo is definitely the id. His humor comes out of left field from a place of mayhem and anarchy (him taking scissors to pretty much anything he can get his hands on comes to mind), and the fact that he doesn't speak makes it all the more primal. Not all of the jokes in the script land, but many still do, and there is great range as well. At the suggestive end of the spectrum little is filtered because the film was pre-Code, and there's even a little jab at the unenforced guidelines when a horse is shown in bed with a couple. Through all of the craziness and despite Harpo saying years later that \"We were just four  trying to get a laugh,\" there is a sophistication and a message to this humor.",

            "content": "Surely one of the most famous if not the most famous comedy team ever the Marx Brothers star in whats considered their masterpiece. This was the first Marx Brothers film I ever saw and it made me want to see all the others. But when I came to this movie I really wasn't sure what to expect, as such i'll write this comment for those of you who have never seen a Marx Brothers film and hopefully it will encourage you to see it.First off yes of course it looks a bit dated (being over 70 years old!) but the restored DVD is better quality than expected. The humour however has lost nothing in fact some lines are delivered so dead pan and quickly that you find something new to laugh at nearly every time you watch. Each Marx brother has a distinct personality and type of humour which sparks off the others, Groucho has the one liners, Chico the zaniness and Harpo the physical comedy and just plain weirdness, Zeppo is the straight man (who barely features in this his last film with the brothers).The plot is at times seems irrelevant just a framework to hang the zany gags off, but strangely there can be seen some definite commentary under the humour. At times it feels like a Loony Toon cartoon come to life and this is just as timeless. The one liners hit the mark every time the slapstick is hilarious and the zaniness never overpowers. If you've never seen a Marx Brothers film before please do as it really will make you laugh like no other. It's also fun to see just how many people this has influenced, just about everyone who followed was inspired by the antics of the Marx Brothers 8/10 - Possibly the best comedy ever? Maybe it's up there with the best, Monty Python and The Holy Grail, Airplane etc.",

It is more anti stuffed shirt than anything.This film is the nearly perfect blend of physical comedy & verbal comedy.

            "content": "Simply quacked, \"Duck Soup\" is the BEST Marx Brothers film. I could have said 'quintessential' and 'exemplary' or 'most classic' and 'most defining', but sophisticated epithets are so tremendously ostentatious and since I consider superlatives as the worst reviewing tricks ever, the word that still best describes my feeling is 'best', and by 'best', I mean 'funniest'. And my case I rest.Now, is there a recipe that justifies the ecstatic comments put in this \"Duck Soup\"? What are the ingredients, the cinematic gourmets might ask? Well, I guess it's just so irresistibly funny that it stands on its own regardless of its status as a 'Marx Brothers' film. The film is purely, objectively and outrageously funny, with as only reason-to-be: fun, fun and fun again. I don't think it's possible to be that hilarious with the plain intention of being funny; the movie works because there is a mood of sheer anarchy that inhabits all the protagonists, a sort of desire to destruct and deconstruct that creates all the comedic force of the film. The Marx Brothers are the 'Schumpeters' of comedy.Not that it bothers me, but I'm not sure I am being clear while writing these lines, but this is probably because I was already questioning the relevancy of a review for a movie like \"Duck Soup\", before writing it. Think of it, if you have seen the film, you know it's the funniest of the 'Marx Brothers', and by 'funniest', I mean 'best' but that's the problem: if it's the first time you plan to watch one of their films, starting with \"Duck Soup\" condemns you for many disappointments. Not that the others films are bad, some of them are great even by today's standards, but none of them can beat \"Duck Soup\" on a zygomatic scale, for one simple reason: \"Duck Soup\" is funny from beginning to end. The Marx Brothers are the 'Stakhanovs' of comedy.I guess the fans will understand where I'm coming from: \"Duck Soup\" is the only film that doesn't feature the classic sappy romantic subplot, or a musical interlude. Both \"Duck Soup\" and \"A Night at the Opera\" made the American Film Institute's Top 100 but on the comedy department, \"Duck Soup\" is far superior because it doesn't waste its time: every frame, every scene and sequence exists only for pure comedic purposes, with a vis comica that could have defeated Attila's men if it was converted to a military force. \"Duck Soup\" is certified 100% pure Marx Brothers, and works like 100 push-ups. The Marx Brothers are the 'Schwarzeneggers' of comedy.\"Where is your husband?\" \"Why, he's dead.\" \"I bet he's just using that as an excuse.\" \"I was with him to the very end.\" \"No wonder he passed away.\" \"I held him in my arms and kissed him.\" \"Oh, I see, then it was murder. Will you marry me? Did he leave you any money? Answer the second question first.\" This rapid-fire exchange between Groucho Marx as the newly chosen dictator of Freedonia Rufus T. Firefly and Mrs. Teasdale, Margaret Dumont as the irreplaceable dignified matron doesn't exceed fifteen seconds, which makes one joke every four seconds, yet it's so fast-paced that just when you laugh at something another one comes at you, and your mind is so challenged it's impossible to focus on the movie's brilliance.Take Margaret Dumont, who plays with a remarkable professionalism the straight-man role, legend had it that she never got the jokes. Well, Groucho's delivery is so quick that she's forgivable, and his humor so subtle that even I is still scratching my head to the obscure \"Gentlemen, you're fighting for this woman's honor, which is more than she ever did\" joke, although I'm not sure I got it, I get why it is funny, and I think this is the key to understand the genius of Dumont's performance. She might not get some jokes, but she got the fact that she's being verbally assaulted and that she contributes to the shining Groucho's talent. While \"MASH\" was clearly mean-spirited, \"Duck Soup\" provides an elegant way of making fun of someone which almost sounds as flirting when you consider the great chemistry between Groucho, the heavy-weight champion of comedy and Dumont, his priceless sparring-partner.But let's not forget Harpo and Chico, all of them at the top of their game, Zeppo is still not the most memorable character of the bunch, even dethroned by the villainous Trentino (Louis Calernh), the movie provides every possible type of humor, from slapstick to idiotic idiomatic puns, from verbal jokes to pure parody, the film is like a laboratory of joviality, where the four brothers are left with enough freedom to let their creativity explode to the face of the Earth: playing xylophones on soldier's helmets, providing unforgettable musical numbers, from the poor street vendor victim of the hat-changing routine to another running, or let's say, driving gag, one gag follows another, punctuated by totally random (but still hilarious) moments like when Harpo sleeps with his horse, when a dog emerges from his tattoo. There are no limits for absurdity and twice during the film, it culminated with cinematic genius. The Marx Brothers are the 'Einsteisn' of comedy.The first is the mirror scene, probably the 'insert an ecstatic superlative' Marx Brothers moment. When Chico, disguised as Groucho, puts the right hat (while he was seen with another) you could see in their eyes, the innocent joy of two brothers simply having fun. The second is the mayhem 'archive footage' sequence showing the 'coming help', a moment still hilarious after almost eight decades. \"Duck Soup\" is so modern it can be considered as a landmark in the field of comedy just like \"King Kong\" was a masterpiece from the same year was for visual effects.And don't let yourself be fooled by the film, it might look and sound idiotically funny on the surface, but it really is.",

            "content": "That was what Groucho Mark said when asked about the political nature of the picture Duck Soup, how much thought was put into its construction as the ultimate anarchic comedy. And it's not unfair to ask- though it's a perfectly reasonable and unpretentious answer- since Duck Soup seems to be such a work of insane brilliance that it defies explanation. Maybe it is best not to explain why things were done this way or that. The movie works almost like a cocktail of dreams and hallucinations on war (at least the last 20 minutes), and also features some of the best gags and jokes ever put to film. If you asked me where I took a breath from laughing I would be hard pressed. There's not a moment in this movie that is not at least a little clever, or awesomely bad-pun-esquire, and indeed there's many moments where I continued to laugh after a joke happened just in wondering \"how the holy moses did they come up with that?\" Duck Soup is the epitome of the sound comedy (at the very least before color); no stone is unturned, no insult is not given out by Groucho, no word is twisted around for the sake of a big laugh by Chico, and no piece of, well, clothing or whatever is left un-snipped by Harpo's scissors. In the dissection of dictatorships and war as a function of the human condition (yes, I'm going there describing it like this), the Marx brothers take it down to a fundamental level: what makes all of this tick, and what makes it funny? Or what makes it so that one can see without any fog at how insane it already is? It's like the Marx brothers top the inherent insanity given in human beings who reach power over the people and can go to war with whomever they like, by just, frankly, being themselves. It's hopefully the greatest compliment to say that a lot of what happens in Duck Soup comes off so effortlessly by the three/four brothers.Then again, there must have been a lot of effort put in by the brothers and the writers, and whatever mess it may seem to turn into by the time the war stuff happens (or just that musical sequence in the courtroom right before they go to war, a possible high water mark as far as laugh-a-mili-second musical scenes go). So many quotable lines come from every direction (just to put two out there: \"Remember, you're fighting for this woman's honor, which is probably more than she ever did,\" from Groucho and \"Mint? No, no, I no like a mint. Uh, what other flavor you got?\" from Chico when asked about a job in the Mint) that it's hard to keep up, so hard that it probably demands repeat viewings. While it's given to say the mirror scene is classic, which it is, lest not forget a masterful near-pantomime with the hats at the peanut stand, or some 'tiny' gags like making a \"record\" of events being a vinyl and tossed in the air to shoot.There's so much in the ether that it makes it an overwhelmingly rich experience comically, even in just 68 minutes. It's also always in the spirit of fun, or whatever can get a laugh, and that takes some guts. Screw a \"story\", why not just have Harpo make a stop while doing his \"Paul Revere\" at a woman taking a bath in a house and then winding up in the bathtub with the husband (?!) Why not have Groucho make his entrance the backward way down the pole to where everyone else is giving the GRAND entrance, as he holds out his cigar for, um, himself? Why not have the cavalcade of footage of \"reinforcements\" near the end? Why not break out into a song or have a bunch of unrelated cultural gags (\"Taxes!\" \"Texas?\" \"No, money, dollars!\" \"Yeah, Dallas Texas!\")? Why not just go completely bug-f*** nuts from time to time and make the audience not even sure what's exactly a joke or a gag or a goof or something ironic or (dare it happen) poignant? The Marx's answer: Why, OF COURSE! Duck Soup is a masterpiece, no if's ands or buts. HAIL FREEDONA!",

            "content": "It's possible to argue that this line from Duck Soup - and a later parody of minstrel songs - were attempts to satirise racial stereotyping. After all, Groucho's line was a nonsensical reference to a hit song of the same year, highlighting the absurdity of such a song.What is perhaps harder to argue (though frequently is) is that Duck Soup is any kind of political satire. As Groucho himself famously said, the brothers were \"just four Jews trying to get a laugh\". While the film does serve as a political farce, many of the targets seem to be touched upon by proxy, the movie's real purpose being only to keep viewers amused.This is where Duck Soup admirably succeeds, as a continuous stream of good to great material is served up by Groucho (the funny, wise-cracking one with the moustache), Chico (the slightly less funny but likable one), Harpo (the deeply irritating one) and Zeppo (the er... other one).However, one thing that must be noted is that the pace to the Brothers' films are often a little out of kilter by modern standards. The brothers work well together, but the guest cast never seem to be able to quite keep up with Groucho's machine gun approach to telling gags. As a result, every one liner is followed by an awkward pause as he waits for the others to catch up. The timing could have been trimmed in the editing suite, but it would have left a vastly shorter picture.Without a wholly satisfactory climax - this still in their pre-MGM, freefalling days - then the film does seem to abruptly end somewhat, leaving one to wonder how it has come to be regarded as an all-time classic of cinema. It's an excellent film, no doubt, and a very funny one, but its journey from initial mixed reviews to modern day canonisation is sometimes a little puzzling.",

Firefly) as dictator.

He employs peanut salesman Chico Marx (as Chicolini) and mute pal Harpo Marx (as Pinky) as spies. Taking advice from handler Zeppo Marx (as Bob Roland), \"Firefly\" leads the four Marx Brothers to an all-out war.When \"Duck Soup\" failed to stir up the box office to the levels expected, Paramount and the Marx Brothers parted company. But, there were other reasons for this relative failure. Today, \"Duck Soup\" is unmistakably Marxist, but at the time, it then bent the structure from what audiences expected. This was neither the staged antics of \"Animal Crackers\" nor its cinematic relative \"Horse Feathers\" (1932). The scaffolding of Marx Brothers, which could be seen coming, was now fairly obvious: Groucho was most important, Harpo and Chico were next, with the underrated and underutilized Zeppo downgraded to insignificant.Why not a duck? Perhaps, the biggest reason \"Duck Soup\" lost viewers may have been its satirical stance on war. At the time of release, its particular anti-war satire was a touch subversive, and not well-received. Over the years, however, this film became most critics' favorite. See it, but don't think you've seen all there is to see of The Marx Brothers herein. \"Duck Soup\" was brilliantly conceived with help from director Leo McCarey with writers Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby. It was (arguably) their third film peak, and the end of an era.

It failed at the box office, and many reviews here at IMDb, mostly from people who never saw a Marx movie before, are not very positive.This all makes sense if you think about it. Duck Soup has an unusually high tempo, several very well done scenes. The plot is questionable, but Marx movies are not about plot. But with that tempo, you really need to be used to the Marx concept. If you are, you will have a really good time.But if you are not so used to Marx, I would say that the ones to start with are \"A night at the opera\" or \"A day at the races\". The latter was my favorite as a child, and even after watching all Marx movies, they are still on par with Duck Soup for me.Duck Soup is a good comedy, but I don't think it deserves to be called the best of all time. My prime alternatives for that prize are The Great Dictator, Monty Python and the Holy Grail and The Blues Brothers. The Great Dictator is really the one to compare to, also being a political comedy.

There, he also insults the ruler of the neighboring country of Sylvania and starts a disagreement that may end in the two countries going to war. Naturally, everyone wants the dirt on Firefly and thus two gentleman (Chico and Harpo Marx) are chosen to spy on the new leader. Chico opts to run a peanut stand just outside the government mansion, bothering Firefly so much that he offers Chico the position of secretary of war. Chico is glad to oblige, stating that he wants a standing army \"so that we can save on the cost of chairs.\" Harpo is always hanging around, too, trying to break into safes and get the scoop. One night, they all end up in nightshirts, nightcaps, and big black moustaches, mixing things up nicely. Firefly also holds government meetings where a member of the cabinet wants to take up the topic of tax. Firefly says they should take up the carpet but the man insists they \"take up tax (tacks) first.\" Firefly concedes this to be necessary. As war looms, the trio prepare themselves for battle. What will the outcome be? Everyone probably has their favorite Marx brothers film and this one, despite the silly plot, should appear on many a list of their best works.

Indeed, this satirical masterpiece about war proved to be a turning point in the career of the brothers. After \"Duck Soup\" performed poorly at the box office, Paramount declined to renew its contract with the zany quartet. Straight guy Marx brother Zeppo bailed out of the act to become a talent agent, while the remaining trio\u2014Groucho, Chico, and Harpo--found a new home at Metro-Goldwyn Mayer\u2014with wunderkind producer Irving Thalberg supervising their antics. Basically, Thalberg took the sting out of their chaotic comedy by turning them into comic relief for a young romantic couple in dire romantic straits. Previously, the Brothers had dominated the narratives. Now, they became hosts to less luminaries, and their humor lost its tangy flavor. According to Thalberg, the Marx Brothers not only lacked sympathy but they also alienated female audiences. You won't see Harpo thrusting his thigh into a girl's hands like he did in their Paramount releases. Mind you, the next two Marx Brothers' films--\"A Night at the Opera\" and \"A Day at the Races\" are very funny, but neither film is the madcap hilarity of the Paramount Marx Brothers' escapades.Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby wrote both the hilarious screenplay and the songs. Some of the verbal jousting is classic. At one point during a cabinet meeting, Rufus says that only a four-year old could make sense of some gibberish and then he urges somebody to find him a four-year old. The plot in a nutshell involves the affluent Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont) who refuses to lend any more of her millions to the postage-stamp sized bankrupt country of Freedonia unless they appoint Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx) as their leader. Groucho is late to his own coronation when Mrs. Teasdale spots him in the ranks. Naturally, Rufus gives Mrs. Teasdale a sarcastic dressing down with puns galore. Meanwhile, the rival European country of Sylvania and its scheming ambassador Trentino (Louis Calhern of \"The Magnificent Yankee\") want to take over the country. Trentino sends in two spies Chicolini (Chico Marx) and Pinky (Harpo Marx) to dig up incriminating information about Firefly that will sour Mrs. Teasdale on him. The gags are some of the best, particularly the oft-imitated mirror pantomime routine where Groucho and Harpo in sleeping gowns confront each other in an archway and try to fool the other into believing that they are cavorting in front of a mirror. The first scene when Chicolini and Pinky meet Trentino in his office is a laugh riot of puns, one-liners, and sight gags. If you consider yourself a Marx Brothers' fan, you must see this imaginative 68-minute classic. Any seasoned Marx Brothers devotee will spot the absence here of Harpo playing his namesake and Chico on the piano.",

SYNOPSIS: The story, if one can call it that, concerns Dumont (who did seven of these with the Brothers) as a dowager millionairess who will donate $20 million to the destitute duchy of Freedonia if it will agree to make Groucho (Rufus T. Firefly) the dictator. NOTES: Zeppo's last film. He retired to become an agent. Groucho, Chico and Harpo's last film for Paramount. Irving Thalberg induced them to sign with M-G-M where they started off with one of their biggest contemporary hits, \"A Night at the Opera\" (1935). Although \"Duck Soup\" was not all that popular when first released, it proved a tremendous hit in the U.S.A./Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia, when it was re-issued in the early 1950s. By the mid- fifties, it had become a top cult movie in all four countries.COMMENT: Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby didn't receive any encomiums for penning this three-laughs-a-minute script and these delicious mock- opera songs in their M-G-M \"biography\", \"Three Little Words\". Surprise, surprise! Their most famous film too \u2014 and easily the marvelously anarchic Marx Brothers' best. McCarey and his astute film editor have pruned the film so that only the funniest routines and most hilarious wisecracks remain in this zippily paced spoof of all things Ruritanian. Produced on a lavish budget, with stunning visual images to match the sharp soundtrack, \"Duck Soup\" is one of the few cult classics that fully deserves its highest reputation as an endless cornucopia of fun.OTHER VIEWS: \"I'm going home and clean the crackers out of my bed. I'm expecting company,\" explains Groucho in Leo McCarey's naughty, nutty spoof of politics and international diplomacy. A merciless satire, enlivened by the sexiest dialogue and situations. Raquel Torres wears the lowest-cut gowns ever displayed on the vintage Hollywood screen. \u2014 JHR writing as George Addison.AVAILABLE on an excellent Universal DVD.",

It's all about them, the gags and jokes which are a constant stream in this movie.Duck Soup has elements of political satire but it's mostly just crazy fun.

            "content": "The Marx Brothers were among the best comedy entertainers of their time and beyond. They were gifted musicians as well as comedians. Their comedy included dialog with one-liners and zingers, zany antics, slapstick and acrobatics. Some of their movies are among the funniest and best comedies of all time. Many sources regard \"Duck Soup\" as their best film. I don't, and here's why. This film was still early in their movie careers and strikes me as raw and unpolished. It has many lines and routines that seem right out of vaudeville. Indeed, the long scenes with the peanut vending come from a vaudeville act that the brothers recreate in a couple of movies. There's nothing wrong with the variety performances of vaudeville, except that today they are old hat and just not as funny. And many of the one- liners are so old that they too lack humor today. The long scenes of costumed players singing the Freedonia anthem lose their humor after the first one or two. \"Duck Soup\" seems to me to be a succession of skits held together by the thinnest of plots. Plots aren't necessary for great comedy, but then the comedy must be able to stand on its own. I just don't think \"Duck Soup\" has the comedy that does that. One last thing that bothers me about this film is the insult in some of Groucho's lines. It goes overboard here. As an aside, this is one of the few of the brothers' big films in which they don't perform musically. Their musical talents were surely of professional level and when they played in their other films, they added a little something to the story \u2013 and even to the mayhem at times. I rate \"A Night at the Opera\" as the best Marx Brothers film, and one of the greatest comedies of all time. Close behind it is \"A Day at the Races.\" Those films differ considerably from \"Duck Soup\" in that they have interesting serious plots that make for much more laughter with the zany scenes. And, they have much better developed dialog with witty lines and wonderful zingers. In the place of silliness (slaps in the face, verbal insults, etc.) that pepper \"Duck Soup,\" those films spend a little time with plot involving other actors. That makes the comedy all the more hilarious in the scenes that follow. \"Duck Soup\" may be the silliest movie the Marx Brothers made. But it's not the funniest by a long shot. Nor is it their best, in my view.",

It's still not my cup of tea in terms of the comedy though, as it's just an endless assault & barrage of \"listen to me, this'll be funny\" & \"watch this, it'll be hilarious...\". I like some physical comedy, but this is ridiculous. There are some elements of set pieces that were quite good, but they're so damned smug about it. I've watched 2 of their films now & I have zero desire to see anymore. Instantly slapable, & not for any 'slapstick' reasons, just endlessly irritating & annoying.

While much of the humor is stuff that could be achieved as easily if the Marx Bros were live on a stage, some humor is dependent on how it was shot and edited. Take for example the brief joke late in the film, when Groucho mentions that they need more soldiers as most have been killed. He says people are out recruiting new enlistees this very moment. The shot cuts quick to a shot of Harpo from the back, as he carries a sandwich-board that reads \"Join the Army and SEE the Navy\". this joke wouldn't work without the film editing and it's something I don't see much in comedy films of this period. The Marx Bros liked to push the envelope, and the film makes great use of as many types of comedy as possible.",

            "content": "I recorded this off TCM many years ago and put it on DVD. I know it's been a long time since I watched it-there were parts that I totally did not recall ever seeing. I think that I kept it because it is so often called the best of the Marx Brothers and I figured I'd like it more on another viewing. Tonight was the night.Now I loved Groucho Marx on You Bet Your Life, and the big hits of the late 1930s-A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races were tremendous movies. There was a lot of silliness, but there was a real purpose in the actions overall. As a huge fan of Get Smart, Green Acres and even Burns and Allen, I love silly comedies in general.In Duck Soup, a rich woman named Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont) has given millions to the country of Freedonia, and she is willing to give them another $20,000,000 to help them out of their current crisis, but only if they oust their prime minister and install Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) as their leader. They agree.Ambassador Trentino from a nearby rival nation wants to wed Mrs. Teasdale ( a widow) but Rufus is also sweet on her. He will use this as a means to take over Freedonia. He sets spies-Chico and Harpo-to find out anything he can use to take Rufus down. His plan is to get him disgraced, even if it means going to war. It seems every time he tries to romance Mrs. Teasdale, Firefly interrupts.Finally Trentino makes Firefly mad enough to slap him. This means war. Then they patch up the quarrel and everything is going to be fine. Firefly says he doesn't even remember what it was that he was called that made him so mad. In a friendly way, Trentino recalls what he said, and Firefly slaps him again and once again we are bound for war.After a long and pointless song by a cast of hundreds of Freedonians, the war begins. Firefly changes uniforms as often as we get a camera shot of someone else and come back to him. He goes from an American revolutionary war general to a Confederate general to a Union corporal to a boy scout to a fur trapper to a drum major.People love to talk about two big comedy scenes-one at a lemonade stand, the other where Harpo and Groucho are dressed alike and mimicking each other as though one thinks he is looking at a mirror image of himself, while the other is fooling him into thinking so when there is no glass. There was some cleverness there, but there were enough actions not properly copied to make it clear there is no mirror, yet they kept on going as though they didn't notice. I kind of think Lucy and Harpo did it better on I Love Lucy.As for the lemonade scene-actually three scenes , Chico and Harpo had a peanut stand outside the palace and a lemonade stand was next to the peanut stand. The guy operating it (Edgar Kennedy) objected when they chased away one of his customers. Despite being bigger and more physically fit-looking than the Marxes, no matter how much they annoyed him-even to the point of destroying two of his hats-different times-he never struck them, just shrugged his head in disgust. There was a later scene where Kennedy came home while Harpo was talking to Kennedy's wife. He hides in the bathroom, but as Kennedy comes in, he tells his wife he's going to take a bath. We next see him sitting in a bathtub when he detects something is wrong. Suddenly appearing out of the other end of the regular-sized bathtub is Harpo, literally blowing his horn even while still underwater! Now this is the sort of cartoonish thing you might expect from Looney Tunes. Who on earth could climb into a regular tub and not see, or feel, that there's another full-grown man already in the tub? Too silly-stupid to be funny.Throughout the movie, Harpo kept whipping out a pair of scissors and clipping things in half-cigars, candles, feathers, whatever. He clipped the tails off a man's longcoat and kept clipping all sorts of things-with no point to any of it.There was a barrage of one-liners and silly answers that I guess were the stock-and-trade of Vaudeville. Some of them were kind of humorous and reminded me of lines Hawkeye Pierce used to say on MASH. But we never had a MASH episode where he did that for the whole 25 minutes. We had more than 25 minutes of this in Duck Soup. Those non-sequiters and suggestive jokes were the bulk of this film.One example had Harpo riding a horse-a la Paul Revere-then seeing a pretty girl through a window getting undressed for bed. He rides his horse right into her house and is seen chasing her in her room. Then we see his boots lying on the floor, with the camera panning to the right, we then see her shoes, then four horseshoes. The next shot shows a bedroom with the girl sleeping in one bed, and Harpo and the horse in the other. They could suggest sexual things then, but couldn't go too far.For all the people who think this is one of the funniest movies ever-more power to you. I just found myself bored as most of the film was leading nowhere. There was no point to most of what happened other than to be silly. One example: Firefly was ordering someone to go out and buy some trenches for the war (that would be quicker than digging them) and he told them to make them this high. (holding hand about chest high.) Then he changed and holding his hand near his neck, said, \"Make them this high and they won't need pants.\" Then he held his hand up over his head and changed to \"Make them this high and we won't need soldiers.\" Frankly, if his finance minister had delivered the last part, it would have been funnier. Either way, it wasn't much.I understand this bombed at the box office, which is why it took a few years for the brothers to make another movie. When they came back they had their best films because there was a purpose to most of the action, with the sheer silliness limited to selected scenes.Here, it seemed like from 5 minutes in, they were talking and singing about going to war until the last 10 minutes, when they showed the war-sort of. And there was never a real reason for a war, but we'll prattle on and on about it for almost an hour. My final score for a film with just a few funny scenes that was largely annoying is a 4 out of 10. I know I could get more laughs out of any three episodes of You Bet Your Life.",

            "content": "I have finally seen this film (actually bought the DVD for $9 at the mall), and while I was raised on Monty Python & newer movies, I can honestly say that \"Duck Soup\" is as good as everyone says.  You can't go into thinking as if you're going to see an Eddie Murphy movie or a modern (nastier?) movie. This movie was made in far different times from what we live in today; a divide that's wider than the almost 70 years that separates it from us.  I believe there is even a racial joke or two about \"darkies\" to further date it.  But other than that, Groucho is still the master of the one-liner & put-down and slapstick humor has never gone wrong since the first caveman slipped on a banana peel.On another level, the film shows an evily sarcastic look at the politics of war (e.g. insults leading to war and mass destruction).  From the similar era, the Gershwin's & George Kaufman gave us the musicals such as \"Of Thee I Sing\" and \"Let 'Em Eat Cake\" which also showed us the absurdity of war & politics (albeit at a more cerebral level than the Marx Bros.).  But in this day and age of presidential \"scandals\" and trumped up election results it's refreshing to take a pause and think that 70 years ago people seemed just as willing to doubt their politicians and even war (especially since this film & the Gershwin musicals falling between two so-called \"just\" wars -- so that even Ira Gershwin had to rewrite \"Strike Up The Band\" to have less offensive lyrics for WW2).Also, as a modern note, \"Duck Soup\" played a part in a great practical joke on latter-day politicians via \"Spy\" magazine.  They called up various politicians in DC and asked them \"What are you going to do about the ethnic-cleansing in Freedonia?\"  As you can expect, they fell all over themselves saying either \"we should work hard to stop it, send troops\" or \"we should not get involved\" etc.  Nobody asked \"Where is Freedonia?\" which of course exists only in \"Duck Soup!\"",

That surely doesn't mean that they were perfect, but they were talented and their films emanated creativity with impressive stunts, ingenious gags and highly entertaining musical numbers. While Duck Soup's plot is something obviously built for comedy, it's somewhat exaggerated or rather the played down tone on politics, funnily enough, enhances the viewing experience. There's just something so exhilirating about watching a politician being portrayed as a buffoon, and perhaps oddly satisfying. It's a genious satire that begs to be further analyzed in retrospective, and a bit sad to see that not much has changed since the old days.The absolute highlight is the mirror scene, I would recommend anyone to watch this movie just because of that scene. I wouldn't recommend watching the scene in isolation because it's better when you understand the whole context, the payoff is way better. It is one of the most accomplished comedic scenes in the history of cinema, without a shred of doubt. Extremely well-crafted and wonderfully executed, the film is also notable for having a wonderful sense of comedic timing and delivery from dialogues that are remarkable still to this day.I must say I particularly didn't enjoy much of Harpo Marx's interventions, there's something about him that just throws me off.Anyway, when you watch this film you will know exactly how the Marx Brothers skillfully operated just to make people laugh.

            "content": "I think that all the work of the Marx Brothers, Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton is really worth watching, since their most famous films, their masterpieces to the minor works and their short films. After watch and love all the feature films of Charlie Chaplin (with the little exception of A King in New York) and some of his short films, I really had desires to watch something of the Marx Brothers and Buster Keaton. A week ago I saw my first Buster Keaton film, The General (Clyde Bruckman and Buster Keaton, 1927), and yesterday I saw my first Marx Brothers film, Duck Soup, and I really enjoyed it.The situation in Duck Soup is simple: Freedonia has a new leader (Groucho Marx). Sylvania wants to have Freedonia \"under their flag\" and for that they send two spies (Harpo and Chico Marx) to try to find something compromising about Rufus T. Firefly, new leader of Freedonia.If we have Groucho as that new leader, well we should ask why. The issue is that Freedonia was in crisis so they needed millions from Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont) but she has one condition to give them the money: they need to name Rufus T. Firefly as the new leader. Is a really fine and really hilarious performance of Groucho but definitely Firefly is an annoying person and the ambassador of Sylvania, Trentino (Louis Calhern), is the one that is going to suffer the most Firefly's personality and all can and will end in only one thing: war, a pointless war (pleonasm).The other bros, Harpo and Chico as Pinky and Chicolini, are as annoying and crazy as Firefly. This two are just hilarious but more with a physical humour (Pinky, Harpo's character, never talks) and they made truly memorable sequences in this film. As Trentino is suffering with Firefly, a lemonade vendor (Edgar Kennedy) will be really suffering with both spies that soon will be together with Firefly. The result of this is my favourite sequence of the entire film; yes the mirror sequence with three Grouchos! Magnificent. But war is there (hilarious to see after the last try for peace of Mrs. Teasdale how Firefly for a simple supposition ends with the last hope for peace) and another memorable sequences and the final part of Duck Soup.Finally, I just loved my first Marx Brothers picture. Duck Soup is short (65 minutes), hilarious (many great dialogs and stuff to list them all) and a really unique war film that has the absurd reasons of a war as a background. I highly recommend this film to anyone! Show this one to your family!",

Firefly, played by Groucho. \"Why, a four-year-old child could understand this report,\" he says. \"Run out and find me a four-year-old child; I can't make head or tail of it.\" This is not a musical in any true sense of the word, but there are plenty of familiar tunes and obscure musical references to satisfy your curiosity about how well these zany comedians have held up over the years.

            "content": "Duck Soup is a movie that is nearly ninety years old, yet it remains more relevant than ever thanks to the buffoonery that is present in the world's political spectrum. The movie, the Marx Brother's best, is hilarious and feature some prominent visual gags. Groucho Marx did say they were not aiming to create a political satire, but they did so anyhow. The brothers were pleased when Benito Mussolini, the Italian fascist dictator banned this film in his country. The plot is silly and flimsy, but the brothers do what they do best to carry the movie-to make people laugh and laugh until they cry tears of laughter.This film was to be the last film the Marx Brothers made with Paramount. The studio was going through some costly restructuring and the brothers feared they would not get paid for their work. Thankfully, their contract dispute ended, and they were able to get the film to work. This film is also the last film that the fourth brother, Zeppo worked on. He was more of the straight guy, the more superfluous brother when compared to the other three.As with most of their films, this film took inspiration from their stage and vaudeville acts. Their visual gags have always been popular, and the characters seem to be straight out of silent-era comedies. That said, Groucho and his perfect way of delivering zany lines of dialogue would fail miserably during this period...well, because there was no sound. One of their biggest stage acts was the mirror trick. Director Leo McCarey came up with the idea to incorporate this act into the film. It was done flawlessly. Harpo Marx dressed up as Groucho and perfectly imitated each other in a long, magnificent sequence. Physical comedy was also part of their act, and once again was put to good use. This time, Harpo and Chico harassed a lemonade vendor. It was hilarious and it proves why the brothers are comic legends.It may be fruitless to describe the plot because its flimsy and complicated all at once, so I shall only deliver the gist. Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx) is named new leader of Freedonia at the request of wealthy benefactor, Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont). At his inauguration, he insults everyone. The person who gets the brunt of these insults is Ambassador Trentino (Louis Calhern), from neighboring Sylvania. Trentino sends his two spies, Pinky (Harpo) and Chicolini (Chico) to gather information on Firefly. Regardless, the insults from Firefly will lead to war between the two nations.The brothers are on fine form here. Groucho continues delivering hilarious wit line after line. Harpo and Chico do very well with their physical comedy as we see in the lemonade stand scenes. Too bad they did not play their instruments, because I hear they generally do so in their movies. Zeppo, the straight man, plays Groucho's secretary Bob Roland and does a solid job.The musical scenes are great! I loved that Freedonia's national anthem, which we hear every time Groucho walks into a room, is a ripoff of \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" While I did enjoy the film from start to finish, I'm grateful it is only an hour and ten minutes long. I felt the film began to lose steam towards the end during the war scenes. That said, these scenes featured some excellent comedic gags. Namely, the uniform switching. Groucho could be a Union soldier, or a Confederate soldier, or heck even a soldier under Davy Crockett's command.If you want to be introduced to the Marx Brothers, start with Duck Soup. Their first MGM picture A Night at the Opera would be a solid choice if you do not mind some cheap, unbelievable romance. There is none of that here. Just some relevant political farce that would work extremely well in today's world given our political climate. I laughed. I smiled. I had a great time! So should you.My Grade: A-",

            "content": "When I started watching this movie, I expected it to be great, to be funny as Charles Chaplin's movies, but, I was to a great extent disappointed.This movie is not funny enough, Marx brothers' acting is amateurish, and exaggerated. the plot is poor, quite a lot of scenes seem meaningless and unnecessary, just trying to make fun, and worse still, they are not funny at all, just abrasive gags. I only managed to get two smiles out of it - one, the tattoo scene, two, the mirror scene - that's all. Some scenes even look outlandish, for instance, the one when Marx brothers lift their legs in the air, followed by other people, is not funny but weird, as if they were dogs trying to pee.If you are expecting to see comic brilliance and intelligent satire in Duck Soup, please, skip this movie, because you will see lots of abrasive gags instead.If this movie is not considered as one of the IMDb top #250, and one of AFI #100 films, maybe I just watched it for 45 minutes, instead of watching it to the end, in my opinion, Duck Soup is NOT deserving of it's IMDb and AFI's top rating, this film is overrated and the hype surrounding the film seems unreasonable.I feel sorrowful that I have just wasted 68 minutes out of my life watching Marx Brothers tried, in vain, to be funny. If this film is Marx brothers at their best, I certainly won't watch their other movies. If this film is Marx brothers at their best, then Charles Chaplin is too much for Marx brothers, for Charles Chaplin's films are done in a far more tasteful fashion.I rated Duck Soup 3 out of 10, 3 is given to its political satire, which is the only merit of this movie. Well, out of respect for movie-makers, I'm not generally against any movies, but this time, I'm afraid I have to put Duck Soup on my all-time worst movies list. ===================================== Tell you what, after I wrote the comment above, I did not send it immediately, 'cause next I was going to watch another Marx Brothers' movie - A night at the opera. And A night at the opera is way better than Duck Soup, Marx Brothers showed their comedy talent in A night at the opera. If you wanted to know how Marx Brothers are, then go for A night at the opera, skip Duck Soup. maybe Duck Soup is Marx Brothers at their worst.",

            "content": "I first saw some Marx Brothers material no less than twelve years ago. I remember seeing a lot of \"The Big Store\", and maybe some others, but don't recall finding it too amusing. Of course, I was under ten years old at the time, so my tastes have obviously changed since then, and \"The Big Store\" is not considered one of their classics, whereas \"Duck Soup\" is. So, I'm not one of those who can say I grew up with the Marx Brothers, but I have now seen this classic of theirs. I was hoping for some good, hard laughs, and without a doubt, that was what I got!Mrs. Gloria Teasdale is a rich widow in the country of Freedonia. This country is in a poor financial state, and she promises to lend twenty million dollars, but only on condition that the current leader of the country steps down and lets Rufus T. Firefly take over. As a result, Firefly becomes the new dictator of Freedonia, but unfortunately, the country's new leader is an extremely uncouth one who goes his own way, making bizarre decisions and not doing his country much good! Meanwhile, two spies, Chicolini and Pinky, have been sent from the neighbouring country of Sylvania. In addition to that, Firefly and Ambassador Trentino of Sylvania are both in love with Mrs. Teasdale, which causes a rivalry between the two, a rivalry which will lead the two countries to war unless they work something out!This Marx Brothers effort starts off a bit shakily before any of the four brothers come in, without much humour, and Margaret Dumont's (Mrs. Teasdale) overacting is a bit much. However, it certainly gets funnier when Groucho Marx (Rufus T. Firefly) first appears and starts his chattering! The film becomes sidesplitting not long after Chico and Harpo come in as Chicolini and Pinky! After this, lots of hilarity follows, with some stupid but priceless dialogue and slapstick (hilarious lines often provided by Groucho at a rapid pace), and Dumont fits in with it, playing a character who constantly has to put up with Firefly! There are so many classic moments in the film, including the ones involving Pinky and Chicolini (especially Pinky) giving the peanut vendor a hard time, Rufus slapping Ambassador Trentino, the mirror scene, and many others!Overall, \"Duck Soup\" is classic comedy that has aged well. I also think it's fair to say that it's intelligent political satire. While it may not be as popular today as it was upon its original release in 1933, it can still be very appealing to fans of slapstick and comic stupidity! Clearly, it takes comedic geniuses to come up with the kind of lunacy that's pulled off in this Marx Brothers hit! The Marx Brothers' demented style of comedy is obviously not for everyone. In fact, I'm sure some would hate it. We all have our own tastes. So, if comic lunacy isn't your idea of funny, then avoid, but if you like the Marx' style of comedy, then \"Duck Soup\" is a great movie to watch, guffaw over, and never forget!",

Basically the small country of Freedonia needs rescuing for bankruptcy, and eccentric, cynical and sarcastic dictator Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx) is elected the new president so that Mrs. Gloria Teasdale (Margaret Dumont) will donate $20 million. Firefly refuses to act on politics like a professional would, for example he reduces workers' hours by shortening their lunches, he almost treats the country he now runs like a toy. To make more people appreciate him he attempts the same idea that the Ambassador Trentino of Sylvania (Louis Calhern), to marry Mrs. Teasdale. Unfortunately the two leaders declare war on their countries because they won't settle this fight over the rich bird, Mrs. Teasdale's house is victim to these attacks. Also starring Harpo Marx as Pinky, Chico Marx as Chicolini, Zeppo Marx (in his final appearance) as Lt Bob Roland - Firefly's Aide, Raquel Torres as Vera Marcal, Edmund Breese as Zander, Leonid Kinskey as Sylvanian Spy-Agitator #1 (as Leonid Kinsky), Charles B. Middleton as Prosecutor and Laurel and Hardy's Edgar Kennedy as Bald street vendor. It probably is a good idea that I see it again one day, as I can't remember much of it, apart from some good one liners, and it is quite often heralded as the most popular of the brothers' films, it is certainly a comedy film I wouldn't not see. The Marx Brothers were number 20 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, the film was number 85 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, it was number 40 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films, and it was number 5 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs.

I wish all four of them continued to make more movies (Zeppo would soon leave the group). What I like about this film is the musical numbers are few (and when they do occur they're quite funny instead of mere filler).The movie takes place in the country of Freedonia. They're in a border rival with Sylvania. The president of Freedonia (Groucho) is facing a nationwide debut and a sluggish economy. Groucho woos a rich dowager in an effort to solve his country's financial woes. But the representative of Sylvania keeps on blocking his advances towards the dowager. With his pride insulted, Groucho hires two double agents to spy on Sylvania. Can Groucho win the dowager's hands? Will Chico and Harpo be unmasked as double agents? Will the two countries go to war? There's only one way to find out. Watch Duck Soup! You wont regret it!I loved this movie. It has to be my favorite comedy of all time. You can't go wrong with this one.

            "content": "I've seen this movie a few times, and I laugh consistently through the entire thing every time. And yet, I've never loved another Marx Brothers movie nearly as much as this one. I really do enjoy Monkey Business and the others, but none of them get nearly as much of a reaction from me as Duck Soup. I've often wondered why, and taken this post as an excuse to figure it out.JuxtapositionOne thing that makes comedy tic is juxtaposition when we expect one thing and get something else. This is the woman who looks crippled suddenly standing up and doing a silly dance. We wouldn't expect the woman to move, but less do something so out of character, and that difference between expectations and reality can be a source of laughter.Duck Soup has that in spades. Read the below summary:\nIn an imagined country called Freedonia (probably European), the government is dealing with a massive financial crisis and has been relying on a sole benefactor to prop up its government in such trying times. That benefactor will only give more money if they follow through on her desire to put a specific man in power as president. The country's elites agree and this man proceeds to get the country into a war with it neighbor Sylvania for petty reasons.That story seems to have the makings of a political thriller, or a grand sweeping drama.Instead, it's used to provide a setting for antics like this:The number itself is good, but I think it's really enhanced by the fact that it's about something so serious as war. This silly display has no place when talking about taking a nation to war, but here are the anarchic Marx Brothers doing just that. (Another great example of this sort of thing is \"Springtime for Hitler\" in Mel Brooks' original The Producers and its treatment of Nazis).OutrageousnessIs the humor from the Marx Brothers' outrageous? Sure, Groucho's one liners can get a bit raunchy at times (the Motion Picture Production Code didn't start enforcing censorship until the next year, 1934), but nothing, out of context, should send people to fainting couches. However, I would say that considering the subject matter of the film's story, the humor itself is outrageous in the best of ways.This is being told by scolds what one might or might not say about what should and should not be respected or insulted, thumbing your nose at them, and doing it anyway with glee. \"You can't make fun while people are dying with horrible weapons of war!\" one might say a decade and a half after the greatest and most destructive loss of human life the world had ever seen. \"Corruption in government is a serious matter and cannot be made light of!\" scolds another.Groucho, Harpo, and Chico look at the speakers, stick out their tongues and just keep on with the anarchy (Zeppo is off to the side trying to start a romance no one cares about with one of the hecklers).It's the very fact that this humor is being done at the expense of serious subjects that it works so well, better than any of their other movies, I think.On the surface, it's just a silly musical number about very little as Groucho mugs about in his own fashion, but if you actually listen to what he's singing, it's borderline horrifying. Here are the opening lyrics:These are the laws of my administration\nNo one's allowed to smoke\nOr tell a dirty joke\nAnd whistling is forbiddenThat's the first thing Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho's character) says he's going to do: oppress speech and actions that he himself enjoys (much like Kim Jong Un). Here's the rest of the song:Rufus:\nIf chewing gum is chewed\nThe chewer is pursued\nAnd in the hoosegow hiddenChorus:\nIf we choose to chew we'll be pursuedRufus:\nIf any form of pleasure is exhibited\nReport to me and it will be prohibited\nI'll put my foot down, so shall it be\nThis is the land of the freeThe last man nearly ruined this place\nHe didn't know what to do with it\nIf you think this country's bad off now,\nJust wait 'til I get through with itThe country's taxes must be fixed\nAnd I know what to do with it\nIf you think you're paying too much now\nJust wait till I get through with it*Whistle*I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair\nI'm strictly on the up-and-up, so everyone beware\nIf any man's caught taking graft, and I don't get my share\nWe stand him up against the wall and pop! Goes the weaselChorus:\nSo everyone beware, you're stricken or unfair\n---unless he gets his shareRufus:\nIf any man should come between a husband and his bride\nWe'll find out which one she prefers by letting her decide\nIf she prefers the other man, the husband steps outside\nWe stand him up against the wall and pop! Goes the weaselChorus:\nThe husband steps outside, relinquishes his bride\nThey stand him up against the wall and take him for a ride.He's singing about oppression, murder, punishing the people of the country through heavy taxation, and that he's going to be the most corrupt person in the country. I don't think that the Marx Brothers were trying to \"say anything\" with this movie, but if they were, then I think this number is the strongest example of what they might have been doing. Put a song and dance on terrible policy, and people will just sing and dance along.Take that out of context, and it's horrifying. Throw it into a literal song and dance number while everyone cheers on, and it becomes hilarious.War, Marx Brothers StyleOne final note before this lovefest is over. The final ten minutes or so of this 70 minute film (it really is that short) is the war between Freedonia and Sylvania.Again, you see the conflict between the seriousness of the surrounding action (an actual battle) with Groucho's priorities. He wants help, but if he can't get that, send women.The sequence goes on with further absurdity as Groucho ends up changing outfits (completely inexplicably) several times, showing off an impressive array of audacious military outfits, often with large feathers.Perhaps the movie works so well for me because of the limited run time of 70 minutes (apparently Zeppo did have a romantic subplot which got cut, thankfully as they always drag down Marx Brothers films). It doesn't overstay its welcome. It has its anarchic fun and bows off the stage like a good vaudevillian act should do. No matter what, though, I love this movie completely and love to revisit it pretty frequently.",

Well I'm pleased to announce that the Marx Brothers were definitely on the right track (IMO). I remember their old films being shown on TV when I was young and I also remember finding their mad-cap humour very entertaining. It was interesting to see them again quite a few years later to and still enjoy them just as much. Here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts.Rufus T. Firefly has been appointed ruler of the cash-strapped state of Freedonia. This tiny country's benefactor, Mrs. Gloria Teasdale, believes passionately in Firefly's abilities. The ambassador of the neighbouring state of Sylvania, Trentino, wants Mrs. Teasdale's money and will go to any lengths to get it. He has one problem though, Mrs. Teasdale only has eyes for Firefly and to this end Trentino sends in his spies, Chicolini and Pinky. This only causes more mayhem and Trentino ends up insulting Firefly who challenges him and it all ends in a declaration of war! Mrs. Teasdale tries to calm things down but they are determined to fight. I'll leave it there so as not to enrage the Spoiler Police.Of course the stars of the show are the Marx brothers; Groucho Marx as Rufus T. Firefly, Harpo Marx as Pinky, Chico Marx as Chicolini and the lesser known Zeppo Marx as Lt Bob Roland - Firefly's aide-de-camp. They are ably supported by; Margaret Dumont who is excellent as Mrs. Gloria Teasdale, Raquel Torres as Vera Marcal and Louis Calhern as Ambassador Trentino of Sylvania.Now, as a coherent story with a narrative, it's all over the place, but I believe this is deliberately done to keep the story moving. Of course, the story is just a means to get to the next one-liner, or sight gag, but it kind of works. Looking deeper into it, the film has quite a satirical message about wealth and power. I really enjoyed it, there were elements that you might see in a more modern Mel Brooks film and some of the routines are truly great, particularly the mirror scene. Over all, recommended.My Score: 7.5/10",

I believe it is one of the very best the boys had to offer, although Groucho always maintained the more mainstream work done at MGM was better. But what stands out in DUCK SOUP- as in the other Paramount films the Brothers did- is the rootsy, East 93rd street Jewish kid effrontery that governed everything the guys did in vaudeville and on Broadway. Here, in this marvelous anti-war farce, you'll see Harpo at the top of his form in the sight gag, with ongoing battles with Edgar (\"Slow Burn\") Kennedy. Margaret Dumont, Raquel Torres and Louis Calhern are on board playing the straight man in the midst of the Marxian chaos. And there's no beating the mini-musical that introduces the final war sequence towards the end of the film. On a more personal level, this work kept me alive during one of the worst years of my life, and it still buoys me up in some pretty stark moments. Maybe it can do the same for you.",

This is what I enjoyed about the film. The only problem I found with this film was that it was slightly too short - they could have easily fitted in one or two more good jokes. Ah well, I am grateful for what the makers DID produce! :-)In this film, there are two countries near to each other, Freedonia and Sylvania. Freedonia has a new leader, Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx) and he makes things complicated for both Freedonia and Sylvania, with his rather odd manner (you will understand when you watch this film). Hilarious political capers commence...I recommend this film to people who like funny films of any type, people who like crazy films, people who like humour with a mixture of (primarily) slapstick and wittiness and people who like watching films for historical interest.

The Movie Never Seems to Drag or Stall and has a Momentum All Its Own and that is, It Never Stops Moving.Someone, Somewhere, Sometime Probably did the Math and Figured Out that Duck Soup has More Laughs Per Minute than Any Other Film Ever Made. If No One Did, They Should, and If It Doesn't, the Math is Wrong, Because This is One Funny Film.The Subject, a Satire of War, is Alone Worth the Price of Admission. One of the Few Musical Interludes is a Swinging, Jazzed Up Minstrel \"All God's Chillun Got Guns\" (cut in some versions), and Groucho Makes a Joke About a Popular Song of the Time \"That's How Darkies Were Born\". The Point is, that the Marx Brothers were Never Politically Correct or Reverent and Duck Soup is Full of Their Edgy, Sometimes Nasty Humor. Maybe More than Any of Their Films. It Never Capitulates Like \"Opera\" for Others to Perform or to Lessen the Bite. So Overall, if One Had to Choose the Best Marx Brothers Movie, the Recommendation is Duck Soup for Everyone.",

Why it bombed has never been known, but this was a political satire and the country was still dealing with the Great Depression. Also there was a war raging in Europe. People went to movies to escape and this probably would have reminded them of what was going on. It wasn't until the 1960s that this was rediscovered and rightfully became a comedy classic.This is virtually non stop jokes and slapstick. There are no silly romantic songs or subplot to slow the movie down and (thankfully) Chico and Harpo don't have their harp or piano solos. There are many classic scenes including the mirror bit.

            "content": "I just finished watching Duck Soup for the first time ever. Though I am 82 years removed from that time and culture I still laughed quite a bit at the craziness going on. There is something about this era of comedy movies that I really like and the comedians like Abbot and Costello, Laurel and Hardy, Charlie Chaplin, The Marx Bros., and my favorite The Three Stooges. These guys were the pioneers of the jokes and slapstick in the early days of film that would eventually become clich\u00e9; however in their time it was cutting edge and original.Someone else said that if somebody turned out movies like this in the '90's it wouldn't be funny or sell. Of course it wouldn't be funny because it would have been comedians of the 90's doing clich\u00e9 acts. Sometimes there are moments in history where all the factors are only applicable to that exact time period and they would not work in another era if debuted for the first time e.g. silent films being made today exactly as they were in the 19-teens or 20's will not be your biggest seller at the theater. But the generations of the future can look at the past and respect the work that was done because it paved the way for the efforts put forth in modern times. Comedy of the 90's (or any decade) that will stand the test of time will be that which is original and clever. Ghostbusters or Goonies of the 80's is an example of original material of that decade still popular today. So in the same vein Duck Soup is a classic of the 30's, but not only that, it is a classic comedy in the annals of film history.The Marx Brothers just mesh really well together and the lines that are delivered were just hilarious, like when Groucho says, \"You know you haven't stopped talking since you got here. You must have been vaccinated with a phonograph needle.\" Harpo just did some weird stuff and it seemed absolutely random, like using scissors on everything. There was some quick wit coming from these guys that just worked well. All of the random acts that would happen just kept you guessing and wondering what is going to happen next. This kept the movie unpredictable in some areas. Some jokes were predictable, but that is because they have been used so many times since then.I wonder what it would be like to see this for the first time in the theater in 1933. It probably would have been far funnier to me. I think this will be one of my new favorite classic comedy films. If you have a little over an hour to spare, I highly recommend just sitting down and watching this funny piece of history.",

In their classic movies, they cleverly go from one antic to the next in perfect harmony. The harmony is missing, here. The humor is still good, however. The plot involves a zany nation much like the later \"The Mouse That Roared\", with lots of zany actions. People who only see this Marx Brothers movie shouldn't judge the others by this one. They are famous for movies in which they look like all out blitz defenses. This is more of a prevent defense at the end of a game. If you watch their other movies, you'll note you're attacked with clever gag on gag, endlessly, and it is hard to catch a breath. In this movie, they seem to struggle more and try to do formula humor, which they are good at. The Marx Brothers were the most gifted comics of all time (arguably).",

Nowhere else are the brothers' strengths deployed in such effective tandem, with Groucho's lecherous misanthropy clearing a channel for Harpo's horny berserkitude and Chico's forehead-smacking wordplay. Dumont is at her irreplaceable best too.

            "content": "My prior experience with the Marx Brothers has been less than I care to admit, limited to a few clips of 'You bet your life' and 1946 feature film 'A night in Casablanca.' I enjoyed these, surely, but was not prepared for what I would get as I began watching 'Duck soup.' This is Groucho, Harpo, Chico, AND Zeppo in their cinematic prime, clearly reveling in the robust comedy they'd already perfected through years of live performance and a handful of previous pictures. I'd be curious to know what the budget ultimately looked like for this, as the movie is filled with many extras, fabulous costume design, considerable effects, and notable set pieces. More than that, add to these elements many sight gags, some physical comedy, hefty helpings of satire - and a boatload of witty repartee and outright absurdist humor. I don't suppose it would be for everyone, but this is such a wonderful good time, I can't readily imagine anyone not liking it.Each of the Marx brothers are at the top of their game here. Groucho and Chico are astoundingly fast-talking and smart as whips in their dialogue, Harpo is a marvel in his joyously cartoonish, clownish mischief-making, and Zeppo is a blast in his contrast as the \"straight man,\" heightening the hijinks of his brethren. Beyond the siblings, common Marx collaborator Margaret Dumont is a delight as she plays off their energy as Gloria Teasdale, prolific early comedic actor Edgar Kennedy makes a big impression in his tangential role as an unnamed lemonade vendor, and Raquel Torres and Louis Calhern fit neatly alongside their fellow cast members as Vera Marcal and Ambassador Trentino, setting up the plot. I can only imagine that \"work\" aside, each day of production had to have been so much fun - a brilliant cavalcade of laughs as actors and crew alike feed off the inescapably cheerful romp.The screenplay is terrific, filled with wickedly quick and cutting dialogue and enthusiastically exaggerated characters. Hand in hand with these, the scene writing and overall narrative are carefully crafted to sustain the greatest of jocular vigor, while also pointedly lampooning musicals of years past, politics and the operation of governments, war, and so much more. And Leo McCarey's direction is just as keen and capable, extracting the full potential from all involved. From writers to filmmakers, from technical craft and rounding details to performances - every last aspect of 'Duck soup' is simply splendid, and fantastically funny. All parts here are geared strictly towards the utmost wild farce, and with that it handily succeeds in providing tremendous entertainment. It's hard to write more without betraying details - I heartily recommend 'Duck soup' to all comers as a highly enjoyable slice of comedy gold that easily holds up decades later.

            "content": "\"Take two turkeys, one goose, four cabbages, but no duck, and mix them together. After one taste, you'll duck soup for the rest of your life.\" - Groucho Marx's explanation for the title of Duck Soup.Duck Soup is an unprecedented comedy of wit and satire, with its range of material and jokes reaching a rare amount of diversity. The film is short, whimsical, and delightfully anarchic at only sixty-eight minutes, and it seems after every ten minutes you need a break to sometimes decipher what just happened. Things progress at a rapid fire pace, and the end feels like about twenty-five minutes or so got lost in a blaze.This sounds like how I'd comment on a bad film, but Duck Soup uses these tactics in its favor. Its main benefit is that the brothers wanted to do nothing more than make an enjoyable comedy, but they accidentally succeeded in making one of the most cynical and brutally honest political satires in a blue moon. It's very rare that I award a comedy a perfect rating, but Duck Soup has proved to be more than meets the eye in substance, character-acting, and overall, look and feel.We are placed in the country of Freedonia, a small, corrupt, and bankrupt place that has struggled politically for many years. Mrs. Teasdale (Dumont) suggest they appoint Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) as the leader of the country, and see if he can get the country back on the route of prosperity. It's clear that his plans are radical, unsustainable, and virtually outlandish. The funny part is no one sees it that way. He says that anyone chewing gum will be pursued, and despite how absurd that idea is, no one scolds him. They are too smitten with his sunny and kind-hearted disposition. Perhaps that's how we are as people.While this is in the mix, the neighboring country of Sylvania has been itching to take over the land of Freedonia, and the Sylvanian ambassador Trentino (Calhern) attempts to destroy the country bit by bit by hiring two spies to dig up dirt on Firefly, and further tries to implement and carry on with a revolution. The spies he appoints, Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo), are incompetent buffoons who wind up being unnecessary roadblocks and distractions, bringing trouble wherever they show up. This results in a never-ending slew of comedic possibilities, all working in the film's favor.Next to Rufus, the funniest character is Chicolini, the silent half of the spy duo, who appears in some of the film's most enjoyable segments. There are a number of scenes where Chicolini and Pinky obnoxiously harass a poor street vendor who wants nothing but a successful business. This results in the infamous scene where the three tirelessly exchange hats, and where Chicolini jumps into and rides the bucket of lemonade like a bicycle, disgusting the vendors' customers. The scene is simply hilarious, and I can't recall laughing harder to a scene in a comedy in recent years.But what makes Chicolini's character avoid insufferable schtick is his ability to perform physical comedy. His facial expressions are simply entrancing and his antics on par with his explosive personality. He's almost like Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean, but more shameless and rowdy. Chicolini has an intense and infectious form of likability, and he never comes off as a nuisance.Duck Soup was released in 1933, and was met with less than stellar box office numbers, causing Paramount to drop The Marx Brothers, among other issues. The most likely reason it took in a low amount of revenue is because of the subject matter. The film is highly cynical, sarcastic, and unapologetically rude. America was hitting the time of The Great Depression, among the beginning stages of World War II. It goes to show that people weren't interested in seeing a cheeky, satirical portrayal of government and politics. Thankfully, the film has gotten its proper respect over the years, and is often hailed as The Marx Brothers' best film.I also wouldn't hesitate to bill this as one of the funniest and smartest comedy films ever made. At least on my personal list. The film tackles a number of subjects, from politics, imperialism, government, outlandish rules, and society itself, and satirizes them to the point of utter disbelief and hilarity. In no way is the film mean-spirited or deliberately crude. This was before that became the standard in comedy. It always keeps a sunny, cheery disposition, right down to the final frame. Its bravery is astonishing, even to this day. How often do we see comedies tackle difficult subjects, let alone with so much confidence, power, and pride, never becoming indulgent, cocky, or simply crass and ignorant? This is comedic and satirical filmmaking at its absolute finest. The Marx Brothers are clearly a treasure, under-appreciated in this day and age, and painfully overlooked in a time where politics and social issues plague our nation. Duck Soup is slapstick done right, with a great band of character actors, one-liners galore, and a simple and effective premise that goes very far, surpassing anyone's expectations of \"another stupid comedy from the year one.\" NOTE: It's also interesting to note that Groucho goes on record saying that him and his three brothers were just \"Jews trying to get laughs.\" He denies that the film covered the topics of government and politics purposefully, and that he believes people read too much into it. I guess I'll reword my previous question like so; \"How often do we see comedies tackle difficult subjects, let alone with so much confidence, power, and pride, never becoming indulgent, cocky, or simply crass and ignorant? And they don't even try?\" Starring: Groucho Marx, Harpo Marx, Chico Marx, Zeppo Marx, Margaret Dumont, Louis Calhern, Raquel Torres, and Edgar Kennedy. Directed by: Leo McCarey.",

It's an essential part of their filmography, no doubt, but for me true greatness is achieved only in the follow-up, A Night at the Opera, the one that finally dismissed the unfunny straight- man Zeppo and let Groucho, Chico and Harpo really run wild.",

However, this film leaves nothing to be desired. Moment after moment, the film gets more outrageous as the situations grow more and more implausible. Groucho is over the top as usual, and for me, there's nothing funnier than listening to him insult everyone who comes his way. Chico taking everyday words and mashing them together is also hysterical. Harpo is ingenious in his act as well. Even Zeppo gets a decent role in this film. \"Duck Soup\" includes two of the most famous Marx Brothers acts, the mirror sequence and the final battle scene. As usual, the events stay funny right up to the end. No movie made in recent years can possibly compare to this comedy.

            "content": "Amidst plenty of musical pomp and fanfare - Duck Soup is yet another Marx Brothers' comedy whose brand of humor (which includes insults, wordplay, innuendo, and slapstick silliness) works to its best advantage only about half the time. The rest of the time Duck Soup has a tendency to leave the viewer somewhat puzzled, seriously scratching their head, and saying \"WTF!?\" far too often.With the Marx Brothers' fairly predictable comic-formula set very much into place (yes, there were some pleasant surprises, too), I certainly found that this particular vehicle, showcasing their often outrageous shenanigans, to be noticeably weaker than Horse Feathers.More than anything, I found Duck Soup's haphazard story to have a decidedly rushed feel to it. In fact, I was given the clear impression that they were simply making the whole thing up as they went along. (Well, hey, at least, that's the way that it appeared to me) Even though this film's title seems to have nothing that directly links it with the story, it does add yet another cockeyed element to the overall absurdity of Duck Soup's wonky premise.And, because this film is now 80 years old, it's quite important for the viewer to take that aspect into full consideration and be willing to cut Duck Soup some serious slack. Otherwise one is apt to find themselves becoming totally frustrated by the bizarre antics of the Marx Brothers, and, thus, miss out on getting some sort of enjoyment out of this wacky political satire from Depression era Hollywood.As Duck Soup's story goes - The small, European-like state of Freedonia, being in serious financial ruin, is borrowing huge sums of money from the wealthy widow, Mrs. Teasdale in order to bail themselves out of debt.Before agreeing to OK yet another $20 million loan, Mrs. Teasdale insists that the country's present ruler be replaced by wacko, Rufus T. Firefly.Once Firefly takes over the throne anarchy soon prevails. To make matters worse, the neighboring state of Sylvania sends bumbling spies Chicolini and Pinky to Freedonia to intercept top-secret information, only to set even more chaos into motion.Anyways - It's like I said at the beginning of this review - Give this sort of premise to the likes of the Marx Brothers and its intended humor works its comical charm about half the time.",

            "content": "\"Duck Soup\" is a great movie for all looking for a good laugh. Full of quick wit and satire, the Marx brothers create another hilarious movie. I watched the film several times and each time there was something new to pick up on. With all the slapstick and one liners, more than one viewing is necessary. I especially liked Chico and Harpo as the spies. Harpo didn't talk, so he had many funny facial expressions. He enjoyed cutting things with his scissors. During many of his scenes in the movie, he cuts things off, like during the second lemonade stand scene; he cuts off the lemonade seller's towel, after he wipes his hands on it. The way Pinky cuts off so many things in the movie makes each scene with him very funny and actually makes the viewer wonder why he does it. The film doesn't seem to have a lot of amazing editing, cinematography or juxtaposition of images. They all seem pretty basic. This leaves more focus to the dialogue and the characters. The facial expressions of the characters are emphasized in the medium-close up. This makes the scene even funnier because the viewer can see Harpo Marx's goofy face better. Before and after each scene, the fade out/in is usually used. The soundtrack in this movie is mainly just the talking. There are a few musical numbers, with Groucho and the others singing and dancing, but no music otherwise. The film contains so many funny quotes. For example, Groucho says, \"I got a good mind to join a club and beat you over the head with it.\" Another time he says, \"Married. I can see you right now in the kitchen, bending over a hot stove. But I can't see the stove.\" These are just a few examples of his one-liners. The lighting of this film is definitely geared towards comedy. It maintains a high key or bright lighting throughout. This keeps the feeling happy and joyful. An example is the street vendor scene, The two characters, Pinky and the lemonade vendor, have shadowed faces, as if the sun is shining on them from almost directly above. The fact that they have hats on is emphasized by the production of shadows on their faces. There are also shadows produced behind the characters on the wall of the building. This means there must also be a lighting source facing them straight on. Since they are supposed to be outside, the key light source is from the ceiling. There are many memorable scenes in \"Duck Soup\". The mirror scene, where Harpo is dressed up as Groucho and they both make the same movements, is always good. The street vendor scenes are my favorite; Involving Harpo and Chico harassing the poor lemonade vendor. Another one is the last sequence, which is the war between Freedonia and Sylvania. Groucho changes costumes a few times. He wears a civil war uniform, a British guard uniform, a Boy Scout outfit, and a Davey Crockett outfit. All these scenes enhance the movie and give it it's all-star comedic reputation. Overall, this is a classic must see comedy film. You may think that since it's an older film and that it's black and white, that it wouldn't be very funny, but that is not true. It is just as funny as or funnier than many of the current comedies today.",

Consider the the court room scene where some of America's most patriotic songs are ridiculed, for example \"...all gods children got guns....\". Groucho also delivers some of his greatest one liners, for example when Mrs Teasdale tells him \"it's a gala day for you\" he replies \"a gal a day's enough for man I don't think I could take any more\". He also sings a fantastic political satire in his first scene including the line \" if any form of pleasure is exhibited, report to me and it will be prohibited, I'll put my foot down so shall it be, this is the land of the free\". Harpo also puts in some fantastic physical humour and great comedy interactions with Chico.

For a start most of the major MB films were road tested as stage plays and the film makers didn't do enough to disguise this fact. While people praise the Bothers (plural) there is only one world class talent on show (Groucho) - the others are a leering creep (would you let Harpo near your child?), a pleasant but empty nothing (Zeppo), and an Italian stereotype (Chico - pronounced \"Chic-o\" in family - due to his love of women, not the pronunciation normally used!) The problem with silly comedy is that it is unattackable as regards plot (how can you take anything seriously when opposing parties - in the film proper -  join for a singsong!), so anyone looking for in-depth political satire here will be disappointed. This is just a convenient setting for visual gags and various put downs of (and on) authority and - sadly - women in general.(This might be earliest film example of general bland statements being taken as sexual invitation!) Groucho/Firefly seems hell bent on having his war - as if the very concept of war is fun and should be treated with jest. At one point he fires a machine gun out of the window - but the people that he is gunning down turn out to be his own men (whoops)! Production code values were only introduced later (this is 1933) so there are a few innuendoes and even post-coitus bed scenes!Let me take a minute out to voice my general MB beefs: First Groucho never wrote any of the famous lines that came out of his mouth. Script writers did. They are often credited to him - even in serious quote books. Secondly they were never all that nice in real life. Chico viewed the chorus line of the shows as his own personal sexual play things and hung around with criminals (who took most of his money - through crooked gambling - and threaten to kill him unless he found more). Groucho wasn't called Groucho for nothing and, while master of the put-down, seemed bitter and twisted about money (no matter how much he had). He didn't take direction well (the painted mustache was a one-finger gesture to directors!) and as proof no director ever directed two Marx Brothers films!Returning to Duck Soup,  what do we have: well-rehearsed one-liners are aired, women are chased and bedded, silly songs are sung,  visual gags are aired (mostly pointless vandalism if you want to be pedantic) and war is presented like silly school boys playing in the school playground. Still it is the best Marx Brothers best film, not because it is perfect, but because it showcases what they had to offer the best.",

Duck Soup is not only exceptionally comical, with its drastic physical comedy and dry but very literal humor, but it is also very satirical. Being a satire, it \"pokes\" fun at various issues with the world, this time the object of the satire is war. Right about the time when American's fears where mostly directed at war, the Marx brothers bring this comedy to them in '33. Despite the films age, true comic genius and wit never goes unappreciated except by fools. The film, however old, still had quite a few moments that were laugh-out-loud funny. Whether it was situational, physical, or spoken; all of these types of comedy are apparent and nothing short of remarkably entertaining. Regardless of all this, I must once again implore you to realize that the true \"grit\" of this film is the notions that the Marx brothers had on war. They believed that war could be ridiculous, and showed the rest of the world just how ridiculous it could be. It is plainly obvious that this thought was stretched and contorted. However, the feeling you have after watching this movie is that war can be ridiculous, and that is just what the brothers intended.",

The songs about Firefly's administration and Freedonia going to war are well-done and highly amusing.There are too many memorable scenes in the movie to relate them all, among them the meeting with Trentino, the meeting with the representatives, the mirror scene or even Firefly's \"car\".

Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont), who exerts some control over the nation's doings by virtue of being a sizable creditor, recommends Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx) to replace the old ruler, who didn't measure up.Ms. Dumont, it should be noted, is the perfect foil for Marxian histrionics. If anyone doubts that being the straight person is a talent unto itself, they should watch the way she embraces the comedic lines with a flawless balance of understanding and disregard.The \"T\" in Rufus T. Firefly must stand for timing. Groucho and his brothers Chico and Harpo let fly with wonderful streams of wordplay and puns that pass too quickly to notice them all on first viewing.Much of the humor in this film comes from tit for tat exchanges of physical affronts. Laurel and Hardy were also expert at this; see their film titled, appropriately, \"Tit For Tat\". Such humor later found its way into the pages of Mad Magazine in their \"Spy vs. Spy\" features.This type of comedy is not everyone's cup of tea, but those who appreciate skewering by wordplay as much as swordplay should enjoy it immensely.",

Is this the best Marx brothers movie? I rank it second only to \"A Night At The Opera\", like everyone else would. There's a few weaker moments which don't make it quite as good as that movie, but it's still awesome. It's actually weird seeing as how I don't really consider the famous mirror scene to be one of the film's best gags. I remember Mike Nelson saying that if he could riff with one deceased person, it would be Groucho Marx and I can see why.Nearly all of Groucho's jokes sound like riffs. Right when he makes his first appearance, he can't stop making jokes. I even love the very first scene which features ducks in an actual soup. I guess it gives some context to the movie's name. I thought it was completely random, but this actually was a phrase used back in those days. Groucho steals the show, but Chico and Harpo are hilarious as well. I could simply go on all day talking about the hilarious jokes made in this movie. In fact, I think I'll just spend the rest of my review doing just that.When someone says, \"I'll teach you to kick me!\", Chico responds with, \"You don't need to teach me! I know how!\". Maybe the first great joke was the woman saying, \"I was with my husband until the very end\" which Groucho responds with, \"I can see why he passed away\". Later, she says, \"I want you to meet a very charming lady\". Groucho says, \"It's about time\". One particularly long one was, \"...may look like an idiot and sound like an idiot, but don't let that fool you. He really is an idiot\". Oh, and I was afraid they wouldn't show the actual war scene, but luckily they did! That's what a perfect movie does! ****",

            "content": "Duck Soup (1933) :\nBrief Review -When Slapstick Gags used to be Really Funny in Marx Brothers Era. Want to spend and hour full of gags? Well, you don't need any artificial services if you have Duck Soup in your watchlist. Early 30s comedies were very important for cinema world as some cult classic comedies of silent era needed an updated heirs who could bring laughers through spoken dialogues and Marx Brothers did a tremendous help in this campaign. It was the era when World was introduced to different sub genres in Comedy genre. Duck Soup fulfils the appetite of laughter but also delivers some influential stuff. The film shows that yes a War theme could be so much fun just like Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin proved in silent era. It is nasty, wild, chaotic, noisy, humourous, expressional yet living comedy. I wonder how Groucho Marx mouthed his dialogues so fast, i wonder how Harpo and Chico performed all those tricky activities so naturally as if it was a live circus and i wonder how these 3 manged to go crazy as hell. Totally freaking nuts. Zeppo Marx wasn't high on level but very fine in his limited and sober role whereas Margaret Dumont looks traditionally beautiful. If any current generation writer is seeing this then he/she must learn from Duck Soup that how to write humourous yet cheap looking slapstick gags and how to gamble characteristics with the screenplay. This is a basic syllabus for all of them. I don't really remember Leo McCarey going mad like this with any of film, his mostly known films are Rom-coms but Duck Soup still remains different and special for some reasons. I am gonna recall this laugh riot whenever i will see any slapstick comedy in future and especially those recklessly funny dialogues. \"Where's your husband. Why, he's dead. I bet he's using that just as an excuse\".RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",

I always expect the film to feel stale after too much re-viewing but, dammit, I laughed hardest the tenth time I saw it!Sometimes I think that every long running movie series has to contain one very atypical, very arty entry that polarizes viewers.  For Godzilla, it's actually the quite serious and violent first film.  For the Marx Brothers, it's Duck Soup, a movie completely devoid of sentiment, as Hollywood understands it (there's no happy couples on display here), and internal logic.  It's actually quite a challenging viewing experience; Duck Soup has many unpleasant things to say about war and government, and the barrage of jokes (ranging from broad slapstick to puns to sexual innuendo) can actually be tiring, especially since it hurts to laugh continuously for over an hour.We don't make 'em like this anymore.  Is this a broad comedy, a political satire, or a lavish musical?  Of course, it's all three, a strange cross-breed of genres that would give today's concept-oriented studio execs a heart attack.  So many modern movies are monotonous in concept and execution, but Duck Soup zings all over the map and somehow manages to excel in every way.  The musical numbers are lush and hilarious, and bizarrely, the special effects beat almost anything attempted by science fiction until the 1970s!  Groucho's verbal comedy is beautifully complimented by Harpo's pantomime, and even Chico does okay with his stereotypical Italian schtick. Far from being one trick ponies, the Marx Brothers can do just about anything and everything, which is why they remain more popular - and relevant - than any other old time comedians, including Chaplin, who sometimes gets more credit as an artiste.  At the end of the day, the Marx Brothers are funnier, smarter, and more lovable (in their mangy way) than their rivals. Since this movie is so very strange, I can understand why it occasionally gets a negative review.  It's so far ahead of its time that we're still catching up to it!  (Yes, it is ahead of its time, and yes, it is a satire - pay no attention to people who say otherwise)Too bad comedy is so dreadful these days.  Groucho's nudge-nudge wink-wink sex jokes are a thousand times funnier, and more provocative, than the crass and explicit commentaries we get on the subject today.  And the Marx Brothers understood, better than anyone else, the importance of having a good \"straight man\" - hence Louis Calhern as the long-suffering Trentino and Margaret Dumont, who deserves some kind of posthumous Oscar for allowing the Brothers to torment her so.In short, this is the funniest seventy minutes of cinema ever made.  It's the only Marx Brothers movie that dedicates itself wholeheartedly to pure anarchy and biting criticism, and so it's the only film in the series that might qualify as art.  But why try to classify it?  It's just awesome.",

Ambassador Trentino hires the efforts of two spies, Chicolini and Pinky to thwart Fireflie's attempts.  \"Then we go to the ball game, but he no show up\". Chicolini is tried for treason, in one of the funniest dance sequences ever filmed, \"We got guns...they got guns...all god's chillin's got guns\".Firefly rejects the final offer of Ambassador Trentino and Slavania declares war.  \"Suppose he refuses, what a fine notion that would be...I hold out my hand and he refuses\". Duck Soup contains, not only some of the greatest one liners of all time, \"If I were any closer I'd be behind you\", \"I've got an uncle that lives in Taxes.  Dollars, Taxes\", but the classic mirror sequence.  Many people recognize this gag to be from the I Love Lucy episode that Harpo guest starred in, but in actuality it was performed here first.My favorite gag is where Groucho accidently gets a vase lodged on his head.  Before the dynamite can explode, Harpo draws Groucho's face onto the vase to remedy the situation.

The world was on the edge of a great fall, of a deep dive, of a high jump into the abyss and the Marx Brothers could not resist and make fun of that fateful war coming, of that hateful man who had just been elected, the man with the little mustache, and our dear Groucho, the man with the big mustache played the other and won of course because the situation is totally reversed and the man with the big mustache is the leader of Freedonia, and he puts the old revolutionary uniforms out of the closets where they had been kept since the American Revolution to fight against the Italian-named ambassador of Sylvania, is it Transylvania or is it Pennsylvania, a Sylvania anyway, people who live in the woods like animals, aren't they? The time of prohibition is finished. Other more important things are at stake, freedom and healthy finances, or is it healthy embezzling? All that is kind of small and limited. In other words they are, these Marx Brothers, like burying themselves, getting out of touch. \"You want to be a public nuisance?\" They can't resist the offer. \"How much does the job pay?\" And that triggers one of those famous puns that will live forever and ever through eternity. \"I have got a good mind to join the club and beat you over the head with it.\" You must say that is great humor, even if slightly twisted, if not frankly warped, crooked and distorted. And they don't even hesitate to edge onto the racial front and invent one of these slightly racist jokes that will survive the next atom apocalypse I guess. \"The Headstrongs married the Armstrongs and that's why d**kies were born.\" That's deep, profound, inspired, admirable, isn't it. And since we are on that line, the line of compassion, sympathy and empathy, meditate on this one. \"The workers of Freedonia are demanding shorter hours.\" Isn't that social? But the answer of the newly appointed Roman tyrant is astounding. \"We'll start by cutting their lunch hour to twenty minutes.\" Who said that the Marx Brothers were not social-minded? Where are the liars? To produce such humor in 1933 is quite prophetic, prophetic of a catastrophe coming up the road. When the creative intelligentsia of a country is able to bring together in one of their comedies both racist remarks and anti-labor slogans you can be sure this country is doomed to die a difficult death and definitely labor hard and painfully to give birth and deliver the next phase of its history. The next phase will require fifty millions of dead people, victims and bodies to find some regeneration. A lot worse than all the human sacrifices of the Aztecs or the Mayas. The western world, when they do things in the bloody line, they know how to inundate the earth and the soil and the fields with good warm human blood and fertilize the crops with hot human ashes. Ashes to ashes, dirt to dirt, mess to mess, trash to trash. You can always make it a joke. But that kind of regeneration and rejuvenation through and via blood, blood, and blood again, war, war and war again is unworthy of a human mind, particularly of four human minds, those of the Marx Siblings who are more underlings than siblings in that line of inspiration. That's not the best film of these comedians and clowns and the subtlety of the discourse is definitely too fine for me to understand it, I guess, not to say appreciate it. They might have been better inspired to wait for Charles Chaplin to come with his Dictator and let this other comedian use real humane humor to debunk the tyrant. But that was many light years ahead of their antics. That was the last time the four siblings were together on the same screen. Zeppo Marx was to get out of the band or gang after this duck soup that killed the ducks for sure but produced no delicatessen soup.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",

The Brothers do indeed deliver the laughs, they do indeed contain the necessary energy to motivate and drive a production---but if there isn't cooler heads providing some structure to the movie then you are in for a chaotic hour.Enter Duck Soup.Duck Soup is a whirlwind of jokes, satire, and little cherished moments that have stood the test of time and has cemented as a comedic classic amongst the contemporary film critics (because the reviews back in the 30s were a bit stagnant). However, there is absolutely no moment in which you see any progress towards a rising action, a climax, or a conclusion. Surely there is some humor to enjoy but the act gets a little tiring even with a shorter running time. You can assume that there is a writer and director all you want, but every viewer knows that the Marx Brothers had a firm grip on where the movie was going.Marx Brothers would have been the greatest sketch comedy show in the history of mankind if they had their peak during television as opposed to peaking in stage and early post-silent film. Sadly, we'll never know. But their shtick is prime television material, but somewhat tougher to chew when translated into a lengthy motion picture. Can you imagine Saturday Night Live being 90 minutes? Chappelle Show being 90 minutes? Even Adult Swim programs being 90 minutes? It wouldn't work, even if the smaller pieces are funny and do entertain. This is arguably why Saturday Night Live movies (Outside of Blues Brothers and Wayne's World) never ever work.The greatest comedies of all-time have their best moments interwoven with the plot. Even Caddyshack, a comedy that loosely connects to the main plot, still feels a little...organized. Duck Soup is like bringing a paintball gun that launches 900 pellets a second---surely most will hit but the rest will go flying everywhere. Jokes are all over this movie to a point you have to duck and cover. But unlike their better works like Night at the Opera, the Marx Brothers never give you a chance to recover, to breathe, to be brought back to earth. It is a good comedy, Groucho Marx once again uses his rapid-fire delivery and flawless comedic timing, but the entire ordeal can be quite nerve-wrecking to witness.",

            "content": "For non-stop chaos and hilarity, this Marx Brothers film is hard to beat. Frequently, the screenplay makes little sense, as expected in a Marx comedy. Groucho is especially prominent, doing a little singing and dancing to complement his usual insulting remarks and puns and flirtations. Margaret Dumont has an unusual amount of screen time, this being one of 7 of their films she was in, usually playing a wealthy widow society matron whom Groucho alternatively insults and flirts with. Here, she even gets to demonstrate her opera-trained singing voice. She plays the chief financier of the small country of Fredonia. Thus, she gets to name the new prime minister in the form of Groucho(Firefly), who takes full advantage of his position to do his usual stick. Chico and Harpo also contribute their brands of zaniness, sometimes together, sometimes separately, sometimes with Groucho. In a particularly memorable segment, Chico or Harpo or both are street vendors, selling peanuts. They have a hilarious time fighting with Edgar Kennedy, as the lemonade vendor next door. Sometimes the pair are working for Groucho; sometimes they are employed as spies for the neighboring country of Sylvania. Harpo is Groucho's trickster motorcycle driver. Chico is sometimes Groucho's war minister. Louis Calhern plays the scheming ambassador for Sylvania: the defacto villain. There is the memorable mirror mimicry scene, which provides perhaps 5 min. of silence, while Groucho and Harpo mimic each other's movements on either side of an empty mirror frame, Harpo being made up like Groucho. Chico then arrives, also made up like Groucho. The basic idea had been done in film a few times before, and would be done by others in the future. I'm personally familiar with instances by Bob Hope, Don O'Connor, and even Errol Flynn.In the music department, early on, Zeppo and Margaret Dumont sing \"His Excellency is Due\", then Groucho and Margaret sing \"These are the Laws of my Administration\". Later, the brothers sing \"The Country is Going to War\". All these were composed by the team of Harry Ruby and Bert Kalmar, who were honored in the 1950 film \"Three Little Words\". This was the last film the brothers did for Paramount, as well as being tied with \"Horse Feathers\" for the shorted length, at only 68 min.. One of the obvious differences in the structure of the coming MGM films with the Paramount films, is the inclusion of a young romantic couple, who do some of the singing. and usually have some problem interfering with their ability to get married, which the brothers help to solve. Zeppo would also be totally absent from future films. His presence in the Paramount films, including this one, was always tenuous, anyway.",

Duck Soup being their most famous movie, The Marx brothers have left no stone unturned to make this movie a very special one. Duck Soup is a musical comedy which is heavily inspired from Broadway musicals. It is a rare mixture of witty and mad humor which can make the viewer die of laughter. The song sequences in between enhance the humor further. The story is irrelevant in such kind of a movie which is based more on the acting and precisely antics of the lead actors. While watching this movie, one might feel, no director was assigned the job of directing this movie and perhaps The Marx Brothers themselves were the whole and soul of the movie. But, the legendary Leo McCarey is the actual Captain of the Ship. Acting wise the three Marx Brothers - Groucho, Chico and Harpo carry the entire movie and the comedy on their shoulders. After watching this movie, I understood why Woody Allen once said that 'Groucho Marx was the best comic actor America ever produced'. His comic timing, dialogue delivery, legendary appearance and style of walking etc redefined comedy movies. The Duck Soup could generate mixed viewer reactions. Those who want to critically post-mortem it can trash it, but those who will consider the era in which it was made and just want to enjoy a few laughs will love it. I fall in the later category.Rating : 9/10",

            "content": "DUCK SOUP (Paramount, 1933), directed by Leo McCarey, is hailed as a Marx Brothers comedy masterpiece and regarded the best of their five features for Paramount. Not precisely a movie about the restaurant business with the special of the day being duck soup, but a political satire that needs to be seen more than once in order to get the jokes involved and understand the humor missed the first dozen times around. A forerunner to latter spoofs of this nature as THE GREAT DICTATOR (1940), and DOCTOR STRANGELOVE (1964), or public television's oddball sense of humor from \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" of the 1970s, DUCK SOUP followed the similar pattern of Paramount's MILLION DOLLAR LEGS (1932) with WC FIelds, spoofing both government and the Olympics. As for\u00a0DUCK SOUP, it's in a class menu by itself.Set in the mythical kingdom of Freedonia, the government asks wealthy widow Gloria Teasdale (Margaret Dumont) for another $20 million in order to reduce the taxes. Feeling the money has been mismanaged, she agrees to the loan only if Rufus T. FIrefly (Groucho) is appointed leader. Wanting to gain control of Freedonia by marrying Mrs. Teasdale, Trentino (Louis Calhern), the ambassador of Sylvania, has famous dancer Vera Marcal (Raquel Torres), also his mistress,\u00a0to distract Firefly by flirting with him while at the same time having his hired spies Chicolini (Chico Marx) and partner, Pinky (Harpo Marx) to get enough information to discredit him. When all else goes wrong, a revolutionary war between Freedonia and Sylvania begins, especially since Firefly has already paid a month's rent on the battlefield.From the very beginning with the opening title and credits superimposed over four ducks swimming in a pot of soup, to Mrs. Teasdale singing \"Hail to Freedonia\" as the four brothers pay homage by throwing fruit at her, DUCK SOUP is solid comedy to the extreme, which can be categorized as stupid, insane or hilarious. Regardless of what's thrown in, everything about DUCK SOUP works, and never slows down for an instant during its 68 minutes. While this could be very well be a reworking of a Marx Brothers Broadway play, DUCK SOUP is an original, in spite of reinventing itself with gags taken from earlier works, including Groucho's \"love making\" to Dumont, or the inauguration opening lifted from ANIMAL CRACKERS (1930) as the public awaits for their guest of honor, repeating the lyrics to \"Hail to Freedonia\" as with the earlier \"Hooray for Captain Spaulding,\" until he eventually does.The Music and Lyrics by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby include: \"The Clock on the Wall Strikes Ten\" (sung by Zeppo Marx and Margaret Dumont); \"His Excellency is Due\" (sung by cast); \"Pop Goes the Weasel\" (sung by Groucho Marx); \"Hail to Freedonia\" and \"Freedonia's Going to War.\"DUCK SOUP breaks away from its traditional time out for piano and harp interludes by Chico and Harpo, possibly ending up on the cutting room floor to tighten the pace, along with Edmund Breese (best known as Doctor Wong on 1933's Paramount comedy, INTERNATIONAL HOUSE, with W.C. Fields) credited as Zandor, is seen at a glimpse as one of the cabinet members.While a mythical kingdom, this is no land of Oz. The Marx Brothers retain their traditional costumes and overly familiar personalities: Groucho, the king of insults (\"Remember we're fighting for this woman's honor which is more than she ever did!\"); Harpo, the silent instigator; Chico, the Italian accented peanut stand vendor accompanied by his dog, Pastrami; and Zeppo, the straight man/ secretary in his farewell screen performance. Aside from Margaret Dumont playing Groucho's foil for the third time, other notable performances include Louis Calhern as the debonair villain, Edgar \"Slow Burn\" Kennedy as the lemonade seller, finding that he is no match for his neighboring vendors, Harpo and Chico; and Charles Middleton as the court martial prosecutor.Great moments of site gags seem to all belong to the quiet one, Harpo, acting as Firefly's chauffeur whose motor cycle equipped with attachment seat passengered by Firefly which never seems to go anywhere (Groucho: \"This is the fifth trip I made today and I haven't been anywhere yet.\"); Harpo showing Firefly his bodily tattoos, one which comes to life; Harpo doing a Paul Revere ride after war is declared; and of course, the legendary mirror scene between yours truly and Groucho. Chico gets his quota of laughs with his puns, either with Groucho or Harpo. That all noisy on the battle front finale, which must be seen to be believed, rightfully belongs to all four of the Marx Brothers.Considering its initial failure at the box office in 1933, DUCK SOUP may not be for all tastes, yet did find everlasting popularity in later years due to frequent revivals on commercial television enjoyed by the Baby Boomer generation. It became one of the first Marx comedies to be distributed on video cassette in the early 1980s, and from 1991-92, found a new audience with the cable TV generation on American Movie Classics; later resurfacing on cable again on Turner Classic Movies (TCM premiere: December 18, 2001), where it later became part of its Essentials.Currently on DVD, DUCK SOUP remains a timeless classic, now that it's become American Film Institute's top 100 best comedies of the twentieth century. With laughter being the best medicine, DUCK SOUP may not be the best remedy for all, but at least the effort for fun entertainment is there. (****)",

I've always enjoyed his particular brand of humor. And in this movie he was fantastic. His combination of wit and rapid-fire delivery is rarely seen these days--Lauren Graham on 'Gilmore Girls' comes close, though her humor is different. Jim Carrey and Robin Williams have their own unique styles but they don't really match Groucho. If he wasn't ad-libbing--and it sure seemed like he was but that was apparently part of his talent--the writing was outstanding. The film was rated TV-G but came very close to being bawdy, though that's part of Groucho's charm. Yes, he got laughs by insulting people; Groucho and Don Rickles were masters of that. To me, both comedians are too easy to like for the insults to seem hurtful.Chico and Harpo were quite good too. Chico could have been a fine comic actor on his own, with a delivery that ALMOST matched that of his zany brother.At first I thought Harpo was every bit as talented as Tony Papenfuss and John Voldstad of 'Newhart', but later I realized I had that backwards. I finally saw how truly gifted Harpo was at facial expressions, and he made his character truly likable. Then there was the dispute with the lemonade vendor (including the trading of hats which I wasn't paying enough attention to), and of course the great mirror routine, which I had seen with Lucille Ball but didn't really appreciate.Most of the characters were not supposed to be funny, and it added to this movie's quality that these characters were done completely straight. I never even noticed who Zeppo was, and while all the actors seemed talented, he evidently didn't match his brothers' particular skills.This is definitely one of the great movies.",

            "content": "Talking pictures may have scored a total victory over their silent predecessors, but in the field of comedy the silent style died hard, and slapstick remained a staple of comic cinema well into the 30s. The Marx Brothers in a way rescued the more anarchic form of comedy for the talkies with their wild and nonsensical verbal humour, but they also had enough physicality that they went a great way to preserving slapstick for the sound era. Duck Soup is their most perfect movie, and incidentally also the one which features the most visual humour.The Marx Brothers, even when they were not doing slapstick, had a style that very much harked back to the silent comics. If you look at Chaplin's short pictures, he would normally choose a familiar setting, people it with \"straight\" but somewhat preposterous characters, then bring on his little tramp to wreak havoc. And this is pretty much what Groucho and Co. do in their first five features at Paramount. Duck Soup begins with an extremely pompous and formal set-up, into which Groucho and Chico come blabbering their disrespectful turns-of-phrase, and Harpo gleefully wrecks all and sundry, to the complete consternation of the overblown figures around them. Regular co-star Margaret Dumont is perfect for this, because she is not a funny character in her own right, but she is a slightly exaggerated version of a stock dramatic figure, and this is enough for the brothers to bounce their comedy off her. Louis Calhern is just right here too, because he is a straight man, but one with prickable pomposity as opposed to dramatic intensity. I am at present undecided as to the importance of Zeppo Marx as the straight foil, but in any case his role in this his last film appearance is fairly negligible, and the picture doesn't suffer for that fact. Duck Soup is directed by Leo McCarey, himself a veteran of silent comedy and a student of the Hal Roach studios. McCarey was not a writer for Duck Soup, but nonetheless some of the physical comedy routines and the general bent towards slapstick do bear his stamp. An especially good example is the hat-swapping routine with Harpo, Chico and Edgar Kennedy, a very simple piece that becomes increasingly funny simply because it is stretched out a ridiculous tit-for-tat conflict. Remember it was McCarey who first suggested Laurel and Hardy team up as a permanent duo, and for Duck Soup Harpo and Chico form a distinctly Laurel and Hardy-flavoured dynamic, with Harpo as the chirpy fool and Chico his long-suffering (but no less incompetent) superior. Unlike the talkie scenes, for which McCarey emphasises the snappy pace with frequent angle changes, the physical comedy is mostly shot in long, unbroken takes, allowing the routines to build up undisturbed and proving really just how good the brothers were at it.But there is something else which makes Duck Soup very brilliant. In an age where satire was not common currency at the pictures, this is a surprisingly bold indictment of war. The setting is a fictional Ruritanian kingdom (a fact that in itself makes this feel like a take-off on all those urbane European comedies that Ernst Lubitsch was making in the same studio), complete with grand halls, aristocratic titles and lots of silly uniforms, and Rufus T. Firefly's militaristic takeover nods towards the fascist governments that were springing up all over Europe at the time. And yet there are hints too at the follies of American militarism, with various patriotic marches woven into the musical score. Of course, the satire is never exactly biting and it certainly doesn't have that poignant quality that is present in even the wildest of wartime comedies (such as Dr Strangelove or Life is Beautiful), but it works on the level of being a big raspberry to the seriousness with which war takes itself.Duck Soup is the absolute pinnacle of the Marx Brothers canon. Their subsequent pictures at MGM were rather more serious and plot driven affairs, which would basically detract from what the brothers were really all about. But despite their previous successes, Duck Soup was not quite as popular with audiences as had been the likes of Monkey Business and Horse Feathers. It does lack the variety show format of the earlier movies, and much as I love it I do find myself missing Harpo's harping and Chico's piano. The 1930s were the era of the formula franchise movie, and the consternation of waiting for things you've come to expect can make a good picture seem tedious. However, enjoyed purely for what it is, Duck Soup sees those wonderful Marx Brothers at their funniest, tightest and most intelligent, and in retrospect can be seen as cinema's first really effective blending of slapstick with spoken-word humour.",

I remember this being much funnier when I first saw it about thirty years ago.Look at what we had back in the 30s: massive unemployment, resentment against the monied classes, strong isolationist feelings in the U.S. against Europeans and their internecine wars...This comedy is based on average Americans goofing on upper class twits; the message is that wars are started by uncaring aristocrats over ridiculous points of honor. So Groucho spends the entire movie insulting the twits. Dumont, the good sport, plays it straight as the chief target. Note how she is insulted, but is too polite to respond. There are several warpings: Groucho in his own 'reality', with which we are supposed to laugh, and the 'reality' inhabited by those we laugh at. The 'reality' of the musical portions is somewhat overcooked.Apart from this, the only skit of real cinematic interest is the 'mirrored Grouchos' scene -- if for no other reason, see it for this -- at least that part has aged well.",

Supposedly being a political satire, I expected something along the line of The Great Dictator (1940) or All Quiet on the Western Front (1930). However, here the satire is neither poignant nor at the forefront. What is at the forefront is jokes and wordplays - and not very good ones at that, told like your fast-tongued slightly drunk uncle would tell them. The characters and the story serves as nothing but a vehicle for countless of these jokes and, I must admit, some decent silent movie-type physical comedy by Harpo.Admittedly, Duck soup is more than 70 years old, and not knowing how it was perceived by Americans in the thirties I might be unfair in my criticism since I lack personal experience of that time and place. Some movies make sense at the time of their release but seem hopelessly dated after a decade or two. If I had to guess how Duck Soup originally was perceived I would say that it was considered to be cheeky and daring. Today it is not.",

            "content": "093: Duck Soup (1933) - released 11/17/1933, viewed 6/9/07KEVIN: At last, my favorite Marx Bros. movie. \"This means WAR!\" First they messed with high society in Animal Crackers. Next they wrecked havoc on a cruise liner in Monkey Business. Then they unleashed their antics on the college campus in Horse Feathers. But this time, it's war! The Marx Brothers latest outing, Duck Soup is their funniest, most streamlined, and by far my favorite Marx movie, and it is the first movie on the odyssey that I already have memorized. I'll take this one over 'Night at the Opera' any day. The movie starts out like an achingly routine politics-and-manners play. But when Groucho makes his entrance, it's a non-stop romp from there. Margaret Dumont is at her best. In the previous films, her timing with Groucho was a little shaky. It would go like this: Dumont would act regal, Groucho would toss out a non-sequiter, Dumont would pause to regain her bearings before the next line. Now the awkward pauses are gone, and Dumont never quits, no matter what Groucho says to her. My favorite moment from her is late in the film, when she puts in one last effort to prevent war and must watch helplessly as Groucho inevitably fouls it up. Edgar \"Slow Burn\" Kennedy is a stitch as the burly lemonade vendor who is repeatedly tormented by Chico and Harpo. After watching those scenes for the 18th time, I started to see that while certain comic beats may look chaotic, it is all meticulously rehearsed over and over again until it's perfect. Everyone else is perfect too. The supporting players pull their weight rather than slow things down. In the past the Marx boys played it sort of like they were in a different movie than everyone else. It's the same in Duck Soup, only this time everyone and everything just fits. And the final reel of the big bad war is the most rapid-fire marathon of Marx material I've ever seen. Naturally, I chose the film's climax as the clip to show for a presentation I did in my theatre history class about the Marx Bros. and their similarities to commedia dell'arte (it was way more fun than it sounds.) It comes down to this: The Marx Brothers are all about chaos. Anything that is structured and in order, they come in and tear it apart. By the time they're done with Freedonia, all that's left is pure hilarious mayhem.\"And while you're out there risking life and limb through shot and shell, we'll be in here thinking what a sucker you are!\" DOUG: It's the end of an era with this, the leanest and meanest Marx Brothers movie of all, and one that's very close to my heart, Duck Soup. It's the last one with Paramount, the last one with Zeppo, and the last one in the Pre-Code era. I watched this film for the first time several years ago on TCM. It was on at 1 in the morning, and it was the funniest 70 minutes of my life, totally worth it. Watching it this time, I kind of got this impression: It's as though Zeppo got a role in this boring movie about two countries in political turmoil. Rather than simply act in the film as planned, he invited his brothers over to make things interesting. The result was Groucho, Chico, and Harpo disrupting the proceedings with their trademark mayhem and non-sequiters, while the other actors (Raquel Torres, Louis Calhern, and the great Margaret Dumont) are trying desperately to stick to the script. It's the only explanation for why Mrs. Teasdale ever trusts Firefly to save the nation, or why Trentino ever expects Chicolini and Pinky to come through for him. By the third act, it's as though they just threw out the script and made up the rest. The film's meager running time is filled to the brim with jokes, gags, and insults that come fast and furious; you'll never catch them all in one viewing, or two, or even three. Even 'Airplane' and 'Young Frankenstein' can't match the pace of this one. In one scene, Trentino asks the guys if they \"got Firefly's record,\" and a flurry of gags ensue: a toss, a gunshot, a bell, a cigar, and finally trapped fingers. The only scene that doesn't really work for me is the trial scene, maybe because it feels like filler before the big finale, maybe we're all tired out by that point, or maybe it's just too many other characters stepping on the brothers' jokes and throwing out obvious set-ups. Then there's Zeppo, the youngest brother and straight man one last time, playing Groucho's handsome assistant Bob. I recall when I watched the film for the first time, I didn't know that Bob was actually Zeppo until he joins his brothers in the \"Freedonia's going to War\" number. Not that that's bad; he does what a straight man must, going along with his boss/brother's every odd request (\"Here's five dollars, keep it under your hat. Never mind, I'll keep it under my hat.\"). Margaret Dumont is at her best here. She lets out the necessary reactions to Groucho's subtle insults about her weight, but never loses her cool, and powers on through in-character like nobody's business. Like comedies? Like mayhem? Like classic movies? Like good movies? Like movies AT ALL? SEE IT!Last film: Little Women (1933). Next film: Flying Down to Rio (1933).",

Groucho is Rufus T. Firefly, dictator of tiny, impoverished nation of Freedonia, dealing with the duplicitous ambassador (Calhern) of neighboring Sylvania and his two bumbling spies (Chico, Harpo), who would be accused of treason for switching sides so often if not for the fact that they don't have a loyal, sensible bone in their bodies. Plentiful unforgettable bits: \"This Country's Going to War\" musical number, Harpo and Chico torturing the poor lemonade vendor, the mirror scene, etc., to say nothing for Groucho's endless, twisting wisecracks and double entendres, which come so fast they're easy to miss (repeat viewings are a must). Considered today a top-notch political farce in the vein of \"Dr. Strangelove,\" yet the satirical edge is almost \"accidental\"--the Marx Brothers were just doing whatever they could to get laughs.

            "content": "These days \"Duck Soup\" is generally considered the best of the Marx brothers comedies. However, at the time of its original release, its poor reception was one of the contributing factors to the brothers' split from Paramount. It was also the last of their films to feature Zeppo, who never really stood out much due to his role as a straight man to his brothers' zany antics.In this movie Groucho plays Rufus T. Firefly, the newly appointed leader of the fictional country of Freedonia. Zeppo plays his secretary while Chico and Harpo team up as spies for the Sylvanian ambassador, who is attempting to incite a revolution.The brothers were all in good form for this picture and were joined by frequent comic foil Margaret Dumont. Louis Calhern was also effective as the villain of the piece. Verbal comedy is where the film shines and all of these individuals worked quite well together. On the other hand, I found that some of the physical comedy bits just went on too long.Future Oscar winner Leo McCarey directed the film and I have no complaints about his work here. For the most part, he avoided the staginess of the earlier films. The musical numbers are pretty well done, too, though I would have liked to have seen the brothers themselves show off their instrumental skills as they often did in their movies.Ultimately, I consider this my second favourite Marx brothers comedy after \"A Night at the Opera\". There seem to be differing viewpoints on which one is superior. Personally, I find that this film's anarchic quality is endearing but it doesn't produce as cohesive an experience as their MGM productions that were soon to come.",

Clocking in at just over seventy minutes,this film seems like more of an excuse to patch together various sketches involving the Marxes,and for that this largely works. The actual larger storyline seems superfluous,even a little tedious,but then again I suppose that the screenwriters,director and stars intended to make something that was all at once ridiculous and potentially cumbersome,only to make it all unfold to a gleeful,fun-filled conclusion. This film is still very much worth the watch,and you might find it overall completely delightful as a complete product.

Basically, the majority of comedic characteristics and methods can be traced back to the Marx Brothers, no matter how great or how small the influence. Thus, when watching a film like Duck Soup you have to respect the comedic legacy that you are witnessing on the screen. Whether you find the comedic stylings of this film to be outdated or ingenious, you can't deny the impact.Duck Soup is the quirky slapstick story about Rufus T. Firefly, who inherits the rule of the land of Freedonia. The film follows his antics as he tries to rule a country in his own unorthodox methods. To go into detail about the plot of Duck Soup would be a waste of my time and yours because, frankly, this film is all about the jokes. It is driven by rapidly paced quips and loads of outrageous physical humor. It isn't exactly my cup of tea, but its a lot of fun.The Marx Brothers knew comedy. They were geniuses when it came to timing, delivery, and pacing. This shows in every frame and every word of Duck Soup. It is incredibly evident that these four knew what they were doing and what they wanted to accomplish for every single second of their brief 68 minute film. Normally, it's hard to consider a film that is so short an actual film, but it works. The way the film is so packed with comedy and so scrunched together makes it flow extremely well and move at a pace so quick and so absurd that it adds to the hilarity.Of course, when I say hilarity, I mean general hilarity, not things that I specifically find hilarious. I have to reiterate over and over again how much I respect this film, despite the fact that I don't find it to be particularly hilarious at all times. I laughed out loud a lot, but this isn't exactly what I find to be the greatest brand of comedy. It is nothing more than personal taste. The Marx Brothers weren't trying to please everyone. Plus, the darker and more satirical comedy that I've grown to love hardly even existed back in the Marx Brother's days. This is a film that you have to put in context to the time period, and then you will find all new respect for what a revolutionary comedy it is.This seems to be a recurring theme of much older films for me but, once again, I respect this film more than I enjoy it. It is simply a matter of personal taste. Comedy certainly wouldn't be what it is today without the Marx Brothers, and for that I thank them. As far as Duck Soup being a truly great film, I'm not so sure, but it is important to comedy, and it's certainly a lot of fun.",

The story makes no sense, there is no clumsy \"love interest\" subplot. \"Freedonia\" is a country full of Marx Brothers' anarchy.Louis Calhern does a fine comic turn as Groucho's foil. Groucho also hurls some of his most classic insults to the always naive Margaret Dumont.They always say Jerry Seinfeld's show was comedy about nothing. The Marx Brothers accomplished this some sixty years before Seinfeld's TV comedy with \"Duck Soup\".Most of the very flawed Marx Brothers comedies contain very funny 'bits'. \"A Night at the Opera\" is often held up as their \"best\". Nothing against Alan Jones and Kitty Carlyle, but as far as I'm concerned, their silly love story subplot only stalls more Marx Brothers' comedy. This subplot is presented over and over in so many of their films that it grows quite annoying.\"Animal Crackers\", \"Monkey Business\" and \"Horse Feathers\" are nice companion pieces to \"Duck Soup\", and I consider these early films the Marx Brothers' best. These films let the Marx Brothers run amok, to hell with plot, rhyme or reason.One of the funniest scenes that Harpo has ever performed is his comic bit with slow-burn comic extraordinaire Edgar Kennedy. The shot of Harpo, now barefoot, kicking his feet in Edgar Kennedy's lemonade is classic.

Other 1930's comedies (such as 'Bringing up Baby' or 'Modern Times') are in a different league.I believe that if Groucho Marx had helped to write the script, the movie would have been far better.",

(Don't ask what category those who don't like either fall into.) A similar analogy that I like to use involving classic film comedies is that there are Marx Brothers people and there are Three Stooges people, and ne'er the two shall meet. Being a Marx Brothers person myself, I watched Leo McCarey's 1933 film \"Duck Soup\" with great delight.Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) is named the president of a small city/state called Freedonia, which has just been hauled out of bankruptcy by the wealthy Mrs. Teasdale (longtime Marx Bros. foil Margaret Dumont). Firefly has been appointed the president because of Mrs. Teasdale's devotion to him, much to the chagrin of Ambassador Trentino (Calhern), a man who wants control of Freedonia and the hand of wealthy Mrs. Teasdale. He hires Chicolini (Chico, natch) and Pinky (Harpo) to spy on Firefly so that Trentino can not only become Mrs. Teasdale's husband, but president himself. Because they are the Marx Bros. alliance lines are blurry, and Chicolini and Pinky end up on both sides of the fence. War breaks out and hilarity ensues.Nope, there's not much to the plot, but \"Duck Soup\" is an absolutely riotous film that was almost as surreal as it was funny. Enormous musical numbers that seem to come out of nowhere certainly contribute to the bizarre theme, and this film is even more manic than other Marx Brothers films. Part of the appeal of their brand of comedy is their rapid-fire delivery, sometimes so fast that you don't realize that you've actually heard what you just heard. Teeming with double entendres, (\" \") and featuring the wonderful \"mirror gag\" that somehow gets me every time, I find that there isn't actually a lot to say about the film because it is truly a simple little gem. Barely an hour long, I suspect it contains the most gags in ten minutes that are truly funny than an entire two hour comedic production from the last twenty years. And this comedy is whip-smart and damned funny. This may not be the best Marx Bros. film to initiate someone with, (\"A Night at the Opera\" may be just a tad less manic and a little more \"user-friendly) but it is a bona fide comedy classic that exudes relevancy a whopping 72 years after its original release. 7/10 --Shelly",

            "content": "This is by far the Marx Brother's greatest film, and therefore, one of comedy's greatest achievements. The last film by the four crazies to be made by Paramount, the film tells the story of Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho....who is perfectly Groucho-ish) setting up his kingdom as the new prime minsister of the land of Freedonia. And there's an evil villain (Louis C. Calhern) who wants to take over the whole land.That's....pretty much the plot, and it's basically interweved with comedic sketches and crazy characters. Of course, the other three brothers play pretty substantial roles.... Harpo is Pinky and Chico is Baravelli, the two enemy spies who keep switched sides. Then there's straight-man Zeppo as Bob Rolland, Groucho's secretary who's sappy and always willing to please and serve his older brother. Actually, Zeppo is given a lot more to do compared to earlier films....it's actually his idea for Groucho to insult Calhern, and that's what leads to the war.Ah, yes, the war.... Did I mention that this film is also a satire on war films? The last fifteen minutes or so, in which the four brothers and the ever-lovable Margarete Dumont are stuck in a collapsing house in the midst of battle, are probably the single-most hilarious scenes ever to be put on film. The antics and non-stop, and the brothers know no bounds. The balance of their different comic-personalities work and play off each other in a way that it never did again (although the  passenger room scene in \"A Night at the Opera\" came awfully close). Harpo's silent clown and Chico's pessimistic antics are well balanced with each other, as usual. (Groucho: \"Chicolini, why are you back? I thought you were on the other side.\" Chico: \"I was, but the food's better on this side.\") Groucho is his usual comedic, wise-cracking self (\"Fight for this woman's honor, which is more than she's ever done!\"). And Zeppo lends help as the straight man trying to keep his older brothers under control (Groucho: \"Look at them all flee!\" Zeppo: \"But Your Excellency....\" Groucho: \"Remind me to give myself a medal of honor for this!\" Zeppo: \"But Your Excellency, you're shooting your own men!\")This film is simply comedy at it's best. Political satire that's way ahead of its time, show-stopping songs (\"Freedonia's Going to War\" is also a highlight), and a brilliant mirror sequence between Groucho and Harpo that must be seen to be believed! All in all, this is a perfect example of everything comedy should be. Even after almost seventy years....this film hasn't lost it's fire or wit. It simply proves the fact that there are kings of comedy, and they're names are GROUCHO, HARPO, CHICO, and ZEPPO MARX! Recommended!!!\"Oh, Your Excellency!\" \"Well, uh...You're not so bad yourself!\"**** out of ****",

            "content": "The method of each Marx Brothers film is the same, yet, each unique and essential to see on its own merit. Even though you know what to expect when you see the four brothers on screen, each film is a riot and a great time on its own. Duck Soup, the 1933 film featuring Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo was a hilarious satirical look at a president/dictator's reign over his nation. It had to be a treat for the great Leo McCarey to direct the brothers in such fantastic performances. No Marx Brothers film is a disappointment, but Duck Soup was a riotous heavy-hitting breakthrough, even for the usual fast- paced comedy I expect from the brothers.Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx) new president/dictator of the land of Freedonia, a small country on the brink of economic collapse. Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont), a wealthy widow, agrees to donate $20 million dollars to the country if Firefly was appointed dictator/president, a deal too sweet to pass up. Even though Firefly has no idea what he is doing in a leadership capacity, and refuses to do anything, even run meetings by the rules, the country may be in worse shape with him than without him. Whether for love, or money, Firefly becomes preoccupied with trying to win the heart of Mrs. Teasdale, but he is not alone. Also courting the widow is Ambassador Trentino, a wealthy, much more polished, nobleman. Trentino is also the leader of a neighboring country, Sylvania. The two leaders, fueled by their courtship of the same woman, begin to have several quarrels with each other using their country's interests as a guise. When armed conflict ensues, Mrs. Teasdale's house comes under attack, and whoever can save her skin, will be granted her heart. Rapid doesn't even begin to describe how quickly a Marx Brothers film is set up. Anyone with a short attention span would love Marx Brothers comedy, as they are not only quickly set up with jokes firing what seems like every second, but they are hilarious, even 80 years after they were delivered. And really, in cinema history, who is better at delivering such rapid quips than Groucho Marx? Often disregarded because of his signature slapstick style, Groucho is sensational in the quick-humored roles he always played. It is always fun to see him interact with Margaret Dumont as their on- screen chemistry was one of the earliest examples of perfection. The songs in Duck Soup were a wonderful reminder of how musically talented the Marx Brothers were; which is often forgotten because their comedic talents shine so brightly. The bits in Duck Soup were some of the best the foursome ever performed. I am a lover of Monkey Business and A Night at the Opera, but the mirror scene in Duck Soup, with Chico imitating a mirror image of Groucho is enough to secure a place at the top of any favorite Marx Brothers list for Duck Soup. Duck Soup reminds me how great the \"unfunny\" Marx brother, Zeppo was, and how much I missed him in the later films. He was so much more than a straight man and was never fully utilized to his full potential. Maybe it was his choice to leave the group, or maybe it was mistaken narrow sight of his role in the group, but he remains my favorite Marx Brother for his versatility and musical skill. Delivering a social satire in the way only the Marx Brothers can, reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator for what comic geniuses can get away with saying about society because they do it in a funny way, Duck Soup should be at the top of any list, not just Marx Brothers lists, but rather of standout films from the 1930's.",

As great as the brothers are in Opera & Races, they were somewhat \"tamed\" by Irving Thalberg and his big-studio machine. \"Formula\" was injected into their pictures, and they were forced to share screen time with young, romantic \"leading\" couples who served mostly to interrupt the comedic proceedings from time to time to sing insipid songs to each other. DUCK SOUP (the final of their four Paramount films) is pure, undiluted Marx Brothers anarchy.Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) ascends to the leadership of Freedonia because, in the words of Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont), he's \"the most able man in all Fredonia.\" (Groucho: \"Well, that covers a lot of ground. Say, you cover a lot of ground yourself.\") But with Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo) as spies for rival country Sylvania, there are intrigue and insults, double-dealing and double-entendre galore. As always, the points of the plot are not important, except to set the scene for various high-jinx.One of the best \"bits\" in the picture is a precursor to the famous \"mirror routine\" done later by Lucille Ball and Harpo (better here; sorry, Lucy!). Chicolini and Pinky - both disguised as Firefly - search a mansion for a code and secret plans (Chico: \"Sure, I stole a code and two pairs of plans.\"). Three Grouchos running about results in confusion, a broken mirror and the single funniest sight gag in any of their films. Legend has it that at least one performance of one of their plays had the brothers actually switching roles and, with appropriate makeup and costume, nobody was any the wiser. Indeed, with each made up in Groucho's eyebrows and mustache, they are practically impossible to tell apart.Everything from politics to war movies to musicals is lampooned (what else to do when you've just declared war on a neighboring country but stage a production number?), and poor Margaret takes her usual share of abuse from Groucho. In addition to Dumont, there is able support from Louis Calhern (as the Ambassador from Sylvania) and Edgar Kennedy (as an unfortunate lemonade vendor tormented by Harpo and Chico).Sure, there are plenty of great moments in their MGM pictures, but those were rather like the parties you had when the parents were home, while DUCK SOUP (along with the other Paramounts) is the party you had when the parents were out of town.",

(My vote goes with \"A Night at the Opera.\")   Either way, it remains one of the funniest movies in history.  That said, however, although it began to be fashionable to say so during the 60's, the film is no more an anti-war film than \"Horsefeathers\" is an anti-football film.\"Duck Soup\" strongly benefits from the presence of director Leo McCarey, who learned the comedy business at the Hal Roach studio with folks like Charley Chase and Laurel and Hardy.  McCarey even brought some Roach regulars like Charles Middleton and Edgar Kennedy to the film.  Kennedy, in particular as the lemonade vendor, proves to be a wonderful foil for Harpo and Chico. Their exchanges makes one wishes he could have become a regular in their films like always welcome Margaret Dumont.I was a little disheartened to see all of the negative reviews for this film, but I suppose that is to be expected.  Comedy, more than any other genre, suffers from the vagaries of personal taste.  That is doubly-true when dealing with people who have a prejudice against older or black and white films.  I know many people like that.  This is a pity because the films of 1930's represent the peak of Hollywood comedy.  Still, \"Duck Soup\" boring or unfunny?  Hard to believe.  If the gags are corny, it is because you've heard them stolen and repeated a hundred times.

You can argue if you want, you're wrong. No one can craft comedy like the Marx Bros. and they unfortunatly are not getting their due with the younger generations. Duck Soup is probably their best film. The jokes come fast and furious and you never stop laughing. All Marx Bros. movies have many trademarks and each brother plays essentially the same character in every film. You may think that would get old but it doesn't. Marx Bros. movies have little in the way of plot but that's ok because it isn't needed. All the Brothers need is a setting and they wreak havoc wherever they are. Margaret Dumont is the romantic foil for Groucho in several of their movies and she does a fine job here. In case you were never blessed with seeing one of their films, Groucho is the master of the put down and his quick wit is unmatched, Harpo is the mute trickster, Chico the scheming Italian, and Zeppo the handsome straight man. All of the Marx Brothers were very musically talented and show off their talents in all of their films. Bottom Line: if you haven't seen any of the Marx Brothers movies, see this one first and then go and see them all. And then buy them all. You won't regret it.",

            "content": "Maybe I should say, I get it but it's not funny. I am admittedly not a fan of the Marx brothers although I do acknowledge them for their contributions to modern comedy. But, frankly, I always thought Bugs Bunny did Groucho a lot better than Groucho. I do recall watching reruns of Groucho's game show, 'You bet your Life,' and would have to say that any one of those episodes is better than this movie. At least during those shows he is somewhat personal and engages other people instead of just ridiculing them. In this supposed 'Political Satire' Groucho's character becomes the incompetent and bungling leader of Fredonia, a mythical kingdom. He then sets out with the help of his side kicks to make fun of just about every aspect of government. Yea, I get it.George W haters will probably like this movie for the sheer pleasure of reading him into Groucho's character Rufus Firefly. But the jokes are just stretched too far and Groucho and his brothers are too sophomoric to be taken seriously as political satirists.While some of the jokes may have been ground breaking in their day, like the mirror sequence and the motorcycle stunt, all of them have been done better since. I still laugh out loud every time Barney Fife rides away leaving Andy sitting in the side car of the police motorcycle. I assume that gag came from this film but Barney does it better, and in black and white as well.Maybe it isn't fair to compare the film to modern comedy. It isn't anything like a Jerry Seinfeld introspection and wasn't meant to be. Still, it is filled with jokes that were done later and better by other comics. Who is to say they didn't steal them anyway. Two thumbs down. As for the other Marx brothers I wonder if they would have ever even had a career without Groucho. I gather one is some sort of mute clown and the other an Italian stereotype. Maybe that played back then but not now. To me Groucho keeps telling the same joke over an over. Kind of like Jim Carrey. Hardly funny the first time then really irritating.Watch it for the historical value if you must, to see what films used to be like. Plan to waste 68 minutes of your life.",

            "content": "\"I got a good mind to join a club and beat you over the head with it.\" The Marx Brothers have been fondly remembered for several of their timeless comedy productions. Similar to Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, their classic films are overflowing with terrific gags that are still hilarious even during the 21st Century.On the topic of the best Marx Brothers picture many will agree that Duck Soup generally comes out on top. I strongly agree. Duck Soup was a massive failure at the box office when first released; despite this, I found the film to be excellent entertainment and one of the best classic comedies in cinematic history.Be warned, though, that some might not find 30s humor to their liking. I absolutely adored the gags, but there will be some who disagree.The country of Freedonia is in a financial mess. To save the country from bankruptcy a wealthy woman (Dumont) agrees to donate a large sum of money. But in return she requests that Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) takes charge of Freedonia. But mayhem erupts when Firefly takes charge; he is a stubborn, sadistic leader who refuses to play politics by the book.To make matters worse, the country doesn't have a strong relationship with their neighboring country Sylvania. The government of Sylvania decide to send agents in to recover top secret information (i.e. the country's war plans). When relationships worsen between Freedonia and Sylvania, Rufus declares war just for the hell of it.Duck Soup is a film filled with plenty of wonderful set pieces. The laughs just never get old. Said laughs are a combination of witty dialogue and wonderful physical humor. My favourite gag of the film will always be the mirror sequence. I died with laughter when I was watching that scene.There are several other physical gags that I will always love but don't do much for advancing the plot. Not that I'm complaining, though. What makes this classic a whole lot better than recent comedies by modern comedians is that there was focus and attention on actually developing a discernible plot rather than focusing on the laughs. The Marx Brothers found the perfect balance of developing a good plot as well as a heavy concentration on the great humor. The plot isn't groundbreaking, but at least it's actually present.I liked the energetic performances from everyone in the cast. The four Marx Brothers present in the film give it 100% (the final film that featured all four brothers). It's obvious that some of the more complicated gags had to be thoroughly rehearsed. This just goes to show how focused they were in the days preceding a heavy reliance on special effects or cutting corners.Groucho was the real stand out for me in the movie. Don't get me wrong - they are all tremendously good - but my favourite was definitely Groucho. He was just so sharp and funny! As a confused politician, he nails it. The gags are staged very well thanks to both the cast and the great directing as well.Overall, Duck Soup is a classic and a fantastic movie. It's funny and very entertaining. Proof that 1930's humor is still funny after all these years.",

Hyperbole non withstanding, I absolutely love this movie. At a certain level it can be taken as a satire, but beyond that, it's just joyous, surreal anarchy. In fact, for all Groucho does to screw up the government here, I don't think this film is really drawing parallels to other leaders. Groucho is not stupid here or misguided, because Rufus T Firefly is no different from any of his other roles. But before I become too analytical here, let me stress the comedy of the film. Jokes are fired at you at a breakneck pace, and before you can even comprehend a joke that falls flat, three more come at you. And for every joke that doesn't work, 50 do. I'm not kidding. There is nothing here to be taken seriously. The only purpose of the film is to make you laugh. And if it's all just too much for the viewer to take in, watch a Night at the Opera first.

            "content": "In viewing Duck Soup for the first time in several years, I was quite taken, not only by the Marx Brothers' work, but by the strides they and Hollywood in general, had made in a few short years. I had just been reading that all newspapers, maps, etc., that characters held in their first movie, The Coconuts, had to be sopping wet, so the crackling of paper didn't drown out the dialogue in the primitive microphones. From the early `talkies' days of 1929, the studios and the four brothers had come a long way by 1933.The Marx Brothers, director Leo McCarey, and sound man Harry Lindgren showed that they had already mastered sound, in addition to the brothers' wonderful sight gags. I was completely taken in when Harpo (having been warned in a severe whisper by exotic sex kitten Raquel Torres not say a word, while spying downstairs at night, or face a firing squad), begins following the combination to what he assumes is a safe. It turns out to be a radio, loudly belting out John Phillips Sousa's `Stars and Stripes Forever,' to Harpo's horror \u0096 with the loudest and most dramatic portion coming after he has battered the radio to pieces! This is a delightful gag and Harpo manages not to telegraph it. Later, when Harpo is sent out as Paul Revere, McCarey again shows his grasp of the modern soundtrack. At first he gallops along to a dramatic cavalry charge tune (the name of which I cannot place). The tune slows, though, as Harpo's horse slows. The camera turns and we see a Thelma Todd look-alike (Who IS she, anyway? She is not mentioned in the extended cast.) undressing in the window. Suddenly `Ain't She Sweet?' replaces the galloping charge, as Harpo's attention is totally diverted (in keeping with his well-established character) from his patriotic duty.Of course this is the Marx Brothers at their peak. Groucho's witticisms and paper-thin attempts at romantic sincerity in courting wealthy Gloria Teasdale (the great Margaret Dumont) are hilarious. `Will you marry me? Did you husband leave you any money? Answer the second question first!' Later, during the battle scene, he yells `We must defend this woman's honor-which is probably more than SHE ever did!' Also during the fight, he applies water to her face after she had been knocked out by a falling light fixture. `Hey, that's our only water!' Zeppo cries, nodding toward the pitcher. To which Groucho sagely points out that `This is our only WOMAN!'  Of course his classic `I can see you leaning over a hot stove. Now I can't see the stove!' is pure Groucho. Zeppo is as solid as ever and Chico & Harpo their old boisterous selves. The `mirror' scene with Groucho and Harpo (disguised as Groucho) is one of the group's all-time highlights (which, of course, Harpo recreated with Lucille Ball years later).The sting of the Hays Code was still in the future and the boys were allowed to run roughshod \u0096 and it worked. Unlike later fare, Duck Soup showed the Marxes at their zany, irreverent (i.e., the classic scene with Harpo, a girl & a horse, in bed, with the `shoes' of each neatly laid on the floor, by the bed) best. Could they have maintained their momentum, had censorship not been tightened? Who can say? At least we have a handful of truly inspired Marx Brothers films. This one is probably the best.",

Now, obviously one watches the Marx Brothers for entertainment and sheer hilarity, not for social messages, but I think this is also a very good (in its own wacky way) anti-war movie.What can I add to other reviews?

One of politics.... As in most Marx Bros. film music is a core part of the offering although perhaps less then in most films in that the amazing talents of Chico and Harpo are not proposed ... (I guess the plot did not lend itself for the typical piano and harp solos that appear in most Marx Bros. films).There is an initial musical number that is satirical and political... including the lyrics \"the last guy who ran this place did not know what to do with it. If you think this country is worst off now just wait till I get through with it\". Marvelously entertaining and executed. An interesting glitch in this scene can be noted when groucho in his prancing around turns around and expects to find an actor there but instead finds a curtain... see if you can detect this.The comical scenes flow from one part of the story to another seamlessly and the movie includes some \"Classic\" scenes that have become landmarks. In particular the peanut stand scene where Chico and Harpo confront the lemonade vendor.. and the unforgettable mirror scene where the Bros. try to fool each other that they are seeing their own image.Full of political oriented satire... Groucho hires whomever he pleases and manages the government as one can expect... leading to a foolish war (aren't most wars foolish?) caused by the insult of an ambassador in which he calls Groucho an \"Upstart\".. At one point a financial report is provided ...\"I hope this is clear\".. Groucho responds.. \"Why this is so clear a 4 year old can understand it\"....then turns to his secretary Zeppo.. \"go get me a 4 year old ..

Harpo Marx plays an idiotic spy who doesn't talk and he brings the slapstick comedy to the mix and it works beautifully. I miss these quick paced satires with biting dialogue.

It was not made by a comedy autuer, like a Chaplin, Keaton, Allen, etc. However, it contains the greatest number of laughs ever put on film. I know I must have too much time on my hands, but I clocked at LEAST 2 jokes/gags per minute. That adds up to about 140 in this 70 minute picture. Today, movies are considered if they have about 2 good jokes the entire film! DUCK SOUP is just sheer, unpretentious comedy genius at its best.

The Italian dictator Mussolini banned its showing in Italy since he thought they were making fun of him. For myself, I think it was making fun of Hitler years before his invasion of Poland. There are a number of classic scenes, but even many more outrageous jokes and situations. I've said enough since I would exceed the 1,000 word limit by tenfold.

I'll even give Zeppo his props, seeing as their best movies were the ones he appeared in. And Duck Soup was the best of the best.The plot? What, are you kidding? It's a Marx Brothers movie! No, seriously, this one has a neat, subversive little     anti-war/government message (hidden deeply, I'll grant you). Groucho is somehow appointed leader of Freedonia, and a war ensues. That pretty much wraps it up.What makes this the best Marx Brothers movie (and hence one of the finest comedic film of all time)? I think it's the relative lack of slow moments. So many of their movies, especially the latter ones, are dragged down continuously by the awful musical sequences that spotlight whatever lame, warbling \"talent\" they were using for the unnecessary love story. The songs in Duck Soup are actually pretty funny themselves instead of interrupting the laughs.

            "content": "This movie is unarguably the best of the Marx brothers' films. Funnier than \"A Day at the Races\" and even \"A Night at the Opera\". The fact that it takes place in a political backdrop is even funnier. You may get more enthusiastic about this film after learning that the Marx brothers' funny nonsense is combined with politics and war here. Not only that, it's an amazing satire! And for a movie from the 1930s, the technology is great too. The special effects (during the war and when Harpo is in Groucho's office) are amazingly well. However, the movie belongs to Groucho Marx, as the irresponsible, hyperactive and ready-witted Rufus T. Firefly. Chico and Harpo are two bumbling detectives who cause mayhem wherever they go, and boy, are they funny! The Marx brothers improvised a lot over their roles. Groucho as the cigar-smoking, bespectacled, big-black-mustache donning \"upstart\", Harpo as the dumb, joker-haired and childlike prankster and Chico as the Italian-accented wise guy. Unfortunately, Zeppo couldn't do that. He became more like a filler. Anyway, unfunny though he may be, he does do justice to his role in \"Duck Soup\". Another key element is Margaret Dumont (Mrs. Teasdale). She provides a target for Groucho's jokes in many of the Marx Brothers films, and \"Duck Soup\" sure isn't an exception. Her acting skills are noteworthy, and she fits extremely well into the amazing world of the Marx Brothers. This movie is, for me, the best of the best comedies of all time! A movie buff's life is unfulfilled if he hasn't watched at least one of the Marx Brother films. None of the Marx Brothers are among us now, but their legacy will last on!",

Having grown up with Looney Tunes, Duck Soup is, ina manner of speaking, like going full circle and finding myselfhome again.Another thing I really like about Duck Soup (or any Marx Brothersfilm) is Harpo, doing his silent movie character in a worldsurrounded by sound.  This creature from another era gives asurrealistic depth to the comedy offered on screen.It is said that Duck Soup's anarchic style is what makes it currentand relevant.  I beg to differ.  I rather think Duck Soup remainstimely because of \"We God's chillun an' we got guns, so let's go towar\".  Sounds absurd, doesn't it?  Well, it's how it happens, isn't it?How a people, any people,  can be whipped-up into a war frenzy forno excusable reason (such as Firefly's war-at-all-costs mentality),is the ultimate essence of this film.  The fact that Duck Soup doesthis in an absurd manner makes the observation easier to digest,putting up a mirror to us all without offending so easily with thetruth.  The message, in some level, makes its' way through.Tapping into universal truths and skewering them, Duck Soup wastimely when it was made, and remains timely today.",

This is why many of the reviewers note that it takes a few viewings to really comprehend the depth and pace of this movie.It is interesting to note that the movie was a collection of gags and bits delivered on the live stage and brought to the screen. Live, the performers have the ability to pace the comedy to allow the audience time to catch their breath. You can see this movie has this component in it - anticipating the theater audience's reaction and speeding up or slowing down the movie's rhythm. It is brilliant.Finally, this movie is a classic because in the context of its time, this was probably as radical and far thinking a movie as was ever made. Slapstick and anarchy can be delivered within any plot or theme, in \"Airplane\" it was a disaster movie for instance. But here, the back drop of a nation's bankruptcy, ineffectual leaders, aggressors and appeasers, Duck Soup gives its dose of anarchy at the heart of government.",

I refer, of course, to the racist joke Groucho tells. It's the one about the Armstrongs. The punchline was, \"Then the Headstrongs met the Armstrongs, and that's where the darkies came from.\" I recorded this movie about twenty years ago because an associate of mine used the song \"Hail Freedonia\" as an example of hypocrisy.

After one taste, you'll duck soup for the rest of your life.\"The Marx Brothers' finest and funniest film has all the right ingredients for a fine and funny film. It is an extraordinary dose of non-stop nonsense from start to finish, and one of the funniest films of all time. Groucho is on top form with his relentless puns and sharp insults, especially in the interplay between Margaret Dumont and himself; Harpo continues his quest to induce heart failure to those in the audience who are capable of laughter by use of first-class visual humour; Chico complements these two perfectly by adapting to their methods and creating a unique rapport with each, while adding his own brilliant style of looking and sounding like an idiot (but don't let this fool you -- he IS an idiot) through his seeming misuse of the English language and his zany behaviour; and Zeppo somehow completes the group quite nicely by providing good straight support.\nThe whole film succeeds because absolutely nothing (apart from the comedy) is taken seriously; situations, people, clich\u00e9s, film techniques, political ideas, or anything that especially has to do with pomp and authority, are all mercilessly mocked, given a fresh slant, or their legitimacy simply ignored. Which, in a Marx Brothers satire, is as it should be. (In fact, the best comedies contain an element of this.) And the underlying theme of the absurdity of war ultimately comes across through the anarchy, satisfying the eggheads.DUCK SOUP has been seen as one of the candidates for the best comedy ever made. It would definitely be in my top 5, with Laurel & Hardy's WAY OUT WEST and BLOCK-HEADS at 2 and 3. My personal favourite film is SONS OF THE DESERT. I do not wish to detract from the sheer genius of the Marx Brothers, and the dazzling brilliance of DUCK SOUP, but in my opinion, Laurel & Hardy remain unsurpassed as the supreme masters of comedy. Not only were they magnificently inventive and subtle (their subtlety was so good that a lot of people even today will refute the claim that Laurel & Hardy were subtle) -- like Chaplin -- but they also made this ingenuity exceptionally funny -- like the Marx Brothers (the greatest comedy group of all time), W.C. Fields (along with Charley Chase, the greatest solo comedians of the Golden Era) and Buster Keaton (the master of silent comedy) -- and did so consistently in the vast majority of the 106 films they made together (and even in a substantial number of the films they made separately), whether silent or sound, short or feature.The Marx Brothers are those from the sound era who perhaps come closest to the levels of Laurel & Hardy's humour. Theirs has been described as Laurel & Hardy 'sped up', or with less of a sense of pace. The same absurdity and anarchy is present in their work, yet Laurel & Hardy's characters have more humanity. After watching DUCK SOUP, I felt elated and satisfied with the quality and quantity of the comedy, yet I observed that the characters had really been more or less zany caricatures and stereotypes, who were there mostly to keep the superb gags flowing, whereas Laurel & Hardy were two perfectly rounded and believable people, making mistakes and facing consequences (although the pair's general incapacity to fully comprehend their circumstances provided a certain distance, and in some cases a very basic form of cynicism or irony, ensuring that, as with the best comedy, things are considered or interpreted in a less serious fashion -- Stanley's deadpan graveness, like Groucho's, seems to mock the idea of solemnity), and this therefore, I feel, intensified the comedy and made the characters, situations and gags even funnier, because they came from a human well-spring, forming and producing human reactions. Although Stanley is regarded as a more extreme comic character, less in contact with logic than Ollie, it is the latter that provides the solid link with reality -- the Marx Brothers had this to a lesser degree than L&H, although it was not entirely absent, and they were given more depth in the MGM features. (That is why I believe the two best films from each of the eras in the Marxes' career -- this and A NIGHT AT THE OPERA -- should not be mutually exclusive, as their zaniness is at its least diluted in the Paramount years, but is set within more of a frame of believability at MGM, granting slightly more depth to the characters.)Of course, Marx Brothers fans will argue that the Marxes were Hollywood's 'alternative comedians', attempting to change the face of traditional comedy, and create their own unique style; and concepts that were prevalent in the silent and early sound era, like creating identifiable comic characters, did not really need to be called upon. In fact, with their exaggerated costumes and mannerisms, the team seemed to be satirizing the whole idea of what Chaplin, Keaton or Langdon did with their 'Tramp', 'Stone-face' or 'Boy' characters.However, I am not trying to pit Laurel & Hardy's groundbreaking comedy style (for they were in fact crafting a very innovative body of work under a subtle cloak of traditionalism) against the pioneering work of the Marx Brothers; I am just reasserting the brilliance of L&H after their work was practically overlooked in the disgraceful debacle of the AFI's comedy poll. I am also attempting to point out that although comic characters don't have to be three-dimensional to be funny (proved by the Marxes), comedy is generally intensified when they are (as with L&H). Unlike the Stooges, who were also two-dimensional, the Marx Brothers' personae were at least engaging. So give me a break.Anyway, DUCK SOUP is a masterpiece, the Marx Brothers were geniuses, and you haven't stopped talking since I got here -- were you vaccinated with a gramophone needle?",

I've loved the Marx Brothers since my childhood (roughly 30 years ago) and this was the first of their 13 films I saw on TV.  I can understand why it was initially a bomb at the theaters in the 1930s.  The humor is set at lightning fast pace.  A crowd can laugh loudly right over the next few jokes.In the next couple of Marx Brothers films the boys road tested the material so as to time the humor to audience response (plus they added sappy love story subplots).  To me, this puts \"A Night At The Opera\" and \"A Day At The Races\" behind \"Duck Soup\".The manditory musical numbers inserted into almost all depression-era movies (after the advent of sound) are even tolerable in \"Duck Soup\" because the brothers push them over-the-top.  Don't expect an engaging plot.  In fact, don't expect much of a plot at all.  This is one of those films that you can jump into anytime (but you'll later want to see all that you missed).This movie is best viewed on a one-on-one basis.  The perfect film if you're feeling lonely and depressed (as confirmed by Woody Allen in the 1980s with \"Hannah & Her Sisters\").  If it were a boxing match, you'd never know what hit you.",

Having nearly completed the AFI top 100 a few years ago, I decided to go back and watch the last three movies that I had trouble renting at that time. Prior to watching this film I watched Chaplin's masterpiece 'City Lights.' Perhaps it was the juxtaposition of the two films that made Duck Soup appear to be absolute dreck. I, like some other rational viewers who gave this film less than 5 stars, went into this film buying into the hype and expecting to be surprised with witty remarks and political satire from an earlier era. Regrettably the film barely managed to make my smile despite my natural disposition towards smiling. There was no coherency in the storyline (if that was ever even intended). The jokes were a high majority of puns that made me want to research the history of the pun as a joke in case if it is a recent phenomenon to consider the pun on par with the 'football in the groin' on the comedic intellect index. The remainder of (alleged) jokes were awkward slapstick or a few lame attempts by Chico to get a few gags out of Italian pronunciation. I recommend this movie if you want to complete the AFI top 100 list (a shallow reason if there ever was one), but save it for last or else you may decide to never watch a film again without a thorough review in advance. I don't know if I can begin to comprehend how this film has become so highly regarded when its contemporary films still stand the test of time. Perhaps it deserved a higher rating upon release, but its reception at the time would refute that assumption. It certainly isn't funny now even if you are into esoteric 1930's humor.",

            "content": "You read that right. I am right now saying that Duck Soup is the best movie of all time. You may not agree, but that is what I am saying, and here is why:The Marx Brothers, first off, are the funniest comedy team ever to grace the silver screen. Groucho's quips, Chico's Puns, and Harpo's silent comedy are all very different, but they work together beautifully to great comic effect. And this is their finest effort. Plain and simple.The movie is a classic simply because of it's amazing anti-war message. There is not one single scene in this entire movie that says \"War has it's upside.\" The whole movie is just scene after scene of anti-war political stance.Now this is where it gets really good. Mixed in with the politics is also scene after scene of complete and utter rediculousness. The Marx Brothers are, after all, the Marx Brothers. So the whole movie is a message/stupidness blended so perfectly you don't even notice that the anti-war is there. It just kind of hits you after the movie is done.That said, from here on out I'll be focusing mainly on the comedy aspects of this movie, because, as a 15 year old, I'm really not that big on politics. This is the last Marx Brothers movie in which the car has four wheels. Zeppo left after this picture, and it was just never quite the same without him.The movie has three great songs, and unlike songs from many other movies by the brothers, they are all comedic songs, with the possible exception of \"When the clock on the Wall Strikes Ten,\" but that is not a so-sappy-it's-laughable love song either, and it's just snappy enough to work.This movie contains five of the Brothers ten best bits. Those five are, in no particular order, the mirror scene, Chicolini's trial, the scene with Harpo and Chico in Trentino's office, the insults at Mrs. Teasdale's party, and the final battle scene. The other five can be found in my reviews of the Brothers' other movies.This movie has a total of zero dull spots, and I think it's length (68 minutes) has something to do with that. But what ever the reason, it is and will always be The Greatest Movie of All Time.10/10",

It is one of the best comedies of all time, has held up well over the years, and has been copied from other comic genius' who never seem to get it nearly as good. Also, it is considered to be one of the few \"real\" anti-war films, in that it never, not for one moment, takes war seriously. Instead, it makes it look as stupid as any act can be, and the people involved are just kind of screwy. It has been said that you can't make a truly anti-war film because in some way you have to glorify some aspect of it. The camaraderie, the excitement of victory, the honor in the face of defeat, the glory of being a selfless hero, the people who come together to remember the hero who lost their life. Duck Soup never for one minute takes anything seriously. The film is about, essentially, if one can say it has a plot, two dictators destroying their own countries. It was such a slap to rising fascists that Mussolini banned the film in Italy. The motto is simply \"War is stupid.\" Given this argument, Duck Soup is, perhaps, the only true anti-war film, and a great comedy as well!!! A flop when first released, Duck Soup is now considered by many to be a comic masterpiece. There are so many great moments that it really isn't worth commenting on.

The 1933 comedy Duck Soup displays the talents of the Marx brother quartet featuring Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo. Their comedic performances involve mix-ups with lemonade stands, hats catching on fire, and utter chaos concerning a war between lands over love. I thought Groucho's performance of Rufus T. Firefly supplying the constant one-liners was entertaining. A favorite part of mine is the brilliant mirror sequence done by Harpo and Chico's characters. The symmetry and precision between the two actors was priceless. It's hard to believe that this film, which is considered to be one of the Marx brother's best flopped at the box office.

McCarey's direction delivers musical numbers, slapstick routines, and verbal satire for a delightful comedy classic. I appreciate Duck Soup more as the older I get, the more I understand and enjoy all the verbal jests. McCarey makes Duck Soup a real blitz of humor that slams its way into your heart. Duck Soup is a tight 69 minutes thanks to editor LeRoy Stone's slick cuts directly from joke to joke without missing a beat. \n\nWriters Harry Ruby, Bert Kalmar, Arthur Sheekman, and Nat Perrin provide humor lambasting nationalism and blind patriotism for brilliant satire years before Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator. I loved the clever verbal jokes from Groucho and Chico, especially the silent comedy from Harpo. The physical comedy and slapstick stuff still works effortlessly to get tons of laughs. Henry Sharp's cinematography has tons of wide shots with only a few select close-ups, so that we catch all the visual set-ups and gags.\n\nGroucho Marx spews out tons of witty dialogue as new leader of Freedonia Rufus T. Firefly. I like that even if a joke goes over your head, Groucho just moves onto the next gag or bit of wit without losing a step. He's excellent as the idiotic political leader. Harpo Marx is hilarious as Pinky the silent spy. His prop work, cutting things in half, and messing up is excellent mime work. Silent comedy often ages well and Harpo's visual gags had me screaming. Chico Marx is a riot as Chicolini the spy with quick wit and a neat foil for Harpo to play off. Zeppo Marx aids Groucho's humor as Firefly's secretary Lt. Bob Roland. He complements Groucho's smarter humor nicely.\n\nMargaret Dumont is great as the uproariously silly sponsor of Freedonia Mrs. Gloria Teasdale. Her jokes opposite Groucho work well. Louis Calhern is excellent opposite Groucho as the constantly insulted Ambassador Trentino of Sylvania. Raquel Torres is super pretty as the femme fatale Vera Marcal. I loved Edgar Kennedy's blowhard, blustery lemonade vendor. It's great that half of Duck Soup has nothing to do with politics and is just Chico and Harpo ruining a lemonade stand vendor's entire life.\n\nComposers Harry Ruby, Arthur Johnston, Bert Kalmar, and John Leipold play around with boisterous army marching orchestral music. I liked Harry Ruby and Bert Kalmar's satirical patriotic songs.\n\nIn conclusion, Duck Soup is hysterical and clever for a timeless piece of satire and slapstick alike.",

If you have seen it, you already know how great it is and why it deserves its reputation as one of the most beloved comedies ever made.",

It's a similar feeling I had when I watched Chaplin's Great Dictator, and the lead's constant buffoonery just got on my nerves.

Like any good madcap comedy, the plot in Duck Soup is merely a loose structure that is sitting there for them to fill with jokes, and this one is definitely full of them. I really love the witty dialogue that includes a lot of one-liners that effectively play on words. The jabs are coming so rapid-fire that you almost don't have time to laugh for fear you'll miss the next one. What's really great about these guys is that they aren't just good with comedic dialogue, they also nail physical comedy. There are a few scenes that are very reminiscent of Chaplin or other silent comedians, and I love them too. This is the type of movie that includes a team of people who are living in a comedy, but the rest of the world is still in a dramatic film, and that always makes me laugh. The way everyone else plays straight men to the Marx brothers comedy works brilliantly. I think some people who expect more story from their movies would find Duck Soup frustrating, because it doesn't really make sense, and jumps all over the place, but I think it works because the comedy holds it all together. My one hesitation is that they chose to include a few musical numbers. They aren't all that funny, and they don't do much to move the story forward. It just felt like everything was put on hold for the song, and then picked up again. Aside from those few strange moments, I found Duck Soup to be a delightful comedy and one I would love to watch regularly.",

I'll only add a few personal thoughts.\n\nThe Marx Brothers never acknowledged serious satirical intent with this movie. Groucho famously said they were just \"four Jews trying to get a laugh.\" I sincerely doubt Harry Ruby and Bert Kalmar were utterly apolitical when they conceived the \"Declaration of War\" musical sequence in this movie - its intent is clearly satirical, whether the Marx Brothers thought so or not.\n\nI was in my early teens when I first saw this movie. Even before I was particularly sensitive to such cinematic factors in my movies, the final Battle Sequence from Duck Soup always seemed slapdash and insane, thrown together with massive leaps of continuity and logic. Groucho is in different costumes for each take. At first, Firefly rushes to Mrs. Teasdale's home, then Mrs. Teasdale is at the Firefly headquarters at which he started the scene. Not even the most cursory attempts at logic, unity and continuity are observed. It seemed as if the director was in a mad rush to get this movie done.\n\nBut now, the slapdash look of this movie's final scenes seem in retrospect like purposeful deconstruction. Just as war erodes civility and structure in real life, so does war erode the civility and structure in this movie. The insanity of the end of this movie is no less insane than war itself.\n\nThis sounds like pompous overanalysis; the word \"deconstruction\" didn't even exist when this movie was made. But Leo McCarey was a Hollywood veteran when he directed this movie, having directed or produced hundreds of movies. He knew perfectly well how to structure a movie. While it may be a bit pretentious calling this movie deconstructionist, one must acknowledge that at some point, McCarey decided just to throw logic out the window, just pare the movie down to a breakneck stream of gags and hurtle this film to its anarchic conclusion. \n\nThis film is an anarchic masterpiece, and anarchy is the enemy of Fascism. This film was banned by Mussolini in Italy. He certainly saw the anarchy in it.",

Firefly and Harpo Marx's Pinky. Groucho Marx delivers amazingly written lines that never fail to make one laugh. No other actor could have made it work. Harpo Marx plays an idiotic spy who doesn't talk and he brings the slapstick comedy to the mix and it works beautifully. I miss these quick paced satires with biting dialogue. Off the top of my head, the most recent one I can think of is Airplane, which was all the way back in 1980. Hollywood! Bring these back! They work wonders! People of the world!

Chico and Harpo play spies who attempt to gather info on Firefly for the rival country of Sylvania. Zeppo is also in this one.

At 68 minutes, it could hardly be considered long, but if it was much longer I felt it would have worn out its welcome.  The Marx Brothers' trademark humor has aged well, but I felt that a lot of the wordplay was hit or miss.  This might be due to the rapidity with which Groucho spits out the lines, because not all of them were funny to me and quite possibly because some of them went over my head.  What I felt was the best part of the movie were the physical comedy routines.  As such, my favorite parts were a running gag in which Harpo torments a lemonade salesman, a scene involving a mirror and the final act where Groucho changes costumes in every scene.  Since the movie is one of the earlier \"talkies\", the acting is somewhat stiff/stilted (in a cinematic context, but perfectly normal in a theatrical context).  Margaret Dumont's Mrs. Teasdale is probably the best example of this, although her character was supposed to be that way.  Overall, I thought the movie was very well done, but I got the feeling that the Marx Brothers have done better.  This type of comedy mostly works for me, and I look forward to delving further into the Marx Brothers' filmography.",

Even though a few jokes fall flat, what you walk away remembering is the material that works, like the ongoing feud between Harpo Marx and a lemonade vendor, and the mirror gag.  I'm glad I took the time to watch this, and you should to, if only to see how influential this movie really is.",

And the slapstick routines from Chico and Harpo are lifted straight out of classic Three Stooges and Abbott and Costello stuff. What a rip off! See it all before!\n\nOK. Serious review. Tried to introduce this to Hue yesterday, but it didn't quite take. She likes the Stooges more, perhaps mostly because Groucho's one-liner patter is delivered too fast for her. Personally though it's Marx Bros all the way for me. Particularly Groucho.\n\nI need to revisit a few more of their classic films in the coming months, because it's been decades since I've seen them. From memory though, I'd have to agree with Roger Ebert's assessment: some of their other films have funnier individual bits, but those other films ALSO have several tedious musical/romantic interludes away from the slapstick. \n\nDuck Soup on the other hand is the most consistently sublime. And even IT isn't perfect - the story and bland supporting cast slow things down occassionally, Zeppo is more embarrassing than useful, a couple of musical numbers (while funny) drag a bit. But this is the Marx Brothers. Beautifully anarchic political-satire, covered by a divine layer of pomposity-deflating irreverence. Chico and Harpo are both awesome, but Groucho, of course, carries the film, bouncing perfectly off his femme foil Dumont, or swapping inanities with Chico, or simply spitting eternally classic one-liners out ad nasuem. Oddly, for perhaps my favourite joke-speaking comedian, my favourite Groucho bit in Duck Soup features a missing mirror, and no dialogue at all. \n\nThe man could do it all.",

He enlists the help of a wily woman as well Chico and Harpo who are spies. Chico is caught and his trial ultimately leads to war. However, he is also Firefly's secretary of War and with the Brothers leading things it is sure to be zany and wild.

Zeppo still sucks but thankfully he is hardly in it, the songs are kept to a minimum but have a large scale spectacle and funny lines and Louis Calhern as the bad guy gives it some thespian weight missing from most of the others. Highlights include Harpo's running battle with a lemonade seller that's straight out of Laurel and Hardy, Groucho's usual exasperation with Chico and the worst-spies-ever scene when they all dress up as Groucho (including the original mirror sketch).

            "content": "**** out of ****\r\n\r\nIf the Marx Brothers can't make you laugh, then I don't know who - or what - can. Since the beginning of time, comedy cinema has been dominated by the purely physical comics, some of whom mixed a little bit of verbal humor into their mix; the brothers were such people. While they were in their prime, they had many fine films; although I feel that \"Duck Soup\" is among the most important, if not the most important, period. Inside this delightful confectionary; you shall find some of the most relevant, hilarious commentary on politics, people, and their respective social classes alike - as well as a few of cinema's greatest sight gags and spoken insults. The film is a perfect representation of when comedy was neither too crude nor too subtle; it's funny enough to charm even the sourest, most cynical of viewers, so long as the person is open-minded to comedy that today might feel just a tad bit dated.\r\n\r\n\"Duck Soup\" is a straight-up satire of the people that might be leading our nations as we speak; it portrays the ruling class to be at the intelligence level of an underdeveloped ape. The story is simple and very easy to follow. Here's how I would put it: the nations of Freedonia and Sylvania are to wage war against one another. Or at least that's what their collective, current situations seem to suggest. Freedonia has just appointed a new dictator/ruler; by the name of Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx). On first sight, Firefly is far too arrogant to run a country, and don't let that fool you; he really isn't cut out for the job.\r\n\r\nThe leader of Sylvania, Trentino (Louis Calhern), is of much higher intelligence. He is worried that Firefly will get in the way of his plans to take over the opposing country of Freedonia; and he actually believes that his wits have been matched with the newest addition to the long-running list of rulers. Of course, he is wrong; but given this is a war satire, there must be coverage of the ever-infamous paranoia of leaders and those who simply follow them. Out of his paranoia, Trentino hires two spies - Chicolini (Chico Marx) and Pinky (Harpo Marx) - neither of them consistent enough to retrieve the information from Firefly that Trentino so eagerly desires.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, \"Duck Soup\" is not a film that was remembered for its plot. It's a short movie (running at about only 70 minutes), but it makes every second count. The Marx Brothers infuse their signature wit into the story, making it worthwhile; although it's the satire and commentary that counts, not so-much the structure of the plot. You want complexity; you should look elsewhere. But why should you expect such a thing out of classic comedy? In a sense, the comedy itself is meant to have multiple layers rather than the story that contains it; which is fine by me, so long as the intent to provoke laughter is not sacrificed. \r\n\r\nWhile the characters portrayed by the Brothers and their co-stars are memorable and cleverly-written, I think what most people will take out of the movie is the plethora of memorable scenes to be unearthed when one approaches it. There are a few scenes in particular that I feel most people will not soon forget; such as one involving the spies operating a peanut vendor-stand, only to pick fights with the competition in the business, and another in which Firefly walks the premises of his home in nightgown; while the spies linger nearby, also donning similar clothes. The scene is made instantly memorable when Firefly's mirror first comes into view; Pinky (dressed as Firefly) runs into it and it breaks on contact, although when the real Firefly approaches the scene, he's able to trick him by making him think that he's seeing himself in an un-broke mirror. I suppose it proves that the dimwitted spies have one thing going for them: consistency.\r\n\r\nThen, of course, there is the war scene that ends the film; a showcase of some early special effects work (such as a bullet that goes through walls, and a house that explodes), and also the home of some of the film's other scenes worth mentioning. For example: who can forget the \"help\" montage? If you've seen the film, then you know what I'm talking about; on the battlefield, Firefly calls in for assistance, and we get prolonged images of squad cars, elephants, baboons, athletic swimmers, and track runners. There's a surprising sense of relevance that this scene alone brings to the film; the kind that hasn't changed to this day. So there, you see; \"Duck Soup\" has not aged entirely. But in my opinion, \"age\" should not be a complaint of any cinephile. Greatness is forever.\r\n\r\nI loved every minute of \"Duck Soup\". You'll likely laugh until you cry when you watch it; this is a very, very funny film. From the wise-cracking Firefly to the uptight Trentino, it's filled with fun characters and humor that can range from potentially offensive (mostly to woman; not much racially or otherwise that could cause alarm) to jokes that are very easy to swallow. It's one of the best comedies reliant on what we see, hear, and feel; and I think that it broke a lot of ground for the future of comic filmmaking. And whether you acknowledge that or not is completely up to whether you buy in to the Marx Brothers' grand feathered brew.",

Quite frankly, the reason I watched it is because my mother-in-law said it is one of her favorite movies of all time and my father-in-law quoted the baboon line to me. In jest? Anyway, I had to see it. I was very sadly disappointed. The only scene I really liked was the mirror scene which I think I've seen on TV before in my childhood because it looked so familiar. (Or maybe it's been spoofed before in other movies?) Anyway, I sat there the entire movie with a straight face, trying to see where the humor was, but I did not laugh a single time. I am definitely not a slapstick humor kind of person. I definitely have a witty sense of humor but these jokes were delivered sarcastically and dryly and were mostly insults, which is not my style. I did not think this movie was funny in any way shape or form. Pinkie was REALLY annoying and I just wanted to shove him out of the movie because he was just bothering me so much.",

The film has non-stop remarkably funny gags.  Some of these jokes can be ultimatley reguarded as some of the greatest comedy scenes of all time, like the infamous mirror scene, which has not only been reused in a million other films, but also my personal favorite part of the movie.   I was laughing out loud throughout the entire hour and eight minutes.  It made me laugh harder than most comedies that have come out recentley and I think that is saying alot.\n\nI can definetley watch this movie over and over if I had to.  What makes it work so well is not the story line, but the cleaver writing and enthusiastic performances.  For me Harpo Marx as Pinky stole the show.  Everytime he cut something in half with his sisscors it didn't feel old, it somehow managed to feel new and fresh every time.\n\nThe movie didn't really feel like a masterpiece though. Since I didn't understand what happened at the end I felt I was missing some kind of meaning or conclusion.  Due to the shortness, the movie feels like it's a bit poorly edited.  But that is just a mild critisism at the most.  This movie takes comedy over plot which is great.  And all of the things I said before this are the reasons why this is currently under the list of my favorite comedies of all time.",

The ambassador from the rival nation spends the film plotting against Firefly, assigning two idiotic spies to try and dig something up on him. Like many comedies of the era, it was comedy over substance, so it in many ways plays out like a stand-up show, one joke after the other. Don't get me wrong, the jokes are very funny indeed, and there is still a lot of physical humour (the mirror scene in particular killed me), but later comedies would become more subtle and have more to them. It's very entertaining and does exactly what it says on the tin as a comedy.",
