            "content": "Rosselini shot 'Roma Citt\u00e0 Aperta' in the open streets post-war. His film-making resources were limited, as is apparent in the film, since he uses natural lighting, non-professional actors and a delicate sound system) but it only gives the film a stark and more authentic look making the atmosphere more terrifying and a the experience more real. Most of the 'props' and 'sets' and even many of the Nazi soldiers were real. Unlike many historical films, this one does right by the historical facts (even though it's a work of fiction).What is most outstanding is Rosselini's compelling storytelling. Instead of showing us a documentary account (due to lack of film-equipments) he gives us a moving story of resistance. I was also impressed by the subtle way he brought out the characters such as the homosexuality of the Nazis. He also extracts marvelous performances from his actors. Aldo Fabrizi and Anna Magnani stand out. The background score (though used minimally) adds some melodrama but not in a poor way.If one can look beyond the poor technology of the film, 'Roma Citt\u00e0 Aperta' is one of the most powerful films of its genre. Though the film may depress, and at some point horrify the viewer, the ending is profound and hopeful. In the end, it's a story about fear, courage, integrity and hope.",

            "review_title": "Powerful Portrayal of Dignity and Courage",
            "content": "Open City, a powerful Italian film directed by Roberto Rosselini in 1946, is a historically-based story of the Italian Resistance movement and its struggle against Nazi occupation. The film is a searing indictment of the Nazis and a powerful portrayal of the dignity and courage of the Italian Resistance fighters.With the city's studios destroyed, Rosselini was forced to shoot his film in the streets on stock that was purchased bit by bit, then taped together. It was shot almost immediately after the city was liberated from the Germans while the Germans still occupied the streets. Naturally, the quality of the print (although on DVD) is limited by the kind of stock that had to be used. The resulting film, however, is unique and deeply moving, and is a film of historic importance.Open City was the first of the great Italian Neo-realist films (followed by Paisan, The Bicycle Thief, Shoeshine, I Vitteloni, and Umberto D). These films were characterized by the use of non-professional actors, natural lighting, location shooting, the desire to get closer to everyday reality, and the struggle for dignity of the masses of people.Though I strongly recommend this film, there are a few minor quibbles. The Nazi leaders are portrayed as homosexuals who are associated with a decadent life style. This is contrasted with the Resistance representing the church and the family. Though I do not grant the Nazis much in the way of humanity, I think these broad strokes only obscure rather than clarify. Likewise, there is an over- identification of the Resistance as Communist. Though the Communist Party made up a good part of the Resistance, it also included Christian Democrats and Socialists.Open City, though depressing in its presentation, remains hopeful. This hope for the future is symbolized at the end of the film by the children making their way back down into the streets of Rome after witnessing an execution. This attitude is also expressed by Francesco as he talks to Pina (Anna Magnani) in the flats, \"We must believe it, we must want it,, We musn't be afraid because we are on the just path.We're fighting for something that must come. It may be long..it may be difficult, but there'll be a better world.\"56 years later, we're still waiting.",

            "content": "The experience of defeat and occupation with the daily humiliations, was happily not one that the Americans or British had to undergo... But for those countries which did suffer under the frame of foreign oppression\u0097France, Italy, Czechoslovakia and Poland\u0097the experience left a heritage of bitterness deeply evident in their films...Italy, however, was a special and unusual case: it was occupied by two opposing armies\u0097the German and the American\u0097 at the same time... And as neither side trusted the Italians they were left to get on with their own internal political quarrels of partisans versus fascist, within the limits, of course, of occupation...It was these experiences that Roberto Rossellini recorded in his trilogy about war\u0097 'Rome, Open City', 'Pais\u00e1,' and 'Germany Year Zero.'Rossellini called 'Rome, Open City' a film about 'fear, everyone's fear, but above all my own.'Made under difficult a penurious circumstances towards the war's end, the film captures with an astonishing consciousness the whole experience... There is no need to recreate anything for it is all there, in the ruined buildings and in the people's faces... Rossellini had 'planted the camera in the middle of real life' and so spearheaded the Neo-realist film revival...But Rossellini did more than just film things as they were... His creative genius molded what existed into a film of overpowering impact, an impact which does not recede with the passing of years... Out of his own particular situation he has created a magnificent story of resistance both concrete and spiritual which could not be broken by force... And in fact, it is only broken by the promise of luxury: Marina betrays her lover because she has been caught up in the decadence of the oppressor's world... But Manfredi when caught does not crack under the brutal torture... Rossellini endows all those who resist, whether Communist or Catholic, with a special kind of purity... Manfredi, Francesco, Pina (played by the magnificent Anna Magnani), and the children all seem to have drunk of the same deep and clear well of faith... We see this especially in the priest, Don Pietro (Aldo Fabrizi), a kind man, wedded to a faith which obviously based on a true Christian humility... His humble activities as resistance worker only underline what he is already... 'It is my duty to help those who need it,' he answers when asked why he is taking such great risks... And when he is captured and tortured by the Gestapo he accepts his fate: 'It is not difficult to die well. It is difficult to live well.'",

He escapes looking for fellow fighter Francesco and finds his pregnant fianc\u00e9e Pina. Catholic priest Don Pietro Pellegrini helps but he's under surveillance.It's a minor miracle that Roberto Rossellini achieved so much so soon after the end of the war. On the other hand, when Pina points to a bomb damaged building, a bomb probably did damage that building. It is considered a great example of neorealism although he had fewer unreal sets that he could use anyway. The one scene where Pina is chasing after Francesco being arrested is one of the great scenes of cinema. It is dynamic and visceral. One can really feel the action more than most war action scenes of its time.",

Rossellini did not have money even to buy the negatives, which were given by his friends. He used ordinary people and real locations to shot the film, making a very authentic and realistic movie as if it were a documentary, and the negatives were only revealed in the end of the shootings.

            "content": "\"Roma, citta aperta\" is a film that cries for a Martin Scorsese to come to its aid in restoring it. There are sequences that are barely visible, as proved by the recent showing on the Sundance channel. Roberto Rossellini deserves better. We are even surprised that his own daughter, Isabella, so well connected with the world of cinema, has not done more to champion the restoration of this masterpiece.Most comments in IMDb dismiss the film without taking in consideration the impact it had when it made its debut. If not for anything, the people that worked in the period of the post war, took advantage in showing a reality to the viewers and revolutionized the Italian cinema forever. The neo-realists were notorious for engaging non-actors to portray the characters they created. It's easy to be critical of those movies that came out during those years and make comparisons based on today's tastes.Roberto Rossellini was a genius who saw the movie industry destroyed during the terrible WWII days. Out of the necessity, the neo-realism style came into being. Directors from that period saw the opportunity to do things differently by bringing the actual filming into the streets of Italy. It was a way for making movies that didn't conform to the established rules up to that point.\"Roma, citta aperta\" was Rossellini's way for analyzing what went wrong in his country. One the one hand he presents us the forces of evil, in this case the Germans, that wanted to the oppressed masses, the Italians, in a story that puts them at odds and that would favor the enemy because they had the power and their country's leader was collaborating with the invading forces.There is a sublime appearance by Anna Magnani, perhaps the best Italian actress of all times, that is worth the price of admission. Even though she only appears for a short period, her presence looms large in the film and in our heart. We watch, horrified, as Pina runs after the truck where Francesco is being hauled to prison for a fate that seemed clear to Pina. That sequence will remain one of Rossellini's best achievements.Rossellini also shows how demoralized the Germans were. There are also hints of homosexuality, as well as lesbianism, in the movie. This fact, also plays in our consciousness as to how we perceive them. The betrayal of Pina's sister shows how some people collaborated with the enemy in order to get the material things they couldn't get otherwise.In addition to Anna Magnani, there are great appearances by Aldo Fabrizi, Marcello Pagliero, Nando Bruno, Giovanna Galletti, and Henry Feist. The music score is by Renzo Rossellini which plays well with the story. Ubaldo Arata's cinematography stands to be enjoyed more if the film would be restored to its original glory.This was Roberto Rossellini's masterpiece.",

            "review_title": "Good",
            "content": "Rome Open City is a good film, but it is clearly a far more historically important film than an artistically great one (the predominance of hagiography and agitprop make this almost inevitable). Too many times its lead characters, be they Italians or Germans, good guys or bad guys, fall into stereotypes, and the action plunges into melodrama. Pina's senseless death is the best example, as she would truly have to be stupid to do such a thing in real life, with her son right there. But, it does set up the rest of the film's drama and narrative pieces. And there can be some rightful criticism of the film's dishonest portrayal of the Italian Resistance (which was virtually nothing in comparison to the French Resistance), culpability for the Second World War, and relative prosperity and lack of internal destruction versus other European nations. Nonetheless, the film did sweep the Cannes Film Festival and many others worldwide, and it has a number of touches that redeem its clich\u00e9s, such as having Don Pietro's glasses be broken so that he can only hear, not see, Manfredi's slow death, or the literal killing of two lambs by the Nazis right before Marina betrays Manfredi, which, in its rendering is far more affecting than in its mere description. It should also be mentioned that in a brief scene, an Italian tot's naked bottom half (including genitalia) is shown, which both adds to the claims of realism, and satisfies the dramatic arc of the moment, highlighting how silly most censored scenes and moments in film are. Rome Open City does not broach greatness, but it does entertain and inspire, even almost two thirds of a century after its conception, and sometimes that's something which has even more effect than hermetic greatness. So, ciao, and it's on to Paisan!",

            "content": "Photographed on scraps of film abandoned by German forces as they retreated from Rome toward the end of World War II, Roberto Rossellini's OPEN CITY was immediately hailed as a masterpiece of realism when it hit screens around the world in the late 1940s. Seen within the context of its time and with reference to the circumstances under which it was made, OPEN CITY is a staggering accomplishment; even so, by modern standards, it feels visually static and slightly contrived.The great strength of the film is in the direct way Rossellini tells his story of Italian resistance fighters trying to dodge capture by the Nazis in occupied Rome--and in the performances of Anna Magnani and Aldo Fabrizi as two Italians who become increasingly caught up in resistance activities. But time has not been entirely kind to the film: the story seems somewhat superficial, portions of it lack expected intensity, and some performances seem more than a little artificial, with a lesbian subplot, the famous torture scenes, and Maria Mitchi's performance cases in point.Ironically, these drawbacks actually result from comparisons with later, still more realistic films that followed its example--and it is a great tribute to the strength of the film that it survives the revolution it started as well as it does. (One does well to recall that at the time OPEN CITY was made such slick Hollywood films as MRS. MINIVER were considered the height of realism.) Still, because of these issues I would hesitate to recommend OPEN CITY as an introduction to Italian neo-realism for one not already well-versed in it. But those with an established appreciation of Italian cinema will find it very rewarding.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",

            "review_title": "Other interpretations",
            "content": "Over time, Rossellini's legacy has been overshadowed by that of his contemporaries Fellini and de Sica.  There are reasons for this.  Fellini had a unique cinematographic eye and a gift for abstract symbolism.  De Sica was able to capture the incidental and indeterminate in a way that practically elevated it to the level of the holy.  His use of non-actors was far more effective than Rossellini's, as was Fellini's use of actors. Rossellini's scripts were often two-dimensional, his cinematography spotty and his editing odd.  So why is it that he occupies a leading position among Italian auteurs?In fact, Rossellini was not a neo-realist, but a realist.  Compared with products of the neo-realists, his films are thin and wooden.  If, on the other hand, one views them as works of tragedy, they are excellent.  From the very start of Open City, it is clear that the seeds of disaster are sewn.  A pregnant mother is to be married to a member of the resistance. Members of the clergy and children are also involved in fighting the Nazis. Italians are united against a common enemy: Fascism.  Yet we know that, while victory is inevitable, so is death.  Perhaps it is the darkness of the tight, seedy interiors that tips us off.  Perhaps it is because we do not feel that sense of endlessness beyond the screen, but that we are being led through these building and streets along with the characters.  Perhaps is is the German marching songs.  Whatever it is, we feel the march of destiny leading us to some terrible conclusion.  Fate can never play a role in neo-realist work; by Bazin's definition, it is constructed organically and arrives at its destination as if by chance.  Tragedy can only be the purview of the realist.Open City is not without its liabilities.  For one, Arata's cinematography, while startling at times, is unsatisfactory at others.  The script, written by Fellini and Amidei, is confusing and allows for minimal character development.  [N.B.: The English subtitles add to this confusion, excising whole chunks of crucial dialogue.]  Several of the performances are undynamic, such as those of Maria Michi and Carla Rovere; the villains, portrayed by Giovanna Gallett and Harry Feist, are very much \"in type\"; Aldo Fabrizi, who, as Don Pietro, is so central to the plot, is guilty of overacting.  Above all, one doesn't get the sense that Rossellini's camera \"falls in love\" with its subjects the way that one might wish it did.  Yet it is in this very impassiveness, this plastic script and detached camera, that the key to Open City lies.  This is not a film about a painter and his son, nor does it lovingly portray an old pensioner and his dog.  This film is about the horrors of war, not a subject for which Rossellini expects to find an empathetic audience.  In the absence of footlights and the invisible \"third wall\", he uses the greatest tool at his disposal to create tragic theater: our own lack of nobility.Open City is a portrait of human courage in the face of overwhelming odds. It confronts us with horrors which, God willing, we may never know.  Don't watch it expecting to fall in love with the grittiness of World War II era Italy.  Expect to be deeply moved.",

In fact, it was so recent that allegedly real German POWs were used as actors, and the man credited as the editor was actually in prison at the time. That is wild.Sadly, the version I watched was of a fairly low quality. I suspect most (if not all) releases are. Is this fixable?

            "review_title": "\"It would mean an Italian is worth as much as a German\"",
            "content": "On its initial release, Roberto Rossellini's 'Rome, Open City (1945)' was hailed for its harrowing documentary realism, sharing the 1946 Palme d'Or, and even today it is regarded as the type specimen of Italian neorealism, a movement that produced such treasures as 'The Bicycle Thief (1948)' and 'Umberto D. (1952).' The film's photographic style, which is coarse and unstylised, could certainly be considered classically neorealistic, as could Rossellini's unavoidable preoccupation with Italy's fascist history and war-time devastation. One might suggest that the film's unexceptional film-making technique was imposed upon Rossellini rather than being an entirely deliberate artistic decision; the Germans had only just withdrawn from Rome, and its citizens were still reeling from years of Nazi occupation and Allied bombing. Just as Carol Reed filmed 'The Third Man (1949)' amid the crumbling ruins of war-torn Vienna, Rossellini uses the backdrop of a fallen city to emphasise the disintegration of a formerly unified nation, now surviving only in fragmented patches of human spirit that must now be forged back together again.Rossellini's film is most often praised for its realism, and for its primary focus on the ordinary citizens of Rome. However, during the film's first half, I didn't find this approach entirely successful. Rather than centering the film intimately on one or two characters, as Vittorio De Sicae did in his two well-known neorealist films, 'Open City' instead jumps from one to another, manufacturing a sense of unity among the oppressed citizens of Rome, but also diluting the viewer's ability to identify with any one character. In this sense, the film is similar to Pontecorvo's 'The Battle of Algiers (1966),' or even Eisenstein's 'Battleship Potemkin (1925),' in that individual characters hold lesser prominence than the ideals for which they are fighting. Suggesting that the art of neorealism took several years to perfect, Rossellini also occasionally veers towards melodrama. Scenes involving the arrogant Major Bergmann (Harry Feist) establish a simplistic \"us versus them\" mentality, offering Germany as the outright villain in a manner similar to that of any early 1940s American propaganda film.I must admit that I found myself less-than-captivated during the film's opening half, perhaps because Rossellini wouldn't focus exclusively on any one character. The most interesting moments were those tinged with drama \u2013 a German soldier unexpectedly removes a gun from his pocket, a terrorist bomb shakes the city buildings. But if I had any doubts about the director's technique, then the harrowing realism of Anna Magnani's death, photographed as though through the lens of a bystanding newsreel camera, without any dramatic fanfare or unnecessary cinematic punctuation, convinced me of its merits. Notably, Rossellini deviates towards drama in his film's second half, but I considered this an improvement, my complete sympathy now directed towards a specific character, the dignified Roman priest Don Pietro (Aldo Fabrizi). The German treatment of captured rebels is unflinching in its hostility, including a prolonged torture session with a blow-torch, and a sombre firing squad execution as city children watch on with downcast eyes. Interestingly, Rossellini doesn't end the film with an Italian victory, as might be expected. The misery lingers; any victory could only be hollow.",

Stock good guys and bad guys fill the screen, and the sombre tone of it all trumps any truly objective attempt to critique it according to some dispassionate set of standards. The fact that it was made at all and continues to be shown to appreciative audiences via cable television speaks for itself.The strength of the production lies indeed in powerful individual scenes and some inspired acting. It captures attention from the beginning and holds the viewer rapt until the final minutes, even though the cinematic values are at best crude, requiring a forgiving eye. One identifies easily with its emotional force.That said, its shortcomings are rather obvious. The Nazis are mainly not native speakers of German, with accents ranging from Dutch to Italian, and the one German officer who speaks ill of the \"master race\" is in his cups rather than a sober judge of the evil around him. The viewer would do well to remember that fascism in Italy was a homegrown phenomenon well before the Germans took over the show in 1944. Note how the Red Menace is thrown in the face of patriotic Italians as a ploy to gain their acquiescence to Nazi control. Elements of moral decadence among the evildoers likewise diminishes rather than enhances the proposition that they are rational perpetrators of that evil, bent on excusing their acts by twisting the truth to suit their own agenda.Yet this was a contemporaneous Italian reflection on fresh history, and that cannot be faulted by 21st Century revisionists. It also restored a vital industry to Italy, and presaged many great films that followed it.",

            "content": "This is such an important work even the Vatican now includes it in its list of great films (no doubt for the self-sacrificing priest). It features in sundry other lists, an obligatory stop it would seem for anyone wanting to sample the works that defined film.By now you know it as a classic that heralded a whole new mode of filmmaking in Italy and abroad, more 'real' and immediate than the studio artifice of before, taking place in open streets, using non-actors, relying more on improvisation than script. Sitting down to watch this now however, you'll be confronted with something quite melodramatic, scripted and acted in the usual way. An early scene for example where people ransack a baker's shop for food you'll be able to tell as the scripted dramatization of food shortages rather than something that can steal into you as visceral and improvised. By this I mean the whole stagecraft is obvious and doesn't feel all that different from a studio movie.In spite of some of Rossellini's efforts, our distance from these Rome streets where real people were suffering only months before through events much like we see in the film is simply not as close as you would perhaps expect.In part that's because our own viewing has shifted since. WWII movies are now common film lore. This was the first of its kind, if we exclude documentaries during the war or jingoist propaganda. Work began only months after actual Nazis had been evacuated from these same streets. War was still booming elsewhere in Europe.But even more important for me, I don't think Rossellini was setting out to revolutionize. Realism in this case meant chronicling very close to real events rather than a radically 'real' light in which to do so. The urgency of the effort would have been enough to deal with I'm sure.It's this urgency to stage events so close in time that inadvertently becomes mirrored in the film itself. This, rather than a story of defiance against Nazil evil, now seeming ordinary and usual because of how familiar, is what I find the most vital thing here.The film is about rival groups trying to stage events and assert control over them around the city. Members of the resistance sneak from house to house trying to evade capture. Meanwhile the Gestapo is scouring the city for them.The first have to spontaneously improvise on the spot, make narrow escapes, act roles and create fiction around the authorities. The Germans are rigidly controlled by a Nazi director who never leaves his office. It takes a spurned lover, judging her for how she lives, to give them away.There are of course scenes that still affect. The one that begins with Nazis rounding up of tenants from a tenement and ends with Anna Magnani chasing after a truck would be my favorite here. The ending with a prisoner being tortured to confess must have been a powerful depiction at the time, but it's also part of a melodramatic climax.",

            "content": "The beginning for me felt quite slow and uneventful, as is characteristic of Italian neorealism. Italian neorealism likes to establish the normality of everyday activities which expresses the lives of locals, and being a pretty fast-paced person I did not like this much. Also, the dialogue delivery was a little awkward at first, but perhaps this could be a cultural difference in speech and conversation.The acting was quite good. Magnani plays her part well, and her chemistry with Annichiarico is prominent, though not the same can be said between her and Francesco. She gives a moving performance in her last scene as well, with her desperation and emotions traversing the screen. Fabrizi as well gets into the shoes of his character well and plays the part of the priest convincingly. Francesco and Pagliero as part of the resistance to the Nazi occupiers don't really seem to be doing anything but talk. Understandably, they have to be cautious but I don't believe I actually saw them 'resisting' anything except via words. Well, there was an exchange with other rebels but it just seemed like they were pretty inactive. Additionally, some characters are well developed, while others are ambiguous or stereotypical. Pina seems to be the protagonist and her character is pretty well established but she doesn't carry the narrative (not in the second half anyway). Don Pietro is another well established character who has no surprises. Francesco and Manfredi are depicted as the heroes but not in the conventional sense (as they don't do heroic stunts), and the other female characters in the film are shallow and presented as stereotypes. The story doesn't flow in one continuous movement, and more or less feels like it plods along. There is a clear linear narrative, but it was just a little slow in the first half. Plus, there are a few discrepancies and ambiguity to what happens to some characters. I'm not sure if I missed some scenes (admittedly I fell asleep for a few minutes), but Francesco's character just disappears. Apart from that, there are some very saddening scenes which make this film quite depressing. Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",

            "review_title": "Legendary Italian masterpiece with Italian screen legend",
            "content": "\"It is easy to die with dignity, it is much harder to live with dignity\" (Padre Pietro)Usually when I encounter commenting on WWII movies, I have mixed feelings. I am aware that it's hardly possible to fully evaluate their intensely diverse levels. The situation occurs even harder when commenting on such a legendary movie as ROMA CITTA APERTA. It seems that it is easier to end about it well but much harder to say about it so. Rossellini's movie is one of the true masterpieces dealing with WWII, a symbol of Italian Neorealism, a wonderful psychological insight into individual and social deeds. Moreover, it is the film made just in the core of those events, the Rome of the mid-1940s. All latest movies on WWII, though very well made, seem pale and only acted when comparing to this one. Let me discuss the movie in more details.ROMA CITTA APERTA is a true INSIGHT into various CHARACTERS in their hard REALITIES that force them to particular deeds. They all cope with resistance from the German fascists who divided Rome into 14 zones and control it. The characters range from the simple Il Sagrestano, the engaged couple Francesco and Pina, young boys, devoted Padre Pietro, performer Marina to the most \"wanted\" man Giorgio Manfredi (a true character, the Communist Celeste Negavilla). They all cope with individual dramas combined with psychological tiredness: Pina plans to set up a family, yet fatal events of hatred do not allow for her happiness; one of the boys badly seeks a father, yet the army of death does not accept fathers or sons; some want careers as performers, yet the times force service to blind propaganda only; good Christians want to live with dignity and love, yet, the world can only offer humiliation and hatred in return. The satanic patience of the Nazis seems to win. And here arises a question: are they all forced to do things they'd never do?... That profound development of characters, though may seem too harsh for Germans, occurs to be especially thought provoking and psychological.ROMA CITTA APERTA is filled with GENUINELY TOUCHING MOMENTS. Except for the final scene - the symbol of the movie when the sad boys walk to the city of Rome just after the execution=martyrdom of their earthly angelic tutor, Padre Pietro; I'll never forget Pina's death: supposedly so unnecessary as a loss of life but truly so significant as a cry for freedom and dignity. Anna Magnani does a terrific job in this scene, you as a viewer seem to shout with her in despair: \"Francesco!\" Another great moment is when Marcello, Pina's son, asks Francesco \"Can I call you father?\" This seems to symbolize that simple affection never dies and remains a genuine sign of hope in the world of madness and hatred. Besides, who can forget the moment when Francesco places hope in Pina that the future would bring life anew, dreams anew, happiness more stable. Throughout these moments, there is an intense atmosphere, something that keeps you on your chair speechless.ROMA CITTA APERTA stands out as a movie with a very clever and profound SCRIPT. It thrilled me when Bergmann, with satanic irony, says to Padre Pietro \"I DO NOT care about your rules!\" and Padre answers calmly \"But the One above you and me DOES\" Hartmann's reflections on Nazis' deeds constitute an accurate psychology of doubt even among these \"monsters\". His character also atones a bit for the image of the Germans. But the final words about living and dying in dignity are the quintessential of the movie and leave a timeless message. But all the word \"masterwork\" sums up in another crucial aspect.ROMA CITTA APERTA is one great harmony of flawless PERFORMANCES. Who comes to view as the superior cast is of course the unforgettable Anna Magnani. Her symbolic role of Pina representing the despair of the nation is one of the greatest masterpieces one can encounter in the history of cinema. I do not exaggerate: Anna does something above flawless acting: she IS Pina! Aldo Fabrizi gives a profound performance as Il Padre stressing right Christian attitude filled with love, justice, openness. Harry Feist does a terrific job as wretched Nazi officer Bergmann and Maria Michi as Marina of the Piburtina Street. This film deserves to bear a name \"masterpiece\" thanks to performances alone.ROMA CITTA APERTA is undeniably one of the most precious pearls of human thought in cinema. It lifts up the mind and soul, beside all its content of war, death and cruelty, it still fills our minds with hope of the better world. Yet, eternal walk of humanity towards the gates of peace has not finished yet. However, as long as there are viewers who acquire the spirit of this movie, such walk does not occur in vain.Oh Rome, the Eternal City, the Beloved City, the Historic Treasure of Humanity, Open Your Gates to Peace, Open the Gates of All Human Hearts!",

            "review_title": "Rossellini's Frank Picture of Italian Despair",
            "content": "Roberto Rossellini's \"Open City\" is a bleak and surprisingly (for 1945) brutal film documenting the efforts of Italy's underground resistance against the fascists in World War II. Filmed on location amid the streets of Rome, it looks ragged and gritty, and much more aged than other films from the same time period, but given its subject matter and the history of its making, I wouldn't have it any other way.Anna Magnani is probably the most recognizable actor in the film -- she would go on to win an Academy Award ten years later for her performance in \"The Rose Tattoo.\" But part of the film's appeal is that the people in it don't look or feel like actors, which makes the events in it feel that more immediate, like they're happening to real people.The movie does get a little heavy handed in its depiction of the Germans as sadistic animals, but I think this can be forgiven, since Rossellini was making this film even while Germans were occupying Italy. But mostly, it's a a blunt illustration of the Italian people's despair, and their struggle to retain a grip on their dignity, even while that dignity was being tortured (in one scene, quite literally) out of them.This film would make a great double feature with \"Army of Shadows,\" Jean Pierre Melville's 1969 film about the French resistance. Be warned, however, that you wouldn't win any awards for putting together the feel-good double feature of the year.Grade: A",

            "review_title": "Groundbreaking Slice of Neo-Realist Cinema Depicting the Horrors of the German Occupation of Italy",
            "content": "Filmed under extreme circumstances in the aftermath of the German withdrawal, ROME: OPEN CITY tells a straightforward tale of Resistance fighters battling against the Nazi occupiers. Three of them are eventually caught, including the priest Don Pietro Pellegrini (Aldo Fabrizi) and hanged, tortured or forced to commit suicide. Meanwhile Pina (Anna Magnani) is shot down in cold blood after she tries to rescue her prospective husband Manfredi (Marcello Pagliero).This bald plot-summary cannot do justice to a film that is quite simply brilliant. Although classed as a neo-realist piece, director Roberto Rossellini does not favor the extensive use of pans or long- shots to establish the situations; there are comparatively few shots of a war-destroyed Rome, except at the film's end. Instead Rossellini uses a more domestic palette, with plenty of shots of dilapidated apartment-blocks in dire need of restoration, or seedy rooms where the Resistance fighters hatch their plans. The streets are desolate, peopled only by a few horses and carts - apart from the occasion when a Nazi force comes to root out their enemies, accompanied by their superior officers in expensive-looking cars. Contrast the desolation of the Roman streets with the opulence of the Nazi quarters, where the sadistic interrogator Major Bergmann (Harry Feist) takes his mind off torturing his enemies by sipping brandies and listening to soft piano music while placing a paternal arm round his girlfriend. Even though their days of occupation might be numbered, there is no reason why they should not continue to enjoy the high life.The film contains some memorable sequences, photographed by Ubaldo Arata. As the Nazi troops search for their enemies in an apartment block, the camera tilts upwards to show the apparently endless flights of stairs. The action cuts to the priest and the little boy Francesco (Francesco Grandjacquet) looking down the flights of stairs to ascertain where the troops are. The effect is dizzying, making us aware of the impending sense of danger. Later on Pina's death-scene is also memorably filmed, as she runs towards a tracking camera in a futile attempt to rescue her fianc\u00e9. A shot rings out, and she crumples to the ground; the camera immediately switches to a medium close-up of Manfredi's horrified face (as he is taken away by the Nazis) followed by another tracking shot of Francesco running out from the crowd towards his dead mother, screaming wildly.The torture-scenes still remain difficult to watch. We do not actually see anything bloody; instead Rossellini achieves his dramatic effect through Manfredi's screams on the soundtrack intercut with the Priest's horrified countenance as he witnesses what is happening. The Nazis know no bounds when it comes to extracting information out of their victims. It is a tribute to Manfredi's stoicism that he refuses to talk under any form of duress.The final sequence is also memorable as the Priest is executed by firing-squad in a lonely field outside the city. Rossellini uses a group-shot of local children burying their heads in their hands as they hear the fatal shot to achieve his dramatic effect. To the accompaniment of dramatic music (by Renzo Rossellini) he cuts to a long shot of the ruined city as the action draws to a close. The only way to endure occupation is through resistance and stoicism, even under the most extreme pressure.If we wanted to be reminded of what life was truly like under the Third Reich, ROME: OPEN CITY is a seminal text.",

            "review_title": "Flawed but still powerful",
            "content": "From what I understand, it's amazing this film was made at all. Its scenes of great power and its message of perseverance make it memorable, and the context of Rossellini having started to film it four months before VE day is mind-boggling. The scene with the young woman (Pina, played by Anna Magnani) in the street and the scenes of torture hit notes of heartbreaking pathos and soaring courage. To hear a resistance fighter say this is stirring, and maybe it's what people of all countries had to cling to through this long and painful war:\"We mustn't be afraid now or in the future, because we're on the just path. Understand, Pina? We're fighting for something that has to be, that can't help coming. The road may be long and hard, but we'll get there, and we'll see a better world. And our children especially will see it - Marcello and the one on the way.\"One of the problems I had with the film was it's having apparently given Italy a pass in terms of its own fascism and for having helped in bringing about a horrific war. As I thought about it, though, I realized that this culpability may be ever so lightly touched upon in a line from the priest, in response to the question \"Doesn't Christ see us?\" He says, \"Are we sure we haven't deserved this scourge? Are we sure we've always lived according to the Lord's laws?\" It's a line that I am normally nauseated by, since it's wielded against the innocent in an Old Testament kind of way, e.g. those suffering from natural disasters or things like the AIDS crisis, and in this instance, it also seems to be wielded against poor Pina by this sanctimonious priest, who is (of course) oblivious to the Catholic Church's own troubling history with Nazi Germany under Pius XII. The anger I initially felt during this scene blinded me to what may have been its intention, pointing out that everyday Italians are suffering because (minimally through their leaders) they brought it upon themselves. In that light, it's deeply moving. I'm still not sure that was the intention though, and extract the full quote below. Regardless, the semblance of real introspection is at best far too oblique, and at worst, absent entirely.There is no doubt that the film also suffers from its depiction of good (most Italians) and evil (the Germans). The two main partisans, the fianc\u00e9 of one of them, and the priest are all incredibly pure, faithful, and pious. Meanwhile, the Nazis are shown as homosexuals (ugh) abetted by an Italian woman who betrays her people for material possessions (she's also prostituted herself and been involved with the lesbian German, apparently in an effort to demonize the female temptress in as many ways as possible). Not content with that, one of the German officers has these words put in his mouth:\"We Germans refuse to realize that people want to be free. ... I drink every night to forget, but it only makes me see more clearly. All we're really good at is killing, killing, killing! We've strewn all of Europe with corpses, and from their graves rises up an unquenchable hatred. Hatred ... hatred everywhere! That hatred will devour us. There's no hope. ... We'll all die without the slightest hope.\"It's ludicrous and a failure artistically in this regard. The film's intertwining of religious faith with the bravery of the resistance leaders as being the hope that Italy will endure was obviously deeply meaningful to a devout nation, but it's less meaningful to me personally, and in some ways, borderline offensive as I allude to above. These are the things that kept the film good-but-not-great for me personally. Had it been made in the 1950's I would have rated it as 7 stars, but to have been made in 1945 as part of the vanguard of neorealism, I bump it up a bit, and I'm certainly glad I saw it.Here's the full exchange:\n\"And life just keeps getting harder. How will we ever forget all this suffering, anxiety, and fear? Doesn't Christ see us?\"\n\"So many people ask me that: 'Doesn't Christ see us?' But are we sure we haven't deserved this scourge? Are we sure we've always lived according to the Lord's laws? People never think of changing their ways, but when the piper must be paid, they despair and ask 'Doesn't the Lord see us? Doesn't he take pity on us?' Yes, he does, but we have so much to be forgiven for, and for that we must pray and forgive much.\"\n\"You're right, but how do we forgive? I see those guys (cut to three Nazis checking an Italian man's papers) and I want to smash their faces in.\"",

(And it's amazing how many people there are who would gladly sell their soul, if only there were a buyer. Unfortunately, one sometimes doesn't have to look too far to find a buyer.) This film is about the struggle for human souls. In the end, it's an inside job; it's really that simple.

            "content": "I heard of Roberto Rossellini's first neo-realist (neo-realist before it was defined, however, meaning it borders on factual melodrama) effort, Roma Citta Aperta, or Open City, through the documentary My Voyage to Italy. From the way it was seen in that it had my expectations so high that when I finally saw it today I was only slightly disappointed. I realize that Rossellini works in a different realism than like Vittorio DeSica. The viewer sees right away that DeSica works much better in getting the tragedy of the emotional levels of these people, while Rossellini gets the tragedy of the situation(s) at hand. At it's purest and best, Open City tells a solid story about simple people in harrowing times. At his core, Rossellini films Open City a lot like a documentary, with some shots here and there that you didn't see at the time - all of the locations were real from weeks after the war ended and created the appropriate atmosphere. And yet, despite the truth to the story (of a Priest being executed by the fascists), every now and then I found myself looking at Open City like it should have been better, that it hasn't held up against time like DeSica's films did. I was able to look past some of the faults, but not enough to make me think of this as a masterpiece like many critics and admirers say.Still, the main theme that goes with Open City, the loyalty of the common people, is not lost on a modern viewer such as me- the priest Don Pietro Pelligrini (Aldo Fabrizi), along with some children who are also resistance fighters, try and help those who are trying to rid Rome and Italy of the German presence. There is also Francesco, who has a couple of aliases, and wants to marry Pina (Anna Magnani, in the most heart-felt performance of the film) since she's pregnant. The events in the second and third acts of the film are worth watching, though the first act slowly introducing several supporting players takes its time showing us these are real people who've lived through the war and are sick of waiting for the end of it. I'm not too sure now if I can recommend Open City as THE definitive neo-realist film, because it was made before neo-realism had found its footing. It is an important film to see, I don't doubt that, and the last twenty minutes of the film contain some of the most memorable material in the neo-realism movement (these twenty minutes give Fabrizi time to prove his worth). Even as a regular war film I got what I wanted...Perhaps I need to see another one of Rossellini's works, like Paisan, The Miracle, or Germany Year Zero before, I know if his breakthrough was his best effort as a director and/or to the genre he helped create.Author's note: one aspect that hindered my enjoyment of watching Open City was that, despite seeing it on DVD, the print of the film was sub-par, and the subtitles that accompanied it only contained about 75% of what was spoken. There was one line in particular towards the very end that I remembered from a clip shown in the documentary that was left out, which was a downer for such a powerful scene. Like the film or not, this needs Criterion collection treatment.",

The movie is full of the most obvious stereotypical characters and formulaic situations, common to war-time movies.The story centers around Aldo Fabrizi as an unprepossessing and humble priest who helps the anti-Fascists in minor ways, but it's really an ensemble movie and Anna Magnanni, with her strong features and forceful yet vulnerable persona, plays a prominent role.Fabrizi is just fine, a flabby presence. He visits a shop and asks about the statue of a particular saint. The proprietor doesn't have that saint, but how about St. Roche over here? A beautiful representation, don't you think? Fabrizi stares at the little icon on the table without enthusiasm. Then he notices the statue of a nude woman next to that of the saint. With a barely perceptible shudder, he turns the woman's figure away from that of Saint Roche. But then he realizes that St. Roche is now staring at the woman's naked behind, so he adjusts St. Roche according to his precepts. His practical humanity makes his much less than operatic end that much more of a tragedy.If Fabrizi is the man trying to help others in distress -- he forges papers for deserters from the German Army, that sort of thing -- Anna Magnanni is the force trying to hold things together in a world that has become almost entirely unpredictable. She has a child. She's about to marry a good man who belongs to the resistance. Then the Germans intervene and that fake stability is utterly destroyed.The Germans could have come out of any flag-waver from an Allied country. First of all, the major who runs the show is effete and swishy. He's pale, his hair is gelled, and he smokes like a woman and seems to mince even when he's standing still. He has a woman agent whose job is to infiltrate the resistance and get them to squeal on each other. We meet her when someone opens a door and we see this villainous woman with deep shadows over her eyes, literally standing in a cloud of cigarette smoke. She's not only a duplicitous fiend who preys on the weak. She's a lesbian too.And then there are the scenes of torture and the speeches that go with them. \"We must make him speak by tomorrow.\" Why? \"If he doesn't speak by then he will have proved himself as good as a member of the Master Race, instead of belonging to the Slave Race.\" One of the German officers gets drunk and mocks the Master Race business and makes a speech. Then there's the execution, with the patriotic boys witnessing it and whistling a song of freedom for the victim.But for all that formulaic content, it's a gripping story about people of no special consequence. The performances, professional or otherwise, are convincing. In recent years many of us in the West have begun talking about the dark night of Fascism descending on America or some other country -- as if we knew what it meant.",

Regardless of its historic importance in the development of cinema, Open City is a difficult film to watch. For one, the neo-realist style was not fully developed. It struck me as more non-professional and low-budget than realistic. Certainly it doesn't have the dramatic appeal of a Battle of Algiers or pack an emotional wallop like The Bicycle Thief. Unfortunately, not much happens. The narrative is very choppy and while I appreciate the tremendous difficulties Rossellini must have faced to complete the film, the end result is not very watchable. The German officer is very unrealistically portrayed as well. I haven't seen any other Rossellini film and doubt I will. The typical complaints I have with Open City, poor narrative flow, stilted acting, no emotional appeal and slow pace all register with many of his other films as well. There is a very small Martin Scorcese documentary as the only DVD extra which isn't much of an incentive to rent the movie.",

            "content": "It is debatable whether or not this movie is worthy of its title of early masterpiece from Roberto Rossellini but fact remains that this movie is simply a great movie about a real tough and dark period.What foremost makes this so unique was that it got made so soon after the actual end of WW II and the end of reign of fascism. Therefore the overall feel and look of the movie seems very authentic. Basically all people involved in this movie in front and behind the cameras had to really go through the period as portrayed in this movie. There also weren't too many anti-Nazi movies around yet during that them, at least not movies that got made in Italy itself. This is one of the very first that shows the horrors the common Italian population had to go through and how a brave few tried to make a difference by fighting the fascist enemies.It's a movie that features the common WW II movie ingredients focusing on the underground resistance, such as courage, loyalty and betrayal. In that way this movie is a real typical WW II, of which still so many get made. So perhaps in todays light this movie has to offer than it did in 1945. Not that it makes the movie worse though. Still I feel that the movie story could had been a bit more interesting and focused a more clear main plot-line and 'point' so to speak. But that's just not really the Italian-way.The movie is made in a real typical Italian cinematic way, which means that it's slow at times and also heavily leans and depends on its leading characters. Not that that's a complaint though, since the movie really features some great characters who also get portrayed by some real capable actors.The movie hasn't aged too well though, in terms of its picture quality. The movie could really use a restoration and re-release. Who knows, some day we might get lucky.The movie shows that Roberto Rossellini was really a great director, who knew how to tell a story, with an eye for detail and realism.It's not the most effective or intriguing WW II movie I've ever seen but it comes close enough.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "review_title": "When War brings the best and the worst of humanity...",
            "content": "It holds an odd but very understandable significance that one of the most impacting post-World War II movies ever was from Italy. I say \"odd\" because Italy is perhaps the only country that started as an ally to Germany before being invaded by her very ally (not to mention the real ones) in 1943 after the fall of Mussolini. It was the failure of the fascist dream that left Italy an open country for the German invasion, with the capital Rome, as an open city.Italians saw their country literally collapsing, their fleet annihilated, the North African campaign cut short by the Allies, Italy relegated to the ungrateful small-time role in the scale of World War II, a casting error that cost so much time and efforts for Germans, notably in Greece, that its downfall caused the anger of Hitler and made it a priority to control Italy and restore the fascist regime of Mussolini (from that point, a German puppet). Despite all the resistant movements, Italy's loss wasn't just economical, but also symbolical, and what strikes in Roberto Rosselini's film is how lucid Italian people are, it's silent anger that fuel their force with vital energy. That anger wouldn't be as silent one when they'll get a hand on the ex-Duce, and I guess his fate showed how much resentment they had to vent.Nonetheless, people's anger has never be so dignified in a film without it being unrealistic, you really feel it in the general mood, even in people's way to express resignation. And the reason why this is so perceptible in the film is because Rosselini shot it shortly after the end of the war, among real ruins, and the screenplay was written while the German presence was still a fact. It's a film shot with an urge to be made and brought up at time as if Rosselini and all the actors knew they were participating to an important project, one that would show to the face of the world, that Italian were as much victims as any other countries and were not allies of the Nazi, the real Italian heart beat in the Roman streets not in a parliament.Ultimately, the film didn't end up being a powerful tribute to the sense of sacrifice and the fortitude of Italian people, it's also a magnificent and powerful tribute to all the people, in all the countries in the world that resisted the German invasion or any other invasion. The film holds a similar significance than other contemporary movies' scenes like Chaplin's final speech in \"The Great Dictator\" or the Marseillaise in \"Casablanca\". Except that it was made in more restrictive conditions. So, don't take its uneven quality, the different level of brightness and lighting as some effects to provide documentary-like realism or some artistic license. The film was made in secrecy and urgency as if it was part of a resistance movement itself.But Cinema is a world of imagery, and the film had one to offer, one that forever captures the tragedy of war and the wounds it inflicted to people. The image of Anna Magnani running, arms raised, to the truck, that is taking her soon-to-be husband, only to be shot dead by the Nazis, under the eyes of her son. It was Scorsese's \"Voyage to Italy\" that prepared me to this scene, one of those that impacted him the most, and for some reason, I thought it was the end of the film, as the one emotional highlight the film could have. The death of a pregnant woman, a strong mother, a future wife, whose beliefs was shaken by war's reality, was a powerful allegory of a country carrying bright hopes only to see its dreams annihilated by a barbaric force. Anna Magnani didn't play an Italian, she was Italy.And the supporting cast is a microcosm of the best and the 'worst' that war can bring, an actively resistant priest played by Aldo Fabrini and a communist (Marcello Pagliero), there is also an interestingly flawed character in Marina (Maria Michi), a cabaret dancer who prostituted herself by selling information to a female informant agent and lover, to afford some fancy lifestyle, convincing herself that she never really hurt anyone. In a way, she embodies the attitude of Mussoloni when he sold Italians' soul to the German, in the firm belief that it was the right horse to bet\u0085 until Hitler, wrapped up in his megalomania decided to invade USSR. And the way, Marina Is finally treated at the end, echoed the way Italy was left and the disgraceful punishment that awaited the Duce and his followers. \"Rome, Open City\" is about people who incarnate the Italian spirit, oscillating between two poles, the true Italian like Anna Magnani and the wounded and weakened Italy (closer to Marina) People are torn between their patriotism, their belief in humanity and in barbarity, but all in all, only humanity can triumph, and it even inspires a Nazi officer to confront Captain Hartmann, the sadistic antagonist of the film played by Dutch actor Joop van Hulzen. He wonders why Germans dare to call themselves the Master Race, which race of lords can torture people to death, execute priests or mothers. Despite Van Hulzen's slightly over-the-top performance, you could feel that Rosselini didn't want to portray the Germans as a one-dimensional evil group either, and that foresees his future \"Germany Year Zero\" where he'd shine a light on the other forgotten victims of World War II: the German people. But while this film relied too much on amateur actors, \"Rome Open City\" is a cinematic triumph because only performances from true actors could communicate the right emotions and would have the right impact on the world.Rosselini's casting choices proved him right, and \"Rome, Open City\" is a masterful melodrama, a historical document and a great tribute to anonymous heroes who wrote the most glorious lines of Italian history.",

Films like The Bicycle Thieves and LaStrada stand out as milestones of Italian cinema. This film, however, is the dramatic zenith of that time period; made in 1945, when every event in this film was more than likely to have happened exactly (or worse) than it was portrayed. The performances are superb, and the direction is impeccable. This is a WW2 film from the view of Italians; and it should not be missed to try and understand why Italy had such a difficult time transitioning from WW2 to its modern day status. The country was torn between heartfelt socialism/communism (as portrayed in the film) and pure capitalism (which eventually won out). Now, a more socially acceptable form of Socialism and Capitalism have come closer to the center of the political spectrum in Italy, allowing it to move forward as one the top dozen or so countries in the world of commerce. Great film, and not to be missed.",

Rome, Open City was made at the right time. One has to look at the fact that it was made in 1945 when World War 2 ended and so the relatable graphs of this films goes too high. Something similar i related to Charlie Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator' which was made in 1940 and the centre subject of the film was Hitler. That's why these films are called gutsy, daring and sensational, i mean apart from filmmaking aspects these things adds extra in the final impact. During the Nazi occupation of Rome in 1944, the Resistance leader, Giorgio Manfredi, is chased by the Nazis as he seeks refuge and a way to escape. This film tries the best to stay real instead of becoming filmy or dramatic. Even those last 2 scenes are shot realistically while any other filmmaker would have made it more of a cinematic experience than a neorealism picture. Maybe that's why it looks slightly rough in the first half because that part goes mostly in introduction scenes of characters and conversations between them. In the second half it turns into real film as we see things moving rapidly and finally resulting into something. Here, that love angle or that Dame factor was bit boring because it was outdated but rest of the time it didn't lose the grip nor an engagement. All the actors look damn real in their roles as everyone attempts give their natural best. Aldo Fabrizi and Anna Magnani are my top 2 performers here. This film is a big achievement for Roberto Rossellini who showed the realistic sense and hardcore patriotism in the film and certainly set benchmarks for other war films. Overall, a hard-hitting communist classic which I think must mean something to all Italian audience.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",

The bulk of the film is devoted to the lives of those involved and revolves much around the ducking and weaving necessitated by the presence of the nazis. The last 30 minutes though is a hard and unpleasant watch and does not lead to a happy ending so be warned. The performances are outstanding particularly Anna Magnani and Aldo Fabrizi who steals the whole film.The only very slight note of criticism is in the characters of the Gestapo, who all seem a bit over the top and out of central casting with the lead baddie more like something out of a Bond film.

            "content": "Rome after the Second World War was a damaged, destroyed city. The huge film industry that had once been known all over Europe was, quite literally, in ruins.Hence, when Roberto Rossellini took up his camera in 1945 to start shooting 'Open City', he was forced to make due with quite a few limitations: using scavenged film stock, whatever kind he could get his hands on; shooting outside and on location; and employing a much more dynamic, though much less controlled, form of cinematography than Italian cinema had previously seen. The result was an unpolished, rough gem of a film that, in addition to its many contributions to the evolution of cinema, left the pre-war Italian super-spectacle in the dust.In terms of story, 'Open City' is pure melodrama; and a pretty, darn affecting one at that. Thematically, it's socialist, a reaction against the fascism, personified by Mussolini, that had just been defeated in Italy. But, it is in its style that the film truly stands out.With 'Open City', Rossellini succeeded in taking adverse conditions and using them to craft a solid, emotional tale of the Italian resistance. In the process, he solidified the aesthetic of an entire film movement: Italian Neorealism.The film is recommended to anyone who enjoys a good story, is interesting as an artifact of its historical period, and is absolutely indispensable to anyone with at least a passing interest in the history of cinema.",

For the 1940s it was also pretty explicit--there's a German lesbian character, tortures, bombings and a woman (a main character) is shot down in cold blood (that was never done back then). It was shot in documentary style which makes it seem more realistic. The only debits were the bad music and a German official who acts like he came out of a Hollywood movie about Germans.

            "content": "Open CityThe Neo-Realistic film Open City relives the tragic suffering of Italy and the people's resistance to Nazi occupation during World War II.  The story depicts how a liberation group tries to conceal its leader, Giorgio Manfredi.  The role each plays in the resistance reveals an intimate portrayal of their lives.  Whether for religion, love, rebellion, greed, or nationalism these rebels attempt to make sense of war and cope with their problems. The omniscient point of view provides an understanding of each character's motivation to survive their dreadful situation. The director, Rossellini, made Open City an attempt to \"restore the nationalism from the chaos\" left by the war.  In order to restore the nationalism for his audience, Rossellini reconciled the characters' differences through their common motivation for better lives.Brecht said, in referring to Neo-Realism, \"it doesn't show real things, its shows how things really are.\"  I feel that despite the low budget and quality of stock, Rossellini made an excellent film full of real life images. The strength of the screenplay, through its poignant representation of the wartime struggle, made Open City an outstanding film.  Rossellini properly explained the human condition in a way that Italians and all viewers could empathize.  However, I am not convinced the film's message came across correctly, as a nationalistic film.  In the documentary, Neo-Realism, a gentleman thought it depicted Italians poorly.  This contradicts the entire message of the film.ContentThe screenplay by Sergio Amidei and Federico Fellini powerfully captures the importance of the characters' personalities set in this wartime struggle for survival. The motivation of Pina and Francesco is love.  They enjoy a love for their country, their son, and their lives.  Especially poignant was the scene in which they sat in the stairwell and remembered the good times and hoped for better.  Pina's sister, Marina is motivated by greed.  She has had many lovers and even sold her friends for her materialistic needs. She finally sees the effect of her horrible deeds; but then it is too late when Manfredi is dead.  Giorgio Manfredi is motivated by his nationalism for Italy and loyalty to the liberation movement.  His patriotism and loyalty to friends are idealized in the imprisonment and a torture scene where he refuses to talk and is at peace with his fate as a martyr.  Don Pietro Pellegrini is motivated by faith.  Don Pietro believes that God's Will has brought the war.  He believes prayer and forgiveness are the answers to suffering.  Nevertheless he is also a practical man.  As a forger he shows he can contribute more than prayer to the struggle.  His compromise as a religious figure suggests that there are no black and white lines separating roles and ideals of the independence movement.Marcello, Pina's son, is motivated by rebellion and group behavior. Marcello, although young and immature, is an excellent representation of the citizens who organized and rebelled against the Nazis.  The point is made that even at his age he could play a role in the war.  Marcello therefore symbolizes the significance of the most insignificant person and the struggle of all Rome.  Also, as a youthful figure he also symbolizes the future of Rome and Italy.  In the final scene he and his friend console each other as they march back to the city.  This suggests that Italians must comfort each other and rebuild after the war.FormThe film's low budget is evident through its various technical flaws.  The film stock was a poor quality and originated from different reels.  In splitting the stock there lacks a consistent flow to the film.  There are points in the film where sound is completely eliminated and others where camera angles are suddenly adjusted, as if they were editing over a previous scene (editor-Eraldo Da Roma).  A lack of continuity is seen in the scene where a car is filmed approaching a building.  When the car stops, the film seems make a quick edit and then switches to a new camera angle as people leave the car.  Another flaw is the poor quality of lighting in the film. In an effort to put certain emphasis on a person or object, light floods some areas.  This makes it impossible to view it without difficulty. Additionally too much light is given when a \"medium shot\" is given to characters as they sit giving a monologue.  Ingrid, the Nazi's girlfriend, often receives too much light when she speaks.  Perhaps it is her pale skin or the cinematographer's desire to emphasize the face resulting in overexposure (cinematographer-Ubaldo Arata). This distracts from the movement and speech of the actress. Finally, the colors of the apartment walls are too bright.  As characters move throughout the hallways and stairways, the bright light background reduces their depth and texture.",

It is certainly more interesting and better-made than his film Paisan, which I felt was too choppy and had too many lulls, though it never really rises to the level of great films such as Two Women (De Sica) or General della Rovere (also Rossellini). I think a little of the reason these latter two films work better is that they were not hurried into production (Open City came out in 1945) and just seemed more polished and captivating. In addition, the movie, though very interesting and important historically, was a bit sloppy in its depiction of the Nazis. One officer was continually shown wearing a tunic that was sloppy (with the top button open) and he sported a very Italian-looking mustache.

            "content": "It is hard to overestimate the influence of \"Rome, open city\" on the history of film.There is much debate if \"Rome open city\" is the first neo realist movie. Some are of the opinion that already \"Ossessione\" (1943, Luchino Visconti) complied with the characteristics of this movement, although one can also classify this movie (based on a novel by James M. Cain) as film noir. There is however little discussion about the fact that \"Rome, open city\" was the breakthrough of neo realism.Prepared during war time, shot while the Second World War was still raging in parts of Italy this film bears all characteristics that would become the trade marks of neo realism: shot on location, mostly non professional actors and a real life story adjacant to a documentary. Unlike the Danish \"dogma\" movement decades later these choices were not entirely made out of free will, but largely inspired by the lack of infrastructure after the Second World War. \"Rome, open city\" is for example shot with film stock that is definitely second rate. This is of course not a trademark of neo realism, there simply was no film stock of better quality available.Most of the actors were non professional, but there were a few exceptions. Anna Magnani was one of the exceptions and after \"Rome, open city\" she went on to become a big star that worked with great Italian directors like Fellini, Visconti and Pasolini. In \"Rome, open city\" she dies halfway, but her dying scene is realy heartbreaking. A few years later she would shine as a mother who would do anything to make her daughter a moviestar in \"Bellissima\" (1951, Luchino Visconti).Anna Magnani is by far the most well known actress from \"Rome, open city\", but I would like to also call attention to some of the other actors.Maria Michi is a beautiful girl working in a cabaret who is addicted to drugs (and luxuries) and so becomes dependend on the Nazi's. After \"Rome, open city\" Michi would also play in Rossellini's \"Paisa\" (1946) but after that her career came to a halt.Even less impressive is the career of Harry Feist, who plays the evil German. In fact \"Rome, open city\" would remain his only film of importance. Remarkable to me was his physical likeness with Donald Sutherland in \"Novecento\" (1976, Bernardo Bertolucci), who also plays a Second World War villian in that movie.After \"Rome, open city\", which is situated in occupied Italy, Rossellini made two other war movies. \"Paisa\" (1946) is about the liberation of Italy by the Americans, \"Germania anno zero\" (1948) is about Germany after the war.\"Rome, open city\" is famous as the breakthrough of both neo realism and Anna Magnani, and rightly so. It is however not the best neo realist movie (nor the best movie of Anna Magnani, of whom I like the aformentioned \"Bellissima\" more). The film has some flaws, and these are not all attributable to the difficult circumstances under which it was produced. The monologue of the disillusioned German Captain Hartmann, openly criticizing the \"Third Reich\" with other German officers present, does not seem very realistic to me.As a director Roberto Rossellini thus had his limitations. My favourite neo realist director was and remains Vittorio de Sica, with masterpieces such as \"Bycicle thieves\" (1948) and \"Umberto D\" (1952).",

No matter how noxious Mussolini was, his machinations could never equal the sheer terror machine which was Nazi Germany, and the Italians, under the yoke of Nazi oppression, became victims soon after Hitler's troops marched into Rome and began terrorizing the populace.Rossellini's main protagonist is Giorgio Manfedi (Marcello Pagliero), an engineer and Communist resistance leader, who we later learn did 12 years hard time as an anti-Fascist agitator. After escaping the Nazis by fleeing from a rooming house and climbing over rooftops, Giorgio makes his way to the apartment of fellow Resistance fighter, Francesco. Not home yet, he ends up speaking with his next-door neighbor, Pina, Francesco's pregnant fianc\u00e9e (played by the iconic Anna Magnani, whose performance as Pina made her a star).We're next introduced to Don Pietro, a Catholic priest sympathetic to the Resistance, who is scheduled to officiate at Pina and Francesco's wedding the next day. In Rossellini's world view, Don Pietro and Giorgio are not incompatible despite past conflicts between Communists and a right-leaning Catholic church. The Nazi terror bonds them together and indeed Don Pietro is more than willing to help Giorgio by taking money and information to Resistance leaders outside the city. As a priest, he is permitted to roam about during the curfew.The collaborators are represented by two women: Pina's sister, Laura, and Marina, Giorgio former girlfriend, who both work at the same cabaret, and receive financial support by prostituting themselves to German officers. The fact that Giorgio never suspects that Marina is a collaborator is perhaps one of the most glaring weaknesses of the script.Rossellini did a wonderful job casting a dance hall entertainer, Harry Fiest, to play the SS commander in the City, Major Bergmann. Some have complained that Bergmann appears effeminate and it's been argued that homosexuality was often linked to the perverse evil of the Nazis in films of the time. In reality, Hitler and many of his minions, may have actually been homosexuals (see the book \"The Hidden Hitler\" by Lothar Machtan) but the association of Nazism and homosexuality should not cause those in our own time to conclude there is an underlying pathology to being gay (in fact, the Nazis of course persecuted homosexuals but of those Nazis who were homosexual, it's been posited that they didn't see themselves as \"gay\"\u2014their wrath was reserved for homosexuals of a more liberal or left-wing persuasion).Bergmann is aided by another collaborator, the Italian Fascist police chief, and with his help, a raid is ordered at Francesco's apartment. Giorgio escapes but Francesco is rounded up and in a shocking, brilliant scene, Pina is gunned down as she runs toward Francesco, who is being taken away in a truck full of prisoners. Francesco fortunately escapes after resistance fighters ambush the truck and free its captives.Not all the Germans are seen as evil\u2014an Austrian defector comes to Don Pietro seeking help but he's eventually arrested by the Gestapo along with Giorgio and Don Pietro after Marina betrays them for drugs and a fur coat (Bergmann's assistant is Ingrid, an apparent lesbian, who is involved with Marina, and convinces her to give up Giorgio.) Francesco manages to avoid arrest when he tarries for a minute longer saying goodbye to Pina's young son, Marcello.Rossellini creates an odd set where Bergmann's headquarters is in a room sandwiched in between a torture chamber and bar for the officers. Bergmann is more than a one-dimensional character\u2014he's nuanced enough to recognize that if he fails to gets his prisoners to talk, they'll be considered on the same level of his fellow Nazis, who he presumes will never break under torture\u2014thus negating the theory of the master race. Another great touch is when Captain Hartmann, Bergmann's underling, blurts out that all the Nazis know is \"killing, killing, killing,\" while he's intoxicated\u2014but the next day, while sober, ends up executing Don Pietro with glee!Giorgio is the first to undergo torture, and Rossellini makes it even more horrifying when Bergmann opens the door to the torture chamber and allows the audience glimpses of what's going on. He brings Don Pietro in (since he can't see clearly after breaking his glasses earlier on) and gazes at a Christ-like Giorgio, then realizing his fellow resistance leader is dead. In a brilliant scene, the often self-sacrificing priest suddenly loses his cool and curses out Bergmann and his group including Marina, who faints at the sight of her deceased former boyfriend. Don Pietro is of course only human and we come to realize that sometimes religion is a mask for repressed rage. The denouement involves the execution of Don Pietro up on a hillside\u2014witnessed by boys from his parish. Notably, the Italian soldiers intentionally fire and miss at the doomed priest, tied up to a chair\u2014and the aforementioned Captain Hartmann delivers the coup de grace.The brilliance of Rossellini's vision lies in his lack of sentiment\u2014the tragedy of lives lost at the hands of monsters is never soft-pedaled. Rome, Open City is a classic due to its powerful script and indelible images.",

            "content": "Set in Rome in 1944 during the Nazi occupation, it began to be filmed in early 1945, immediately after the city was liberated by the Americans, but while much of Italy was still under Nazi control. It tells the story of several Italian Resistance members, a priest based on an actual priest, some collaborators, and local SS officers trying to gain information about the Resistance.Giorgio is a Communist member of the Resistance who escapes capture by the Germans. He meets Francesco and Pina, a couple who plan to be married the next day. She is a widow with a young son, Marcello. They contact Don Pietro Pellegrini, a priest who is also assisting the Resistance.After a raid by SS troops, Francesco is captured. Pina runs after him but is shot dead in one of the film's iconic scenes. Giorgio escapes, as does Francesco later, with the help of the Resistance. Giorgio's former girlfriend, Marina, betrays him to the SS. Giorgio and Don Pietro are captured by the SS, but Francesco gets away by happenstance.SS Major Bergmann directs Giorgio's torture, which Don Pietro is forced to observe. As this film is the beginning of Italian neo-realism, the film ends as you might expect.This was the first of Rossellini's War Trilogy, filmed immediately after World War II. The realism included filming on location, not in a studio, and the use of many non-professional actors except for Aldo Fabrizi and Anna Magnani.\"Rome Open City\" is historically fascinating and remarkable for the context within which it was filmed. It was initially ignored by Italians who were war-weary, but soon it gained success in France and North America. In time it became iconic in Italy.",

            "content": "\"Roma Citt\u00e0 Aperta\" is between the most important movies in the history of Italian cinema. It is not only one of the initiators and masterpieces of Italian neorealism, but also a beautiful story of courage, rebellion against blind evil and faith. I can't really relate to the faith part, as my ideas are much different from those spread by Don Pietro, but the -let's say- secular part moved me much more than I thought it would, especially the iconic race where Pina tries to get her husband back from the Nazis. She is so frantic and desperate in pursuing the impossible goal of running away from all that darkness, a small tear piled up in my eyes. Even the Nazis are not depicted in such a black-or-white manner, seeing a couple of them actually realizing, as their colleagues threaten, beat and murder, that they belong to no higher race after all. The only flaw is at the end, where actual facts are changed so that it appears that the Nazi general pulled the trigger on the priest, while it was not so (the Italian government imposed to the production to present it this way to prevent possible agitations). So I'd say that Sergio Amidei's script is a truly heartbreaking, thought-provoking piece that deserves its fame in Italy and elsewhere. Rossellini is a great director, he technically invented (alongside maybe Luchino Visconti) Italian neorealism with this film, but knowing that he actually directed movies for the fascist regime beforehand doesn't let me love his hand behind the camera when he shoots a story against the Axis. Acting. Anna Magnani and Aldo Fabrizi easily steal the show, actually they take it by right, as their characters existed in real life (more or less, as in any work of fiction) and their duty was to make their memory last forever: they did, beautifully.",

            "content": "This Italian film is one I found in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it was rated highly by critics also, so I hoped it would be something I'd like, directed by Roberto Rossellini (Paisan, Europe '51, Journey to Italy). Basically, set in 1944, in Italy during the Nazi occupation, Rome is declared an open city, most Romans are free to wander the streets without fearing the city being bombed or being killed in the process. But with the Nazi occupation life remains difficult for the Romans, with a curfew, rationing of basic foods, and the Nazis searching for the resistance, those working for and assisting them, to quash them. Pina (Anna Magnani) is a widowed mother worn down by the war, she is due to get married to next door neighbour, typist Francesco (Francesco Grandjacquet), they will marry by Catholic priest Don Pietro Pellegrini (Aldo Fabrizi), despite her being pregnant and him being an atheist. The day before the wedding, Francesco's friend Giorgio Manfredi, aka Luigi Ferraris (Marcello Pagliero), who Pina has never met, is looking for Francesco and needs a place to hide, he is a member of the resistance. Giorgio also requests the assistance of Don Pietro for his latest mission, the priest is more than willing as he believes he is doing it for God, his position also gives Giorgio access to places others cannot enter. Marina Mari (Maria Michi), a cabaret performer, is Giorgio's girlfriend and has no idea where he is hiding, both she and Pina take measures to improve their lives under the difficult circumstances, these combined actions have tragic consequences by the end. Also starring Harry Feist as Major Bergmann, Giovanna Galletti as Ingrid and Vito Annichiarico as Piccolo Marcello, son of Pina. The story is based on actual events from the last days of the Nazi occupation, it is mostly a montage structure full of primarily non-professional actors, and the visual style adds to the feel of melodrama, I will admit that it being in a foreign language and having to read subtitles made it tricky to keep up with, but overall it is a worthwhile enough neorealist wartime drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay. Good, in my opinion!",

This movie is largely a humanistic heroic statement, but its focus is on the utter importance of life... life that is free and unabused.The setting is Nazi-occupied Rome, the characters, a bunch of Roman citizens who live day by day under the shadow of the Reich. Key to the action is a priest who practices civil disobedience; his friend, a revolutionary; and a pregnant woman who plans to marry the revolutionary. They all try to figure out what's important to them while the Gustapos search for any signs of rebellion, thus putting pressure on their day to day life.The real mix that helps make this film really empathetic is its focus on heroic inner strength, which can seem to make matters of real life seem lesser, for the purpose of maintaining free and unconflicted life, which it illustrates as most important. Thus the mere act of living is the goal, and the martyr of a hero so others can live the romance. It's quite beautiful really.It also adds bits of light humor amidst moments of tragedy in a rather grateful way, thus keeping it from being just cynical and depressing. Overall, it really does take the time to care for the simple natures of noteworthy characters.--PolarisDiB",

Finally, Harry Feist, who plays the chief antagonist Major Bergmann, sporting a mechanical Italian accent with a distinctive emphasis on every single syllable and exaggerating his unabashed swagger and hubris (that Master race and Slave race remark is abominably grating), comes off as a curate's egg, one-note maybe, but also superbly watchable nonetheless.While Rossellini surveys meticulously for exterior locations that maintain high fidelity of Rome's immediate state under the occupation, he also makes good with available if limited means to establish striking indoor settings, in particular the tripartite space of Bergmann's office where the interrogation takes place, one end of the office room is connected to the spare, hellish torture chamber, and another to a saloon proffered with booze and tuneage where German officers revel in their dooming fantasy and superiority, by transiting from one place to another, Rossellini hits the bull's eye of making his point, ROME, OPEN CITY is unapologetically dichotomous in its moral stance, and aesthetically, arresting from A to Z.",

            "content": "Rome, open city is one of the most popular and most important Italian neorealism films.Italian neorealism films were popularised after the fall of Benito Mussolini's government. In the 1930's Mussolini started to use film, not only to show fascist propaganda but as a cultural institution. After he realised this he founded the Venice film festival 1932, in 1935 he founded a film school and in 1937 he founded cinecitta studios. This is significant to the fall of the fascist Italian government in 1943 because many of the neo-realist directors started as film critics. Many film critics that ended up as directors wrote for a magazine called cinema, cinema was run by Benito Mussolini's son Vittorio who was actually a film producer. Vittorio made writing about politics forbidden in the magazine so instead of writing about politics the critics, instead of writing about politics the critics denounced telefoni bianchi movies. Telefoni bianchi films were pretty much the only film to come out of Italy at this time, they were so heavily criticized as they all showed extreme wealth, something the general public could not even imagine, and fascist regimes. This brings me to what I've been getting at this whole review. Neo-realist films don't show extreme wealth but quite the opposite, it shows the bleakness and sadness of working glass Italy in, starting in 1943. However these films were regarded as disgusting and unholy until the end of the German occupation in 1945 and the fall of Mussolini's government in 1943, the filmmakers were finally able to tell their stories without interference. The reason I mention all this is because this is a hugely important time for cinema, these are some of the most important, influential films ever made and Rome, open city is one of the most important Italian neorealism films ever made. You get the idea, this is one of the most significant movies ever made.It tells the story of life in Rome under German occupation in 1945, the film was released after occupation was over but filming began as the German's still occupied the city and I can't help but admire that, it shows passion that not many filmmakers have. It captures the feeling of living under these circumstances absolutely wonderfully and by capturing the feeling so well it is horrific. I can't imagine living like that, living in constant fear, it's ridiculous the pain that innocent people were put through so the nazi's got information of someone they might met one time in their lives.The technical elements are mostly fantastic. My main quarry is the editing, during every conversation I felt the cut came just a bit too early, each time there was a cut there was about a fifth of a second where nobody said anything and it bagan to annoy me after it kept happening. My favourite technical element was the cinematography but I also want to mention the ADR, it is brilliant, most of the time it doesn't even looked like it is dubbed, even if you look at something like the good the bad and the ugly which came out 21 years after this the ADR is dreadful and extremely distracting. This is another example of the extra effort and passion that went into making this movie.I watched Rome, open city and a woman under the influence today. If you have seen these movies you'll know I should probably take a break from heavy, emotional movies. But I'm not going to. Watch this movie if you haven't already it is a must see.",

The movie is quite grim & it is needless to say that it has a realist feel to it, which makes one feel that they are a part of the experience. What I really liked about the film was that even in the middle of all the bleakness, Rosselini managed to add a few light moments which made the characters seem more human. He even managed to make me empathize with a religious figure, which is nothing short of a miracle! Some scenes such as the shooting of Pina and the torture scenes actually managed to affect me. The scene at the end also has a quiet beauty as we witness young boys showing solidarity to the preacher. Afterwards, the boys head home to pick up the pieces of their lives just like Rome was doing in those days. I may be nitpicking here but I was confused about the relationship between Marina & Giorgio. Why was Giorgio even involved with someone like her? And if he was genuinely interested in her, why did he suddenly abandon her? Could he also be trying to get information out of her just as the Nazis were? I wish the film had provided some closure on this issue. But minor grievances aside, watching this film was a rewarding experience. Highly recommended!",

            "content": "Ah, post war Italian cinema in its infancy. Filmed immediately after the end of the war and using German POWs as extras, the movie shows the scars Italy bore at the time. Filmed on the streets around Rome and with a partially amateur cast, the movie has a strong sense of reality that defined Italian movies for several years. It's so easy to see the poverty that was present in Italy before the rise of fascism, the broken promises of fascism's rise, and the destruction of the war that fascism wrought.The movie has a reputation that its more of a document of life in Italy in the later years of the war than a story, so I was surprised at how strong the story actually is. In fact, the original distributor refused to release the movie because it was more document than fiction. At least two characters were based on real people, and the ending, which is filled with torture and executions, is far from a fun time at the movies, but damn is the movie great.The story itself revolves around three people, Pina, a pregnant widow ready to marry an underground printer, Giorgio, an underground engineer on the run from the Gestapo, and Don Pietro, a local priest who is using his status as a shield from the Nazis and fascists to aid the local underground.As a portrait of life in the underground, the movie is utterly convincing. It's not just the production design (which really does feel like they filmed around Rome and nothing more), but the performances from the actors and non-actors alike. There's a despair that's evident in every Italian on screen for everyone, even the children, had just lived through several years of privation and war. The story reinforces all of that.Pina is a woman trying to make a normal life in the face of all of this awfulness. She found love again after the death of her husband. She's pregnant with her new man's baby, and the new man has also taken a shine to her first child, but it cannot be and tragedy strikes. Giorgio tries to distance himself from emotional connection, wanting to focus on the work of insurrection, and his young lover, who has used her beauty as a way to gain rich lovers over the war and create a comfortable life, turns on him. Don Pietro hates the oppression of the fascists and will help anyone. He delivers counterfeit lira to the underground from the printer, protects underground men and boys from capture, and tries to organize escapes.Pina gets shot down in the streets. Giorgio and Don Pietro are captured, and Don Pietro must watch the SS torture Giorgio as the German in charge begs him to convince Giorgio to cooperate. When Giorgio dies, Don Pietro has a moment of rage as he calls for God to smite the Germans, which he instantly begs forgiveness for. He's then taken out and shot in the back of the head in front of a group of children.The movie's a downer, for sure, but with an implicit ray of hope. The movie was made by Italians after the fall of Nazism and fascism, so the deaths of those on screen aren't felt as hopeless tragedies, but necessary steps towards Italy's freedom from oppression. It's a marvelous mix of sad and hope.",

            "content": "This is a thoughtful and brooding drama about freedom fighters\nthat go wrong and set in the Nazi occupied-Rome location. An intelligent and sensitive Rosselini account of italian underground movement during the nazi occupation of Rome . As Rome is classified an open city , most Romans can wander the streets without fear of the city being bombed or them being killed in the process . A resistance leader , Giorgio Manfredi (Marcello Pagliero) , is pursued by the Nazis as he seeks refuge and a way to escape. As he takes shelter at home of a war-worn widowed mother called Pina (Anna Magnani) , she is about to get married to her next-door neighbor Francesco (Francesco Grandjacquet). Despite Pina being pregnant and Francesco being an atheist , they'll be married by Catholic priest Don Pietro Pelligrini (based on an actual character splendidly performed Aldo Fabrizi) . But life for Romans is still difficult with the Nazi occupation as there is a curfew, starvation , black market , smuggling and basic foods are rationed to order to avoid famine , and while the Nazis are still searching for those working for the resistance . Rossellini's Great Film of Our Time !Compelling study about resistance and survival in WWII Italy was the essential movie to come out of postwar Europe and has been deemed a classic in Italian Neorealism by using actual outdoors , real roles for added realistic effect and even true German POWs as extras . The picture evolved from a documentary about a priest serving in the Resistence , which perhaps accounts for its refusal to entertain or compromise conventional notions of heroism . Co-scripted by a young Federico Fellini , Sergio Amidei and director Roberto Rosselini himself , this engaging tale traces the threads of people's lives as they interact and eventually entangle and doom themselves in the shadow of their Gestapo-controlled Open City . Rosselini's best movie was shot under extremely difficult circumstances and real hardship at the end of WWII .This interesting and powerful moviemaking gem was compellingly directed by Roberto Rosselini who started began filming the movie two months after the Nazis left Rome in June 1944. Roberto Rossellini worked with a good script written by notorious writers , but also using a handful of personal notes. His training in cinema was thorough and extensive and he became expert in many facets of film-making. And his brother Renzo Rossellini, also was involved in the industry , scoring films . Roberto did his apprenticeship as an assistant to Italian filmmakers , then got the chance to make his first film, a documentary, \"Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune\", in 1937. Due to his close ties to Benito Mussolini's second son, the critic and film producer Vittorio Mussolini, he flourished in fascist Italy's cinema. Once Il Duce was deposed, Rossellini Rossellini produced this his first classic film, the anti-fascist Roma, ciudad abierta (1945) (\"Rome, Open City\") in 1945, which won the Grand Prize at Cannes. Two other neo-realist classics soon followed, Pais\u00e0 (1946) (\"Paisan\") and Alemania, a\u00f1o cero (1948) (\"Germany in the Year Zero\"). In \"Rome, Open City\" screenwriters Sergio Amidei and Federico Fellini were nominated for a Best Writing, Screenplay Oscar in 1947, while Rossellini himself, along with Amidei, Fellini and two others were nominated for a screen-writing Oscar in 1950 for \"Paisan\". Rating : 8/10 . Better than average. Fundamental and indispensable watching for Italian classics fans.",

It's an odd film, forcing together elements of striking contrast: farcical humour and grisly torture, sordid realism and surreal decadence. The story follows the pursuit and torture of an Italian resistance leader in Rome at the tail end of the war. This character is the usual deadpan earnest resistance leader in the manner of Victor Laszlo in \"Casablanca\" (a pity they couldn't avoid the stereotype). He is assisted by a bumbling priest (Aldo Fabrizi) who for much of the film is a gently comic figure, and Anna Magnani, pregnant fianc\u00e9e of another resistance hero from the tenements. The two leads give fine performances. There's plenty of realism: kids getting clipped round the ear, a couple climbing into bed together, a toddler on a potty \u0096 humanely done and very interesting - but the best scenes in the film involve a glamorous semi-prostitute (a Veronica Lake look-alike) who is tempted into betrayal and ends up in the arms of a lesbian matahari in Gestapo HQ. The bizarre and effete goings-on here are remarkable \u0096 the brutal SS chief is camp in the extreme, and one SS officer gets drunk and voices cynicism and disgust at what they are doing \u0096 a welcome break from the relentless Nazi stereotype \u0096 it's never possible to believe that all Nazis were... well, Nazis. The torture scenes are really what it's all about though and are both perpetrated and endured with a disturbing frankness. It all makes Melville's \"Armee des Ombres\" seem like a comic strip. One F. Fellini co-wrote the screenplay and indeed won his first Oscar for it. Surely this is not, as often claimed, the first true neo-realist film \u0096 Visconti's \"Ossessione\" came several years earlier and is more consistent in style \u0096 but this is good stuff, however you look at it.",

An incredible scene of hungry people from the city waiting in line at a bakery for a loaf of bread. Young boys joining in the battle against the Germans.  There is a hidden tension through the film of whether the Father and the underground leaders would be arrested because of betrayal from citizens working with the Germany military.

            "content": "After WWII filmmakers tried to find their ways to deal with history. A British director Humphrey Jennings made evocative documentaries about WWII and Americans made more romantic features about the war from their perspective. Here Italy comes in. The nation which had just got away from the chains of fascist management. Today this postwar Italian movement is known as neorealism, which is recognized from its reportage-like characterization, national personal gallery and dramatization of the resistance. But it cannot only be described by these external aesthetic features. The starting points in Italian neorealism were in the anti-fascist battle and the Italian liberalization.The people who formed neorealism, Vittorio De Sica, Luchino Visconti, Roberto Rosselini and many others, wanted to bring Italy back to the midst of other nations. They wanted to find their own way of dealing with the history. Narratively the way was the documentary, reportage-like characterization. The shady cinematography combined with the daring description of Italians. Even today Open City is praised as the symbol of the resistance and the picture of the character played by Anna Magnani was actually published in a stamp after 50 years in Italy. Her character became the symbol of the resistance.Film historians often tend to argue, who actually started neorealism. In 1943 Luchino Visconti directed Ossessione, which at least aesthetically looks like the work of a neorealist. Which probably is true, but neorealism is seen as a postwar genre and since the WWII ended in 1945, the statement that Ossessione would've began the movement is weak. But it most certainly did give it a start and the ingredients. Some also state that De Sica's Bicycle Thieves (1948) is the greatest film of neorealism. I think that Bicycle Thieves is a masterpiece, but when defining what neorealism actually is Rosselini's reportage-like characterization works better than De Sica's lyricism. Open City is the first film, which finely defined neorealism.Open City is perhaps the most personal film by Rosselini. It was written under the watchful eyes of the fascist management, where the risk of getting arrested was always near. This made Rosselini and the other screenwriter Sergio Amidei feel like they were a part of the resistance - what would be greater than to write your own page to history? When young Federico Fellini (today the most famous of the team) joined the crew, they started to film it with an incredibly low budget. Roberto Rosselini has said: \"Open City achieved more than all the efforts of the Italian Foreign Ministry put together. It helped Italy to find its own place among other nations.\" Rome Open City is a picture of its own time, it's a landmark in the history of cinema. In both the WWII genre and in Italian neorealism, which influenced the Japanese postwar cinema (Kurosawa, Ichikawa) and the Nouvelle Vague - French New Wave (Godard, Truffaut, Rivette, Chabrol & Rohmer). It's a cry for democracy and freedom. It is a hopeful picture of Italy free from the chains of the fascists. It meant a totally new way of dealing with the history. Open City was a very ambitious film, but it succeed in all of its intentions. It is still a timeless masterpiece.",

Finally, federovsky (\"Great film, however you classify it\", federovsky from bangkok, 30 April 2008) has an excellent review.***\"Rome, Open City (1945, Roberto Rossellini\ufeff)\", a return to Nazi- occupied Italy\ufeff, is potent. While not the first example of Italian Neorealism, it is usually described as the one that inspired the rest. \"Open City\" has some flaws, but it is so brutal and stark that you likely will leave the theater stunned. Rossellini deserves credit for completing it. It was filmed on a shoestring budget as the Nazis began to leave Rome, ending their military occupation. (Rossellini used scraps of film left behind by the retreating German forces.) A mixture of experienced and novice actors are used. It is perhaps not a trivial detail to mention that one of the contributors to the writing, and the uncredited Second Unit director was a young Federico Fellini\ufeff.The story revolves around the pursuit of a resistance hero (portrayed by Marcello Pagliero) by the Fascists. The Nazis are very ruthless here. Eventually, there are several torture scenes which don't show much of the painful details, but imply what is being done to the victim. The torture scenes and the inclusion of Italian collaborators with the occupying Germans is cutting edge for 1945.Rossellini also indulges in one of his favorite things to do: Killing animals for the entertainment of the cinematic audience. Having seen him also do this in \"Stromboli\" (1950), this is my biggest peeve with him. While the audience does not see either of the two sheep actually being shot, there is no doubt they both were while the camera was operating and the crew watched. Sure I am angry about this, but this is only a small part of \"Open City\". This film remains essential viewing. I just wish someone had challenged Rossellini by informing him that any idiot can point a camera in this direction to wake the audience up. An elite filmmaker would not need to resort to this. Overall, the acting is outstanding. Fabrizi as the priest, Magnani as the young widow, Pagliero as resistance hero and Francesco Grandjacquet as the kind Francesco are all probably legends to Italians. However, the woman portraying the lesbian spy doesn't really work for me; she is too one-dimensional in her speech. It has been mentioned by other reviewers that \"Open City's\" chief flaw when viewing it today is seeing very homosexual, decadent Nazis relaxing in a lavish chamber. The lesbian subplot is noticeably over-the-top. Western culture has evolved much with regards to LGBT preferences, and \"Open City\" is not strong here.While it is easy to find flaws when viewing this from a twenty-first century prism, we should recall that Rossellini has always held a commanding perch in Italian cinema. One of his more famous admirers is my choice for cinema's greatest actress, Ingrid Bergman. (During \"Stromboli\", Bergman broke up her especially rich collaboration with Alfred Hitchcock to become Rossellini's lover and leading actress.) Rosselini deserves respect as a pioneer of neo-realism. His techniques effectively depict the misery of life. Because \"Open City\" is as unsparing as the real occupation, and resistance fighters are immortalized while traitors are revealed, it likely inspired great pride with the Italian public emerging from its collective nightmare.While Rossellini is often described as filming \"Open City,\" like a documentary, the opposite is true. For example, the Germans will shoot a much beloved woman running after the truck driven by the Gestapo as they arrest her Italian fianc\u00e9. The perspective is from the retreating car; the view of the fianc\u00e9. Rossellini is identifying point of view, which is supposedly a no-no in documentaries. Rossellini will also arrange objects in his interiors to move the story along. (How about the wild looking chair that the tipsy Nazi is sitting in when his lone voice speaks against the barbarity of his class?) The director once said, \"I try to capture reality, nothing else (Rossellini)\". However, he certainly is manipulating reality to achieve his results.The use of foreshadowing is particularly memorable. For example, an early scene with Don Pietro Pellegrini (Aldo Fabrizi), the heroic priest, shows him being hit in the head by a falling soccer ball as young schoolboys around him laugh. There is Pina's introduction (Anna Magnani) when she emerges from a bread riot almost too dizzy to stand. The two sheep will predict two subsequent fatalities, etc. With some quibbles, the narrative is written well.Despite its weaknesses, \"Open City,\" is a must-see for cinephiles. The courage to resist Fascism in defiance of its sheer brutality inspires democracy activists today. Let's not forget that the current US government sponsors torture. Also, the US President has renewed a law which he claims grants him the right to execute or indefinitely detain US citizens. \"Rome, Open City,\" is very relevant in this time.",

Made in 1945 after the Allied liberation, it feels cathartic, as if the torrent of anger and emotion that's built up during the war is finally able to be unleashed, but rather than the joy that usually comes with release, there's an exhausted despondency that finds its only hope in the pristine faith of its children. Rossellini and his writers, Sergio Amidei and Federico Fellini, don't bother to disguise their intense hatred for the Germans (and, in snide asides, their Fascist brethren), viewing them as pathetically proud monsters with a perverted tunnel vision, but they do allow them to have a conscience in the form of a drunken Nazi officer (Joop van Hulzen) denouncing his race's barbarianism. With the galvanizing Anna Magnani representing both the fury and despair of a repressed people, it's a classic example of film's importance, when required, as the voice of a traumatized cultural psyche.",

For me there are also a lot of negatives: amateurish action scenes, a highly voyeuristic approach (the women are almost always dressing or undressing and the last shot of Magnani is particularly inappropriate - not to give anything away), a use of grand guignol towards the end that caters to the lowest common denominator; the handling of suspense is limp, the films contains homophobic leitmotifs and half baked ideological rhetoric, and uses visibly thin and unenthusiastic POWs used as German extras. Some of these criticisms are written off by commentators as \"of their time\", but I think great art always transcends its time (and to be more explicit, its prejudices).

            "content": "Roberto Rossellini's 'Rome, Open City' is widely regarded as the film that marked the real rise of the films that collectively came to be classified as the films belonging to the movement known as Italian Neorealism. This is the film that is heralded as the one that ushered in a gritty, non-conventional and ultra realistic style of storytelling. This is also the first film in Rossellini's 'War Trilogy'.'Rome, Open City' is a film that has a very clear idea of what it wants to accomplish. From a certain angle, this is a propaganda film. This film makes no effort to blur the distinctions between good and evil. The Italians in the film are the good guys who are fighting the evil German Nazis. The screenplay by Sergio Amidei, Federico Fellini and Rossellini himself which was being written during when Rome was still under German occupation, in a thematic sense serves two functions - first of all the film showed the world the reality of what the Italians had to endure during the Nazi occupation, secondly the film was also clearly is a clarion call to all the Italian citizens to rise up together against the Nazis. This latter intent is clear from the way the narrative is structured. In the film, people from various sections of Italian society join forces to aid the resistance against the Nazis. Rossellini uses characters with contradictory mindsets and ideas. Don Pietro is a Catholic priest while Georgio is an atheistic rebel who holds Communist ideologies. While Pina is a working class single mother, her sister Lauretta and her friend Marina are performers. Rossellini weaves a narrative where all these colourful individuals come together with the ominous constant Nazi presence looming over them.This was a classic example where I admired the film, admired the intention and the motive of the film and I can also acknowledge how influential it is, but I couldn't end up loving the film the way I expected or wanted to. I am fascinated by the circumstances under which the film was made which involved Rossellini buying film stocks in the black market at lower rates which is the reason why the film looks very grainy and visually choppy. I love to listen to others who love the film like Scorsese talk about it and I can also appreciate all the reasons why people talk about it so highly, but while watching the film, I found some elements in the film that I couldn't get behind.While the film was very realistic for its time, it still at the heart of it is very one dimensional in its approach to telling the story. There is a clear emphasis made to make almost every Italian character(except one who gets lured in by greed) look righteous and morally upright while every German Nazi soldier is the stereotypical villain. I can completely understand why Rossellini made that artistic choice, but for a film that is heralded so much as this ultra realistic piece of cinema,I expected a more complicated and layered depiction of the interplay between the Italians and Germans in the film. Except one German soldier who is made to redeem himself to some extent with an honest introspective monologue, pretty much all the Germans are cookie-cutter shallow villains. In 'Schindler's List', Spielberg gave the character played by Ralph Fiennes some depth. He was a horrible human being, but Spielberg gives us a few quite moments with the character and his interaction in these scenes with the Jewish characters tells us a lot about his prejudice and his insecurities and this provides depth to an otherwise deplorable character. The lack of depth in the German characters and the unconditional righteousness of the Italians in 'Rome, Open City' is understandable, but it also limits my admiration for the film and makes it a bit too simple. Another aspect of the film that makes it outdated is the way Rossellini uses homosexuality. Homosexuality is depicted in a very negative light by making a detestable German officer effeminate and another devious female German officer a lesbian. It's almost as if homosexuality is made to look like it stands against the ideal conventions of society and and culture that one should stand for.However saying all that, I did also find a lot of things that I liked in the film. For me the best things about the film are Anna Magnani as Pina and Aldo Fabrizi as Don Pietro Pellegrini. Magnani gives a lot of weight to the character of Pina. She is strong, she makes her opinions heard and she is in her own way helping the resistance. The character of Don Pietro also is an extremely interesting character. He starts off as a bumbling funny priest who get discomforted by the sight of the statue of a saint facing a nude statue. But he goes on a big journey which hardens him and makes him stand by his ideals in the face of adversity. The last shot of the film is also great as it goes along with the theme of what the future holds for the coming generations, will the current paint and struggle be worth it for the children of tomorrow.So, in a nutshell, 'Rome, Open City' is a film that I respect for what it did for cinema in general. The Cinema Verite-esque visual style of Rossellini clearly influenced millions of subsequent films and filmmakers. It's a film that I do like, but I find myself admiring it more than loving.",

            "content": "Open city is a story about Italy during WWII and the pain inflicted on its people. It is considered by most to be the first Neo-realist movie and, as an Italian-American, it changed my life. It's themes are simple yet poetic; in fact, despite the poor quality of the actual film (scrated and dark at times), its themes are so transparent and well communicated that these flaxes often go unnoticed. The ending is operatic and the feelings of the viewer are never spared (this is a good thing, I promise). This is real life at its most raw, most hurt, and most honest. Yet, there are undeniable themes of survival and heroic acts by the common man. This movie represents Italy and the character of its people (the filmmaker - Rossellini - and the citizens).",

            "content": "It depicts its essence within its characters while the theme circles around faith. Much of Rossellini's pictures are somewhat a representation of this. Here the characters must escape or adapt the new federal law. Nazi forces have mobilized into Rome and the generals are tasked to sniff out any resistant leaders. This takes our main characters down several rabbit holes eventually leading into a torture; portraying the harsh brutality of World War 2. The movie undermines each character in better and worst situations. Most of them never prove within their strength. Rather they body themselves to fit in while others go against. It is the resistant characters who are trialled horribly and the general who is stern in approach. With each decision, our protagonists spiral into a lack of control. Ultimately, it leads to violence.There are tender moments however, between the lovers, a family, a couple and a priest where they find solidarity. This is its undertone and depicted gracefully through the acting. Then, after the first act, the movie climes its summit religious like. Death arrives, and the harsh reality turns into a darker bitterer atmosphere. Then, the final moments with the priest and the children direct us to a company of children with strength in their hearts and faith by their side. This is the third act in which it binds the tangent of the movie. With each directional point, it is presented with such a humane behaviour by Rossellini. Improvisational and spontaneous yet controlled by the editing. It's seamless. The acting is similarly yielded with praise, especially from the priest and the mother. We the audience encapsulates the essence and spirit that stands triumphant. Respectfully and rightfully, a great movie of history and of the human heart.",

            "content": "This is easily one of the handful of films that a discerning and sensitive film viewer should have seen and experienced. Powerful, uncompromising, it concerns the resistance in Nazi-occupied Rome during WWII. Its focus is personal, with the themes at the same time being universal and breathtaking. Individuals striving to do the right thing in the face of constant harassment and persecution. Individuals willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to serve what is right and just. (I will give little detail about the action in the film because spoilers, even just traces of spoilers, are an abomination to a film-goer who wants to see a movie freshly and on its own terms.) There are magnificent, rich performances by actors that shame the shallow acting we get in almost all films today. The focus in the movie is on the spiritual as well as the political. In these times, in which so many people and institutions are acting cravenly in the face of terrorism and intimidation, in which newspapers are afraid to publish the truth because it would not be politically correct, this film shows us how to live with nobility and according to just principles. In this film, the bullies are the Nazis. And Rossellini, the director, shows us courageous, principle-abiding people who do what is right even when the shadow of death is relentlessly present.The film pulls no punches; it is unsparing in its realistic portrayal of what happens to people who really fight the true fight against the forces of evil. The film moves inexorably to its tragic and triumphant end--forcing the viewer to examine the way he lives his own life and what he would be willing to do for truth and justice in the most difficult of situations. But this film is not dour or depressing; its cumulative effects are brilliantly uplifting. I applaud this movie over and over. Please don't be put off by its being in black and white, with no technological wizardry and with subtitles (It's in Italian). See this film. It is essential.",
