            "content": "The screen adaption of Ernest Hemingway's To Have and Have Not enjoys its place in cinematic history because it is the first screen teaming of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. Turns out to have been a personal milestone for the both of them as well.I was watching my VHS copy of To Have and Have Not today and included was the movie trailer and in it Warner Brothers announced it was introducing two exciting new screen personalities, Lauren Bacall and Dolores Moran. Ms. Moran was pretty enough and gave a nice performance as the wife of the resistance leader, but some careers take off and some don't. Didn't hurt Lauren that she married her leading man either.The location of our story is Martinique right after the fall of France in 1940. As a French colonial possession Martinique fell into the hands of the Vichy collaborationist government. They didn't get free of them until 1943, months after the Germans occupied all of France in November of 1942. Humphrey Bogart is an expatriate American along the lines of his Richard Blaine character in Casablanca. He doesn't own a swank nightclub, he's just got a charter fishing boat that lives on and runs with an alcoholic pal, Walter Brennan. But like in Casablanca, a shooting in a nightclub of his client Walter Sande gets him involved with the local Vichy police and the politics of the island. It also gets him involved with Lauren Bacall who's just looking for a way to get back to the USA. She's not above a little light fingered action to help herself, but all that does is get her introduced to Bogey. And their sizzling scenes made cinematic history.To Have and Have Not is fortunate to have the presence of Hoagy Carmichael one of the greatest musical talents America ever produced. He plays Cricket, the club piano player and he sings and plays Hong Kong Blues one of his greatest songs. Hoagy also wrote for this film, How Little We Know, which Bacall sings for her supper. Dan Seymour and Sheldon Leonard play a couple of especially smarmy Vichy police officials. They have the upper hand until the very end when tables get turned rather suddenly. The only two film I've ever seen something turn that quickly is John Ford's Wagonmaster and the Richard Widmark police drama, Madigan. You can only push Bogey just so far.Even in revivals today when Lauren Bacall tells Bogey all he need do is whistle and she'll come running, the whistles of affection will go up in theater. As well they should.",

            "content": "Each viewing of \"To Have and Have Not\" earns my greater appreciation of the film. The comparisons to \"Casablanca\" are numerous and fans of Humphrey Bogart will have no trouble picking them out one by one. Bogey's character Harry Morgan is once again an expatriate on foreign soil, though here he has no trouble calling himself an American. The Peter Lorre part is handled by Marcel Dalio as hotel owner Frenchy, while the Sydney Greenstreet presence is given to Dan Seymour, the smarmy Gestapo captain. Add the smoldering presence of Lauren Bacall in her screen debut, and you have the ingredients for an adventure film that almost plays out stronger in each of it's mini chapters than in the sum of it's parts. That's OK though, because each tableaux presents us with rich characterization and a sense that we know who these players are and what they're up to.As most fans know, the legendary Bogey/Bacall team up began here, so I won't dwell on that. What's worth mentioning though is Bacall's brazen confidence in carrying out her role in what looks like a casting call mismatch. Only a teenager at the time of filming, she looks to be about thirty, with dialog that belies her years. Though her scenes with Bogart are electric even to this day, it's worth noting her chemistry with Dolores Moran near the end of the film. The times \"Slim\" and Mrs. de Bursac appear together, their subliminal clash over \"Steve\" fairly screams \"meow\". That's why it's all the more comical when Bogey's character begins his operation on Paul, \"Slim\" uses a leaf fan to waft chloroform fumes in the direction of the fainted madame - outrageous!My first introduction to Walter Brennan was his famous TV role as Grandpa McCoy in \"The Real McCoys\" series of the late 1950's. Here, with a hitch in his giddyup, Brennan sports an early tryout for that television role, but with a reliance on alcohol. He's fairly philosophical about it though - \"Drinkin' don't bother my memory, if it did I wouldn't drink. You see, I'd forget how good it was, then where'd I be, start drinkin' water again\". The best exchange between Eddie (Brennan) and Harry takes place on board the fishing boat as Harry explains the kind of danger they might be in. It's a masterful dialog that brings Eddie to sobriety real quick.The film's sinister side is revealed when Vichy authorities intend to disrupt any activity that might prove detrimental to German interests. As the Free French resistance look for a suitable base to continue their opposition on the island of Martinique, Captain Renard (Seymour) warns Morgan and company - \"We are only interested in those persons who have broken the rules laid down for their behavior\". Morgan is busy breaking the rules all over the place, and gets right down to the frightening business at hand by roughing up Renard and his bunch when it appears his time on the island is growing short. Here, letters of transit are known as harbor passes, in another nod to Bogey's better known film.Today's viewing of the film was my third, and as mentioned earlier, it gets better each time. It helps that Humphrey Bogart is my favorite actor, but that begs the question, did Bogey make the films, or did the films make the actor. As in \"Casablanca\", \"The Maltese Falcon, \"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" and \"The Big Sleep\", the events and characters come together to create an unforgettable story. And if for no other reason, no matter how many times you watch \"To Have and Have Not\", it's always worth watching right to the very end, even if just to catch Lauren Bacall's sweet sashay to the strains of Hoagy Carmichael's piano.",

            "content": "Director Howard Hawks made a bet with Ernest Hemingway, stating that he could make a good movie out of Hemingway's worst novel. I don't know who won or how much the bet was for, but my money is on Hawks.Set on the island of Martinique, Hawks' \"To Have and Have Not\" stars Humphrey Bogart as a suave fisherman who rents his boat and services to anyone with money. Alongside him is Lauren Bacall's Marie Browning, a weary traveller who falls in love with him. They call each other by nicknames - she's \"Slim\" and he's \"Steve\" - but there's no mush between them. Their romantic scenes mostly consist of witty dialogue, written by William Faulkner and Jules Furthman, but played like a chess match. Consider a scene in which Bacall kisses Bogey. Bogey asks what the verdict is, she tells him she dosn't know yet and goes in for another. Walter Brennan, in one of his greatest roles, plays the rummy Eddie, who thinks he takes care of Bogie when in reality it's the other way around. The movie never questions their relationship. Clearly Eddie is an alcoholic, and a pain in the butt, but Bogey's loyalty to him is unfaltering. We thus know that when Bogey is eventually asked to help the French resistance, he can't say no, despite his barbed dialogue and tough-guy facade. Some scholars will tell you that Hawks' films are about male bonding, but they're about bonding, period. And notice that Bacall's character bonding with Bogey is more central to the story than even Bogey and Brennan. Of course such strong female characters are typical in Hawks' films. Consider Rita Hayworth in \"Only Angels Have Wings\", Bacall again in \"The Big Sleep\" and Ann Sheridan in \"I Was a Male War Bride\". But of all these women, Bacall makes the biggest impression. She was discovered by Hawks' wife from a magazine photo, and she fell into cinema with great ease, with her gruff voice, strong face, and soft eyes. She never had another role as good as this one.Hawks was, above all, a storyteller. His eye for characters, actors, locations, music, timing, pace, and for cutting out the boring crap, was impeccable. Take one particular moment of intensity in which Bogey shoots one of the bad guys from a gun concealed in a desk drawer. He then pulls out the gun and aims it at the remaining thugs. After a moment, he realises his hand is shaking. \"Look at that,\" he says to the bad guys. \"Isn't that silly?\" He shifts the gun to his other, steadier hand. \"That's how close you came.\" \"To Have and Have Not\" offers some good adventure, romance (both on and off screen), and is a great example of a particular type of writing. The only positive that big-brother \"Casablanca\" has over it - both films essentially tell the same tale of war-time responsibility - is in its use of space. Rick's bar (in Casablanca) is chartered by Michael Curtiz's camera in such a way that it almost becomes a place you'd like to visit, or feel you already have. It's a three dimensional space, and we're given a tour of every nook and cranny.In contrast, Hawks is a two dimensional director. He is unable to flesh out the bars and \"Casablanca\" inspired Hotel in which his film largely takes place. We get great lighting, great compositions, but it's all flat. We don't feel like this is a tangible, real space. Hawks' command of mood, editing, lighting and music almost makes up for this, but not quite.8.9/10 - Underrated.",

            "content": "This film has nothing to do with the Ernest Hemingway's book, which is not one of his best novels. Howard Hawks took a big gamble in trying to have the great Hemingway write the screen treatment, but Papa didn't comply with the request. Instead, Mr. Hawks hired two other writers to work on the scenario for this movie, William Faulkner and Jules Furthman, not too shabby a combination! Mr. Hawks had an enormous talent for giving the American public films that were entertaining, as well as well crafted. Mr. Hawks is responsible for discovering Lauren Bacall, a young model from New York with no experience in the cinema. Well, Mr. Hawk's instinct paid handsomely as Lauren Bacall went to have a fabulous career of her own.This film is interesting as well, for it marked the beginning of the romance between Mr. Bogart and Ms. Bacall. Their love is there in front of the viewers to see. This movie shows us a Bogey with a heart. He was an actor that excelled in this type of picture and under Mr. Hawks's direction, his Capt. Morgan makes a remarkable impression.The story has all the right ingredients to keep us interested in what is going on with all these characters in Martinique. World War II makes a detour and comes to the island.The cast for this movie is first rate. Humphrey Bogart is a tough Capt. Morgan who falls head over heels for young and lovely \"Slim\" Browning, a mysterious young woman who loves adventure. Ms. Bacall has a way to sing a song that makes it unique because of her sense of style. Both these stars smolder the screen in their love scenes.Walter Brennan plays Eddie, the drunken sailor that helps Morgan take tourists on fishing junkets. Marcel Dalio, is Frenchy, the owner of the local hotel; he is the one responsible for putting Morgan in touch with the partisans operating in the island. Dolores Moran and Walter Szurovy are the De Bursac, who are smuggled into the island by Morgan, at his own risk; they are sought by the local branch of the Gestapo.Hoagy Carmichael, the great musician puts an appearance as Cricket, a pianist that entertains at the hotel lounge. The three musical numbers are done flawlessly. Mr. Carmichael's rendition of \"Hong Kong blues\" stays in one's mind forever. Also we hear two other of his songs, \"Am I blue?\", and a sultry rendition by Lauren Bacall of his hit, \"How little we know\". Hearing sung by Bacall makes any other interpretation superfluous.This is a film to see to enjoy great acting under the magnificent direction of Howard Hawks.",

            "content": "Lauren Bacall, who gave men the license to whistle, was blessed by nature with two advantages: the personality of a buddy and the look of a Femme Fatale... This combination initially took the only 19-years-old actress to the top with her first two films \u0096 'To Have and Have Not' and 'The Big Sleep' \u0096 scoring a success even the deadpan expressions of a Buster Keaton could not undermine... It helped, of course, to be co-starred in them with Humphrey Bogart who fell in love with her during shooting, and to have Howard Hawks, who deliberately set out to prove that he could make her a star, directing her every move in the same totally controlled way Joseph Von Sternberg had done with Marlene Dietrich... 'To Have and Have Not' is an almost unrecognizable adaptation of the Hemingway novel... The Rick character again appears, though with a new name... The film is a fairly routinely adventure, with a plot that isn't all that interesting, and with a frequently laughable dialog, but it sparks into life when Bogart and the leading blonde, with whom he is deeply in love and to whom he will later be married, appear...The girl is Lauren Bacall, in her first movie... Cool, smooth, and gorgeous, she sets the screen on fire from her first entrance... She was a new kind of heroine...Opposite Bogart she was colorful and believable... She had no illusions about herself... She was used to getting by, making out as best she could... She wanted Bogey and she let him know it... She offers herself to him, bravely and without shame: ' You know you don't have to act with me, Steve. You don't have to say anything and you don't have to do anything. Not a thing. Oh, maybe just whistle. (She opens his door and pauses.) You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together - and blow.'With the effective use of her sexy, sultry, speaking voice and her confident eyes, Howard Hawks creates a new screen image, and one of the most sizzling yet sexual propositions on film... Lauren Bacall has become heir to our memories of the truly memorable star of the 1940s, and, in her own way, one of them...\"To Have or Have Not\" was remade as \"The Breaking Point\" with John Garfield and \"The Gun Runners\" with Audie Murphy and both were, inferior to the original",

            "content": "This is almost a clone of the more-famous \"Casablanca\".....and almost as good! The film is very entertaining from the get-go with all three leading actors a lot of fun to watch. I am referring to Lauren Bacall, Humphrey Bogart and Walter Brennan.This was Bacall's first film. She was 19 years old, looked 30 and never looked better. Her face, at that time, was stunningly beautiful, mesmerizing at times. So is her dialog, capped off by the famous line, asking Bogart if he knows how to whistle. It isn't just the line, it's the way she says it.....and Bogart's reaction. Bogart is outstanding, just as he was in Casablanca. Same type of character: an apolitical American overseas who reluctantly winds up helping fight the Nazis. As for Brennan, normally I don't find drunks appealing, just sloppy and obnoxious. However, Brenenan is neither here; he''s simply fun to watch and someone you can't help but like. I think he was one of the more underrated actors of his time.The story had a good blend of intrigue, action, suspense, comedy, beautiful women, great characters and great dialog. It''s too bad it has nowhere near the notoriety of Casablanca. It 's only a small notch below it.",

            "content": "Set during the first few months of World War II, this Howard Hawks thriller stars Humphrey Bogart as a politically neutral American living overseas who reluctantly becomes instrumental in the safe transportation of a French Resistance fighter and his loyal wife. From such a plot summary alone, 'To Have and Have Not' might sound a lot like 'Casablanca', and the influence is hard to deny. To the film's credit, lead actress Lauren Bacall is arguably more effective than Ingrid Bergman and some of the dialogue matches 'Casablanca' in how snappy it is (\"I'd walk home if wasn't for all the water\" plus the famous whistling line), however, generally speaking, this comes off as a pale version of 'Casablanca'. Bogart's character does not have heartbreak or much in the way of cynicism to overcome, the supporting characters are nowhere near as colourful or charismatic and the film's patriotic stance is really drilled in towards the end. All the acclaim thrown Bacall's way over the years is very much justified though with every dialogue exchange between herself and Bogie ranging from memorable to utterly breathtaking. The film is sadly nowhere near as electric in the moments when Bacall is not on screen (and she is absent from around half the film), but the chemistry between the two main players is enough to recommend the film throughout its lulls.",

            "content": "Harry Morgan owns a fishing boat for hire on the small island of Martinique. France has fallen and tensions are high, although Harry is happy to stay out of it and just earn his money. However an offer to carry some revolutionaries off the island sees him caught up in police suspicions when the deal comes to light. This, combined with his attraction to fellow American \"Slim\" Browning forces Harry to re-evaluate his \"out for himself\" values.Although the continued success of this film owes a lot to the pairing of Bogart and Bacall, there is enough going for the rest of the film to make it stand up down the years. The plot is very interesting in Hawks look at a man who tries to take a distanced approach to the problem of others before standing up to be counted; I don't know enough about the period to really know what context he was putting this forward in but it is still interesting enough and does make the character of Steve/Harry a lot more complex. The plot goes down a standard road of wartime thriller but it is still very engaging and well told. The direction is top notch and has a real sense of atmosphere despite the production being limited to soundstages.Of course a major reason the film works is the cast. Bogart does \"downbeat but ultimately heroic\" better than many others and he does it well here \u0096 tough, smart and morally challenged. Bacall has less of a character to speak of but she makes up for that by sheer force of personality; personally I don't find her that attractive but she fair sparks across the screen and her delivery is very sexual throughout. The two fell in love during the film and it does show on screen, with a great chemistry and real sexual tension between them \u0096 a heavy amount of classic scenes and hot moments also helps. Support is good from Brennan and Seymour but the \"Free French\" are not that well developed and are not as interesting as they should have been.Overall this is a classic film with an interesting plot, interesting characters, a tough and heavy atmosphere, good performances and a central duo that really spark off each other. It may be a standard wartime thriller on the surface but everything seems to come together really well and produce a film that is memorable for a collection of reasons.",

            "content": "It's kind of like \"Sex and the Single Girl\" or \"What You've Always Wanted to Know About Sex.\" The titles are familiar or engaging enough to justify building a complete story from scratch. (See also, \"The Best of Sex and Violence,\" which is the greatest title ever dreamed up, far superior to, say, \"Henry IV, Part Two.\") The novel opens and closes with slam bang action scenes and there isn't much in between to draw us to the characters. One-armed guys can be good heroes or villains, but not heroes who lose.The story is that Howard Hawks and Hemingway were having drinks and that Hawks claimed he could take even Hemingway's lousiest novel and make a successful movie out of it. They agreed that \"To Have And Have Not\" was about the lousiest and the bet was made. Evidently Furthman threw the contents of the novel out of the window except for the general Caribbean setting, Harry Morgan's occupation as skipper, and the names of some of the characters.It's doubtful that Hawks truly enjoyed himself during the shooting. He had a habit of hiring delicious young women for his movies and then, well, then bonding with them. In this case, he had his eye on Bacall, who was 18 years old, but she bonded with Bogart instead. Hawks also had a habit of avoiding actors who stole his women and punishing the women too, so it was Bogart's next-to-last film with Hawks. It wasn't the first time. In Kirk Douglas's movie with Hawks, the actor stole Elizabeth Threatt, a major masochist, who came like water and like the wind she went. And it was good-bye to both John Ireland and Joanne Dru after \"Red River.\" Poor Hawks.The writers, which evidently included Jules Furthman and William Faulkner, built up a story that sizzled with sexuality at the time of its release but seems like of loose-limbed, gangly, and amusing today. (The oft-parodied scene in which Bacall tells Bogart how to whistle -- \"You just put your lips together -- and blow.\") Hawks had an affinity for boy's adventure book values. You know, a man rediscovers his pride or sobriety and overcomes his demons and whatnot. It's pretty lowbrow stuff unless you want to get into conjectural homoerotic themes. But Hawks had a solid sense of humor too. He had a tendency to rework scenes so that they had gag lines in them or amusing bits of business. This one has its funny moments too, as well as a bit of action.None of it is either gripping or believable but it's fun to watch. Bogart and Bacall really hit it off on screen. Her movements are so languorous. She hunches over a bit when she walks, like some tall women do. And her voice -- it's down there in the subwoofer range. At the end, when she and Bogie and Walter Brennan walk out of the bar, Hoagy Carmichael plays a lively little tune and Bacall does a sort of shimmy that must have sent shivers up the male spines of 1944.While I think of it, I'll give an example of what I meant by \"amusing bits of business.\" The scene -- a French patriot must have a bullet extracted from his shoulder by Bogart. Several people stand around watching tensely. As Bogart probes the bullet hole, another beautiful woman, who Bacall is jealous of, faints to the floor. Bacall is administering ether from a spray can and Bogart tells her to fan the fumes away from the bed or they'll all be out. When Bacall notices that no one is watching her, she hastily fans the gas down towards the body of her unconscious rival. It isn't much, just a second or two, but it adds to our understanding of what's going on and is meanly funny.Not Hawks' best but enjoyable viewing.",

            "content": "Most film fans know the famous bet made between Ernest Hemingway and legendary director Howard Hawks (SCARFACE, BRINGING UP BABY).  Hawks claimed he could make a good film out of Hemingway's worst novel.  He does and Hemingway hopefully paid up.  The great author must have forgot the star power Hawks had in access to in Bogart and Walter Brennan because that is exactly what drives the film.  They are backed by the writing of William Faulkner and the direction of Hawks, who is always able to have his actors deliver slick lines quickly and effectively to have the story run smoothly. Oh yeah, an actress named Betty Bacall makes her debut opposite these screen legends and makes what I consider the most auspicious debuts of any actress from the 1940's.  She meshes well with Bogie, trading quips and matching her future hubby line for line.  The real star of TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT is Howard Hawks, a director who could create comedy, suspense, and art amidst a rather dull story.I never read Hemingway's novel, so I couldn't tell you whether it was his worst.  I believe Hemingway made the gesture and Hawks showed him up. Notice touches of the previous year's all-time classic CASABLANCA (this time the owner of the foreign booze bar is the roulette manager from CASABLANCA). World War II is a backdrop, Bogie is a cynic with that heart of gold, and he helps his \"rummy\" buddy, played by Walter Brennan.  Bogie helped the low-life likes of Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet in 'Blanca and in this one, his scenes with Brennan are comic relief.  Brennan plays a funny drunk who is prone to spilling his guts after a few rums.  Bogie's \"Harry Morgan\" rents his boat to rich Americans for fishing and will lend a hand towards the French war effort with his sailing skills much like his power to give the infamous \"letters of transport\" to Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid. Similarities aside, there is an original piece of work to see in this well-paced semi-thriller, with Bogie, Bacall, and Hawks to send them sailing into cinematic history.\"Just put your lips together and blow,\" will live in filmgoer's minds forever, as will the fact that Bogart and Bacall practically fall in love right in front of our eyes.  A problem I had with the film was the annoying interference of the copycat (CASABLANCA) French police.  Sorry, no Claude Rains to add some spice to it.  I understand the movie contrasts starkly with the novel, depicting the characters at an earlier age.  It is predictable and you know which girl is Bogart's.  It is entertaining to see Walter Brennan squirm and tick as a hopeless alcoholic who can't seem to remember a conversation that took place 5 minutes prior.  True, Hawks has no official writing credit, but the film has that Hawks touch because of the humor and genuine quality the main characters present.  TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT is a picture to sit back and watch as brash, Hollywood filmmaking of the 1940's and a nice piece of classic Hawks who moved onto THE BIG SLEEP with Bogart and Bacall soon after.  Its good but not the best of Hawks or Bogart.\nRATING: 7 OF 10",

Even the writer William Faulkner is in on recasting (and making almost invisible) Ernest Hemingway's novel.But this says \"Casablanca\" all over it, from the opening shot of a map on. Then throw in Humphrey Bogart and a Sidney Greenstreet wannabe, have an engaging piano player at the center of the popular nightclub, and set it in an exotic part of the French Empire where the war is raging but you can hardly tell. Director Howard Hawks seems to be winking all the way to the box office and no one else seems to know it.Not that people aren't trying hard. Certainly the romance has gone from some archetypal, dreamy impossibility (with Ingrid Bergman in \"Casablanca\") to a very earthy and valid (and real) romance with Lauren Bacall. That's actually a big reason this movie has such fame, because the Bogart/Bacall chemistry is right there for us to watch, and I mean the people, not the characters. Another reason is Walter Brennan, who is so odd and so convincing at the same time you have to wonder. I think Hoagy Carmichael has to be appreciated, too, more than he usually is. He has a major secondary role, and is in the movie more than almost anyone, playing the piano in all kinds of moods...and really playing it, and singing, too (along with Bacall, a little).But all this stuff never actually gels the way it should. It's almost like it knows it's imitative and so it doesn't try for actual high stakes drama or romance. If you think otherwise, give \"Casablanca\" another look, and besides much better screen writing, and much better photography, you'll see some basic emotional wires attached that are only superficial here--the War itself, for one thing, and patriotism, and love lost (rather than just love found), and sacrifice of all kinds. And some character actors to beat the band--there is no one here to match Peter Lorre, or Sidney Greenstreet.These are fair comparisons because Hawks invites them. But since it is all knowing, does that make this a commercial one-off, the director and his buddy Bogart winking, at least, at each other? Maybe. Or maybe it's the first dip into an irony about movies, and about the reality and artificiality that goes with that, that is deliberate and yet can't show its hand too clearly because the audience is frankly not as jaded and cold as the people making the movies. It's a really fun movie, but it'll keep you on the surfaces, and if you want depth, don't be disappointed.",

            "content": "Loosely based on Ernest Hemmingway's novel, To Have And Have Not features crisp dialogue, seamless direction from Howard Hawks and top tier acting. But be that as it may, the film is best remembered for the coupling of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, who quickly took their on screen romance out into the real world. The rest as they say is history.The story is set in the Caribbean city of Fort de France, Martinique, shortly after the fall of France to the Germans. Harry 'Steve' Morgan (Bogart) is a world wise fishing boat captain who is wanted to do a secretive people smuggle from a nearby island for the French Resistance. Initially very reluctant, Harry has to take on the job when a series of events leave him flat broke. Also into his life comes Marie 'Slim' Browning (Bacall), an American pickpocket who has come to the island more by default than design. So with his alcoholic pal in tow {Walter Brennan} and the Gestapo breathing down his neck, Harry has a whole heap of issues suddenly making his once neutral and tranquil life explosive.Legend has it that Hemingway & Hawks were involved in a debate one day during one of their fishing trips in Florida. The out-shot of that argument was that Hawks proclaimed he could make a winner of a movie out of what he considered was Hemingway's worst novel, To Have & Have Not. Hawks duly delivered this hugely endearing, often funny and entertaining movie that is a lesson in on screen chemistry and finely tuned writing {Jules Furthman and William Faulkner}. The similarities to Casablanca are many, so in that, this is weak by comparison. In fact dig away the buzzing like atmosphere here and you find a pretty weak plot. But in its purest escapist form the film is a triumph. Savvy, sexy and not short on suspense, To Have And Have Not holds up to its classic status. 8/10",

            "content": "Well, was you? That's Eddie's (Walter Brennan) inexorable question all throughout \"To Have and Have Not\" to anyone within earshot. And it's only the 3rd or 4th best line in the movie. Seems there's this one line where one person tries to teach another person how to whistle. And another one after a passionate kiss when a gal tells a guy that it's even better when he helps. Duh! But I like what happens after yet another passionate smooch between Bogie and Bacall. She pulls away and says to him, \"You need a shave,\" after which she immediately love-slaps his unshaven face. It's her way of telling him without words that she's attracted to him and she really doesn't give a good hoot whether he shaves or not.By now, just about everyone knows that this movie is all about \"Steve\" (Humphrey Bogart) and \"Slim\" (Lauren Bacall). In their first movie together, the two exhibit an explosive chemistry rarely seen from any other actor-actress combo. As one watches the movie, with the great Howard Hawks putting the two thru their various paces, one simultaneously imagines the two of them falling in love offscreen -- which they did! -- just as they do in this movie. For more on this, I highly recommend Lauren's autobiography -- \"By Myself.\" In that book, she talks about the two of them sneaking around to see each other like a couple of teenagers -- which she was! As I recall, Bogie was still married at the time -- though estranged from Mayo Methot.As for \"T H a H N,\" there are many other fine elements that make it well worth one's time. A pretty good storyline revolving around the Free French contesting the Vichy French (Nazi collaborators) in Martinique during the early days of World War II. A strong supporting cast much reminiscent of the one in \"Casablanca.\" Great dialogue by novelist William Faulkner and Jules Furthman. Also, a strong musical score (\"Am I Blue?\" -- \"How Little We Know\" -- \"Hong Kong Blues\") by Hoagy Carmichael with a strong assist from Johnny Mercer.In a very good Humphrey Bogart movie, which this certainly is, one would never suspect that a young ingenue actress, with little training or experience, could scene-steal from a polished veteran like Bogie. And I won't say that she does such in this movie. I do know that she did not want to and was not trying to (her autobiography). The fact is, however, that it took a star actor of Bogie's magnitude to keep Betty from dominating the screen with her earthy sex appeal and pure luminescence. Her sashay out of the bar in the last scene here is enough to make any man weak in the knees. No wonder Bogie tumbled! Both onscreen and off!So ..... tell me, now .....

Basically Harry 'Steve' Morgan (Humphrey Bogart) and his alcoholic sidekick Eddie (Walter Brennan), based on the island of Martinique, have a crew boat available for hire, but business is not what it could be because of the war, and one customer owes them a large sum. They are forced to take a job for the resistance transporting a fugitive away from the Nazis, and as this goes on Morgan is having a stormy relationship with resistance sympathiser and sassy singer (where Morgan spend most of his time), Marie 'Slim' Browning (introducing Lauren Bacall). There are many moments of witty and charming dialogue in the romantic scenes, and great explosions of wartime peril that you keep you gripped, I thought Bacall's singing voice was a little weird, but she is still a sexy character with a great husky talking voice. Also starring Dolores Moran as Mme. Hellene De Bursac, Hoagy Carmichael as Cricket, Walter Szurovy as Paul De Bursac and Sheldon Leonard as Lt. Coyo. I have to admit there were moments where I trailed off and didn't understand what was going on, but I can certainly see why the critics give it high praise.

I forget who played the role there. I'll have to look it up. Yes, here we are. Madeleine LeBeau). This time, the piano is tinkled by Hoagy Carmichael, and this time Bogie's pal is a rummy, name of Eddie. The police captain is no ladies man, but Dan Seymour is just as menacing, in his less subtle way, as was Claude Rains. We could continue making comparisons. What we have here is not so much Hemingway as brazenly refashioned Epstein Twins and Koch. Sure, it's most enjoyable, yes. Whilst Betty is no Bergman, Hawks no Curtiz and Hickox no Edeson, it's smart, exciting, professionally crafted entertainment. Beautifully photographed, set and staged, To Have and Have Not certainly made a marvelous debut innings for the then 19- year-old Bacall. She and Bogie really set their scenes on fire.",

            "content": "Once again, Humphrey Bogart is portraying a man who must face the reality of the rest of the world and forget about his own needs as he helps the French resistance in Martinique, controlled by the Nazis after the fall of Paris. With the help of a certain husky voiced blonde (Lauren Bacall) with a crack for every situation, Bogart does just that. This adaption of a Hemingway story was changed from the rum-running world of Cuba to the fishing world of Martinique. It is full of snap, crackle and pop, and plenty of humor from tipsy Walter Brennan in another fine performance filled with heart. Bogart and Bacall really know how to light up the screen and would do so in three other films. I watched three of their four pairings back to back, and there is no doubt; They have \"it\". Real life couples don't always sizzle on screen, but this one does, especially here as this is where they discovered each other. But this is about the story, not the real-life soon to be married couple, and it is fascinating to watch Bogart go from uninvolved boat captain to a political hero who finally decides to stick his neck out for someone. There is a nice camaraderie between Bacall and piano player Hoagy Carmichael. The scene of \"Am I Blue?\" is particularly memorable as Bacall steps into sing, the drummer with the brush slowly comes in, and Bogart takes notice. Dan Seymour is the slimy Nazi villain, while Dolores Moran is fine in a smaller part as the French woman Bogart is trying to get out of Martinique along with her resistance husband (Walter Molnar).It took me a long time to get to see this film for the first time, and it was worth the wait. They showed equal spark in their subsequent films (\"Dark Passage\" and \"Key Largo\", which I had seen years before, were the other two I watched after this; I've seen \"The Big Sleep\" numerous times) but Bacall is at her freshest here. She is one of the few stars to be a lead in her film debut that actually had a long lasting career. It is obvious that there is a tiger under the kittenish way she plays the part, and we've had more than 60 years of her wonderful face on stage, screen and television. The fishing sequence at the beginning is a great way to start the story. This is a film worth watching once a year to recall the magic, a rarity in cinema today. While there may be the obvious comparisons to \"Casablanca\" (an exotic location, a friendly piano player, an anti-Nazi sentiment), the film holds up on its own.",

Hard-boiled American boat captain in France circa 1940 becomes involved in the Wartime Resistance. Fans of Humphrey Bogart have given the picture a sterling reputation over the years--and he's typically good in it--yet all the drama adds up to very little.

Sorry, but in my view, Hawks lost the wager. No doubt he had access to a great cast. Humphrey Bogart played the lead character of Harry Morgan - a fishing boat captain on the French island of Martinique during World War II who gets caught up in helping the French Resistance. The cast also featured Walter Brennan as his rummy sidekick Eddie, and this was Lauren Bacall's film debut as Morgan's love interest Slim. Even Hoagy Carmichael appears as the piano playing Cricket. So, the cast is great; the story unfortunately less so.To me, it came across as a weak successor to the previous year's classic \"Casablanca.\" In that classic, Bogie dealt with the challenge of helping the French Resistance and dealing with the Vichy authorities in North Africa. The idea is the same here, with the action transferred to the French West Indies. But the story takes a very long time in developing - it takes about an hour before we really know what's happening. That opening hour deals largely with Morgan's business relationship with Mr. Johnson, who rented his boat for fishing - which really had little to do with the story as it finally developed, and - admittedly just my opinion - Lauren Bacall is not the world's greatest singer! Where \"Casablanca\" provided an interesting study of the dilemma of French officials who had to choose between Vichy or de Gaulle, there was none of that here. The Vichy officials portrayed seem to have no hesitations or second thoughts about serving Vichy. In the end, everything seemed to fall together far too easily. There was no great build-up of suspense; neither was there any release of tension as it ended. It's certainly worth watching for fans of Bogie and Bacall, but in all honesty it's not a great movie.",

            "content": "The film director Howard Hawks was a close friend of the writer Ernest Hemingway and, in general, was an admirer of his works. He did not, however, have a high regard for Hemingway's novel \"To Have and Have Not\", and told the author so. This led to a bet between the two men that Hawks could not make a good film of the novel. This film was the outcome. The film is nominally based on the\u00a0novel, but the plot has been altered virtually beyond recognition, although it does keep the main character, fishing-boat captain Harry Morgan. The film is, in fact, an unacknowledged remake of \"Casablanca\", with which it shares the following features:-A wartime setting in 1940 or 1941 A setting in a French colony under the\u00a0Vichy regime A world-weary American hero, played in both cases by Humphrey Bogart, who is initially cynical about the war but who later changes his mind and throws in his lot with the\u00a0French ResistanceA glamorous blonde (here Lauren Bacall rather than Ingrid Bergman) to act as the hero's love-interest. Scenes set in a bar with a jazz band and a pianist, here played by Hoagy Carmichael. (Carmichael was, of course, best known as a musician, but he did occasionally act in movies, generally playing a musician). A French Chief of Police, named Renault in \"Casablanca\" and Renard\u00a0here. The name \"Renard\" may have been deliberately chosen because of its similarity to \"Renault\", although as \"renard\" is French for \"fox\" it may also be a reference to his cunning. A gallant Resistance leader with a beautiful young wife. Hemingway's book was set in Cuba and the Florida Keys, but here the setting is changed to Martinique in the summer of 1940, shortly after the\u00a0fall of France. Morgan, who runs a business catering for big-game fishermen, is\u00a0approached by\u00a0the Resistance for assistance in smuggling two of their members onto the island. He agrees,\u00a0but only because he has been promised\u00a0payment and\u00a0is short of money, although later, of course, he becomes an enthusiastic supporter of the Free French cause. He also finds time to conduct a romance with an American girl named Marie Browning. Morgan generally calls Marie \"Slim\", a reference to Hawks's model wife Nancy who was also known by this nickname; she, for some reason, always calls him \"Steve\", although everyone else calls him by his real name, Harry. There are a few differences between this story and that of \"Casablanca\". Renault was a morally ambiguous character who eventually emerges as one of the \"good guys\"; here Renard is a straightforward villain. In \"Casablanca\" the hero's love-interest and the Resistance leader's lovely young wife were one and the same person; here they are two different people, which means that there is no love-triangle as there was in the earlier film. I doubt if \"To Have and Have Not\" will ever rank as highly in the affections of the public as \"Casablanca\", one of the most beloved films of all time. The dramatic power of the earlier movie derives not only from its \"heroes and villains\" theme of the Resistance versus the Nazis but also from the inner struggles of Rick and Ilsa, both of whom must deal with the conflict between their desire for one another and their desire to assist the Allied cause. In \"To Have and Have Not\" Harry's own internal conflict is resolved pretty early on, so the only issue left is whether the French patriots or the pro-Vichy traitors will come out on top. (And, given that the film was made in 1944, we all know the answer to that one). \"How Little We Know,\" is unlikely ever to rival \"As Time Goes By\" in any list of \"great songs from the movies\", especially as Lauren Bacall did not have the world's most melodious singing voice. (There were persistent, although untrue, rumours that she was actually dubbed by a male singer). Virtually every other line in \"Casablanca\" has become a famous quotation, but there is little to compare in this film except perhaps \"Was You Ever Bitten by a Bee?\" and \"You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and... blow\", a quote which has become famous largely because of the sexual innuendo with which Bacall manages to endow it. And yet \"To Have and Have Not\" is a very enjoyable wartime adventure film-cum-romance. Bogart gives another sterling performance in the sort of role he had made his own property, and the teenage Bacall, in her movie debut, shows that she had both the looks and the charisma which were to make her a major star. (A shame about her singing voice, though). This, of course, was the film where Bogart and Bacall first met and began the romance which was to end in their marriage. Walter Brennan provides some amusing comic relief as Morgan's drunken old reprobate of a crewman, Eddie. Besides Bacall the film also starred another beautiful young starlet, Dolores Moran, but somehow she never went on to become a star of quite the same magnitude. Hemingway's novels have not always translated well to the cinema screen; the Rock Hudson/Jennifer Jones version of \"A Farewell to Arms\", for example, and the Gary Cooper/Ingrid Bergman \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" are both monuments of tedium. Although \"To Have and Have Not\", however, is generally rated as one of the author's lesser works (by many literary critics as well as by Hawks), the film version is nevertheless a pretty decent one. I think that Hawks won his bet. 7/10",

In order to cash in on the success of this film, a story by Ernest Hemingway was re-written in a way that made it seem an awful lot like like a sequel to CASABLANCA. Sure, Bogie's name was changed and Lauren Bacall was now his co-star, but the overall plot of the film of a jaded American who, down deep, is sympathetic to the Free French cause is once again here. Because this is such a derivative film, it loses a point or two in its rating.Despite this extreme similarity, the film STILL is a wonderful old film due to great acting and a well-paced story. However, for me the biggest standout was Lauren Bacall and the wonderful dialog written for her. She is a wonderful \"Film Noir\"-like lady--a fast-talking, snappy dialog-spewing \"dame\" who really helped make the film come alive (though it was NOT technically a Noir film). Again and again and again, she had GREAT lines--not just the \"you know how to whistle?\" line, but all throughout the film. For fans of classic Hollywood, this film is a must and is among Bogart's better films.",

An American, Harry Morgan (played by Humphrey Bogart) runs a charter boat and is determined to stay out of politics and not get involved in the war. However, there are Free French sympathisers and agents who would dearly like his help. To make things more complicated, a beautiful American woman, Marie \"Slim\" Browning (played by Lauren Bacall) keeps drifting across his path... An excellent drama, based on the Ernest Hemingway novel and directed by Howard Hawks. Solid, intriguing plot. Does resemble Casablanca at times - at one point I thought it was just Casablanca transported to the Caribbean - but ultimately differentiates itself quite well from that other classic Bogart movie.Has the legendary Humphrey Bogart smoothness and coolness. Lauren Bacall is great in her film debut - cool, beautiful, stylish and doesn't take a backward step to Bogart. This would be the first of many collaborations between the two. Moreover, they would marry a year after the movie was released...Cast also includes Hoagy Carmichael as the bar's singer / band- leader, Cricket.Only two negative aspects. One is the Eddie character - quite irritating at times. Him and his flaws are necessary to the plot, however. Walter Brennan did a decent job playing him, but every time he appeared I lost some interest in the scene.The other negative is that the Bogart-Bacall dialogue battles sometimes felt overdone. There are some terrific quotes and word plays but it's as if the writer or director didn't know when to stop. These are minor issues, however, in what is a fantastic movie.",

            "content": "If Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall occupy the same screen, you can safely expect fireworks. My first Bogart-Bacall collaboration was John Huston's 'Key Largo (1948),' a solid thriller with a brilliant performance from Edward G. Robinson. However, the chemistry between Bogart and Bacall was surprisingly lacking, and, at the time, I wondered why there was such a fascination for the couple. Recent viewings of Howard Hawks' 'The Big Sleep (1946)' and 'To Have and Have Not (1944)' have completely swayed my opinion, and I am now in no doubt of the pair's potency: the sexual chemistry positively sizzles while they're both on screen! This particular film was Bacall's debut performance, the picture that introduced both audiences and Bogart {he would marry her the following year} to one of cinema's most iconic beauties, fondly remembered for her erotically husky voice. 'To Have and Have Not' is an interesting mixture of war-time adventure and hard-boiled film-noir, set on the island of Martinique under the Vichy regime, and Bogart's Harry \"Steve\" Morgan is forced to navigate swathes of low-lifes and immoral authority figures.Howard Hawks, perhaps Hollywood's most versatile master director, was a considerable fan of author Ernest Hemingway, but didn't think all too highly of his 1937 effort, \"To Have and Have Not.\" Taking it upon himself to improve the story, Hawks set his writers upon Hemingway's \"bunch of junk,\" and created what is considered by some to be one of his best films. With its abundance of pistol-clad gangsters and Bogart's legendary noble tough-guy, comparisons with other pulp film-noirs {such as 'The Maltese Falcon (1941)' and Hawks' own 'The Big Sleep'} are perfectly justified, as are the noticeable parallels with Michael Curtiz's 'Casablanca (1942),' with its intriguing war-time tale of romance and loyalty, in addition to a suitably ambiguous ending that emphasises the sheer uncertainty of warfare. A hilarious Walter Brennan provides the comedic relief as Eddie, a well-meaning but hopelessly addicted alcoholic who likes to ask people such inane queries as \"was you ever bit by a dead bee?\" Marcel Dalio, in a role that would ideally have suited Peter Lorre, is also good as Frenchy, the sincere owner of the local hotel with sympathies for the French Resistance.What ultimately separates a good film like 'To Have and Have Not' from a masterpiece like, say, 'Casablanca,' is the depth of the characters. By the end of the latter film, we feel as though we've known Rick (Bogart) and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) for their entire lives, and we feel pain for their romantic sorrows. Howard Hawks has always been more concerned with witty dialogue than character development, and, though there's no doubting the sheer entertainment of his pictures, they are rarely able to strike a chord close to the heart. Most of this film's characters are little more than two-dimensional caricatures, and the camera, in order to avoid distracting from the excellence of the screenplay, does little of any interest. 'To Have and Have Not' is certainly a solid film, but it's not exactly \"exciting\" film-making, with the exception, of course, of the coupling of Bogart and Bacall, which was a stroke of genius on Hawks' part. Also notable is the musical soundtrack, with Hoagy Carmichael appearing as a hotel piano player to perform \"Hong Kong Blues,\" and Bacall singing \"How Little We Know.\"",

            "content": "The success of \"Casablanca\" two years before undoubtedly influenced the writing of this film, which started as an adaptation of a book by Hemingway. Most of the plot and details from that book were jettisoned. The final script has Humphrey Bogart playing a business owner in a Vichy-controlled French colony who is drawn into political intrigue despite the fact that he normally avoids such involvement.Bogart's Steve is a libertarian at heart. He believes in a \"live and let live\" approach to life. Don't bother him--or his friends, or those who are unable to defend themselves--and he will not bother you. His sidekick is Eddie, a \"rummy\" who depends on Steve. Eddie (Walter Brennan) is a liability because he talks too much, but he is more than a dependent; he is \"family\". Steve runs his charter fishing service and Eddie drinks the beer.As the internal politics heat up in Martinique, Steve largely avoids being affected, though the increase in regulations are beginning to chafe. What motivates him to step outside his carefully maintained neutrality is a woman. He meets \"Slim\"--played by Lauren Bacall--a young woman with a dubious past, whose smoky presence alters the equilibrium of Steve's life.Shot in B&W on a sound stage--like \"Casablanca\"--\"To Have and Have Not\" has a moody, noir feeling that sometimes feels claustrophobic, as if the outside world does not exist. \"Key Largo\" has a similar mood. The lighting is a large part of this atmosphere. The music also plays a significant role, with Hoagy Carmichael's piano playing alternating between jazzy, sultry and tropical. Lauren Bacall's husky singing voice is the perfect complement. Watch for Sheldon Leonard who plays \"muscle\" for the mean-spirited Vichy authority who disrupts Steve's world. (An interesting comparison is Leonard's role as Harry the Horse in \"Guys and Dolls\", 1955).In the end, it is Bacall who steals the show. Her presence is the star whose gravity affects the orbits of every actor in the scene. Her little dance at the end of the film totally changes our perception of the ending and our belief what the future holds for this new family trio.",

            "content": "Humphrey Bogart plays an American who reluctantly gets mixed up with resistance fighters in a French overseas territory during World War II. Gee, where have we seen this before? As successful as Casablanca was you can't blame a studio for wanting to churn out a Casablanca imitation. But where Casablanca is undeniably a classic film To Have and Have Not comes up somewhat short. The story is not as compelling, the characters not as engaging. It's a decent film but in going so out of its way to be like Casablanca in every respect this film can't help but suffer in comparison. All the elements of Casablanca are here but all those elements worked better in the earlier film.This time rather than Morocco we're in Martinique. Bogart plays fishing-boat captain Harry Morgan. Before the client to whom Harry's been renting his boat can pay him complications ensue. And now Harry is mixed up in something he wants nothing to do with. Meanwhile a pretty young woman shows up and you just know she's going to complicate things further. Harry quite begrudgingly agrees to help the resistance fighters with their cockamamie plans. And meanwhile he falls in love with the young woman. Much of the film takes place in a nightclub with a piano player warbling away because, well because that's how they did it in Casablanca. Much as the Bogart-Bergman interactions made Casablanca spark to life here it is the chemistry between Bogart and young Lauren Bacall which perks things up. They make for a great couple but the movie which surrounds them lets them down somewhat. The story is just not all that interesting. So similar to Casablanca yet for whatever reason the story here just doesn't grab you the way it did back then. No romantic rival for Bogart here along the lines of the Paul Henreid character in Casablanca, that removes some tension this film could have dearly used. Could have used someone to fill a Claude Rains kind of role too. This movie is so focused in on Bogart and Bacall. This famous couple does a fine job but they could've used a little help. They have to carry pretty much the entire weight of this film on their shoulders. Their back and forth provides some great moments. But there are not enough great moments to make this a great movie.",

            "content": "Sometimes I love \"classic\" movies because in all these years, with so many movies piling up, the sort of authority of hindsight exists upon them. They might have been popular at the time, but now they are gems. And other times there's just a joy in the general style and feeling of those times -- the great jazz musicians, the lingo, the styles, all of that -- which makes movies from the 30s and 40s really special because they show off the fantastic popular culture of the time, a culture that I sometimes feel is more tasteful and intelligent than what you see in today's movies. Howard Hawks' \"To Have and Have Not\" is the best of both of those. Imagine you're in some kind of exotic bar in the middle of nowhere, and Hoagy Carmichael is the in- house pianist. Don't worry about what to say, because William Faulkner is writing the dialog. What universe are we in? Famously, this was Lauren Bacall's first movie, and the movie as such testifies to the kind of rapport that Hawks could create with his leading ladies. He was truly a \"star-maker\" if anybody was. Bacall proved a major talent throughout her career but was rarely, if ever, as exciting as she was here. I love how she and Bogart toss things back and forth between them (matches, keys, then matches again), a perfect visual metaphor for the relationship. Bogart's in top form here, his character is even more ruthless than Rick in \"Casablanca\" prior to the formulaic turnaround that he undergoes. I like some of the elements Hawks, Furthman and Faulkner added to the mix here (I'm excusing Mr. Hemmingway from the mix because my understanding is that his book was followed only in the vaguest sense), like the jealousy in the second half where the rebel guy's wife (Dolores Moran) is saying stuff to him like \"I don't think I'll be bothered by anything you ever say again.\" The script is very excellent in this film, one of the best in movie history I would even argue. It's amusing and exciting on so many levels, you can watch it in so many different states of mind. It's a continuous cat and mouse game, and then you also have these fascinating relationships like Bogart's character Steve's friendship with Walter Brennan's Eddie. Eddie is similar to the Dean Martin character in \"Rio Bravo\", he's dissipated and Steve wants to help him prove to himself that he is still a man. Brennan is a brilliant actor, every scene feels spontaneous with him. You also have people like Marcel Dalio and Dan Seymour, just these very professional and high quality actors, and of course as mentioned the legendary composer and personality Hoagy Carmichael on the keys. I just have to admit that in our household Hoagy Carmichael is basically a deity so I have no objectivity about him, but that said he's incredible in this movie. He's the mid-westerner in all of us reaching for something exotic and far away, singin' the \"Hong Kong Blues.\" It's also interesting how while he's sort of similar to Dooley Wilson in \"Casablanca\", he's more of a friend or mentor to Bacall's character while Bograt has his relationship with Brennan. It gives a lot of independence to Bacall and Carmichael, there's a real feeling that they might possibly get cut loose from the other duo at any moment. Bacall makes sure to say good-bye to \"Cricket\" before leaving the scene at the end.The thing about this movie that strikes me most of all, is the way that emotion prevails over logic at every turn, both inside the movie and in the actual composition or structure of the movie. The audience really wants Bogart and Bacall to get together because we're so excited by their play, their back and forth. They give as good as they take. They feel like glorious shadows to me, they're bigger than actual people and more well defined. Sex, writ large. Maybe censorship makes things less \"realistic\" in an objective sense. What Hawks did here with Faulkner and Furthman, both master writers, was to create a style of dialog that was more realistic than reality if you follow my meaning. Like dream dialogue, and more real to us in the same way that dreams are more real or true than waking life.Only a few trifles drag the film down slightly... the obligatory hero-martyr figures are played up a bit too heavy and don't have the substance of their equivalents in \"Casablanca\", the obvious model for this film. The benefit of losing that weight is greater freedom for the Bacall character in general because she's disassociated with the melodrama in a way that Bergman isn't in the other film, but the scenes with the rebels and the discussion of \"the Germans\" feel like they are painted with a very broad stroke. The film in general is very broad and could be criticized along those lines although as I think you can gather, I feel that would be missing the point. This is a great film despite whatever of those things you might argue are flaws, because it features a male and female protagonist who go through a very convincing form of courtship through this film, a courtship that defies the obvious even while it fulfills the intimate needs of the audience. This film was a model for many films in its wake. Bogart is able to maintain his hard boiled image because Hawks has created a woman who is convincingly modern to accompany him on his dark voyage.",

A young Hoagy Carmichael plays the Sam pianist role. I have always wanted to see him on film.The creepy, greasy police chief, played by Dan Seymour, is much more interesting in this film with his strange accent than his Casablanca counterpart.Bacall in her first film appearance knocks your socks off with her commanding confidence (and her 1940s fashions with Romulan shoulder pads worthy of Reggie Bush.) The screen crackles when she is on, though I felt embarrassed when she sang. Bergman is a little too feeble I thought for the heroine in Casablanca. Bogie plays a similar romantic lead role with similar coldness.The film has been underrated because it is so similar to Casablanca. But that does not mean it is not an entertaining option to watching Casablanca yet again. I found the romantic scenes grabbed my attention here, where they put me to sleep in Casablanca as too melodramatic and unbelievable.This is Bacall's first film. It is unbelievable the way she tackles the role with such gusto, nothing tentative about this at all. When this film hit the theatres, it much have made audience suck in the their breath.

This is largely due to the sizzling looks exchanged between Bogart (at first amused by the girl) and Bacall (who can do more with a single line of dialog and a certain \"look\" than anyone else I can think of).But, unfortunately, not everything else is up to the level of standards set by Bogey and Bacall. The script is really a trifling story that has been told before and since with much more energy and a stronger cast of supporting characters.WALTER BRENNAN as a forgetful alcoholic becomes a bore after his third scene with Bogart--although his depiction of an alcoholic is a pretty accurate one. He's supposed to be the comedy relief for a story about a man who owns a fishing boat (Bogart) and the dangerous world he lives in where the Vichy French are causing problems (a la \"Casablanca\").LAUREN BACALL just happens to land in Martinique in the midst of all this intrigue and soon finds herself in love with HUMPHREY BOGART, who seems to be playing Rick from \"Casablanca\" all over again.Both of them have a way with lines that saves the film from being less than impressive. Howard Hawks certainly knew how to coach Bacall to get a decent performance from her, since she was only nineteen and had only done some modeling before her screen career took off.Sheldon Leonard is wasted in a nothing role and Dan Seymour overdoes the French accent to an irritating degree. Dolores Moran is a beauty who never went on to major roles despite her striking good looks, as a woman who owes a lot to Bogey when he takes care of her husband's gunshot wound. Bogey is so efficient here--a handy man to have around, he seems to know how to do everything.Summing up: Based loosely on an Ernest Hemingway story, it gets a boost from the star chemistry between the Bogarts.",

I was composing rock and roll tunes, a few of which were published by Southern Music Publishing Company, Peer International in the NYC Brill Building {Tin Pan Alley]. I had brought in a 7\" reel of tunes I had composed, had been heard by a local disc jockey who then set up the appointment for me. As the A&R man was listening in a sound proof booth, I decided to go wandering to look at all the gold records on the wall. I stopped upon hearing the tinkling of a piano coming from behind a closed door.I opened it and walked in. There at the piano sat a skinny guy at a piano, He had a cigarette dangling from his lips. Being a hot shot, I told him how famous a composer I was going to be and asked if he had ever written anything noteworthy. He said yes and started playing something that sounded less than noteworthy. And I told him so. He replied, \"That's just the intro kid---here's the song.\" It was \"STARDUST\" and the man at the piano was Hoagy Carmichael.I was embarrassed and told him so. As he continued playing that monumental tune, his words to me were, \"Get outta music, kid. It'll break your heart.\" I did eventually because he was right.And there he sat as \"Cricket\" tickling the ivories in \"To Have and Have Not.\" Yes indeed, it was the man I met about twelve years later. That in itself caused me to like the film. Was it a great story? No. Bogart, like in \"Casablanca,\" the best American film ever made, was again cynical who refused to stick his neck out for anyone. He wanted nothing to do with either France's Vichy government or the Free French who hated it. His boat was for fishing only and to heck with politics. But in time he got patriotic thanks to lack of money...I can put it no other way.The love affair and marriage of Bogart and Bette Perskey a.k.a Lauren Bacall is the stuff legends are made of. Sounds like a line from \"The Maltese Falcon\" doesn't it? I think Bacall was 19 and Bogart 44 when this film was made and the very apparent real life sensuality and seduction were palpable. How could Bogart distance himself from any gal who instructed him on how to whistle? \"Just put your two lips together and blow.\" One of the best remembered sentences from any movie.And of course we know how fond Bogart was of sailing. I wonder if the boat in the film was his \"Santana?\" It makes no difference but nonetheless it was obvious how much he loved the sea. I can think of no people other than Bogart and Bacall to make Hemingway's novel come to life.This picture was perfect for a true blue nostalgiaphile but not for anyone who's interested only in plots, acting and so forth and so on. It's an entertaining and interesting look at the union of Hollywood legends because there'll never be a couple like B & B. They caused that celluloid to smoulder.",

            "content": "They knew how to make a movie, didn't they? Just gather a bunch of talented people and film. And that's what they did here. Since I've never read Ernest Hemingway's novel - to which the movie apparently bears little resemblance - that probably made the movie easier to enjoy. I haven't seen many of Howard Hawks's movies, but the ones that I have seen (\"Bringing Up Baby\", \"To Have and Have Not\", \"The Big Sleep\") I've really liked.The movie casts Humphrey Bogart as American sailor Harry Morgan, living on the Caribbean island of Martinique during WWII. He rents his boat to people so they can go fishing. Not surprisingly, the war has severely cut business. Harry hopes to remain neutral in the war. But when some French resistance fighters come to the island, Harry realizes that neutrality is not a sustainable option. This is compounded with the arrival of sexy singer Marie Browning (Lauren Bacall).The famous line about whistling is barely the tip of the iceberg. Throughout the whole movie, Lauren Bacall exudes sexuality without even trying (I try to imagine watching the movie when it first got released, what it would have been like to hear some of the dialog). As Bogey plays his usual tough guy role, it's a pleasure not just to see him act the role out, but also to anticipate what's coming. I will say that Walter Brennan, as Harry's oft besotted friend, actually seems a little bit out of place in this sort of movie; a little humor's OK, but it got a little silly.All in all, Howard Hawks directed a real masterpiece here. It actually seems like a link between some of Bogey's other movies. He plays an American expatriate, like in \"Casablanca\"; he owns a boat, like in \"The African Queen\"; and the setting is the tropical part of the western hemisphere, like in \"Key Largo\". But that doesn't drag the movie down at all. Really good. Also starring Hoagy Carmichael and Sheldon Leonard (who later produced \"The Danny Thomas Show\", \"The Andy Griffith Show\" and \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\").PS: the DVD includes a Merrie Melodies cartoon called \"Bacall to Arms\", portraying various misfits watching \"To Have...To Have...To Have\" starring Bogey Gocart and Laurie Bee Cool.PPS: a Far Side cartoon portrayed \"Classic Snake Films\", in which a sultry female snake says \"You know how to kill a rat, don't you? Just put your coils together and squeeze.\"",

Like the previous year's more famous film, it has the elements of a cinematic great. Excellent cast, witty dialogue and sharp direction by the multi talented director Howard Hawks (\"Bringing Up Baby\", \"Only Angels Have Wings\", \"His Girl Friday\", \"The Big Sleep\") make this a wonderful movie going experience.I cannot judge Ernest Hemmingway's novel as I have never read the book. The screenplay successfully combined elements of suspense, romance, wit and drama. Bogie was great in another cynical, tough guy role, although a routine facade for his days at Warner. Walter Huston gives a funny performance as his alcoholic consumed friend Eddie and Lauren Bacall, in her memorable debut performance as \"Slim\" pairs off with Bogie extremely well.\nPossibly one of the best thrillers of the 1940s.

            "content": "Or \"Marlowe At Sea\". Yet another ridiculously overrated old film with Bogey. Quite talky, too. Bogey basically plays the same character as in the Marlow films; always in control of a situation, never nervous - no matter how dangerous a situation, calls women \"slim\" and \"dames\" and other such nonsense, is the only \"real male\" i.e. alpha male in the movie (the only other alpha male male being the head of Gestapo - but he is only a fat alpha male male), and - naturally - every attractive young woman who comes his way cannot resist his charms and wants his penis within hours of their initial introduction. The character clich\u00e9s are all here. Bogey is supposed to be the same type of cynic-about-to-reform as in \"Casablanca\", and naturally he often refuses money or other valuables when being offered them - but how does that fit in with the tough cynic in him? It doesn't, so he can't be a cynic; Hawks wanted it both ways: a character who is both the \"cool lone cynic\" and yet a well-meaning humanitarian. I don't think so... Bacall does her non-chalant \"cool babe\" routine for the first time, and there are plenty of overrated, not all-too interesting so-called \"sexual innuendo\" exchanges between her and Bogey; these dialogues sound silly by today's standards. \"Just purse your lips and whistle...\". A load of crap... She was 19 when this was made but looks a lot older, and is far less attractive than the female stars of the day. Her bony face, with its sharp features, is nowhere even close to radiating the kind of feminine beauty of a de Havilland, the cuteness of a Myrna Loy, let alone the likability of an Irene Dunne. Bacall was more suited for playing vampires, not femme-fatales. (In real life she is very much like her face: a Hollywood bitch.) There is a scene in which Bacall breaks into tears; very unsuitable for her character. There are two or three bad musical numbers - but my fast-forward button was ready.If you're interested in reading my \"biographies\" of Bogart, Bacall, Huston, and other Hollywood personalities, contact me by e-mail.",

A real surprise was Hoagy Carmichael in the Dooley Wilson role from \"Casablanca\" as the bar room piano player. The big draw however, was Lauren Bacall. In her signature way she is\npossessed with a smoking sensuality, perhaps never more than in this film, but is also curiously wholesome. And the final scene where she does the little hip shimmy as she exits the screen is an iconic movie moment. And yet in the original screenplay Bogart's character has an affair with the wife of the Free French rebel.\nIt's funny how things turn out. This would probably be a 7/10 film without Bacall.

            "content": "I never read the Ernest Hemingway book that To Have and Have Not is based off of, but maybe the little genius in this film is that it didn't need to rely on it, if at all. Two of the screenwriters (one already an as-notorious author as Hemingway in Faulkner) who went on to scribe the pretzel-factory of twists in Chandler's the Big Sleep were able to extract what was probably necessary such as character traits and some hints of story incidents and expand it into something Howard Hawks could work with. This has his classic wry humor and moments of interspersed drama, and in its own way ranks alongside the other film that is of course its immediately made counterpart- Casablanca- for having Hollywood stars with immediate, crisp on-screen chemistry. It's not unfathomable to think if one did not know how close Bogart and Bacall were off-screen that they might be. Their scenes are of course some of the most magnetic in the film, supplying for its audience that short-lived but potent combination of equal parts iconic, well-rounded machismo and sultry, confident femininity of the grandest escapist type. Their scenes together are always the sweetest, with the most chances for bits of dialog one could only wish would show up on romantic films like these.But To Have and Have Not would just be of good, curious interest for its stars *together* on screen if the story didn't work. Very likely the 'three good scenes, no bad ones' policy Hawks used with his film-making is pulled off here, and the three particularly stand-out ones will vary from viewer to viewer. I personally loved the scene with the shoot-out as the first turning point, where after the action goes by quick the piano player named Cricket chimes in with two different, amusing sets of music cues (in general his character is a nice little addition to the stock of character actors floating about). There is also likely one of these good scenes among those of Bogie's old, drinking companion played by Walter Brennan, who isn't as laugh-out-loud funny as he is of the, to put it one way, 'chuckle' kind, bringing a genuinely good supporting role to the film. And possibly one of the other 'good' scenes comes towards the end, as some of the Casablanca vibe gets amplified \"get on a plane\" thing going on.Even in little moments when one comes to the startling realization that the film is in fact more dated than it should be, To Have and Have Not is a delight of an adventurous Bogie and young, half/worried half/intuitive Bacall in her debut (one of the best from any American actress by far). And the storytelling by Hawks is another reminder to me that I've only scratched the surface of his career.",

It however also is a bit of a slow and dragging movie in parts, especially for todays standards of course. With a little bit more of tension, action and a tad bit of humor/entertainment this movie could had really been a \"Casablanca 2\".A thing most '40's movies have in common is that they start of slow and quite uninteresting as well but after about the halve way point the movie becomes suddenly so much better and at its peak reaches the level of brilliance. \"To Have and Have Not\" might perhaps never truly reach the level of brilliance but it is a movie that has touches of greatness to it.Of course this movie is often being compared to \"Casablanca\". Not only because the both have Humphrey Bogart in the main lead but also the story and settings most definitely show similarities.It's not necessarily the story that makes this movie great but more its dialog and handling of it by the director and actors. No it really is not Howard Hawks' best movie but for movie lovers and the fans of the genre and '40's movie-era this movie simply still is a great watch.The movie is being carried by its main lead Humphrey Bogart who was always perfect in a role such as this one. He also meets his match in Lauren Bacall this time, who perhaps is being even tougher than him in this movie this time. It was the first time the two actors teamed up and it actually was Bacall's movie debut. She and Bogart also married one year later, after meeting during the filming of this movie. They played together in several movies during their marriage, that lasted till Bogart's early death in 1957.

            "content": "All Harry \"Steve\" Morgan wants to do is to take Martinique vacationers and tourists deep-sea fishing. The year is 1940, and the expatriate American has his world jolted when the first waves of World War II reach the Caribbean. Martinique is a French colony and France has just fallen to the Germans. The Vichy government is now in charge. This makes for an interesting movie from here on, and \"To Have and Have Not\" is similar, as many others have noted, to \"Casablanca\" of 1942. The story is supposed to be based on a 1937 Ernest Hemingway novel by the same title. And, Warner Brothers touted it as such in the credits and the build up to the movie. But, about the only things that resemble the original novel are the names of some characters, and the fact that they are in the Caribbean. A featurette short on my DVD gives some interesting background on the making of this movie. \"A Love Story: The Story of 'To Have and Have Not',\" tells of the real romance that begins in this film between Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. But it also tells of the difficulties with the film and how it wound up so different from the novel. Apparently, director Howard Hawks boasted that he could make a movie out of the worst thing Hemingway ever wrote. \"What's that?\" Hemingway asked. Hawks replied, \"That bunch of junk, 'To Have and Have Not.'\"I read the story, which took place during the depression years of the 1930s. Harry got into running rum, guns and illegal aliens. The setting was completely different \u2013 between Florida and Cuba. This movie was made in 1944 and the government had a good neighbor policy with nations of the Caribbean, so nothing could shine a negative spotlight on Cuba. The short featurette explains that in more detail. And, since WWII was underway, it made for a logical tie-in. So, Howard Hawks brought in William Faulkner who completely revised the Hemingway plot, the setting and many characters. So, this turns out to be a sort of \"Casablanca\" of the Caribbean. Bogart plays Steve Morgan who owns and operates a fishing boat for hire. He takes an old sot with him, an old timer who helped him once in the past. Now Steve looks after Eddie (played by Walter Brennan), and gives him just enough money to keep him from getting the DTs. Rick's \u0085 er, Steve's love interest in this film isn't an old flame as in the Mediterranean \"Casablanca,\" but a new young, sultry gal named Marie Browning. Steve immediately tags her as \"Slim.\" It was Lauren Bacall's film debut, as a co-star, and her star rose thereafter. Rare indeed is the performer who has had a first role with a major lead that catapulted her or him to stardom; but Bacall got it in this film. The featurette special explained that Hawks had brought her to Hollywood after he discovered her modeling. Apparently, he was taken with her and became upset when she and Bogart began to click. At the time, Bogart was in a tumultuous marriage to Mayo Methot. She was sinking deeper in her alcoholism and they fought often. Hollywood lore of the time referred to them as the battling Bogarts. A couple more comparisons with the 1942 \"Casablanca\" seem appropriate. Dooley Wilson played Sam in the first film. He sat at the piano, played and sang. In \"To Have and Have Not,\" Hoagy Carmichael does the piano and singing honors as Cricket. Conrad Veidt was the nasty Nazi, Major Heinrich Strasser in the 1942 film. In this film, Dan Seymour plays the unsavory Vichy Captain M. Renard. In \"Casablanca,\" Rick (Bogart) helped French expatriate Victor Laszlo (played by Paul Henreid) escape the clutches of the Nazis. Here, Steve helps French expatriate Paul de Bursac (played by Walter Szurovy, aka Walter Molnar) avoid the clutches of the Nazis. All of these characters and some more are superb in their roles in this film. Among the others is Dolores Moran as Hellene de Bursac. Marcel Dalio plays Frenchy, and Sheldon Leonard plays Lt. Coyo. This is an excellent, entertaining film with a good mix of drama, a little intrigue, some action, romance, war and wartime underground. Oh, yes, and just the right amount of witty and clever lines. Only here, they mostly are between Slim and Steve, where in the first film they mostly are between Rick and Capt. Louis Renault (Claude Rains). The first film was shot in three Arizona locations, a California airport, and on several Warner Brothers stages. But this one was shot completely on two WB stages in Burbank, California. Yet the harbor, street, sea and caf\u00e9 scenes seemed as real as could be. That's a fine testimonial to the quality of the major studio productions of the past.The best line in the movie belongs to Bacall. Slim says, \"I'm hard to get, Steve. All you have to do is ask.\"",

Familiar elements of wartime dramas are here: Axis plots, the French Resistance, and Bogart out to win the war single-handed as he had in Sahara. The Warner Brother's back-lot stands in for exotic Martinique, but the black and white cinematography is so good the viewer does not mind much. It's a fun cotton candy movie, that boasts crackling dialogue, in part contributed by literary luminary William Faulkner and director Howard Hawks as well. When it is over it's hard to remember what actually happened, but the smouldering image of Bogart getting hot for young Bacall lingers, along with Bacall's famous 'look', in which she holds her chin and eyes down at first, and then the eyes come up. It's devastatingly sexy, and the story goes that Bacall did this simply out of nervousness, as this was her first picture, but it played so well on film that it became the character's trademark.",

Yet he accepts to help a French Resistance agent and his wife, officially for money.. but we understand he's good at being noble. Rich in witty dialogs and featuring a colorful supporting cast including Marcel Dalio, Dan Seymour and a sympathetic pianist, it's one of the greatest love stories ever BUT it's not \"Casablanca\": we're in Fort-de-France, Martinique, Bogart is Harry Morgan, a fishing-boat Captain, Dalio is the hotel owner, at the piano, it's Cricket, not Sam and no love triangle but a real romance, real underlined.This is Howard Hawks' \"To Have and Have Not\" adapted by Prize-Nobel winner William Faulkner from a novel written by no-less Nobel Prize winner Ernest Hemingway, and despite that pedigree, whether you call it a rip-off, a remake or a coincidence, there's nothing that the film 'has' and its glorious predecessor 'has not'\u0085 except for one element, one thing it'll always have, the sensual, dazzling and irreplaceable Lauren Bacall. And after her recent passing, movies like \"To Have and Have Not\" are important to show how naturally born for gracing the silver screen, at the precocious age of 20 (looking 25), she was. Bacall had the stuff legends are made on.\"The Maltese Falcon\" and \"Casablanca\" established Humphrey Bogart's stardom with his trademark macho persona: a lone ranger, cynical yet not dishonest, strong yet not invulnerable\u0085 in the heart-department anyway. And while it's Bacall who asks him for a match all through the film, she's the first actress to ignite a burning \u2013and inextinguishable- fire of desire in his heart, ironically, he's the one who found his match. According to Hawks, a woman tailor-made for Bogie had to be as insolent and indomitable as him. Bacall, covering her nervously shaking hand under her armpit, with a cigarette and a sensual gaze and sharp lines delivered with that unique husky voice, invented the perfect attitude that would conquer the hardened heart of good old Bogie.\"Who was that girl... who left you with such a high opinion on women\", about kissing him, \"I've been wondering if I'd like it\" Naturally, she needed another kiss to make up her mind. Bacall leads the show, while Bogart reacts and hesitates but she resists his attempts of feigning reluctance. Her feelings implode with her signature line \"You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and blow\", to understand this metaphor so delightfully enrobed of sexual innuendo, remember what she says before \"You don't have to act with me, Steve. You don't have to say anything, and you don't have to do anything. Not a thing. Oh, maybe just whistle.\"In other words, don't put an act, just show, like she says \"I'm hard to get, all you need to do is ask\". No mystery here, the whistle is the core of a relationship that would end with Bacall putting a whistle in Bogart's coffin. That whistle that started it all, not Cupid and his arrow, but two nicknames, 'me Steve, you Slim' for enduring romances are always cemented by complicity. Bogart, a Last Century man, was married, straight-laced in infidelity matters and was twice the age of Bacall, but what Bacall had, his wife had not, and \"To Have and to Have Not\"'s merit is to showcase the growth of a real romance, it's not Slim and Steve but Bogie and Baby, and again, it shows in the film.As critic Leonard Maltin said, actors used to play characters loving each other, but this might be the first time where actors don't have to act, and the more restrained they are according to their 'attitudes', the more obvious the love is. And what a delight to see love in live. Indeed, there are moments in the film, where Bacall looks like a gal having the time of her life, look at her when she's waving the fumes of chloroforms away clearly in the direction of her passed out rival, Dolores De Moran, with that 'ain't I a stinker?' Bugs Bunny look, Actually, Moran's Ilsa-like role had to be shortened because she couldn't possibly rival with Bacall, no one would believe it.De Moran ended up having an affair with Hawks, who envied Bogart for taking Baby away. It still cost Bogie his marriage but what a small price to pay for legend. As for the film, it's liable to be seen as a B-version of \"Casablanca\", adapted from what Hawks considered Hemingway's worst (a story originally set in Cuba but changed for political reasons and to fit the context of the war), but if there's no Claude Rains, there's the greatest character actor Walter Brennan who steals the show as Eddie, the brave rummy sidekick who, asking either for money for a drink, or if \"you was ever been hit by a dead bee\". is the second highlight of the film far behind Bacall, whose chemistry with Bogie redeemed every minor flaw.As Howard Hawks said, a good movie should 'have' three good scenes and 'have not' a bad one. Let's start the count, no bad scene, the 'whistle' line followed by Bogart's practice and his genuine smile, that other defining moment when in the darkness of a hotel room, he realizes Slim's insecurity, leans over her, gently lifts her chin, and kisses her, as we witness the genesis of a real love story. And there's that ending when Cricket asks Slim if she's happy, her off-character little hip dance perfectly captures that mix of glamor and naughty innocence, Bogart grabs her like saying 'stop fooling around, kid, you're mine, now'. Indeed, she'd never leave that arm, not with that gorgeous smile, of an enamored 20-year old girl\u0085 and Brennan handing the bags follows them, concluding the film with the perfect little pirouette.She's happy, we're happy... and they lived happily ever after.",

            "content": "A great director such as Howard Hawks directing. Humphrey Bogart, deservedly a screen icon, in the male lead role. Lauren Bacall in her film debut, which signalled the start of a legendary teaming. That it was based on an Ernest Hemmingway novel, and one of his most difficult to adapt ones as well. The comparisons to 'Casablanca', one of my all time favourite films, were enough to make me want to see it. Being a big fan of film, of all decades and genres, of the \"golden age\" and overall.Was not disappointed in any shape or form. Not as great as 'Casablanca', but would have been a tall order, and as an adaptation of Hemmingway it is not exactly faithful to put it mildly, though the novel is far from Hemmingway at his best. On its own merits though 'To Have and Have Not' was a joy to watch and a must for Bogart and Bacall fans individually and also if one loves them together, as 'To Have and Have Not' is one of the quintessentials of theirs. This may cause uproar, but to me this is a rare case of the film being better than the source material.The studio backlot sets are not exactly refined, though at the same time they were far from amateurish. The photography is truly gorgeous and more than makes up for them.And it could have gotten going a little quicker, though mostly the pacing was fine and the cast and script carry it along brilliantly.Hawks' directing is accomplished and sharp and he doesn't make it go over-the-top. One never gets either the sense that he was slumming it, and highly doubt in real life he was. While not quite one of the the all-time great screen performances (his Rick Blaine in 'Casablanca' does fit under that distinction though), Bogart still gives a performance that is among his best with it playing to his strengths as an actor. Bacall absolutely smoulders in her film debut and it is hard to believe actually it was her first film, few actresses before or since epitomised sultriness as much as she. Her chemistry with Bogart signalled the start of one of cinema's most legendary pairings, on and off (very like Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy), and just crackles here on screen.Support is marvellous, especially from Walter Brennan, very funny and loveable and there is a very good reason as to why he was a Hawks favourite and was a scene stealer whenever he worked with him. Hoagy Carmichael also adds a lot. Another big star, as indicated earlier on, is the script, which is full of a wonderful wit and edge. With some of the lines being very quotable and going down in history, especially the \"do you know how to whistle...\" (the quintessential Bacall line perhaps). The score is as lush as one expects from Franz Waxman without being overdone. The story is slight and fairly standard but the wit, emotion and dark tension ensures that it is seldom dull, a big highlight being Bacall's singing in a scene with Carmichael.In conclusion, great and a must watch. Bogart and Bacall went on to do even better later but as one can tell that is hardly knocking them and their chemistry here, a long way from it. 9/10",

That's how many I have, a fact held in common with most of the viewing audience for TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT. By golly, look at that, IT SAYS \"TO HAVE NOT\" right in the title! People who have never read the novel probably come out of this movie scratching their heads, and asking themselves \"To have not what?\" Hemingway aficionados who treasure him as the patron saint of the \"missing in action\" set, what with THE SUN ALSO RISES (a.k.a., Jake's Angry Inch) will come out shouting over the fact that director Howard Hawks mocks Hemingway by red-lining out the prosthetics budget required by this story's protagonist. It's as if someone filmed a version Cyrano in which the title character HAS A SNUB NOSE. Come on, Howard, the public wants to see Hemingway's \"Flipper\" in action!

I appreciate that doesn't sound flattering, but when Bogart and Bacall are together that's when the magic happens.Bogart and Bacall have chemistry like few other I have seen in Hollywood movies. It's all in the way they look at each other and speak to each other like two people in the midst of love at first sight. Bogart mostly holds all my attention in his movies, but Bacall has a presence that not only competes with his charisma but actually steals the attention from him. There were and are very few actresses who can do what Bacall did with facial expressions and when she combines her look with a smile, dialogue or a hip-swinging walk in time with some music, she's quite magnetic.Putting them both together in a movie with a tried and tested formula and a number of cliches of course doesn't feel even remotely original, but it is highly entertaining and you feel like you are watching classic Hollywood pop-corn entertainment, with elements of noir, romance, musicals, war and action that is well acted, well-filmed and well directed.Walter Brennan is the strongest of the remaining cast and he provides his unique personality to the role of Eddie. Other actors feel like they are replacements for people like Greenstreet, Lorre but do a good job supporting the main stars.For me this is an 8.5/10, but as always on IMDB I am rounding upwards.",

            "content": "\"To Have And Have Not\" was the first film to pair Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, and would be notable for that alone.  But beyond its significance in film history, it is a thoroughly enjoyable viewing experience.  Although the plot is not as tight, or perhaps as complex, as in many Bogart films, the fine cast and the atmosphere created by Howard Hawks make watching the movie very similar to spending a couple of hours with some good friends.Not only does the Bogart/Bacall pairing click from the beginning, but we also have Walter Brennan, Hoagy Carmichael and his piano, and good character actors like Marcel Dalio and Dan Seymour.  It's great company to be with, no matter what they end up doing.The story is fairly simple, and was adapted from - though not very similar to - one portion of a novel by Ernest Hemingway.  Bogart is Harry Morgan, captain of a fishing boat on the island of Martinique during World War II, who is asked to use his boat to help the Free French against the island's Vichy government.  There are some very exciting sequences as the cynical captain gets more and more involved.  Because we quickly come to care about the characters, we want very much to see them safe and to see them succeed in what they are trying to do.Howard Hawks was a director who was very responsive to his actors and material, and in \"To Have and Have Not\" he has blended together characters, plot, and setting into a movie that all fans of classic cinema will want to see.",

            "review_title": "Poor Man's Casablanca proves to be one of the most overrated films in cinematic history",
            "content": "Based on the Ernest Hemingway novel of the same name, To Have and Have Not was considered by Hemingway to be his worst novel. Twenty percent of the plot was used from the original narrative, pieced together by screenwriters Jules Fuhrman and luminary novelist William Faulkner. We should have expected something a lot better from Faulkner as this film may be one of the ten most overrated films in cinematic history.\nTo Have and Have Not is so much a poor man's Casablanca. Both films feature French colonies run by the collaborationist pro-German Vichy government (here's it's Martinique in the Caribbean). Bogart is a world weary American, Harry Morgan (owner of a small fishing boat) who is extremely reluctant to get involved in the political conflict overwhelming the free world. And just like in Casablanca, there's a Resistance Leader Paul de Bursac (Walter Surovy) along with his wife, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne (Dolores Moran), whom Harry must end up assisting. But unlike in Casablanca, Harry's love interest whom he calls Slim (Lauren Bacall) is a lone operator and never in love with the resistance leader. Much of the action in both films takes place in a bar/nightclub and there is even a piano player who occasionally offers up a forgettable tune or two.\nMuch of the film focuses on the relationship between Bogart and Bacall, who ended up marrying a year after the picture was made. The dialogue between them is fraught with sexual innuendo but who cares-their machinations do little to advance the plot. While Bogart was about 45 when the film was made, he looks a lot older (and not all that healthy). Bacall was 18 years old, playing a rootless teenager as if she were a mature adult. Her efforts at trying to be \"sultry\" and \"cool\" were much admired I guess at the time (and still are), but to me her performance is almost laughable (probably because she's unnaturally stiff and hardly seems like a real person who's only 18 years old). There is no revelation of a hint of anxiety on Bacall's part, despite the fact her life appears to be in constant danger.\nEddie (Walter Brennan) is Harry's mate on the boat but no longer respected by him due to his chronic alcoholism. It's a role that Bogart should have taken on, rather than the virile lover of an 18 year old. In fact, seven years later, Bogart was far more believable as an alcoholic boat mechanic in The African Queen. Things take an incredibly long time to get going in To Have or Have Not. We spend quite a bit of time as Harry takes his client Johnson (Walter Sande) out on a fishing expedition. Johnson promises to pay Harry the $800 or so he owes the next day, but when Slim later pilfers his wallet at the club, Harry soon discovers $1400 in traveler's checks and an airplane ticket in the wallet, indicating that Johnson had no intention of paying his debt to the intrepid boat owner.\nAt this point, Frenchie, the hotel owner, introduces members of the French Resistance to Harry, who flatly rejects their request to ferry resistance leader de Bursac to the Island. The action picks up a bit when the police attempt to gun down these guys at the club, accidentally killing Johnson, who is an innocent bystander. Harry and Slim end up being interrogated by the local police chief, Capitane Renard (Dan Seymour) who alienates Harry, confiscating his cash and allowing one of his men to slap Slim in the face. Renard is hardly a complicated police official like Captain Renault (played by Claude Raines in Casablanca), whose allegiances are not so clear cut. Aside from the cliched set of bad guys, no one in the Resistance is fleshed out either.\nEven though there's some subsequent action as Harry agrees to pick up de Bursac who is shot in the shoulder after a patrol boat encounters Harry's vessel, it soon becomes a very long-winded affair, with the beleaguered couple hiding in the nightclub basement and Harry laboriously playing doctor, removing the bullet from de Bursac's shoulder.\nTo Have and Have Not really only has one good scene: the climax where the police detain Eddie and attempt to blackmail Harry into giving up the location of the de Bursac and his wife. Harry of course turns the tables on his three captors, killing one and then ensuring that he obtains Eddie's release from Renard and his thug buddy, who are subsequently turned over to the Resistance.\nA romance that goes nowhere with miscast actors, coupled with a thinly drawn set of antagonists and a plot devoid of much suspense, To Have and Have Not is guaranteed to sadly remain merely a propaganda piece for the war effort and a film that should not be considered in anyway, part of the pantheon of ephemeral cinematic classics.",

Bacall's the beautiful drifter who walks into Bogart's heart and life with the line 'Anybody got a match?' What a terrific entrance for Lauren Bacall. That hot match would end up being hers with Bogart. She was a 19 year old. He was a 44 year old. But when you look at them up there on screen, you cease to care about age. Bacall seems so much older with her world-weary demeanour and husky voice. Bogart oozes charisma and sex appeal. This is a terrific romance-adventure story.It strongly resembles 'Casablanca', and I will dare to say that this is the more livelier of the two. I still regard 'Casablanca' as the better film, of course, yet 'To Have And Have Not' is so enjoyable because of the Bogart-Bacall teaming.I love how she moves. Apparently the famous 'Look' came about because Bacall was too nervous (her head would shake) to actually look Bogart directly in the eye. As one other reviewer has already said, she has the look of a femme fatale but the appeal of a buddy figure. She could be one of the guys, but she's certainly no tag-along butch. She's one of a kind.Gotta love the justifiably famous 'You know how to whistle scene?' Bogart appears to be just as much in awe of Bacall as we are.The always good Walter Brennan has a supporting role in this, too.A wonderful script filled with double entendres and sexy banter between the two stars, 'To Have and Have Not' is the film you SHOULD have in your film collection.",

This film will only grow more dear with time, since at its most basic it is a tale that mixes two universal, albeit disparate, facets of human existence: standing up against oppression, and nascent love.Bogart is Bogart, which is to say something to forever cherish. He is exactly what one has come to expect from most any character he played. While other actors might be criticized for playing to type, Bogart is a type that never disappoints and would be a letdown if he had ever appeared in another form. Lauren Becall makes an acceptable debut, with a few slips here and there, but despite that she has enough to carry the screen when she's on it. Don't miss her little jig at the end. Walter Brennan, as a kind of comic relief, is deceptively superb, making his character seem easier to play than it must have been. His is an underrated skill, throughout his career. There are also a few pleasant surprises, too, with Dan Seymour playing a combination of Sidney Greenstreet and Victor Buono as the unctuous and rotund, and okay maybe stereotypical Capt. Renard, Marcel Dalio (of Casablanca fame) as the saloon keeper Frenchy, and the drop dead gorgeous and oddly yet powerfully sexy Dolores Moran as Madame Hellene du Bursac. She'll make you fall in love, so be careful.Accompanying the cast and story line is the piano and magnificent melodies of the great Hoagy Carmichael, who adds fun pieces (Hong Kong Blues, Am I Blue) and timeless pieces such as How Little We Know. Yes, his voice is not the best, but the delivery and his mien fit perfectly the mood of the film. His role is what helps make the whole greater than the sum of the parts.Get this on DVD or Netflix, grab a bottle of whatever makes you happy, and just sit back and enjoy. Then enjoy it all again.",

It is a fine quasi-remake of Casablanca (1942) with Humphrey Bogart playing essentially the same kind of character he played in Casablanca, a worldly wise, cynical America ex-pat who doesn't want to get involved in politics as the storm clouds of World War II gather. Instead of a saloon in Casablanca Bogie has a fishing boat in Martinique. Instead of Ingrid Bergman he has Lauren Bacall. Instead of Claude Rains as perfect of police, he has Dan Seymour as Capt. Renard working for the Germans. Instead of Dooley Wilson to play the piano and sing, he has Hoagy Carmichael. Instead of Peter Lorre as a sniveling lowlife, he has Walter Brennan as an alcoholic friend. In either case, Bogie ends up helping the Free French even though he'd rather not get involved.This was Lauren Bacall's debut. She was 22-years-old and legend has it that she and Bogart, who was in his forties, fell in love during the filming. She plays a sultry babe with a hard edge, and she does it very well. Her famous line, \"You know how to whistle, don't you Steve? You just put your lips together and blow\" more or less defined her character.I found Walter Brennan's Eddie annoying, but then I never liked lushes. Dan Seymour is memorable as the portly man with a scar who speaks with weighty precision as he works for the Vichy government. Hoagy Carmichael warbles a tune or two and Dolores Moran looks good enough to eat. Howard Hawks' direction is sharp and focused, although supposedly he was eating his heart out because Bacall preferred Bogart over him.Clearly this is all about Bogart and Bacall, probably their best work together.

Even the good supporting role played by Walter Brennan appears more as a script gimmick (the humanizing old sidekick played by Thomas Mitchell in Only Angels Have Wings).An old movie with some good scenes, nothing more.",

To make it even more memorable, Bogart was having marital problems and Hawks wanted to beef up Bacall's role to make her a star. So, the two began work almost exclusively together and perhaps the most famous Hollywood romance was born.As for the film, there really isn't that much memorable than the heated chemistry between the two leads as the shoot went on. The story is well-told with a very wicked screenplay by Jules Furthman and William Faulkner. Plenty of great one-liners (\"I'm hard to get, Steve. All you have to do is ask.\") add to the mix as well as a very fine performance by Walter Brennan, a Hawks favorite, as a forgetful but likable drunk pal of Bogart. As I mentioned before, there really isn't much to discuss except that which lasted much longer than this film. However, these three would soon collaborate again on a film much more deep and well-received. But that is for another time and place.",

But, the honest truth is, To Have And To Have Not was barely passable entertainment regardless of it starring Humphrey Bogart and its strategic position in film-making history.What also seriously influenced my lower score of this certain film was the glorification of the \"Eddie\" character who nothing but a useless, bungling drunk. I know that Eddie was being presented in the story as comic relief, but, from a modern perspective on the ways of a chronic alcoholic, I found Eddie's clueless, drunken shtick to be utterly repulsive in the worst possible way.All-in-all- This film did not come anywhere near to living up to the lofty position that it holds for itself in the realm of classic, Hollywood movie-making.",

            "content": "'To Have And Have Not' is such a mishmash, it's hard to know how to feel about it. It was 1944's entry in the 'Casablanca' wannabe series of films, and of course it's one up on all the others by virtue of starring Humphrey Bogart and being produced by Warner Bros. But the storyline and several supporting characters are vastly inferior to that 'timeless classic.' A few scenes are great, a few are adequate, and several are stupid beyond belief. What 'To Have And Have Not' really has going for it is Lauren Bacall, in her first big role. This must be the film people are referring to when they talk about a 'star-making vehicle.' Bacall steals every scene she's in, and is so good she almost makes you forget about the movie's obvious flaws, 'almost' being the operative word. Bogart is Bogart, and he manages to stand apart from the script's weaknesses for the most part by sheer force of personality. He shines most in his scenes with Bacall, but also in a few others where we see him in charge, utterly cool as always, as only Bogie can be. Three supporting characters do their best to sink the film though, in differing ways. Walter Brennan is quite believable as Eddie, the drunk sidekick, but the character is so annoying and unamusing that you find yourself wishing he would die of alcohol poisoning. The legendary composer Hoagy Carmichael portrays Cricket, the piano player, obviously intended to be another 'Sam' a la Dooley Wilson in 'Casablanca.' But whatever Carmichael's gifts as a songwriter, he's no actor and the character adds nothing to the film. And you may find yourself questioning even his musical skills, as the tunes he sings at various points are uniformly awful. Finally, there is Dan Seymour as Captain Renard, local police chief. Seymour gives an astonishingly bad performance, speaking with a ludicrous accent (what is it supposed to be? French? Hungarian?) that wouldn't convince a cow. The plot finds Bogart's character, Harry Morgan (yes, that's really his name) as a skipper-for-hire who gets drawn into helping a group of Free French smuggle one of their own onto the island of Martinique. And speaking of the character's name, Bacall calls him 'Steve' throughout the film, for reasons that are unclear to me. Some credits show his character as Harry 'Steve' Morgan. Go figure. And speaking of annoyances as we were a moment ago, poor Harry/Steve is harassed and pestered throughout the film... by Eddie, by Frenchie, by his customer Johnson, by the portmaster, by Captain Renard, by the Free French, by the guy he's hired to pick up and his annoying wife. There's hardly a scene with Bogart in it where someone doesn't bust in and want something. You finally want to reach into the screen and grab the other characters by the hair and yell, \"Leave the poor guy alone!\" To be fair, there are some exciting moments towards the end of the film; the final shot shows Brennan's Eddie, Bacall's Slim, and Bogart's Harry/Steve leaving the bar to the strains of Carmichael's piano playing, and you are reminded once again of what a mixed viewing experience 'To Have And Have Not' has been.",

But she was 19, looked 30, was not particularly attractive and had a husky, masculine voice. Reducing her role in the film (as Hawks had it originally scripted) would have been an improvement. How the 19-year old Bacall ended up with the ancient Bogart in real life, I have no idea.Interestingly, the DVD includes a Merrie Melodies cartoon called \"Bacall to Arms\" which I actually enjoyed more than the film.

            "content": "\"To Have and Have Not\" grew out of a conversation between Ernest Hemingway and Howard Hawks. Hawks had tried to persuade Hemingway to write screenplays, but Hemingway refused. Hawks told Hemingway, \"I can make a picture out of your worst story.\" Hemingway asked, \"What's my worst story?\" Hawks replied \"a bunch of junk\" called \"To Have and Have Not.\" \"You can't make anything out of that,\" Hemingway argued. Hawks retorted, \"Yes, I can.\" The novel \"To Have and Have Not\" concerned a charter boat captain, Harry Morgan, who loses the money owed to him by a client who leaves him in the lurch without paying his bill. Reluctantly, Morgan accepts money from rumrunners to ship their contraband merchandise. He gets shot-up, loses an arm, and his boat. Later, Morgan dies after he contends with bank robbers who force him to take them to safety using his boat. Hawks sold the story for a quarter interest in the movie to Warner Brothers, and in 1943 the studio cast Humphrey Bogart as the lead.Initially, when Howard Hawks began work on the film, the U.S. Government objected to the use of Cuba as the setting. They worried that audiences might confuse the political regime in the Hemingway novel with America's current ally, the Batista government running Cuba. Hawks and his good friend William Faulkner changed the setting to the French territory of Martinique. Furthermore, Faulkner advised Hawks to rewrite the politics of the movie so that it dealt with the clashing aims of Vichy France and Free France.Like Hemingway's novel, the film \"To Have and Have Not\" opens with professional skipper Harry Morgan (Humphrey Bogart) taking his client, Mr. Johnson (Walter Sande), fishing off the coast of Fort de France, Martinique. After sixteen days of bad luck, Johnson quits, lies about having no money, and tries to leave Morgan without paying his bill. When Harry discovers Johnson's lies, he confronts him and Johnson is about to sign over $825 worth of traveler's checks. During a shoot out between Vichy police and suspected Free French resistance agents, Johnson is caught in the crossfire and dies. Earlier, the Free French had tried to hire Harry to smuggle one of their members onto the island. Reluctantly, since the police have confiscated his cash and the money owed him by Johnson, Harry accepts the Free French offer. By this time, Harry has gotten involved with a beautiful but mysterious woman, Marie Browning (Lauren Bacall), only recently arrived in Martinique and short of finances herself. She had tried to steal Johnson's wallet, but Harry caught her and discovered Johnson's financial solvency.Harry and his longtime alcoholic sidekick Eddie (Walter Brennan) pick up Helene De Bursac (Dolores Moran) and her husband Paul (Walter Szurovy) but encounter a Vichy patrol boat. Harry shoots out its search light and loses the patrol boat in the fog. Unfortunately, Paul De Bursac catches a slug in his chest. Predictably, Vichy Police Captain Renard (Dan Seymour) questions our heroes at their hotel about their trip. Harry and Eddie lie that they were fishing for marlin when a German U-boat frightened them. Later, Harry digs the spent bullet out of De Bursac's chest with Marie's help. Captain Renard renews his suspicions and arrests Eddie. Later, Renard and his agents corner Harry at the hotel where he lives when he is not taking customers on fishing trips. Harry catches the dastardly Renard with his guard down, kills one of his henchmen, and then claps Renard and company in handcuffs. After slugging the police captain on the head, Harry convinces Renard to turn Eddie loose. Eddie, Marie, and Harry get De Bursac off the island to safety.\"To Have and Have Not\" deals with the usual themes that obsessed Hawks. All good Hawksian characters are professionals in the strictest sense and a later scene between Harry and Paul De Bursac establishes the quintessential characteristics of the Hawks hero. De Bursac describes the chief characteristic, \"When you meet danger, you never think of anything except how you will circumvent it. The word failure does not even exist for you . . .\" \"To Have and Have Not\" boasts some memorable dialogue, especially between Bogart and Bacall. The \"whistle\" scene is now the stuff of legends, like the horse race dialogue in their next movie \"The Big Sleep.\" Interestingly, Bogart and Bacall fell in love during filming while Bogart was still married to his alcoholic wife actress Mayo Methot. Eventually, Bogart divorced Methot and married Bacall. Walter Brennan's shtick about \"was you ever bit by a dead bee?\" is hilarious.Enough similarities exist between \"To Have and Have Not\" and \"Casablanca\" to make comparisons inevitable. Like the Bogart hero in \"Casablanca,\" necessity compels Harry to abandon his isolationist attitude and aid the Free French. Unlike \"Casablanca,\" no actual Nazi German characters appear in \"To Have and Have Not,\" but Madame De Bursac does mention them in passing. Furthermore, World War II does not play a major role in the story apart from the street shoot-out between Vichy authorities and the Free French as well as Renard's search for De Bursac. Unlike the doomed \"Casablanca\" romance between Rick and Ilsa, Marie and Harry have never met, and nobody comes between Harry and Marie. Unlike Rick, Harry owns a charter fishing boat rather than a tavern. Indeed, Paul De Bursac and his wife do resemble fugitive Czech Resistance leader Victor Laszlo, but De Bursac has come to Martinique to rescue a Free Frenchman imprisoned on Devil's Island.",

The piano player in the movie is Hoagy Carmichael, a real musician who gave up his career in real life as an attorney, to write popular music such as Star Dust\".This movie was made during WWII, and had the obligatory overtures to propaganda that made the French look like heroes. For those who forget their history, the French caved in to the Nazi's with hardly a fight. Although not everyone agreed with dividing France into the North and Paris being dominated by Hitler, the south, and its colonies remained in French control, known as the short lived Vichy government. The problem with this movie is that the sentiment of the time dates the movie. The only bad guys are pro-Vichy and terribly stereotypical. The good guys are anti-Vichy and terribly stereotypical. Bogart plays the same sort of character that he played in Casablanca. He comes across as a non-partisan American who is trying to just get along on the outskirts of the War. His anti-Nazi hatreds conflict with his personal goal to look out for himself. Of course without Bacall we viewers are lead to believe that he risks his boat and life to get her out of Martinque. For political and personal reasons, Bogart saves the anti-Nazi leader and his wife (maybe better looking than Bacall). He also pulls his alcoholic side kick played by Watler Brennan out of the hands of the Vichy police, and all ends well with the threesome leaving the island. This film is entertaining because Bogart's acting leaves us wondering whether anyone but he could have played this role so well.",

The chemistry between the two is historical. Howard Hawks knew how to let them do their thing - Bogie was known for his stubbornness and selfish thinking - and giving satisfaction to his own `needs' (for a good movie that is).Bogart fills the screen as a cynical (like Rick in Casablanca) fisherman in Martinique during the second world war who only wants to earn money.  But his cynical appearance is nothing but a cruel mask over his nice personality. This is quite clear when you notice his relationship with the nice fool Eddie (played by an enjoyable Walter Brennan) and later on in the film when he helps out fugitives to get on shore, only for the money, so he says.  All those things just made me think about Casablanca and you don't have to look far for other references, for instance the club, the piano player (although it's a white edition), etc.But the movie rises above the copycat nature when Marie 'Slim' Browning' (Lauren Bacall) enters the movie.  Gloriously looking she walks into the film and into the life of Harry 'Steve' Morgan (Humprey Bogart).  She has got `the cool' but is also very attached to her love.  Boogie's character changes a bit, bitten by her love.  Notice the little laughs of Boogie's during witty conversations between him and Slim.  This is a significant difference with Casablanca, it is a different Bogart that changes the picture and of course star director Howard Hawks (then known for hits like `Bringing Up, Baby', `Only Angels Have Wings' and `His Girl Friday')One of the strong points of the movie is the pace, which is quite fast. Thanks to the pace the movie never becomes a bore.  The story is told very fluently by Howard Hawks but this is far from his best movie, knowing that his next one would also star the magical couple (`The Big Sleep') and become a true crime classic.   `To Have And Have Not' is a very entertaining movie that became a classic thanks to Bacall and Bogart's performances.",

His performance as Eddie is truly memorable.The musician Hoagy Carmichael does a great job both with the piano and acting Cricket.Dolores Moran may have been overshadowed by Lauren Bacall but she still does give a brilliant performance as Mme.Hellene de Bursac.This is part of movie history.The dialog is something else.Something you can't find in many modern movies.\"Was you ever bit by a dead bee?\"",

The script is by Jules Furthman and William Faulkner who took the bones of a short story by Ernest Hemmingway and embellished it into something of a reprise of the great Michael Curtiz movie but keeping it sufficiently different not to be a carbon copy. (There are other versions but none of them come close).Bogart is the captain of a fishing boat in Martinique during the War helping the Free French against the Vichy Government, (ringing bells?), and Bacall is the hard-boiled dame who falls for him. It was her debut and she was never as good again. Essentially this is a studio picture par excellence. It pushes all the right buttons and even if it seems overly familiar it is still one of the most enjoyable pictures ever made.",

I have also thought that Walter Brennan must have been born old, because I have never seen him in a film that he didn't seem to be less than 60 years old. Slim was a good nickname for Bacall even though she didn't seem to like it at first. Everyone else seemed to pick up on it and she went with it.

He doesn't want to get involved in any conflict though; he just wants to get on with his life\u0085 he flat out refuses to help when members of the resistance try to employ him. All that changes though when his wealthy American client is killed before he can pay him and the police confiscate his money and his passport. Around this time he also meets another American; Marie 'Slim' Browning; a part time lounge singer and part time pickpocket who he wants to help leave the island; she however wants to stay with him. When he eventually takes the job for the resistance he has the somewhat unwelcome assistance of his friend Eddie; a man who isn't happy unless he is having a drink and thus potentially unreliable.This film is inevitably going to be compared to 'Casablanca' given that it stars Humphrey Bogart as a reluctant American in French territory during the war who gradually is forced to take sides. This is unfortunate as it inevitably suffers in comparison; 'Casablanca' is of course one of the greatest films ever made. If you can put that aside though this is rather enjoyable; Bogart is great as Capt. Morgan and Lauren Bacall does a fine job, in her first role, as Slim. Given her chemistry with Bogart it is no wonder they went on to star in more films together. Walter Brennan is good as Eddie; managing to make what could have been a clich\u00e9 drunk a sympathetic character. The story itself is fairly routine but it is well told and there are some decent enough action scenes as well as a degree of tension. After quite a bit of tension the ending seemed a little anticlimactic; almost as if the last few minutes were missing\u0085 we see the bad guys defeated and the heroes walking away but it felt like we should have at least got to see them sailing away on the boat. That is a minor complaint, and perhaps just a matter of taste, overall I found this to be enjoyable and I'm sure any fan of Bogart or Bacall will like it too.",

The rest of the cast were poorly developed and eminently forgettable stereotypes, as were the sets, especially, as another reviewer has pointed out, The Bar, supposedly an exotic locale, reeking of foreign intrigue, but it looks more lake a studio canteen at lunchtime.I give it 6 out of 10 for it's two stars.It's movies like this that makes Casablance so great.",

            "content": "Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall star in \"To Have and Have Not,\" a 1944 film directed by Howard Hawks. As others have pointed out, this is the first film for the 19-year-old Bacall, who apparently was a nervous wreck throughout the filming. But it turned out to be the beginning of a beautiful career, still going 66 years later, and the beginning of a beautiful relationship with the man who would become her husband, Humphrey Bogart. The film also stars Walter Brennan as Eddie.Bogart's not in Casablanca anymore, though this film and that one have some common features: wartime, people trying to get out, a neutral person who can help but doesn't want to, a bar, a pianist, and a beautiful woman. Now Bogie's character is Harry Morgan, and with an alcoholic friend Eddie along, he hires out his boat in Martinique for fishing trips. The war has changed things, and money is tight, however. When Harry is approached by members of the Free French to transport members of the resistance to Martinique, Harry doesn't want to stick his neck out. But he needs the money. Into the middle of all this comes a beautiful brunette, Slim Browning, a singer who works her way from port to port. The two verbally spar as they fall in love.Very good movie with top-notch acting and direction. The characterizations really help to make it work.Hoagy Carmichael is the pianist in the bar where Harry hangs out, and Bacall sings \"Am I Blue\" and part of \"How Little We Know.\" Supposedly Andy Williams claims that his voice was used, but it's Bacall's. It is possible that they recorded Williams' voice (he was 15 at the time) and decided not to use it. What Bacall lacks in vocal chops she makes up for in beauty, mystery, sex appeal, and screen presence, all of which she has in spades. She and Bogart have tremendous chemistry - well, that should be pretty obvious! Bogart does a great job as a rugged, tough, but fair guy who in spite of himself is in sympathy with the resistance, though he'll never admit it. Walter Brennan had a part like Eddie down to an art form by this time. But he doesn't play it as a stereotypical drunk. There's a sadness and loyalty about him. The striking Delores Moran plays the wife of the resistance worker.In an interview she gave some years ago, Bacall said that, had Bogart lived, she would always have been married to him. She obviously not only loved him but admired him, and cherishes his memory to this day. Thanks to Warner Brothers, we get to see them at the beginning. One of Hollywood's great couples, on and off the screen.",

The film paired up Bogart and Bacall for the first time, it was legendary magic. They both gave great performances as per usual and they always did as far as I'm concerned. They had personal nicknames for each other; 'Slim' (Bacall) and 'Steve' (Bogart).I believe that the film is most remembered for the on screen chemistry between Steve and Slim, and Slim's erotic insolence, radiated when she reminds Steve \"You know how to whistle, don't you? You just put your lips together, and blow.\" When you first see both of the characters you see them as strong individuals and quite different, but as time goes on they seem more alike. Steve is a warm and caring person at heart, but he has trouble trusting people and letting them in his life, maybe he's afraid of getting hurt,as of spending a lot of time alone without much female company. This is where Slim comes in very casually and changes this with her beauty and temperament.",

A very apolitical person, he refuses to get involved in the turmoil around him, but ends up transporting Paul de Bursac (Walter Szurovy), a key figure among the Free French. This he does for his own reasons. Walking into his life at the same time is the striking Marie Browning (a 19-year-old Lauren Bacall, in her film debut), and the sparks fly between the two of them.As others have noted long before this viewer, this bears much more of a resemblance to Bogies' earlier hit \"Casablanca\" than the Hemingway novel. It even has a similar \"piano man\" character, this time played by Hoagy Carmichael. But the film is so damn entertaining that it's unlikely that many people are going to care that much. Howard Hawks, in extremely fine form, directs all of it with a sure hand, crafting some excellent drama, atmosphere, and romance. There's also time for comedy relief from Morgans' often drunken sidekick Eddie (a lovable Walter Brennan). It's a good hook for a basically finances-driven character like Harry to end up deciding to pick a side in a political conflict.But the MAIN hook of \"To Have and Have Not\", as anybody can tell you, is to see the genesis of the real-life romance between legendary movie stars Bogie & Bacall. Their chemistry together is palpable; she makes for a very alluring presence. Her first moment on screen has her seductively asking for a match. And then, of course, there's her utterance of that classic line about whistling. You can see how a man could be entranced by her.However, Bogie & Bacall aren't the *whole* show. They're backed up by excellent supporting players like Szurovy, Dolores Moran, Sheldon Leonard, Marcel Dalio, Walter Sande, and Dan Seymour. Seymour was a particular favorite of this viewer as the pompous police captain dogging our protagonists.Overall, this is one of those film classics that any lover of cinema needs to see at least once.Eight out of 10.",

Not by a long, long shot.Having said that, the Steve 'avatar' of Humphrey Bogart is not quite distinguishable from the Rick 'avatar' of that mercurial performer, and Lauren Bacall, as 'Slim' Marie Browning does have her own distinct appeal, as different Ingrid Bergman's fragile Ilsa Lund as champagne is from caviar.On the whole, however, 'To Have And Have Not' pleases, but does not really thrill, as 'Casablanca' did. It's fine and engaging viewing, so long as it's on, but it doesn't continue to follow you thereafter. As in the case of 'Casablanca', this, too, is an 'episodic' film, revolving on a single incident, but the denouement, in this case, is not quite so memorable as it was in 'Casablanca'.I have dwelt on 'To Have And Have Not', studiedly, vis-a-vis 'Casablanca', because the atmosphere and situational setting - even the motivations of the principal characters - in the two films are unmistakably similar, and, having seen one, the sense of deja vu, when viewing the other, is unavoidable.In sum, engaging viewing while 'To Have And Have Not' certainly is, it is not a classic of cinema, as is 'Casablanca'. As a topical and situational film, there's nothing to complain - yet, at the end, one does feel a bit let down at how it all winds up.Good viewing, all in all, as a harbinger to the days of cinema now long gone by ...",

Paris has just fallen to the German army and the island's police are Vichy, Nazi collaborators. Harry Morgan is an American who runs a fishing service for tourists, when he is approached by resistance fighters who want to hire his boat. At first he refuses, but when both he and his friend Marie are questioned, intimidated and robbed by the cops, he changes his mind ...This is a modest movie, which, with its neutral-turned-anti-establishment Bogart hero is a little reminiscent of Casablanca, but for me has more interesting, typically odd Hawksian characters than its more famous cousin. Despite the brilliantly stylised dialogue, Bogart and Bacall (who famously fell in love while shooting it) are rougher, less glamorous, more real people. He is solid and dependable, and she is incredibly beguiling, giving a performance that disregards leading lady conventions; she tilts her head down, keeps her voice low, has almost no closeups and underplays the whole movie. She is both alluring and vulnerable and acts with astonishing poise and confidence, considering it was her first film and she was only nineteen at the time. In strong support are Brennan as a rummy old sot Bogart looks after, Seymour as the sleazy police captain, whose pudginess somehow adds to his air of corruption (and who talks like Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons), and renowned songwriter Carmichael as a barstool pianist. The plot is less interesting than the people, but Hawks keeps it marching along with rat-a-tat-tat dialogue and plenty of funny moments. Scripted by Jules Furthman and William Faulkner, based on a novel by Ernest Hemingway. Well-made and very entertaining, with an unmissable career-making performance by Bacall.",

But just like in \"Casablanca\", again he's being implored by a friend to help sheltering Renaissance fighters - and again, his conscience and the good heart he's hiding so well underneath his rough shell don't allow him to refuse.And again, a woman comes into his life; not from the past this time, but from the FUTURE - Bogart's OWN future. Young model Lauren Bacall, only 19 at the time, has just been given her first role; and a leading role, no less. Her cocksure ways (although she really was quite shy and very nervous about her film debut), her husky, sexy voice, her slender figure, and of course her famous 'look' from beneath (which resulted, as she herself admitted, from being so nervous during the shooting...), had immediately impressed everybody - and she also impressed Bogey, of course, who at the time was caught in a pretty unhappy marriage, and just felt that in Lauren he'd found the woman he'd always been looking for. Which turned out to be absolutely true...And so we can witness something UNIQUE here, a 'live' chapter of Hollywood history: Harry and young singer Marie get to know each other, start teasing each other, quarrel, make up, and finally fall in love with each other - and so did, behind the scenes, Bogart and Bacall. For all the millions of fans of Bogey and Bacall, this movie (the first of four they did together) is the most beautiful 'love document' imaginable - but it's also, seen 'purely' as a movie, an absolute masterpiece, a really worthy adaptation of a Hemingway novel.The entire cast is PERFECT, with a lot of amiable characters in it (like 'Frenchy' Marcel Dalio, another old acquaintance from \"Casablanca\", piano player 'Cricket' Hoagy Carmichael, and the lovable boozer 'Eddie' Walter Brennen, who thinks he has to 'take care' of the young couple...), but also some first-class Vichy regime scoundrels; the atmosphere is just as dense and suspenseful as in \"Casablanca\", only the humor is more sarcastic than cynical here - and the emotions, as we said, REAL...In any case, one of Hollywood's true, immortal Classics.",

            "content": "It's immediately tempting to compare \"To Have and Have Not\" to \"Casablanca.\" Both 1940s films follow a broody Humphrey Bogart, in a foreign land during World War II, who initially looks out for his own self-interests, until, moved by love and a sense of self-responsibility, he takes on risks to fight for something bigger than himself.To some extent this similarity may have been unavoidable. Producers demanded many changes from Hemingway's novel. Purporting a level of patriotism may have been necessary not only culturally, but financially for a movie's success during war-time, and this story format probably seemed like an effective way to display American exceptionalism on the world stage.So how does it compare to Casablanca?It's at least as quotable, with some of the suavest dialogue you're likely to ever hear on a film.For better or worse, it's less melodramatic. It feels more grounded and real, but also can't quite hit the seductive emotional highs and lows of Casablanca (not to mention the complexities of intertwined love, responsibility, and sympathy, often pitted against each other.)Still what it might lack in emotive story, it makes up for in the the most electric on-screen chemistry I've ever seen on film. Unlike Bergman in Casablanca, Bacall matches Bogart's charisma and emotional depth every step of the way, even surpassing him at times with her incredible screen-presence.For those who are not aware, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall began dating during the filming of this movie. After the film they even got married, and stayed married until Humphrey Bogart's death in 1957.In other words, when we see their juicy flirtation--their clever back-and-forth, the inside jokes, the push and pull of rebukes and compliments--we are witnessing not only two characters, but also two actors, falling in love.This is compounded by the fact that so much of the dialogue was of their own making--Bogart, Bacall, and Hawks apparently adapting the scripts from Faulkner each morning to better fit their ideas of the two characters.The end result is genuine love that couldn't be faked if you tried. When Bacall leaves the room after her famous line--\"You know you don't have to act with me, Steve. You don't have to say anything, and you don't have to do anything. Not a thing. Oh, maybe just whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and... blow\"--we see a shot of Bogart watching her go, completely enraptured, a smile of pure glee on his face and the slightest shake of his head in absolute bafflement. In short, we see him fall in love.So is it as good as Casablanca? Maybe not. But Casablanca couldn't do that.",

On the other hand, it was 19-year-old Lauren Bacall's first film, and she displays a sultriness and presence not often seen in someone so young. Bogart is also strong as the fishing boat skipper in Martinique who wants nothing to do with politics or the French resistance, but finds himself drawn into events as they unfold. He's gritty, tough, and real, and has a couple of fantastic scenes with Bacall, where their chemistry is apparent despite him being 25 years older, including the one where she so famously says to him \"You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and ... blow.\" I also liked musical performances led by Hoagy Carmichael, though Bacall's singing in the numbers she was in was pretty awkward.

This film is just such a movie for me. There are a couple of scenes between Humphrey Bogart and the very young, and very beautiful, Lauren Bacall which stand head and shoulders over the rest of the film. In addition there is a scene with Bacall signing in her remarkably alluring low voice which is only equaled by the impressive Michelle Pfeiffer-Jeff Bridges torch song scene in \"The Fabulous Baker Boys\". Even more impressive is that Lauren was not really a singer.The rest of the film is just not that interesting. It bears some resemblance to \"Casablanca\" with Bogart this time playing a ship captain helping out (against his better judgement) some French resistance leaders in the French Caribbean (obviously before the Vichy Government of France had collapsed). The Caribbean angle just didn't work for me (and it certainly wasn't filmed in the Caribbean but then, it was filmed during World War II). Originally the script called for Bogart to be interested in two women, but no woman could hold a candle to Bacall at that time and so that element of the plot doesn't convince anyone.Still, there are some scenes in this film that are not to be missed. You haven't lived till you hear Lauren say \"You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and... blow.\" The way she says that line, the way she looks... whew!",

The one element that exceeded Casablanca was the brilliant casting of Lauren Bacall as the romantic interest. Talk about smokin' hot. She is much hotter than Bergman ever was with Bogart in Casablanca. The screen sizzles with their genuine passion for each other. Although not as good a film, it certainly is better than the vast majority of films from 1944 (including the sappy Going My Way, which somehow won Best Picture).

Just imagine \"Casablanca\" with that typical happy ending and you have almost finished watching To Have and Have Not. What makes Casablanca a Masterpiece, an Iconic film and different from other mainstream films is those 5 minutes of climax. Many people believe and i too believe that Casablanca would have never became a legendary film if it had Happy Ending. Am i spoiling too much? I don't think so. What makes To Have And Have Not watchable is more burning on screen chemistry between Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall and more intense dialogues than Casablanca. The plot is very much similar besides that we have different characters and different plans this time. Just to point out, there's one character in the film called Eddie played by Walter Brennan and it is damn too awesome, you'll hardly a reason to hate him. Humphrey Bogart does what he always does, he's phenomenal in dark films and dark roles and if the character is sexy and cool then there's nothing more to ask for. What is unexpectedly pleasant here in the film is Lauren Bacall's character. She isn't innocent or dumb lover at all, she knows what to and when to do. This is something we lacked in Casablanca and most of the films where Woman characters doesn't have that swag. Howard Hawks has a very good product in hand, it is just that it came after Casablanca so people couldn't find it on that level. Seriously, who can touch Casablanca level? If you're going somewhere close to Casablanca then it must be called a big achievement. And If you're getting to see Humphrey Bogart in something similar to Casablanca with a better chemistry with a dame, better dialogues then you just can't skip it unless you are a fool.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",

I've said this elsewhere: it is possibly because no matter how fast he speaks it is always clear, he never mumbles, and it sounds as if he's just thought of his lines himself. His actions are consistently brisk. It's amusing to see him pretending to be a doctor. However, this film just seems pointless. A great deal of time is enigmatically wasted on Bogart's tediously boring drunk and unfunny buddy. People come and go a great deal. The bad guys are truly ridiculous, and although one or two people get shot, there's nothing even slightly dangerous, menacing or exciting about them. They are just ludicrous. How come Bogart keeps a loaded revolver and manacles in his desk drawer ? Hoagy Carmichael has produced some truly great songs in his career. Not here, however, where his performances are simply soporific.Finally we get to the sensational discovery, Lauren Bacall. Well, she's slim here, but somehow I just don't go for her, and Bogart is welcome. I guess she knew where her bread was buttered. It was staggering to learn that her whistle quote is ranked #34 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes list. The fact is that the quote is a blatant rip-off, first from the well-known ghost story by M.R.James, and secondly from his own rip-off of an even more well-known poem by Rabbie Burns.

I always felt that Casablanca was overrated and thought this infatuation with bogart was a fase. With exception of the John Huston Movies, him being such a strong human/director and all.

            "content": "Is this a remake of Casablanca? No, but it sure does share a whole lot with Michael Curtiz's film. Humphrey Bogart is a cynical American in Vichy occupied territory who has to eventually take a side in the fight all around him through an unassuming French underground fighter known to the local authorities with a woman prominently involved. It even has a similar end where Bogart chooses his side, though I feel this story, based on the novel by Ernest Hemingway, is more obviously political in nature. This feels more like a direct call to action to fight the Nazis. Oh, it's also the movie where Bogart met Lauren Bacall, one of the most famous love stories in Hollywood.Bogart plays Steve Morgan, the owner of a fishing vessel based in the Florida Keys but docked in Martinique during Vichy rule. He's at the tail end of a two-week charter from an American businessman who's spent over $800 trying and failing to catch any fish. The last night that this client is in town, with a promise to go to the bank for the money in the morning, Steve is approached by the owner of the hotel he is staying at, a Free French sympathizer, who tells him that some Free French operatives are doing to come to see Steve about chartering his boat. Steve wants nothing to do with it, brushing them off when the arrive. He also meets the new tenant across the hall, Lauren Bacall's Marie whom Steve gets to calling Slim. She steals Steve's client's wallet, which Steve catches. He's torn about whether to give her up considering that the wallet is filled with cash and traveler's checks as well as a plane ticket for the next morning before the bank opens. When Steve confronts his client about it, he's about to receive the signed over checks when the Vichy police descend on the hotel and start a shootout with the Free French representatives, leading to the client's death before he could sign over anything, and Steve is stuck in Martinique.My one real problem with this movie is that it becomes kind of aimless for a while here. Steve can't get out of Martinique because he not only lost the payment but his own cash reserves to the corrupt police captain Renard. He's got Slim hanging around with no money either, and Steve has to manage his rummy copilot Eddie. It takes a surprising amount of time for Steve to decide to do what the Free French want him to do solely for the money. Most of that time is spent on the budding relationship between Steve and Slim. The chemistry between the two is undeniable, and it's obvious that Hawks was in a certain kind of heaven as he directed two actors who could play off of each other so well. Bogart and Bacall fell in love while making this movie and married shortly afterwards, of course, and Hawks enjoyed letting them act together in roles fit for each other. I kind of feel like it goes on for a little too long, derailing the film for a bit. Also, the focus on Bacall feels like a distraction after a while, especially when she starts singing. Her character overall has an important part to play in Steve's life, especially as a mirror to another character later, but the focus on her and her relationship with Steve ends up feeling like indulgence rather than storytelling after a certain point.So, Steve takes the job which is to go to another small island and pick up two passengers to bring back to Martinique. He has no idea who they are, but he has a name and that's good enough. Eddie sneaks aboard, and Steve has no choice but to allow him to help. The man they pick up, Paul de Bursac, and his wife, Helene, offer up an interesting comparison to Steven and Slim. Paul is a freedom fighter with the mission to free some prisoners from Devil's Island, and the Resistance sent his wife along so that she couldn't get captured by Nazi or Vichy forces in France. She's not there to help him materially in his mission, but she is there to help him emotionally, providing a bedrock from which Paul can operate with a clear head instead of worrying about the safety of his wife way back in France. When Paul gets injured as Steve and Eddie escape a patrol boat, shot in the shoulder, he has to convalesce under the hotel for several days until he's healthy enough to move again. In that time Steve and Helene get to know each other.That Steve already has a romantic interest, Slim, gives the interactions with Helene a different feel. There's no possibility of Steve looking to swoop in and get Helene should Paul die. No, instead it's just a hard man offering help to a softer woman there to support her husband and doing a poor job of it. The moment of rest as Paul recuperates from his injury is where Helene makes it clear that there are similarities between Steve and Paul as well as between her and Slim. Paul doesn't think he's up for the job assigned to him, but he's going to do it anyway. That mirrors Steve's insistence that the fight against Vichy and Germany isn't his. Helene desire to stay by Paul's side no matter what mirrors Slim's own desire towards Steve. That Steve ends up getting involved in the end (yes, much like Rick in Casablanca) is what makes this parallel to Paul and Helene interesting.The final act is a tense series of events as the Vichy Captain Renard tries to ply Eddie with alcohol to find out what Steve was doing on his boat the night before, only to discover that Eddie is a more put together rummy than initially thought. The police are getting in closer, and Steve has to finally make a choice and become the man of action, finding a way to gain leverage over Renard that allows them opportunity to escape.This movie is mainly remembered for the steamy romance that developed between Bogart and Bacall, becoming some kind of Hollywood legend almost, but that's the least interesting part of the film to me. That is spends so much time dealing with their obvious chemistry, I think, ends up being a small flaw to the film. The rest of the movie around it is entertaining and a very good wartime thriller that almost feels behind the times being released in 1944, three years after America had gotten directly involved in the fight against Naziism. Steve's eventual decision to get involved in the fight feels political in a way, but also from a more innocent time when America wasn't willing to be part of the fight.",

After the famous \"just put your lips together...and blow\" scene, we agreed it was time to 'blow' the theater and head home. 'Nuff said.",

            "content": "\"To have and have not\" (1944, Howard Hawks) is a movie that is famous above all for its consequences and its prehistoryConsequences because this was the film during which Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall fell in love with each other. Afterwards they would for example also make \"The big sleep\" (1946, Howard Hawks) and \"Key Largo\" (1948, John Huston) together.Prehistory because the film was an attempt to capitalize on the success of \"Casablanca\" (1942, Michael Curtiz). \"To have and have not\" is based on the novel with the same name by Ernest Hemingway. Scenarist William Faulkner allowed himself however so much freedom that the story indeed has much in common with \"Casablanca\".It is situated in an exotic environment (of course Casablanca in \"Casablanca\" and Martinique in \"To have or have not\").Central location is a club / a hotel with a piano at the center of the room.It is situated at the beginning of the Second World War\nHumphrey Bogart plays one of the lead characters in both films.The Humphrey Bogart character is cynical and at first is not willing to choose siedes in the war, although eventually he does.The Humphrey Bogart character falls in love with a beautiful woman (Ingrid Bergman in \"Casablanca\", Lauren Bacall in \"To have and have not\")The main difference lies in the relation between Humphrey and his love interest.As already indicated in \"To have and have not\" he doesn't had to act his love, it was real. In this respect \"To have and have not\" is more intense.In \"Casablance\" there is a more direct link between the love affair and the Bogart character ultimately choosing the right side in the war.\"Casablanca\" ends with the two lovers saying goodbye. In \"To have and have not\" they leave together. So \"To have and have not\" is the more optimistic of the two.In my opinion it is not fair to judge \"To have and have not\" only as an \"Casablanca\" imitation. The film is good in its own right. Besides Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall also Walter Brennan did a good job playing the drunk Eddie. Howard Hawks, as always, is a master in ambiguous dialogue, partly to circumvent the production code. The most famous in \"To have and have not\" is the Bacall line \"You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and blow.\". The films sensuality shows however not only in its dialogue. During one of the songs of pianist Cricket (Hoagy Carmichael) some women's hips wiggle rhythmically in and out of the frame.",

You can sense during the picture that there was very little acting actually going on between the two leads while observing their obvious chemistry together. Bogart takes on a role as a fearless skipper-for-rent who winds up low on funds and agrees to pick up some dangerous cash by allowing himself to become caught up with a French Resistance plan. He meets and romances the sultry and just-as-tough Bacall between trips and their fireworks provide the main reason for watching the film.

William Falkner's dialogue as lifted from what seems to be Hemingway's worst novel crackles, espicially when delivered by Bacall.  Quite a debut and quite a pairing with Bogey.  This isn't to say that the rest of the film isn't good.  The supporting cast, espicially Walter Brennan and Hoagey Carmichael, are fun to watch, if not quite as good as the supporters in Casablanca.

            "content": "When interviewed in the 1970s, the director Howard Hawks made the claim that novelist Ernest Hemmingway described his book To Have and Have as his very worst; \"a pile of junk\". Whether Hemmingway really said this or not is uncertain. Hawks was a colourful character and any word from him should be read with a pinch or two of salt. The point however is clear, regardless of what the author thought, Hawks himself regarded the novel as junk. As such, when he filmed it he did not regard the story as important.So what is important in this motion picture? Simple: Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. Bogart was an old hand in the movies but he had only recently found his \"type\", the smart, laid-back individualist with a good heart under his hardened exterior. That persona was laid down in Casablanca a year or two earlier, but it was with To Have and Have Not that he met his perfect female companion. Lauren Bacall, a generation younger and in her first screen appearance, immediately projects a quality of her own that fits hand in glove with Bogart's. She's tough, intelligent, taking the attentions of a man because she wants them, not because she needs them, and a great mover who absorbs our attention the way a star should. All this comes through, not in her character as written, but in her reading of the character. This is very much the way things worked in old Hollywood \u2013 most actors would not mould themselves into their characters, they would mould the character around their own persona, which is no less a talent than method acting. Bacall was one of the last stars to adopt this style.How much of a hand Hawks had in moulding this amazing tour-de-force in screen chemistry is again the subject of his own somewhat dubious boasts. But responsible or not he certainly understood it. One of Hawks's greatest talents was the smoothness with which he could move in and out of broad focus to individual focus, building realistic environments and then suddenly making the players stand out, with our barely noticing that anything has changed. The opening scene features some very complex but naturalistic looking crowd shots on the dock. Bogart emerges from this crowd, and suddenly all other business seems to melt away, so all we see is him. At the end of the scene Bogart literally disappears back into the crowd. Bacall's first appearance, the \"Anybody got a match?\" scene, is completely meaningless and irrelevant as a part of the narrative, and yet Hawks shoots it in an incredibly stripped down style, barely any props visible, the only lighting a couple of streaks to give her a bit of definition. The scene is transformed from a couple of throwaway lines into the most memorable few shots in the picture so far. Hawks even allows the charismatic presence of the two leads to override any build-up of suspense and danger. In the scene where they are interrogated by Vichy regime captain, when Bogart is asked to hand over the travellers' cheques, the shot is arranged so that our eyes are drawn to the figure between them \u2013 Bacall lighting up a cigarette with characteristic poise.Of course, it's not just Bogie and Bacall on display here. But neither is there really a semblance of Hemmingway's story. Everything that stands out in To Have and Have Not is a piece of characterisation. Take the pianist played by Hoagy Carmichael, when compared to the one played by Dooley Wilson in Casablanca. Wilson's Sam is integral to Casablanca's plot, but Carmichael's Cricket is integral to this picture's atmosphere. The great Walter Brennan is allowed to dominate many scenes, in what is one of the most endearing of his numerous crusty old man acts. The scene where the Vichy captain and his heavies try to get information out of Brennan over a couple of whisky bottles is played entirely for laughs, even though on paper the scene is clearly designed for suspense. It's very funny moment, with an almost Marx Brothers-ish tone of disrespect for authority.And yet, perhaps this version of To Have and Have Not goes a little too far in ignoring its source text. With only the threadbare remains of a political intrigue adventure, the picture lacks any real sense of danger or excitement. Rather than detracting from the delightful screen chemistry between Bogart and Bacall, such a touch could have heightened it. This is why, for example, the most suspenseful of Hitchcock pictures were also scintillating romances. As it is, To Have and Have Not is filled with layer upon layer of wonderful style, but lacks the substance at its core that would make it a masterpiece.",

Bogie is a boat captain in Vichy Martinique who gets caught between the Nazis and Free French wanting to get onto the island. Just the idea of Nazis legitimately in the Caribbean during WWII is something to work with. Into the mix steps Bacall, looking and acting more than her 19 years. And there's the Walter Brennan lovable drunk character (which I found annoying), Bogie employs him and is particularly attached to him. There's a lot in this reminiscent of Casablanca, including the casino manager (\"ah, a few thousand less than I expected....\"), here as hotel manager, but the mood is lighter than in Casablanca. Some of the story is a little bit much, but over all this the interplay between Bogie and Bacall is absolutely sexy, fresh and enchanting. The back and forth can look very staged when the feeling isn't really there, but the chemistry between the stars on this one is as good as it gets. Particularly amusing is the way Bogie grudgingly appreciates and even encourages the scoundrel side of Bacall, while wondering if she's working that side on him too.

            "content": "1944's To Have or Have Not is one of those films that reminded me of Casablanca...in a good way. Perhaps not nearly a classic like the aforementioned film, Howard Hawks's film invokes memories of that particular movie. Some similarities are the usage of Humphrey Bogart and the French Resistance. I was captivated by the film as it showcased the powerful acting skills of both Bogart and the much younger Lauren Bacall. Hawks, the man behind the adventure film Barbary Coast and the screwball comedy Bringing Up Baby, is at his best here. What is known as \"Hawkism\" is on full display. In other words, it is a film about a strong, central male character and the similarly strong female. Being that personal integrity is one of the traits, we see that here with Bogart. Hawks has no time for \"losers,' which is why the ending is the way it is. In any case, this is a fun, action-packed adventure that will satisfy those craving for an adventure in the vein of Casablanca.I was very intrigued about how this film was produced. The novel the movie is based on was written by Nobel Peace Prize winner Ernest Hemingway. The author did not care to be a part of Hollywood. On a ten-day fishing trip, Hawks believed he could make an entertaining motion picture based off Hemingway's worst title, which he believed was To Have or Have Not. Jules Furthman was hired to write a draft. Joseph Breen, in charge of the Production Code, cited more than three dozen instances that violated the code (aren't we happy this code does not exist in modern times?). Originally set in Cuba, the script needed to be changed to appease the Roosevelt Administration because of their approach regarding Latin countries. Another Nobel Peace Prize winner, William Faulkner, was hired to make necessary changes to the screenplay to avoid political conflict between the Vichy government and Free France. It was he who suggested the idea that the setting be changed to the French-controlled island of Martinique. Despite all the changes, the screenplay is one of the highlights about the movie. It had great line of dialogue and it showcased the sexual tension between Bogart and Bacall. Ironically, the film is completely different from Hemingway's novel with the exception of the first fifteen minutes. I do hope Hemingway approved of the film.It is 1940 and World War II is well underway. The Nazis have taken control of France and its territories by this point, including Martinique. Harry Morgan (Humphrey Bogart) is an American who tries to remain inconspicuous as he takes tourists out on his fishing boat. One of his prospective clients ended up killed by a stray bullet. Desperate for money, Morgan is pressured into smuggling one of the leaders of the Free French onto the island. With his new friends Marie (otherwise known as Slim, played by Lauren Bacall) and Eddie (Walter Brennan), he must stay one or two steps ahead of the secret police. He tried to be neutral, but now Morgan needs to pick a side.Hawks always said his film existed to show the relationship between its two leads, which makes sense being the character-driven picture this is. Both were excellent. Can you be surprised at that statement? Bogart began dating Bacall (much to Hawks's disapproval) and they ended up married. You can sense their steaming chemistry with one another. I was always rooting for them to end up together. Hawks, being the type of director he is, allowed this to be the case. It is not a showy performance for Bogart, but he created something memorable. And Bacall catapulted to the A-list. Bacall was so good that Hawks had to downplay the other leading lady, Dolores Moran (who was also very good). In terms of supporting roles, I really liked Walter Brennan's performance as the constantly drunk friend of Harry's.Overall, it might be a good idea to give To Have or Have Not a look. I believe there is always a danger this title may end up being \"underrated.\" Yeah, it's not Casablanca but it does come close. It has epic action, sweeping romance, and thrills meant to chill your bones. I do not believe it is a full noir picture, but this comes as close as it gets with Hawks dabbling with the genre. There are critics who do call this a film-noir. Another reason to give the movie a look!My Grade: A-",

Bogart had made a series of World War II themed films during the war in Across the Pacific, Action in the North Atlantic, Sahara, Casablanca and Passage to Marseille and this was the sixth and final of those string of films. The Bogey at war formula might have worn a little thin by this film had it not been for his leading lady Lauren Bacall with whom he fell in love with during the filming. The 19 year old fashion model had only had some off Broadway role experience but a picture of her on the cover of Harper's Bizaar landed her a screen test for To Have and To Have Not which she passed effectively enough that they gave her the role of singer Marie 'Slim' Browining opposite Bogart. On screen chemistry turned into off screen love and the rest is movie history as they say. Hoagy Carmichael, Delores Moran, Marcell Dalio and Sheldon Leonard round out the cast. This was loosely adapted from the Ernest Hemingway story by Jules Furthman and William Faulkner who change the story so much that it's not recognizable as Hemingway's but they make a good screenplay with good roles for Bogart, Bacall and Brennan. Veteran cinematographer Sidney Hickox photographs the film. This film has had a long life on television and I've seen it several times and would give it an 8.5 out of 10.",

Humphrey Bogart - he goes by the fine piratical name of Captain Morgan - plays the typical cynical loner who takes tourists on fishing trips in the French Caribbean in the period shortly after the fall of France in 1940. He is approached by a secret representative of the Free French who want him to smuggle some of their people to Martinique. At the same time he meets a young American (Slim Browning, played by Lauren Bacall) and as a consequence loses some of his cynicism. In fact he falls in love. That is all very well acted, well-written (excellent dialogue!) and well-directed, and of course the chemistry between Bacall and Bogart is great. It is derivative, but not so derivative that there is no suspense. All in all a film that is quite a bit above average.",

            "review_title": "Casablanca: The Better Version.",
            "content": "Jean-Luc Godard listed Howard Hawks as the greatest American director of all-time. Godard and his oh-so-overrated Nouvelle Vague movement were in love with American cinema, and used Hawks as the definite representation of all that was well with American cinema. What is lacking in experimental visuals and style is made up with the ability to craft a wonderful and spellbinding fictional world with intricate plots and likable characters. The goal of American filmmakers of the classic days wasn't to manipulate or test the camera, it was to present a great story, keep the audience on the edge of their seats, and deliver excellent characters with quotable one-liners. Then give them the good ol' Hollywood ending in which everything is resolved and tightly bundled up like a nice package. To Have and Have Not is actually among the better classic films that match the description, even surpassing the Casablanca in terms of quality\u0097yes, I just said that.To Have and Have Not is one of Hawk's most popular films, as well as one of his best. Combining the talented writing of two Pulitzer Prize winners with an Academy Award-winning male lead with that male's wife-to-be with a character actor that's appeared in over 100 films and won 3 Oscars; then meshing that with the spot-on direction of Hawks himself, how can you go wrong with this movie? Not one element of the movie overshadows the other; the musical interludes are nice, there is a lot of suspense, sexual tension, romance, comedy, and the occasional action sequence wakes up the viewers. This movie has a lot of energy, which makes it different (and in my opinion superior) to that of those slow, dull, and stupid, lifeless, thoughtless European imports of the same time period. There is a reason why American cinema was beginning to conquer the movie theaters around the world back in the 1940s and 1950s.In this movie we follow a boat-owning duo Harry and Eddie (Humphrey Bogart and Walter Brennan) that run into trouble at the island of Martinique. In the island, they run into politics (involving mysteriously shady people that want Harry's boat for questionable circumstances), a mysterious yet beautiful woman (Lauren Bacall), and plenty of danger (a civil war-like resistance is occurring in the area). Unlike the novel, the politics instigating the conflicts are handled lightly and don't spur the pacing of the movie. Like previously stated, two Pulitzer Prize winners are involved with the script (William Faulkner and Ernest Hemmingway\u0097with the help of Jules Furthman) but there's plenty of improvisation from the actors as well. Aside from the beginning of the movie, almost every line of dialogue is important; as they continue the plot or unravel more mysteries about our main characters.Acting-wise, To Have and Have Not is a gem. Bogart sticks to the same kind of role, but in a case of if-it-ain't-broke-don't-fix-it, does an excellent job portraying Captain Morgan. Alongside him is his eventual wife and partner of several movies, Lauren Bacall. Bacall also excels in her role as the mysterious woman in the hotel that starts moving in to Morgan's life. Last but certainly not least is the excellent character actor Walter Brennan, who has the best performance as the scene-stealing partner of Morgan. His drunken antics and ways of communicating with people is one of the more believable portrayals of the classic era; his lines are delivered smoothly, not in a stern manner like most other actors at the time. A lot of action happens as well, and our acting ensemble here does very well while the shootouts are occurring and bullets are being thrown everywhere.Directing was also pretty much spot-on. Hawks never wastes a shot messing with the cinematography or with the camera as he from start to finish displays the story to the best of his abilities. His shots never run too short, nor do they run too long. Howard Hawks is all about the narrative; his belief is substance over style, and since when is this bad? The only moments in which the film slows down a bit too much are during the musical scenes, which sometimes drag a bit as the story hits a snag and we have to wait until the song is over. While this is done in order to ease the tension, it does become tedious the second and third time around. Just cutting a mere 10 minutes from the movie and this would have been an almost flawless flick.Bottom Line: A purely entertaining movie from start to finish, this movie beats Casablanca because it doesn't offer any dull moments, never becomes too melodramatic, never becomes too preachy, and offers more thrills and laughs as the 1942 so-called classic. With more action, more romance, and more wit than the average movie released during the same decade; the French critics were correct in choosing this as one of the defining America classics of the first half of the 20th century. The directing was good, the acting was good, the writing was grand, and like a good Hollywood classic, wraps up nicely towards the end leaving the audience fully satisfied. Godard should have taken some notes from this film on how to craft something remotely entertaining; because his movies all pale in comparison to this one. In a film that focuses on story and likable characters more than toying with the audience and with editing techniques, To Have and Have Not is worthy of a rental for a rainy Saturday night.\"You know you don't have to act with me, Steve. You don't have to say anything, and you don't have to do anything. Not a thing. Oh, maybe just whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and... blow.\"",

            "content": "It is not unusual for Hollywood to make multiple film versions that are based on popular novels and celebrity biographies. How are we to know which version is definitive? Sometimes (but by no means always), the movie's title may inform us of the answer to that question. For example, if you had to choose between a film titled \"Jesse James\" (1939) starring Tyrone Power (who was well known for playing handsome, brave and often heroic characters) and one titled \"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\" (2007) starring Brad Pitt (who is well known for playing sensitive, understated and often introspective characters)-----which version would you believe to be the one you should see? And in a similar vein, what would your choice be between a large series of films including such titles as \"Tarzan's New York Adventure\" (1941), \"Tarzan and the Amazons\" (1945) and \"Tarzan and the Mermaids\" (1948) versus one entitled \"Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes\" (1984)?Ernest Hemingway's novel \"To Have and Have Not\" (THAHN) presents us with a similar but more difficult problem involving the same kind of puzzle. The first film version (from1944 also titled THAHN) is quite different than its literary source in many ways, and in effect is almost a totally new story except for the fact that the leading male character is also named Harry Morgan. However, what this version has is Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall in their very first film together, and it affords us the unique opportunity to see one of Hollywood's most celebrated and enduring couples actually falling in love with each other in real time and before our own eyes! It also has the exceptional talents of legendary film director Howard Hawks helming one of his most acclaimed and characteristic movies. Finally, it co-stars Oscar winning actor Walter Brennan in another one of his truly outstanding supporting roles. The second film version (\"The Breaking Point\" (1950) or TBP) is considered by many reviewers and critics to be the one that is closest to Hemingway's written intentions and also one which contains an exceptional cinematic adaptation of a Hemingway story. It also captures a much praised portrayal of the Harry Morgan part by the great John Garfield in his penultimate movie performance. But Hemingway purists might object to the film's sanitizing of the author's political subtext as well as the insertion of a love triangle plot element that is missing from the original novel. The third (and thus far final) film version (\"The Gun Runners\" (1958)) is directed by cult favorite Don Siegel, but it is the most obscure and least successful with both critics and audience. Nonetheless, it is the only one that touches on the political issues that Hemingway originally felt were important to an understanding of what helped to motivate Morgan's actions.In the end, most of us will have to choose between either a film that has significant entertainment value for many of the previously cited reasons, or a movie that better captures the real essence of one of Hemingway's less well-known novels. Either THAHN or TBP is worth your time and attention, and both films deserve a fresh visit (or revisit) from a modern audience.",

            "content": "Although a film version of Ernest Hemingway's 1937 novel of the same name, the film is also a clever psychological war propaganda film - proving that the masters of propaganda during WW 2 were actually Hollywood script writers; having even surpassed Joseph Goebbels' propaganda machine during the course of WW2 - in my opinion :)A nice romantic action comedy set during WW2, the main character - Harry 'Steve' Morgan - is portrayed as quite an omnipotent American figure; being fancied by French and American women alike :)Interesting to note, that Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall - as Steve and 'Slim' - were married in real life, and had a cool relationship on the film set - as well as in real life.So for all those Hollywood couples who are experiencing some marriage problems - such as communication problems and lack of sexual Intimacy - here is some good advice: Before filing for divorce, just take a look at this beautiful classic, and see how a true relationship between an actor and an actress is supposed to work :)So the plot is centered on the romance between Steve and Slim, in the summer of 1940 in Martinique - which is complicated by the growing French resistance in Vichy France - the French regime, which collaborated with Nazi Germany during that time.The film was released in 1944, shortly after the Allied invasion of Normandy in \"Operation Overlord\" during World War II. The Allies aimed to push back Nazi forces; so the film was probably also meant as a morale booster for the American G. I.'s fighting in Europe - with a conciliatory approach between France and the Allies - since the British destroyed France's Navy during that time, as it stood accused of having sided with the Nazis.Indeed, we have a similar problem today - in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine - with France not doing enough to make Peace. (e.g. President Macron is unwilling to deploy the Foreign French Legion in Ukraine, to rout and vanquish the neo-Nazi Russian Wagner Group :)However, I'm sure that in due course of time that will change, and that France will also contribute to make Peace in Ukraine; with Washington, London - as well as Paris - asking Ukraine and Russia to show openness for Peace Talks :)So our proposal would be the following: The Russian Armed Forces will withdraw from Ukraine - including all illegally occupied territories. In return Russia can govern the Crimean Peninsula under the condition that it will be demilitarised.Furthermore a permanent UN Peacekeeping mission should be stationed in Sevastopol to make sure that International Law is upheld by both Russia and Ukraine. We urge both Russia and Ukraine to accept this proposal.We also propose to invite Russia into a new International Peacebuilding Alliance - as already should have been done after the Cold War but which the US neglected to do missing the opportunity of a potential reconciliation with Russia.We realize that this would not be a perfect solution and that both Russia and Ukraine would only grudgingly accept it. But in view of the failure of the Minsk peace agreements we simply have to make a new start :)\nWe also would like to remind the leaders of Russia and Ukraine that tens of thousands of soldiers, innocent civilians and Children have died in this horrific war. Hence we strongly encourage Russia and Ukraine to make Peace, in the name of Humanity.PS: As the acting US President I can confirm that ex-President Vladimir Putin is NOT on the CIA kill list. As the new leader of the US, I personally would have to give the order to take Vladimir Putin out - which I'm NEVER going to do. No joke :)",

The location is great, brilliant studio / stage work, for instance the hotel caf\u00e9 which the story is based around, works so well for the film. It is idyllic and real. Bacall & Hoagy's musical friendship is adorable.Everything ties up well, Huston's story & direction is impeccable. A total romantic drama. If you want a film that stays with you, then watch this.~Paul Browne.",

I first saw this movie more than 12 years ago, and some of the lines still stick in my mind. One of the best things about to have and have not is the way Bogey and Bacall verbally spar throughout the movie. Quite apart from the later Hollywood tradition of the plot pushing the two characters together, quite apart from their believability as a couple, this movie's engine is the genuine interactions between the two leads. Watching these two hard boiled characters come to trust, then love, is one of the best things ever put on celluloid. By comparison, Casablanca seems (with all due respect to the Casablanca fans) a little staged. Bogey and Bacall light up each scene they're in - comparatively Ingrid Bergman seems a little stiff, not as evocative as the oh so hot Lauren Bacall. Summing up - watch this movie.",

And while it 'has not' the budget, length, or glamour of its alter-ego, it 'has' an eccentric realism Casablanca can't touch.Instead of Rick the heartbroken bar-owner, Bogie plays Harry the angry fish-boat owner. Like Rick, Harry's an American expatriate living in an exotic French colony during WWII. Like Rick, Harry wants no involvement in the war, or the people in it. Like Rick, Harry changes his mind because of a woman.What separates To Have and Have Not from Casablanca is its unwillingness to wrap things up into simple, pretty packages. This realism gives the movie a charm that makes it a lot more believable than Casablanca.\nUnlike Ingrid Bergman, Lauren Bacall is an earthy, multi-layered character, the perfect foil for Bogie. She calls him Steve (for no reason in particular), tries to get under his skin, and delivers some of the most memorable lines in cinematic history. \"You know how to whistle, don't ya Steve?\"Walter Brennan is at his caricature best, playing the fool (and Harry's conscience). He helps--and hinders--Harry/Steve's attempt to help a resistance fighter to safety, while providing a few light laughs to complement the witty jousting between Bogie and Bacall.The world is not at stake in Martinique, and everything doesn't end with a beautiful friendship.

Bogart and Bacall have to put their lives on the line to smuggle another defender of free Europe to friendly territory. Even though it's a little derivative of Casablanca, it's impossible to turn down another excellent wartime tale of a desperate fight for freedom against a collection of suspicious natives and Nazi stooges.

Also the Bogey character is \"just minding his own business\" and not wanting to become involved in the local's problems. There is also a heroic freedom fighter with his beautiful wife and the police captain is named Renard (in Casablanca it was Renaud).The cast is excellent and the direction by Howard Hawks keeps the story moving and the screen sizzling with the Bogey and Bacall pairing. Also along for the ride are Walter Brennan as Bogey's boozy pal, Hoagy Carmichael singing the classic \"Am I Blue?\", Dan Seymour doing his best Sydney Greenstreet impersonation as Renard, the beautiful Dolores Moran as Helene DeBrusac and a totally miscast Sheldon Leonard as Lt. Coyo, Renard's assistant.And who can ever forget the classic lines from Bacall to Bogey after a lengthy kiss: \"it's better when you help\" and \"You know how to whistle don't you?

Bogart turns in a fine performance as Harry Morgan, or 'Steve' as Slim calls him; it's hard to imagine anyone else playing Harry. Though not a particularly demanding role and one into which many actors could probably have fitted initially, it is Bogart's magic that he takes a role not necessarily tailored to him, and still makes it his own. Bacall too, all husky voice and \"The Look\", sizzles on the screen--her Slim is sexy, beautiful, and real, all at the same time. The film itself is definitely worth watching. But as an added (or perhaps the main!) bonus, watch Bogart meet his Baby. It's cinematic history--cinematic magic--in the making.",

I know, I know \u0096 it's based on Hemingway, directed by Hawks with a screenplay co-written by William Faulkner. However, Hemingway's book is adjusted and truncated for Hollywood purposes (both for practical reasons and in terms of content). The actual plot leftover isn't strong enough or interesting enough to carry the film on its own. Important things go unexplained. (For example, Bogart's Capt. Morgan is inexplicably great at everything. He's a sailor, business owner, diplomat, surgeon, crack shot, ladies man and a superb wit. Where did he learn to do all that?) The supporting characters, with the exception of Walter Brennan's DT-afflicted rummy, are flat and colorless (as opposed to those in say, CASABLANCA).

More and more, I find overly witty dialogue to feel contrived (how is it that I never think of anything that clever off the top of my head?), but here again, I give credit to Bogart and Bacall for making it work.

In spite of my pointing out its shortcomings, I want to be clear that I still consider TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT to be masterful entertainment, but it's the reason why it works so well that I find particularly interesting. I can't think of another movie in history that was as reliant on the sexual tension between two actors. Certainly Tracy and Hepburn had rapport in ADAM'S RIB. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan had a platonic, fun banter thing going on in WHEN HARRY MET SALLY. But none of them generate the pure, raw HEAT provided by Bogie and Bacall. The closest any recent film has come was probably Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas in THE English PATIENT (I'm sure you guys have some thoughts on this \u0096 any other screen couples come close?) with the major difference of course being that Almasy and Katharine got to consummate their lust during the course of the film.

            "content": "Of course \"To Have and Have Not\" is most famous for the screen debut of Lauren Bacall, and yes, the 19 year old neophyte holds her own with star Bogie, and the sparks fly. But there's another drop dead gorgeous dame in this film, Dolores Moran. She would have to be gorgeous to make Bacall's character jealous, and that jealousy is an interesting wrinkle that helps spur the romance between her and Bogart's Harry. I love the scene in the movie when Bogie carries the unconscious Moran from the room where he has just operated on her husband. Bacall's line, \"what are you trying to do, guess her weight,\" and the way she jumps in when Bogie says that her clothes need to be loosened makes me laugh every time. (And I've seen this movie multiple times).I also think that Moran gives a good performance in this movie, handling her more serious lines very well. Her IMDB bio say she was better known for her off screen romantic escapades than her on-screen performances. Maybe that's true, but she was good in this movie and also gave a funny performance in \"The Horn Blows at Midnight\" as the bad girl who puts Jack Benny through the ringer. Sometimes when a woman has spectacular looks it can almost work against her, as people think she's just eye candy and don't focus on her acting.Aside from Ms. Moran, this is a very enjoyable movie, kind of a \"Casablanca Light\" but with some of its own flavor. Funny, I first saw this movie when I was young and remember thinking that it was really shot on the island of Martinique. It instilled in me the romantic desire to someday visit Martinique or some other exotic Caribbean port-of-call. When I see the movie now I wonder how I thought it was a real island location. The port and city streets are all obviously studio sets. But the movie is so skillfully done that you really don't care. In that regard it's also similar to Casablanca. We know we're on a backlot and not in Morocco, but still get caught up in the story and happy believe we're really in some exotic, sun-drenched destination.",

In some parts, the parallels are less favorable with respect to Hawks' film than others, particularly the somewhat light story and the atmosphere, which never delivers the grim hopelessness (or at least bittersweetness) that made Bogart and Bergman's tragic romance shine so brightly. Where the film compensates is Bogart and Bacall's chemistry and characters, which sizzle with easy charm that is reinforced by the actors' real-life affection for one another. The movie sustains itself predominantly based off their exchanges, from moments of aloof appraisal to searing jealousy. The ending is surprisingly neatly wrapped-up and cheery in tone, as Bogart's literal Captain Morgan single-handedly holds off the local party collaborators, including a relatively unheralded but pleasingly greasy Dan Seymour, so they can all leave with just a couple sexy scars.

The style of the story, and many of the themes contained in it were similar. It wasn\u0092t a remake by any means, but it had a familiarity that was kind of nice. The performance of Humphrey Bogart is exactly what I want from him. He has that strong and suave nature which gives you assurance that he is always in control. But almost outshining him is Lauren Bacall. She is stunning, and I\u0092m not just talking about her looks. She has a gorgeous singing voice, and massive amounts of charisma. Bogart and Bacall are a great pair and give you something to root for throughout the film. The story doesn\u0092t have the best flow to it, because I often feel like things are going around in circles. They don\u0092t build as much tension as they could. There are a number of scenes where I feel like the risk of discovery should be high, but they kind of shrug it off like it\u0092s no big deal and there\u0092s no danger. It was just a bit odd because I expected more drama in some of those scenes. However, it didn\u0092t really matter for me. To Have and Have Not almost could have been random rambling nonsense as long as they kept that romance between Bogart and Bacall intact. They made this movie a winner for me despite any flaws I saw in its plotting.",

On the other hand, it was 19-year-old Lauren Bacall's first film, and she displays a sultriness and presence not often seen in someone so young.  Bogart is also strong as the fishing boat skipper in Martinique who wants nothing to do with politics or the French resistance, but finds himself drawn into events as they unfold.  He's gritty, tough, and real, and has a couple of fantastic scenes with Bacall, where their chemistry is apparent despite him being 25 years older, including the one where she so famously says to him \"You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and ... blow.\"  I also liked musical performances led by Hoagy Carmichael, though Bacall's singing in the numbers she was in was pretty awkward.  Like I said, it's not perfect, but it is solid and entertaining, and as the start of 'Bogie and Bacall', has a place in film history.",

The duo's exchanges rise above the mediocre melodrama which characterises the rest of Hawk's film: a not-so-fine-tuned fairytale torn between capitalising on the likes of Casablanca and introducing and exploring wistful subplots.\nBogie's bone-dry wit and Bacall's devilish glare are a recipe for some of the best sexual tension in 1940s cinema - and producers quickly latched onto this following the film's release. Both actors have made better pictures since, but will always be best remembered for that iconic 'whistle' scene.

Morgan's right-hand man is Eddie (Walter Brennan), a garrulous alky whose pet question to anyone and everyone is \"Ever get stung by a dead bee?\" While in port, Harry is approached by Free French activist Gerard (Marcel Dalio), who wants to charter Harry's boat to smuggle in an important underground leader. Adopting his usual I-stick-my-neck-out-for-no-one stance, Morgan refuses. Later on, he starts up a dalliance with Marie Browning (screen newcomer Lauren Bacall), an attractive pickpocket. In order to help Marie return to America, Harry agrees to Gerard's smuggling terms. He uses his boat to bring resistance fighter De Bursac (Walter Molnar) and De Bursac's wife Helene (Dolores Moran) into Martinique. The Vichy police, suspecting that something's amiss, hold Morgan's pal Eddie hostage, tormenting the poor rummy by denying him liquor. Predictably, Morgan comes to Eddie's rescue and manages to escape Martinique, with the delectable Marie as cozy company. In the hands of director Howard Hawks and screenwriters Jules Furthman and William Faulkner, the end result bore only a passing relation to the original story by Ernest Hemingway: instead, it was a virtual rehash (but a good one!) of the recently released Casablanca, replete with several of that film's cast members. The film's enduring popularity is primarily -- if not solely -- due to the sexy chemistry between Bogart and Bacall, especially in the legendary \"You know how to whistle, don't you?\" scene. The most salutary result of To Have & Have Not was the subsequent Bogart-Bacall marriage, which endured until his death in 1957. It's widely believed that Lauren Bacall's singing voice was dubbed in by a pre-puberty Andy Williams; this is not true. For the record, a more faithful-to-the-source cinemadaptation of the Hemingway original was filmed in 1950 as The Breaking Point.\nMy Review\nA great black and white classic from Warners Bros To Have and have not revolves around Harry a captain boat owner played by the great Humprhery Bogart in wartime Martinque. Morgan's right hand man Eddie played by Walter Bernnan a garrulous alky whose pet question to anyone and everyone is \"Ever get stung by a dead bee?\" which to me is a funny one liner in this film. While in port Harry is approached by free French activist Gerard who want's to charter Harry's boat to smuggle in an an important underground. Adopting his usual I-stick-my-neck-out-for-no-one stance, Morgan refuses. Later on, he starts up a dalliance with Marie Browning (screen newcomer Lauren Bacall), an attractive pickpocket. In order to help Marie return to America, Harry agrees to Gerard's smuggling terms. He uses his boat to bring resistance fighter De Bursac (Walter Molnar) and De Bursac's wife Helene (Dolores Moran) into Martinique. This film is fun it's masterful and really really really great.",

If you think you saw this plot before, you would be right; the original story based on the Ernest Hemingway novel was extensively re-worked to resemble the superior Casablanca which had been released three years earlier.\r\n\r\nThe film marked the debut of Lauren Bacall and there are a ton of great exchanges between the two, the most famous being the \"just whistle\" scene. There are many others equally as good, however, including an exchange about strings that has Bacall walking around Bogart, and a great line from Bacall about \"walking home if it weren't for all that water.\"  The banter between the two was probably the best part of the film since it the film relies on a what had become a well worn plot and was based on what Hemingway considered his worst novel. This movie is not as good as Bogie's classics: Casablanca or The Maltese Falcon, and the subsequent Bogart-Bacall pairing in Key Largo has far more suspense & tension within it. However, few films in history  can equal To Have and Have Not for its on-screen chemistry.",

While he shows himself as a very stubborn man, he ultimately realizes that by helping the French resistance smuggle one of their operators, he may gain respect. In the meantime, he develops a romance with Mrs. Bacall character (and who wouldn't), who shows her singing talent in one of the most memorable, climatic scenes in the movie, which serves as a fine interlude to the thrilling plot.

Predictably, Morgan comes to Eddie's rescue and manages to escape Martinique, with the delectable Marie as cozy company. In the hands of director Howard Hawks and screenwriters Jules Furthman and William Faulkner, the end result bore only a passing relation to the original story by Ernest Hemingway: instead, it was a virtual rehash (but a good one!) of the recently released Casablanca, replete with several of that film's cast members. The film's enduring popularity is primarily -- if not solely -- due to the sexy chemistry between Bogart and Bacall, especially in the legendary \"You know how to whistle, don't you?\" scene. The most salutary result of To Have & Have Not was the subsequent Bogart-Bacall marriage, which endured until his death in 1957. It's widely believed that Lauren Bacall's singing voice was dubbed in by a pre-puberty Andy Williams; this is not true. For the record, a more faithful-to-the-source cinemadaptation of the Hemingway original was filmed in 1950 as The Breaking Point. \nMy Review\nA great black and white classic from Warners Bros To Have and have not revolves around Harry a captain boat owner played by the great Humprhery Bogart in wartime Martinque. Morgan's right hand man Eddie played by Walter Bernnan a garrulous alky whose pet question to anyone and everyone is \"Ever get stung by a dead bee?\" which to me is a funny one liner in this film. While in port Harry is approached by free French activist Gerard who want's to charter Harry's boat to smuggle in an an important underground.   Adopting his usual I-stick-my-neck-out-for-no-one stance, Morgan refuses. Later on, he starts up a dalliance with Marie Browning (screen newcomer Lauren Bacall), an attractive pickpocket. In order to help Marie return to America, Harry agrees to Gerard's smuggling terms. He uses his boat to bring resistance fighter De Bursac (Walter Molnar) and De Bursac's wife Helene (Dolores Moran) into Martinique.  This film is fun it's masterful and really really really great.",

Sure, the real love story behind the film of Bogey and \"Betsy\" (her real first name) Lauren Bacall is now days what people love to see, but as a story/movie its pretty mundane.\r\n\r\nTo Have and Have Not is a 1944 romance-war-adventure film. The movie was directed by Howard Hawks and stars Humphrey Bogart, Walter Brennan, and Lauren Bacall in her first film.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is nominally based on the novel of the same name by Ernest Hemingway, the story was extensively altered for the film.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Lauren_Bacall_with_Hoagy_Carmichael_in_To_Have_and_Have_Not_Trailer.jpg/275px-Lauren_Bacall_with_Hoagy_Carmichael_in_To_Have_and_Have_Not_Trailer.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe action scenes where Bogey displays his former tough guy image are of course, fantastic.  Tired of being questioned by authorities, he soon lets the audience and his actor foes what real threats on stage mean.  Terrifying, fast talking Bogart soon lets us all know who's in charge.\r\n\r\nThe actors have several of the cast from Casablanca and Key Largo.  Walter Brennan, the drunken sailer Bogart defends to the end, has a limp that he immortalized in a much later sixties television show The Real McCoys.\r\n\r\n[img]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Hoagy_Carmichael_in_To_Have_and_Have_Not_trailer.jpg/150px-Hoagy_Carmichael_in_To_Have_and_Have_Not_trailer.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n1     William Faulkner, \"out of print and broke\", was on the payroll, helping with the script.\r\n\r\n2     This was Lauren Bacall's first film, at the age of 19. Hawks' wife \"Slim\" (whose nickname would be applied to Bacall's character, Marie) noticed Bacall on the cover of Harper's Bazaar and showed the photo to her husband, who soon sought out Bacall and signed her for the role.\r\n\r\n3     Although Hawks had a high regard for Hemingway's works in general, he considered To Have and Have Not his worst book, a \"bunch of junk,\" and told Hemingway so; Hawks and Hemingway worked on the story together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVIEWS:\r\n\r\n1    The movie is basically a rip-off of \"Casablanca,\" but it's got some marvelous dialogue and great intrigue.\r\n\r\n2    80% \r\n     This movie is not in the league of Casablanca, which it resembles in more ways than one, but is still highly enjoyable....\r\n\r\n\r\n3    90% \r\n     The first of two classic films Howard Hawks did with Bogart and Bacall contains great dialogue and great performances. \r\n\r\n\r\n4     70% \r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605 (out of four) \r\n\r\nThe legendary couple of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall is born in this intriguing and stylish thriller....\r\n\r\n\r\n5      ...an intriguing, romantic, sometimes exciting, predictable but entertaining motion picture.\r\n\r\n6    The film was Bacall's first movie and the project on which she and Bogart met.

This is the first film I'd seen Bacall in, and her stunning beauty is only exceeded by her excellent performance (which is even more amazing, when you consider her age at the time).  And, when you see her and Bogart sharing scenes you can't help but feel the electricity between them.  Add to this Walter Brennan in the comedy-relief sidekick role, and that alone makes this a classic.  But that's not all (as a famous TV spokesperson might say):  Hoagy Carmichael is merely icing on the cake (filling the Dooley Wilson cabaret piano player role).  As for the story itself, well it's not hard to see the comparisons with \"Casablanca\", though in this outing Bogart seems to exhibit more attitude, not even trying to hide his disdain for the occupying forces.  The only thing missing from this is a Claude Rains-ally in the local police force.  I'd probably rank this third among my favorite Bogart flicks (behind \"The Maltese Falcon\" and \"Casablanca\"), and though not quite in my top-10 list, I think it'd deserve a place somewhere in the top-20.",

            "content": "Howard Hawks' TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT [1944]:  Stories of love and romance are definitely not an uncommon subject to cinema, regardless of what genre a romantic subplot seems an almost mandatory thing especially with a lot of classic films. When the iconic Humphrey Bogart had achieved super stardom in the wake of starring in films like THE MALTESE FALCON [1941] and CASABLANCA [1942], audiences just loved seeing the rugged and charming Bogart being a conquering silver screen hero with a romantic conquest attached. In the wake of the now infamous romantic war time drama CASABLANCA in 1942 Bogart proved to audiences that even he could be a romantic hero. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1944 when the legendary Movie producer and director Howard Hawks wanted to adapt one of the novels by one of the most Celebrated  writer of the 20th century Ernest Hemingway . Hawks boldly proclaimed he could successfully adapt what he believed was the worst thing Hemingway had written, the novel TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT having the story changed   and eventually ending up with a script that later bore next-to-nothing in common with the novel. The decision to place the middle Aged Bogart in this wartime star vehicle along side with a young new comer called Lauren Bacall sparked one of Hollywood's most iconic romances of the classic era. So in this instalment of this review series I now take look at the film that gave birth to the romance between Bogart and Bacall.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUMPHREY BOGART FORTNIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nDay Two: TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT [1944] before and during the production of this film, Bogart's third marriage to Mayo Methot was already on shaky ground when Bogie met Bacall upon the set of this film. The romance ended Bogart's relationship marriage to Methot and not long after the completion of this film the pair ended up becoming married, which was to last until the death of Bogart in 1957. As a result of the real onscreen passion between Bogart and Bacall the film became a huge box-office success and gave rise to Bacall's stardom. Despite the legendary romance that this film sparked, the film's plot draws heavily upon that classic earlier Bogart film CASABLANCA rather than Hemingway's Novel. Despite all of this the film itself today holds up as a simple piece of entrainment from the Wartime era.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLOTLINE\r\n\r\nSet in 1940 upon the French Colony of Martinique shortly after the fall of France and the establishment of the German friendly Vichy-France regime of the Caribbean Island.  TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT sees Bogart's character a world -weary American Fishing Boat Captain called Harry \"Steve\" Morgan, his pal the Alcoholic Eddie, his crew on a fishing charter that seems to be going with a stubborn Client who won't pay up for the charter.  Back at the Hotel were Harry and the Client are living, Harry meets an American Drifter called Helene (Bacall) who reviles that she stole his client's wallet. When Harry examines the wallet he discovers that his client was planning to leave the Island without paying him. Upon trying to question his client in the bar, the client gets killed amidst a shootout between Vichy Police and Free-French Resistance members. After the Vichy Police pulls in Harry, Helene and the Hotel owner Frenchy for integration, Harry's passport and money are taken from him.\r\n \r\nWith his client dead and wanting to get Helene off the Island, Harry in need of some money takes up a job to help the remaining Free-French associates of Frenchy. The mission is to get an important member of the Resistance off Devil's Island and take them to Martinique. When Harry makes the pickup with the drunken Eddie, the pair's situation ends up in a lot of danger when they shot up a search light of a Vichy Patrol boat and having the important figure wounded in the chaos. Upon arriving backing in Martinique Harry, Helene and the resistance struggle to nurse back to health and keep the wounded figure hidden from the Vichy Regime. Unfortunately it isn't all clear sailing ahead for the main cast when the lead Vichy Police Chief figures out the culprits responsible for the destruction of the Patrol boat's searchlight.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACTING, DIRECTION, SCRIPTING AND CINEMA-PHOTOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n \r\nFor starters the performances by Bogart and Bacall are very good but their onscreen chemistry can't be criticised at all for the simple fact the pair were falling in love with each other on the set. With the legendary dialogue with a fair degree of sexual innuendo like Bacall uttering her infamous line \"You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and... Blow\" it's no wonder why this film became a box office hit for Warner Bother Studios due to the romance between Bogart and Bacall. The rest of the cast give fairly decent performances around this, as for the direction by Hawks it's very good to say the least as the same can be said with the cinema-photography.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the Script it's almost impossible not to see the similarities between CASABLANCA for its Vichy controlled setting, the main hero (an American) who is reluctant to fight at all, a bar were the workers are involved with the resistance and so on and so forth. Despite it being a hybrid adaptation of Hemingway's Novel and the screenplay to CASABLANCA, the story to this World War Two era romantic-thriller is never the less highly entertaining film overall  , but the real focus of the film regardless of everything is of course Bogart and Bacall  while everything takes a backseat. My rating is a solid 80% for this classic Bogart gem of the wartime Bogart films.",

Of course you could put a lot of it down to luck, after all how often can you get your stars to fall in love? But not every directors can enthuse that into the characters and film itself. In the hands of someone else this would have been a dull, forgettable film. Apparently (according to Hawks) the film was made out of a bet with Hemingway, that he could make a good film out of his worst book. Sounds arrogant, but in Hawks case, quite well justified. Mind you, it helps Hawks had his secret weapon at hand - William Faulkner writing the screenplay.",

Bacall is unbelievably gorgeous and sexy as hell, equal in poise and pulchritude to any actress of the day, and it's almost impossible to accept she was only 19 at the time. Bogart fits well in this one -- something that can't always be said -- and it's obvious the cast is comfortable working with each other as well as director Howard Hawks.

            "content": "Bogart and Bacall sizzle together on screen  because they took to an actual affair three weeks into shooting. It's always better when no one's faking, right? \n\nBogart was 45; Bacall 19. According to a \"Vanity Fair\" piece, just a year earlier, before she ever saw Hollywood, she watched Bogie onscreen in \"Casablanca\" and thought to herself: \"yuck.\"  Yet a year later she had screen-tested, taken the leading role and found herself falling hard for Bogie's extramarital wooing. Another year later, they were wed - and remained together until he passed away 12 years later.She said they were the best years of her life.  Most people have long forgotten, but it was during those years that Bogie & Bacall became charter members of \"The Rat Pack.\"\n\nThe feel of the film and the setting is certainly reminiscent of \"Casablanca.\" It's Vichy/Nazi controlled Martinque instead of Morocco ... and it's a dive bar/hotel instead of a casino. Big diff. And the intrigue revolves around similar plotline, how shady people get in and out of town under the nose of the local, less-than-respectable law.\n\n\"Casablanca\" is more for romance, I suppose, this one more about lust. Still, this film makes a great double-bill, with Bacall shooting steamy looks and fast talk all over Bogart, who at times almost looks dumbfounded for it. \n\nEspecially when she hits him with the now-iconic lines ... \"You know you don't have to act with me, Steve. You don't have to say anything, and you don't have to do anything. Not a thing. Oh, maybe just whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together ... and blow.\"\n\nHoagy Carmichael, in cameo as the dive's resident piano player, deals out the  tunes. Walter Brennan, in the role of Bogie's alcoholic, limping wingman, looks pretty much exactly as old and as drunk as he did in \"Rio Bravo\" playing the same part fifteen years later. Yep, he's the \"Real McCoy,\" all right.\n\nTRIVIA: Based on a Hemmingway novel that was remade first in 1950 as \"The Breaking Point\" starring John Garfield & Patricia Neal, then again in 1958 as \"The Gun Runners\" starring Audie Murphy.\n \nRECOMMENDATION: Bogie & Bacall ... are you kidding?

The exchanges between Bogart and Bacall are especially fun. One of the most memorable parts of the film is the friendship between Bogart and the character of Eddie. Eddie is an alcoholic who relies on Bogart for everything. While, Bogart's character is similar to his character in \"Casablanca\", here his character  at least tries to keep some human relationship intact instead of completely closing himself off to friends and love. It's a softer character and also just as tough. And ofcourse Bogart plays it perfectly. Overall, It's the kindof film you can't get tired of...you just want to watch atleast twice a year so you can forget everything and get swept up in this wonderful adventure of a film.\n\nFun Quotes:\n\n\"You know Steve, you're not very hard to figure, only at times.

            "content": "\"To Have and Have Not\" grew out of a conversation between Ernest Hemingway and Howard Hawks. Hawks had tried to persuade Hemingway to write screenplays, but Hemingway refused. Hawks told Hemingway, \"I can make a picture out of your worst story.\" Hemingway asked, \"What's my worst story?\" Hawks replied \"a bunch of junk\" called \"To Have and Have Not.\" \"You can't make anything out of that,\" Hemingway argued. Hawks retorted, \"Yes, I can.\" The novel \"To Have and Have Not\" concerned a charter boat captain, Harry Morgan, who loses the money owed to him by a client who leaves him in the lurch without paying his bill. Reluctantly, Morgan accepts money from rumrunners to ship their contraband merchandise. He gets shot-up, loses an arm, and his boat. Later, Morgan dies after he contends with bank robbers who force him to take them to safety using his boat. Hawks sold the story for a quarter interest in the movie to Warner Brothers, and in 1943 the studio cast Humphrey Bogart as the lead.\n\nInitially, when Howard Hawks began work on the film, the U.S. Government objected to the use of Cuba as the setting. They worried that audiences might confuse the political regime in the Hemingway novel with America's current ally, the Batista government running Cuba. Hawks and his good friend William Faulkner changed the setting to the French territory of Martinique. Furthermore, Faulkner advised Hawks to rewrite the politics of the movie so that it dealt with the clashing aims of Vichy France and Free France.\n\nLike Hemingway's novel, the film \"To Have and Have Not\" opens with professional skipper Harry Morgan (Humphrey Bogart) taking his client, Mr. Johnson (Walter Sande), fishing off the coast of Fort de France, Martinique. After sixteen days of bad luck, Johnson quits, lies about having no money, and tries to leave Morgan without paying his bill. When Harry discovers Johnson's lies, he confronts him and Johnson is about to sign over $825 worth of traveler's checks. During a shoot out between Vichy police and suspected Free French resistance agents, Johnson is caught in the crossfire and dies. Earlier, the Free French had tried to hire Harry to smuggle one of their members onto the island. Reluctantly, since the police have confiscated his cash and the money owed him by Johnson, Harry accepts the Free French offer. By this time, Harry has gotten involved with a beautiful but mysterious woman, Marie Browning (Lauren Bacall), only recently arrived in Martinique and short of finances herself. She had tried to steal Johnson's wallet, but Harry caught her and discovered Johnson's financial solvency.\n\nHarry and his longtime alcoholic sidekick Eddie (Walter Brennan) pick up Helene De Bursac (Dolores Moran) and her husband Paul (Walter Szurovy) but encounter a Vichy patrol boat. Harry shoots out its search light and loses the patrol boat in the fog. Unfortunately, Paul De Bursac catches a slug in his chest. Predictably, Vichy Police Captain Renard (Dan Seymour) questions our heroes at their hotel about their trip. Harry and Eddie lie that they were fishing for marlin when a German U-boat frightened them. Later, Harry digs the spent bullet out of De Bursac's chest with Marie's help. Captain Renard renews his suspicions and arrests Eddie. Later, Renard and his agents corner Harry at the hotel where he lives when he is not taking customers on fishing trips. Harry catches the dastardly Renard with his guard down, kills one of his henchmen, and then claps Renard and company in handcuffs. After slugging the police captain on the head, Harry convinces Renard to turn Eddie loose. Eddie, Marie, and Harry get De Bursac off the island to safety.\n\n\"To Have and Have Not\" deals with the usual themes that obsessed Hawks. All good Hawksian characters are professionals in the strictest sense and a later scene between Harry and Paul De Bursac establishes the quintessential characteristics of the Hawks hero. De Bursac describes the chief characteristic, \"When you meet danger, you never think of anything except how you will circumvent it. The word failure does not even exist for you . . .\" \"To Have and Have Not\" boasts some memorable dialogue, especially between Bogart and Bacall. The \"whistle\" scene is now the stuff of legends, like the horse race dialogue in their next movie \"The Big Sleep.\" Interestingly, Bogart and Bacall fell in love during filming while Bogart was still married to his alcoholic wife actress Mayo Methot. Eventually, Bogart divorced Methot and married Bacall. Walter Brennan's shtick about \"was you ever bit by a dead bee?\" is hilarious.\n\nEnough similarities exist between \"To Have and Have Not\" and \"Casablanca\" to make comparisons inevitable. Like the Bogart hero in \"Casablanca,\" necessity compels Harry to abandon his isolationist attitude and aid the Free French. Unlike \"Casablanca,\" no actual Nazi German characters appear in \"To Have and Have Not,\" but Madame De Bursac does mention them in passing. Furthermore, World War II does not play a major role in the story apart from the street shoot-out between Vichy authorities and the Free French as well as Renard's search for De Bursac. Unlike the doomed \"Casablanca\" romance between Rick and Ilsa, Marie and Harry have never met, and nobody comes between Harry and Marie. Unlike Rick, Harry owns a charter fishing boat rather than a tavern. Indeed, Paul De Bursac and his wife do resemble fugitive Czech Resistance leader Victor Laszlo, but De Bursac has come to Martinique to rescue a Free Frenchman imprisoned on Devil's Island.",

Add that to the flawless chemistry between him and Lauren  Bacall and this becomes a movie you fall in love with rather than admire. I always feel I need to mention Walter Brennan when he shows up in Howard Hawks' movies, he's just so funny and brings all the charm in the world along with his performance. The look of this movie is just too cool, while i'd definitely consider it a film noir it goes in and out depending on the place in the story.

The results were electric and memorable.\n\nSteve \"Harry\" Morgan (bogey) and his drunken first mate, Eddie (Walter Brennan) hire out there fishing boat to tourists in Veechy French Martinique.  Business isn't doing so good, and the owner of the hotel that Steve stays at, \"Frenchy\" Gerard (Marcel Dalio) has been asking him to smuggle some French freedom fighters onto the island.\n\nHe also meets up with Marie \"Slim\" Browning (Bacall) who is basically stuck on the island until she can get up enough money to make passage for home.  Every man in the piano bar has his eyes on her, but somehow she falls for old Steve, who seems most impressed that she can take a slap by Lieutenant Coyo (Sheldon Leonard) of the Veechy Gestapo.\n\nOf course the movie is most famous for the \"You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve?  You just put your lips together and blow.\" scene that makes just about every guy in the audience wet their lips.
