            "content": "In post-World War II Italy poverty is a dire reality for a large portion of the population. Work is scarce and the opportunities for employment are few and far between. \"Ladri Di Biciclette\" (translated \"The Bicycle Thief\") is quietly one of the finest films ever produced. It follows one economically distraught man (Lamberto Maggiorani) who is heading down a desperate path fast. Things look up when he gets a job putting posters on walls in town, but he must sell what few meager possessions he and his family have to buy a bicycle to uphold his end of the business bargain. Naturally tragedy strikes immediately as the title character shows up the very first day Maggiorani is on the job. The police are little help, believing the bicycle is not as important as it really is. Thus Maggiorani and young son Enzo Staiola take it upon themselves to look all over town to try and find the bicycle and bring the thief to justice. \"The Bicycle Thief\" was originally released in 1948 and won an Honorary Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film the following year (the movie was not released in the U.S. until 1949). It is still a production that strikes deep even today. The lengths and desperate measures that some go through is very evident here. Director Vittorio De Sica crafts a film that is much deeper than it appears on the surface. It examines the human condition and questions society, family, law enforcement, alliances and mental anguish perfectly. \"The Bicycle Thief\" is an excellent production that has aged well and allows the viewer to think about many subjects that go beyond ordinary cinematic depths. 5 stars out of 5.",

            "review_title": "Another one to add to my top 50- a delicate study of desperation in post war Italy",
            "content": "Vittorio De Sica's ground/heartbreaking motion picture, The Bicycle Thief, is based on a very simple ideal for a story- man against the elements. In this case the elements are of a society that is often cruel and unforgiving, and that a job in post-war Rome is looked on as the luckiest of good luck charms.Such a man as presented by De Sica is Maggiorani (an actor who really is the type of actor right off the street), a father of a little boy who gets a job putting up movie posters along some walls in Rome. To do this he needs a bicycle, or the job will be lost, and he gets one following a pawning of linen sheets. Very soon though, the bicycle is stolen, and from there a sad downward spiral unravels for the man and his son as they scour the streets for the bicycle. While the score adds basic dramatic tension, everything else on the screen is done to such a pitch of neo-realism it's at times shattering, joyful (scene in the pizzeria the most note-worthy), and with a feeling of day-to-day resonance to those who may have not even felt at or below the poverty level in their lives. Credit due to all parties involved, though I don't think the boy Bruno, played by Staiola, gets nearly enough considering his role as a minor coming of age (that moment after the father and son leave the church nearly brought tears to my eyes).

            "content": "This movie changed my life. It changed it in the sense that after seeing it I developed a life-long passion for Italian films after first seeing it in 1955 when it appeared at a local movie theatre in a revival five years or so after its original appearance. I was only 13 at the time and somewhat of a precocious chooser of what films to go see. I have seen THE BICYCLE THIEF (\"Bicycle Thieves\" in England and plural as well in its original Italian title) hundreds of times since and never tire of it. The fact that the film has almost never been out of circulation since its making and is constantly shown in revivals, festivals and film classes attests to its endurance. Martin Scorsese does a glorious appreciation of it in his documentary on the Italian cinema, IL MIO VIAGGIO IN ITALIA. What makes it so enduring? What is so damn great about the movie? It is not its trenchant portrayal of post-war Italian poverty and misery. Lots of films did that even better. It is not in any sense of real drama, which is very schematic. Nor even the unforgettably truthful acting, that iconic face of pint-sized Enzo Staiola. We get truthful acting and iconic faces all over the place. It is, I believe, its sense of compassion, its sense of poetry. Those are rarer qualities. The movie is compassionate poetry. I don't know if writer Cesare Zavattini or director Vittorio De Sica would have appreciated that phrase. I feel they might have. I feel it is exactly the truth they were after. To be sure, the film is a story of father and little-boy in search of what is lost, a necessity yes, but also a lost dream. The endangered hope for a better life to come challenges this paternal/filial relationship. In that sense, this is a film-poem, God help me, about Everyfather and Everylittleboy. The most chilling moment in the poem occurs when little Bruno sees his father steal, and a tearful horror glazes his face as a god seems to collapse. The most redemptive moment comes shortly thereafter when the boy slips his hand into his father's. That forgiveness is not cheap or facile. It is unassailable and all-comforting. It is a forgiving embrace of Virgilian dignity. For a magnificent instant the father, Antonio, has become the son; Bruno, the son, has become the father. At the end, when they walk off into the Roman crowd, they are as one. I have written many thoughts about this film over the years, including an extended exegesis for a local newspaper. I have programmed it in film series, shown it to film classes, Italian classes. I know the movie. Friends, the movie is not about stolen bicycles, indifferent police, bicycle chop-shop gargoyles, mouth-foaming lowlife, desperate actions by the desperate, or mere journalistic human interest that is gone with tomorrow's edition. Its worth resides in its lyric portrayal of the eternal curative power of love. No small thing.Two addenda: the song being rehearsed at the workers' club Antonio visits to see his friend is called \"Ciccio Formaggio.\" The song being sung and played by the restaurant musicians when Antonio and his son eat together is \"Tummuriata nera,\" about the mulatto offspring of an Italian woman and a black soldier. The lyrics for both songs, in Neapolitan dialect, can be found by Googling the titles. Recordings by Roberto Murolo of both songs are available.",

One man named Ricci who haunts the job lines day after day to provide for his wife and two children, when suddenly his name is called for a well-paying city job.  The only catch is that he needs a bicycle for the job, and he has just pawned his bicycle in order to feed his family.  Thus begins `The Bicycle Thief', Vittorio de Sica's gritty study in realism.  Ricci and his wife sell the sheets off of their beds to get the bicycle back, only to have the bicycle stolen on his first day on the job. In order to keep the job, he and his young son walk around Rome, desperate to find the thief, and more importantly, the bicycle before his next day of work.  de Sica chose non-actors to portray the characters in the film, favoring a further realistic vision by casting amateurs.  The result is remarkable, because the pain and emotions conveyed are so true.  The relationship between father and son is also compelling and endearing, in that for the most part, Ricci treats his son as an equal, letting him in on his innermost thoughts and fears, until the end, when a particular event causes him to be ashamed, and the roles become defined once again.  `The Bicycle Thief' personifies the refreshing fact that European cinema was more daring and also true in their reaction to post-war life.  While America was trying to paint a heavy coat of rosy paint on the times by churning out the saccharine MGM musicals by the dozen, Europe was showing that the effects of a war fought on their home turf did not inspire moments of spontaneously breaking into song, or a choreographed dance number, rather life pretty much sucked, but survival, as difficult and ugly as it can be, is most important.  `The Bicycle Thief' has been a critical favorite for decades, and for good reason.  It is a must-see film for any cinephile.--Shelly",

However, he needs to retrieve his bicycle in the pawn shop but he does not have money. His wife Maria (Lianella Carell) pawns their bed sheets and uses the money to recover the precious bicycle. Antonio envisions a better life for his family with his salary, overtime and benefits. Unfortunately, his bicycle is stolen on the first working day. Antonio and his son Bruno (Enzo Staiola) spend the Sunday chasing the bicycle and the thief on the streets of Rome.\"Ladri di Biciclette\" is a heartbreaking masterpiece of the Italian Neo- Realism and one of the best movies of cinema history ever. This is the third time that I watch this unforgettable film that makes me sad with the desperation of Antonio and his lack of perspective in the end. There are memorable touching scenes, like Bruno eating pizza in the restaurant wearing a torn coat and contrasting with the wealthy family; or the happiness of the clumsy Antonio putting up the poster of Rita Hayworth in \"Gilda\"; or the indecision of Bruno between a dish of soup in the church or chasing the old man with his father; or the shame of Antonio in the end. The DVD released in Brazil by Spectra Nova has good quality of image, subtitles in yellow but no Extras. The DVD released by Vers\u00e1til uses the same matrix of Spectra Nova but with subtitles in white, and it is difficult the reading by the viewer. However, there are many Extras. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"Ladr\u00f5es de Bicicleta\" (\"Thieves of Bicycle\")",

            "review_title": "Heartfelt Drama of Post WWII Poverty a Must-See...",
            "content": "The Italian neo-realist film movement began around the end of WWII with Roberto Rossellini's OPEN CITY in 1946.  It is defined and encapsulated by this striking film directed by Vittorio De Sica.  THE BICYCLE THIEF is the best of a group of films that depicted the hardship and despair that Europeans, specifically Italians, went through after the death and destruction of the war.  The economy was horrible, and the towns and cities were half-destroyed and decaying.  Rome is the location for THE BICYCLE THIEF and De Sica shoots the city in grainy black and white with non-professional actors to get a simple, yet unbearingly emotional point across.  A simple thing such as a bike can be someone's entire world at that time and losing it means doing something irrational or perhaps necessary.The lead in the film is played by Lamberto Maggiorani who seems to be a very good actor.  He is not an actor, however, and maybe this is why the film hits its mark so well and comes across so realistically.  Maggiorani is of this difficult world and his brooding face is a clear indication of this. His job is to plaster film posters up on the walls of buildings all over Rome.  He even hangs a picture that symbolizes the absolute opposite of the misery surrounding him.  Rita Hayworth from GILDA is on the walls all over the city, a sign of joy to some, a representation of their own lowly status to others.When the bicycle is actually stolen, the \"title\" character is sought after by Maggiorani and his young son (Enzo Staiola), a little kid with so much acting ability, you swear this must be a documentary.  A grueling search throughout Rome has the essential parts of the movie, because we see up close the actual people and places the neo-realist film movement came to represent.  It is a small, sad world they live in and the bike has to be found so that they can live.  The father is put to the ultimate test in front of his son.  Will he do the honorable thing or will he do what his mind and heart know is only possible? These are the tense moments of the film's climax.There is a lot of THE BICYCLE THIEF in Benigni's LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL and some obvious comparisons have been drawn because of the father-son relationship. They are worthy of comparison and have equal artistic prowess.  What is different about THIEF is the level of intensity maintained throughout.  I felt the key element was the music by Alessandro Cicognini, a simple horn that plays so tragically that it is a main character in the picture.  What De Sica does here, as well as other neo-realist directors (Rossellini, Fellini), is create for American audiences a powerful counterpoint to what we are used to.  An honest, non-corporate portrait of the struggle for life and self-respect.  THE BICYCLE THIEF is one of the finest films ever made.RATING: 10 of 10",

            "content": "Even if you are merely a moderate fan of cinema you will have at least heard of this film. It has been hailed as a masterpiece for just short of sixty years and has been routinely studied in film classes everywhere. In a sense, it is one of the recognized masterpieces of cinema. And yet, this is not a film in which to pick up obviously great shots like the 360 degree shot in the hotel room in \"Vertigo\" or cuts as good as the jump cut in \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" with which Kubrick transports you from prehistoric ages to an age in which space travel is common in barely a second. This is a subtle, realistic film, and though it looks terrific, it is not flashy. It exists not to excel technically or tell the story of humanity, but simply to tell a story. A simple story which may say more about human nature than any other film in existence.\"Bicycle Thieves\" is about a man in economically depressed post-World War II Italy who is lucky enough to find a job which requires him to use a bicycle as transportation while putting up posters around the city. It's relatively well-paying and almost too good to believe for his family. While on the job his bicycle is stolen, and the rest of the movie tells the story of him and his son attempting to recover the bicycle. In the magnificent final scene Antonio Ricci (the lead character) finds himself tempted to steal a bicycle in order to be able to perform his job. Here we have our 'hero' thinking about doing to someone else what was done to him. There is no black and white in the world, no good and evil. This film does a great job of stating that fact without moralizing and preaching like so many modern films do. This film does not insult your intelligence and I pity those who wanted a third act, or those who wanted more explanation. This film is beautiful and brilliant because it is completely understated. It's realistic. We feel Ricci's desperation and are transported into 1940's Rome as he makes his way through the city's crowded streets, alleyways, churches and brothels.I have no idea how much this film cost to make, but I would be surprised if it was made on a low budget. The location shooting throughout the city is impressive, as is the (again) understated cinematography. De Sica cast non-actors in the lead roles, and I find their performances to be among the most realistic and effective I've ever seen. Alessandro Cigognini's score is a highlight of the film, and I consider the melancholy main theme one of the greatest musical cues I've heard in any film.I enjoy theatricality as much as anyone and I certainly don't dislike Hollywood gloss, but \"Bicycle Thieves\" serves as a jarring reminder of how great a medium film can be. The jarring effect the film had on audiences upon its release (in particular American audiences) is easy to understand viewing the film in 2007 and it escapes my comprehension how anyone can't be completely captivated and enthralled by this masterwork.****/4",

It is considered a great work of the Italian cinema, and looking at it in its 1999 release version, one can see why.\nStructurally, it's a theme and variations, with such a simple, clearly stated main motif that one can identify and follow its mutations with no effort.  DeSica is clearly the fine craftsman here, directing every scene with a beautiful sense of control and balance. His work with young Enzo Staiola (as Bruno) is especially commendable, and he allows then nonprofessionals Lamberto Maggiorani (as Antonio) and Lianella Carell (as Marie) to act in a model of naturalism. \nCarlo Montuori's photography is brilliant, and Antonio Traverso's production design is pungent and atmospheric. Like most \"masterpieces,\" a film-classic score provides emotional depth in a subliminal way: here it's a romantic, Italianesque original composition by Aessandro Cicognini wraps up the entire production.DeSica's career is most impressive, being involved in nealy 200 films, 165 of them as an actor. This film remains one of his greatest achievements.  It seems to be standing the test of time very nicely, too.  It's been criticized, sometimes quite severely, and just continues to bounce back, winning new admirers with each reissue.  The public just won't let \"The Bicycle Thief\" fade away. That alone tends to override any negative factors. It looks like this film is going to be around for quite a while. ###",

            "content": "Some films try to explain multiple aspects of a story or a character by showing several episodes from the character's life. Vittorio De Sica's masterful The Bicycle Thief relies on the power of simplicity to drive home its point. It is a very simple film, relying on film making at its basics. There are no professional actors for us to identify with, but there are plot lines, emotions, and thoughts that no one can help but relate to. Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) has been waiting for a job, but when one finally arrives, he must obtain a bicycle in order to be able to accept the position. His loving and caring wife, Maria (Lianella Carell), hocks the bed sheets in order to be able to afford a bicycle for Antonio. He reports to work as a poster hanger, but while on the job for only a short time, the bike is stolen by a young thief (Vittorio Antonucci). Desperate to get the vehicle back, Antonio seeks the aid of his friend, Baiocco (Gino Saltamerenda), and also receives the help of his devoted son, Bruno (Enzo Staiola). Bruno stays by Antonio's side, no matter what, determined to help his father get back the stolen property. It is a frustrating journey for the father and son, as they receive no help, except that of Baiocco. It seems that no matter what they do, Antonio is left with a fateful decision (shown in one of the most brutally honest scenes in any movie I've ever seen). He must ask himself just how far would he go to put food on the table for his family that he loves so much? There has been controversy over the ending of the film, which I am not going to go into, because it would be cheating you out of a brilliant ending to an extraordinary picture. However, I will say this much - When viewing The Bicycle Thief, ask yourself what you would do in Antonio's situation. What choices would you make? Some of the questions that rise from this film are some of the questions that help us to define ourselves as people, and the fact that this film provides such a clear and honest representation of so many facts of life is what makes it an undeniable masterpiece! This is a film to be cherished!",

Nonetheless, it does often irritate the cynic in me that we're teaching a generation of kids that there is a distinct borderline between 'good' and 'evil', between 'justice' and 'injustice', that there exists such a thing as a 'hero', when in reality there is actually nothing of the sort.Ladri di Biciclette is a shining example of a film that demonstrates this fact. There is no distinction between the 'good guys' and the 'bad guys'. At times we support one character, or the others. But there is never a line drawn between one side or the other because in reality, the only people we see here are simply human - flawed, corruptible and in this case, all suffering the same tragic fate. Our central character Antonio is obviously the protagonist, and he is obviously portrayed in such a way that our sympathies lie with him, but he is far from being a hero. He is simply used as the representation of the tragic misfortune that can befall mankind. This misfortune, also, is not depicted in any black-and-white sense. Antonio and his family's plight is not the only, or even necessarily the most desperate, in this film. In fact, with the exception of the family in the restaurant scene, practically every single character, major or minor, is portrayed as suffering in some way at the hands of capitalism.Therefore, as obviously tragic as Antonio's story is, the only real reason we side with him is because his particular tragedy is centrally focused. But, as has been discussed so often previously, he is an Everyman character. The bicycle in the film is simply used as an analogy for the loss, or lack of any essential element of life that leads to poverty and suffering. In very simple terms, the film's message is essentially that at some stage in life, we are all shouting \"Give me back my bicycle!\" But I digress. This simplistic and amateurish film is far more real and far more true-to-life than practically anything that Hollywood has churned out in the past fifty years. For that reason, the realist in me believes that all those dreamers, people who believe in a happy ending or ideal status quo, could do with the sort of down-to-earth lesson that this film represents.Yes, it's a distressing and bleak vision. But nevertheless, an utterly profound one.",

            "content": "Semantically speaking, self-realization is a probable prelude to catharsis, but at a much higher echelon of cognition the two become virtually inseparable as attaining the former would automatically yield the latter. At this threshold of enlightenment, human spirit attains a sense of ephemeral divinity that would either drive the human crazy or would lead him to salvation. This enlightenment can seldom be attained through vicarious means. Even cinema, with its unparalleled potential to stimulate and satiate, mostly falls short of being cathartic, and only in the rarest of the rare cases does it manage to accomplish the incredible and the extraordinary. Undoubtedly, Bicycle Thieves is one such rare moment of triumph, wherein cinema becomes not only the tool but also the medium for the viewer to attain eternal salvation. Bicycle Thieves is an Italian neo-realist film by Vittorio De Sica. Neo- realism, a naturalistic movement in Italian cinema of the 1940s, aimed at giving cinema a new degree of realism, which promoted the use of an amateur cast vis-\u00e0-vis a professionally trained one and advocated shooting at real locations instead of the custom-built sets & studios. Keeping up with the spirit of the movement, Vittorio De Sica chose a factory fitter who had brought his son along for an audition as his male lead. His lead actress was a journalist who had approached him for an interview, while the young boy was filled by a child spotted in the crowd watching the filming. Bicycle Thieves tells the story of a poor worker searching the streets of Rome for his stolen bicycle, which he needs to keep his job intact. The movie is an amalgam of contrasting human feelings of hope & despair, sacrifice & gratification, euphoria & melancholy, love & detestation, and malice & benevolence. Bicycle Thieves performs the central function of art, which is to discover the meaning of life. The movie brilliantly handles with utmost care and precision the tender and often painful relationship that universally exists between a father and a son. The later half of the movie presents cinema at its most vivid, vituperative and volatile culminating in one of the most impactful, melancholic and brutally humanistic finales ever filmed in cinematic history, the agony of which would keep the viewer contemplating for weeks, months, or even years. The screenplay is simplistic, thought-provoking and at times nakedly brutal, while the cinematography is so effortless and magnificently beautiful that it appears as though a soul of a man has been filmed, and its true essence has been captured and preserved. The poignancy of the background score casts such a sustained spell that the movie experience is enhanced beyond imagination. American playwright Arthur Miller called it a lyrical masterpiece as it examines openly the destructive and draconian world man has made for himself. Marlon Brando once said, \"Bicycle Thieves is the perfect example of what can be done in front of the motion picture camera and is so rarely done\". Academy winner, Henry Fonda was so moved by the movie that he was tempted to write Vittorio De Sica a fan letter. The film is frequently on critics' and directors' lists of the best films ever made. It has captured every honor that the world of film can bestow including an Academy Honorary Award in 1950.All these accolades and the ubiquitous acclaim cannot describe the actual experience of seeing this film and becoming a part of its emotional impact. It makes the viewer laugh, cry and experience a rainbow of emotions. Bicycle Thieves has withstood the test of time for over six decades, and is a film for anyone and everyone.PS. It is a cinematic magnum opus, which accentuates the true might of cinema, and is a must for everyone, irrespective of cast, color, creed or gender. It's an ageless cinema for people of all age groups. 10/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",

            "content": "The grim reality of post-war Italian life is immediately apparent in this film, as a group of unemployed men all crowd around in the morning, desperate to have their name called out for possible job opportunities. One man is lucky enough to get one putting up advertising posters, but his fortunes are soon reversed when his bike is stolen, thus setting off a desperate search around Rome with his son.So much of this man's pain - the humiliation of the situation he's in and the fear for his family's future - is amplified because of the presence of his son, which was a brilliant part of the story. He's needed to pawn items to feed his family. The police give him an apathetic, helpless response when he reports the crime. As he searches he gets help from friends, but it's like trying to find a needle in a haystack, despite seeing the machinations of a stolen bicycle racket on open display in a market. As he frantically runs around, a creepy guy talks to his son, and appears to be preying on him. Later he splurges on wine and mozzarella sandwiches, but his son can't help but notice what affluent kids are eating. Most dangerously, we feel the threat of an angry mob when he thinks he's found the culprit. What we see again and again is a harsh, unjust world, and all of this is being reflected in the boy's eyes.In the film's most gripping scene, the man faces the question, to what lengths should he go for his family? I felt great empathy for him, despite what seemed like a little carelessness on his part for his bike (and son!), considering how important they are to him. The feeling is magnified when director Vittorio De Sica shows us a huge rack of pawned items early on, and later in that brilliant crowd scene at the end, both of which made me think that this is just one story of many, that there is so much suffering in tough times, and most of it we're completely unaware of. There seems to be allegory here, as his bicycle has been stolen, so the future appeared to have been stolen for Italians in the 1940's. It's a small moment when the man gets a little break from a stranger, but this forgiving gesture carries tremendous meaning for the film, as does the moment the son takes his hand to move forward, together. Brilliant and haunting.",

            "content": "Many films that were made more than 40-50 years ago are difficult to watch at times. Not because they are low-quality, but because the storytelling techniques were different, and in this case, the subject matter was just an overall downer. Now, I have adapted to watching foreign films. There was a time when I didn't like the subtitles side to those films, but I've seen so many now that I don't really even think about it. So my opinions on the film reflect nothing to do with the fact that it's a foreign film, or old for that matter. But I have to say, I didn't really think Bicycle Thieves was as good as the critics have rated it, or good enough to be on one of the all-time greatest films list.There's nothing bad about the film though, it's a unique story about a family in war-time Italy and the struggles that everyone went through in finding a job at that time. These people had no choice but to work, and they had to work jobs that they may not have been pleased with. I liked that part of the movie. They did a great job at making believe that this was a place where a bicycle could get stolen just like that. But to be honest I never found the full story to be all that interesting. The kid tries to throw in some comedic relief and dramatic depth to the role but some of it falls pretty flat. But I did get a little bit of that Life is Beautiful vibe from their relationship at times, that much I liked.The problem with the film is that I didn't care enough about the characters to feel something when the going got rough. For the most part, our lead character is pretty unlikable and doesn't do enough to make himself appealing anyway. The acting is fine, the film looks fine, and the directing is fine, but that's not good enough. I found too many things in the film to just be average.+Set up the world nicely +Acting is fine -Kid's performance is iffy-Didn't feel special 6.5/10",

            "content": "THE BICYCLE THIEVES is an Italian \"Neo-realist\" film--so called because it used real people in rather ordinary situations. Some see these as anti-Hollywood but the actual reason for them was that after the war, the Italian film industry was in ruin and they were practically broke, so making these simple films about simple people was a natural outgrowth, though some of the groundwork for this style began during the war.The story itself is about a poor man who is out of work but is finally able to secure a job using his bicycle. The problem is that soon after starting back to work, the bike is stolen so he spends the rest of the film searching for the bike (sort of like PEEWEE'S GREAT ADVENTURE, but not a comedy). Later in the film, the focus is not just on the bike but on the relationship between the man and his young son. There really is nothing more to this very simple plot, but it is a fascinating time capsule into the desperate state of Italy until its rebirth in the mid-1950s.The fact that THE BICYCLE THIEVES is so well known and respected is a testament to the fact that many \"in the know\" aren't really that smart after all. What they actually didn't realize is that the director (DeSica) did several other films that were at least as good, if not better. I have heard and read much fawning praise for this film while at the same time wondering how these critics can discuss THE BICYCLE THIEVES without mentioning his other great works. It wasn't like THE BICYCLE THIEVES was his one crowning achievement as director--it's just that this one was discovered abroad and by the Oscar people (AMPAS). I challenge you to watch MIRACLE IN MILAN, UMBERTO D or especially THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US and then tell me that THE BICYCLE THIEVES is THE great masterpiece. These films (particularly THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US) have a great depth of emotion that THE BICYCLE THIEVES lacks and the connection to the audience is greater (provided you ever see these other films).I am not cursing THE BICYCLE THIEVES--it is a very good and simple film. But as far as its being a \"masterpiece\", I just think it's a bit overrated. Before marking this review \"not helpful\", please first have integrity and see these other films to see what I mean--they are indeed great films and DeSica was an amazing director.",

            "content": "Ladri Di Biciclette. Ranked as one of the most influential and inspirational films of all-time. At one point, was deemed the greatest film of all time. An extensive list of self-proclaimed accolades that has assured its position in cinematic history. The question inevitably was whether or not Bicycle Thieves was indeed that perfect post-war drama many claimed it to be. Aside from one glaring character action that didn't particularly sit well with me, I must confess that after some deliberation I came to the conclusion that this drama is technically flawless. Flabbergasting on occasion. The sheer complexity of its simple story is nothing short of genius from De Sica. A working class father searches the entirety of Rome in order to find his recently stolen bicycle, an essential equipment that was to be the salvation of his family.Post-war and post-fascist, this minimalistic story arguably presents some of the best interpretations of humanistic values in both classic and modern cinema. There are so many themes tackled through De Sica's visualised direction, that the essence of realism surpasses that of neorealism. A story so relatable, dealing with poverty and a wealth class system, that it borders the boundaries of experimentalism.A cast of non-actors running around the impoverished streets of urban Rome, where citizens recuperate from the burning chaos that ensued from the war. De Sica's wide angled shots that capture the fragility and hostility of Italy. Neighbourhoods imparting their falsified honesty with threatening behaviour. The criminal act of desperation when all seems lost. An honest soul filled with anguish. A delicate father and son relationship that relishes in humanism, embellishing moral values. Montuori's cinematography capitalising on the urban disarray. Cicognini's score beautifully exhuming Italian Renaissance. Da Roma's sharp editing eloquently transitioning each scene, stringing them along into the most humble of stories. Only for it to all end on a melancholic note.De Sica commences the story with an assured layer of optimism, only for life to unfortunately unravel and crush that sense of hope. Despite Bartolini including various lines of comedic flair, the tale itself remains grounded. Maggiorani is a natural performer. His character's desperation is conveyed simply through his facial expressions and frantic body movement. Staiola, who plays his son, was exceptional. Possibly one of the best child performances I've seen. The constant staring towards his father shows the endearment and loyalty that presides in him. Exceptional.My only criticism, and it comes down to a personal opinion, is when Antonio slaps his son and doesn't apologise for it. Sure, treating him to a fancy pizzeria may act as a symbolic apology, whilst also showcasing the wealth disparity even further. But it didn't sit well with me. Understandably, it conveyed his frustration and desperation for his lost bicycle, however his son really did not do anything to deserve that. It was at that precise moment I was more invested in the son than I was with him. The recovered film was also a tiny bit rough around the edges, yet never detracted from the experience.My first endeavour into Italian neorealism was a success. No doubt. The environment and story that De Sica presented was scathingly realistic and relatable, all weighed down by superb natural performances. The themes and context are all hiding in the crevices of Rome, and Bicycle Thieves beautifully illustrates that. A simple tale that has the velocity of the Giro d'Italia. Stunning.",

Perhaps the best film ever made. Thank God for TCM and Robert Osbourn. Together they have brought obscure masterpieces right into our living rooms so that we can discover the global genius that is film making around the world. The Bicycle Thief is about desperation in post WWII Italy. After a man wins the job lottery putting up posters of Rita Hayworth around Rome, on his first day at work his only essential tool of trade, his bicycle, is stolen. What ensues to the end of the movie is a desperate, tension filled, search for the thief who stole it, and ultimately the recovery of his bicycle. He is accompanied on his search by his 7 year old son. The two actors who play these roles are not professional actors and yet they turn in performances of the century. The plot points, direction, writing, and cinematography, of this masterpiece are without equal. The portrayal of the misery and desperation of those who survived WWII leaves a pit in your stomach. Most profound is the relationship between the father and son and their journey together to find his stolen bicycle so that he can make money and feed his family again. This is a movie without a climax. And that's a big part of what makes it great. The ending is something you could never imagine, and will never forget once you've experienced it. I will only say one more thing about it's conclusion. There are some things more heartbreaking than the tragic loss of life. In this movie, that \"something more heartbreaking than the tragic loss of life\", is the tragedy of continuing to live after you've lost everything. This is the saddest film I have ever seen and that includes Old Yeller and Where the Red Fern Grows. But it is a magnificent film and should be seen by everyone. It has left a mark on me that will never go away. And in every respect, it very well could be one of the greatest film ever made.",

What makes me love Bicycle Thieves so much is the emotional impact. It is an incredibly touching movie, especially at the end which is so harsh and pessimistic yet very real that I can't help getting choked. It is not just the ending that is so achingly poignant, it is also the ironic humanism Bicycle Thieves has, and the film is also chilling in the scene when Bruno sees his father steal and redemptive in when Bruno slips his hand into his father's. Aside from the poignancy, the film is incredibly well made, with stunning photography, wondrous scenery and poetic symbolism. Alessandro Cicognini's score brings a dramatic intensity to the proceedings as well, and the Italian songs are wonderful. The script is both thought-provoking and philosophical(you live and you suffer), and the story follows or adopts a flow-of-life structure. The pace I have no problem with either, it is drawn-out but it is so deliberately to add to the neo-realism. Vittorio Di Sica directs impeccably and the acting is pretty much outstanding with Enzo Staiola delivering one of the most heart-breakingly believable child performances I have seen especially. All in all, a masterpiece. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The acting by a cast of first-time actors is nothing more than average, although the little boy is adorable. Maggiorani looks like a cross between Humphrey Bogart and Clint Eastwood!

The final scene is about as gut wrenching as anything ever put on film. It is not sentimental as some say; it is painful. We have a man of great morals driven by forces over which he has no control, but that isn't going to matter. The options are starvation and abandonment. It's interesting how the crowds that judge this man counter the efforts he has made. The film is grueling and despairing. The thing is that it is so human.

He had pawned his bicycle, but by giving up the family linens, he gets it back, only to have it stolen on the first day at work. He, his son, and several friends go to great lengths to help the man find his stolen bicycle, without results. Eventually the man resorts to becoming a bicycle thief himself.I have never seen anyone so ashamed, as this man was, when his son witnesses the humiliation of seeing his father caught stealing and mobbed for his offense. I was also stunned by seeing the size of the pawnshop (it looked like an Amazon warehouse!), as well as a \"bicycle fence yard\" that was enormous. During poor economic times pawnshops and \"fences\" seem to be the only ones flourishing.This is a stunning motion picture achievement. The poor film quality (suffering considerably after some 50 years) only adds to the authenticity. \"The Bicycle Thief\" is one of the finest films I have viewed.

Francesco Ricci gets a job for which he must have a bicycle, his bicycle is pawned, so his wife has to pawn all their sheets (6) to get money to get out the bicycle. One of the most impressing scenes in the film is about these sheets: the six sheets are bundled up in a parcel which is stored together with other parcels of sheets, but the shelves of these stored parcels stretch higher and higher, and her sheets have to be placed on top, for which the clerk must climb a ladder of considerable height - you get the impression of her sheets geeting lost in a crowd of other pawned sheets, and that's also what the main characters are doing in this film - they get lost in an unfathomable Kafka process of hopelessness and impossibilities.Vittorio de Sica was perhaps the most human of all cinema directors, in every film he focuses on humanity, the human factor and its problems with a world of inhumanity, and this tendency is especially clear in this film, where the centre of attention is on the small boy, who without being the leading character nevertheless is the chief communicator of this film's message - a maze of destiny with no way out, marked by a constantly increasing degree of tragedy and despair. The film answers no questions, there is no end and least of all any solution to the problem, it just leads you there and shows the case and leaves to the audience to remain upset forever.",

I think critics and people keep praising it for one of two reasons: they don't understand it and think they're missing something (but don't want to admit it) OR don't want to rock the boat of critical opinions from the 1940s. Overrated, depressing and ultimately pointless.",

            "content": "This is another one of those \"Top 100 Films\" (or top 250, whatever) that is very overrated and will always be overrated because critics don't have the guts to ever change their lifelong opinions of anything, or go against their peers. In other words, it's the \"thing to do,\" meaning rate some films higher than they deserve. It's almost an elitist-type of attitude among critics. Maybe it makes them feel smart. It's always been \"in,\" too, among North American critics to overrate these European films. That, too, somehow makes this Liberal morons feel intelligent. They do this with Kurosawa, Bergman, Tarkovsky, Truffaut and others. In this case, it's director Vittorio De Sica.The fact is this is a grimy, unappealing, boring movie. The story is a simple one (not that there's anything wrong with that!): a man needs a bicycle to get a job. His wife pawns some things to help him buy a bike. After he gets it, it's stolen and the rest of the film is the man trying to find it. It was NOT fascinating; it was boring.Sometimes great camera-work elevates a film way above the story, or great acting will do that, but there is nothing extraordinary about anything in this movie. The actors are literally amateurs and look and sound the part.Yes, this movie can bring emotion and frustration as the feeble man and his son search desperately for the bike. Yes, I can see where this would be a \"touching\" film for some. Some parts are nicely filmed, too, It isn't all bad, but it's nowhere near its reputation as one of the top classic movies of all time. Come on! Get real!",

            "content": "Lamartine, a French writer and poet said once : \"Sometimes, when one person is missing, the whole world seems depopulated\", I guess in the case of \"Bicycle Thieves\", Vittorio De Sica's gripping masterpiece of neo-realism, one can say that sometimes, when one object is missing, the whole world seems totally unlivable.The story is simple, as it often is for the greatest films. It's about a man named Ricci, who just got a job in a post-War unemployment-stricken Roma. The community's hopelessness weakened its fraternal spirit as illustrated by these human queues protesting when only one's got a job. And that day seems to be Ricci's day : he will start working as a hanger-poster, all he needs is a bicycle. Having just pawned his, Ricci's reaction quickly betrays him, but from the crowd's opportunistic cries, he realizes he'd better shut his mouth and do the best to get his bicycle back.The film relevantly alternates between social commentary and family drama, through a powerful depiction of the solidarity that could only prevail within the family in these times. The wife, Maria, without hesitation strips the sheets from the marital bed : they would replace the bicycle in the pawn shop. The never ending shot of the man climbing the ladder full of other used sheets, is a strong reminder of the hardship endured in these days where even sheets were secondary.In another interesting scene, Ricci waits for Maria who visits a Wise Woman. Impatiently enthusiastic, he joins her upstairs while asking two kids to watch the bicycle. Maria came to pay for the prediction that Ricci would get a job, but he prevents her from 'wasting her money', as a practical man. However, when you measure the length of the human queue that visits the Wise woman, you understand how far from practicality people could be pushed by despair, while superstition was the only guidance one could seek. Ricci didn't need that, he had a job. On many levels, the scene is interesting, as we wonder if Ricci's intervention could have foreshadowed the theft, expecting from the title and the misleading cheerful mood, that the bicycle would be stolen when he'll come downstairs. But this would have been too predictable.The following day, Ricci rides his bicycle, carrying a ladder. Every time we get to see him on a bicycle, there's a sensation of freedom, driven by an exhilarating fast motion. But fate chose Ricci as the unfortunate victim of a meticulously set-up stealing. We only have a quick glance on the thief, but Ricci's reaction sweeps it off, and sets up the dramatic element that will never desert the film. Ricci knows what this terrible loss means. He comes back by bus, ignoring the queue, and peoples' protests. The next day, starts a long quest for the stolen bicycle with Ricci and his son, Bruno, a plucky funny-looking little boy, who makes the duo look like a dramatic reminiscence of Chaplin and his Kid, with a new father-and-son dimension that will be the heart of the film.And in this journey that immortalized the Roma that was just healing its War hounds, queues take a particular significance as an allegory of Ricci's condition: a man isolated in his own despair struggling against a system that makes an outcast of him, or worse, an agitator. In a church, Ricci 'harasses' the only man he previously flashed with the stealer, unluckily frail and old. After a long unsuccessful search, Ricci almost wisely resigns and takes Bruno to the restaurant. For a brief moment, Ricci smiles again and lets Bruno drink a few wine. The restaurant scene represents a pivotal moment when Bruno realizes his personal contrast with the richer kid who can eat spaghetti, and Ricci reconsiders with a mathematical precision how providential and indispensable were the job and the bicycle.Ricci's only chance is superstition, an euphemism for luck. \"Find it now, or it'll be lost forever\" the Wise Woman implacably says. And in an unpredictable twist, Ricci meets the thief, right after the visit and he's the one, as his defensive reaction shows. Ricci violently gets him off a brothel, with the fierceness of a man who won't let his prey escape. De Sica's direction is masterful as it makes Ricci, following the tragic irony that governed his journey, look like a bully to the people of the neighborhood and the epileptic stroke of the suspected kid made Ricci even more detestable.Ricci endured hostility, he lost his bicycle and his pride, he faces a situation where his heart is full of hatred and where he has nothing to lose. If a thief can get through this, so be it. Tortured by his conscience, he finally asks Bruno to take the tram and steals a bicycle parked in a cleared place. But this is not Ricci's day at all, and the climactic sequence after making my heart pound, literally melted it when the by-standers stopped Ricci and started treating him like a bug, with the sad and tear-jerking cries of poor Bruno that saved him from jail, but not from the insults.De Sica deliberately hired non-professionals as to amplify the film's neo-realistic aspect. I couldn't believe it as Lamberto Maggiorani's face embodies to perfection the raw and brutal condition of an average man facing an unfair hostility. And as he walked hand in hand with poor Bruno into the sunset, with Alessandro Cicognini's penetrating score, two things cuts straight into my heart : first, I had just watched one of the saddest but greatest dramas ever. Secondly, considering the father-and-son relationship, Bruno learned in one day what it took to be a man with responsibilities, and how cruel the world could be, so maybe the only light of hope is that despite everything, Bruno still loved and respected his father",

These days, I like nothing better than popping a Bergman or Kurosawa or Ozu movie into my DVD player, and I'm becoming more and more intolerant of crass Hollywood fare.Bear with me, because my tedious introductory comments are leading up to a point. And that point is - \"Bicycle Thieves\" is perhaps THE essential movie that turned me off foreign films for so many years. \"Bicycle Thieves\" is, in sad fact, the movie that chased me away from subtitles, away from the arty-farty world of elite cinema. It took a long time for me to work up the courage to watch another foreign film after I saw this little gem, I can tell you.But why, you might reasonably ask, did \"Bicycle Thieves\" have such a profoundly negative effect on me? Because I found it simply too depressing for words. Depressing...to an almost absurd degree.The movie, I'm sure you know, is about a dude who needs a bicycle to get a decent job and support his family. He pawns some of his last worldly possessions in order to obtain said bicycle. And the bicycle is *immediately* stolen. Our protagonist spends the whole movie trying to get the bicycle back, and even succeeds in tracking down the thief, but he is obstructed at every turn by jerks and ultimately frustrated in his quest.So, in the end, our hero tries to steal a bicycle himself during a moment of despair. Unfortunately for him, about 10,000 people witness the attempted theft and perform a group tackle on him to stop it. He is publicly shamed in front of his son, and then slinks away. End of depressing movie.What exactly is the message here? Society sucks? Poverty is inescapable? Don't respond to stealing with more stealing? Or, at least, never try to lift someone else's bike when 10,000 people are ready to spring upon you from every doorway and stop you? The truth is, I can't figure out the movie's message. Nor can I relate much to the depths of poverty shown here - can the guy really not afford to buy another bicycle, or borrow one, or *something*? Or must his whole life be an endless tale of frustration and woe? Call me superficial...call me bourgeois...call me uninformed...but I think this movie is just a drag, a slog, a pain in my posterior. It's the kind of foreign movie that turns Americans off better foreign movies, and that's a shame. I wish I could see something sophisticated about it, but I don't - what's so sophisticated about being relentlessly dark, to the point of stretching credibility? In short, I'll gladly take the bitter-sweetness of a foreign art film like \"Tokyo Story\" over the bitter-bitterness of this one. Real life is usually better than what you see in this movie, folks. And when life does get this bad...I'm not sure I wanna look at it.",

            "content": "Vittorio De Sica's masterpiece of small creations and grand results has made this movie something that really needs as much viewing as 'Citizen Kane' and 'It's a Wonderful Life'. It was not the first film of Italian Neo-realism nor the last, but its survival and timelessness must say something.Two things caused the Italian Neo-realism movement. First was all the big scale films getting silly and stale, so something more serious and relatable was needed. Second was at the end of the second World War, much of Europe was left in poverty, so films of such degrees as before were unable to be done. So De Sica shot on location with minimal tools and cast blue-collar people (not actual actors) to play the people needed. The protagonist named Lamberto Maggiorani had a hard-job that paid little and recently got laid off and had been trying to find work ever since. Following this movie, he was occasionally cast in De Sica's future works. His son in the movie played by Enzo Staiola was cast after De Sica saw him helpings father. The rest is history.Italy was hit pretty hard after World War II since they were under the command of Mussolini. What we see is a worn-down Rome and 90% of its population trying to get jobs. Lamberto Maggiorani plays protagonist and hero Antonio Ricci who out of luck gets a well-paying job putting up posters along Rome. The only catch is he needs to supply a bicycle. That is in his job description or else he cannot be employed by them. He sells some fabrics at home and finally gets it. We, the audience feel so relieved. First day on the job, some punk youth steals it. The rest of the film is Antonio and his son Bruno trying their hardest to find it and put their lives back on track.Part adventure and mystery, Antonio seeking his possession is pretty thrilling. We know exactly who he is and exactly what's on the line. And not knowing who took it or where it is makes the movie very exciting. But this is best remembered for its serious side. This is a movie about the bonds between father and son. Bruno is a child who should not have to worry about his dad's hardships. But together, they travel all around Rome searching for the one thing that his father needs: a bicycle. Should Antonio steal another one or fraudulently claim one? See what happens.These characters are as real now as they were then. Many people these days struggle to make ends meet and get screwed over. 'Bicycle Thieves' shows how labour was back in the days and place where it was almost obsolete. Anything different to this perfect picture (apparently they were thinking about casting Cary Grant as Antonio) and the realism would have been lost and the knockout power would be gone. Watch this timeless picture and never forget what it does to you.4/4",

            "content": "This was one of the few remaining well-known classic films which I hadn't seen before joining this HoF. I was a bit worried that it wouldn't live up to its reputation, but fortunately, it ended up blowing me away.I noticed that some people here criticized how Antonio grows more and more unlikable as the film progresses, but I think that was actually the point of his character. Watching him slowly lose his humanity by acting forceful with the various people he encounters while the chances of him reclaiming his stolen bicycle kept diminishing was quite tragic. During his attempts to reclaim his stolen bicycle, he acts forceful with an elderly man, he rudely disrupts a church sermon, he slaps his son, and he acts forceful with a young boy and potentially causes him to have a seizure. I found the ending to be a powerful culmination to his arc as it showed how much the events of that day had changed him and lowered his morals.The excellent twin performances from Lamberto Maggiorani (Antonio) and Enzo Staiola (Bruno) enhance the film's emotional core. Maggiorani is able to transmit so much of the desperation and hopelessness he experiences in the film through his facial expressions. Equally impressive is Staiola's performance. Despite being only 9 years old when this film was released and not having many lines, he reflects both the increasing desperation his father feels as the film progresses in addition to the direct and indirect pain his father causes him throughout the film onto his face. I found the final scene to be quite heartbreaking, in part due to the thematic implications of it and also due to the facial expressions from both actors.While the emotional core to the film is compelling, this film is a lot more than just a story about a stolen bicycle. It's also a bleak portrait of the poverty which many Italians faced post-World War II. We see some immediate effects of this like crowds of people desperately trying to get jobs, people shoving past each other to get on buses, and people selling their personal possessions to get a job. The film also explores the various ways people coped with poverty, like resorting to thievery, falsely claiming they could see the future by becoming a fortune teller, or being a prostitute. Most of these effects weren't explored in much detail and were instead treated as backdrops to the main action, but they got under my skin regardless and made the film's scope both epic and intimate at the same time. In the chaotic, poverty stricken city shown in the film, Antonio's bicycle means everything to him and it's clear how vital it is that he reclaims it.",

But hate it I do, hate, hate, hate, and I sincerely look forward to never seeing it again. When I find myself so hating a movie that the rest of the world adores, my standard procedure is to give it one star, just to balance things. But in truth, this movie was so well made that I couldn't in good conscience give it only one star. So I gave it two.\"What's he talking about? How can he admit it's a terrifically made movie and yet hate it so much?\" I hate it for it's message. I hate it for its point of view. I hate it for what it has to say, no matter how skillfully and artfully it says it. And it's not until we get to the ending that this message really becomes clear.The message is one of hopelessness. Grim, grinding, depressing hopelessness. This movie is absolutely steeped in a malevolent universe premise. Everything sucks and there's nothing you can do about it.The protagonist is a very likable guy. He clearly loves his wife and children and is trying his very best to somehow provide for them. When he manages to get his bicycle out of hock so that he can get the super-rare job, you exult with him that he's finally going to be able to make some money and feed his family. Of course, the unfortunate title of the film already leads you into instant stress over his situation, because you already *know* the bicycle, essential for his success, is going to be stolen (and you don't have to get very far into the film to realize that the title is probably going to end up applying just as much to himself, that he too is going to end up stealing a bicycle). And sure enough, on his very first day on the job, the bicycle is stolen. Now his only option is to try to find and retrieve the bicycle, a practically hopeless, impossible task. But one that could certainly be the core of an interesting, engrossing film story.And it *is* an interesting and engrossing film story. I was totally caught up in it. I really felt for the guy, and wanted him to succeed. I felt for him, I felt for his kid, I felt for his brave, steadfast wife. Like I said, the hero is likable. He doesn't give up, he doesn't despair, he keeps plugging away, and, against all odds, he *does* manage to find the thief! And yet... it's all for nothing. Because this isn't a movie about triumph, about success, it's a movie about failure. Because finding the thief doesn't help, he proves to be untouchable, the police can do nothing. With every other avenue exhausted, at the end of his rope, he does indeed try to steal a bicycle himself, but he can't even succeed at that. The movie ends with him walking away, a completely shattered, broken man.Well what kind of an ending is that?!? I watched the whole movie pulling for the guy, waiting for him to succeed *somehow*, and in the end, the message is, \"Sorry, success is impossible, life is a stacked deck, there's no reason to even try.\" What kind of message is that?!? First off, it's depressing as hell, and I don't watch movies to be depressed. Second, it's a premise I strenuously reject. Life is NOT hopeless, the universe is NOT malevolent, happiness and success ARE possible.One of the most useful things I've ever read on this site is a thread in the discussion section about whether the message of the film is intended to be Marxist. I confess that one of my reactions was that it did seem vaguely Marxist, or at least anti-capitalist. But the thread makes a good case that it really wasn't Marxist at all; indeed the communist guys in the film are no help at all. Nothing is any help. This movie is Anti-. Anti-everything. Capitalism clearly doesn't work, communism doesn't, religion doesn't help, government (in the form of the police) doesn't help. A loving wife, a dedicated friend, nothing helps. This is a horribly nihilistic, depressing philosophy. Apparently the only thing that the movie makers believe in is making artistic movies.I suspect that the movie makers thought it was chic, or sophisticated, or artistic to be anti-everything. Well, not in my book. You have to be *for* *something*. But in one limited respect, I'll buy into their anti-everything philosophy: I'm anti-this film.",

It also served as a source of inspiration for many of the greatest films of the twentieth century. Some of the films depict events as they occurred during the war. Others, such as this exceptional film, portray the very tragic consequences of the war during its aftermath on the people who were most impacted by it, in this instance the people of Italy's capital city, Rome. This is among three of my favorite films directed by Vittorio De Sica. The other two are \"Umberto D\" and \"Two Women\". All three films powerfully express the human suffering endured by the people of Italy as a result of the war.The fact that the three leading characters are played so ably by amateur actors is yet one more confirmation of De Sica's outstanding directing talent. Lamberto Maggiorani as Antonio, the father, Enzo Staiola as Bruno, his eight year old son, and Lianella Carell as Maria, his wife, present very credible performances from start to finish.The story is a very simple one about a man who depends upon a bicycle for the livelihood of his family in a post-war Rome that is plagued by rampant unemployment and poverty. On the very first day of his new job, he becomes distracted for a few moments by his new responsibilities, and the bicycle is stolen with no hope for his ability to purchase a new one. As the father and his young search for the stolen bicycle through the devastated streets of Rome, we experience a steady backdrop of a city struggling to survive in an environment of severe economic hardship. While the crowds and the rickety city busses, packed with riders, appear to create an authentic scene, it is De Sica's amazing directorial skills and hard work that make the ruinous atmosphere so real to us. The haunting music of Alessandro Cicognini, who also partnered with De Sica for \"Umberto D\", significantly contributes to the overall atmosphere of sorrow and despair.As a side note, in 1974 when I was a low level federal employee in Washington DC, my only practical means of transportation, a bicycle, was stolen when the thieves sawed off the wooden post to which it was chained. At a time of frequent, violent crime that plagued our own nation's capitol city, the DC police couldn't be bothered any more than the police of Rome in this film. They were too preoccupied with matters more urgent than the loss of my own livelihood. Thankfully, I was not forced to suffer the humiliation that Antonio must endure in front of his young son at the end of this movie, a scene that I will never forget.",

This story takes us to the ravaged city of Rome following World War II, with impoverished citizens desperately seeking work to provide for their families. The casual viewer will not be prepared for the desperation Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) will eventually face in attempting to recover the bicycle he needs to perform the job he has just been hired for, that of putting up posters throughout the city. Ricci is accompanied by his son Bruno (Enzo Staiola), hopeful and naive enough to believe that the family's fortunes are about to improve.Complaints that the film is slow in getting started and depressing as it relates to the search for the stolen bike probably misses the point. This is a story of the human condition, certainly rooted in circumstance of time and place, yet capturing the essence of what a person must do to forge ahead to be a productive person, at least for himself if not for the greater society. Antonio's prospects are tempered by the grim scale of his mission, the search for a single bike in a massive city, almost on the scale of looking for a needle in a haystack. The son appears to symbolize the hope and trust he places in a father to do right by his family, who will be rewarded with a successful outcome.I was intrigued by director De Sica's infrequent use of humorous moments to lighten the film's burden - Bruno's interrupted attempt to relieve himself, his disturbance of the priest in the confessional, eating the mozzarella sandwich. These small moments temporarily distract us from the father's daunting task.It will eventually become clear to the perceptive viewer that because the title is plural, there will eventually be more than one perpetrator. One senses the father's shame and humiliation when he resorts to the same tactic that caused his desperation in the first place. The film's redemptive moment occurs when the son takes the father by the hand with love and understanding, a moment of compassion and forgiveness that closes out the film on a more hopeful note than a depressing one.",

            "content": "Possible Spoilers One of the simplest movies ever made, yet one of the most poignant. Of particular note is the title of the film, which serves, in retrospect, to illustrate deSicca's main point. In English, the singular title \"The Bicylce Thief\" causes the viewer to question who really is the bicycle thief in the movie? It is logical to conclude that the title refers to the main character, whom the film closely chronicles. But to call the hopeless, dejected character, with whom the viewer has empathized for the entire movie, a thief would be ludicrous, unless- by calling such a man a \"thief\"- deSicca is making a more powerful commentary on an inability to define a person or his actions as absolutely good or absolutely evil- the two terms are not mutually exclusive, as there is a blurring between the two that occurs when other factors are considered. The title serves as a reminder that not all criminals are evil- some have been motivated out of good intentions and desperation. In the end, the viewer is forced to make a jarring comparison between the \"thief\" who stole the main char's bicycle and the main char, himself. The irony of the situation causes the viewer to realize his own hypocrisy. Though we formerly considered the first thief to be petty and evil for ruining the main char's life, we can no longer hold such a judgment of him after witnessing the main char do the same- an act which the viewer considers sympathetically. The change in judgment toward the first \"thief\" which the viewer is forced to make at the film's conclusion is a reminder to the viewer that one's awareness of the circumstances governing a situation can dramatically change one's assessment of the situation. The Italian, plural title \"Ladri di Biciclette\" serves to generalize the crime, desperation, degradation, to everyman in post-war Italy. I also loved this movie for the portrayed father-son relationship. The little boy did an excellent job in portraying a boy who attempts to act like a grown up in order to help, and therefore gain the approval of, his father.However, by the end of the movie we are reminded that the boy is just a boy (which the father seems to forget at intervals, but realizes when he offers to take him for pizza, etc.). The father also has a dilemma- and not just that he bears the burden of providing for his family monetarily, but that he must provide moral teaching and an example as well. Moreover, the filial relationship serves to better illustrate the theme of blurred definitions of good and evil. The boy's black-and-white ideas on good and evil is juxtaposed with the reality of post-war Italy, in which there can not be such a clear distinction between the two terms-\"good\" people are forced to do \"bad\" acts in order to survive. The two different moral characterizations are forced to converge in the young boy, himself, when he witnesses his own father commit a crime. The boy is forced to grow up too soon- i.e., to abandon his absolute views on good and evil in favor of the grey reality in order to grant his father forgiveness. The ending of the film illustrates that though a child may constantly seek approval and confirmation from his father, the approval which a father must seek from his son, though far more subtle and less obvious, plays an equally important and intrinsic role in filial relationships.",

            "content": "BICYCLE THIEVES has gone down in film history as a classic for its ability to transport the viewer effortlessly to a different time and place: to post-war Italy, blighted by poverty and restrictions on general life, where the mere possession of an ordinary push bike is the difference between life and death for an ordinary family.The film follows a father and his kid as they pursue the thief who has stolen the father's bicycle. There's no more plot to it than that, but the film uses the opportunity to explore mob violence, social realism, petty crime, justice, family relationships, and of course poverty. It's a well acted and realistic drama throughout, sometimes too realistic as it ultimately ends up being rather depressing.

            "content": "It's interesting to see the street scenes, the apartments, the roadways and the buses in postwar Rome. Those scenes alone make the movie worth watching.But that's about it. The plot is minimalistic, the acting is passable, the pace is very slow, and the soundtrack is poor. There is some suspense initially in the movie, but when you realize that nothing really happens, the suspense rapidly falls away, while the drudgery continues. I have certainly seen worse movies than this over the years- it's not bad, just boring, very slow moving and somewhat pointless- but seeing reviewers claim it's one of the best of all time is beyond bizarre. I'm beginning to conclude that if a movie is dark, depressing, and soulless, it will resonate well with the so called \"learned reviewers\". Personally, I'd prefer some content.",

            "content": "The Bicycle Thief is classic piece of mid-20th century Italian film-making by veteran workhorse director Vittorio De Sica. Using his experience to good advantage, De Sica cast a mix of fellow veteran performers and unknowns - with no stars - to give the film a feeling of universality which would have been missing had well-known actors been cast.The story is simple. It is post-war Italy and the bread lines are long. People are desperate for work and money and many are close to starvation. Antonio, Maria and their son Bruno see a glimpse of hope when Antonio gets a job hanging posters. The job is dependent on his bicycle, however, which is almost immediately stolen after he gets the job. Antonio and Bruno take to the streets to find the bicycle thief.Ostensibly. the film is about poverty, desperation, and the extremes these conditions push people into. And the film is certainly stark, open, and economical in both story-telling and pacing. However, there are also some moral points which are not to be overlooked. The bond between Antonio, Bruno and Maria is certainly touching and all three of the central characters are very believable, very well acted, and very sympathetic. The Bicycle Thief was a first film for all three principal cast members, and all three went on to achieve modest success in European film. Enzo Staiola, who later became a teacher, was particularly impressive in the role of Bruno at the age of 7.As I mentioned above, the film is economically directed. The cinematography is excellent, and it is clear that the director was intimately familiar with his sets - using locations perfectly. The script is also lean and believable, giving the film a realism rarely found in modern cinema, but not uncommon in mid-20th century European cinema. And some of the scenes are so memorable that it is possible to pick out homages paid to the film in major films made a good 50 years later.To discuss the thematic content of this film, and the reasons I can't recommend it for family viewing, any further would require a spoiler, so I will leave off here. My highest recommendation goes to The Bicycle Thief - a well deserved classic which can be enjoyed by most audiences.",

What follows is a desperate search for the vehicle, which means so much more than it may initially seem to. The picture is relatively bleak, a grounded look at a post-war, post-fascist depression that resonates thematically. It's engaging throughout, with believable ground-level detective work and solidly straightforward performances. Its ethics are subtly grey and it asks its audience to draw its own conclusions about its plot. It doesn't compromise and isn't afraid to say what it needs to say. Occasionally, it can drag a little and it isn't exactly enjoyable in the traditional sense. However, it's a compelling and, at times, affecting affair that stays with you after it's over. 7/10",

While I can appreciate its importance in the history of cinema - its revolutionary use of the free roaming camera, the naturalistic performances and cinematography, the simple storyline - the whole thing left me feeling rather cold. For a movie that can only work on an emotional, interior level, the performances were superficial and lacked the required depth. The refreshingly simple storyline, when left to function without the support of strong performances, fizzled out early, and quickly became repetitive and inconsequential. Staiola's brilliant performance as the young Bruno was at times required to carry the whole movie. De Sici is clearly a talented Director, and is able to compose some genuinely striking images. Montuori's photography is brilliant, bringing a remarkable freshness and vitality to the streets of Rome. But on the whole, the movie suffers from poor characterization and the limited abilities of its amateur cast. A definite disappointment.",

            "content": "The reputation of this celebrated Italian neo-realism film preceded itself a little with me but on reflection I think I can understand why it is such a highly regarded movie. A comi- tragedy as opposed to a tragi-comedy, it has a very simple but well delineated narrative, with an ending of rare pathos and sadness.To watch this honest, hard-working and well-meaning family man brought down by wretched luck to the extent where in an act of desperation he debases himself in front of his adoring son, is almost like intruding on private grief. Earlier on in the film, before the father loses all hope in changing his fortunes, there are some nice comedic touches, with the young son \"caught short\" at one point and later when the father blunders into a brothel in pursuit of the bicycle thief, with his infant son in tow.This was my first experience of Italian neo-realism and while I more usually prefer some escapism with my movies, I was quite absorbed in the story here as it unravelled with an inevitable certainty which could never end up well, indeed I guessed that the father was going to lower his scruples by stealing a bike himself, long before he actually did.Yes, it does have some longueurs and the landscape of post-war Italy as well as a full understanding of the Italian psyche was difficult for me to naturally relate to, but the universal themes of honesty, self-respect, human dignity and of course father-son relationships shone through.The open-air cinematography was excellent, the background music was sympathetic to the action and the acting unsurprisingly wholly natural, engaging and involving, given that most of the participants were amateurs. The young lad playing the son, in particular gives the best performance by a child actor I think I've ever seen.For my tastes, I wouldn't include it in my list of favourite films, but can certainly appreciate its qualities and why it's so beloved of critics and cinema-lovers alike.",

Snag is, he needs his bike to do the work and someone has just pinched it. Together with his young son \"Bruno\" (a superb Enzo Staiola) he sets out on the near impossible task of tracking the thing down! What ensues are a series of escapades as the father and son team encounter a range of equally war ravaged citizens - some more helpful than others - on their mini-quest. It's an interesting study on humanity this, centred around something so apparently pedestrian as losing a bike, but the cascading impact of that event on their lives and their relationship as well as with the profound effects on their livelihood and self respect are expertly laid out by De Rica, who draws us gradually into their series of adventures. The simplicity of the story also engenders an opportunity to look at the poverty endured by many sections of the citizenry (those who sit through the mass so they can be rewarded with a bowl of soup rather than worrying about any redemption of their soul, for example). The performance from the young Staiola is excellent. He plays the role of the young boy with considerable natural skill - his character has no real idea of why this bike is so important, nor of why it's loss is causing his father's behaviour to vacillate - but like a loyal puppy, he continues to help out, even saving the day at one stage. The settings in this ancient city add considerably to the sense of despair - ruins (old and new) - and at times they make you wonder of life here has really moved on so much from Roman times. The pace of the film is very well measured, the script is not devoid of a bit humour, even joy, now and again and the momentum builds steadily to a conclusion that is remarkably poignant and that left me with a smile on my face. Question is though, does he find his bike???",

            "content": "The Italian masters working in the cinema of those years that followed WWII changed the way movies were done in their country. After the defeat, years of hardship and penury befell their land. Despair was everywhere because much was in ruin, or there didn't seem to be an end in sight. Thus, the work of the directors of the stature of Roberto Rosellini, Vittorio DeSica, and Luchino Visconti, and the early works of Federico Fellini, went to create the movement we know today as the neorealism. \"Ladri di biciclette\" was perhaps the best exponent of the trend started by these men. The action in the streets of Italy's major cities, mainly Rome, became the natural backdrop for the stories they wanted to narrate. Little was done in studios. Unlike Hollywood, the Italians had one advantage in that recent history could be brought to the screen right from the original locations.The story of Antonio Ricci, a poor unemployed worker, in the days following the end of the conflict, is a gripping tale in which the agony of every day life conspired against him and his family. When his name comes up for a job pasting posters all over Rome, he encounters a big problem. The basis of his employment requires him to have a bicycle in order to move around the city. Alas, Antonio and Maria have pawned it in order to satisfy more pressing needs. Maria has a solution, she will sell her dowry's linen. In exchange, they receive money which will be used to reclaim the precious bicycle.Before going home, Maria decides to go see La Santona, a sort of female seer, that predicted Antonio would get a job. She feels she has to give this woman something as a token of her gratitude. Little is left over for them to live on, but with Antonio's new job, things look better for them. Antonio and Maria have two other sons, Bruno and a newly born baby. Even Bruno has a job, to help ends meet.As Antonio begins to work pasting posters advertising \"Gilda\" all over the city, his precious bicycle is stolen. Antonio must act quickly if he wants to keep working. He goes to find a friend, the head of a cleaning crew. The next day they meet in a square where all kinds of stolen property end up to be sold. Nothing is found, adding to the foul mood Antonio is feeling.Next day is Sunday. Antonio takes Bruno to help him in his search. When they see an old man speaking to the man who stole Antonio's bicycle, they follow him. This old man refuses to tell them anything. Being hungry, he takes Bruno to a trattoria where they can only order the cheapest items on the menu. There is a family sitting nearby with a son about Bruno's age who is enjoying dishes that Bruno cannot have.When they meet by chance the man who took the bicycle, Antonio and Bruno find themselves surrounded by a neighborhood crowd that will not help them at all. The house is searched, but nothing is found. Even the policeman that have tried to help abandons them because of lack of evidence. The solution for Antonio is to try to steal a bicycle because it is the only way for him to keep on working, or so it seems. Unfortunately, when he does get the lonely bike, he is not prepared for the mob that assaults him, leaving him beaten and helpless.This work is one of Vittorio DeSica's masterpieces. The other ones were \"Umberto D\", \"L'oro di Napoli\", and \"La Ciociara\". This film was also written by DeSica and his usual collaborators, among them Cesare Savattini, a genius himself. In Lamberto Maggioriani, the director found the perfect actor to portray Antonio Ricci. Bruno was played by Enzo Staiola, a natural boy actor who had only about eight years at the time. Lianella Carell appears as Maria, although the film belong to Mr. Maggioriani and Mr. Staiola and the great direction by DeSica.",

The main character in the movie is a man named Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) who needs to find a job and then gets one but he needs a bicycle or else he can't get the job so he tells his wife Maria (Lianella Carell) about his situation and so she orders the bicycle for him and so the next morning wakes up takes his son Bruno (Enzo Staiola) to the bus stop and then goes off to work. His job is as a poster hanger and not very long into his first day on the job his bicycle is stolen and has to run around the streets of Rome to find it with the help of his son. This is a masterful portrait of the common working class father who would go to great lengths just to have food on the table and an affordable place to live in for his wife and child as well as himself. Everything about this movie just plays it straight about working class life which is something that a lot of rich, snobbish elitists would never understand unless they experienced what working people go through on a daily basis at some point in their lives while most of the time they're pampered, spoiled, ungrateful brats that don't even care about the so called \"little people\" who helped to make them as rich as they are. I haven't seen that many foreign films in my life but I am convinced that this is among the very best that I've seen with very honest and raw performances throughout, an excellent screenplay by Cesare Zavattini, excellent black and white cinematography, and of course masterful direction by Vittorio De Sica.

            "content": "Bicycle Thieves (1948) **** (out of 4)Neo-realist at its very best in DeSica's tale of a father (Lamberto Maggiorani) who finally lands a job in post WWII Italy but quickly this joy turns to horror when his bicycle is stolen. Without the bike there's no job and without the job his future isn't good as his family is out of money so with the help of his son he searches for the stolen item. There's really nothing new that I could say about this masterpiece that hasn't already been said the past six decades but revisiting this film again after many years just made me appreciate this thing a lot more. I think the entire film is pretty much near flawless but I really loved how raw and powerful it is even during the smallest of scenes. One of the greatest things that happens early on is DeSica simply setting up the atmosphere of the situation. Without words we can see that everyone is broke, hungry and just praying for their break, which in their case is a job. The early scenes really sets everything up in how desperate the times are but DeSica then changes gears and shows how hopefully and happy landing a job can be. Of course, this joy doesn't last too long when the bike is stolen and then we're taken on another rather depressing journey as the father just wants to find his item so he can provide for his family. The messages in the film are so loud and clear that the \"realism\" just jumps right off the screen and you'll be wishing that you could help the man search for his bike. It's rather amazing that this film turned out so well and especially when you consider the budget, the time they had to shoot it and the fact that they used non-professional actors. Maggiorani turns in an incredibly memorable performance, which requires the actor to use just about every emotion possible and you have to say this ranks as one of the strongest performances from a non-actor. Enzo Staiola and Lianella Carell are perfect as well as his son and wife. BICYCLE THIEVES works on a number of levels but without giving anything away, the ending has to be one of the greatest ever done for a film. The movie contains more power and emotion than any of the fake \"dramas\" that get released each year and it remains one of all-time greats.",

            "content": "I've just been reading some of the comments on the Message Board for this movie in particular the frustration of those who love it and castigate those who don't and I relish the irony that there was a healthy audience for John Guillermin's 1960 entry Never Let Go in which a cosmetics salesman (Richard Todd) is fully dependent upon his small family car to visit potential clients and transport his samples; when the car is stolen Todd is distraught; the police offer little help and Todd undertakes a one-man crusade to recover the missing car. Sound familiar? Of course it does because it is Bicycle Thieves with an English accent but Richard Todd was still a major star who had recently portrayed Douglas Bader in The Dambusters, his screen wife, Elizabeth Sellers was also popular on both stage and screen and the 'heavy' used-car dealer Lional Meadows, was played by Peter Sellers who by then was well on the way to superstardom. By contrast Lamberto Maggiorani (Antonio), Enzo Staiola (Bruno) and Lianella Carell (Maria) who comprised the Ricci family were not only complete unknowns but they weren't even actors. On the other hand this was the chief strength of the film which unfolded in a Rome light years away from the one in Three Coins In The Fountain or Roman Holiday, a Rome, in fact, that could just as well have been downtown Tallin or Riga. Keep it simple is a fine philosophy and it would be difficult to keep it simpler than this: Stage One: Despair - no work, no prospects; Stage Two: Hope - a job offer, all it takes is a bike; Stage Three: Determination: Hock the family bedsheets and unhock bike; Stage Four: Elation - new job means new prospects, better life, etc. Stage Five: Despair: - the bike is stolen and we're back to square one.Sometimes simple equals Simply Great.",

He is told unequivocally, \"No bicycle, no job.\" His wife Maria pawns their bedsheets in order to get money to redeem his bicycle from the pawnbroker. On his first day of work, Antonio's bicycle is stolen by a young thief.This film is listed by just about everyone as one of the greatest films of all time. It has influenced everyone, and pushed the \"realist\" style of film, especially with the use of non-professional actors. It even inspired the film \"Pee Wee's Big Adventure\".For me, I have an interest in Italian film, but a fairly small knowledge of it beyond the horror realm (Bava, Fulci, Argento, etc.). This film was quite possibly more influential in Italy than America, and it is interesting that Sergio Leone appears in an uncredited role... he could debatably be said to be the most successful Italian director of all time.Does this film deserve all its praises? In short, yes. I am not going to add much here just because you will universally find positive reviews, and I am not going to disagree with those whom I agree with and whom have said their pieces better than I could.",

            "content": "I always find it a bit difficult to rate movies this old. Not only is the technology significantly different these days but, typically, structure and pace is quite strange when compared to these times. However, Bicycle Thieves still has a modern appeal to it. Mainly because of what it's tackling. The approach it takes to this father son story is timeless. It's all about a father whose bike gets stolen from him and his son who helps him look for it. It's no more complex then that. Even though it's not even 90 minutes there were stretches where I did wish for a little more complexity, not in the story but with the characters. The story is simple, which I think works perfectly, but the characters are as well. Aside from the complicated but beautifully executed messaging of father son dynamics and social class in fighting, there isn't much else to latch onto. The film looks nice enough for the time and the music is good but I did want more from the characters. Again, the simple, ever escalating story is great though. One thing leads to another and another and another until our main character is driven to do the very thing that harmed him in the first place. Of course there's something to say here in regards to the poverty that is portrayed and classicism but the home run is the themes of cycles. Cycles of violence, cycles of poor vs poor, and cycles of poverty. Here we deliberately see how rigged the system can be and how difficult it is to rise from poverty. As soon as something goes right for this father figure he is launched backwards by someone slightly below him. He gets a job and then his bike is stolen. Without a bike he has no job, so when he can't recover his own bike, he opts to steal one. It's a tough story to watch because of how honest it is. People everywhere right now are taken advantage of by people above and below them which leads them to feel as if they have to do the same just to survive. It's a timeless story about timeless themes.",

Well, you'll get it. This is an extremely realistic movie, in the *true* sense of the word 'realism' (not like the Hollywood definition where realism = tons of blood, swearing and explicit sex. What the hell reality are they in? ...and how do I get there?!). This is a movie which depicts a day in the life of an ordinary person in postwar Italy who is subjected to an ordinary misfortune. He reacts in an ordinary way. People, in turn, react to him in ordinary ways. This movie is so real, it might come across as boring to most people. But I assure you, it's packed with substance.It's truly one of the most affecting cinema experiences, because it shows you the poetry we all experience in every single moment of our mundane, day-to-day, unsung lives. A similar story happens to each of the 6 billion humans on this planet every day. And each story is absolutely monumental in its simplicity.I can't think of too many other films that are so effective without resorting to gimmicks, histrionics or melodrama. Maybe the fact that De Sica chose an unknown cast is the reason why it was so successful in its excellent presentation. This is a great human story. I give it an 8 out of 10.

I think the character is fine, and Enzo Staiola' performance visually is pretty exceptional... But his line delivery was so bad at points I wished Bruno wasn't in the film at all.The neo-realist style is something that I adore and this film uses the style to its fullest potential, I can't imagine anyone else but Carlo Montuori shooting this, it gives everything a sense of realism and the stakes are high due to this and great writing. Alessandro Cicognini' score was also great.One half of my family is religious and the other isn't, I tend to lean to the more non-religious side of things but I've been exposed to both lifestyles so I quite enjoyed the religious angle of bicycle thieves. It's not necessarily anti-religion, it's more complex than that, but it does explore the way religion can manipulate people or the way people can use religion as a way of justifying their actions. This is something I think about all the time and I always love to see complex ideas like this in film. There are also anti-war themes which are even more prominent than the themes of religion, to expect with Italian-neo-realist films.Overall I absolutely loved Bicycle Thieves and I'm considering picking up the criterion.

The one manipulative aspect in the movie was the little boy joining his father in search of the bicycle. I felt that was too Chaplinesque and melodramatic. I think the movie would have been better without the boy. The man's abysmal solitude would have been highlighted. I get the impression that the movie makers felt that a lone adult would elicit less sympathy than an adult and a kid. What appealed to me most were the elements beyond the plot: the music and the visual effects, the sights and sounds. A good movie is never just \"about\" something or other.

            "content": "At first, I thought the plurality in the title of the two-disc 2007 Criterion Collection DVD set was an error in translation, but now I realize it is an accurate description of the moralistic symmetry presented in this classic 1948 film, the pinnacle of the post-WWII Italian neo-realism movement. It's the type of art-house film of which everybody has heard, but relatively few have actually seen. That's why for me, seeing it for the first time in the clean print transfer offered by Criterion becomes a transcendent experience not only for the heartbreaking story of one man's dire situation but for the rueful way it depicts the way of life among Rome's poverty-stricken inhabitants after the devastation of war. While much of the credit belongs to renowned director Vittorio De Sica (\"Two Women\", \"The Garden of Finzi-Continis\") and his frequent writing partner, Cesare Zavattini, Carlo Montuori's beautifully composed cinematography and Alessandro Cicognini's melancholy music score contribute immeasurably to the vivid portrayal of the city's unforgiving nature.Against such a teeming backdrop, the basic story at its heart comes across as almost a parable. With the scarcity of jobs after the war, men desperately wait for a chance at any menial job. Antonio Ricci gets his opportunity when he is hired to glue movie posters around the city. The one condition to his hiring is that he must have a bicycle, an ironic point since he just sold his previous one to feed his family. When his wife sells their bed sheets for cash, Antonio can afford one, and he beams with pride over his new job. So does his son Bruno who quickly learns every nook and cranny of the bicycle. On the very first day of his new job, however, his bicycle is stolen. Antonio has a Sunday to find it before reporting back to work the next day, and the rest of the movie follows father and son on a palpably desperate search. One frustrating event follows another as Antonio grows increasingly angry, weary and desperate with his hopes fading precipitously. These episodes allow De Sica to spotlight postwar Rome in highly charged personal detail - Antonio pursuing an old man to a church mass, confronting a suspect in a hostile neighborhood, treating his son to a restaurant meal, visiting a fortune teller whose prediction is frustratingly curt. Meanwhile, the bond between father and son evolves in mercurial fashion throughout the day.De Sica hired amateurs off the street to play the roles, which likely explains why the naturalistic performances resonate so much. With his worn fedora and a constant look of intensely felt desperation, Lamberto Maggiorani fully inhabits the role of Antonio. As the cherubic Bruno devoted to his father no matter the depth of despair, Enzo Staiola really carries the moral conscience of the story in an intensely watchful manner. During their momentary respite in the restaurant, he produces a memorable look of forlorn acceptance when Antonio says they cannot afford to eat like the family at the next table. The ending is heartbreaking without relying on cheap sentiment. The first disc contains the movie with surprisingly no film scholar commentary (Criterion's usual practice with such a renowned classic). The second disc includes interviews conducted in 2005 about working with De Sica (Staiola, close to seventy now, is among the subjects), an hour-long Italian TV documentary about Zavattini, and a forty-minute history of Italian neo-realism. The accompanying 75-page booklet is an exceptional extra containing a multitude of scholarly essays and remembrances.",

To understand why this is considered a masterpiece of cinema and one of the best films ever made, one must put the era of its release into perspective. It's 1948 - post war Italy and poverty is everywhere. Humanity is difficult to come by. Hollywood is in a glitz and glamor mode, while Italian cinema has been dominated with light-hearted and simple films. Vittorio De Sica is a matin\u00e9e idol as an actor and also, as a director, one of the driving forces of Neo-realism ... a genre that focused on the struggles of real people.There is nothing fancy or complicated about this story. Ricci is one of the masses looking for work at a time when jobs are beyond scarce. One day he is extremely fortunate to be offered a job posting signs around town. He is elated at the opportunity to again provide for his wife and young son. The only catch ... he must have a bicycle for the job. His wife pawns their bedsheets to retrieve the bicycle and we join in with their pride and happiness brought on by this job.We see Ricci on a ladder posting a Rita Hayworth movie advertisement ... an example of Hollywood's polar opposite approach to movies as compared to the Italian neo-realism. While on the ladder, Ricci witnesses the theft of his precious bicycle. His frantic reaction demonstrates the loss means so much more than the loss of two-wheeled transportation. It's actually the loss of hope.Soon enough Ricci and his young son Bruno are searching the streets of Rome trying to find the bicycle. It plays like a road trip movie as they experience many interactions on the streets and back alleys. Their search is painful to watch and father and son endure many emotions, none more powerful than the last few minutes and a touching final shot that is a tribute to the great Charlie Chaplin.All three lead actors are first timers which adds to the realistic look and feel of the characters and stories. Lamberto Maggiorani (Ricci) was a factory worker who showed up for auditions. He is a very striking man with a Daniel Day-Lewis appearance. Enzo Staiola (Bruno) was a 7 year old boy just watching the whole movie process when he was picked out of the crowd and cast. Lianella Carell (Maria) was a journalist on set to interview De Sica when he cast her as the wife/mother. Additionally, most of this was filmed on the streets and on location in Rome (very few sets).The actual Italian title is \"Ladri di biciclette\" which translates into Bicycle Thieves, but it has been best known in the U.S. as The Bicycle Thief. It's based on a novel by Luigi Bartolini and the screenplay comes from the incredibly prolific screenwriter Cesare Zavattini, who worked with most of the great filmmakers from the 1940's through the 1970's. Also of note, Sergio Leone was an assistant to director Vittorio De Sica during production. De Sica directed many wonderful films including Sunshine (1947), which looked at juvenile corruption, and Umberto D. (1952) which examined old age.Many question the status of this film as a masterpiece all these years later, but I certainly still experience it's powerful and sensitive message, and would recommend to anyone who admires world cinema and the classics.",

Now it surprises and reaches only those inexperienced in film. It's certainly a good example of it's genre, but it's no longer unique. Also,many may find the ending unsatisfying (as it may have been intended to be.) The film offers only a problem and no solution. However, it's characters are noteworthy. The main character, the father, is a struggling, moral every-day joe, and his son is an impressionable boy who at times seems more adult than his parent. In fact, if their personalities were swapped the outcome of the story may have been very different.

            "content": "It amazes me that even after nearly 70 years, there remain movies you can come across that become truly seasoned with the passage of time. That perceived immortality may lie in the continued relevance in subject matter, it's true to life story telling or its compelling characters. Many of these older films capture the smaller joys or moments with its subtle yet beautiful cinematography. They elicit an acute nostalgia that stays with you long after the credits have rolled. Bicycle Thieves (Ladri di biciclette) gives us a seemingly straightforward plot. A poor father struggles to get a job post-WWII Italy. He is given a great job opportunity, one that is contingent on having a bike. He buys one and, well, you could put the rest together based on the title. One thing I love about Bicycle Thieves is that, from beginning to end, it steers away (no pun intended) from the conventional storytelling and plot development we've come to expect from movies nowadays. In doing so, it is also a perceptive exploration of how times have changed.A film ostensibly about a bike hunt delves much deeper into universal themes, at its core, that many can relate to. The story focuses on Antonio Ricci, the story's protagonist who begins as a kind-hearted soul, and chronicles his gradual devolution. It would appear that losing the bike is emblematic of his dwindling dignity; as the idea of re-entering poverty becomes more of a reality, Antonio's goodwill gradually begins to crumble. The film is, above all else, evocative of a simpler time where things like bikes were considered this prized commodity. As I experienced their journey running around Rome, I couldn't help but smile witnessing the functioning of a technology-less society. In the version I streamed it with online, there were several editing errors, presumably from the film being the victim of a re-uploaded version. This is likely unintentional. The grey shades from the palette of black and white colors appear to change and become darker as the film progresses, accompanying the shift in mood of the film. This is likely intentional. The film's long shots give us beautiful snippets into Rome and immerse us right in the middle of the landscape.

It's a movie about a post-war Italy, jobs are scarce and everyone sort of has to find a way to provide for their own families. This movie is probably the best example of Italian Neo-Realism, exploring the difficult lives of the working class in a post-WW2 Italy.All of the performances are outstanding, especially Lamberto Maggiorani and Enzo Satiola, who plays Bruno in what has to be 100% one of the greatest child performances of all time. The second to last shot in the movie, which is Bruno crying in disbelief and then suddenly holding his dad's hand as they walk with the masses, it's tough to watch. It has to be one of the most heartbreaking moments in all of film history.But what this movie does so well is just express this period in time in Italy's history, a time of poverty and desperation where good people have to turn to doing bad things just to get by.

This is exactly what excites me most in the movie: disoriented and wandering aimlessly through the streets of Rome, the man intersects with crowds of other men like him, each trapped in its day-to-day, ignorant and uninterested in the problems other. Interaction with others is invariably characterized by conflict - there is no time or resources to listen to matters that are not ours.

            "content": "This movie has no loopholes and is the father of neorealist cinema. The story is simple and an honest depiction of the helplessness of a poor family. A jobless man (Antonio Ricci) finds a job of sticking posters in the post second world war Italy. With great difficulty he arranges for a bicycle which gets stolen on the very first day at work. Antonio knows he can't find it but still he has no choice so he sets out with his son to look for his bicycle. Audiences along with father and son contemplate every aspect of bicycle i.e. number plates, careers, pedals etc while searching for it. The desperation of the protagonist is heart-breaking.I was avoiding this flick because a friend of mine told me an Indian classic called 'Do Beega Zameen' is loosely based on 'Bicycle thief'. I love this Indian flick but I didn't want to see any thing in the same line. After a long time I happened to see 'Bicycle thief' and realized that this movie is just incomparable. All the main characters in the film are non actors. Enzo Staiola who played Bruno (son) was literally picked from the street. He has done a fantastic job. Lamberto Maggiorani as 'Ricci' was also employed in a similar way. It seems they were picked up because of the way they walked. 'Sica' must be a great man. Lamberto Maggiorani is just too real. I don't know if it's his non-actor background or something 'Sica' did. It looks as if he is really looking for a bicycle. One scene after other is like a collage of postwar Italy told through two characters. The whole church sequence is a satire on the double standards of the roman society. In one of the scenes, Ricci decides to eat in a restaurant on the grounds that if we have to die of hungers why not eat good food before that; Bruno is ogling at people who are eating expensive food and Ricci in the middle of the food starts calculating what he could have earned if his cycle was not stolen. It's a very powerful scene if you have equated hunger, food and money ever in your life. The film is so real that you forget that its film. The last few scenes gets you totally. 'Sica' has used a cycle to expose poor post war Italy how cool is that? If cinema is not doomed and survives in the next century it's because of films like these.",

Unburdened by sudden plot twists or multiple character arcs, these stories are able to take the time to truly focus on their characters, allowing us to absorb every minute detail, each moment presented to us with stark realism. Vittorio De Sica's 'The Bicycle Thief' (or, if you take the literal translation from the Italian title, 'Bicycle Thieves') is such a story. The plot itself is surprisingly simple: a poor family man, Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) manages to acquire a well-paying job, in an era when well-paying jobs are almost impossible to find. To keep the job, however, he needs to have his bicycle, and when it is stolen from him when his back in momentarily turned, Antonio fears that his job \u0096 and his family \u0096 is doomed to suffer. Accompanied by his bright-eyed, intelligent young son, Bruno (Enzo Staiola), Antonio travels across Rome in search of his bicycle.'The Bicycle Thief' is often cited as one of the most accomplished examples of neorealism, and rightly so. Though I was initially unfamiliar with the term, neorealism is a cultural movement that brings elements of true life in the stories it describes, and the movement was primarily developed in Europe after World War Two. In this film, we are not treated to an happy endings, of always-loving characters with broad smiles departing into the glorious sunset. Antonio and Bruno, having not recovered the bike, disappear soundlessly into a crowd of disheartened poor men, their meagre problems amounting to nothing amidst the widespread poverty in post-war Rome. We may not necessarily enjoy this bleak, somewhat pessimistic conclusion, but the film is all the more poignant and emotionally moving for it.Cary Grant and Henry Fonda were originally considered for the main role in the film, before director Vittorio De Sica opted to use nonprofessional actors. The two main stars, Maggiorani and Staiola, were, in fact, chosen for their respective roles based solely on the styles of their walks. Lamberto Maggiorani does a remarkable job in his film debut as the hopeless and anguished poor man battling to provide for his family, whilst Enzo Staiola's wide-eyed curiosity \u0096 always looking upwards towards his father for guidance \u0096 is perfect for the role of the young son. Together, Antonio and Bruno display a fascinating father-son intimacy. And, even over just a few days, we are able to witness the ever-so-subtle highs and lows of their relationship. Also notable is Lianella Carell, likewise in her film debut, as Antonio's ever-worrying wife, Maria.",

Employing (out of fiscal necessity, no doubt) then fresh techniques of outdoor location photography with non-professional actors, De Sica relates the simple but powerful story of a poor worker in the economic shambles of post WWII Rome and what happens when his bicycle, his only source of employment, is stolen. With his young son he then embarks on an increasingly desperate search for the culprit, which in the end becomes a painful but not unrewarding odyssey of discovery for both father and son.

This neo-realist approach works almost as a filmed documentary of Italy and the existence forced upon it's citizens. When Antonio loses his bicycle he loses so much more and his desperate search in the overcrowded streets is one of cinema's most emotional exploration of a man trying to capture his dignity that was taken from him. The bicycle was his job, his sense of purpose and it ensured a good livelihood for his family.The non-actors give forceful performances, especially the little boy.

            "content": "Bicycle Thieves tells the story of the unemployed father of a poor family in post World War II Italy: two parents, a boy and a newborn baby. The movie starts with the father, Antonio, getting a chance to finally get a job - not a minor thing in Italy of that era. A lot of people were facing poverty. The job required a bike, which Antonio didn't have, so the family had to buy it with the little money they had. The next day, the bike were stolen, and that's pretty much what drives the plot - Antonio has to find it, otherwise he'd lose his job and his family may starve for weeks. In my opinion, the movie successfully portrays the ways in which one can act when his back is pressed against the wall, and how far people may go for the sake of bringing food to their table. The movie also shows some criticism towards the disabled government, and the way that it ignores the real needs of the people. I like the way the movie was filmed, the acting is quite solid too, and the whole movie feels like an actual thing that could happen, at that place and in that time. There are a lot of subtle ways in which we're exposed to the harsh reality of that time, and the subtle criticism in certain scenes is quite clever. The relationship between the Antonio and his son, Bruno, is also pretty interesting. The score is well composed too. However, I think that the movie has one main problem;\nWe don't feel a true emotional connection to Antonio. Sure, the situation feels real and I think that anyone can understand and relate to how Antonio feels, but his personality is just not that likeable. It's not that I didn't care for him at all, but let's say that his character acts in a certain way that kept me from being more captivated and empathetic for his character. Overall, it is a good movie, but I'd recommend it to people that like a strong message, and not necessiraly looking for something super-fun to watch. XDp.s: There are two scenes that I actually really like. One is the final scene, and the other is the kind-of climax scene with all those people in the street :)",

We come to this understanding by considering the life of Antonio Ricci and his wife and young boy. As the film opens Ricci has no job and is among about a hundred men crowding around an official who has a few jobs to assign. Ricci is thrilled to get the job of pasting posters around the city, but the catch is that he needs a bicycle for the job and he has pawned his bike in order to get by. He takes the job anyway and promises to have a bike. He retrieves the bike by pawning all the sheets in the household. Things look good for Ricci at that time until he gets his bicycle stolen the first day on the job. The remainder of the movie has Ricci and his young son trying to find the stolen bike.The power of the movie derives from seeing how Ricci's desperate situation eats at his soul. Consider the arc of his degradation. At first he is happy to have been offered a job and is affectionate with his son. The fist small blow to his self-esteem is to stand by while his wife takes the initiative to pawn the household sheets to retrieve his bike. Once the bike is stolen he and his son attend a bike flea market with the idea that they might recover the stolen bike, but after some pretense he has to admit that it's hopeless. In trying to follow a lead to the thief he disrupts a church service and is escorted out. In pursuit of the thief he rushes into a brothel causing a ruckus. From scorning the prognostications of a psychic he later turns to her for advice. He confronts the thief and, even in the presence of a policeman, he is tossed out of the thieve's neighborhood and is forced to slink away. At one point he hits his son without apologizing and then is irritated with his son's falling and scraping his knees. There is the final humiliation of his thieving a bicycle himself, only to be caught. And all of this is witnessed by his son.The final scene leaves us wondering how many insults a man can take to his pride and still press on.",

I'm not going to pretend that I'm an Italian expert after three months here but I do think it captures the feel of Italy pretty well, and sadly, given the current state of affairs here the commentary still rings quite true on both a micro and macro level; comments about \"nothing has changed\" abounded in my company, like everyone I watched it with had had their bikes stolen or bought a stolen bike, and the unemployment is through the roof.Either way you don't really have to read too much into it, it's first and foremost a solid (melo)drama, and as such, De Sica does lay it on pretty thick, but it feels like such a humane work that I'm willing to let most of the overwroughtness slide.",

The Italian title literally translates into English as 'Bicycle Thieves', because \"ladri\" is in plural. As such, the English title makes more sense than the American one, because the desperate protagonist becomes a bicycle thief himself.The story is set in Rome and the camera does a good job in showing the streets of that city and capturing the rest. And the fact that it is in black and white makes it deeper and gives it a more nostalgic feeling. Call it good cinematography.Something very curious (which would be impossible today) is that, instead of professional actors, they used people without experience in acting. Yet, they are brilliant in their roles, particularly Lamberto Maggiorani (the leading actor, who portrays Antonio Ricci) and Enzo Staiola (as his cute little son Bruno). They are so convincing and realistic in their performances. It's as if, more than portraying the characters, they BECAME them.It's an extremely simple movie in all ways: cinematography, plot, etc. Not that there is anything wrong or bad about that, quite the contrary! It's a good movie.The film tells the story of Antonio Ricci, a poor man who needs a job urgently and actually finds one (hanging up posters), but with one condition: he's gotta own a bicycle - which is necessary for the work. No bicycle, no job. Get it? So he buys one, but in order to buy it his wife is forced to pawn the sheets of their bed.The good news don't last. Just as he is starting his 1st day in the new job, his bicycle is robbed. He's forced to search for the bicycle with the help of Bruno and other people he knows, as the police doesn't help him at all. Of course that such task will be very difficult and, in fact, they spend hours trying to find it in Rome's streets.During the search, Ricci and Bruno spend time together and they even go to a restaurant where they eat a nice meal: mozzarella bread. During the whole film, the connection between Bruno and his father is notorious, as Bruno often looks at him and helps him in the various circumstances.When Ricci finally encounters the thief and angrily demands him to give back what belongs to him, it's no use. No one but Bruno helps him in this situation. The bike doesn't appear, the thief's neighbors fiercely defend him, there ain't any witnesses and even the policeman isn't much of a help. He loses in the most humiliating and unfair way and the thief simply gets away with it.The climax of the story comes when, in a moment of despair (although not without some hesitation), Antonio steals one bicycle but is seen taking it and caught by angry men who mistreat him. Luckily, he is set free. The movie ends with father and son depressed, holding hands and crying. That is the most emotional part of the film. And that is undeniably one of the most poignant and dramatic endings in film history.The guy was simply out of luck. When his bicycle was taken, nobody saw and nobody even tried to stop the thief. When he was the one stealing one, he was ferociously chased and caught. Life is so ungrateful. Plus, it's not just some bicycle. His life and his family's too depend on that bicycle, as without it he can't have the job.In fact, this movie is a take on the situation of many italians who, after the World War II, were poor, unemployed, going through great difficulties to get a job and without perspectives of future. Just how many of us feel now. Only today the situation seems far more critical and it just keeps getting worse every year.As a movie, it can be somewhat difficult to judge, although it is one of the most regarded Italian films and appears in many lists of the all time's finest films.",

            "content": "I saw this movie many years ago and went back to view it again. It touched me in the same way. This movie is a work that speaks to the human condition in a way that Vittorio De Sica's movies often succeed in achieving. In that sense, it is timeless and a great work. This movie has something to say. The story is about a family man whose bicycle is stolen. This deprives him of a job, something very hard for him to come by in post-war Italy. He is devastated but the man and his young son set out to find it. During the movie, I was struck by the loss of self-respect that comes from grinding poverty, the raising and dashing of hopes, the disappointments seen in the eyes of a spouse, the hurt that is felt in the heart of a child. For me, this movie conveys these emotions.Vittorio De Sica was a master of the neo-realist school of cinema in the 1940's and 50's. He uses on-location shooting and in this movie, amateur actors, to tell his story. Our heart goes out to the father in the movie. We are on his side and yet everywhere he goes, he is rejected. This movie takes into a world that is all-too-real for some people. If we have personally experienced such hardship, we can forget what it's like to be up against a wall. This movie reminds us as it draws us into the lives of the characters. There are many entertaining movies; there are some that represent technical achievement or great acting; others make us laugh or cry. This movie made me feel real heartache and pain. It takes great talent for a director and actors to achieve that reaction. This may not be to everyone's liking. After all, we don't go to a movie to leave feeling depressed. Be we should never turn our backs on those who are down on their luck, if only because they could be us.",

            "content": "It's extremely difficult to write a review of Bicycle Thieves without mentioning the influence it had on world cinema, but had it not been for Bicycle Thieves directors like Kurosawa, Ozu, or Satyajit Ray (who in turn went on to inspire the vast bulk of the Hollywood renaissance, ie. Coppola, Lucas, Scorcese, etc) would have been deprived of one of their biggest influences. In other words, no Bicycle Thieves means no Pather Panchali, no Ikiru, no Tokyo Story, and therefore no Godfather, Taxi Driver or The Conversation. It might sound like an exaggeration, but without Bicycle Thieves, at least one quarter of the last half-century's greatest movies might have never been made.Many reviews here have already commented on the superb level of acting (which is remarkable given that virtually everyone is a non-professional) and the moving storyline, so it's difficult to add anything of substance. That said, I still can't decide whether the outlook of Bicycle Thieves is pessimistic, subversive, or neither. Andre Bazin famously called Bicycle Thieves the only true communist film of the 1940s, but I'm not entirely sure if that applies. There are allusions to the class struggle (particularly during the scene in the restaurant), but the film falls short of directly calling for a radical social change, instead portraying the working class of Italy as hopelessly divided by its own poverty, unemployment and greed. While that in itself may suggest De Sica's desire for a proletariat united against injustices posed by the system (an old Marxist chestnut), it's still a comment the film never makes in a literal form - if it's there, it's hidden away somewhere in the narrative for the audience to decipher themselves. In that respect Bicycle Thieves quite clearly differs from many other Italian neo-realist movies like Ossessione, because it does not directly criticise the capitalist system, instead preferring to remain ambiguous and leaving the audience to arrive at their own conclusions about the fate of Antonio and Bruno (the most lovable and sympathetic father-and-son pairing I've ever seen on film, I hasten to add) and of Italian society in general. In a way it's probably for the best that De Sica has chosen to portray the message of the film in an ambiguous light instead of patronising his audience with lectures and slogans (a la Ken Loach), since it enables him to portray social injustice without running the risk of alienating his audience, something which many politically motivated film makers inadvertently tend to do.Its ideological implications aside, Bicycle Thieves is a cinematic milestone as well as one of the most emotionally moving films you'll ever see. Highly recommended.",

A man desperate for work has his bicycle stolen on the first day of his new job. Since he needs the bicycle to keep the job, he spends the rest of the movie roaming the streets of Rome with his young son looking for it. But of course the PLOT of \"The Bicycle Thief\" goes far beyond this. It's about a man who is struggling to hold on to his faith in humanity when everything else in his life is telling him not to.The film looks like a documentary, thanks to De Sica's use of on-location shooting and non-actors, hallmarks of Italian Neo-Realist cinema. It also eschews the emotional bombast of your classic narrative Hollywood storytelling from the same time period -- only occasionally does our protagonist display an emotion beyond that of weary resignation that remains on his face for most of the movie, and even then these other emotions appear for a moment or two. It's a quiet, thoughtful and poetic movie, and it rewards patience.I admire \"The Bicycle Thief\" but I can't bring myself to say that I actually enjoyed watching it. It's certainly effective and it belongs to that class of films that needed to be made in order for cinema as an art form to evolve. But it's not exactly entertaining, and it's capped by a quietly devastating and very bleak ending.Grade: A",

            "review_title": "Neorealist, Timeless, Humane Masterpiece from BICYCLE THIEF to BICYCLE THIEVES",
            "content": "\"You live and you suffer\" (Antonio Ricci) Life is an altogether weird phenomenon: it makes us experience a cycle of joys and sorrows, losses and achievements that appear within and around ourselves. If you have ever found yourself within a labyrinth of 'civilized cages' created by social and emotional life, BICYCLE THIEVES is a film that will touch you tremendously. As the purest representative of the Neorealist movement begun by Roberto Rossellini in 1945, the movie, directed by great Vittorio De Sica and written by his collaborator Cesare Zavattini, has been widely acclaimed as a masterpiece. Just to quote some eminent reviewers: \"Again the Italians have sent us a brilliant and devastating film;\" (Bosley Crowther, New York Times); \"Neorealism never got more real...a brilliant, tactlessly real work of art;\" (Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian); \"Marriage of form and meaning\" (Steven D. Greydanus). Its simple, modest communication is clear to vast majority. So to say, both a child and a parent will find something unforgettable here thanks to...direct content.There is, actually, no storyline but a picture of a situation in post-war Rome, a plague of poverty and unemployment that affects the protagonist, Antonio Ricci and his family - wife Maria and two children, little boy Bruno and a newborn baby. In the opening sequence, the camera is in between the situation, which makes the method exceptionally magnetic. Antonio Ricci is given a job at last, but there is one condition \u2013 owning a bicycle. Thanks to a peculiar idea of his wife, he can redeem a bike at a pawn shop and begin his job of delivering and putting up posters. However, as soon as the 'Singular' title BICYCLE THIEF complicates a lot in his/their lives, everything gradually leads towards the 'Plural' BICYCLE THIEVES (consider an interesting analysis of title versions by Bob Graham). That is where the things we observe become the things we empathize with. The core gist of the movie is a human being placed among other human beings. In what ways? FATHER-SON RELATIONS: De Sica with Zavattini beautifully present to us this 'couple' of male characters with the overwhelming screen presence of non professionals: Lamberto Maggiorani and Enzo Staida (in accordance with the purest form of Neorealism). At first, Bruno (Enzo Staida) is very willing to help his dad \u2013 it is a natural driving force in him and yet, when he encounters the growing obsession of his father, the little boy gets confused and totally puzzled. Their relations are based on spontaneous emotions that, on the one hand, uplift them and, on the other hand, depress them. With reference to Crowther's words, this \"classic plan\" is manifested in them, the \"plan in which the comedy and tragedy of daily life are recognized.\" The inhumane rush that they both experience, the rush towards a dead-end destination poisons their mutual existence. Skills and effectiveness stand in confrontation with motives and will. Is there any redemption from all this psychological state of a materialist slave who creates a mindful uproar? Note the scenes of Bruno falling in the street behind his father who does not even notice it. Moreover, the eye contact that appears to be an attempt of the boy to see his dad's reactions is something that remains from the silent perfection of portraying emotions without words.SOCIAL DEPRAVITY: With reference to Crowther's words, 'he (De Sica) is holding a mirror up to millions of civilized men,\" the movie addresses \"complex social world that is ironically blessed with institutions to comfort and protect mankind.\" It does it similarly like other great cinematic products of the post war Italy. Ignoring the historical circumstances of BICYCLE THIEVES, its signal is something of a timeless, ever-current warning: Look around because there is someone \u2013 an individual or a family - who may suffer more than you. Let me focus on their mutual 'odyssey' for a while that bears resemblance with Fellini's unforgettable character of Cabiria played by Giulietta Masina in NIGHTS OF CABIRIA. Although there is a huge difference between the protagonists, the movies bear certain resemblance. Who are the people they meet on their way? No matter if a policeman, a bus driver, a marketeer, a seminarian, a beggar, a fraud, a clairvoyant, a mother, Bradshaw refers to them as 'faces.' What do they appear if not either mere shadows that come and go or charlatans keen on sheer profit? Apart from the plot of one Santona, a Wise Woman who owns an alleged power to see into mysteries of past, present and future, there is an additional aspect of startling social discrepancies and celebrity admiration. While Cabiria visits her idol Alberto Lazzari, Antonio focuses his subconscious spellbound on Rita Hayworth's sex appeal in the poster. The sets of Rome, including Porta Portese, Via del Traforo or Lungotevere Ripa and Via Pietro da Cortona with Stadio Flaminio supply us with a more intense combination of spots and people. At the same time, they constitute mindful witnesses of the protagonists' desperate quest. A note should be made of interesting score that evokes moods, sometimes sorrows, sometimes joys. Consider the Trattoria scene when Bruno is granted a little reward, little moment of peace and a human minute within the wretched rush. Yet, even there, 'let's forget all this' occurs to turn into 'put down some numbers.' There is also excellent use of clues, for instance when Antonio leaves his new bike at the gate of Wise Woman, La Santona...we expect that it is going to be stolen there (having suggested that from the title) but...not yet.The film begins and ends with simplicity...a child and his diverse feelings expressed on face. These moments tell him more about his dad than any words could ever do so...Life for him is a constant search for something, perhaps by skipping simple joys of childhood, simple wandering and playing. A great insight into child's authenticity that ignores complications...kids simply want to LIVE...only allow them to.",

A slow pace and a dawdling plot don't usually bother me, as long as the characters themselves are interesting.

The careful technique certainly has a lot to do with that, and in addition the simple sincerity of the characters and situations generally works better than you might have expected.Following the basic daily concerns of a working man and his family makes for a sharp contrast with the material in most well-known movies, and that kind of story in itself is enough to make the \"neo-realism\" genre worth exploring. It's not easy to hold an audience's attention with such material, and the unadorned appearance of the movie conceals a fair amount of skill, planning, and even a little artifice.The story-telling technique itself is polished, proceeding at a pace that draws the viewer into Antonio's world through the kind of understandable problems and worries that he has. It takes a while before you realize that you don't really know much about him except for his concerns of the present.Only in a couple of later scenes, such as the sequence with him eating in a restaurant with his son, is the character developed a little more fully.It all has a curious feel, as if the specific characters and events were not as important as the experience of being in their world for a little while. In a number of scenes, the situation readily suggests many other circumstances with different details that would produce the same kinds of feelings. Even Antonio's frustrating dealings with the police are not focused on taking cheap shots at the authorities, as would likely be the case in a Hollywood film, but on the way that the reality of things affects Antonio.It's probably a film to be respected rather than enjoyed, because of the often downbeat subject matter and the lack of strong characters. It's a little hard to call it a truly great film, yet it's well worth seeing, and it leaves an impression afterwards that may be somewhat stronger than any feeling it arouses while you're actually watching it.",

The first aspect is the frustration arising from loss of something petty in the view of the world, but essential for one's life. The father and son seem to be alone in the world looking for their bicycle. Initially, they did have friends, but gradually as this movie beautifully shows, they are all alone. The whole world is indifferent to them or against them in their search for the bicycle. The movie is successful in developing pity and sympathy for the protagonist in the minds of all that watch the movie.The second aspect of the movie, which made me judge the movie as a masterpiece, is the father-son relationship. This relation has been picturized in a natural manner, but it magnificently captures many subtle emotions in the fathers-son relation. In an attempt to be explicit, I have listed these various emotions below:Son to father::1) How well the son understands his father's troubles and silently faces his problems (not complaining when he falls, resting himself without any complaints when tired)2) How the son tries to keep up with the expectations of his father (Trying to run as fast as he can, crossing streets hurriedly)3) How the son observes his father's problems and frustration (when he cleans himself after he falls with his father's handkerchief, and then the father uses it to wipe his face).4) How the son breaks when things seem completely out of control (Slap, Public beating of his father)Father to son::1) How father wishes to see a manly companion in his son (In all his search for bicycle, he assumes his son will follow him and help him. He takes his son for wine)2) How he is sandwiched between his long term problems (job etc) and his son's immediate problems of tiredness (he notices his son's tiredness time to time, but can't do anything abt it)",

I was born in 1960, and considering the year this film was made, I must tell you that the only reason I took the time to watch it was because I was trying to shorten a list of movies I'm just curious about and that made it to the top 250. Up to now, I've felt terribly disappointed by the Hollywood crap of the '40s the '50s and part of the '60s and the '70s, and I mean how unrealistic films were. For example \"Gone with the wind\" is nothing but UNREAL CRAP, and the same can be said about the \"Bridge under the river Kwai\" (and even a sort of recent remake called \"To end all wars\" is also quite unreal, though in a way I shall not discuss here), and the same goes for most of the movies at that time. Unreal, unreal, unreal. Still they won Oscars! Jee! There are a few exceptions which are Stanley Kubric's work and some mild exceptions as Doctor Shivago, but again... they couldn't be more unreal. So... back to \"Ladri di biciclette\" I was nicely surprised to find out how REAL and POSSIBLE its script was. De Sica was undoubtedly with his feet on the ground when he did this. Besides, Lamberto Maggiorani's performance is simply ASTOUNDING. The film, of course, can't be compared to anything of the recent best, however, it comes quite close, and the second half of the film catches your attention quite well. The flick is decently short; it does not include any unnecessary material to make it unnecessary longer... What else can I say? I must recommend this film. It's not the best I've seen, but all in all it undoubled deserves a watch, if only for the sake of knowledge.",

Set in post-WWII, in the crowded and bustling city of Rome, we focus on the lives of an average, middle class Italian family who is trying to survive amidst thousands of other, desperate Italians. The beginning of the movie sees our protagonist, Antonio, seeking work amidst a competitive group of variously qualified but equally desperate men. When the job requires that Antonio has a bike, he and his wife sell all they can to purchase a valuable bicycle. Unfortunately, as the title suggests, Antonio's bike is quickly stolen away during one of his shifts; and so begins the story of searching. In addition to examining the lives and the struggle of everyday Italians during this time period, we also must examine ourselves, as the film brings up questions such as: are acts of crime justified? What makes someone more justified than another to steal something from someone else? Etc. Most importantly, Bicycle Thieves is captivating because it poses the vital question, what would I do in this situation?

            "content": "Set in Italy after the second world war, Bicycle thieves is an example of Neo-Realism Italian cinema, looking at broken Italy and its broken people trying to survive in poverty.From the opening shot we can see Antonio Ricci as lost all hope. He is in the margins of society and suddenly there is a job opening for putting up posters that requires having a bicycle. However he has no bike, he pawned it. His wife Maria pawns their bed sheets and uses the money to get the bicycle back.For the first time in a long time Antonio believes life is on the up. With the wages and the family allowance he reckons he can look after his family. He finally has hope.This hopes come crashing down when his bicycle is stolen by an opportunistic thief and he searches all over Rome with his son Bruno looking for the bike and thief.Antonio gets increasingly desperate in the search for his bike, by the end he is humiliated and fatalistic. See Antonio almost get knocked over by a truck he does not care.There is a key scene at a restaurant with his son where Bruno eats a pizza and drinks water and Bruno sees a wealthy family eating a sumptuous lunch. Antonio explains to him how important this job was and the money he was going to make meaning he could afford treats like this for the family.Antonio may not had been good in his job but the film explored the men who were marginalized in Italian working class society and it was their wives who had to be practical in order for the families to survive.This is a raw film it is not an easy watch, you suffer as Antonio goes on his fruitless search and you will him to steal a nearby bike and just ride off.",

            "content": "Looking through his career, I note I've seen about ten of De Sica's directorial efforts, mostly Italian. Surprisingly also, I found he was directing movies even during World War 2, all through the Fascist period in Italy. At the end of the war, of course, the world had been changed \u2013 and unhappily for many, they were left destitute, poverty-stricken and with little hope for a better life.And that's the thematic core of this movie: a man's desperate search for the means to escape from the enervating poverty which pervades Italian society soon after the guns become silent. Most viewers would sympathize with any person on such a quest. De Sica, however, subverts viewers expectations with a fundamentally flawed character, Antonio (played by Lamberto Maggiorani) \u2013 Mr Everyday Ordinary Italian Citizen \u2013 who, after having his bike stolen, desperately searches his neighborhood over a weekend to find it \u2013 and dragging his young son Bruno (Enzi Staiola) along with him as helper... but also as an emotional crutch for himself. Did I say flawed? Antonio is so inept, so much a klutz, he can't wake up to find a job; he can't even perform a simple task; and he can't even keep his eye on his highly prized and expensive bike to prevent it being stolen.Some would regard such a story as bland; and it is when regarded as just one man's inability to succeed against the odds. However, Antonio's quest could be viewed through another lens: as a symbol for a whole country struggling to regain its wealth after twenty long years of Fascism and war. Sure, it's a story about two bicycle thieves and what happens to them. Clearly, however, as the plot proceeds, De Sica shows there could be and probably are a great many bicycle thieves throughout the society \u2013 but all posing as upright, honest citizens. Why else would De Sica make such a movie, bring such an apparently ordinary story to a full-length, feature film?In doing so, though, the story crystallizes and reinforces the bullying, strong-arm tactics of the Fascists with scenes of mobs; of caricatured actors practicing a musical score amidst grinding poverty; of a compliant church and priests wringing their hands (one being a young Sergio Leone); of police fatalism about crime; and of a victim \u2013 Antonio \u2013 squeezed into an invisible, intolerable vice. To that extent, this movie is an implicit attack on the whole Fascist era and the destruction it wrought upon the entire country. Fortunately, it was Pier Paulo Pasolini who finally executed the polemical, cinematic coup-de-grace to Fascism with his release of Salo (1975) \u2013 an horrific satire that is definitely NOT for the easily-offended or the faint-hearted.Do see Bicycle Thieves, however. It's a flawless production and made better with the use of real places in Rome, using real, inexperienced people as actors. It's also still the stuff of real life for hundreds of millions, even today, in many parts of the world.Give this nine out of ten. Highly recommended.February 4, 2014",

            "content": "This Italian film I was determined to watch because I had heard the title somewhere before, not just being listed in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. Basically, set after the end of World War II in Rome, Italy, unemployed and poor father Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) has finally found a job, sticking up posters of Rita Hayworth around town. Part of the job is that he must have a bicycle, but on the first day of working he is devastated to have it stolen, and there is little the police can do about it. The only way he can see finding his transport is for him and his young son Bruno (Enzo Staiola) to walk the streets of the city in hope of finding either The Thief (Vittorio Antonucci) or of course the bicycle. After so many useful and not so useful sources for finding the man responsible for the theft or the location of the bicycle, Ricci does finally catch The Thief, but with no evidence of his crime. In the end Ricci was not able to get his own bicycle back, and there was a point when he tried to steal one himself, but the man who it belongs to sees Bruno and does not press charges, all they can do is walk home in despair. Also starring Lianella Carell as Maria Ricci, Elena Altieri as The Charitable Lady, Gino Saltamerenda as Baiocco and Fausto Guerzoni as Amateur Actor. Maggiorani is not a professional leading actor, but he makes a nice and sympathetic character, and Staiola is cute as his son, it is a near enough simple story mixing the urban environment and humanism, and there are some good moments of camera-work, it is a most watchable social drama. It won the Oscar Honorary Award, and it was nominated for Best Writing, Screenplay, and it won the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film. Very good!",

            "content": "Bicycle Thieves initially struck me as being much more famous than it deserves. I will admit that for a good portion of the film I found myself wondering why it is such a well known classic. Then again, I'm not exactly an expert on Italian Neorealism so that may have something to do with it. One thing that really caught my attention right away was how well the film captured the desperation of the out of work masses. I live in central eastern China at the moment, in a relatively small city of a mere 6.5 million people, and everywhere I look I see similar circumstances. Especially in the countryside, it's frightening to see how poor these people are.The film tells an incredibly moving story about the life of a poor family using an extremely effective but amazingly simple plot device, a stolen bicycle. In my life I have probably had half a dozen or so bicycles stolen from me, and it's such a sinking and sickening feeling, that for a while I wondered if maybe a stolen bicycle was the original inspiration for the story.Indeed, the after effects are captured flawlessly. The instant desperation, the frantic searching, the fleeting certainty that you'll be able to recover the lost bike, and the gradual and crushing realization that that is never going to happen. Even after filing a police report and doing everything possible to find it, the world is filled with millions of bicycles. As \"the one who sees\" explains, \"Find it right away or you never will.\"The story boils a man down to the singular need of that bicycle in order to provide with his family, and when it is taken from him we witness all of the above changes in him, along with the gradual increasing of his desperation until he ultimately reaches the conclusion that many of us were waiting for all along, and yet dread to see when it actually happens. All along he only wants to provide for his family, and yet ultimately he is forced to do something that he despises, and clearly isn't very good at. The helplessness and uselessness of the police is surely a statement that Hitchcock would have loved, and also says something about the plight of people in his situation. Even in a situation when he was sure he knew who had stolen his bicycle, and who had even run away from him minutes before, he was told by a police officer that he had no proof and was then ridiculed by an entire neighborhood in front of his son. Sadly, there is no real conclusion to the man's story, because there is no easy ending in his life either. It is interesting to consider the meaning behind the lack of closure. Obviously, it is a closer representation of real life this way, but there is also a point when Antonio, the main character, muses briefly but powerfully on his situation, giving the film a whole new depth - \"There's a cure for everything - except death.\"",

Our hero is Antonio Ricci, married has a wife and a kid and gets a job that needs a bicycle. He affords a bicycle and it's stolen now his run to get it back makes the whole movie. He devises ways, catches in fact the thief too, but did he succeed? See it to know it. We all know, that a heart once lost cannot be found again and a life once lost can never be gained again. But if we lose a bicycle, there is a hope of getting it again and it's proved here that hope drives a human being more than anything else.The movie camera moves to and fro into the frames to bring in emotions out of the extremely heart broken but still hopeful Ricci and camera itself acts as a character by bringing out the milieu of the times and the locales. What beautiful thing to know that times then were so very hopeless and still hope is what drove everything in each one.It's easily one of best directed and acted films that has no histrionics but simple plain real life portrayals. The music is simple and there is not much to edit in the movie which means it's perfect as it is. Loved, the way it was made, it was then un compromisingly made and hats off to that.Easily one of the best movies ever. It's 5/5.",

God save me from having to sit through \"Ivan the Terrible, Part II\" again. And \"Pickpocket!\" This one was shot on the cheap by Vittorio De Sica -- no professional actors, no fancy gimmicks, no back projection, no money, no nothing. Sid Caesar did a parody on his TV show. Yet De Sica's pulled it off. An unpromising story about a poor man and his little son searching all of Rome for their stolen bicycle on which their livelihood depends is truly engaging.It's post-war Italy and almost everyone is broke. People pawn their used linens to add a little to their pitiful government allowance. Nobody drives a car. There are a few crowded old buses and trolleys but the streets are full of bicycles. Antonio Ricci is lucky to have a bicycle. He's just found a job putting up posters and he's proud of it. His wife has sewn a military cap for him as part of a shabby jump-suit uniform. He needs the bicycle to get back and forth to work.But while he's slapping up a poster advertising a Rita Hayworth movie on the wall of the Hotel Florida, a young thief jumps on the bicycle and pedals quickly away.The rest of the movie follows Ricci and his son as they roam the city looking for the bicycle and the thief. They don't find it, not even with the help of sympathetic friends and the police. Finally, out of desperation, Ricci spots another bicycle leaning lazily against a wall, cases the situation, and takes off on the bike. He's caught by a crowd of pedestrians and released -- defeated, filled with remorse and shame.Two things leave an indelible impression on the viewer. One is the faces. Where did De Sica find these features? All of them are distinctive in one way or another. One, a musician, has a head like a chubby balloon and eyes that extrude from their sockets, as in a cartoon.The second thing is the tour of the seedier parts of Rome that we're subjected to while Ricci searches the streets. There's a tiny, shabby theater in which a handful of untalented performers are doing a clumsy song and dance number. There is a soup kitchen preceded by a prayer, and one of the bums complains, \"I sat through the service; I'm entitled to the soup.\" A Thieve's Market, a neighborhood full of toughs, a decrepit police station out of Kafka, overflowing with piles of paper.In the context of all this local color, the plight of Ricci and his young son sometimes recedes into the background although it's never forgotten. By the end, you ache for Ricci to find that damned bicycle but, as with so many other of our visions, his wish is never realized.",

Try to take your eyes off Ricci and his son, Bruno, as scene after scene turns hopefulness into despair then abject humiliation. Yes, Bicycle Thief is a political film, and its characters do represent a war-torn Italy deciding its fate(metaphorically, Ricci without his Bicycle; and literally, the Socialist agitators meeting in the basement along side community entertainers).  But should we care about that now?  Politics and emerging regimes in Bicycle Thief wisely take a backseat to the urgent problems of joblessness and \"feeding the kid\".  In that respect, the only comparable US film is Ford's \"Grapes of Wrath\".  Tom Joad and Antonio Ricci may be caught in different stories, but they have a lot in common.  Politics aside, Bicycle Thief's script is concise, unsentimental and its power still resonates.  The black and white photography, capturing Rome in its ancient and more recent state of post-WWII decay, is often breathtaking.  Editing and directing are flawless -- Bicycle Thief flows like a scary, poverty-stricken nightmare, and then delivers one of world-cinema's greatest closing images.  Do not miss this perfect film.",

But at least I don't put on an act about it. If you want to see all the people who praise this movie's realism really turn out in force and put their feet where their mouths lie, go to a screening of \"On the Bowery\" or \"Salt of the Earth\" or a movie like that and you're sure to find yourself the lone ticket-holder in a sea of empty seats.So don't be put off by all the critical bleating about what a great \"slice of life\" this picture is. I'm happy to say it's nothing of the sort. In fact, it's one of the most entertaining movies of the 1940s, so superbly photographed, so visually stunning, so melodiously scored, so cleverly and ingeniously scripted, so lavishly produced and brilliantly directed, it's a joy and a pleasure to view again and again.Thank God, the script of \"Bicycle Thieves\" is so beautifully contrived, bringing in marvelously bizarre vignettes and fascinatingly picaresque cameos.

Well, for one thing, it's his little claim on Italy's shattered post-war economy. Without it, he and his little family don't eat. Besides, with the bike and the poster-hanging job that goes with it, he's got dignity and can brag to his young son Bruno. So, for the next 90 minutes of screen time, he's one determined guy to get it back.It's not like he doesn't have help. His friends fan out, looking here and there, the market- place, the streets. Probably, the bike's in parts now, anyway, like an auto chop-shop. But Ricci doesn't care. By golly, he's going to find whatever is left. After all, the bike is now more than a mere bike. The trouble is there are so darn many of them everywhere you look. It's like trying to find the proverbial drop in the ocean. Worse still are the crowds, everywhere you look, going who knows where. Just as bad, what do they care about his problem since they probably have their own. We know that from the big mob of guys scrambling for work at the beginning. Talk about frustration! All I can say is that President Truman better get the Marshall Plan working or desperate guys like Ricci are going to vote in the Communists, a real possibility in 1948.Now, some folks may find the movie kind of boring since there's no hint of Hollywood glamour or action anywhere, except on a movie poster. Besides, what's all that suspense over something like a cheap bike. But seeing all the real people's faces is unusual and interesting, along with the city streets even though the buildings there are crumbling and ugly. All in all, it looks like this is what you could call a slice-of-life movie, the kind that tells you a lot about other times and places. But more importantly, it says something about things in general\u2014namely, that sometimes a bike is not just a bike, that there's probably a bit of a bicycle thief in all of us, and that sometimes you have to keep pressing ahead even when the world's seemingly against you .

It even makes you care about the bicycle and you want to help the protagonist find the bicycle. The ending is just PERFECT. The guilt on Antonio's face in the end is depressing and the child's acting is great. I think I gave it a 9 because the film's effect has declined as it takes place in Post war Italy. At that time, Italy was very poor but now a modern viewer does not feel that much about it. You can clearly see that in Sight and See's polls about the greatest films ever made. In the first poll it was at top and now in the latest poll it is at 33 ( I don't consider critics to be always right about a film but I agree with them on this).

Enzio manages to give himself completely to the role despite the fact that neither he nor the man playing his father were professional actors. Director Vittorio DeSica gets masterful performances from both of them, especially in rich moments when the relationship falters and then picks up again as the day goes on and their bond increases.The scenes of crowded streets of Rome and the poverty that existed for so many of its citizens are masterfully depicted by the camera, so much so that the film is almost a documentary of life and a time capsule of the period.Despite the abruptness of the downbeat ending, it's the sort of film that leaves you thinking about the characters long after the film is over.

            "content": "Despite this movie's strong placement in the annals of those deemed \"classics\", I was a bit hesitant to check it out because I'm not the biggest fan of neorealism, and, strangely enough, a lot of my friends with opinions I respect really didn't like it. I've got to say that I'm going to have to side with those who call it a classic this time around. More specifically, I've never before seen a neorealist film I would ever have called \"gripping\" and I've not seen any neorealist film as good since \"Roma, citta apperta\".Let me quickly go through some of the myths and the more popular interpretations: it is true that the movie completely revolves around a man and his son searching for the man's stolen bicycle, but it is not true at all that there's nothing else to it. More specifically, it's about the man's relationship with his son as a main theme and an exploration of post-war Rome as subtext. It is true that it has quite a lot of communist themes placed through-out, but honestly those themes are entirely engulfed in the much more personal, tragic aspects of the movie. The more poignant political commentary is in the way the plot works, where people are forced to own property--a certain type of property--in order to get a job and thus get more property. Truly you can't blame the movie for that, because it has a point.What this movie is really good at is shifting the emotions of the viewers to match those felt by the protagonist Antonio Vicci. The movie quickly establishes the importance of the bicycle and its emotional value to Vicci. The search itself is desperate, but it is given depth by the relationship of Antonio to Bruno, his son. As the two of them share a love for the bike and a need to retrieve it, they also share a shifting and dynamic relationship to each other that runs from full support to quiet alienation and everything in between. The strongest moments in the film are the ones in which their relationship seem the most damaged. The father eventually must depend on the son to share his pain.In terms of the concept of neorealism itself, it's debatable where this movie fits. The most clear features of it are its focus on class struggle, a taste of the melodrama, and a plot lead on by a simple, singular desire. However, the production values are much higher than the famed \"Roma, citta apperta\", and at this point de Sica is well established as an auteur working under the awareness of a more popular and mainstream international audience. Genre debates aside, it's a strong film that well deserves its lasting appreciation, no matter how many people find it boring or disagree with its politics.--PolarisDiB",

            "content": "This movie can be interpreted and viewed in many different ways. Most people praise the movie for its father-son relationship in it but to me the movie was an adventure through town, in which the main character encounters the many different social layers of post-war Italy. after his bicycle got stolen and he spends the entire weekend looking back for it, since he needs th bicycle or else he'll loose his new job. It basically is a great and honest portrayal of life in post-war Italy for a common man, who tries hard to find and eventually keep his job, to support himself and his family. It's not a movie that tries to bloom things or follows the usual standard common rules of cinema. It's an early neorealistic movie, in which director Vittorio De Sica used only amateurs to give a realistic and honest portrayal of life.It's a great social and character study. Through his travels through town he visits all kinds of places and meets people from the different society layers. A great study of post-war Italy. The main character himself also isn't without his flaws, which can also be seen back in the father-son relationship within the movie. It's a real honest and straight-forward movie that also shows how far some people are willing to go to get what they want. A great character study.But yes I do agree that the movie is perhaps a tad bit too overrated. Sure it's great and appreciate all the movie tried to achieve but it also isn't an easy movie to watch, due to the low pace and just not being interesting enough at times. It still rate this movie high but I don't think I agree that this movie is deserving his spot in all of the top movie-list and also don't really consider this to be an absolute must-see or classic.Having said that \"Ladri di biciclette\" is just a great movie. To be honest I was surprised that it got made with amateurs and some sequences were also obviously improvised on the spot. The movie really doesn't look and feel as if it mostly involved amateurs and this also really goes for the acting within the movie.Even though it perhaps is not the must-see, or influential movie, everyone wants to make you believe it is, it still is one great unique movie which most certainly is worth watching.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "Now I can tick another acknowledged masterpiece off my watch-list, De Sica's timeless Neo- realism opus comprises of a non-professional cast, sternly portrays a grim reality of the post- WWII Italy, sets in a three-days span, Antonio (Maggiorani) is fortuitous enough to procure a job of pasting posters (Rita Hayworth's lionized poster of GILDA 1946) among the massive unemployed, but a bicycle is a prerequisite to secure the job, it is a luxury for his impoverished family, anyhow, they sell the bedsheets and get a bicycle, it seems that everything is going to be on the right track! A brief interlude happens when his wife Maria (Carell) detours to visit a seer to remunerate her prophecy, Antonio leaves his new bicycle downstairs and asks some kids playing around to keep an eye on it, then he goes upstairs to find out who is the mysterious woman Maria is visiting, it is an ingenious ploy to incite curiosities of whether the bicycle will be stolen or not, and forebodes the negligence later in the film, the bicycle is nicked in the first day of his work. Instead of going back home to be enveloped in Maria's whine and fault-finding, Antonio is a man of action, he contacts his friends for help and the next day, with his elder boy Bruno (Staiola), they roam around Rome and try to find the thief, which we all know is a long shot and it dooms to be a long day. From patrolling the recycling market to pursue a beggar who is in contact with the thief in the church, all the effort turns out to be fruitless, during the church scenes, there is trenchant allusion of religion's sanctimoniousness, it is no more than a relief station while justice is never an option for a non-believer. Antonio brings Bruno for a treat despite of all the frustrations, it is also a guilty compensation after his harsh behavior towards the innocent boy, the contrast between Bruno and a rich boy in the restaurant is glaringly affecting, it is when an idea comes to Antonio's mind, out of desperation, he resorts to the seer, to something he gives no credence, and after a bragging twaddle like \"you will only find it now or never\", ironically, right after he leaves the seer's building, the suspect is precisely walking in front of his eyes. Then things come to a maddening climax, without clear evidence and with the aid of a throng of protective neighbors, the thief amateurishly fakes a seizure to earn onlooker's compassion, even the policeman cannot help Antonio to arrest the miscreant. In the last resort, Antonio commits the theft to a bicycle, but he is outrun by the masses chasing him and to his mortification, Bruno witnesses everything with sobbed eyes, pragmatically, he is let off the hook, at least the world shows some mercy in the end, the ending sees Antonio and Bruno walk along with the stream of people, the future is unbeknown to them. Enzo Staiola is naturally endearing as the precocious son to whom audiences will ceaselessly project their empathy, brilliantly cast, so it Lamberto Maggiorani, adheres to life but seethes with anxiety. Alessandro Cicognini's pensive score is sometimes obtrusive but consistently emotive, and Carlo Montuori's cinematography enriches the misery with visceral intensity by shedding light on the close-ups to indicate characters' inner states. The film is a substantiated indictment for inequity which permeates the society ingrainedly, it doesn't extol the image of Italians after WII, but it never demonize them either, most of the people are from the struggled class, the moral ambiguity is a blockade to condemn them since life is not easy for any of them. First and foremost the film's sociological study on humanism enshrined itself as unsurpassable opus in the entire film history and its appeal is purely timeless.",

            "content": "In this third world the majority of us inhabit, we live in a society in which it has become almost normal to be a single mother with the overwhelming responsibility of children. It is a world in which a mother has become associated with the false ideas of having an unsurpassable bond with her child\u0085 a bond that is untouched\u0085 a bond that is envied. This is a shame, but luckily it is only an idea that has been perpetuated by the media, disillusioned government recognitions and poor clich\u00e9 ridden films \u0096 often with a strong Class undertone. Ladri Di Biciclette tells of another side of this contemporary notion, it tells of a fathers bond with his child and how this bond is called upon to uphold the family.The film really is beautiful and I would go so far as to call it a true work of art. Ladri Di Biciclette manages to deconstruct what some would see as chauvinist values - and in such a way that we really appreciate the male prerequisite of fatherhood. The plot incorporates the male lead with such precision that we, the audience, feel his every dilemma\u0085 his every decision\u0085 his every emotion. We also bond with the child to such an extent that we really share his tears. But then anyone really interested in viewing this film will at least be familiar with the pictures of the neo-realist genre and its attributes, so all these experiences are to be expected and this picture does not fail to deliver. I would even be bold enough to say that this film is the best film of the genre (although if interest in neo-realism you should also see Umberto D & Stromboli)\u0085 to further that\u0085 this is the best film I've ever seen! Ladri Di Biclette touched a cord with me and if it doesn't with you then pay a visit to the circus because you must be made of stone.",

The film is rightly celebrated for its naturalism, although the story is essentially a shaggy-dog tale, and the primitive state of film-making 70 years ago cannot be totally ignored: the camera is just so much less proactive than on modern movies.

            "content": "The Bicycle Thief has long been considered one of the greatest Italian neo-realist films, if not one of the greatest films ever. There is little that is visually stimulating; it is mostly shot with natural light and long sequences take place in the empty streets of Rome. Yet, it is a completely engrossing picture if only because it sets up the story so well. A man struggles to provide for his wife and young son and gets an opportunity but needs a bicycle. He gets one by hocking his bedsheets. Now, he feels life will be better, until on a busy side street it is stolen and lost in a crowd.Vittorio De Sica was originally an actor, and he obviously had a good eye for casting, deciding to go with all amateur actors, which brought a whole other dimension to the world of post-World War II Italy. These actors portraying the father and son are so real, so effective in close-ups and action sequences that it is almost like a documentary following them around the city. It is quite riveting to see a man fight the elements, which is something all can relate to; we feel for this man and understand why he would do the things he does.Desperation becomes part of him as time goes on, and the ending is surprising as it is understandable. This film speaks to all of us; it tells the story of people trying to survive and overcome the most precarious of situations: in this case, people. Life was tough then and it still is. Although this may seem as a depressing film, it actually has a message of hope. This film passes on the message that humans are incredible individuals; pressing on to overcome obstacles at any cost.",

            "content": "Featuring unprofessional actors in starring roles, shot in real locations with no studio sets & using only natural light to capture its drama, Bicycle Thieves (also known as Ladri di Biciclette) is one of the finest & most influential films to come out from Italian Cinema and is amongst the first films that brought neorealism into the world of motion picture filmmaking.Set in poverty-stricken Rome in post-World War II Italy, the story of Bicycle Thieves concerns a poor father who's scavenging for any kind of work to support his family. Having secured a job after selling his precious possessions to buy a bicycle which is required to carry out the work, the future looks promising but his whole world is turned upside down when someone steals his bicycle.Co-written & directed by Vittorio De Sica, Bicycle Thieves provides an unblinking glimpse into the daily life of civilians in post-war Italy but where it makes its strongest impact is in the devastating portrait of human spirit crushed by desperation. The screenplay keep the conversations as natural as possible and shows that when it comes to poverty, everyone is a victim & how desperation has the ability to corrupt even the most ethical minds.Shot in black n white, the camera splendidly captures every moment from start to finish and both the real locations as well as natural lighting only add more realism to the story. Editing also makes sure there are no dull moments once the main plot surfaces & its 93 minutes of runtime is briskly paced. And the untrained actors bring a high-level of authenticity to their given roles plus express their emotions in a very convincing manner.On an overall scale, despite being nearly 70 years old, Bicycle Thieves remains as relevant today as it was back in its time. Even from a visual perspective, this film has only aged like wine plus the themes it deals with and the unforgettable statement it makes during its final moments are only timeless & universal. Absolutely living up to its legacy & unaffected by the test of time, Bicycle Thieves is an essential cinema that deserves every bit of its recognition for it is truly one of the greatest achievements in filmmaking history. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "Throughout the '40s, '50s and early '60s Italian neo-realism was a strongpoint of European cinema. Few films came close to capturing the authenticity and bleak visual delight of which Italian neo-realism offered. The Bicycle Thief is a primary example of Italian neo-realism and defines the genre as a whole.The Bicycle Thief (or to some The Bicycle Thieves) depicts the story of a father and son's fascinating relationship. The story revolves around a poor man named Antonio Ricci who after being unemployed for two years gains a job. Of course he is ecstatic about becoming employed, yet he needs a bike as this is primary for his job of putting up posters. So he pawns some essential possessions in return for the bike, hoping to pay back for them with the job. Alas, on his first day his bike gets stolen; from here on the film follows the Antonio and his son's search for the bike.The Bicycle Thief is certainly not an upbeat film; rather it is a depressing slice of honest realism of how cruel the world really is. The film studies many aspects of human behaviour during desperate situations. On the surface The Bicycle Thief is a simple story, but once you start looking at the film closer you will notice an important social-commentary, a truly absorbing subtext and a sincere study of emotions.It is amazing just how well The Bicycle Thief has developed over time, still remaining poignant, affecting and heart-breaking in its outlook on society and life. The film asks questions of morals, such as \"does Antonio care more about his job than his family?\" or \"does he care about his job for his family?\" The film is so enthralling and challenging that it is open to different interpretations from the moralistic point of view. The film's power has not lost its force and ability to bring even the most strong of viewers to let out their pity for the characters we know only too well. It is sad when you realise that there are millions of people today in the same situation, trying so hard to make a decent living yet failing miserably.Another element which makes the film so professional and startlingly realistic is due to how the entire cast is based around almost all unprofessional actors and actresses. The acting is very direct and it is impossible not to pity the characters that you have grown to love throughout the film. The acting from the child is truly magnificent and is without-a-doubt one of the finest child performances of all-time, the child slides himself inside his role capturing the loss of innocence and deprivation he is growing-up around. The film's poetic and angry script echoes the protagonists' emotions and centres itself around them with a blissful ease. Director Vittorio De Sica constantly lays bare the lives of the everyday Italian from the film's period, making it a relatable film for the people the genuine lives that have been filmed. Vittorio De Sica is a master at his art, making films about the people and for the people. His messages on Italian life on politics still echo their force today.The consistent element of class-struggle is endorsed into the film's fluid narrative. The haunting and charming scene in the pizzeria shows the difference in classes and the Antonio's devotion to his son, possibly my favourite scene in the entire film. It is heartbreaking to see how money is always on Antonio's mind. He realises whenever he uses his money he is taking a risk and can barely afford the \"luxury\" of eating out, yet he wants his son to be happy. There are so many questions the film asks its viewers and so it deserves to be analysed. I can honestly say if you do not feel the slightest impact of The Bicycle Thief then I would question if you are truly human! The film captures the gritty feel of the streets of Rome through a stark and dirty vision. The camera sympathetically and delicately lays bare the lifestyle of the poverty-stricken citizens. It embroils all the elements of life in the city, fluidly capturing the sadness in the lives of people who have very little in life. When looked at today, The Bicycle Thief is a film that makes the viewer realise just how lucky you are and how people take modern lifestyle essentials for granted. The eloquently effective score captures the environment and character tones with an elegant aura, beautifully accompanying the scenes.The Bicycle Thief remains one of the most thoughtfully intelligent social-commentaries of all-time, offering countless revisits. Cinematic perfection, celluloid is rarely as perfect as The Bicycle Thief.",

            "content": "Vittorio De Sica's The Bicycle Thief (Ladri Di Biciclette), made in 1948, in black and white, is one of the all time great films, and, in its Neo-realistic cinema verit\u00e9 simplicity, it shows how utterly creatively bankrupt most film-making these days is. And by that I mean worldwide, not just the obvious flaws of the Hollywood crap factory. Lean, spare, poetic- it tells one story, but tells it very well, and that story becomes universal, and is applicable to all people who have ever suffered, or been driven to do desperate things. Its screenplay is deceptively slight, but that does not mean it is not great. Oftentimes, it is assumed that a great screenplay must be witty like Woody Allen films, deep like Ingmar Bergman films, or characteristically complex like Robert Altman films, but great screenplays can also be the antithesis of those things. A great screenplay may be like that in Stanley Kubrick's for 2001: A Space Odyssey, full of symbolism writ large, and on the other hand, it can be like The Bicycle Thief, which is symbolic precisely because it is so intensely personal.The film is almost pitch perfect from beginning to end, yet, as often happens, something is lost in the translation of its title, Ladri Di Biciclette, which literally means Bicycle Thieves, but in America is known as The Bicycle Thief. The original title is more literally true, as both the 'real' thief and Antonio, steal bikes, and it also allows for a deeper look at their differing motivations. When we see the original thief's one room apartment- with mother and two other siblings- we see that he, too, is poor, and we have to wonder if he is Antonio on the future, with just a bit more desperation. Yes, he's obviously a skilled con man, but he may have started out pure, as well. This deeper look is lost in the Americanized title, for while technically Antonio is a thief, he is truly forced into it, lest his family will be even more degraded, while the young thief is likely merely using external circumstances to justify his black soul. De Sica wisely does not opt out for that simplistic end, though, for we still have the contrast between the professional thief, and the rank amateur, Antonio.Many critics have reduced this film to De Sica's supposed refutation of a simple false dualism- that De Sica is merely trying to show good and evil are relative, but the film clearly is NOT doing that, for we know, all along, that the young professional thief would likely be a con man regardless. All of his neighbors are cheats and liars, as he has likely been accused many times before, and even his mother lies for her manifestly guilty son. De Sica recognizes that there IS good and evil, but that sometimes an act that appears evil- such as thievery, can be born of different circumstances; pure evil and greed, as in the case of the young thief, and mere desperation, as with Antonio. Ironically, many of the critics who chide viewers for their supposed biases against the young thief, show their own biases in wholly missing De Sica's actual point- which is not to show that there are differing reasons for similar acts, but that the reasons CAN be night and day, yet still be confused, and that usually, and regardless, it is the honest who are screwed either way.Even worse, are those stolid critics with a political ax to grind. Marxists somehow got it into their heads that Antonio, who is clearly shown as living in squalor, is a member of the bourgeoisie, simply because he wears a fedora, not a cap, or because his wife has clean bedsheets, thus when he gets a job, it is symbolic of governmental favoritism for an elite class, and the young bike thief, who wears a German hat, is a member of the international proletariat, although he clearly is a member of the criminal class, and in that conflation much of Marxist theology bogs down. The theft of Antonio's bike is therefore claimed as a revolutionary act, and his lying neighbors are just good workers defending a comrade. That Antonio is left bereft, at film's end, to Marxists, symbolizes a perverse justice. To point out all the ridiculous flaws in such super-simplistic ideas would waste time, but, clearly, the only reason such absurd claims were made were because the screenwriter, Cesare Zavattini, who adapted the film from a novel by Luigi Bartolini, was a member of the Italian Communist Party, at the time. Interestingly, the film has also been seen as a very Conservative film, praised by Christian groups and even William F. Buckley's The National Review, not because it delineates good and evil, as described above, but because they see it as a refutation of Marxist ideals, in that Antonio and the other laborers do not find work degrading, but a fundament of their self worth; so much so that when the young thief kyboshes Antonio's ability to gain that self respect, he loses all hope, and is reduced to dishonesty himself.Neither reductivist outlook adequately deals with the many subtleties and nuances this great film portrays, and the fact that The Bicycle Thief is shorn of Freudian psychobabble and preaching is one of its strengths. Yet, it is not pure cinema, either, as many European critics have labeled it. Although the visuals convey the milieu well, they do not get inside the characters. This is where the writing and acting ability of Maggiorani and Staiola works magic. Great art is simply not so easily reducible as political panderers want it to be, and one can be thankful for that, lest The Bicycle Thief would not be what it is, nor would we still be watching it with such easy appreciation for its simple virtues.",

Each scores a perfect ten on my ratings; of which only 29 other films have achieved a perfect score, out of over 20000 films that I have seen. This is probably even better than Shoeshine because it contains a father-son relationship which is a bit more dramatic than two friends in Shoeshine. This makes DeSica the greatest film director in the history of Italian cinema. His neoralism films are among the best ever made. Any serious student of film should make this a must-see experience.

Apparently the voice you hear of the leading man, the \"man without a label\" as the screenwriter calls him, is actually dubbed by a different actor. I could not distinguish this idea at all during my viewing, so it didn't break the illusion of the movie.The movie may only capture the events a tight time-span (two days or less), but it does it marvelously. I'll admit there is not too much going on after the man's bike is stolen and he and his son walk around Rome trying to find it, but there is a wonderful scene that depicts the class struggle where the man and his son eat at a restaurant and the man explains the importance of the bike. The boy sees a wealthier kid enjoying the luxury of melted cheese on his sandwich whereas the two characters at the center of the story have to have basic sandwiches due to their shortcomings. It is a simple, yet powerful scene.This film deals with harsh realities as the dad is unable to ever retrieve his bike - the boy who stole it probably having sold the parts before he could get to it. It is also such a powerful and shocking ending with what the protagonist decides to do, and with the kid holding his father's hand at the conclusion of the film, it is an action that shows they are now equals. They seem to be doomed to live in poverty, and the man has shown what it truly takes to survive in this dog eat dog world.",

            "content": "Bicycle Thieves (1948) :\nBrief Review -Bicycle is lost but Life is found. A doctrinal Italian Classic. It follows a story of the poor father searching for his stolen bicycle in post-World War II Rome, without which he will lose the job which was to be the salvation of his young family. Do you remember the old formula we always talk about, that one life changing noir thing? I say it begun here. Bicycle Thieves is just not a cinematic classic but by far a very important film for everyone especially the poor ones who struggle for the livelihood daily. For the time of it's release it just seems like an unbeaten and influential classic noir. The film is about 99 minutes long and there are hardly any moments to skip even in repeat watch. The content is super strong already and the narrative is very tight therefore the film hooks you from the beginning scene till the last scene where you end up with a life lesson and can't move yourself for a moment. Vittorio De Sica made this film in the time when it was most needed and i have no doubts that it had definitely worked like a life tonic for the people who have lost everything in thier lives. It just evokes you to not awake the evil inside you even if the situation is worst and you're feeling like lost everything. Lamberto Maggiorani as Antinio and Enzo Staiola as his kid Bruno make a great pair on screen and make thier presence feel. The best thing about the film is it's writing and the presentation with no loop holes or useless moments. If you ever feel hopeless in your life try catching this film and it might change your perception of looking at that worst period. Because there is always a second chance to make it up everything. I have watched 3 Italian films (Life Is Beautiful and Cinema Paradiso) till date and fortunately all 3 were Classics including this.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

Touching and heart-breaking, it depicts the dramatic post-WWII economic situation in Italy, when ordinary people had to fight poverty and something as simple as a bike could determine the future of a family.That is why, when the precious bike is stolen, we can literally feel the desperation of a man whose life and that of his dear ones literally depends on that bike. As we follow his journey in search for the stolen bike, we cannot avoid holding our breath hoping he is going to find it and despairing alongside him the moment his (and our) hope shatters.Why 'thieves' and not 'thief'? Because the main character himself attempts, out of desperation, to steal a bike and this makes us wonder whether the original thief might have acted out of desperation too in order to survive in that harsh reality.The ending scene with the little kid crying and taking his father's hand after he has been publicly humiliated and the two walking away together in the crowd is one of the most gut-wrenching you will ever see.The score deserves merits too.",

            "content": "Bicycle Thieves captures, in elemental strokes, the crushing of the human spirit at the hands of poverty, indifference and despair. Yes, it's a titan in the chronicles of cinematic history, but more importantly this is an overwhelmingly moving parable that balances the grimness of its characters' plight against some of the period's most elegant visual poetry.Armed with a story (from a novel by Luigi Bartolini) incredible in its simplicity, it tells the tale of an unemployed worker in postwar Rome who finds a job putting up movie posters after his wife pawns the family sheets to get his bicycle out of hock. But right after he starts work, the bike is stolen. This feels like an apocalyptic turn of events, thanks to the way director Vittorio De Sica and screenwriter Cesare Zavattini have crucially conveyed all that this one bicycle means; the one thing keeping this family from falling into an impoverished abyss. And so the rest of the film, during which the father races all over Rome in search of the bike with his son tagging along, has a riveting intensity. You completely identify with Antonio's desperation, even managing to understand why this proud, dignified man makes an uncharacteristic climactic decision.The picture is a pure exercise in directorial virtuosity. As our man searches for the stolen bicycle, De Sica explores the terrible dehumanization of postwar life and finds that loneliness is its unifying theme. He carefully balances a generally tragic sensibility with a quiet undercurrent of hope, all the while sucking us into the story with the sheer urgency of the search for a stolen bicycle. Bicycle Thieves has a certain simplicity, quietness, and even naivet\u00e9 that are more than welcome as a change from the deafening noise, ingenuity, and hollow sophistication of Hollywood. As the son Bruno, Enzo Staiola is a revelation. His funny face and urchin-like mannerisms make him the star of the film as he plays witness to the joyous and heartbreaking events \u2014 the film's silent narrator. Likewise a greenhorn who turns in a touching performance is Lamberto Maggiorani as Antonio.Playwright Arthur Miller once described this masterpiece as \"It is as though the soul of man had been filmed.\" He couldn't have put it in better words!

            "content": "There are many different theories as to what makes a good film, what makes a film memorable. Every single person will you give you a different set of guidelines as to what separates the masterpieces from your typical, everyday film. In my opinion, one of the strongest necessities towards a really good movie is a fantastic ending. Good, even great movies can be ruined or not as appreciated because of a mediocre or terrible ending. Some of the best films of all-time (in my opinion) finishes on an extremely high note, finishes in a way that allows discussion, allows added praise, builds tears in your eyes, and/or continues providing laughter long after the credits start rolling.Movies like Shawshank Redemption, Finding Nemo, Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, Princess Bride, Rain Man, Empire Strikes Back, among others, are all movies I deem masterpieces. What separates all these from the typical film is that the movie remains consistently good, and then ends on the top of the quality scale. But, there have been great films with bad endings that reduce it to a lower level; Cast Away, Sideways, and Legend of Drunken Master are examples of good movies that could have been even better if they had figured out a decent way to end the flick. This classic suffers from this fate as well; Bicycle Thief is a grand look at post-World War II Italy that ends very abruptly. While on many people's minds its one of the best films of all-time, in my opinion it's just 10 minutes away from perfection, it was oh so close. However, one really can marvel at the cinematography, the realism, and the impact it's delivered to modern film-making.The Bicycle Thief (a.k.a Ladri di biciclette) follows a down-and-out man by the name of Antonio trying to recover his bike, which was stolen during a day at work. Taking his son Bruno, he goes on a long journey through the highs and lows of Italy as he tries to find his bike and the thief who took it. The movie runs deeper than a simple story of a man searching for a bike, this is also a look into the lives of citizens in a post World War II world, in which poverty is widespread, and times are tough. People aren't very nice towards each other, there is hostility throughout, and nobody is willing to stick out their neck for anybody. There is no hero in this tale, just a string of flawed characters trying to survive. Even when the sympathy is aimed towards the main character, it quickly gets snatched away in certain instances when we see his dark side.The quality of this film can be largely and almost wholly attributed to the director, Vittorio De Sica. Using long shots of the city, long shots of the events occurring, the viewer is thrown into the world of injustice, poverty, and hardship. Sica also uses inexperienced actors that can relate to the situation taking place in the film. This decision not only adds a dosage of realism to the piece, but would also influence the later nitty-gritty street films of later decades like The Godfather, Goodfellas, Do the Right Thing, and City of God. He doesn't toy much with the camera, which makes it less Hollywood and more documentary. The hand-held camera look that the movie delivers turns you not into an observer, but more as a witness. The dialogue is also realistic, as the words used throughout the movie remained short, simple, and sweet.There are two things that prevent this from being a golden masterpiece in my standards. First off, the film is just overly depressing from the beginning to the very end. While yes the subject matter is anything but happy, the movie piles sad moment after sad moment after sad moment at you. Sometimes, the sad moments weren't even necessary and come out of left field. If you are going to make a drama, at least throw in a few moments of temporary nirvana, to allow the viewer time to breathe out the negativity. Plus, there's no need to add more drama and tension coming from other, minor characters that serve little importance into the plot. The second and major drawback is the ending. Few people criticize the ending here, but after following depression and unfortunate incidents for 90 minutes, one would hope for an ending that doesn't come out of nowhere. The ending not only abruptly happens, but also doesn't tie up all loose ends, and just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth. Don't want to dwell into details, but the climax and conclusion is supposed to flow like the end of a hill, not like a straight nosebleed dive, which is what happens in The Bicycle Thief. When spending a whole film looking for light at the end of the dark tunnel, you don't want to end the car ride still stuck in the tunnel. Okay, enough comparisons, allusions, and metaphors.Bottom Line: The Bicycle Thief is yet another \"classic\" film that's forgiven for its flaws and setbacks and is considered leagues and mountains above the modern-day film. While yes this movie is good, influential, and a good cultural look at a certain time period in Italy, it's nowhere near perfect. Superb acting, directing, cinematography, editing, and dialogue is all slightly (oh so slightly)marred because the director and screenwriters couldn't come up with a better way to finish this motion picture; it felt like they filmed a bit more of this and just sent an ax towards a random scene during the editing process. A good movie needs a strong ending, and this one couldn't finish on a strong note. It is worth a viewing, but it is not one you are going to keep on the shelves for years to come.",

            "content": "One of the best-known of all the Italian neo-realist thrillers emerging out of the Second World War and beyond, LADRI DI BICICLETTE has a straightforward plot of Ricci, a working-class man (Lamberto Maggiorani) who finds a job as a bill-poster, buys a bicycle and embarks on his task. On his first day the bicycle is stolen, and together with son Bruno (Enzo Staiola), he spends the rest of the film unsuccessfully trying to find it.The simple plot cannot describe the experience of watching Vittorio de Sica's film, whose unforgettable black-and-white photography (by Carlo Montuori) captures a postwar Italy trying to re-establish itself in the wake of a catastrophic war (as signaled by the tower- blocks dotted across the landscape), yet simultaneously experiencing chronic problems of poverty and unemployment. Ricci has to join the daily queue of men hoping for a job from an unscrupulous clerk (Gino Saltamerenda), with no real prospect of permanent positions. As he visits the bill- posting office to receive the posters, the camera focuses on the clerks, who seem to be dealing with piles of paperwork to little or no effect. They are not actually producing anything, but simply working for the sake of working, to avoid Ricci's fate. The same also applies to the officers in the police station, who choose to spend time on clerical duties rather than actively trying to catch criminals.Ricci lives in a cramped couple of rooms with his wife (Lianella Carell) and their young baby. Once again de Sica captures the almost daily sufferings they experience: Maria has to put meals on the table on very little money, while having to cope with the chores of washing, ironing and child-rearing in one room, relying totally on any income Ricci can bring in.This explains Ricci's mental sufferings, once his bicycle has been stolen by a petty thief (Vittorio Antonucci). The film is full of tracking sequences as he walks along peopled streets, devoid of cars, his face framed in close-up as he makes his futile attempts to find it. Bruno tags along behind him, experiencing equal sufferings, especially in a high-class pizza restaurant where his raggedy clothes are contrasted with those of a high-class child sitting behind him, savoring the delights of a calzone and staring loftily at Bruno.Eventually matters come to a heartbreaking climax where the hitherto morally impeccable Ricci is forced into a criminal act. The resultant shame, as he is surrounded by a crowd of indignant bystanders, proves too much for Bruno, as he walks away, his face filled with tears, with his father desperately trying and failing to console him. Once Ricci had been a person to look up to; for Bruno his father is now nothing more than a common felon. Yet we realize that this is not Ricci's fault; it is something that he was forced into by adverse circumstances.Only eighty minutes in length - on the DVD release - LADRI DI BICILIETTE is so powerful in terms of visual impact that it demands the viewer's attention. It is quite deservedly one of the established classics of world cinema.",

The actors in this film are all remarkable, especially the two playing the leads. Lamberto Maggiorani as Antonio Ricci and Enzo Staiola as his son are both haunting in their roles, conveying in their roles far more emotion than many A-list Hollywood stars.The story goes that Antonio is a family man living in post-war Rome. Work is hard to get so you can guess his excitement when he lands a job as a poster of advertisements. Unluckily for him the job absolutely requires a bicycle and his gets stolen on his first day. Thus begins a frantic search throughout the streets and markets of Rome, helped by friends and his son.And as much as I have to praise the acting and emotion in this film, I do have to admit that the majority of the film is rather boring. The initial setup is interesting enough, but the search itself goes on way too long and consists mainly of the father and son aimlessly wandering around, searching for clues.So why is this such a classic? I mean, I guess it's an interesting look into post-war Italy, but there are many a film about that precise subject. And it is a tedious experience to sit through. But all that wandering, all that prolonged misery is necessary because of one thing. The ending. This film has one of the most poignant, most powerful endings I've ever seen. In it culminate the themes and hardships of the film in a way that's rarely seen.This is a hard film to recommend. It has power and depth, but it's also told in a way that's hard to sit through.

This film is about something in society that we all, no matter what country you live in, take for granted. We never question the routine stability of conveniences and services in life provided by the lower class jobs. When we hear of thefts in certain parts of town, we're never as careful as we should be, and we, especially those of us who are younger, don't tend to think about the true effects the crime of stealing can cause. To us, crime can even sound like fun, and so can criminals. This film is about a poor man who sells his bedsheets as a last resort to afford the bicycle he needs as a requirement for his new job. On his first day, a thief steals his bicycle, and if he doesn't get it back, he will be fired. He has an innocent, sensitive young son to take care of. He has a wife who worries constantly.The movie is not just realistic, and made to show us reality. It's about a certain part of reality that society disguises in gloss. We never think about the posters we see or the food that is served or the garbage taken out. Thieves are glamorized, and surely even after experiencing this story we'll go right back to secretly enjoying hearing it when a brilliant bank heist is in the news and the crooks got away clean and other equivalents. But the important thing that I feel I got out of this movie is that no matter where society runs to remain blissfully forgetful of the horror of reality---and for the characters here, it truly is horror, and director Vittorio De Sica is sure to make us feel it with them---it will always be there, and it will always happen to somebody.",

Once a no-have, always a no-have. The bike is but a myth, says the movie: the middle class is but a myth.And the story goes beyond its social level: it's the personal drama of a no-have guy against a universe of no-haves (like him) completely indifferent to his drama. Nobody's innocent in this story, while nobody's guilty: everyone fights to make ends meet, everyone is indifferent to the large picture.And above all these, it is the eye of Vittorio de Sica, his extraordinary empathy for this universe of no-haves (a lesson learned from the movies of Chaplin). A universe of a superb picaresque quality: so real, so everyday, while every now and then exploding in surreal!And Enzo Staiola, the kid always standing by his father, against all odds.

(Or both). Looking at the film this way has the ending lands with a guy punch. In each life our father figure disappoints us and growing up is encountering such a moment. I'm not sure how common this view is but it is what wrecked my heart.I don't have much to add to the consensus here; it is a beautiful film and it is considered among the best made for a reason.",

            "content": "The drama Bicycle Thieves is directed by Vittorio De Sica and stars Lamberto Maggiorani and Enzo Staiola. The film takes place in modern day Rome , and modern day is in the 40s because that was when the film was made.The film starts off with a man yelling the name Ricci (Maggiorani) who is a person that gives out jobs. Ricci goes to the man and finds out that he is getting a job that pays very well but he needs a bicycle. His bicycle is getting repaired and it is not supposed to be done for a week and he needs it for the next morning. Ricci goes to the repair shot and pays extra to get his bicycle. His wife and son are very happy for him and he is extremely excited to go to his first day of work because he was so unlucky in the past. Unfortunately at his first day of work while gluing posters to the wall someone steals his bicycle. And that is when the chase to get his bicycle back begins...The screenplay for this film received an Oscar nomination which it well deserved, and it probably deserved to win as well even though I have not yet seen the film that did win. The writing was so simple, so pure and that is what I loved about it. It was easy to watch yet extremely thought provoking. The film is truly amazing because the plot is so basic but it is just so powerful. I don't wish to spoil anything but the ending is absolutely brilliant as well. The screenplay for this film is a masterpiece and I wish more of them today were like this.The direction for this film also was quite simple, which made it quite brilliant. There are only few films that get me so emotionally attached to their main characters. De Sica does not use complex shots really at all in this film yet I still think it is one of the best directed films ever made. It is hard to describe, the only word I can really think of is pure. De Sica did not direct this film to make money or to win awards, he just directed it because it was what he was born to do.The acting for this film was as well superb. Maggiorani plays Ricci and he is fantastic. He is just a simple man who wants his bicycle back so he can get money to support his family. He is the everyman and Maggiorani played the role perfectly. Enzo Staiola was Ricci's son and he was just the normal kid and he also did his role perfectly. It was like the two of them weren't acting at all they were just that real father and son. The supporting cast as well did a spectacular job.Overall I give this film a 10/10 and I'm proud to call it my new second favorite film. It is perfect in every way and I recommend this film to absolutely everyone. If you don't enjoy then I must say that you don't see the beauty in simplicity.",

            "content": "(1948) Ladri di biciclette. Director Antoni de Sica made many very commercial movies in Italy in the 1930s & 40s. The Bicycle Thief is considered a landmark film for its realistic portrayal of hard times in Italy. Now the technique is called Italian Neo-Realism. I made a random movie pick yesterday to watch this director's other famous movie Umberto D. That film impressed me so much I decided to immediately follow it with his earlier work. Antonio Ricci, unemployed for over two years, is overjoyed when he's finally given a job putting up posters. There's a catch, though - he needs a bicycle as a requirement of the job, so he pawns the family linen to get a pawned bicycle back. He goes off to his first day's work, truly happy for the first time in years - & the title of the film gives away what happens next. Even though the film is about the fathers job & stolen bicycle the movie follows the young 5 year old son & the boys reaction to all the things that happen that Sunday afternoon when he & his father go about Rome trying to find the fathers stolen bicycle. Lately there have been some reviews panning this movie calling it emotionally manipulative. That is true & that aspect & the neo realism make this film a particularly interesting one since it was made pre 1950. For me a poignant tearjerker might be a better description. The man with the stolen bike loves his family & wants to protect & support them. Post Wartime in Italian society makes that difficult. Even today 2010 we call can identify economic problems. You can read a lot about de Sici on wikipedia & the start & end of Italian neo-realism. The film won an honorary Oscar in 1949 & has won praise for years & I continue to give it praise\u2014it is a very fine movie. When it was released, it was seen as a Marxist fable (Zavattini the writer) was a member of the Italian communist party). Be sure & view the extras on this DVD they provide more info about the writing & plot process. 5 Stars Great Movie!!",

I remember that it was an important film and one that I knew I needed to revisit now that I'm more seasoned. Jaime and I watched this as it was part of the Internet Movie Database Top 100 films poster.We have a basic story here. Life is hard in this area as we are in Italy, post-World War II. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is given a job but needs a bicycle. His wife is Maria (Lianella Carell) does what she can to help. They pawn their sheets/blankets so they can get his bike out of pawn. Things are looking up for this family.That is until Antonio's bicycle is stolen while he's working. He gives chase, but this is a coordinated effort with people helping the thief escape. This forces Antonio to reach out to a guy who I assume is connected. They round up a group the next day to try to find the stolen bike. This includes Antonio's son of Bruno (Enzo Staiola) joining them.Now what is interesting here is that Jaime resisted watching this. Part of it is that this is foreign. She isn't the biggest fan of needing to read subtitles. Going even further than that, this is from 1948. She was surprisingly engaged though. I believe it is because it is a story that anyone can connect with. We've all tried to better ourselves with a job and we all have had something stolen from us. What makes this difficult is the fact that their lives are on the line as after the war, there is a state of depression economically.What makes this work as well is how personable Antonio, Bruno and Maria are. I felt for them. I want to help them in anyway I can. I've been low like they have, just not the extent. The big concern here is not knowing where their next meal will come from. That is tough to deal with, but even worse when there's a child involved. This movie is bleak. I will say that. I didn't remember how depressing it is. It is powerful in what it does there for sure.It helps that this is well-made. We get good cinematography to get a feel of where they are living. You feel the effects of the war. You see how impoverished the area is. This being in black and white also adds to it. We are seeing a couple days in the lives of these people and it is done in a way where I also connected with them as well. Not a movie that I can recommend to everyone. If you're a cinephile, then definitely watch this as it is an important aspect of the history of cinema.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "While infusing a beautiful depiction of post-war Italy with the bitter tale of a man struggling to survive, Ladri Di Biciclette is a perfect example of neo-realist film. This film takes place at numerous locations around Rome, Italy. A church, a restaurant, a busy street, an apartment complex, and a warehouse are all depicted. The picture shows many artistic shots of the landscape such as when all the bicyclists ride through the streets, past parks, and around monuments of Rome as Antonio reports for his first day of work. Shots of glistening bicycle parts on a sales table, or a trolley slowing down on an empty street to drop off passengers have been inserted to artistically enhance the film. This reflection of traditional Italy can be contrasted to the fast paced modern look in French New Wave films such as 'Breathless,' directed by Jean-Luc Goddard, yet both achieve the documentary feel associated with their respective film movements. De Sica's film clearly advocates a realistic depiction of life including its less pleasant aspects. It explores the human condition and questions society, family, law enforcement, alliances, and mental anguish impeccably. The audience experiences the erosion of Antonio's pride. He is exceedingly proud of his new job and his new bike and takes great care to inspect every smooth edge of metal on his bike when he first receives it. This serves as the antithesis to the conclusion of the story, where he is caught trying to steal a bike. Though his intentions are merely to support his family he is ultimately stricken with shame and feels the lowest blow when his son, Bruno becomes aware that his own father has stooped to such a low level. The men who catch Antonio acknowledge that his broken and ashamed state is an even worse punishment than being arrested. The film closes here in true neo-realist style, leaving the hero void of all pride. The film also exemplifies the ineffectiveness of institutions in post-war Italy. \"There's just no work for you!\" states the man in the opening scene of the movie as a crowd of desperate men stand around in hopes of gaining employment. As the film shows a glimpse into this period of Italy's history, it also explores the uselessness of the police force and the social disarray of the era. Though subjective, told through De Sica's perspective, the police force is treated with derision. The premise of the protagonist's bike being taken is an example of the structural problems facing Italy. At the market it is believed that many of the bike parts are stolen, and it is impossible for Antonio and Bruno to locate parts from Antonio's bicycle. In a scene later on, Antonio confronts the \"kid in the German hat\" who is believed to have taken the bicycle, but is immediately shut up, verbally and physically, by a mob of neighborhood cronies. In this 'kangaroo court' the mob insists Antonio is crazy for accusing the boy. When the police do arrive to this scene, they are once again ineffective in restoring order as the cronies continue to shove the antagonist. One viciously yells, \"Want to lose your wallet too?\" This portrayal of the harsh and brutal nature of society is a seemingly accurate depiction of Italian history, and a clear presentation of the social ills. Its pessimistic view of the human condition is effectively disheartening, and at the same time a perfect example of Italian Neo-Realism.",

We can feel good for Antonio only for a moment, until his bicycle is gone, and then when him and his son have to find it I felt nothing but pity. It's a real telling story for the simple fact that we know what it's like for a good parent to want to do good in their kids' eyes, especially a father because he's a man, and many men have a strong sense of pride. It's a strongly sentimental movie and it brings us the intense feelings of bad luck, failure and desperation. We can't help but wonder if Antonio will come out of this depression that Italy, and many other parts of the world, faced during this time.",

Antonito Ricci and his family are one of the many effected by this. Ricci finally lands a job hanging up posters but the only way he can have the job is if he has a bicycle. No bike no job. His wife sells some bed sheets to get his bicycle out of a pawn shop. Almost right away a man steals his bicycle while he is hanging a poster. Ricci chases after him but the thief is to fast and Ricci loses him. He tries to tell the police, they care but cant waste time on such a small crime, all they can do is get the bike if he finds it in a pawn shop. He begins a desperate search for his bike, and really his whole life. he knows that if he cannot find it he and his family will starve. The Bicycle Thief is beautiful in many ways. Directing, cinematography, acting, writing, everything is almost perfect. Its deep and meaningful and thought provoking. There is so much hope and depression together in one film. The bicycle is more than just a bike to Antonito, its his life. Without the bike he can't work, he can't eat, or provide for his family at all, without it he can't live.****Spoilers****With how depressing the film is you can't help but think it's going to have a happy ending. While it is depressing there's that sense of hope that makes he think he will find the bike at the end. Near the end when you see Antonito on the corner with his son and he's looking at the bikes you slowly see the desperation kicking in deep. In which I think is the best 30 seconds (give or take) in the film. The directing and acting in this scene is amazing. Watching him you can feel his desperation getting deeper and deeper, while he paces and looks back and forth between the single bike and the group of bikes. When he steals the lone bike and makes a run for it everyone chases him down, which unfortunately didn't happen when his bike was stolen. Dozens of men catch him and hold him until the bike owner comes over. Antonito's son runs to him crying, the man sees he's not just some criminal and says to let him go because he has enough problems. All the other men start yelling at Antonito saying he should thank God that he's not going to jail because that's where he belongs, and maybe he would prefer that. As he walks away him and his son are destroyed, crying and holding hands. Antonito grips his sons hand tighter, he knows his life is over\u0085 and the film ends.Its possibly one of the most depressing films I've ever seen, up there with Requiem for a Dream.****end spoilers****Its so powerful. Anyone who appreciates good old films shouldn't miss this one. I know many people (especially younger ones) are against watching black and white or even foreign films, and if you skip watching this because of either of these reasons you are a fool.",

            "content": "The other commentators say that the protagonist, Antonio Ricci, is a poor man for whom we feel sympathy. This is not what the movie-makers had in mind. This is a Marxist allegory and Antonio is as much the bad guy of the movie as the hero.When the movie opens, Antonio sits apart from the other unemployed workers because he thinks of himself as in a class better than the others. (He is the only worker in the movie who wears a fedora rather than some kind of worker's cap.) He will pay for this arrogance later. Antonio was a member of the petty bourgeoisie, with sheets on his bed and a bicycle. A financial crisis forced him to pawn one of them, so he pawned the bicycle.\nThe government employment agent gives him a job that requires a bicycle, even though Antonio admits he no longer has a working bicycle and there are other workers in the crowd who do. This symbolizes the government's favoritism of the bourgeoisie over the working poor. Antonio and his wife sell the sheets to redeem the bicycle, so he can take the job. The bicycle represents the means of production. A thief, wearing an old German hat, steals the bicycle. He represents the international proletariat. In stealing the means of production he is carrying out a miniature Marxist revolution.\nThroughout the film we meet people who show solidarity with the working class and proper Marxist conciousness. E.g., the old man who won't \"rat\" on the thief and who attends a church service only so he can get a free meal. The neighbors of the thief who are prepared to perjure themselves in his defense. The crowd that gathers in sympathy when a boy falls into a river. By contrast, Antonio is concerned only when he thinks the boy might be his son. When he discovers that it is not his son, he forgets the real endangered boy and takes his son off looking for a pizza parlor.\nMarx thought that the proletariat would inevitably triumph. In the context of this movie, that would mean that Antonio doesn't get the bicycle back in the end. You'll have to see the movie to find out if the movie-makers agreed with Marx about that.",

But searching for the bike becomes like searching a needle in hay. As he is seeking in the neighbourhood more and more eagerly we see how his worrying is sucking him out; soon, he is so out of his mind that he - otherwise a caring father - is no more able to recognize the distress of his own child, the victim of anger which has been acumulating in his father for five years.\nWrongful behaviour requires redemption, but not in money, which the father does, as he invites his son to a pub like some kind of a companion in order to share with him his confused dreams. \"If it was so and so...\" he is telling him.\nSince I don't want to reveal too much of the story I will conclude by indicating the underlying theme as I perceived it: we cannot find justice outside ourselves. Here, it came into the light from a man who has already gained enough spiritual wealth.

            "content": "Bicycle Thieves is directed by Vittorio De Sica. It's also the 2,000th film I've logged on this site, and I can't of a better film to mark this milestone. Bicycle Thieves is a wonderful piece of neo-realism. It's a film that has influenced countless film-makers from Ken Loach to Isao Takahata. Set during the aftermath of post war Italy, it tells the story of a poor working class father that just wants a job so he can support his family. When Antonio is offered a job posting advertising bills, he gladly accepts. The only problem is the job requires a bicycle, which he had previously pawned to keep his family afloat.Without his bicycle he still accepts the job, Antonio and his wife decide to sell all their bed linens towards re-buying his bicycle for his new job. On his first day of work, he gets distracted and a thief steals his bicycle. After getting no help from the Police, Antonio and his young son Bruno set about finding his bicycle before it's gone forever.Bicycle Thieves is a film that is still as relevant today as it was back in 1948. It shows the struggles of the working class post war. It's heartbreaking to watch as Antonio slowly starts to break down and become increasingly more desperate to find his bicycle, just so he can keep hold of his job. The film is a universal story about a working class man that simply wants a job to better his families lives, and despite all his best efforts his desperation turns him towards corruption.The film is held up wonderfully by the two main performances from the father Antonio(Lamberto Maggiorani) who gives a heart-wrenching performance as man close to breaking down, and his son Bruno(Enzo Staiola) who gives a stand-out performance. Enzo Staiola gives one of the best child performances I've seen. His reactions and facial expressions sell the struggles he and his father face, especially when his fathers desperation get him into trouble.Bicycle Thieves is also beautifully shot, again it's another film I've had the pleasure to watch courtesy of Arrow Video's wonderful Blu-ray restoration. Bicycle Thieves is a film that is worthy of all of it's acclaim, and is the definition of a true classic.",

The difficulties and despair faced by a father and son in searching for a stolen bicycle are a profound embodiment of the challenges faced by so many others in a time of great poverty.An incredibly expressive lead performance by Lamberto Maggiorani, a non-professional actor, lends a voice to the hope and frustration of a generation. His joyous countenance on the morning of his first day at work makes the desperate and disheartening search for the bicycle all the more moving and conveys the tragedy of small hopes being crushed by everyday adversities and misdemeanours.The search through the city of Rome brings the viewer into contact with great crowds of people, from a busy marketplace to a church service and onwards to a football game. As well as portraying masses of people the film shows the sad and often ramshackle streets in great detail; in some scenes the mere panning of the camera through these streets captures the desolation of post-war Italy.The haunting score by composer Alessandro Cicognini lends itself superbly to both the story and the imagery and completes an utterly enthralling film, fully deserving of its status as a classic.",

The movie brings the audience into some sense of hope by following Antonio's journey with Bruno through all the bitterness of search. Yet I feel that the movie gives a very good slap to the audience with it's complete sad ending. It's like the movie's saying harshly that we don't always get what we want, even if we're down on the ground.

The action of the movie is slow, sparse and predictable, and the characters have little depth; they are mostly automata enacting conventionally established roles. The film stays rigidly within the framework and conventions set for it by the genre, or perhaps imposed on it _ad_hoc_ by the director. It is pictorially pleasurable, but as it is \"neorealism\" perhaps we are not supposed to enjoy the view but suffer from it. (Actually, from the point of view of Americans of 2005, there is nothing realistic whatever about it; we could be looking at people living on the moon.) Its closest relatives would be from the genre of Socialist Realism, but in the USSR the protagonist, instead of suffering a moral catastrophe at the end, would probably have to get religion with the Party. Of course such conventions are fundamentally no more \"real\" than the weirdnesses of Antonioni or Fellini -- who also knew how to make the sufferings of the poor entertaining, although they didn't focus on them with such rapt attention.Many people say this film had great influence on those which came after it, which may explain why I feel that it is not tremendously interesting and certainly not up to the adulation which has been heaped on it.

            "content": "This is a powerful cornerstone of Italian neo-realism. World War 2 had left the country ravaged and in political strife and this movement took advantage. De Sica's choices are evident: the two leads are well known to be non- professionals (and neither exactly hit stardom afterwards), meaning every authentic tic is magnified. The camera seldom moves save for a few pans and slow zoom ins; De Sica's preference is objectiveness and displaying the story as it is. The editing is un-obtrusive. Deep focus is applied to every shot so that the hordes of extras mingle around in post-war Rome, each with their own individual tale. He shoots on location, and for some of the figures in the background this is a day-to-day affair, perhaps with a little treat now and again, maybe a football game on the weekend, or lunch at the pizzeria. At times De Sica even captures the mundane; boys playing in the streets, actors rehearsing on stage, church-goers reading hymns, an ugly man seeking romantic blessings. There is focus on one man, Antonio Ricci and his poverty stricken family. He has waited two long years for this job, and is not about to lose it now. Maggiorani displays every inch of despair at losing his bicycle. See how his face falls upon seeing a family feasting on a great meal. See how hesitant and ashamed he is, not willing to divulge the news to his son nor his wife. At the start of the day, he drops off Bruno, not to school, but to a little gas station where he labours all day as a pump assistant. Even his little boy has employment! How shattered his dignity is, and therefore how imperative it is that the bicycle is recovered. His wife Maria tries her own methods; she has been visiting the local seer who has prophesied many things. It is easy to sit within wealth and laugh at the foolishness and naivety of her predictions and those who believe them. Here, it is not foolishness, but desperation. What is often not mentioned is that Antonio himself is not the most sympathetic of characters. Oh, it's a heartbreaking predicament that he is in, there is no doubt about that, and that drives his desperate quest. But where are we introduced to him? There is an eager crowd waiting for a job, and the camera tracks his friend as he runs and runs and runs to tell him the great news, where he is sitting absent-mindedly as though he has not a care in the world. It is Maria who makes the sacrifice of her wedding linens, and of course that eventuates in that iconic shot of piles and piles of similarly pawned stacks of cloth. Antonio becomes so focused on catching the thief that he begins to be careless, and in a fit of guilt, he nearly convinces himself that he has let his son drown. He invades people's homes without thought. And then there is that red herring initially, where he leaves his bike unattended and we sit watching, biting our fingernails and hands gripped together as he exits, and there it is. It is De Sica's triumph that these faults exist, and in spite of them we despair for Antonio. The English translation has the title of The Bicycle Thief, becomes of course it is a story of how a thief commits a small act of wrong and how impossibly large and devastating the consequences are. The original Italian title however is much more appropriate: this is not a film about a singular thief, but about a man who becomes one in his own right. It remains impossible to judge Antonio's decision if we have not been through the same situation he has. And in the same vein, perhaps the original thief was similarly in strife. The last scene is haunting, as the pair of father and son grasps hands lightly, a bond of respect and care severed, and are swallowed by the crowd. How many other bicycle thieves are in that shot?",

I feel sorry for the main character in a generic kind of way, but that is all. The few details we have about him and his family are kind of arbitrary and vague, so I never felt as if I had gotten to know him as a person. In short, this is a serious film about a difficult time and the desperation of the people who lived through it, but it was neither as informative about that time as a documentary would have been nor as engaging as a dramatic vehicle should have been.",

Funniest thing is that he did not appear ill at all, when he sized up Antonio's unsecured bicycle and decided to steal it. The bad part is that Antonio is so honest, but later in the film, of course, he decides to steal a bicycle himself. I feel that he is a very moral man who deserves a break financially. Surely the wealthier family at the table in the restaurant can afford quite a few bicycles, not to mention their ownership of motor vehicles and the requisite chauffeur cordon. What was this ritzy family doing in a restaurant where Antonio and Bruno would eat? (This reminds me of Downton Abbey and all the pretentiousness of the wealthy upperclass snobs, who were post-World War One about to lose their sources of income). The snottiness of the wealthy son toward little Bruno was uncalled for. Perhaps the rich family was getting rich off the misfortunes of the poorer people. Perhaps they owned a string of pawn shops where all the luckless young mothers were forever hocking their dear, precious dowry bedsheets. 10/10",

            "review_title": "Italian Neorealism at its Most Sympathetic",
            "content": "In the mid 1940s, Italian cinema had taken a huge directional upheaval with the neorealism movement, in which films would tell contemporary narratives through the poor working class. Arguably one of the most critically acclaimed of these features would have to be Vittorio De Sica's 1948 drama Bicycle Thieves. Released with massive appraisal and later an honorary Academy Award, this film has often been sighted as one of the most influential cinematic endeavors of all time, and to this day has often been regarded as highly inspirational to modern day filmmakers. As bleak as this feature is, it makes all the more sense why.Set in post-World War II Rome, the movie follows the story of Antonio Ricci, a poor father desperately searching for his stolen bicycle, without which he will lose the job he gained to save his young family. Quite like many narratives that would go as such, the film is established with the horribly grim Italy had faced at the time, from a severe poverty problem to the uncertainty of whether Antonio and his housewife Maria can provide much for their already small family. However, once Antonio's bike is stolen, the plot immediately picks up and becomes a more realistic approach to the mystery of the stolen what have you trope. Based on Antonio's horrible desperation to retrieve what was wrongfully stolen from him, the cruelty of modern life threatens to bring his primal instincts to anyone related to the thief, albeit to the resentment of other people of different classes and backgrounds. On top of his own son Bruno tagging along, the mystery of the stolen bike becomes a greater ordeal to his family and the classism status of Italy itself. It's grueling tales like these that make robbers of us all.In the words of critic A. O. Scott, Bicycle Thieves is about \"the danger of being distracted from what matters.\" Even outside of its historical context, the underlying themes of injustice and a lack of empathy towards the lower class hold up just as much today, reflecting both the Ricci's struggles and the mistreatment from con artists and close minded authorities. Throughout Antonio's horrendous journey of endlessly searching for his stolen bike, we can see his dignity get stripped away as he grows more and more impatient to the people around him, expertly delivered by former factory worker Lamberto Maggiorani. The irony there actually proves this film's thesis since Maggiorani was actually laid off from his factory job after the film was released due to them perceiving him to be a movie star. Adding on to the Ricci's struggle for survival, the manipulation and trickery they endure from everyone around them leads to one of the most heartbreaking endings in cinema history. By completely going against the established Hollywood schmaltz, this type of film wraps up the best way it possibly could.However, outside of the grim tone shown throughout, there is also a fairly upbeat poetic self-consciousness sprinkled at times. Some of the funniest and most heartwarming scenes come courtesy of Bruno himself, as one can see him and his father growing together more and more through their hard times. As memorably shattering as Alessandro Cicoginini's score is, whenever a scene calls for some levity, the music can add a nicely authentic flavor of Italian culture. One notable scene of Antonio and Bruno in a restaurant provides just as many laughs as it does a poignant contrast from one class to another. It also helps that Antonio's first order of work is hanging up a poster of Rita Hayworth, showcasing how the Italian economic boom would soon reflect the Hollywood landscape. It's really fascinating how all the disappointment Antonio and Bruno endure is also interlined with the pursuit of pleasure. There are glimmers of beauty and delight even during the worst possible circumstances, something that feels lost in features that are too depressing for their own good.As a tale of survival shown through desperation in the working class, Bicycle Thieves rightfully earns its place amongst one of the most heartbreaking features worth watching for its subject matter alone. Regardless of the time it was made being an important factor, anyone can check this film out for its captivating story and escapades of comedy and beauty mixed with tragedy and despair. The fact that this film has been imitated, parodied, and analyzed for decades onward, its no wonder why nearly 75 years since its release, it lives on as a fable that is primarily about seeing and caring.",

Times are hard, work is scarce. Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) gets a job putting up posters. He'll need a bike, but he doesn't have one... well, he does, but he pawned it to buy food. Swapping bed sheets for the bike, he gets it back. These seem like minor details, but details matter, craft matters and this is a wonderfully rich story. The bike is important, a lifeline in a harsh existence. You can see what's going to happen and the tease, the tension, it's excruciating. Antonio is such a nice person, as is his wife Maria, their baby daughter and especially young Bruno (Enzo Staiola) who's already a chip off the old block. All this plays to the pure desperation to Antonio having his bike stolen. It's just a bike, but it's so much more. I often think films like this wouldn't work if made now, we expect too much energy and drive in modern cinema. This subtlety would be lost. I'm not so sure through, I'd love to see someone make something like this. Simple clean dialogue, elegant cinematography, honest and romantic characters. Losing his bike you'd think would scupper the story, but it's merely the beginning. Antonio is a hard worker and with a network of like minded souls behind him, he sets to scouring Rome for his beloved wheels. The back streets of Rome look beautiful, especially in soft monochrome and there's a real sense of the place, the stone, the people. The story though sounds like it could be dull, but again it's the details that matter. The story burns with purpose, the feisty Italian passion driving it along. Antonio and Bruno turn amateur sleuths, following a lead, but one that brings more frustration and dangerous temptation. It's absolutely beautiful!",

Left to the social norms that run over the last shred of human dignity. It's sad and heartbreaking.The director brings a realistic and tragic story of loneliness and isolation of the common man in a complex social system. Ironic but true. The system destructible man. The streets of Rome are full of life. The disorder in the form of poverty and misery is a real inner picture. Paradoxically or not, this is the story of a healthy man and his struggle for survival through limited possibilities of civilization.In life, the most important are the little things. In this film, it is a tool for work. The loss of this funding brings the main protagonist to despair. The film is the second part turns into aimless running around Rome in search of \"the means of life\". In some moments of hope appears as an antidote to despair. However aimless wandering will drive away all hope. It's amazing sounds, but each person in the film and the occurrence of certain protagonists directly affects the atmosphere. Ironically the man violates social norms in pursuit of a stolen bicycle. Despair does not choose neither the time nor the place.This film can be viewed as a collection of experiences through human anxiety. Tragicomic everyday. How the system takes time to break a man, kills the human spirit in him, and gave it to fate. Non-professional actors express subtlety, strength and sensitivity of the common man or only child.The film, which is artfully \"packed\" should at all fill the heart with warmth and compassion.

            "content": "There's no movie I've seen ever that is as honest in its emotions as Bicycle Thieves. Its visual storytelling is ahead of its time. It may seem a bit clich\u00e9, but this movie is the finest example of \"says so much by saying so little\". Carlo Montuori's cinematography couldn't have been more expressive, and Lamberto Maggiorani couldn't have embodied his character better. Not to mention the sweet relationship between Antonio Ricci and his son, Bruno, that brought us some of the most heartbreaking and poignant moments in film, while granting other humorous moments that will put smile on your face involuntarily. Thanks in large part to Enzo Staiola's likable performance. A performance that reminded me of Giorgio Cantarini's performance in La Vita \u00e8 Bella, another Italian film that is influenced by Bicycle Thieves in terms of the father/son relationship.Truth be told, Vittorio De Sica's intimate direction is what took this movie to a higher level. A direction that took advantage of the simplicity of the story in the best possible way. You can't help putting yourself in the protagonist's shoes, and rooting for him, and his cute son, like you haven't done before. It's a direction that made the naivety of the situations you see the characters get through seem so genuine and authentic that you feel you've been a member of this poor and simple society all through your life.Cesare Zavattini's Oscar nominated screenplay should be praised for balancing between the progress of the main plot adding many layers to it, and making it feel more complicated, while fleshing out the characters with no much dialogue. That being said, it's the movie's script that is flawed. there is timing inaccuracy, and plot holes that can be a tad bit infuriating.The music by Alessandro Cicognini played a key role in keeping the tragic tone underneath most of the movie to use it later while reflecting the protagonist's misery.Overall, Ladri Di Biciclette is an honest, simple, and unpretentious portrait of the struggle for life and self-esteem that deserves every bit of recognition it gets.

I'll have to watch it again.The part of the movie that works for me is the reaction of the son, Bruno, to problems his father is having.  He wants to be proud of his father, but things only go from bad to worse.A guy with no bicycle gets a job that requires a bicycle.  He relies on his wife to solve the problem by pawning their new and used sheets to get their old bicycle out of hock.  Why would a pawn shop value a bicycle the same as used bedding especially when they already have a warehouse full of pawned bedding?The job entails carrying a big ladder, a bucket of paste, a big paste brush, and movie posters on a bicycle and putting up posters. That would seem to be a dangerous and stupid balancing act.  Why aren't the people and supplies delivered by truck?The bicycle gets stolen from under his nose at the first job and he is unable to catch the thief even when he is \"aided\" by someone in a truck. Why didn't he put some kind of restraint on the bike?  Why didn't the thief choose an unattended bike?  It is hard to believe he could not catch the bike thief.He tries to find the stolen bike and then gives up.  Why couldn't he borrow someone's bike or even promise to pay someone part of his new big salary to use their bike?Spoilers: As a last resort, he grabs an unattended bike, but as soon as he touches it, ten people appear out of every door and window and chase him down and catch him.  It is incredible that out of all the bicycles in Italy this guy chooses the one that is guarded by ten athletes that are able to outrun a bicycle that has a big head start. You have to wonder if this guy is too dumb to function in that society.  He takes a ridiculous job, depends on his wife to get a bike, is unable to hold on to the bike, unable to catch the thief, unable to find his stolen bike, unable to come up with a plan to get a new bike except for theft which he bungles.  When you see him putting up a poster, he seems very sloppy and the results do not look good.   So even if he had a bike, he would probably be fired for sloppy work.If you a looking for a real masterpiece of Italian cinema, look at Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, a movie that is much better.",

            "content": "Firstly, a word of warning: Once again, as it's obviously what I do best, I will play the devil's advocate and lambast another great movie. The reason I feel I can do this is that it's already praised so highly by just about everyone else one this site and elsewhere, so that more positive reviews would be pretty much redundant. Yes, I know I'll probably burn in the pits of cinema's hell for this, if there is one. Or, I'll be sentenced to spend eternity watching endless reruns of Mel Gibson movies. When it's all said and done, though, I'll try to make some amends by rating it... well, maybe not a 10 this time, but at least an 8. So please, try to forgive me.Well, to the point, and it's actually a brief one. There will be no attempts of armchair philosophy this time. The reason why I could not stomach this movie is a simple one: it's a movie for kids. Make sure you take your children along to see it, or if you don't have any, bring along some of the juvenile punks in your neighborhood. They will probably enjoy it more than you, even if it's for all the wrong reasons. By this I mean something more than the obvious fact the the plot and the ideas of the movie are simple and dumbed down enough for a four-year old to understand. From beginning to end, \"Ladri di biciclette\" is marked by a profound infantilism, and a bad sort. It's not the wonderful and honest infantilism of, say, Fellini, where you'll find a real and often very painful account of the reality of being a child, as well as showing the child that still is inside us when we're long since grown up (especially the experience of being an Italian male child with all the traumas of dealing with authority, with the church, with the mothers and fathers of that place and time). That kind of child is shown as a true human being, not least (and we can of course thank psychoanalysis for this, in Fellinis case mostly the theories of Carl Jung) with a true will to power and an extremely powerful sexuality. It's a childhood that is no longer innocent.The childhood of \"Ladri de biciclette\" is more of the Disney variety. For all its highly praised \"social realism\", the movie doesn't have much psychological realism, and the social critique actually suffers profoundly as a result. This is because its social \"theories\", if that's not too strong a word, are based on an idea of \"a fall from paradise\", the paradise of childhood or childishness. As I said, Fellini's children, like the children of Freud or Jung, are no longer thought of as innocent. The very notion of innocence itself is revealed as a myth. De Sica, however, seems to think of childhood as something profoundly innocent and pure, \"uncontaminated\" by those \"evil\" social forces that corrupt people and turn them into egoists, make them violent - and make them bicycle thieves. This state of childhood extends into adulthood as well, until it's \"ruined\" by society. When I say it's a movie for kids, I should add that it's mostly a movie for little boys - \"good\" little boys. The protagonist Antonio is nothing more than a big kid, just as childlike as his son Bruno. The other male \"good guys\" are either kind and friendly uncles, or also, again, children themselves. The one, at least partly, adult character in the movie is, of course, the mother, Maria. Good grief, of course she could not have been known by any other name. She is a virgin mother if ever there was one, asexual or perhaps pre-sexual, profoundly kind and caring, the kind of mother any good little boy could want - or the kind of mother-substitute any good infantile Italian husband could want for a wife. Even so, even she does not escape being treated as a little girl for a good part of the story.Sexuality is more or less completely censored from the film. Even in the scene in the bordello, where the focalization changes to the kid Bruno - and he can, of course, not come in. The camera, and we along with it, is left waiting on the outside.I had not seen much, if any, mention of this profoundly infantile stance in articles and reviews of the movie, and it honestly caught me by surprise. Still, it's the impression that stays with me. This is a tale of the corrupting forces of society, that ruins our original purity, and if not for those forces, we would still all be little boys and girls, playing our games, lacking nothing and never having to grow up. Well... it simple beyond belief, and just doesn't ring all that realistic to me.The fact that the whole thing was rehashed in the dreadful \"La Vita \u00e8 bella\" by Benigni (bicycle and all), is another sad chapter, but I won't get into that, as that, at least, it's obviously not De Sica's fault directly.",

I had read about this movie in various magazines, books and film review. The most I remember it about was while reading the autobiography of Satyajit Ray. He mentioned the movie and how it inspired him to plunge into making movies. The more I read about Bicycle thieves the more I was eager to see it.I got the occasion during our first Development Team meeting. Our team's boss \u0096 Mr.Bernhard Drumel \u0096 who is a German \u0096 I understood has keen interests in movies. He had organized the first development team meeting in a small restaurant \u0096 called Vertigo \u0096 below a theatre \"Film Museum\". The theatre was in a wonderful location, in the midst of the biggest park of Amsterdam \u0096 Vondelpark. One has to walk from a tram stop and walk all through the way inside the park, the wooden bridge, small water pond and lovely line of trees. During this first official meeting Bernhard and my official Guru \u0096 Mr.Andreas Hensel showed interest in seeing this movie after the meeting at 5:30 pm. I immediately jumped to opportunity. Even if they (or anyone else) had not seen the movie, I would had gone for the same.Bicycle Thieves is an Italian movie, made in 1945. It is called Neo-realism movie. The movie is about an unemployed man who gets a job \u0096 but for that he has to have a bicycle. He requests his wife to sell some of the linens and buy an old bicycle. But during his work the bicycle gets stolen. The whole movie is about how his son and he are trying to search the bicycle. There are moments of happiness, joy and sadness \u0096 very poignant! The father traces the thieve, but seeing his poverty and not finding the bike \u0096 comes back and thinks of stealing a bicycle themselves; and while doing so \u0096 he gets caught. Seeing his poor state \u0096 people do not take him into prison \u0096 but leave him on the roads again. The last scene was the expression of humiliation of father seen caught in front of his son \u0096 the movie ends there \u0096 sadly.The best portion that I liked of the movie was that \u0096 the story line was very simple. But the direction was fantastic. Throughout the movie, on the backdrop, there are things happening \u0096 that showcase the Italian economy, society and culture. As a director \u0096 it takes lots of efforts to manage and the huge movie canvas \u0096 through these minute details of back-drop.",

I'm not on about when the bike was first stolen but when by pure chance after the rain he sees the culprit not too far off, he could have bee a bit more subtle and wiser in his approach. But apart from that brilliant, I am very sure things turned out for the best since he did not lose the most important thing that is his family, his son who remained ever loving by his side. One notes that he was a bit careless in keeping an eye on his bike, we could see early opportunities for the thieves to snatch it before it was actually stolen and same could have happened to his son all throughout but thank god that never did. I am very glad I finally got to watch this all time classic.",

            "review_title": "Haven't been able to stop thinking about this movie since my college film class",
            "content": "I share the sentiments of many other reviewers here. I find so much beauty in the simplicity of the story line, which nevertheless also consists of complex and timeless issues. I have never been able to forget this movie. Here are some aspects of it that I think of often:The role of the seer. I sometimes think maybe Antonio shouldn't have teased his wife about visiting her after the woman predicted he would get a job. Whatever your beliefs are about such things, for the purpose of the movie, that part makes me wonder.The role of the family. In Italy, and I suppose other Latin cultures especially, loyalty to your own family sometimes surpasses objective logic. Think of the thief's mother's defense of him. She has to know her son is possibly not totally innocent, especially if the whole family lives together in one room. Something about her behavior tells me that she is also covering for him in spite of her better knowledge. You also see the old man that the thief underpays (not sure what the payment is for, probably a cut for some crime or favor), yet the old man's instinct is to pretend he doesn't know anything about the thief when Antonio asks. This theme, of family and friends covering each other's wrongdoings points to why the thief has grown to confidently be the way he is. With this blood is thicker than water mindset, no problematic behavior is uncovered and corrected - it is nurtured and allowed to fester and get worse. If you apply this same theme on a larger scale in terms of government and bureaucracy, you can see why certain societies are prone to corruption.Issues of bureaucracy. If you look at this objectively, there's even a problem with the stupid job Antonio gets gluing posters to a wall. Antonio claims that the pay for it would allow the family to be comfortable with a small allowance in addition. But the bottomline is that he is just sticking movie posters to a wall. It's almost as of in this poverty-stricken setting, the government employment office is making up jobs, almost like a sort of a disguised welfare. Perhaps knowing that people don't want to feel as if they are on welfare, but they can't be left jobless either, so the government seeks to fabricate jobs to address the issue. You also get issues of bureaucratic indifference, such as the police administrator who flippantly takes a record of the crime submitted by Antonio, but has no other suggestions for him or words of support (especially since he is eager to hang out with his buddies at a last-minute shindig). Or the police officer who offers to search the thief's mother's apartment, but doesn't search it properly, just looks under the obvious places like the beds (how many of you saw the blanket apparently covering something at the far rear of the room? I'm not talking about the uncle's car tires, which were hidden to the left of the entrance to the room, I'm talking about the blanket covering up something in the far rear). The police officer spends most of the time talking about the status quo, which is great, at least he's showing some sympathy to Antonio. But his search effort is pathetic. The police officer is almost like a case in point. A little off-topic, but it also makes me think about the seer's words (either you will find it - the bike - suddenly, or you won't find it at all). And as soon as Antonio leaves the seer, he spots the thief. Who knows if he might have ended up finding the bike after all if the police officer had searched the thief's apartment more thoroughly.Evil eye. A concept familiar to many countries globally, including Italy. It's the belief that when something good happens to you, and you have something that others want, you need to take steps to protect against evil eye, or else other people's jealousy can intercept and cause bad luck. When the employment officer called on Antonio for the job, think of all the men waiting directly behind asking \"what about me!\", or eager to take his job when he mentioned that his bike was at the pawn shop. Something to think about when you consider the stream of bad luck that ensued after Antonio got the job.Theme of the bad guys getting all the support, while heaven forbid you slip up once. It's pretty obvious in the movie that every time Antonio needs help, he only gets very sparse, if at all any, help. The thief, a true crook, has the support of what seems like everybody in his neighborhood at the drop of a hat. The thief even has the support of the old man he underpays at the plaza. Antonio slips up once at the end and steals a bike - which is very out of character for him - and a crowd of people including the bike owner successfully grab hold of him. Not at all condoning Antonio's actions at the end, as his desperate act was obviously wrong, but just pointing out the theme of the imbalance of support.Some alternatives. Could Antonio have looked for alternatives after losing the bike? Of course the employment officer said he needed the bike, but what if he had tried going on foot for a while and wait to see if he gets fired. It seems to me that even though the workers each had a bike, they were still carrying the ladders by hand, while the pails of glue were being awkwardly supported by a well-placed hand on the handlebars. Walking with these items might have been easier. Also how many different walls would need to be poster-covered, and how far away would those walls be from each other? Reminds you of those job listings containing some unnecessary qualifications. Finally, Antonio's son Bruno worked at a gas station. Perhaps he could have taken a moment to talk to Bruno's boss and see if maybe he himself had a bike tucked away somewhere that he wasn't using during the day, and give it back to him at the end of each day when he went to pick up Bruno? Just some food for thought. Sometimes we can get stuck in a bit of tunnel vision and not consider all the options at hand.Rich people aren't always the bad guys. Yes they seem to most often look out for their own interests, but sometimes in doing so, they provide a trickle down effect that may benefit the lower classes (although paying more of their fair share of taxes, and losing access to other ways of cheating the system might be even more beneficial, but I'm not going there right now for the purpose of this review). Think of the job that Ricci got putting up movie posters. The stupid job paid fairly well and more than it should have because most likely an American movie company was funding it (actress Rita Hayworth is featured on the single poster we get to see). Finally, in the end, the bike owner of the bike Antonio tries to grab seems like a rich guy. Though he initially calls for Antonio to be sent to the police, he sees the child Bruno and has a change of heart. Sure, another rich guy in the same situation might not give a damn and demand that Antonio get his just dues. But it still points to the fact that the wealthy cannot always be blamed for every problem in society.I'm sure I can find other aspects of this movie that I think of from time to time, but the ones I listed are the ones I often ponder.I am a true fan, this movie gives me a lot to think about.

            "review_title": "Bicycle Thieves deserves its great reputation as a subtle and intelligent tragedy",
            "content": "Bicycle Thieves is a character study about a man struggling in postwar Italy. The scene is set early with massive unemployment and everyone struggling to get by, including Antonio, our protagonist. The opening two scenes showcase both the general societal struggle to find employment as well as Antonio's willingness to sacrifice for a job. His wife, Maria, sells his sheets to pay for the bike he needs. When it ends up being stolen, he will stop at nothing to get it back. He drags his son around town in a wild goose chase to find the stolen bike, but it's clearly trying to find a needle in a haystack. We see his desperation and manic energy grow as he sees no good paths forwards. The spiraling feedback loop of his failure making him more desperate which leads him to be even more rash and aggressive reaches its peak when he feels he has no choice but do as was done to him.\nThere are three elements that elevated the movie for me. The first is the relationship between son and father. We see how the son trusts and adores his father, yet the father consistently leaves him to fend for himself and rarely talks to him in a direct or kind way. The shock on the son's face as he realizes what his father has done is the emotional climax of the movie, but we see he still loves his father and takes his hand, which reassures the father immensely as he feels everything is falling apart. The second is the subtle cinematography and script which shows the lives of the broader Italian community. Antonio's situation is not unique - that is made obvious from the opening scene where hordes of men gather to get any job possible, but we are reminded in small moments throughout the movie as he meets people and tries to find the bike. Yes, he is in a tough situation where he needs to support his family and his essential bike gets stolen, but really his plight is far from unique or extreme. This ties into the final and most important element: the ability to have the audience empathize with Antonio despite his selfishness and obliviousness. In that opening scene, he is not in the crowd but sitting off to the side and has to be grabbed and brought over. In the following scene, he complains while his wife carries two water jugs home. Throughout the film he is oblivious to his son's admiration and love for him, and doesn't trust his wife to support him once the bike is stolen. He has no self-awareness in social situations, which ends up driving people away as he tries to get them to help him. In the church, he makes a scene which ends with the old guy running away, and then in the alley he accuses a young kid and doesn't back down even as a large crowd threatens him. Despite these flaws, we still are emotionally invested in Antonio's journey and are relieved when his son holds his hand and he's allowed to go home. I'm very curious to see how my perspective on Bicycle Thieves and cinema more broadly changes as I begin Film History II tomorrow.",

            "review_title": "Real World Problems Subjected to Realism",
            "content": "This neo-surrealist Italian masterpiece from filmmaker Vittorio de Sica is a classic by many standards and remains one of the top films of the century. The flawless link between the socio-economic problems of a post-World War II Italy and the criminal leanings of the disenfranchised peoples of that country are melded seamlessly. Looking at just one family during this period, the film follows the breadwinner Antonio Ricci (Maggiorani) around town as he tries to find his stolen bicycle. He has his young son (Staiola) in tow which makes it that much more humiliating when it becomes almost impossible for him to find it anywhere, whether he's perusing the marketplace or hunting down the thief himself. He becomes more unsettled as the day wears on, because he needs the transportation in order to keep a job, and the world around him seems to be more concerned with revolt and propaganda than real world solutions. The film speaks volumes about how crime is elicited by people based on their neediness and the fact that most crime stems from the government's inattention to societal problems. Italy was in a shambles after the deconstruction of Mussolini's government, and at this time there was a large gap between the rich and poor. Besides speaking about Italy's problems in particular, this film also speaks about the origins of crime itself. There is no villain to the story about the stolen bicycle, only a narrative about the state of life for the people who steal and are stolen from. Both sides are getting screwed overall, but one decides to take a different path to gain agency. Having his son with him seriously makes this a tearjerker on top of everything, because he has been thieved from, and left to take care of his family with absolutely nothing. It really makes you think about the complexities of the human condition and how people truly see welfare. It tells a universal and yet very sad story and it does so in a heart wrenching and poignant way.",

            "content": "The 1948 film Ladri di Biciclette (The Bicycle Thieves) has generated enough acclaim in its life so there is hardly a necessity for another review, but as an aspiring screenwriter, after I came across a 1950 NY Times article by Arthur Miller that praised the film for its simplicity, I though I'd be worth examining for the purposes of learning about simple filmmaking. How to make a great film based on a simple story with very few characters. Arthur Miller calls this one-track conflict of a film \"to be very close to a lyrical masterpiece.\"The plot is simple: Jobs are scarce in Rome yet the protagonist Man fortuitously procures one. This job requires a bicycle which the Man also fortuitously procures. During the the Man's first day on the job his bicycle is stolen. The rest of the film focuses on his crusade to find the stolen bicycle and thereby remain employed.There is a real aesthetic beauty as the Man and his Son tramp the streets, the camera follows, and the city dominates. Rome is so influential that characters lives, their interactions, and their relationships are molded and shaped by her. As the man follows clues to track down his bicycle he transverses what seems like the whole city. Moving from one Roman neighborhood to another, new scenes mean new characters, and new characters mean new conflicts.There are many touching scenes between Man and his Son, but one especially where we think the Son has hurt. This scene reaffirms that the Man's true priorities are first and foremost with his family, but within seconds the Man is pulled right back into the chaos of the hunt for the bicycle. Throughout the entire film injustice reigns, paired with the utter simplicity of the film's production, Ladri di Biciclette is a truly remarkable achievement. An example of unadorned, simple cinema.",

            "review_title": "A timeless account of Human Struggle !!!",
            "content": "Although initially I had planned to write an elaborate review of 'Bicycle Thieves', but then I thought it really was a pointless act because millions of filmmakers, critics and fans have already established in numerous reviews, essays and homages why the film is masterful. So in the end, I decided to mention some magical scenes/moments in the film I noticed on this particular viewing that are either rich in humanism or which underline the general social conditions of war ravaged Italy :1. Subtle moment where Antonio helps Maria when she struggles to go down the slope carrying the two heavy buckets. 2. The smile on Maria and Antonio's face when the pawn shop attendant increases the exchange amount for their bed sheets from 7000 to 7500. 3. The shot where Antonio watches one of the pawn shop attendants carrying his family's bed sheets and the camera slowly reveals numerous,almost infinite bunch of bed sheets belonging to other families stacked on a towering wall of shelves, thus expanding the scope of the film in a social and political sense and pluralising the focus for a few seconds. 4. The moment where Bruno closes the window of the room before going out for work with his father in order to prevent the sunlight from coming in and falling on his baby brother/sister's face. 5. The moment where Antonio is being taught how to stick a poster on the wall and the camera suddenly shifts to two street boys who run after a rich man to ask for money. 6. The heartbreaking look on Maria's face when she becomes aware of the theft.7. The poetic moment where a bunch of chattering priests stand next to Antonio and Bruno to take shelter from the rain and subsequently we see the rain stall and the clouds disappear. As a matter of fact, 'The Bicycle Thieves' has a very interestingly ambiguous relationship with religion and mysticism. 8. The shot of Bruno standing alone at the top of a flight of stairs on a monument.9. The look of sheer joy on Bruno's face when Antonio proposes the thought of eating pizza. 10. The entire sequence in the restaurant when father and son temporarily abandon all pressing issues and decide to enjoy a meal together. 11. The shot where we see a woman with her child in the opposite apartment in the background slowly close the window as Antonio talks to the policeman in the foreground. 12. The look of sheer horror on Bruno's face as he sees his father being chased by a mob. 13. The close-up of Antonio's face at the very end of the film as he walks away with his son by his side. That haunting look on his face has the power to reduce even the hardest of men to tears. 14. The very last shot which was inspired by Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is pitch perfect. It again expands the scope of the film. We the audience say goodbye to our primary characters, as they walk away towards an uncertain future, again becoming a faceless part of the Italian working class. 15. Although this isn't a particular moment per se, but the music by Alessandro Cicognini deserves a special mention. The basic score of 'Bicycle Thieves' has an inherent despair and a sense of melancholy that is deeply moving and inescapable.It is a clich\u00e9, but it's a clich\u00e9 worth repeating every time, 'Bicycle Thieves' is a stone cold masterpiece. Although it belongs to a specific time and was a result of specific social circumstances, one doesn't need to be an Italian who had lived during the post WWII era or even have any awareness of what Italian Neorealism means to feel its power. 'Bicycle Thieves' transcends temporal, cultural and social barriers due to the timelessness and universality of its humanity and its emotions. In a matter of 90 minutes, De Sica manages to perfectly showcase the kind of circumstances which might force a human being to compromise and abandon his/her subjective opinions and stances as well as objective conceptions of morality. There is no right or wrong, good or bad. Poverty and the basic need for survival can create a situation and a society where every person is only a few moments away from becoming a 'bicycle thief'.",

The film's story is, of course, a very tragic one but It's still enjoyable and doesn't vapour your mentality, like in other films like for example Au Hassard Baltazar, no Bicycle Thieves still has a touch of delight.I also love the actors in this film they are so real and fits perfectly with their roles and environment, I read that's because every actor is actually from the community and none of them is a professional actor, which really just a bonus and make the film more realistic.

            "content": "This is not a happy film. A post-War film about survival in a country that's been partially turned into rubble by the conflict, the story is about a man whose entire family's living is dependent on his government granted job as a poster placer. For this job, he needs to have possession of a bicycle. Then the titular character comes in and steals the bicycle and the man and his boy go on a desperate hunt through the city to find it.In part, this is a study on the effects of desperation, in desperate times, on a person. We watched as a proud man becomes increasingly desperate to find what is the only salvation for his family in his mind. As a result, we watch him fall from his pride and optimism towards hopelessness, watching as his pride breaks and he becomes increasingly willing to take previously ignored measures to recover his bicycle. During this journey, we watch how this also affects his human relationships with others, as it takes a toll on his relationship with his son, as well as how he interacts with those related to the theft.By the point The Bicycle Thief was released, it had already been a couple years after the War, but it's easy to imagine that the Neo-Realist tradition of Italian film-making was still quite alive and the influence is no doubt seen in The Bicycle Thief. Everything appears to have been shot on location, the camera work is a combination of hand-held and placed shots and the direction is straightforward and observant, not taking fancy liberties. And that's entirely appropriate to such a gritty story.It's not a perfect film; at times it runs close to melodrama and some of the irony is obvious, but the story was still crafted in a way, that I was muttering under my breath to the main character, \"don't do it!\" and \"over there!\" For that, the talented cast, and the willingness to grapple the tough moral quandaries of what is and isn't permissible in times of desperation, I imagine that The Bicycle Thief will remain a classic piece of film history. Great work. 8/10.",

            "content": "One of the film's strongest themes is how desperation places people in situations to make sacrifices. This theme is demonstrated on multiple levels throughout the element of production design. From the very beginning of the film, the viewer is introduced to a very destitute environment involving distressed citizens arguing for job offers, tattered clothing of Antonio and his family, the barren house in which they live, and the meager circumstances they succumb to in pawning their bed sheets to buy a bicycle.Further proof of this desperation is illustrated at the pawn shop. Crowds of poverty-stricken people align themselves to pawn/sacrifice whatever material possessions they have in hopes to receive enough money to get them through the day. All sorts of items (props) are sold here including: binoculars, bed sheets, shoes, hats as well as bicycles. One of the structures built on set that capitalizes on this theme is inside the pawn shop. There is a towering shelf about 100ft in the air that holds thousands of bed sheets. The implication here indicates that the entire city suffers from a desperate need to survive and make sacrifices.The bicycle itself is a symbol of sustained living that counters the desperation Antonio and his family is under. Without the bicycle, Antonio does not have a job, and if he has no job, he makes no money, which in turn means his family does not eat. When his bicycle is stolen, the feeling of desperation heightens as he searches the streets of Rome to find it. When his hopes begin to diminish after searching all day in vain, it begins to heavily rain outside. This aspect of production design reinforces the weight Antonio is feeling\u0097thus fulfilling the platitude, \"When it rains, it pours.\" There is a special moment captured in the film that places this awful desperation on hold. Feeling like all is lost, Antonio and his son, Bruno, go to a restaurant to escape from their dilemma. The atmosphere there is very joyous including a live band, people smiling, and good tasting foods. There is a wardrobe contrast shown between the rich and the poor: Antonio in rags and the rich in fashionable attire. All these aspects ironically support the main theme.",

The scenes in the church, and the alley way when he confronts the theif, and then the bridge scene all seem to drag out the narrative in a way that for me personally I find tedious.

            "content": "It is an immortal classic and now I know why. What a brilliant piece of film making at display! It is close to impossible to better this piece of work for many reasons, most importantly because it would take an event of the order of WW II to be able to do that. Of course, one can recreate it through a period drama but you can not recreate what isn't real(or neoreal) anymore with the same effect. The movie depicts the social,economical and cultural panorama of Italy(focus on the lower/middle class) which is still suffering from the after effects of the war and is trying hard to limp its way out of it. Vittorio De Sica shows it all without ever focusing on it but through a very simple story in the forefront. There is no fuss around the story, there are no sub plots, there aren't any superfluous scenes either. The plot is as simple as it gets. It's the reality of characters and the treatment given to the film that creates a winning combination. The skill of director is such that withing ten minutes into the movie, one starts to relate with the protagonist and empathise with his situation. This certainly doesn't happen because of the problems and challenges the protagonist faces. Its the liveliness and realism that each frame of the movie possesses that completely absorbs the viewer into it.The impact of the movie is accentuated because at the center of the plot lies a father-son duo. Its a relationship which is mostly understated be it the reel life or the real, which of course opens up the possibility of multiple layers. Once there is so much screen time available for this relationship to be portrayed, magic is always on cards, all it takes is a magician who can play the tricks right from his heart and for once not keep anything away from his audiences. This is exactly what Vittorio has been able to do here. If, like me you have also seen Life is Beautiful(1997) before Bicycle Thieves ,you will constantly be reminded of Bengini's masterpiece and which will in a way amplify the goodness of the experience. The fact that the kid here was also (Just like Lamberto was not a pro prior to this role of his) directly picked from the streets gives an immensely raw and mature feel to the kid's character and that reflects directly in the quality of each scene.His expressions, mannerisms,and specially the reflexes are too real to have been directed by anyone.The brilliance of the movie also lies in the fact that it is being filmed in the same city of Rome which has those typically beautiful Europeon streets, lanes, walls, bridges and markets. These characteristics would have otherwise perfectly catered and serviced to the tastes of people who have special liking for these but yet the plot and its presentation is so strong and gripping that one hardly gets a chance to wander away from the core of it.Bicycle Thieves, which is nothing less than splendid till its final chapter begins to unfold, transcends into the realm of immortality within a matter of minutes with what transpires. In those few minutes, you would look at yourself inside out (there are chances you might end up feeling naked), you would see those 'moments of truth' from your past flashing past your eyes at frantic pace and you are bound to experience a range of emotions at once. This was one of the very few occasions in my film watching career where I have found myself inside the frame as the movie begins to throw the end credits",

            "content": "I'm working my way through IMDb's top 250 in chronological order. So far it's been worth the effort finally experiencing all those often referenced Classics, movies that prove they are timeless if they can still get a high user rating from the modern internet crowd, reading up on them on Wikipedia afterwards and learning a thing or two about the production, the actors and the history of cinema in general. Some alright but forgettable movies, some pretty decent ones and some that have really surprised me and made an impression.There have only been two real stinkers so far: The mindbogglingly atrocious ' The Passion of Joan of Arc' (don't watch if you don't want to tear out your hair in frustration) and now this movie right here: Bicycle thieves.So, a short synopsis: A family man, Antonio, on the brink of poverty, living in post-war Italy needs a bicycle for a well-paying job. His wife pawns their bed sheets, 3 new ones and 3 old ones, 6 in total to be exact netting them 7500 lira allowing them to buy the bike for 6100. His job is to glue advertising posters on billboards. First day on the job his bike gets stolen....and then the movie dissolves into one boring stretched out scene after the other culminating into utter pointlessness by the end of the movie.Anybody who ever got his bike stolen knows you're likely never going to see it again. Instead of looking for realistic solutions Antonio decides to run around town. first he and a bunch of half-wits go looking for it on the market the next morning, where vendors chop up, repaint and resell bikes in bulk. Unsurprisingly they don't find the bike yet this ordeal goes on and on with the characters repeating the same sentences several times.\nLater on as by some miracle Antonio spots the teen who stole his bike talking to an old man. After a failed chase Antonio with son Bruno in tow follow the old man to some sort of charity church, hassling him for information on the bike-stealing teenager. Again this scene goes on and on and many of the same lines get repeated over and over again. Finally the duo get what they want, an address, yet Antonio decides to waste his time first with a fortune teller.\nAfterwards they run into the kid, and you've guessed it, the scene devolves into a long drawn out repetitive shouting contest between Antonio, the teen, his mother, a cop and all the random locals who pick the teen's side. Eventually Antonio is forced to give up and walk away empty-handed.There are some additional scenes in between the ones mentioned above that are supposed to develop Antonio and his relation with Bruno but they're poorly written and I couldn't care less by then.Now instead of all the above silliness, what if Antonio... simply bought a new bike? I mean if they come at a price less than that of 6 bed sheets I'm sure he could pawn of a few more things to buy a new one. Maybe he could ask for an advance on his wage? Ask the advertising company to buy him a bike and take the cost out of his wage? Does he really even need the bike? You can hang up a lot of posters in a day on foot, couldn't he have struck a temporary deal with the company to hang up posters on foot for a smaller wage, just until he can buy another bicycle. By the way, all that time spent chasing the thief he didn't show up for work, does he still have a job to go back to or is he already fired?This is not a movie that allows for asking too many question, lest the whole plot gets derailed.At any rate, the movie ends with a very predictable conclusion. Antonio decides to steal a random bicycle himself in turn. BET NO ONE SAW THAT COMING! What occurs then is so unintentionally comical it destroys any semblance of realism or authentic emotion. And this is supposed to be a neorealist film mind you.\nSo what happens, Antonio picks as his target an unattended bicycle in an empty street. Ok, smart choice. Except the moment he touches the bike, as by magic a guy pops out and shouts THIEF! In mere moments half the city is chasing him. Funny how that goes, because when Antonio's bike was first stolen and later when he chased the teen on his bike, both times through a crowd, Antonio was also shouting THIEF! Yet not a single soul acted out to help him. The contrast between these scenes is so extreme, it makes the whole plot feel forced, arbitrary and even bizarre.After getting chastised for a while by the mob that caught him Antonio is let go and walk off clearly distressed. And.that's.it. That's literally the ending.In my opinion this as a movie that should have been forgotten. It doesn't belong in the top 250 let alone at the 100th place. I think broad strokes of people today can still enjoy the classics of Chaplin, Keaton, Hitchcock, Capra, Wilder, Kubrick, Welles, Kurosawa and so forth. This movie however is only here because it's been carried al those years by the snobs, the elitists and the \"critics\".",

            "content": "In the post-war era when neo-realism was en vogue, Vittorio De Sica's \"Bicycle Thieves\" (1948) was considered by some to be the greatest movie of all time. True, it lost ground in the following years, but only to bounce back recently thanks to film critics who try to unearth the defining moments in 20th century cinema. This undoubtedly is one of them.Together with writer Cesare Zavattini De Sica made many fine movies, among them the no less famous \"Umberto D\". \"Umberto D\" is sort of a twin brother to \"Bicycles Thieves\", as it represents a variation of themes introduced in the earlier film in many aspects, but both of them are social realism at their very best. Low on budget but with a lot to say these pictures simply show realities and omit the overblown pathos film productions tend to often put before the first line of a plot is even written. The impact on viewers interested in seeing reality is thus much stronger. The neo-realistic roots not only show in the way the scenes are filmed or dialog is spoken, also the actors in \"Bicycle Thieves\" were throughout non-professionals. The main character, Lamberto Maggiorani, a simple workman of Breda, left his own work for two months to be in the film. Enzo Staiola, who plays his son, was a poor child, a son of refugees himself, clearly aware of the suffering lower class people went through after the war. Their performances are magnificent, and De Sica has a simple explanation for that: They are not playing roles, but themselves. Maggiorani tried to stay in the film industry, but would never surpass his portrayal of Antonio and forever remain one of the great faces of neo-realism - the face of a simple worker, be it from Rome or Breda, in life or in fiction.",

The reason one might find it boring is because it tells the story of the common man, his struggles and his relationship with his son. During the 1940s, Hollywood made melodramatic films  with characters that few could relate to.  Also in the 1940s, Italy was still feeling the effects of WWII, were many struggled to make a living.  Few films in that time chronicled the lives of the average man.  \"The Bicycle Thief\" is one of the most ground breaking films in history because of this.To all those that found the film boring, please, watch it again.  Notice all the bicycles (and bicycle parts) in the film; the protagonist only needs one to keep his life and family together.  Notice the touching looks the child gives his father, and how his father hardly notices him.  Study the injustice surrounding him, and have empathy for him.

As we sympathize with Antonio, possibly attempting to justify his actions in our mind, we must then analyze the young thief who stole Antonio's bike, the cause of our frustrations from the beginning of the film, and give him the same sympathy. Perhaps he was only trying to feed his family as well. Nevertheless, that didn't give him the right to steal another's livelihood, to put Antonio's family at risk. In the same way, Antonio's desperation doesn't give him the right to potentially put another man's family at risk by stealing his bike. Owning a bike becomes the conduit through which selfish survival instincts allow man to exploit man. It also leads us to ask questions like: Does one society's need justify the misuse of another society? De Sica presents these questions to his audience by creating characters with which one can easily identify, and whose actions can be easily interpreted. It is through our reflections and interpretations that we can then know ourselves.The most respectable aspect of De Sica's film mastery is the way in which he gives the characters of The Bicycle Thief dignity and personal values despite their disadvantaged situation. Antonio's friends who work all night collecting garbage, then help him search for his bike all day are the epitome of compassion and friendship. His wife, as well, in her giving efforts to secure a job for him, exemplifies great consideration. De Sica skillfully pushes the audience to consider the seed of arrogance within Antonio that drives his actions, while maintaining in him a man deserving of our understanding.",

The Bicycle Thief is seen as the flagship representative of Italian neo-realism, and it is more \"important\" than it is entertaining.  This film drags and drags and drags, but that's the point. This is \"realism.\"  You are taken on the man's quest to find his stolen bicycle.  The scenes are long, mostly dead-ends, and many times you are unsure of where he is going or what he is doing (as he is).  The Bicycle Thief and Italian Neo-Realism is an interesting experiment in film, but nothing more than that.My critique of neo-realism is that we already have something like it, and they're called documentaries.  What this genre does is it essentially takes the worst of doc and non-doc films.  In a documentary, when something gets long you can look past it because IT IS REAL... and the very nature of it being real makes it engaging (if done well).  In a non-documentary, the director can do whatever he pleases to add exciting elements and twists to a story (which neo-realism does not take advantage of).  This movement had to happen sooner or later, but it is no surprise to me that it didn't last. \nThis film is a must see for any student or buff, but if you wanna be entertained there are hundreds upon hundreds of better films out there. Nevertheless, The Bicycle Thief had a great \"feel\" to it that cannot be described, likely attributable to its realism.  Quite frankly though, The Bicycle Thief got very slow.

            "content": "Roger Ebert says, `The Bicycle Thief is so well-entrenched as an official masterpiece that it is a little startling to visit it again'.  The label classic is often prejudicing to the first time viewer, I know it used to be for me, but as I've seen more and more films the label loses some of its appeal.  If I had first seen The Bicycle Thief a few years ago, I bet I would have loved it.  But this Tuesday it didn't hold much appeal to me. The story is good, a man and his son hopelessly looking for a stolen bicycle in Rome.  The bike is an icon of money and food and the good life, but this was made in the post war depression and is fittingly depressing.  There is never really a chance to find the bike; it is all a false hope.  I'm sure this is how many Italian's felt who spent their days like our protagonist Antonio does at the beginning of the film, loitering around in an unemployment line hoping for the remote possibility of work.  I can see beauty in the work.  Some of the photography is very beautiful, especially the landscapes of Rome during the thefts and by the bridge, but still it does nothing for me.  The little boy who plays Bruno does a excellent job acting and is the cutest child actor I've ever seen, but still it does nothing for me. I think my biggest problem with the film is with the story. The basic concept appeals to me.  A man hopelessly lost in a city of despair.  But the execution is a little off.  I don't care about the characters.  I don't care if Antonio starves or eats, lives or dies, works or commits crime.  I don't care if Maria has sheets.  I don't care if Bruno wants spaghetti but only gets mozzarella bread.  Maybe there is nothing wrong with the movie and I'm just callous, but for arguments sake I'm going to blame the movie for not getting me involved.  It seems like there is no tension.  We know the bicycle is going to be stolen because of the title, the whole film is mired in depression so we just naturally assume things aren't going to work out, and at the first glance of the bicycle in the alley, we know that Antonio is going to steal it.  It just seems predictable.  Maybe that is a fault of its age and its conventions being used once too often, but I just couldn't get myself to care about the characters or even the film.  I'm guessing it was a lot easier at the time to get people to understand the characters because they were living it and it was every day to them, but for me as a college student in Iowa it has nothing.  It doesn't engage me, it doesn't entertain me, it doesn't make me care, it doesn't do anything but bore me.",

            "content": "Vittorio De Sica's \"The Bicycle Thief\" uses Neorealist techniques to portray a man and a society. The man is Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani), who goes on a quest to find his bicycle after it gets stolen on his first day at work. The society is post-WWII Rome, where jobs are scarce, money is tight, and nearly everyone is so desperate that they could be driven to thievery.\"The Bicycle Thief\" claims to be a slice of life, but it actually has been carefully scripted to ensure sufficient variety and drama. It utilizes as many different locations as possible: Antonio's search takes him to a busy pawn shop, a police station, an open-air market, a church mission, a restaurant, a fortune-teller's, and a brothel. All these different locations present a vivid portrait of post-war, lower-class Rome, contextualizing Antonio's story and defining Neorealism in the process. However, at times there is a little too much of this emphasis on location and atmosphere. The most compelling part of the film is the relationship between Antonio and his young son Bruno (Enzo Staiola), but it sometimes gets lost amid all the vignettes.After watching the movie, I was amazed to discover that the actors were amateurs--their performances are so good! Maggiorani is subtle, never hammy; child actor Staiola is endearing without seeming fake; and together they work up a very convincing father-son dynamic. If the movie sometimes loses its course when trying to address the issue of society at large, it never once falters in the realistic, moving scenes between Antonio and Bruno.For some reason, I like and admire, rather than adore, \"The Bicycle Thief.\" However, it's definitely a well-made, oftentimes compelling film about poverty and its effects on families. And, more importantly, it proved that \"well-made\" movies don't have to have glossy production values and famous stars, and that stories like Antonio's are worthy of being told on screen.",

            "content": "A beautiful neorealist film brilliantly depicting the extremely difficult economical and moral conditions of Italy immediately after WWII using a plot as simple as possible and yet so close to everyday life of a normal poor man. The movies starts with a man getting a job which requires him to have a bicycle (bike) and then shows us how he and his wife get one immediately from the repair shop and then as the title suggest his cycle gets stolen on the very first day of his job. He and his son are then out looking for a thief and bicycle without any luck and then finally we see the efforts in desperation of an unemployed man, father, and a family man trying to survive in the world. The whole time I watched the movie I felt as if I was feeling the pain, anger, desperation of our main actor as my own, the acting, direction and the overall movie was that excellent. The actors playing Antonio and his son are amazing and have excelled in their roles. The father-son combination is really good and their scenes steal the show altogether (be it in their home cleaning the bicycle, going together for work, looking for lost cycle and the final scene is simply moving). Also the photography and direction is top class. It's a wonderful experience going back in time and knowing what countries (especially the ones badly hit by war) was like after WW II and the depression, pain and agony of people living in them and What extreme measures they were forced to take to just survive.Overall I would rate this wonderful Italian movie 9/10.",

            "content": "On the surface Vittorio de Sica's Bicycle Thieves doesn't appear to have a story worth filming about, since it is about a poor man whose bicycle gets stolen while on the job, but de Sica has somehow given this neorealistic motion picture such depth and such emotion that it has turned into such a great and personal film which is loved by many.It has to be noted that this is a neorealism picture, meaning that none of the actors in the film were really actors, but random people who are usually associated with their respective role. I did not find out about this until after i watched it, and i was not beginning to doubt it since the actors in this film are just as good as professional ones. Lamberto Maggiorani, who was a steel worker, captures the inner struggles and desperation of his character perfectly with his exceptional facial acting and his true energetic relentlessness in searching for his stolen bicycle.One has to ofcourse understand the struggles of post WWII italy in order to relate to the financial situation of this film, since there were a lot of poor struggling families like the one we follow in the film, and their tale of forlorn attempts to improve. We also have some great black and white cinematography which visually also creates a narrative of its own of how poverty seems to reign in Rome, with many shots of poor homes. The screenplay is as simple as the movie but still consists of so many morally questionable and realistic dialogue such as 'There's a cure for everything, except death'. Also worth a mention is the incredible score by Alessandro Cicognini, whose violins accurately enhance the sad story that is being played out on screen.Especially the final thirty minutes are absolute world class, and the final climax ( Without spoiling anything ) shows its inevitable ending so greatly. The events that unfold in the film might be simple, but it's the kind of film that will make a great emotional impact on you even when the simplest things happen due to the truly realistic depressing feeling and the great connection with the characters.",

            "content": "In defining the Italian neorealist era, Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves (also known as The Bicycle Thief) is one of the greatest motion pictures ever made. It stands as a work of profound emotion, highlighting human frailty, the importance of objects and the circle of morality by telling a beautifully simple and elegant story set in the bustling streets of Rome.This movie is truly a work of art, a real and concise piece of passionate filmmaking by De Sica. In a time where most motion pictures functioned as paths to escapism, especially in Hollywood, De Sica's realistic look at the Italian streets and at the poor stood in stark contrast to the glitz and glamour produced in major studios. His Bicycle Thieves is a lean film, utilizing the suffocating poverty of Italy in its post-war era as a defining factor.Lamberto Maggiorani stars as Antonio Ricci, a poor father and husband looking for work. He is given a job, but the conditions require that he has a bicycle. Together with his wife (Lianella Carell), Antonio sells some bedsheets and procures a bicycle to do the job. He is elated, as you might imagine, and becomes overjoyed at the prospects of earning money to help lift his family out of abject poverty.One day, while working at his job of posting Rita Hayworth posters in Rome, Ricci has his bicycle stolen. He becomes frantic in the search, going to the police and using the help of friends to find the stolen property. With his son, Bruno (Enzo Staiola), he traipses through Rome in all conditions to track and hopefully recover his bicycle.Watching Maggiorani, who was a factory worker and not a trained actor of any kind, put life into Ricci is an astounding experience. The way he struggles, with himself and with the situation, to come up with a way to understand what has happened to him and to come up with a way to go on with his life is simply amazing. The bicycle is no mere object to Ricci. It represents his livelihood, his pride and his ability to pull his life out of the gutter to offer hope for his family.With this in mind, watching Ricci's desperate search through Rome takes on weight and urgency. As he pushes people aside to gather possible clues or to find people who may know where the thief is, we're with him every hurried step of the way. We're with him when he considers theft himself, too, and we see the distance growing between Ricci and Bruno as the man becomes more desperate and more upset.Bicycle Thieves is a wonderful motion picture in that it taps the realism of the streets and of human despair in ways that few other pictures ever have. Placing this film in the context of post-war Italy, a country burning with poverty and anguish, creates a deafening sense of trouble and sorrow for its characters. The raw emotion is inborn for this picture, as though the massive importance of the bicycle and what it means to Ricci simply never needs to be explained.From the relationship between Ricci and Bruno to the way Ricci elects to solve his problem, Bicycle Thieves is a movie filled with human frailty. It offers us a profound understanding of that frailty, treating it with respect and honour and dignity. The poor are not mere objects to shuffle aside, the thief is not a villain anymore when the story comes full circle and the lengths to which despair can take us are realistically and intensely explored on multiple levels. Indeed, Ricci's search through Rome mirrors our lives and our searches for individuality, meaning and respect.",

True, the movie doesn't make a point of contrasting his poverty with high-living millionaires (wealth is illustrated as the ability to buy a plate of spaghetti).

It is happiest that way.Such films stand outside time. A man loves his family and wants to protect and support them. Society makes it difficult. Who cannot identify with that?",

Sure Ricci has his bicycle stolen...right from under his own eyes in a place where thievery is common. He should have been paying attention better. yet no one mentions this aspect in all the reviews.Then, there are bicycles all around Ricci. Ricci has a job if he has a bicycle...yet he has made it this far in life that there is no one Ricci can \"cut a deal\" with to get a bicycle to use? It seems to me that every step of the way Ricci does something more stupid in life. Ricci is part of the lower caste because he is an idiot who didn't learn.Reviewers seem to be in love with romantic tragic presentation of the poor hard luck people...although some perceptive types do note that the true story is the story of the father\\son relationship. But I fail to see anyone noting that Ricci is in his desperate straits because of actions\\decisions that he, Ricci, took by himself.For most people in life the dividing line between success and failure are the decisions that we make...and learning from our failures. Ricci never learned. If you love weepy emotional stories of the poor downtrodden then this is one of the paragons of cinema for you. For this reviewer the one time viewing was enough.

And again an explosion of emotions took over me during the projection. Feelings of sadness, anger, compassion, helplessness, all mixed together.In a devastated post-war Italy, when poverty, hunger and unemployment prevailed, Antonio gets a job to put posters on the city walls, but to be admitted, he needed to have a bicycle. He had, but he'd pawned her off so he could buy food for his family. Maria (Lianella Carell), his wife, collects the sheets from the house and takes them to the pawnshop, where they get the money to take out the bicycle, in the same pawnshop.On the first day of work, after leaving Bruno, his 7/8-year-old son at work (the child was a gas station attendant at a gas pump), he starts working, taking with him a ladder and the posters to stick, all on his bicycle. As he finishes pasting a poster of Rita Hayworth, his bicycle is stolen. Antonio then begins a journey, accompanied by his son Bruno, in search of the thief and the bicycle. They pass the police station, a flea market where there was a large trade in bicycle parts, and even inside a church, where the poor were locked up to attend mass before being fed by a kind of soup kitchen. At the end, despairing, Antonio fights against himself, in a harrowing scene in which he is in doubt whether or not to steal a bicycle on the way out of a football game.Some points raised by De Sica are very good and very current: the precariousness of work, where we have the situation of child labor and the conditions to get a job, because he had to have a bicycle to work, which made me transport myself to the present day, especially during the height of the pandemic, when workers became unemployed and entered the labor market informally, many of them in food delivery services, for which they would have to have a bicycle or motorcycle. The so-called uberization, where the person is neither employed nor autonomous, having to work in precarious conditions, with no guarantee of social benefits and receiving a meager remuneration.De Sica, who was a communist and a Catholic, shows the manipulative and indoctrinating power of religion, especially in those who are most socially vulnerable. The scene inside the church, with the doors closed, preventing people from coming and going, having to hear mass so they can eat a plate of soup, is a clear example of this domination.And it is even contradictory, but also a love of cinema, making a realistic film, with a large part of the cast of non-actors, no filming in studios, with a low budget, De Sica incorporates in the story several posters of Hollywood films affixed on the walls of the company where Antonio got his job, but especially the figure of actress Rita Hayworth on the poster pasted by the main character when his bicycle was stolen.I also saw many similarities in the scenes with the boy Bruno, especially in the one where he sits on the sidewalk, with the film The Kid (1921), by Charles Chaplin.A necessary film for any cinephile.",

The film centers on a struggling working class father and husband who recently landed a job only to have his bicycle stolen and can no longer carry out his assignment. First of all this story is extremely simplistic. It's one of the most basic and easy to understand stories I've ever seen and that has its profound benefits. The lack of convolution allows the audience to feel the emotions of the circumstances these relatable characters go through while still maintaining a feel of rhythm and pacing for the thin plot. Most people watching these struggles can most likely empathize with the character about job hunting, providing for loved ones, being an example to children, and dealing with a chaotic environment that is both unmerciful and unpredictable. Performances were honestly wonderful from every performer (the child especially was surprisingly brilliant). Thankfully with the straightforward narrative, the audience is allowed to see the full range these actors can deliver. Another solid positive is the score. I found the music incredibly emotional and beautiful to hear. Having seen it, I see how the style of filmmaking has influenced other more popular and widely seen Italian releases like \"Life is Beautiful\" and \"La Dolce Vita\". Any disappointments I have with Bicycle Thieves inevitably fall under the expectation shattering category. I admittedly expected a more positive and hopeful vibe with an ending that felt optimistic. Both of which were untrue so these \"negatives\" if I can call them that, are more self- inflicted than one would care to admit. Despite the \"depressing\" and realistic approach the film takes to handle its story and subject matter. I found Bicycle Thieves a truly great film and would recommend it to anyone.

The film follows Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) whose family is experiencing extreme poverty and he finally gets a job to hang posters but needs a bicycle to have his job so has to sell household items to get his bicycle which ends up getting stolen after a day of work. The rest of the movie is about how Antonio and his son Bruno (Enzo Staiola) search for the stolen bicycle and to what lengths they go to.The film captures the desperation and poverty seen in the time through the characters of Antonio, Bruno, and Maria Ricci (Lianella Carrel) who are facing a large level of poverty. Moreover, when he gets a job there are many people who are seen outside the office who don't have a job and are demanding for a job, even the bicycle thievery can be considered a symptom of the conditions of the time. The movie truly takes a person back to those times and presents those conditions in an artistic way. The locations and the visuals of the film really show how the conditions of the time were in a way that the audience can connect even today in 2022. Moreover, the music of the film must be talked about in creating an emotion and making you feel for the people of the time before even meeting with the main characters and seeing their struggles.One of the greatest aspects of the film which solidifies its status as an Italian Neorealist film is the ending where Antonio is compelled to steal someone else's bike and he is left without any police involvement. The ending has no redemption or positive note showing that Antonio got his bike and is able to continue his job, but it has a realistic ending which only shows an increase in his desperation to pain a true and realistic picture of the time when most people didn't have a positive end to their stories.Overall, this is a good movie not only to learn about Italian Neorealism but also to watch a poignant movie with the right emotions to churn your heart.",

When the protagonist fails to find any help in all the institutions (police, church, psychic) that are supposed to aid him, he finally turns himself into a thief. However, when he is caught stealing a bike, the bike's owner forgives him in a very humiliating scene. After the protagonist has lost faith in all the institutions, when he depends on the generosity of an individual, he finds an act of grace and humanity: he is forgiven, and for the first time in the film, after being betrayed by everything, he is the recipient of a generous act.",

His wife sells some of their sheets, and with that money they are able to buy his bike back so he can start a new job. His first day on the job, however, someone steals his bike while his back is turned. He runs all over that area of town, but the case seems helpless. Instead of giving up his friend Baiocco (Gino Saltamerenda), and his little buy Bruno (Enzo Staiola) join Antonio in a search all over the city. Some of said this film is a microcosm for socialism, perhaps just about one man's search for faith (fides in latin, which is the type of bike he had), the epitome of Italian neo-realism, or perhaps just about poverty stricken Italy and the lengths one man would go to ensure some comfort for his family. Personally, I'm not sure which is the most important aspect of the film, but even if it's about none of these, De Sica has definitely created a masterpiece on human emotion and captured the essence of Italy during that time (post WWII). If you're debating whether or not to watch this, I would say believe the hype and ignore any negative reviews you hear, this film is one that needs to be seen. Rating: 32/40",

As a movement, Italian neorealism held its influence through the 40s, especially, and still maintains its influential power now, especially with its enduring classic, Bicycle Thieves.Bicycle Thieves centers on the story of a poor but hard-working family-the father is given a job in which a bicycle is required to carry out the tasks that come with this job. The father and son (beautifully portrayed by child actor Enzo Staiola) purchase a bicycle, but the bicycle is stolen from them, and now the father and son must retrieve their bicycle, so that way, the father can continue working at his job. And the rest includes what has gone down as one of the most memorable final scenes in all of film history.Bicycle Thieves is a film that simply gives us the cold and hard truth about life. It is a film that examines the hard life that usually isn't given much attention in cinema-the hard life, that, if given attention through cinema, has been sugarcoated with melodramatic and predictable endings.However, this is a film that confronts the hard truth of life that are rarely portrayed in cinema-and instead, director Vittorio De Sica subverts audience expectations-especially in the powerful final scene, where the father and son do not retrieve their bicycle, and instead, the father and son walk off in a moment of defeat and crushing sadness.This is certainly a downer of an ending, and was certainly influential for its time, and perhaps, it still holds its influence now. This is the kind of film that is not meant to uplift, neither is it meant to completely depress. It is one of those films that is meant to be honest about life, and honest it is.",

Bicycle Thieves talks much more than just the thieves of bicycle and bitter truths of a specific era are very well crafted in a storyline.Post-war Rome going through unemployment and poverty is how the movie starts in which \"Antonio\" - a husband and a father luckily gets the job on a condition if he can arrange a bicycle to do the job and after arranging it gets stolen. Going through the journey to find it back, the movie shows some aspects of society like how his wife sells bedsheets to a pawnshop to get back the bicycle which is already in that pawnshop and as the story goes on it portrays very strong thoughts through the scenes like \"Antonio is in church but totally focused into an old man who can help him to get his bicycle back but he never prays or even look towards Jesus's sculpture\" even after losing hope, he tries to chill with his son and goes to a cafe and eating there with rich people shows a beautiful contrast\", and in the end, after getting a chance to steal a bicycle, he does so and his kid see him stealing the bicycle and this scene is beautifully captured with the expressions and reaction of the kid which shows how he lost all his hopes.A father-son relation which shows in traction of finding the bicycle how Antonio is disturbed and ignores his son that he falls at some places, running behind his father and stay alone at few places, but in the end holds the hands and goes together.If we find ourselves into the movie, there are few technical reasons as well i.e. simple use of the camera, which shows only a few closeups and mostly human eye-level shots only in mostly natural light which at some places create beautiful silhouette shots.The beautiful story portrayed by the beautiful multiple character's performances present in the movie will obviously leave a mark on your heart.",

One of the scenes that is great to watch is when a bunch of workers on bikes are riding past the boy and his father. Each worker moves by slowly holding a latter, lined up in lines behind each- other equally spaced. As the bikes slowly pass by it creates the illusion that only the two main characters are moving. Each shot in this film looks like it was truly thought about in the making of this film. This film is like living in a painting of a depressing location.

What makes it so much better than that is that the father had just been let go by the mob that caught him, which makes the viewer think, wow, isn't he lucky, even though we know he's going to lose his new job because he doesn't have a bike. But he does have a wonderful son who loves him, and a wife at home who loves him, and there's a kind of sense that that makes it OK that he's got to go back to the nothingness he started the movie with. The whole relativeness of the situation is astounding.Perhaps even more fun is comparing the two mobs he deals with in the movie, the one run by a neighborhood mob boss protecting the thief (remember the tires in the apartment, and the mamma's comment \"we used to have a car\" - yeah, right) that is going to kick his butt for accusing one of their own of thievery, and the other mob, about to kick his butt for being a thief.

While Roberto Benigni's masterwork is a family-friendly celebration of life, The Bicycle Thief is a striking departure, even from other movies that depict the life of the lower class. Shot in the Italian neorealism style, the film plays almost like a gritty documentary, with a cast of unknown actors and a minimal script. The simple story is as sincere and humble as the characters themselves, without complex plot twists or numerous characters. De Sica is also a master of cinematography and editing, as seen in his stunning shots of the Italy, and his quick editing cuts near the climax of the film, which establish anticipation on part of the spectator. But the most powerful facet of The Bicycle Thief is the plight of Ricci, who cannot work without his missing bicycle. The audience is shown a world where a man's honor and his family's wellbeing is dependent on a bicycle, yet despite the desperation and poverty, hope is established with the bond the man and his son form while searching for the bicycle. In The Bicycle Thief, where people are so destitute that they would pawn off their bed sheets in hopes of employment, the most poignant aspect of the film, as seen in the final harrowing scene, shows how humanity triumphs over any material shortcomings.",

            "review_title": "The Pinnacle of Italian Neorealism",
            "content": "Bicycle Thieves is one of the most searing and heartfelt films I've ever seen. More than any other film from the Italian Neorealist movement, it represents all the virtues that characterize this style of cinema - on location shooting, little to no melodrama or cheap sentimentality, and a honest examination of contemporary social issues - while avoiding the somewhat stilted style that plagues other neorealist films.The story is a simple one. In the aftermath of World War II, Italy is mired in poverty and jobs are hard to come by. One man living in the slums gets a job that requires he has a bicycle, but on the first day his bicycle is stolen. Faced with the loss of his job, he and his young son scour the streets of Rome trying to get the bicycle back.The story has enough of a central focus to enable it to move along at a steady pace while retaining free from unnecessary complications that gives the narrative a chance to slow down and build the characters of the father and son or build a hopeless, despondent mood over the poverty and the indifference of humans towards the suffering of those less fortunate than themselves.Much like the story, the characters are rather simple, working class folk; however, simple does not mean two-dimensional and both the father Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) and his son Bruno (Enzo Staiola) give rich performances, no doubt helped by director Vittorio De Sica's own experience as an actor. Antonio slowly becomes overwhelmed by desperation and despair over the course of the film, culminating in him attempting to steal a bicycle himself and its hard to believe at times that he was a completely nonprofessional actor. Meanwhile Bruno is no less compelling, displaying a mix of childish idealism in looking up to his father that is tempered with a premature dose of cynicism over the circumstances he finds himself in. The other actors also give solid performances.The direction of the film is also stellar. Unlike other neorealist films which sometimes feature an austere directorial style, De Sica uses multiple cameras and dolly shots to give the film a snappy, dynamic style. While not showy, it gives the film a sense of energy that keeps it from getting bogged down in the dreariness of the subject matter and setting. That fact that the film had so many professional film workers on its staff is also evident in the cinematography by Carlo Montuori which is sharp and crisp with excellent depth of field. The editing by Eraldo Da Roma is also quick and decisive, knowing when to slow down to let the poignancy of a moment sit in, such as the end of the film when Antonio and Bruno are lost in the crowded streets of Rome, but giving a sense of urgency to others, such as the search for the bike parts in the open-air market. Musically, the score of the film is provided by Alessandro Cicognini, and is provides a nice mix of melodies that compliment the film well. While you probably won't be humming it to yourself days after you see the film, it nonetheless is a solid plus in the film's favor.In conclusion, Bicycle Thieves is truly worthy of being lauded as one of the greatest films of all time and serving as the definitive neorealist film. Don't let the simplicity of the story fool you, this is an emotionally rich film that shows that a film doesn't need to be complex to have depth.",

            "content": "Viewed in retrospect, much of modern cinema can seem to flow from twin fountainheads: Orson Welles's Citizen Kane (1941) and Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves (1948). Though separated by World War II, the two movies symbolize the cardinal impulses that came to captivate serious audiences, critics, and filmmakers after the war. Where Citizen Kane heralded the age of the auteur and a cinema of passionate individual vision, Bicycle Thieves renounced \"egoism\" for collective concern, envisioning a cinema of impassioned social conscience. The film exemplifies De Sica's stated desire to \"reintroduce the dramatic into quotidian situations, the marvelous in a little news item... considered by most people throwaway material.\"The quotidian anecdote dramatized here concerns Antonio Ricci, a young husband who has been suffering a prolonged spell of unemployment when he is offered a job as a bill poster. The catch is that he must have a bicycle, and his is in hock. Rescued by his wife's willingness to pawn their bedsheets, Antonio set's out proudly and confidently on his new job, only to have his bicycle stolen on the first day. Desperate to stay employed, he mounts a wide-ranging search across Rome, accompanied most of the way by his young son, Bruno. (Godfrey Cheshire)[...] it is a spectacle, and what a spectacle! Bicycle Thieves, however, does not depend on the mathematical elements of drama; the action does not exist beforehand as it were an \"essence\". It follows from the preexistence f the narrative, it is the \"integral\" of reality. De Sica's supreme achievement is to have succeeded in discovering the cinematographic dialectic capable of transcending the contradiction between the action a \"spectacle\" and of an event. For this reason Bicycle Thieves is one of the first examples of \"pure cinema\": no more actors, no more story, no more sets, which is to say that in the perfect aesthetic illusion of reality there is no more cinema.

            "review_title": "Good Movie but not the Greatest",
            "content": "I am very bored with Hollywood and have been trying to check out more art films, classics, foreign films etc. I saw this is sometimes touted as the greatest film ever made. I thought it was good but the greatest? Not too sure about that. This review is going to ramble.In post WWII Italy, poverty abounds. I really think this movie was made to speak to the common man and inspire sympathy in those of a wealthier class. Our protagonist, Antonio, is out of work when he gets a job posting from the unemployment office. The job requires a bicycle which Antonio has to retrieve from the pawn store. His first day on the job, the bike is stolen. He then goes on a quest to find this bicycle with his son Bruno.As for how the movie aged, I think it's done just OK. The very poor quality looks like it was made in the 1920's and not the '40's - Gone With the Wind is 9 years older. Also, some of the son's expressions were slapsticky which I hate slapstick humor but OK, it was a common form of comic relief at the time. The constant background chatter was annoying.As for my impressions, you can certainly draw lot of meaning from the movie. Some, I'm not sure if it was intended to be there. (My point is I learned in 3 different classes (2 in college) that Miller used the name Loman (low man) in Death of a Salesman to describe his character. Miller, himself, said it wasn't intentional.) Yes, you can see that the government, the police, and the church (who lock in the impoverished so they have to stay for the mass to receive charity) offer little relief. Also, the poor are constantly at odds with each other instead of uniting and challenging the rest of society that blissfully ignores them.This is how I saw the movie and why I think it was to inspire sympathy in the lesser fortuned. Antonio is a good man, his circumstances lead him to do something you thought he would never do, steal. I love when movies create a moral gray area. As much as I didn't want him to steal the bike, I also wanted him to get away with it. Don't judge so harshly, who knows what one will do when they are completely desperate.The other main meaning I took from the movie is what the soothsayer said. She tells the \"ugly\" boy don't continue to sow a field you can't harvest. Then she tells Antonio that he will find the bicycle immediately or not all and to open his eyes. The open your eyes line leads Antonio to confront the boy on the street, though, I'm not sure if that boy is supposed to actually be the thief (I hope he isn't). You assume that the open your eyes line was saying that the bike is under his nose, if he would just look harder, he'd find it. What she really means is to see the truth, the bicycle is gone. Don't keep sowing a field that won't harvest, let go. Granted, there are few other fields out there for him to harvest... but maybe there are, maybe he can rent a bike? Unfortunately, Antonio doesn't let go and this is what leads him to steal.This is me \"Loman-ing\" this movie (putting my own meaning into it). I see the bicycle as representing Antonio (or any man's) dignity which is tied to being able to support his family (less so now but it's 1948). Society has taken his dignity from him but it is returned when he gets a job. However, it is again stolen from him. This is why he goes on a relentless pursuit. In the end, you can't steal dignity and this leaves him even lower than before.The relationship with the son is also a nice element in the movie. I thought the smacking scene was great, you felt the sting Antonio felt (remember, dignity stolen) when the son mentioned the soup (though he shouldn't have hit him). Also, Bruno's reaction was fantastic, you really felt how wrong the slap was. The son seeing the father steal was also heartbreaking. There is probably more that can be drawn from here but it's not what I focused on.Lastly, I thought the movie was good but not quite great. It's more of a quiet and simple film, though, it does punch you in the gut in the end. You feel sadness and kudos to any movie that can make you care about the characters and evoke that strong of an emotion.",

            "content": "The 21st century viewer might wonder what Ladri Di Biciclette, a movie made in 1948, might have to offer in the year 2005. The answer is simple: Ladri Di Biciclette is about post-war life in Italy and post-war misery does not change. One who is interested in the cinema and the motion picture as an art will find a lot in this movie; brevity, attention to detail and honest expression. The movie is so brief in story telling that it reminds us of the bitterly strong albeit brief short stories of Anton Chekhov and those of Edgar Allan Poe. This brevity is owed mostly to the attention to detail the production had; every scene's detail is arranged in such a way that the viewer would see what he or she would need to see to understand life there and then. The movie tells us about the misery of life as it was for the people of the post-war Italy in such an honest language that it is hard for the viewer to find a glimpse of exaggeration or overt dramatization. Those features probably will be subject to scholarly work in the movie industry for many years to come; however, and more importantly, the movie's study of post-war misery remains noteworthy after more than half a century. We are witnessing many wars in our times, and this movie allows us to close our eyes and imagine what might happen in those countries affected by wars in the years to come. For those who may be interested in how it would be like after a war, Ladri Di Biciclette is a window to the future. Saeed Payvar.",

Their interactions and simple day-to-day things have been presented artistically. There are obviously no wide-angle or high-flying shots, or anything grand in terms of camera work. The strong point of this classic is showing life on screen as it in reality is. Everyone is aware of their hardships and has accepted poverty as being a way of life.

No scenes have been pictured with \"glumness\" as such, but watching these scenes; the melancholy that surrounds you is a testimony to director class.It is not a movie with fairy tale ending rather a perfect ending. In the end the protagonist resorts to desperate measures and repents, leaving us all with a sad thought, a bit of pondering and harsh realities.8.3/10",

            "content": "Life can be a cruel experience. From war, discrimination and inequality, life certainly has a lot of misery going for it, but its still so beautiful and worth living. Life is therefore paradoxical in nature and it's impossible to solve.Bicycle thieves is a neo-realistic drama that stars both professional and non-professional actors and portrays a simple story from post war Italy. The story features a struggling father that manages to get a job with the requirement of him having to own a bicycle. With life looking to better itself, society shows its true colours, and his bicycle is then robbed. The movie then shows the enduring journey the father must take in hope of retrieving his bicycle and in result his upwards trajectory.With a simple story like the one in Bicycle Thieves, the question that gets asked is how you manages to make the story meaningful and interesting. Director Vittorio De Sica manages this by making the story terrifyingly realistic by shooting the scenes in a relatable manner. Every scene looks like a scene that could take place in real life circumstances, and they probably do from time to time. The story asks moral questions which are to this day relevant.The moral of the story is, that no matter how unfairly you get treated, you should always protect your humanity and treat others like you want them to treat you. No matter how big of a camel you need to swallow, you should swallow it, if it makes your sanity healthier. Your own humanity is worth more than showing inhumanity to others.Bicycle Thieves displays important moral topics and is one of the definite neo-realistic movies from Italy. I'm not the biggest fan of neorealism and its approach to moviemaking, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.My rating: 84/100.",

Bicycle Thieves is a movie which has garnered universal acclaim and love. Its legacy is inescapable.The first thing that comes to mind, when one hears of Bicycle Thieves, is neorealism. Italian neorealism paved the way for films and filmmaking which defined a generation. It shunned the star-studded, high on adrenaline blockbusters and brought to screen the post WWII life in regular Italy.The plot of the film is sublime and simple. It follows a man's quest of finding his stolen bicycle - something which, for him, is as big of a matter as life itself. Post WWII Rome, struck of unemployment and poverty, wasn't an ideal place to inhabit. The old, fragile structures and a great mass of people - all facing hardships - make it look like an inescapable maze. And therein, Antonio Ricci, accompanied by his son Bruno, wanders, without any clue, in hope of getting a sight of his lifeline - the bicycle.As we go through the film, our sympathy for Ricci increases, but the way he merges in and emerges out of the crowd makes us realise that he is not the only one struggling in pathos. Ricci is not just one man, he is a symbol, a medium to express the excruciating relentless of life in Rome - a place where poverty, unemployment, and the desire to overcome it is all pervading.In the opening scene, the use of stairs and subtle use of low angle on the crowd and high angle on the officer make a statement on the difference. As Ricci gets the job offer, he seems to be ascending, but as soon as the necessity for bicycle arises, he is pictured low and vulnerable by the camera - which also uses deep focus to enhance the feeling of Ricci being one among many. In the sequence, when they are running around the buildings, they look small and vulnerable in the frame; the backgrounds look all the same and they've got no clue whatsoever. The film is full of such meticulously-crafted, moving scenes.Not only the hardships, but the film takes a dig at superstitions, political conditions and reflects many events through the eyes if Bruno. The father and son relation too, is in the very centre of the storyline.De Sica used non-professional actors - something which is astonishing given the brilliant performances - and the working class Rome for shooting. This too, is indicative of Ricci being one among the masses, and nothing special.The haunting beauty of Bicycle Thieves leaves us wondering as to what cinema can capture. It's thematically rich, visually moving, and aesthetically unmatched. Bicycle Thieves is, rightfully, one of the greatest movies ever made.",

I was already very familiar with the movie being on several critics' list for \"must see\" movies but this part made me even more skeptical. Why? Because many of the reviews focused too much on the wonderful cinematography, how the film represents the Italian neo-realist film movement, the greater social issues of poverty and austerity measures of the time, and the psycho-social father/son dynamic. Well, all that's nice but is the movie good? The answer is a resounding yes! This 1948 film is way before my time but I connected with it as strongly as any film from today.The plot is very simple, a father named Antonio is in desperate need of work during post World War II era in Rome. He finally gets a job opportunity posting advertisements but it requires his bicycle which he has already pawned. His determined and supportive wife gathers all the bed linens to help raise money and retrieve the bicycle from the pawn shop. The father's son, Bruno polishes up the bike, noticing a small dent and admonishing his dad for not pointing this out to the pawn shop manager. The son is instantly adorable! The father is elated with his new job which comes with a regular salary and housing stipend. However, on the very first day of work, the bicycle is stolen. The rest of the movie involves the father's search, accompanied by his son, for the bicycle. This movie is infuriating as you experience the apathy of the police and community to the father's situation. As the day prevails, Antonio becomes more desperate and all that he stands for as a man and father begins to disintegrate. The best movies are the ones that stir intense emotion whether it's joy, sadness, fright, etc. This movie is maddening. You understand the final actions of the father but you also are deeply pained for how it forever changes his son. Thanks to all of you that encouraged us to watch this film.

And watching it was an unforgettable experience.

The movie revolves around his desperate search for the thieves and how the turn of events influences his relationship with his little son who goes along with him on the forlorn expedition to locate the lost bicycle. The fervent desire of his son to find the bicycle stands out to watch. Impressive acting and brilliant cinematography carry you along with the narrative.The movie is also an astute visual commentary on the aftermaths of war- how it renders people helplessly searching for a living, their struggle to support their families, emotional upheaval, its ruining effect on the economy, etc. It's an ordinary plot with an extraordinary appeal. Not surprising, it is voted greatest movie of all time in 1952 in an international poll by a British Magazine.

When Bruno looked at the baby, then closed the window, I didn't know whether to think he was being responsible, or the parents were being irresponsible.It's cool when Maria takes off the bed sheets, the mattress starts looking smaller and flatter, revealing how poor they are.After Antonio buys the bike, I get so nervous whenever he sets it down, because the title is the bicycle thief, and I know what it means for him if he doesn't have a bike.The way the police officer described the purpose of a complaint made me understand that there is nothing that could be done. However, making the officer speak to him more sympathetically would've helped to convey how helpless Antonio is. I was lost while they were searching for the bikes, because the shots were wide and shaky, so there was no time to look at each bike. It was like looking for a needle in the world's largest haystack. The active city space with everyone moving and hundreds of bikes made a very stressful scene.",

            "content": "How can amateurs, who haven't ever done a movie before, put in such stellar performances?! This was my first reaction on learning that Vittorio De Sica had used first time actors in this brilliant Italian neorealism movie.Bicycle Thieves is set in post war Rome where the protagonist Antonio Ricci is looking for a job in order to earn a living for his family. When he finally bags one, he ends up losing his bicycle which was an essential requirement for that job. As he pursues the bicycle thieves along with his son amid hopelessness, we are made aware of the prominent themes persisting in those times.This movie is one of the pride gems of the Neorealism movement. A story set among the working class, filmed on location and using non professional actors, that deals with the difficult economic and moral conditions of post war Italy, representing changes in the psyche and conditions of everyday life, including poverty, oppression, injustice and desperation. Well put Wikipedia.Lamberto Maggiorani puts in a flawless performance as Antonio Ricci. Enzo Staiola as Bruno Ricci and Lianella Carell as Maria Ricci complement him ever so well. The subtle emotions are the ones best captured in this movie: How Antonio feels disappointed at not living up to Maria's expectation, how young Bruno smiles at the mention of Pizza, Maria's eagerness to know more about the compensation of the job, and there were loads more.Themes of the church, seeking refuge in sages, solace and entertainment in football, syndicates of thieves are prevalent in the movie. Both Antonio and Bruno carry with them the emotions of the viewer as well. One is so engaged in the movie that you feel the pure joy when they're able to purchase the bike, commiserate with them when the bike gets stolen, feel pity for them as they wander around hopefully, feel unjust and hard done by as their pleas are rejected by the police and sheer helplessness and despair at the conclusion of the movie.There are certain scenes that are absolutely exquisite. The scene when Antonio feels that Bruno jumped off the bridge and his subsequent attempts to placate him, ending with him asking Bruno to sum up how much his job would pay just to keep him involved in his pursuit and not feel lonely, is also wonderfully done. How Bruno looks over from time to time at the adjacent table only to be admonished by his father. The sequence in the church when a desperate Antonio couldn't care less for the proceedings and chases the old man all over the church, was great. The moral dilemma that Antonio finds himself in at the end of the movie is one of the best scenes I've seen. Again, the acting in that scene was impeccable.\"There's a cure for everything except death\". What a thing to say to your kid! But then it sums up quite beautifully the bleak optimism of those times. Hats off to this masterpiece!",

And yet, I still am quite worried when I leave it unattended for like 5 seconds. I mean, it's like leaving something valuable lying in the middle of a street, it just doesn't feel comfortable.And in this movie, you've got this dude, who not only is poor, had to give away the sheets of his bed to have his bike. The whole livelihood of his wife and kid completely depend on the bike. He lives in a place with tons of poor people who have no way to make money. And he treats his bike like it's not very important, like he doesn't really care about it. Oh and big surprise, someone steals it. No wonder his wife was going to see a seer for answers, he's a complete imbecile.Am I supposed to sympathize in any way with this guy? Because that seems to be the point of the movie. Well, I absolutely don't. I have more sympathy for the workers who wanted the job but couldn't have it and that we see for 2 seconds at the beginning. These guys looked motivated. These guys wouldn't have let someone take their bike like it was served on a silver platter.And let me tell you, with no empathy for the main character, this movie is quite a chore to sit through, we have to see him bother other people to help look for the bike, he runs around everywhere around town for 5 hours, at one point his son (who he forces to go around with him for some reason), his kid asks if he could have stayed at the church to eat some soup, and in response he hits him and tell him to shut up, that he deserves to be hit... I mean, it's like the movie is trying to make me care less and less about him ever finding his bike.Dozens of other movies have shown characters in miserable situations and done it a million times better than what we have here.",

            "content": "MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS: Vittorio de Sica's The Bicycle Thief uses several formal film elements to illustrate the depressed economy of the post-war Italy in which the film takes place.  One element that really struck me was the mis-en-sc\u00e9ne in the film.  The most striking of which, was the pile of bags of linens.  When Antonio and his wife, Maria, were forced to pawn their linens to afford the bicycle, the man in the back that had to put away the linens had to climb, what seemed to be stories of bundles of linens. Seeing how many people had to pawn their bed sheets really affected me and proved to what an impoverished state this family/town was in.  Another aspect of the mis-en-sc\u00e9ne that was effective were the costumes, especially Antonio's frayed and worn jacket.  This was really apparent in the restaurant scene when Antonio took his son Bruno out to eat.  They were the only ones in the restaurant in such disheveled clothing.  Bruno kept catching dirty looks from a well dressed little boy sitting at another table because Bruno was wearing his torn up jacket and shorts. In the beginning of the film a large group of men stood outside waiting to hear news of jobs that were available to them.  All the men looked poverty-stricken and some were hostile.  All of those unemployed men had to stand outside waiting to hear about `good government jobs', and for many, only to be denied. The Bicycle Thief makes for a great example of neo-realism in Italy in part because of all these great examples of mis-en-scene depicting the depressed economy of Italy.",

            "content": "Ladri di biciclette, also known as Bicycle Thief, is directed by Vittorio De Sica, and produced by Giuseppe Amato. Filmed in 1948 in Italy, Bicycle Thieves is a neo-realistic film which deals with the poor economic conditions of Italy in the Post World War II era. The film stars Lamberto Maggiorani in the lead role of Antonio Ricci, and Enzo Staiola as Bruno Ricci, the son of Antonia Ricci. In the supporting cast, Lianella Carell plays the role Maria Ricci, the wife of Antonio Ricci.Bicycle Thief, very articulately depicts the conditions of the poor people in Italy after the World War II. Poverty, crimes, unemployment, and depression were the main issues during that period. Although, hard to relate for me with it, this cinema somewhat reminds me of the 70\u2019s era of Bollywood in which poverty, unemployment, crimes were also the main issues. Also, the frustrations of the protagonist to overcome all these issues, and to break his morals and take the wrong way in order to fight with these issues, are similar between these two cinemas.The most debatable point in the movie is the stealing of bicycle by Antonio. Is it right to commit crime of any level when you are in trouble? Is it ethical to put someone else in trouble in order to get rid of yours? These are some questions which Bicycle Thief raises. In my opinion, it\u2019s not right to commit a crime like stealing etc. to get some money. No matter how difficult your conditions are, taking the path of crime is always wrong. I maybe sound philosophical but I believe in \u201cWhat Goes Around Comes Around\u201d. If you\u2019ve done something wrong today, intentionally, you\u2019ve to bear the consequences later or as many people call it, Karma.The ending of the movie supports my point; after stealing the bicycle he\u2019s caught by the public and humiliated in front of his own son. I don\u2019t think there is any bigger insult than that for a man i.e. getting caught stealing something in front of your son.And he clearly knows it and that\u2019s why he asks his son to wait somewhere else before stealing the bike. He didn\u2019t want him to about it. He didn\u2019t want to lose his respect.\u201cBicycle Thief\u201d is a great learning experience, both in terms of film making and how to live life in general. I think the one of the strongest points of this film is its unpredictability. The director creates the situations such that you start to think that he\u2019ll get the bicycle back but you are always proved wrong. For example; when Antonio and his friends go to cycle market to find his bicycle, they meet a guy who is painting a bicycle and they think that he is a thief and it is his bicycle. And when that guy refuses to show it to them, they call the police. And just when you think they have found it, it turns out that guy is telling the truth.Also, the situation where Antonio runs after the thief gives you an idea that he\u2019ll find the bicycle but you\u2019re mistaken again. These small things create the suspense which was required in this cinema. The most surprising element of the movie is the acting and that\u2019s because Lamberto Maggiorani was not a trained actor at that time and he used to work in a factory. And, Enzo Staiola was only seven when he was cast for this role. To see such powerful performances from both the leads coming from non-movie backgrounds is mind blowing.On the whole, I absolutely loved this movie. It\u2019s a great piece of cinema and I\u2019m not surprised that it\u2019s being considered as the best neo-realistic film ever.Screen play of the movie is top notch and direction is superb. Despite being a very old film, I enjoyed it a lot. It has the perfect blend of commercial and meaningful cinema. It\u2019s the ending of the movie which really touches your heart, and makes it a masterpiece which it is today.",

This film is about a man named Antonio who finally gets a job by hanging posters.  In order to do this job, he has to use a bicycle to get around town in which he has one but has to buy it out of storage.  On the first day of his job, somebody steals the bicycle and Antonio is unable to catch the thief because no one helps him. The next day Antonio and his son go looking for the bike only to run into many obstacles along the way.  The two are able to find the thief of the bicycle, but are unable to do anything about it because there were no witnesses and no proof.  Antonio is so depressed that he decides to steal someone's bicycle but gets caught in front of his own son. The narrative techniques are much different then what you would see in many other films.  Throughout the film, there are many instances that make the audience believe that Antonio is going to get his bicycle back and the family is going to live happily ever after.  This doesn't actually happen though.  Antonio gets one chance after another but always falls short and it makes one believe that he has to get the bike back some how.  The film shows all these bicycles running around and you just think to yourself that one of them is going to be his.  The film kind of keeps you in suspense of how the film is actually going to turn out.  One thing that I found interesting about how this film was done was when Antonio's bicycle was stolen and later when he almost caught the thief, no one helped him.  When Antonio decided to steal a bicycle though about 10 people tried to stop him and succeeded. The film is telling the audience that just because one person gets away with something, doesn't mean that everybody will.",

Antonio Ricci (the father) finds a chance to work at a good city job pasting up postures around the town.  At this time the community would do anything to find employment of this kind.  Because they are short on money his wife sells bed sheets to receive money for a bike that he needs in order to keep his new job.  On his first day of his job his new bike that he just got gets stolen and he tries to do everything to track down the thief.  With a chance to try and get his family out of poverty he takes his son Bruno and some friends and head out into the city to try and keep his family an opportunity to get wealthy. With many frustrating events that occur through out the day Antonio decides to steal a bike himself and later getting himself caught and thrown in jail.One important factor in this movie is how the thoughts in Antonio's mind never get brought out to us throughout the movie but are shown to us through his facial expressions and the way he presents his body and emotions. Another factor that is important in the movie is how there are no staged settings present.  This movie uses real life settings and backgrounds that help give a better feeling or realism and makes the situations more effective to the eyes.  Finally the ending is also important.  After the prison feels sorry for Antonio and decides that he has gone through enough they let him out and the movie just ends abruptly with Antonio and his son Bruno taking a walk back through the town.  The movies uses this strategy to once again give a remembrance of the time its set in and also leaves the audience with something to unravel.",

In this film the main character gets a job when all other people could not get one, and gives his heart to keep it.  However, in the end it does him no good.  His family worked so hard to keep themselves living and going in the cruel and poor world of Rome, but a thief had to change all of that.  Through the course of the film the man's desperation builds and builds feeling that he is going to lose his new job and his new life all because of a thief.  The entire film is meant to make the audience feel remorse for this man and what is happening to him.  I felt remorse before he even lost his bike, because I knew it was going to happen.  The makers of this film want people to realize that you need to make sure things are going to go well for you, not hope and pray they will.  Going to a psychic as in the film did no good for their situation.  People rely on hope to much, and those people are the ones that get no where fast.  Near the end of the film the man is tired of looking for his bike and wants to get some food for himself and his son.  The bond between his son and him is so enormous.  At times it seems that the kid is more of an adult then the father.  The father always scared, or nervous and the kid always voicing his opinion; the film not just about the bicycle I believe it is also about him and his son.  Showing that even in times of desperation your family can try help you out even if that help is hopeless as in this case.  A big political issue is that even though he found the person who took his bike, and he knew it was him he could do nothing.  Politics today and back then said you need to have proof of the act, and since the man had no proof he could not do anything.  If he did, and they found this kid to be innocent of the crime the man could have been the one in jail and not the kid.  Politics are a very important part of how this world works; we need them to maintain order. However, in this case it seems that politics and law made more crime and less justice than it is suppose to.  Seeing this guy walk away from the group of thugs knowing that there was no more hope at all could have made anyone feel bad.  The big social issue is forgiveness.  The reason is that the man was so desperate he went to steal a bike himself.  However, for him he got caught and was going to be sent to jail, but the man he stole it from let him go because he saw this man's son and felt he had enough problems. Forgiveness is a very important part of everyone's life, because without it you will be a very sad person.  This film overall was very depressing, but a good example of how hope can not solve everything.",

Just watch the son's look during the climax of the film (close to the end of the movie). A seasoned actor would not act so superbly. I strongly recommend everybody to see it. It is a timeless classic!",

It got to the point that you just wished he was successful at the moment he tried to steal the bicycle. Everything happened in two days and contradicts all the movies I have seen before of that time. De Sica makes and excellent job choosing the role of Bruno and the kid makes an excellent job performing. Another outstanding point in the movie is how not only Antonio but the whole family are full of happiness with Antonios' job.Is this movie one of the best ever? probably I heared a lot about it before seeing it so I had very high expectations. Thinking about it in a more objective way, it was an excellent movie that made you part of it.",

            "content": "Spoiler The Bicycle Thief is a classic example of Italian Neorealism.  As of many neorealistic films that display some sort of personal struggle, this one displays a powerful message of society and Europe's post-war struggle. The film portrayals a young man, Ricci, and his son, Bruno, as they search for a stolen bicycle during a time of depression in Italy.  From the beginning to the end, the film centers on the dreary aspect of a desperate man's struggle to survive. The film displays the message of society's struggles and of Ricci's hard life throughout the entire film.  It expresses this by being in black and white.  This view gives a distant aspect to every scene and relays the message that what is scene is all there is that there is no deeper meaning to anything, the meaning that all there is this struggle to work.  From its scenes of angry workers debating over solutions to the economy to the police and church turning down Ricci's pleads for help displays the neorealistic message of society and its struggle at this time.  The mise en scene of the film expresses the message of Europe's post-war struggles as well.  From its long shots to its panning of the streets and building to the character's clothing and movements gives one the impression of Italy.  Through this mise in scene realistic view, the feeling of Italy as it was at the time, and with that impression the people's struggles are found to be believable.Lastly, the final scene of Ricci becoming so desperate that he decides to steal a bicycle is the best example of the films message of society. Ricci's attempt to steal the bicycle in front of his son Bruno finally displayed the measures that Ricci would take.  This is foreseen by his increased desperation throughout the course of the film.  In the scene the panning shots of him pacing and close-up shots of his face give away the fact that he is about to steal the bicycle and destroy his son's exaggerated heroic view of his father.  This event finally makes Bruno realize the reality of the situation and his father's disposition and struggle in this society.",

            "content": "Tukta Phetasa March 24, 2014 Art 102: \u00c1valos Bicycle ThievesA roller-coaster ride of emotion Bicycle Thieves captures your undivided attention with its brutally honest take on Post War Italy. The Italian Neorealism was a movement in the film industry that generally characterized the daily lives of the lower class. This included showing the whole truth of living in poverty, oppression, injustice, and desperation in that time. Bicycle Thieves highlights the desperation in the Italian neorealist movement by showcasing the desperation a man faces trying to support his family. This story surrounds an inanimate object to draw forth your emotions. Not because of what the object is physically, but what it symbolizes as whole. The bicycle itself symbolizes salvation for a family in need because without this bike he cannot do his job and without his job he cannot provide for his family. This movie features Lamberto Maggiorani, who is not a professional actor he plays Ricci a man that lands a job hanging movie posters. This job requires that he must have a bicycle but Ricci has pawned it off to get money to pay for food. He knows that everyone around him is desperate to find a job so he lies and says he will have the bicycle by the start of work. He tells his wife that he finally finds a job but he unfortunately can't accept it. He is sad because he feels as if he cannot catch a break because every opportunity is ridden with false hope. His wife gives him the sheets to pawn off and trade it in for the bicycle.There was a scene where we were falsely misled into thinking the bike was going to be stolen when he takes his wife to a psychics' house so she could pay her for her husbands good fortune. Ricci doesn't know what she is going to do so he gets curious and follows her up even though she tells him to stay put. He tells someone to watch his bike as he goes to see what his wife is up to. Everyone thinks that this would be the moment that his bike would be stolen so you watch with a bad feeling in your gut. He then stops his wife from wasting money on the psychic by saying that he didn't get the job because she came to see him. He reports for work and someone teaches him how to paste the posters and as he is going on his own and is posting his first poster someone takes off with his bike. This seemed to be a group effort as someone rides off with his bike and someone else steers him into the wrong direction. There aren't as many people who were willing to help him capture the thief. The police weren't much help either after he goes to report the stolen bike. He then goes to his friends and they and his son Bruno go searching all over Rome trying to find his bike. Eventually his friends give up hope leaving him and his son to continue the search. Ricci gets desperate as he goes on a manhunt with his son. He starts accusing everyone and reveals that everyone is in the same boat as him. They are all dealing with poverty and despair as everywhere shares the same everyday struggles to find a job and support their family.Speaking of family, his son Bruno steals the show because he pulls emotions from you that you wouldn't otherwise get from just watching the father desperately search for a bike. Bruno showcases his fathers' insufficiency to provide for his family as he ignores his son. One scene he gets so frustrated and fed up that he slaps Bruno, as horror rushes through Bruno's face he walks way from his father. Then a huge crowd gathers as someone is yelling about a boy drowning in the water. Ricci rushes to the water petrified and filled with regret as he discovers that the boy was not Bruno. After this sigh of relief he still doesn't apologize or rejoice that his son is alive. In another scene we see that he is almost hit by a car but his father doesn't seem to care as he has an expressionless walk contemplating revenge. The cycle is about to repeat itself as Ricci tries to steal another mans bicycle but in his desperation and unsuccessful attempt at trying to even the odds. He gets caught and this time there are tons of people who try to stop him, as his boy Bruno watches in shock of what his father had just done. In the final scene the man reluctantly lets him go instead of putting him in jail as he sees Bruno's frightened and sadden look. In the end he doesn't get resolution but instead he gets humiliation, his son was his savior and Ricci loses all his self-respect. De Sica truly captures real emotions by captivating the audience with real settings and a nonprofessional cast. He makes it pretty predictable by making it extremely believable and not too far-fetched to understand. Ricci's dry emotions really capture his distress and humiliation.",

            "content": "In the movie, \"The Bicycle Thieves\" we are able to see the meaning of Ne-realism at it's best. Neorealism defined as a style of filming prominent in Italy after World War II, characterized by a concern for social issues and often shot on location with untrained actors. This film seems really \"real\" to the viewers and we are able to connect with Antonio. This film was filmed in the streets because after World War II, studios had been destroyed. In the film we are able to see Antonio's struggle to better himself to help support his family. It is social issue we can all relate to. It's a story of an illusion that was shattered when his bike was stolen from him. A major emphasis put on the bike throughout the film as the search to locate the stolen bike in the streets of Rome begins. Not an easy task but to Antonio this bike is so important; it represents a job, a home, food, and family. It's an illusion that Antonio has that he's tempted to steal a bicycle himself due to his loss of hope. Getting the bike back is all that is Antonio's mind. In the film, \"Bicycle Thieves\", we are able to see the cycle of theft and poverty as Antonio makes the ultimate decision to gain his stolen bicycle by doing the same and stealing another man's bicycle in his desire to reach this illusion that represents a better life for him and his family.The bicycle in this film is of high importance; it symbolizes the working class status as the important motive, presenting a Ne-realistic Italian society after World War II. The film also contains a logic that shows how contradictory and disappointing life can be. Antonio is offered a job requiring a bicycle. Not having one, his wife Maria pawns some household items in order to acquire the needed transportation. Then on his first day of work, the bike is devastatingly stolen. He needs a job because he has no money, but to get a job he needs a bicycle, a bicycle costs money, which he surely can't afford. This goes to show part of the cycle of theft and poverty with the last scene of the film to completely demonstrate the cycle. In the opening scene we are able to sense the pain of neglect as we see a crowd of unemployed men rush forward as the officer is announcing the name of the lucky man. After two years of being unemployed, Ricci is finally offered a job as poster hanger and we're able to see the happiness it's brought him. As Ricci stands out, the camera allows us to have a view of the crowd. Instead of directly shooting at people's faces, the camera portrays the back of their heads. Then as the camera turning around, we finally see a group of young men waiting for the moment when the officer calls their names. De Sica uses the dehumanized images to allude and to show what the government sees these people (Doubon.com). As the viewers, we see them as young muscular Italians; however, for the government, they are just a group of livestock waiting for the meaningless jobs.The scene I have chosen to analyze is the scene where the father steals a bike from a side street and gets chased by a crowd of people. We are able to see the humiliation this creates for both his son and him. Antonio does not carry those characteristic traits to go out and steal from people. The situation he was in is what led him to the decision to steal the bike of another person. It might not have been the right thing to do but he had lost all hope. Getting another person back seemed to be he's only chance he had of getting back to his job after he tried everything. He tried to do everything he could in order to get it back, searched everywhere and even when he had the robber in front of him the police couldn't do anything. To me the above scene is the most dramatic and intense part of the film. We are able to see an emotionally erratic son chase after his father because he sees people grabbing him and shouting at him. Even though, these are untrained actors, it is incredible to see how well they display emotions. We feel a connection with the little boy when see the worried expression painted across his face and the tears of sadness. We can't help to feel sorry for both of them because we know the circumstances he made that action to steal a bike. Poverty was a key driver to the actions of Antonio and we are able to see it in the film and how it plays an important role in it. We are able to see a city in ruins with people in ripped and dirty clothes which helps reinforce the idea of poverty in Italy at the time. This explains the reason behind Antonio's desperation to get his job back by locating his stolen bike. Even though, the bicycle is the main focus throughout the film, poverty is what lies behind it. If he was not poor, the bike would mean nothing to him. But this bike symbolizes a job that he desperately needs during this hard times. We are able to see poverty when his wife goes and sells their bed sheets to obtain the bicycle in order to attend his first day of work The film succeeds in creating empathy for Antonio's dejected state so that his ultimate act becomes an understandable and painful reaction. It supplies one possible answer to the question: What makes a thief?",

DeSica did a fine job portraying the misery and poverty of post WWII Italy. One could argue that it is Bruno, the young boy, who is in fact the driving force behind this film. It is his balanced performance, displaying both the youthful innocence of boy and the matureness that can forced upon youth when on faced with the responsibility of taking part in the family's survival, that really make this film special.

There are many timeless issues and emotions, people being people at all times and places, that occur in this film. Therefor it's important to keep in mind four currents of thought, that have previously been identified, in post-war Italian intellectual life: Marxism, existentialism, sociology and psychoanalysis. The Marxism, as seen as a socialist societal commentary, is evident in the very nature of the story: class differences, poverty and unemployment. Existentialism is seemingly rife in the film, every scene commands the viewer to witness the deep meaning in everything that the characters undergo. Sociologically, this film is an interesting look into the social structures of the times and place in which it was made. Finally, the psychoanalysis rampant throughout. The turmoil, inducing neuroses, almost psychoses, in the lead character as he hunts frantically for the restoration of his dignity, his bicycle.",

            "content": "SPOILER!! Disappointment, hardship, and in the end desperation are the reoccurring concept in The Bicycle Thief.  All of these concepts go right along with the Italian Neorealism movement.  The movie starts out with a shot of a crowd of people begging for a job.  There are only three jobs given out that day and one goes to the main character.  The first problem arises when the job requires you to have a bicycle.  The main character almost turns the job down but relies how badly he needs it.  The only solution that is reached is by the wife of the main character gathering the sheets off all of the beds to sell for money to get a bicycle.  When the Main character goes to sell the sheets you see the extent of the poverty not by just this family, but by all as the camera taking a long shot of the thousands of sheets on the shelfs.  This leads the viewer to think other familys must have to do the same thing to get by and it is very depressing.  The next day is filled with temporary happiness.  The main character goes to work and is excited about the next day.    The next day you are reminded of their sad situation when the boy rides on his father's bike to work at a gas station.  This would be unheard of to have a boy working when he is so young.  The father then starts to put up posters.  It is his first day and you see him struggling to get the hang of it.  As the main character is working hard his bicycle is stolen.  He try's to chase him in the hopes to catch him but loses the thief. The main character then goes home and cannot face is wife to tell her.  When she comes and finds him to find out she starts to cry.  The next day the main character and the boy leave early to try and find the bicycle before is gets taken apart and sold.   While in the bicycle market the main character sees the thief but the thief once again evades capture.  The thief was seen talking to an old man luckily they do catch up with.  The main character then try's to get the old man to tell where the thief lives. The old man escapes without giving any information up.  Then the main character tells his boy to stay on the bridge.  There then are screams that a boy is drowning and the main character and viewer thinks it is his boy. Relieved that the boy is not dead they go and eat.  As they eat discussing as the main character dose often in the film how great of a job he had and how much money he would have been making.  Making the viewer feel worse about the bicycle being stolen.  After that they are walking and run in to the thief. The viewer is filled with happiness that the poor man might get his bicycle back and keep his job.  The thief denies the charges and because the man can produce no witnesses to the crime the thief is left without charges and the bicycle is not recovered.  Not only is the bicycle recovered he is almost beaten up for almost getting the thief in trouble.  If it was not for the boy who ran and got a police officer just in time the main character would have been beaten and have his wallet stolen.  With almost all hopes lost for the recovery of the bicycle the main character walks aimlessly around in despair. Then the main character comes a cross what he needs a bicycle sitting all alone up next to a wall.   The main character is being torn apart in side as the camera gives long shots at the bicycle leaning up by the wall.  Finally the main character decides he needs the bicycle to badly and tells the boy to take a cable car to another street and stay there. The boy knowing what his father is going to do dose not get on the cable car. When the main character try's to steal the bicycle he is seen and chased down by a mob of men.  They catch him and start looking for a police officer to throw the man in jail.  The only thing that saves the main character is once again is his boy coming to the rescue yelling for his father.  The man then decides not to press charges because of the boy and lets them go. The movie then ends without you knowing if the man finds his bicycle, loses his job, or the reaction of his wife.  All you do see is the son grabbing his father's hand to show his love and forgiveness.",

            "content": "In this remarkable 1947 drama, many aspects and underlining themes become apparent.  Taking place during Italy's devastating post World War 2 depression, De Sica uses the real-life environment in the streets of Rome to present his story.  The strong connection of the father to son is very apparent and key during the whole presentation.  During the voyage together to find the bicycle, the wandering pair walks through everyday crazy life painting a quiet innocent picture of father and son.  In another particular movie, we see the connection of father in son in Life Is Beautiful.  In the concentration camps, Roberto Benigni makes the horrible experience into a game for his son.  The connection between father and son holds true during this experience portraying the innocence like The Bicycle Thief.  This landmark film helped identify the Italian neorealist approach showing real life details, detailed imagery, and everyday life.  Italian neorealist cinema was a huge movement that grew out of a political movement after World War 2, following fascist rule.  Jobs were very hard to come by and the economy was very poor revealed as the film unfolded.  Taking place in the heart of this movement gives the audience a great visual to understand and appreciate the tale.  The use of a particular object was used very distinctly throughout the course of the film.  When the bicycle became apparent on screen, the father's heart was touched shown by his actions and facial expressions.  While cleaning the bicycle the morning before work, his son smiles with joy as the sun pours into the room.  When walking around, he carries the bicycle like a fragile new born child. After his bicycle was stolen, his heart was broken acting depressed like he lost a dear friend. His sadness and anger took a path which led him to the conclusion of the film.  Since these times in Italy were horrendous, the bicycle became a valuable object and friend to the father.  Overall, this story is simple, persuasive, and very powerful.  The father to son connection painted a true family bond.  The use of the bicycle controlled the father's feelings and state of mind.  The poetic film style shown through the Italian neorealist movement makes this epic complete.",

My immediate reaction upon seeing this was that the bicycle would be stolen here, I thought to myself, \"how predictable\". But then, as Ricci and his wife walk back down the stairway and the doorway comes back into the frame, I see that the bicycle is still there. Then it dawned on me: The only reason I thought the bike might get stolen in the first place was because of the film's title, De Sicca had used the title of his film to make the scene suspenseful! It was at that moment that the film had me hooked.The brilliance of Bicycle Thieves lies in its simple yet effective story. Following the precepts of Italian neorealist movement, began by Roberto Rossellini, De Sicca filmed it on location and used only untrained actors. The realistic tone of the film helps to ground it and make it more relatable. This is not a story about superhuman heroics,it doesn't feature any crime lords, fairy tale lands, or over the top violence. It's simply a story about a man who needs a bicycle to support his family and loses it. Yet it's so compelling. That's the power of cinema, and that's why I love Bicycle Thieves.",

The two actors who carry the film, Lamberto Maggiorani as the film's protagonist Antonio Ricci and Enzo Staiola as As Antonio's son, Bruno are phenomenal performances.\nStaiola is intentionally not a professional actor to give a realism to his character which the film pulls off quite well. Almost every scene in the film revolves around these two characters in some form or another making these two characters' relationship the lifeline of the film as it slowly unfolds, and crumbles slightly with a truly tragic ending.\nThe film attacks post World War II in a way that does not feel of its time but rather something that can be looked at again even in a modern lense and still be learned from. Every shot in Bicycle Thieves shows the pain and suffering of the working class. It's cinematography is breathtaking as the film uses the camera to truly allow the viewer a look inside of its characters experience in a desperate search for their stolen bicycle that the Riccis need to make a living.",

Bicycle Thief is probably the best report on the hardship and despair that Europeans, in this case Italians, went through after all death and destruction caused by the WWII. The grainy black and white photography is heartbreaking and the many amateur actors just adds to the truthiness. It was a big surprise to know that the main part is played by an amateur actor, maybe that is why the film hits its mark so well and comes across so realistically. The big question raised on the film is how far misery, hunger, poverty and inequality will push you apart from honor and dignity. Will the father be able to maintain his honor and role as a inspirational role for his son on such an extreme situation?The film is intense from start to end and it will keep you on edge of your seat through the more intense moments.

            "content": "Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves is the classic motion picture from the Italian neorealism movement in film, better known as Italy's Golden Age. This is a period after World War II where Italian filmmakers would cast non-professional actors and focus on stories of everyday people who struggle economically, face oppression, and the citizens' changing their outlook on life after the war. Other filmmakers from this era include Roberto Rossellini and Federico Fellini. In 1952, Bicycle Thieves topped Sight & Sound's list of the greatest movies ever which was only four years after its theatrical release. The film has influenced several filmmakers like Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Robert Altman, Spike Lee, and Satyajit Ray. The film centers on Antonio Ricci, played magnificently by Lamberto Maggiorani. He is the husband of Maria Ricci (Lianella Carell) and the father of two children. Maria purchases a bicycle for Antonio because it is required for him to have a two-wheeler for his job displaying advertising posters. When at work, a thief steals Antonio's cycle, leading him and his son, Bruno (Enzo Staiola), on a search to find the bicycle. At the end of the film, Antonio is unable to find his bike and endeavors to steal another bicycle but is caught by a crowd of bystanders, making him a bicycle thief. The movie is directed masterfully. All of the actors and actresses give realistic performances that resemble their reality. I love how De Sica made the picture in real locations in Italy, showing the authenticity and brutality of post-World War II Italy. Bicycle Thieves is beautifully-shot by cinematographer Carlo Montuori and has some of the best editing I have ever seen by Eraldo Da Roma. The movie has the famous transitional wipe editing that would be highly influential in films like Seven Samurai and Star Wars.\n Released in 1948, Bicycle Thieves has a more relevant feel than ever before. It is a movie that can relate to people who are striving to find a profession in their economy. Maybe the thief stole Antonio's cycle because he had to use one for his career. It's possible the robber had a bike stolen from another crook, thus creating a cycle of bicycle thieves. Bicycle Thieves has a powerful theme: everyone is giving it their best shot to make a living, and sometimes that can mean bringing out the worst in who they are. Two of my favorite lines from the film are \"There's a cure for everything except death,\" and \"Why should I kill myself worrying when I'll end up just as dead.\"\n After viewing the film, I thought to myself, \"This is the best film I've ever seen, it's a masterpiece.\" This movie will be watched by both film fans and filmmakers for the rest of history.\nA+",

He even hangs a picture that symbolizes the absolute opposite of the misery surrounding him. Rita Hayworth from GILDA is on the walls all over the city, a sign of joy to some, a representation of their own lowly status to others.When the bicycle is actually stolen, the \"title\" character is sought after by Maggiorani and his young son (Enzo Staiola), a little kid with so much acting ability, you swear this must be a documentary. A grueling search throughout Rome has the essential parts of the movie, because we see up close the actual people and places the neo-realist film movement came to represent. It is a small, sad world they live in and the bike has to be found so that they can live. The father is put to the ultimate test in front of his son.

It's about a man named Ricci, who just got a job in a post-War unemployment-stricken Roma. The community's hopelessness weakened its fraternal spirit as illustrated by these human queues protesting when only one's got a job. And that day seems to be Ricci's day : he will start working as a hanger-poster, all he needs is a bicycle. Having just pawned his, Ricci's reaction quickly betrays him, but from the crowd's opportunistic cries, he realizes he'd better shut his mouth and do the best to get his bicycle back.

In a church, Ricci 'harasses' the only man he previously flashed with the stealer, unluckily frail and old. After a long unsuccessful search, Ricci almost wisely resigns and takes Bruno to the restaurant. For a brief moment, Ricci smiles again and lets Bruno drink a few wine. The restaurant scene represents a pivotal moment when Bruno realizes his personal contrast with the richer kid who can eat spaghetti, and Ricci reconsiders with a mathematical precision how providential and indispensable were the job and the bicycle.Ricci's only chance is superstition, an euphemism for luck. \"Find it now, or it'll be lost forever\" the Wise Woman implacably says. And in an unpredictable twist, Ricci meets the thief, right after the visit and he's the one, as his defensive reaction shows. Ricci violently gets him off a brothel, with the fierceness of a man who won't let his prey escape. De Sica's direction is masterful as it makes Ricci, following the tragic irony that governed his journey, look like a bully to the people of the neighborhood and the epileptic stroke of the suspected kid made Ricci even more detestable.",

            "content": "At the end of the Second World War, Italy was a traumatised country wracked by poverty and political turmoil, and Italian filmmakers responded to these conditions by inventing a new and vital style of filmmaking and that was known as Neorealism. It involved the use of non-professional actors in real-life locations, documentary footage and the result was remarkable because the pain and emotions conveyed were so real.The Bicycle Thief, a 1948 Italian drama film directed by Vittorio De Sica is a milestone of post-war cinema set in Italy where poverty is a dire reality for a large portion of the population. Work is scarce, and the opportunities for employment is few and far between. It is a remarkable cinema a sublimely understated yet rivetingly moving account of a young man's battle against poverty.\"The Bicycle Thief\" is about an economically distraught man \"Antonio Ricci\" (Lamberto Maggiorani) who hunts the job lines day after day to provide for his wife and two children, but suddenly his name is called for a well-paying city job. The only catch is that he needs a bicycle for the job, and he has just pawned his bicycle to feed his family. Thus begins 'The Bicycle Thief', Vittorio de Sica's gritty study in realism. Ricci and his wife sells their bedsheets to get the bicycle back, only to have the bicycle stolen on his first day at the job and when they go to the police for help, they ignore him believing the bicycle is not as important as it is. Thus the father and his young son take it upon themselves to look all over town to try and find the bicycle to keep the job. Ricci and his young son walk around Rome, desperate to find the thief, and more importantly, the bicycle before his next day of work.\nThe city Rome also plays a significant role in this film, not the picture-postcard tourist Rome, but a harsh, strange, unsettling place. One of the things Neorealism does and De Sica is brilliant at, is he takes you on a tour of this city and shows in a very simple theme how the society works, for example when Ricci went to the police station for help after his bike was stolen they simply ignored him. The society seems organised almost as a conspiracy to strip its members and particularly its poorest citizens of their very dignity.The story that the \"Bicycle Thieves\" tells is simple and is one that connects to a lot of people. The story depicts the day to day struggles and the hardship faced by people to make ends meet and survive. The Bicycle Thief' has been a critical favorite for decades for a good reason. It is a must-see film for any cinephile.",

The bicycle appears to be a sign that the curse has been lifted. Well, that actually isn't the case because the very first day on the job the bicycle gets stolen. As he is searching for his bike, he turns to the government (the police) to help him, and it does no good. He also turns to religion (a seer) to help him, and that also does no good. Ricci hits rock bottom and think that his only option is to steal someone else's bicycle. He is that desperate. What choice does he have? His only choice is to take matters into his own hands and the only option that seems possible at the time is to steal someone else's bike. Everything in this movie was very well done. The acting was great. I really liked the little boy who played Ricci's son. The music was very subtle but set the tone for the movie and helped the movie to flow very nicely. It seems to me that the theme of this movie was \"things are bad, but they could be a whole lot worse\". It also was good at expressing the difficulty of living in poverty.",

            "content": "If there ever was that ONE movie that you had to watch, it undoubtedly has to be this.'Bicycle Thieves' or 'The Bicycle Thief' has a rather simple plot outline, with the protagonist's bicycle stolen on the first day of work. He absolutely needs this bicycle to continue working on his new job, and this leads him to start looking for it all over on the streets of Rome. There is hope all over the film. Hope of finding the bicycle each time he attempts in pursuing one lead or the other.The main essence of this film is relationships. Firstly, it's between the father and mother. The mother is shown to be a delicate young woman, who loves her husband, and is excited when her husband finds a new job. There are scenes in this film which have been shot so well, that you can actually feel this strong bond between the two. Secondly, and shown with more significance, is the relationship between the father and his young 7-8 year old son. There are powerful, heart-wrenching and beautiful scenes all over the movie that are shared by them both. There is not a chance that you would miss them. This film has several themes: Hope, a parent's love and concern, an indifferent world, poverty ...The director, De Sica, was a genius to have hired a totally unprofessional cast to act in this film. The actors played their roles to perfection, even the expressions made by the young son were exactly what was needed to make this film just PERFECT.And which is why I say - Everyone needs to watch this piece of art!",

Italian men and women of the difficulties experienced at that time, I saw the beauty of the living conditions of women and found that the Italians in Italy.I think, it is a very good director Vittorio De Sica. The director who seems to understand differently interpret five different screenwriter and shooting scenes in the film shows us the back streets of Italy.Do you know? we can be write to bring into the street culture scenarios, the director has supported scenario and scenes.",
