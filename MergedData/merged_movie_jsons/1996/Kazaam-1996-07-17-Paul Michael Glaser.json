            "content": "Shaquille O'Neal delivers an Oscar worthy performance in what might be the most powerful performance of the 90's. All around, it is brilliant. This is a gripping and amazing tale about a genie and his friendship with a lonely child. Acting is purely amazing and the story is beautifully played out like poetry in motion. Honestly, this film goes down as one of the all time greats. Top to bottom, this film is perfectly mastered. Every actor in this film comes through and nails the role perfectly. 11/10Now, imagine the exact opposite of that. Got it? Okay, the truth is...the movie isn't even *that* good. Shaq, what were you thinking?",

            "content": "This movie really helped me find myself. Before I saw this movie, I wandered this streets crying often knowing my life had no purpose. Until one faithful day, I found myself in Chuckey Cheese on my usual drinking binge. When to my surprise, the robotic Chucky Cheese and gang started singing \"Happy Birthday\" which sounds exactly like \"You're the Best\" (a song from Karate Kid) after an eleven day drink binge. I saw a bright light, which many witnesses argue was a fire cause from the bad wiring in the Chucky Cheese band, pointing at the prize shelf. I took the remaining money I found on a passed out man outside the Chucky Cheese and went to play the Wack-A-Mole game that changed my life. I furiously pounded the moles while I was in the middle of the Chucky Cheese. The children screamed and cried as I fulfilled my destiny; if I could see those children again, I would hug them, for I would not have been able to win those two magical tickets. I went over to thank Chucky which soon after I blacked out, passing out on stage I woke up a few days later in my one room apartment with the tape super-glued to my face. In my excitement I quickly tore it from my skin and shoved it into my VCR. The next hour and thirty-six minutes (I got the special edition) of my life would be the happiest any man could ask for. I was so blown away by the amazing special effects that I was overcame and called an ambulance to pick me up after the movie ended. Shaq play a stunning and realistic role as a rapping Genie. I often found myself dancing in room to his tunes while my neighbor was yelling hurtful words and threats through the wall. After awhile though, I passed out on my floor. Awaking from another blackout, I caught glimpses of Shaq giving candy to all the children. I laughed, I cried. Could this movie be as brilliant as I realized. The ambulance pulled up and I told the paramedics to grab my belly; I was immediately tared. After a few weeks in intensive care, I returned to my house how I left it. Kazaam has given me a new out look on life and hopefully it will help shape your views.",

I'm still trying to get back the couple hours I wasted on it.Let me leave it simply with - Shaq has NO BUSINESS being an actor or singer. He is utterly without talent at both discplines.  It's a crying shame that substantially more talented people waste away in community theatres and karaoke bars while Shaq uses his name as a basketball player to undeservedly get cast in movies and cut CDs.Much of the failure of this movie was the pathetic no-talent that is Shaq.",

A kid got a lot of imagination and a good sense of fun. So while this movie is corny and silly from an adults perspective these were exactly the things I loved as a kid.A giant rapping genie, a fun friendship, family, the struggle of a kid growing up in the city and a ridiculous music business villain.

Good thing I got half a bottle of wine left. So, yeah, Kazaam was amazing. Shaq was a genie. Who better to play the part? No one, that's who. Yizzeah. So, anyway, Max lives in Compton and is sick of getting shot at so he hires this basketball player to be his genie. Said basketball player is terrible at free-throws. Anyway, this guy is always..like..turning crap into something else and making some other crap fall from the sky. Then he (and the Miami Heat) beat the Washington Wizards 105-86 in the opening game of their Eastern-Conference-semifinals playoff series, but then he lost to Steve Nash in the MVP voting.

The movie starts out a little shaky but it gets better. The acting in the movie is kinda bad and the plots are very predictable but it was still okay. I'll admit that Shaq's acting is bad and he should stick to rapping and the NBA, the other characters acting weren't that awful.The movie has a nice fell to it while watching, the scenes and designs are cool. One of my favorite parts in the movie is when Max is talking to Kazaam and Kazaam tells him that he has 3 wishes, so Max wishes that it would rain burgers and fries. That part was funny and cool. I also liked the ending in the movie.Id recommend this movie",

            "content": "I remember watching this film as a semi-retarded adolescent and not enjoying it due to the vague underlying themes that flew over my head at such a young age. However, last week, passing this movie in the Blockbuster Mega-Discount bin, I decided to re-watch it and see if my opinion has changed.(I tried to keep this review as spoiler free as possible, without losing some of the movie's flair. I feel I have succeeded) I must say, spending that 2.50$ plus tax was the greatest decision of my pitiful and shameful life. In the 5 days I have had the VHS, I have watched this film at least 15 times, I unfortunately lost track after blacking out naked on my carpet on the 2nd day. This movie goes down in history as one of the 5 greatest drama sequels of all time, and If I had to put a rating on it's comedy factor, I would give it 4 thumbs way up. I found myself laughing throughout the entire film, calling my friends and family to repeat jokes I had heard. The casting in this film is absolutely excellent, with Shaq leading the performance like a Frenchman in a yogurt factory. The story revolves around a genie named Shaq, and a small Italian boy named Max. Upon finding a magic stereo player, Max discovers a small black genie living inside, and offers to give him a place to sleep and eat for a week. Ironically, this is where the theme of pedophilia comes into play, with multiple scenes of Max and Shaq showering together and close up shots of them smiling. I hate to repeat myself, but as a child, I understood nothing about this subject. However, as a fleshy man, I see it in a new and blinding light.There are several moments throughout the play where the development of the characters and storyline drag, but the rest of the film certainly make up for it. The end is griping, and keeps me on the edge of my seat every time I watch it. At the same time, I cry when the credits roll and long to see Shaq's black face one more time (of course, I will rewind the movie at this point and watch it over again).On a final note, this movie is almost perfect in every aspect. This is the epitome of what a Hollywood blockbuster should be. The casting is amazing, the special effects are mind-blowingly realistic and stunning, the fully orchestrated soundtrack fits the mood perfectly and amplifies the experience. If I were to put a grade on this, I would have to give it a 9/10, losing a point because of the slight nudity (i'm not the biggest fan, but I won't say no!). But, this is not a movie to be rated, it is a movie to be bought, watched, and enjoyed. Do yourself a big favor and buy this movie, your taste buds will thank you.",

Genius!) There is one scene that I love so much. It's the scene (in a warehouse, I believe) where Max's first wish to Kazaam was that he wished that he could have junk food \"from here to the sky!\" Well, he got his wish - an icky burger had fallen to the ground! Max said to Kazaam, \"That's it?\" And suddenly, the whole place was raining candy bars, PowerBars (at least that's what they look like in fast mode), M&Ms (you can see the bags after it stops raining), the works! That got me laughing! You all must see \"Kazaam\" for yourselves and suddenly, y'all will indulge in junk food the next time y'all are bored!",

I use to pray for the genie, so I could make it rain candy. The most hilarious part, was it was an illegal copy, and at the bottom of the screen, it would scroll \"This is an illegal copy. If you have bought this from a store, you have broken the law.\" Anyway, as I got older, I saw how stupid the story line is, and how bad the acting is. However, it was part of my childhood, and you can't ignore your childhood. Make fun of me all you want for once liking it, but remember, I was seven at the time.",

OK, this movie is deeply flawed, mild in entertainment, but with all of these rappers and basketball stars (Omarion in \"You Got Served, Darius Miles in \"The Perfect Score) in movies playing rappers and basketball stars, at least Shaq attempts to be a genie,and TRIES to stretch his acting ability by being something he's not.

Granted, there are some funny moments specifically the ones with the flying toasts and the bicycle race. And it is not the worst movie of 1996, Ed and especially Bio Dome are worse. However, the special effects are really quite substandard, and the rest of the production values are of direct to video quality and shoddy ones at that. The story is predictable with only a few worthwhile scenes to favour, the sight gags suffer from poor comic timing and the script is childish and simplistic. The characters I really dislike here, the kid is annoying, the villain is one of the lamest I have seen in a long time while Shaquille O'Neal's Genie with his awful rapping(then again I dislike rap intensely, and that is the least problematic of his performance) grated on me fast. The acting doesn't fare much better either, while the direction is literally non-existent and the soundtrack is only tolerable if on mute. This is of course my opinion, disagree all you want, I guess I just didn't like it. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Yes, Kazaam is one of those horribly bad movies that almost reminds one of everything that is wrong with not just kids movies, but with humanity. Here we have Shaq as a rapping genie- yes, a RAPPING genie- where he does everything from making bad puns to dressing in ridiculous outfits, all ending in him in a Christ-like pose with lots of light surrounding him. So, yeah, expect really cheesy bits, including the first wish being a lot of junk food falling down from the sky (and, regrettably, not knocking out the two main characters, particularly the kid). What might not be expected is that a film with a kid and Shaquille O'Neill would be so incredibly schmaltzy! The main plot of the film involves this kid, played in that all-too-typical and annoying-kid fashion by the great-grandson of Frank Capra (where in which the kid is yelling out his dialog angrily), who comes upon a genie who's been trapped in a boom-box. Then \"hiarity ensues\" as the kid makes the Shaq-genie his quasi-slave as he waits on his last two wishes as he tries to make amends with his shady-gang-type absentee father.This really sappy, contrived son and father story would be bad enough, as there are certain lines that have been uttered in a million other movies (i.e. the \"two chances in life\" speech from father to son). But it's Shaquille O'Neill who is both the reason to watch the film (ironically), and the obvious sinking crux of it all. His plot line involves him, when not getting the over-talky treatment from Capra, to rap within the dialog and also start off his blossoming recording career. On top of this, he also kicks ass and takes names with the main bad guys who want him back in the boom-box. So is there a camp factor to the movie? Up to a point, but this is even squashed by all of the mushy scenes and 'heart-felt' moments that have really no business with the rest of the material. One might ask if the people making the movie, who were obviously doing it at the behest of the popularity of a BASKETBALL player who wanted to go on the Michael Jordan acting bandwagon, if it would be anywhere near decently entertaining or convincing. I'd hope that they too knew they were just getting paid. But I'd hope even more that they felt at least a little guilty afterwords for feeding the Shaq-machine.So, if you want to have a fun night of Shaq as genie-turned-rapper-turned-wisecracker, all the more fun to you. Hell, it might even be interesting to have a Shaq movie night with this and his other critically acclaimed effort Steel. But if you're hoping to keep a few brain cells, stay away from what is very likely the worst flick of 1996, and a candidate among many others for worst of the 90's.",

A rapping genie who knows kung fu and lives in a boom box played by none other than Shaquille O'Neal, what more could you want in a comedy?! I mean sure some of it was cringe worthy and it's not exactly Oscar material, but overall it was a great laugh. Anyone who wants to dis this movie needs to lighten up a little.

            "review_title": "Reel Look: Kazaam",
            "content": "\"Let's green egg and ham it.\" I was only seven years old when Kazaam was released into theaters, starring Shaquille O'Neal as the eponymous enchanter. And to this day I am truly grateful that my parents never took me to see this magical mishap of a motion picture two decades later. Back in the 90s when Shaq was at the height (no pun intended) of his professional career with the NBA, Los Angels Lakers and doing several Reebok or Pepsi commercials, his film appearances, especially as a main character, proved to be disastrous. The tag line on the VHS and DVD cover or what have you reads: \"He's a rappin' genie-with-an-attitude...and he's ready for slam-dunk fun!\" I as the viewer greatly disapproved. Even the Los Angeles Daily News didn't know what to say, so they just slapped \"FUN!\" on the cover in big capitalized yellow letters. Nonetheless, I would taken away the 'N'. With a budget of $20 million, only earning back $18.9 million in return, it also obtained a six percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on thirty-three reviews, and a twenty-four out of one hundred on Metacritic. So why did this family fantasy flop so hard? Let's take a look.The film promptly opens on a swinging wrecking ball knocking down a dilapidated building in New York City; a perfect metaphor. A final swing knocks Kazaam's lamp in slow motion onto a boombox that just happens to be there as we hear him screaming. And how fitting to see director Paul M. Glaser's (David Starsky from the Starsky & Hutch TV show) name appearing over the sound of breaking pottery. That sound effect alone sums up the rest of the movie indefinitely. We then meet Max Connor (Francis Capra), a twelve-year-old kid on the run from a local gang of bullies, who chase him into the said building being demolished. Max accidentally kicks the boombox and unknowingly awakens the 5,000 year-old genie just as the bullies find him. Kazaam scares them away with his so-called rapping. Max later goes home to Alice (Ally Walker). She is a single Mom of whom she and her son don't exactly see eye to eye, especially since she's seeing a fireman named Travis (John Costelloe, of whom was an actual FDNY firefighter in real life and played Jim \"Johnny Cakes\" Witowski on The Sopranos). Kazaam later explains to the troubled youth, of whom at first wants nothing to do with him, that he can grant him three wishes. From telling Max that he doesn't \"believe in fairy tales\" to even taking a shower in front of Max in his own bedroom singing an almost unrecognizable rendition of Stayin' Alive...its just a mess.Eventually the tough Max warms up to Kazaam and starts to believe what he says when he causes mountains of junk food to rain down from the heavens. He also realizes that he owns the towering turban-wearing thaumaturge until he makes his last two wishes. Of course what Max really wants is to get to know his estranged father (James Acheson), of whom left him when he was two. He sets out to find him, only to discover that he is a musical talent producer of which the cause of his success is specializing in unauthorized music. Kazaam forgets about Max once the boy's father takes a liking to him as a new possible rap talent as he tries his hand at a music career at his nightclub. But the sleazy villainous club owner Malik (Marshell Manesh), wants Kazaam for his own, and it is only the final wish, from the heart, that Max wishes that his Dad would be given a second chance at life as Kazaam personally deals with the Malik and his cronies. Hereafter, Max then accepts Travis as a new father figure.Kazaam is really one of those good/bad movies that emerged in the 90s. It was good because it was and still is a fairly harmless family film, but bad because it has over time gained attention since its release for its absurd concept and Shaquille O'Neal's performance, making it a critical and financial failure. It also caused Paul M. Glaser to never direct another film since due to negative reviews on his work. Roger Ebert gave the film 1.5 stars, writing: \"Shaq has already proved he can act (in Blue Chips, the 1994 movie about college basketball). Here he shows he can be likable in a children's movie. What he does not show is good judgment in his choice of material. [...] the filmmakers didn't care to extend themselves beyond the obvious commercial possibilities of their first dim idea.\" In a 2012 interview with GQ magazine, O'Neal said, \"I was a medium-level juvenile delinquent from Newark who always dreamed about doing a movie. Someone said, 'Hey, here's $7 million, come in and do this genie movie.' What am I going to say, no? So I did it.\" Though more suited in appearing as a film cameo, Shaq's last leading role would be in the following year as John Henry Irons/Steel in the critically-acclaimed box office bomb 'Steel', nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Actor.If Kazaam is wishful thinking in the power to begin anew, than it should have stayed bottled up and lost for one-thousand and one nights deep beneath the sands of the Arabian desert. The film is innocuous but its demise is that it is solely based on and crafted from a mix of genre clich\u00e9s. Kazaam lacks imaginative stamina and, compared with Shaq's larger-than-life charisma, the film does not know what it wants to be either due to stifled, routine filmmaking and terrible rapping. Nowadays the movie is just a guilty pleasure for millennials to riff or poke fun at. My wish for you is that you never buy or rent Kazaam and see this jolly black giant on your television screen anytime soon.",

            "content": "The other day my girlfriends and I were having our pizza night and looking for movies to watch. Kazaam was on demand and I asked if any the girls had seen it, only one of my friends did and I asked if it really was as bad as everyone says it is. She said she didn't remember since she saw it as a kid so we all decided to go for the bait and see if Kazaam really does deserve one of the worst movies in cinema titles. Oh, yeah, it really does. I could not believe how bad this movie was. Shaq has the acting quality of a wooden shelf, the kid who is supposed to be a hero is actually a brat, the villain of the story looks like a chewed up version of Mario from Super Mario Brothers and the story does not make sense for the child audience it was aimed for. How in the heck is a child supposed to relate to this story of trying to get his pirate music stealing father back with his mother while being stalked by a 7 foot tall grown man offering him free treats and all the presents in the world and OH MY GOD does that not sound so bad?! There are so many things wrong with this movie it drives me insane.A schoolboy named Max is confronted and chased down by a group of bullies through the city of New Bronslin. Max is chased into the abandoned building, where he discovers a magical boom-box and accidentally unleashes the genie inside. The genie, who introduces himself as Kazaam, tells Max that he is now Max's genie. Max returns home to find that his mother is marrying a fireman. It is revealed that his mother lied to him about his real father's whereabouts, and that he is actually located in the city. Max set out to search for his father in the hopes of rekindling some sort of bond between them. He suddenly encounters Kazaam during his travels, who pesters Max into making a wish. Max eventually finds his father, only to learn that he is a musical talent agent who specializes in pirated music. A employee of the nightclub shows interest in Kazaam upon the realization that he is a genie, and hopes to control Kazaam through Max's father.Between the awful acting, the terrible script and the lousy effects, this movie is just plain bad. This is how bad this is, Shaq literally slam dunks the villain to defeat him! If that's not a plug in for his career, I don't know what is. The kid Max has no likable qualities, he has a very loving mother and a possible step father who cares for him, yet he acts like a total jerk because he's not getting his way with not having his dad around who is a criminal no less! Even when his criminal father kicks him out of his life, Max still does everything to save him, sick isn't it? Shaq, I don't know the writers were thinking. Maybe that it's so funny that a giant basketball super star should be a genie and it's a great way to make a quick buck for those sucker parents who's kids are begging to see the film. I don't know how to say this other than just say it, it really is as bad as everyone says it is if not worse. Trust me, don't waste your sanity on this horrible movie, Shaq's acting is enough to make you wish this movie never existed in the first place.1/10",

And then, the film has the mandatory emotionally-controlling segments that have nothing whatsoever to do with the already pointless plot, like the whole divorced father piece. Priceless.

            "content": "Reviewing KAZAAM and saying it's a bad movie isn't hard at all--after all, critics at the time it came out fell all over themselves excoriating this film--saying it was among the worst films of the decade! So the fact that I say it's bad or anyone else says it's bad is certainly no surprise. It's like someone talking about WWII--practically no one says that was a GOOD thing, right?! The question I have and no place on IMDb can answer it is \"why did they make this in the first place?!\". After all, it's obvious to anyone who isn't severely brain injured that the film would be horrible. But, movies like ED (a baseball playing chimp), COOL AS ICE (starring the ever-popular Vanilla Ice), TROLL 2 (which doesn't even have any trolls in it), BABY GENIUSES (Einstain-like superhero babies) and PINOCCHIO IN OUTER SPACE (huh!?!) prove that any idea, no matter how dumb, can make it to the big screen! So, the idea of the best basketball player of the time starring as a genie to an obnoxious little brat seems downright 'normal'! The film starts with a kid who is pretty jerky keying the lockers in the hallway of the school. Like the punk from FREE WILLY, this kid is somehow 'misunderstood' (in other words, a total brat) and you know that no matter how selfish and horrible he is, by the end of the film he'll have learned something and grown. Just once, I want to see a punk kid like this end up in prison or or dead by the end of the film! Eventually, while the neighborhood bullies are in the middle of pummeling him, the genie Kazaam (Shaquille O'Neal)is accidentally released and insists on giving the brat three wishes. But, the kid doesn't believe him AND the genie's magic seems a tad rusty.Eventually the brat does realize that Kazaam is for real. However, unlike most kids, he withholds making his wishes so, in the meantime, Kazaam is forced to follow him around everywhere--like his own personal servant. And, according to the clich\u00e9, you know that by the end of the film, Max and Kazaam will have become lifelong buddies and a bunch of tears will be shed. Oh, and Max will have come to terms with his absent father and mom's fianc\u00e9 (I'm gonna gag). Apparently this genie is a bit of a social worker in addition to being a granter of wishes.As for Kazaam, Shaquille speaks in rhyme through much of the movie and even takes a break to rap...very poorly. I'm a middle-aged white guy and I think I could probably rap at least as well! He's an amazing basketball player and I've heard he's a nice guy--but a rapper...no way! As far as his acting goes, he wasn't great but had such a nice personality in the film that it's hard to hate him--even if they made him do a lot of very stupid things.So is the movie as excruciatingly awful as you've probably heard? through the first two-thirds of the movie, I would have said no. Shaquille seemed to try his best with an unlikable kid and a bad script. However, later in the film, the bad becomes horrid--as Kazaam seems too concerned with himself to help the kid when he's really needed. And, out of nowhere, the plot gets really, really weird--as the guy who wants to make Kazaam a rap star(?!?!) turns out to be an evil mobster! And, oddly, this guy seems to accept that Kazaam is a genie with no hesitation! In addition, the last portion of the film consists of people trying to kill Max and his dad. I know that the kid was annoying, but this is supposed to be a kids' film!! What part of 'trying to kill the kid' didn't the writers not understand?!? Then, in an ending that makes this perhaps the worst kids film ending in history, Kazaam becomes god or something and it all was like a drug-induced hallucination! This ending was even dumber and weirder than the one in THE BLACK HOLE...and boy, did it make my brain hurt!! Uggghh--the horrible dialog was just too much to bear!!!Overall, it's a terrible film that is due mostly to writers who were certifiably insane. Yes, folks, with a messed up message, bizarre non-kid friendly material and horrible characters, this is one wretched film. Sadly, given the idea and actors, it's hard to imagine the final product turning out much worse!!By the way, if you want to see a Genie in a modern world film that is GOOD, try the British made for TV film \"Bernard and the Genie\"--a charming and exceptionally well-written film from start to finish.",

He falls through an upper floor and onto the stereo releasing Kazaam. Shaq pops out, starts rapping terribly for some reason and continually pesters Max about taking his wishes.Kazaam and our little smart-mouth, (because the world can't get enough movies with back-chatting brats), set about locating and reuniting with his real father. I got so far as Kazaam following Max to a nightclub. Kazaam with his genie stereo strapped around his waist starts rapping along with the obligatory half-naked black women, all lazily rapping and repeatedly pointing at the audience. Again it's the 90s. Max's father is an unscrupulous music producer or some such and wants nothing to do with his son. The nightclub owner somehow realises Kazaam is a rapping genie and wants to sign him, and therefore control him. The next morning, Kazaam ends up in Max's bedroom singing off key in a one man personal shower with an oversized loofah and at that moment I called it quits.Who the hell writes and funds this junk?

Ally Walker is wasted as Capra's mother who is discouraged with regards to his father but loves her son, etc. His father is one of these guys who just doesn't know any better. Marshall Manesh plays a nightclub owner who shows interest in Kazaam as oppose to a superior script. The only area of compliment are perhaps the special effects, otherwise the film serves only as a showcase for O'Neal in a bunch of stupid action sequences and looking foolish in the process. This film should be kazammed into a campfire to see if it burns into something magical. Score: 1 / 10",

No wonder it's on IMDb's Bottom 100 list.I'll start off with the good parts: It did have some funny moments like the scene with the flying french toasts and the scene where Max and Kazaam are having a bicycle race.The bad parts: Everything else in this movie was boring and bad.Shaq as a genie is just plain awful. Beside's he can't even rap. In one scene, he's singing, \"Let's Green Eggs and Ham it\". Seriously? That's kinda like a 5-year old doing a rap song.The other character's weren't even that good. Max is annoying. The villain is not even that evil. Literally.Also, wasn't this suppose to be a family film? In one scene, Max say's, \"So after my 2 last wishes, I own you?\", then Kazaam say's, \"Technically\". Is it me, or is this film about slavery?Overall, \"Kazaam\", is an awful movie that's not even worth watching. But compare it to, \"Batman and Robin\", \"Son of the Mask\", or \"Battlefield Earth\", it's not that bad. So if you're looking for a good movie with a Genie in it, watch the Disney movie, \"Aladdin\". That film has a Genie that can sing and make you laugh. He is also voiced by Robin Williams. A \"GOOD\" actor.",

When the genie, who considers trying his hand at a music career, forgets about his young master, Max is attacked by villainous club owner Malik..........Shaq had a couple of years in the nineties where the marketing bods saw something I the brand that was Shaq. First there was his silly game, Shaq-Fu, which was a Mortal Kombat rip off, then there was his illustrious music career, which in turn gave him the chance not only to star, but to executive produce his two 'big' movies.Steel came after this, and is decidedly better than this, but there is something really weird about Kazaam, it's bad, sometimes hilariously bad, but the studio must have had a little faith in the film, being released in the summer, just a couple of weeks after Independence Day.So Max finds Shaq, hates his mother and step dad to be, finds his real dad, who hates him, and in turn, influences Shaq to hate everybody via the power of rap, and his magical boom box.The first wish Max should have asked for was to repair that distracting crooked tooth to be corrected, and to get some manners, because Max has to be one of the most unbearable child characters I've seen in a while. He's abhorrent to his mother, who appears to be in a totally different film, and he looks up to a man who wouldn't give him the time of day.Shaq cannot act for a toffee, here it seems that he was just trying to showcase his rappin' talents and hope that the two combined would catapult him to the big time.It didn't,And the fact that Max falls the equivalent of the Chrysler building through the film begs the question, is all this happening in his subconscious?

Or any movie.Kazaam could possibly be one of the worst movies ever made. Terrible and mixed messages, bad dialogue, cinematography and editing from a blind person, horrible and uncharismatic characters \u2013 so no one to root for, inconsistences in an incoherent script, sickening special effects and probably the most horrifying raps any human spoke/sang are just some of the problems. But, I'm sure with the many more issues I didn't list, this film could be taught in college on how not to make a movie. This all-over-the-place mess didn't even try. Sometimes I just feel sorry for bad filmmakers who had a vision and at least tried. There was no attempt here but some to cash a check that probably bounced anyways.Not much of a plot, but a bullied and unlikable kid releases a boom-box genie in an abandoned building that was in the process of being demolished, but the filmmakers forgot to finish that idea. Kazaam, a bland genie, just wants to grant three wishes to the delinquent so he could be imprisoned again, I guess. All that is followed by no less than six other subplots, none of worth repeating, remembering or writing about.Again, there's so many things wrong with this \"family-friendly\" kid movie, but probably the most despicable is how creepy the adult Kazaam acts around his \"master,\" the 12-year-old boy. He stalks him, ends up in bed with him and even kisses him\u0085on the mouth, no less. I don't care that this came out 20 years ago, none of this should've ever been seen as anything but a recruiting video for pedophiles. It's not so bad it's good, it's so bad\u0085it's unforgivable. ***Final thoughts: Granted, I just watched a ton of artsy Oscar-bait movies to catch up on the 2015 nominated movies, so I wanted a little dumb movie action. Additionally, I needed to see this this for the fantastic How Did This Get Made? podcast that covered it. Maybe I did get my wish: I really got something INCREDIBLY dumb.

I could not figure out how anyone thought that casting basketball great Shaquille O'Neal as a genie was a good idea. How in the world do you convince anyone to spend millions of dollars on this concept? I could argue that it's an ad for Shaq as a product but the movie showcases none of the charm and talent that have made him a star athlete. So what's the point? The pathetic stab at a story involves a lonely kid who finds a boom box in the wreckage of an old building. Suddenly out pops a 5,000-year-old genie that grants him three wishes. Therein lies the first question \u2013 How could a 5,000 year old genie live in an object that has probably been around only about 10 years? Kazaam gives the kid a mountain of candy that falls from the sky and therein lies the second question \u2013 How does he know what candy is and how does he know how to materialize them in wrappers that he has never seen? I also put this question to the mountain bike that he presents to the kid. Kazaam's boom box was found the wreckage of a building. Somehow I feel like I've given more thought to this script then they did.As for the kid, he's played by Francis Capra, a young actor the I liked in Robert De Niro's 'A Bronx Tale' a few years back. In that film he was likable, bright and always seemed to be listening when the other actors were speaking to him, not just waiting for his cue. Here that's all gone, he's bored and never seems to be trying. It's kind of like watching Maculay Culkin in his worst films.'Kazaam' is tired. I'm not just talking about the script or idiotic idea of casting Shaquille O'Neal as a genie but I mean this movie is paced so lethargically that it made me tired just watching it do nothing. This is what I call a 'door movie', because the filmmakers don't care what you see on screen because after you've paid the admission and gone through the door, their job is basically done.",

This movie is a lot about his rapping and the catchy rhymes make it all worth-while. I recommend it to any Shaq fan who is up for a laugh. It is also a great movie for little kids as it actually does teach a lesson. I thought Shaq did alright acting.

The other two films from the list that I've seen so far were immensely boring because nothing ever happened in them. This one at least had some action in it but every single thing that happened was just stupid. Now, I can enjoy stupid movies; films that are so bad they become funny, this one though was painfully unfunny. On top of that, the film is in the mid 90's and the film makers make that abundantly clear with the way people dress and above all the horrible hip hop music playing throughout the film. It reminds me of all the bad things about the 90's and none of the good ones. By far the worst thing though is Kazaam himself who, despite being thousands of years old is hip, but not in a good way, and goes around rhyming every sentence he utters like some kind of idiotic hip hop artist. That Shaq can't rap doesn't exactly make it any better.This whole thing feels like a bad 90's music video - starring an untalented rapper - drawn out to a full length feature.",

            "review_title": "\"I am an Idiot for starring in this movie\" - Kazaam",
            "content": "Kazaam\" is a massive failure on so many levels that showcases a production company's desire to take advantage of children and is a backdoor way for Shaq to promote a rap career. This movie fails with everything it sets out to accomplish. Shaq as a genie didn't even make me laugh as much as it made me feel uncomfortable every time I saw that stupid smile of his staring at the kid. This film sucked, so let's get this over with so nobody has to view it.It's about a kid, Max (Francis Capra), who lives with his mother, Alice (Ally Walker), in Brooklyn, New York. During school, Max is chased by bullies into an abandoned building where he falls through the floor and discovers a boom box. He accidentally unleashes the Genie inside, who calls himself, \"Kazaam\" (Shaq) who likes to rap. Kazaam becomes Max's Genie and follows him around until Max's three wishes are granted. Max discovers that his mother lied to him about his father, Nick (James Acheson), who left the family years before. Max discovers his dad is in New York, so he sets out to find him while hauling Kazaam behind him.There's only one reason this got made, and Shaq rapping throughout the movie shows why. He is not only creepy throughout the film, but there's not even any potential for it to be good at all. I don't think any intention to make a good movie was here, and all I can think of is that Shaq was desperate to be an actor, nope, or a rapper. It's also supposed to be a kid's movie, and I have a lot of issues with that. I strongly disagree with that as its quite a violent film, but I will get to that. So, it starts with a massive wrecking ball taking up five mins of the movie's opening to destroy a building that houses a magic lamp that Kazaam is inside. The thing tips over and lands on a boom box. The Genie decides to take up residence inside.We get introduced to Max, who tries hard to be a bad boy and gets bullied by some stupid kids who try even harder to be bad boys. It's like the director told the kids to look like wannabe drug-dealing thugs because that what they come off as. These kids are supposed to be high school students, but they are so mean-spirited, and one of them wears an earring bigger than my fist. It adds a seriously violent tone to the film as they beat Max up for no reason. I can't even begin to believe they are bullies. There is a sequence in a bathroom where they outline his body on the floor with paint. I think I'll stick with the director telling them to be drug dealers because I don't believe they are in high school. Why do we need to show \"Bullies\" painting a teenager's body on the floor?The kids are scared off when Kazaam appears, starts rapping, and one of them decides to try to hit the Genie with a piece of wood. Does that sound like something someone would do if a Genie, oh I don't know, popped out of nowhere and looked like Shaq dressed like a ridiculous clown? Shaq looks like a TV commercial for the middle east as he walks around with the kid at 7 foot 6 and smiles like an idiot whenever he stares at the kid. From here on, we learn that Max's equally stupid father pirates music and gets involved with some of the most laughable actors I have ever seen in a film. These guys are truly pathetic. One of them, I think he is the main villain, speaks with a fake Russian accent and can't act at all. It all leads up to a violent ending involving Max and an elevator shaft. Shaq kung-fu fights a group of terribly acted Russian gangsters. They want to learn Kazaam's power or something. At this point in the film, I just wanted it to end.Nobody in this film can act. The direction gets thrown out the window, and the screenplay is such a mess that they need to fill time in so Kazaam shows Max his powers by using horrible special effects to make it rain candy bars. The special effects are so adverse they will hurt your eyes. One of the creepier scenes is when Kazaam wakes up in the kid's bed, and than he uses horrible special effects to show in front of the kid singing a stupid song. I think Shaq was a rapper around this time, which would explain why there is a dumb subplot where some moron sees Kazaam rap and hires him to open for the female hip hop trio Salt-N-Pepa. The story takes a complete detour and forgets everything so they can showcase Shaq as a rapper until the end of the film comes along, which becomes quite violent with the main villain getting turned into a CGI ball and dunked.This movie should never have got made. Too many bad ideas fused to form a choppy film that attempts to showcase Shaq in many different ways that fail, his outfit is the silliest of them all. The ending is pretty severe for a children's movie. After he beats up the gangsters, the kid Max had been thrown down an elevator shaft early and is dead. Shaq uses his powers to become \"SuperShaqFu,\" I guess, and the kid gets resurrected because of a speech. I hope parents don't take their kids to see this awful film, and the people who made it should be ashamed of themselves for taking advantage of Children.\n1/10",

Watching Kazaam taught me that there's nothing nuanced about how terrible this movie is. You heard it was bad. I heard it was bad. We can now agree that there's nothing clouding our judgment.This movie reeks of the decade it was made in. Physically-incapable-of-acting basketball star Shaq is the title character, a genie that lives in a boombox. The protagonist of the movie is Max, a bratty kid that finds Kazaam in an abandoned building. We're supposed to sympathize with Max because he's bullied, but he's such a little jerk that it's actually cathartic to watch him get bullied. Kazaam and Max make an unlikely pair, not just because a 7 foot tall black man follows a little white boy around New York like a lost puppy, but also because Kazaam wants to go through the three wishes to gain his freedom (and hopefully get far, far away from this kid), and Max, in a completely realistic and tightly written portrayal of the selfish child that he is, decides that he doesn't want to use any of the magic wishes his genie is begging him to make. The \"plot\" of the film revolves around Max learning that his mother lied to him all these years and that his father actually lives in the city, so he goes off to see his father for the first time in however many years (Kazaam is along for the ride). He's crushed to find out that his dad is a total sleazebag (like father like son) music executive and eventually it's up to Kazaam to use his miraculous powers not to end poverty, war or world hunger but to mend this broken white family. There's another sleazebag that figures out Kazaam is a genie and plots to steal him out from under Max.If you found Shaq's non-acting to be distressing, prepare yourself for the \ntrauma that is his rapping. This movie fails in just about every conceivable \nway. A story about a kid and his genie should be pretty straightforward but \nsomehow, most of the characters are unlikable, the plot is dull and \npredictable, and I'll sound like a broken record if I keep talking about the \nacting.

Shaq's just not an actor, he's a physical specimen, he's a monster basketball player who you don't want to play against, but acting isn't his thing and if that was his real rapping, then that also is really bad. He actually said, \"Let's Green Egg and Ham it.\" Anyways, the plot is that Shaq's a rapping genie who gets let out of his radio type lamp and gives Max three wishes and Shaq \"raps\" (or as i call it, doing bad poetry) almost everything he says. If you like Shaq and just want to see his presence or are curious to see his very short rap career, then, watch the movie. i, however, didn't love it, but again, it wasn't the worst I've seen.",

            "content": "We would really like to give this movie a full, detailed review, but unfortunately we periodically left the room for no reason at all just to get away from this brutal disgrace of a movie.  First of all, this movie appeared to have a large budget, yet the director clearly forgot to address Max's snaggle tooth.  With all the special effects in this movie, they could've at least made this kid look like he kept a dentist appointment. Now, let's move on to the major flaw of this movie--Shaq.  It appears that this guy can do it all--play basketball, rap, and act.  However, these last two things are severely lacking.  His raps consist of such memorable lines as, \"I'll be the cream for your coffee,\" \"I'll green eggs and ham it,\" and \"fresh out the box like a premature burial.\"  This rap song was awful....it was right up there with his breakthrough flops \"I'm Outstanding\" and \"Biological Didn't Bother.\"  Possibly the worst scene of the movie was the recycled after-school special speech by the soon-to-be step-father, Travis. We cringed when we heard Travis reassure Max that he would not take the place of his father.  There were a lot of unnecessary scenes with Max's father that we left the room for.  However, when we returned we caught the tail-end of some poorly acted \"bad-guy\" scenes.  This movie was plagued with weak walk-on parts, such as 'Da Brat and Spinderella. We found it very preposterous how Shaq became a pop music icon after \"rapping\" one stinkin' song in a dingy club.  We also found the recycled \"school is cool\" message to be extremely played.  In particular where Shaq plays Max's tutor (a job that seemed extremely far-fetched for Shaq).  In this movie, Shaq claims that he is more intelligent than a Harvard grad.  Once again, this is just stupid.  In reality, Shaq has the equivalent of a 5th grade education, as evidenced by his stammering as he struggles through the cue cards. Overall, this movie is unbearable and painful to watch.  Shaq should really look into other hobbies in the off-season, and Francis Capra should receive dental assistance before even thinking about going to another audition.",

However, the special effects are really quite substandard, and the rest of the production values are of direct to video quality and shoddy ones at that. The story is predictable with only a few worthwhile scenes to favour, the sight gags suffer from poor comic timing and the script is childish and simplistic. The characters I really dislike here, the kid is annoying, the villain is one of the lamest I have seen in a long time while Shaquille O'Neal's Genie with his awful rapping(then again I dislike rap intensely, and that is the least problematic of his performance) grated on me fast. The acting doesn't fare much better either, while the direction is literally non-existent and the soundtrack is only tolerable if on mute.

I think the writing is the biggest problem in this film, the audience can't connect with the characters as they are all introduced as self-serving and stuck up. The only character in the movie I felt for was Max's mother, played by Ally Walker. About halfway through the film, the movie seemed to become a cheap attempt to further Shaq's rap career, but he isn't a good rapper and none of the musicians he performs with are really any good either.

The parents I don\u2019t have much sympathy for either. Both sides show that they are flawed characters. There is also not much time we see them with their parents before they leave the parents out of the scene. Their is not enough back story provided concerning why the parents got separated. The bad guys and the gangs are not well developed either. This film has funny scenes such as the French toast flying around. Kazaam taking a shower but no water touching the floor. The film works best when Kazaam & Max are paired up. But there is not enough time to get invested in the other characters to care which side to stand for or against. This has so early visual effects which look cartoony rather than real such as Kazaam with magic sparks coming out flying around the room that looked false.

Someone should have let the guy know that's not how life works. And oh, by the way, you have the acting abilities of a tree stump. The inimitable yet often misunderstood \"Shaq\" stars in this film travesty as a genie who gives a picked-on boy three wishes. Well my three wishes are: 1) That the United Nations bans Shaq from ever stepping in front of a camera anywhere on Earth ever again, 2) That every athletic contract include a clause preventing athletes from pursuing film careers, and 3) That Lena gets a lifetime Grammy, it's long overdue. And so you're producing \"Kazaam\" and you get a giant acting novice to star, so who do you hire to direct, to help bring forth what you hope will be a good performance from this lumbering jackass? Starsky! F*cking Starsky! Yes, '70s TV icon Paul Michael Glaser directs. And just to top things off, they throw in a cameo by boyband the Backdoor Boys...er, I mean the Backstreet Boys. So that's supposed to be the recipe for a smash hit film: a jock who can't act, a '70s TV reject, and a talentless '90s 'N Sync ripoff. Okaaaaaaaay. Needless to say, I cannot recommend this film, not even to watch as a joke just to see how bad a movie can be. If you want to do that, watch \"Beaches.\"",

Besides, anything with Francis Capra can't be all bad, just look at his work on Veronica Mars! Capra was a really cute kid and I found my own son could relate to him as he came across warm and accessible. As For O'Neal, this is a similar role as he played in Steel. If you saw one movie, you saw his style in the other. There is a reason Basketball pay him so much and he'll follow yo that career with one in Law Enforcement, but if you need a big friendly guy for a fantasy movie, he will be your ticket.",

Well for one, if this was supposed to be an entertaining and fun family film, it definitely doesn't do that. Kazaam is a stupid, pointless, poorly constructed piece of garbage that should never have been made in the first place. This is a film that no one should waste their time on. Director Paul Michael Glaser should be ashamed of himself for directing this drivel. Kazaam is a pointless film, and if you're looking for one of the worst films ever made, then look no further. The acting is awful, the plot is equally bad and so is the directing. There is no redeeming qualities about this film and it's overall, a great waste of time. Watching paint dry is more entertaining than watching this trash. A terrible film that should never have been made, Kazaam definitely scraps the bottom of the barrel of bad ideas, and has nothing good going for it. The only good thing about this film is the end credits. Avoid this film like the plague; you'd be glad you did. This is simply an awful film that's really not worth watching.",

Boy do I feel sorry for my former childhood because I saw a whole heaping pile of crappy movies when I was young. If you're lucky enough to not have seen this movie then you are in for a real ride through hell if you decide to do so. That's what I had to experience when I watched it again, and I could barely tie my arms down to prevent me from scratching my eyes while they were in pain. Its movies like this that should never be made, but for some reason Hollywood keeps on making them. Why? Don't ask me, I'm not a mind reader (that is, if they have minds).\r\n\r\nThe movie fails to satisfy anyone who sees it, unless you're David Armstrong that is. Shaq has got to be one of the worst actors I have ever seen, but I can't really say that because of one tiny problem: he's a BASKETBALL PLAYER, not an ACTOR. The plot doesn't make any sense and fails to give anyone a feeling of interest or excitement. The mere fact that it is irrefutably impossible for something like this to happen helps to make that statement more accurate. There's a reason we don't see Shaq in movies anymore, and this is without a doubt one of them. Don't see this movie unless you feel that you have to see how bad it is, but be sure to wear goggles so that you don't end up doing what I almost did. \r\n\r\nP.S.- for those of you who are asking me if I've seen the Nostalgia Critic review of this film then I'll say yes, and it was funny. \u263a",

While he's singing, one of the lyrics is, \"let's Green Eggs and Ham it\". That's like a five year old writing a rap song. Second, Max is annoying and the villain is just a wannabe bad guy with thick eyebrows. Third, is this movie about slavery? Because in one scene, Max owns Kazaam after he uses up his last two wishes.\r\n\r\nOverall, this movie is just awful. If you're looking for a good movie with a genie, Watch Disney's, \"Aladdin\". That movie has a Genie that can sing and make people laugh. He's also voiced by Robin Williams. A \"GOOD\" actor.\r\n\r\n1/5",

If that's not a plug in for his career,I don't know what is. The kid Max has no likable qualities,he has a very loving mother and a possible step father who cares for him, yet he acts like a total jerk because he's not getting his way with not having his dad around who is a criminal no less! Even when his criminal father kicks him out of his life, Max still does everything to save him,sick isn't it? Shaq, I don't know the writers were thinking.Maybe that it's so funny that a giant basketball super star should be a genie and it's a great way to make a quick buck for those sucker parents who's kids are begging to see the film.I don't know how to say this other than just say it,it really is as bad as everyone says it is if not worse.Trust me,don't waste your sanity on this horrible movie,Shaq's acting is enough to make you wish this movie never existed in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe film starts with a kid who is pretty jerky keying the lockers in the hallway of the school.This kid is somehow 'misunderstood' and you know that no matter how selfish and horrible he is,by the end of the film he'll have learned something and grown.Eventually,while the neighborhood bullies are in the middle of pummeling him,the genie Kazaam (Shaquille O'Neal)is accidentally released and insists on giving the brat three wishes.But,the kid doesn't believe him and the genie's magic seems a tad rusty.\r\n\r\nEventually the brat does realize that Kazaam is for real. However,unlike most kids,he withholds making his wishes so, in the meantime,Kazaam is forced to follow him around everywhere - like his own personal servant.And, according to the clich\u00e9,you know that by the end of the film, Max and Kazaam will have become lifelong buddies and a bunch of tears will be shed.Oh,and Max will have come to terms with his absent father and mom's fianc\u00e9.Apparently this genie is a bit of a social worker in addition to being a granter of wishes.\r\n\r\nOverall,it's a terrible film that is due mostly to writers who were certifiably insane.Yes,folks,with a messed up message,bizarre non-kid friendly material and horrible characters,this is one wretched film.Sadly,given the idea and actors,it's hard to imagine the final product turning out much worse.The only positive thing about this movie is that reminds me my childhood!!!",

This movie is too cheesy, it's like the cheese got burnt, it's so bad.  Do not watch this movie, there are many better movies with the same theme.",

            "content": "This movie really annoyed me. The kid (Francis Capra) is a little brat who spends most of his time on screen acting like a smart-ass and antagonizing everyone he comes across, including the audience. He also tries to establish a relationship with his father, who is involved in organized crime and yet Max still feels he is a viable alternative to his mother (Ally Walker) and his would-be step-father (John Costelloe), who are not that bad. Did I mention he is also stupid? As for Shaq...well...let's just say he is better on the court (well, in his prime anyway) than onscreen. His performance comes off as silly and awkward, though to be fair he does seem to have fun in the role. The two characters do not get along well during any point of the film with the exception of the end (which is kind of required) and in the middle when they engage in a god-awful rap duet, which is one of unfortunately many dumb scenes throughout the picture.\n\nThe worst part about this movie, even more from the performances, is that it does not really make sense. It is supposedly aimed at kids but it spends a lot of time focused on a bunch of criminals and people hanging around clubs. Were the filmmakers trying to bring in Shaq's older fans? I am not sure but whatever they were trying to do, they failed. It is a little odd to be putting that in a film that also features the basketball player riding around on a magical bicycle and making junk food fall down from the sky. As a result, it makes you lose focus on the plot and gives you less reason to about what happens next. It is not helped by a number of plot holes. I will not mention all of them, but here is one example: a stereotypical Middle-Eastern crime lord (Philip Santella) knows all about Kaazam's powers and limitations despite having very the little knowledge about him. Maybe he knows about genies based upon what he learned in his homeland, but we will never know.\n\nWell, there is nothing else I can really say except...the film sucks and I do not recommend it.",

Not just awful, but awful awful.\r\n\r\nWith a movie starring Shaq you pretty much know you're in for trouble, but surprisingly Shaq isn't the worst part of this movie. Yeah his acting, rap, and overall repertoire of skills (outside of basketball) stink, but he's still charming in a \"I have no idea what I'm doing\" sort of way. He's funny to watch because you can tell he feels like an ass for being in the movie, and it shows on the screen. \r\n\r\nThe plot for this movie is as stupid as the poster. Long story short, rapping genie teaches kid how to not be a prick to his mom. The End. The plot stinks, the characters are bland and uninspired, and the musical numbers are torturously bad, but it's the fact that the movie is supposed to be taking seriously that makes it so awful. \r\n\r\nMy memory of this movie was indeed better than the movie itself, and I wish I had let this movie remain a good memory, instead of it becoming more pent up rage.
