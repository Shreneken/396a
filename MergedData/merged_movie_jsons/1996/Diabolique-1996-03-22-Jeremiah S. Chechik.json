            "content": "Oscar Wilde was one of the great wits of his age, but he was allegedly not averse to appropriating other people's bons mots. It is said that after his friend and rival James Whistler had made a particularly apposite remark, Wilde sighed and said \"I wish I had said that!\". Whistler's reply was \"You will, Oscar, you will\". The American film industry has a similar attitude to other people's films to the one that Wilde had to other people's conversation. When the European- particularly the British or French- film industry comes up with a particularly admired film, Hollywood gives a collective sigh and says \"We wish we had made that!\" You will, Hollywood, you will!Recent years have seen a glut of remakes of European films, but, admittedly, the results of this creative plagiarism are by no means always bad. The plot of \"Sommersby\" may have been blatantly lifted from \"Le Retour de Martin Guerre\", but it is still a good film in its own right. Moreover, I was one of those who thought that Luc Besson's \"Nikita\" did not lose much in translation when it was remade as the Bridget Fonda vehicle \"The Assassin\". Sometimes, however, Hollywood manages to come up with a remake that is so inferior to its original model that the two films do not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. \"Diabolique\" is a case in point.Henri-Georges Clouzot's \"Les Diaboliques\" was one of the classic thrillers of the fifties, as good as the best of Hitchcock's work. Jeremiah Chechik's remake borrows the same basic plot of the original, but transfers it from 1950s France to 1990s America. At the centre is the sadistic headmaster of a private school, a man who brutally mistreats not only the boys in his care but also his wife and even his beautiful mistress. The wife and mistress,tired of his mistreatment, plot together to murder him and to dispose of his body in the filthy school swimming pool, but when the pool is later drained the body has disappeared. As in the original, there is a sudden, surprise twist at the end. Chechik also, however,introduces elements that were not in Clouzot's film. The wife, Mia, here becomes a former nun, who has renounced her vows after losing her faith, but is still haunted by guilt. There is a suggestion of a lesbian relationship between Mia and the mistress, Nicole. Chechik also introduces a major character, in the form of a female detective, with no equivalent in the original film.\"Diabolique\" has come in for some sharp criticism, largely because it is a remake of a classic. It is a mediocre film rather than a horrendously bad one, and if we did not have its famous predecessor to compare it with, it would doubtless be seen as just another banal and unsuccessful crime thriller. Nevertheless, I think that the criticism it has attracted is justified. Chechik must have known that one of the perils of remaking a film is that your work will be weighed in the balance against the original, and woe betide you if it is found wanting. And, compared with Clouzot's, Chechik's film is wanting indeed. He lacks the French director's sense of pacing and ability to convey suspense, with the result that his film is slow-moving where the original was brisk and flabby where the original was taut.I was also disappointed by the acting. Isabelle Adjani can be a fine actress in her own language, as she showed in \"La Reine Margot\", but I have not been impressed with her in English-language films, and here her character never came to life. Sharon Stone was slightly better as the hard-bitten, sluttish Nicole, but this was not really one of her better performances and did nothing to alter my view that she has not always chosen the best vehicles in which to show off her talents. Chazz Palminteri's headmaster was almost too unpleasant to be believable, and Kathy Bates seemed wasted as the detective. Watching Clouzot's film I was glued to the screen with anticipation as I wondered how the film would end; watching Chechik's, my attention was rather glued to my watch as I wondered when it would end. 4/10",

            "review_title": "Lackluster remake",
            "content": "The classic French thriller Diabolique has a sturdy story, which is one reason why it is a target for remakes. The film was remade for American television twice - first as Reflections of Murder (featuring Tuesday Weld, Joan Hackett and Sam Waterston) and later as House of Secrets (with Melissa Gilbert and Bruce Boxleitner). To be honest, both of those remakes are certainly interesting to watch, if lacking in the suspense and novelty of the original. Reflections is fairly faithful to its parent, while House of Secrets maintains the bare bones of the storyline and throws in a different setting and some elements of voodoo. If you have not seen the original, the enjoyment level of both those films will be elevated.The same cannot be said for the first dunderheaded attempt to cinematically remake the French classic for American audiences. Keeping the original name, story and setting would seem a step in the right direction, but the film fails due to some incredibly foolish choices.The action takes place at a private boys prep school overseen by the hateful Chazz Palminteri. In between stealing funds from the school, Palminteri enjoys subjecting wife Isabelle Adjani - who suffers from a weak heart - to assorted cruelties. In his spare time, he engages in S&M with ice queen blond teacher Sharon Stone. The two women - tired of his abuse - decide to murder him, drop his body in the disgustingly filthy school pool and make it appear that he drowned in a drunken accident. Naturally, nothing goes according to plan.The best thing about this film is probably the casting of Sharon Stone in the role made famous by French actress Simone Signoret. If anyone embodies some of the same cunning and sensuality of Signoret from the original in a modern actress, it would be Stone. Unfortunately, the screenplay and everything around her fails to support her in any way.The changes made to the screenplay are not improvements. While a remake need not be slavishly faithful to the original, it should not completely go off the beaten path the way that this film does, particularly in its finale. The shock twist ending of the original may no longer be fresh, but the shaggy dog pseudo-feminist tilt tacked on to this latest effort seems to come completely from left field and is a blatant misfire.If Stone was an inspired choice, the remainder of the cast is less so. Isabelle Adjani, looking puffy and listless, is completely underwhelming as the abused wife. At no point does she engage our sympathy and she often seems entirely too lacking in energy to be remotely terrified. This may well be the most laid-back \"frightened\" performance one has ever seen on celluloid.Kathy Bates shows up as a detective investigating Palmineri's disappearance and driving the women to distraction. Her performance is immensely enjoyable and she seems to be having a good time. As a cancer survivor, she gets to crack completely inappropriate jokes and attempts to lay the groundwork for the \"we're all sisters under the skin\" meme that creeps into the film's finale. Unfortunately, her character and performance belongs in a completely different (and one would argue better) film.And the casting of Chazz Palminteri as the abusive schoolmaster is a disaster. Palminteri, providing the same performance here as he does in his guise of the reliable Mafia hit man roles in which he specializes, is laughably miscast. As tough as he comes off, Adjani could arguably physically match him and Stone could step on him without blinking twice. Not only that, but we have to believe that there was something that attracted these two attractive women to him and kept them in his orbit when they could easily have moved on. Palminteri, resembling a large trout, and playing a man with the charisma of a barracuda, seems an impossible prospect for these women. We have to believe that one lovely woman would fall for him (much less two) and no gigantic leap of faith can make this happen.Director Jeremiah Chechik has absolutely no idea how to maintain suspense or an atmosphere of foreboding. The scene shifts are klutzy and obvious. The pacing is often laborious, which allows the viewer time to mull over the complexities of the plots and double-crosses played out before us and realize how absurd the entire scenario truly is - something that the original (as well as its TV remakes) never allowed the viewer time to contemplate. This material needs a skilled hand, but what is provided is a clumsy sledgehammer.The original is noted especially for its shock ending. This remake seems initially to be going for the same thing and then suddenly backtracks - with remorseless characters suddenly developing consciences and people conducting themselves in ways not previously indicated in their respective behavior. By the time all of the leads end up in a watery fight, one realizes what a foolish level to which the film has sunk. One is sternly advised to locate either the original French classic or one of its TV counterparts before descending to this entry.",

            "content": "I heard some really bad things about this remake of the classic French film 'Les Diaboliques', and I would never have expected it to be a patch on the brilliant original anyway; the only reason I even bothered to watch it is because it happened to be on TV, and there happened to be nothing else on. However, after the first half hour or so; while the film indeed is nothing on the original, it seemed like it was going to end up being a decent thriller. But then the problems start; the parts where the original's character reflected on what they'd done were the best parts of the film; here they're extremely boring, and that's where the film falls down. The plot is basically the same as the original and focuses on a school which is ran by a man with a wife and a mistress; neither of which like him. They decide that killing him would be a great idea, and promptly do it. However, after disposing of the body in the school swimming pool and later having it emptied; the body isn't there! And what's worse is that the women start to find clues that he may still be alive...It's a real shame that this film wasn't better as the two female leads are excellent. I'm not sure that I would have made it all the way to the end if it wasn't for the fact that I had the beautiful Isabelle Adjani to admire. It's not her greatest performance and she seems to be on autopilot, but she fits into the scared mousy role well. She is joined by Sharon Stone, who is brilliantly cast as Adjani's colder and more collected opposite number. Stone also looks good, which is certainly a bonus considering the shortcomings of the rest of the film. The problem with the second half of the film is really that it's not interesting, and there aren't enough other things going on to make up for it. There's a hint of a lesbian relationship between the two leads, though nothing really comes of it; definitely a big mistake considering how great they both look! Having already seen the original, the ending came as no surprise; but I'm certain that I could have guessed anyway as there soon becomes only one way that it can go. Overall, I could probably watch Isabelle Adjani all day long; but not when the film in question is this one. There's not much point bothering with this...see the original instead.",

            "review_title": "Blame The Director-Not the Cast",
            "content": "With some of Hollywood's worst trash on his resume, Director Jeremiah Chechik gives us something slightly better than his worst (\"The Avengers\") and much worse than his best (\"Benny and Joon\").This oddly unsatisfying 1996 remake of the classic 1955 French thriller illustrates Hollywood's ham handed ability to turn a classic suspense tale into a weak atmosphere piece. I say oddly because Isabelle Adjani and Sharon Stone are together on the screen for almost the entire film and the two actresses truly bring out the best in each other. So you have a long series of well-played scenes by fine actresses, but they are strung together into a slow paced story line that lacks unity and consistent motivation. Which could be caused by a lot of things but is most likely the result of trimming in post-production, in which important unifying elements were left on the cutting room floor. Or it could be that the director and production designer just failed to translate the writer's vision onto the screen.Since this ultimately this is a story about an evil character who develops a sentimental side, it is absolutely critical that this process is communicated to the audience. The audience should not just be surprised by the ending but should be able to think back and see all the motivational pieces click into place. In this regard the movie is a complete failure.Then there is the issue of cheating. Because we only know what he wants to tell us, a director has a variety of legit ways to introduce misdirection and surprise into a film. But occasionally a director lacks the integrity and vision to play by the rules. Such is the case here as only the audience sees the underwater shot of a clearly drowned Guy (Chazz Palminteri). It is shown to convince us that he is dead but this then makes his reanimation impossible. Plus it is fairly useless because you know that he has to come back for there to be much of a story. That is cheating and there is more cheating in the unintentionally comical climatic scene. The beauty of the original movie was the absence of cheating and the macabre irony of the ending. All that is missing.Whatever, it means that the only reason to watch this version of \"Diabolique\" is for the acting of Adjani and Stone. Although Adjani was 40-41 years old when she made this film, she has lost little of her beauty. While she was probably the world's most beautiful actress in her twenties, there is simply no debate that she was the most beautiful 40 year-old in cinema history. Stone pretty much plays her hard-as-nails self but she is given some great lines and her character is a great contrast to the ethereal take Adjani gives to her own character.If you are looking for a better but less obvious remake of the original \"Diabolique\", track down 1971's \"Let's Scare Jessica To Death\". This almost forgotten horror classic is truly scary. It has much better production design than 1996's \"Diabolique\", with creepy whispering and images that stay with you and creep you out even weeks later. Jessica is a woman recently released from a mental \"institution\" who goes to a farm in a quiet rural area. The odd locals and their local legends begin to mess with Jessica's head as her husband and his secret girlfriend attempt to scare her to death.",

            "content": "To venture a remake of Clouzot's \"Les Diaboliques\" (1955) -- a film that needed no remake in the first place -- only one thing was crucial: a very creative filmmaker with a very personal style, so as to put away comparisons with the classic French film. Someone like Kubrick, Von Trier, Amen\u00e1bar, Chabrol, Jeunet...Instead we have Chechik's ludicrous, inept direction, making the experienced crew's efforts simply bomb: the cinematography is flat, the music is predictable, the script is stale, the pace is sloooow, and he manages to withdraw bad performances from EVERYONE in the cast, including the usually reliable Kathy Bates, besides achieving the incredible feat of making Isabelle Adjani look like she's just escaped from Madame Tussaud's, and cruelly exposing the unmistakably limited talents of Sharon Stone (who manages to look like a dominatrix in the role of a Catholic school teacher!!) and Chazz Palminteri.When a film is THIS bad, considering the names involved and the amount of money spent, it's really an insult to everyone, most of all to the audience (of course). After this bomb, you'd think Hollywood directors would just leave classic thrillers alone -- but Gus Van Sant went on to commit the catastrophic remake of \"Psycho\".... Don't waste your time - just don't watch it, especially if you are a fan of the original film or of the stars!!! My vote: since IMDb doesn't allow zeroes, 1/10 is more than it deserves.",

            "content": "I saw that 'Diabolique' was showing on a cable movie channel, and I had heard great things about it, and so I was prepared to be impressed and intrigued, and to improve my 'cultural literacy' in the process.Instead, what I got was a draggy, lifeless 'film noir' remake with Sharon Stone and Chazz Palmintieri. The frustrating thing about the movie was that it was JUST GOOD ENOUGH and kept JUST ENOUGH of the elements of the original plot to make me hope that things would improve somehow. So I kept watching it. But it never did.I am not Sharon Stone's biggest fan, but I acknowledge that she gave a compelling performance in \"Casino\", and that very few actresses past or present could have played her role better. (Joan Crawford or Betty Davis, maybe). And she's a black hole of bitterness and anger here -somehow sexually inviting and repellent at the same time. That doesn't make for comfortable viewing. There's the same problem with the lesbian undercurrents between the wife and the mistress - it ought to be titillating or erotic, but it's just stale and nasty. And Chazz Palmintieri is a great character actor( see 'The Usual Suspects' or \"Bullets Over Broadway\"), but the character he plays is such a flat-out son-of-a-bitch that you really don't want to watch him.But the real the problem with the film is that they were going for dread and suspense, but the pacing and rhythms of each of the individual scenes was way off - empty and interminable. So the viewer wound up feeling dread and BOREDOM instead. That doesn't make for 'recommended film viewing'.I still hope to seek out the original one of these days, so at least the remake didn't spoil anything. And some one else might like this version just fine on its own merits, depending on how big a Stone fan they are (it is really her movie - her character drives the events in the plot).",

What might have happened to the body of Guy Baran?\"Diabolique\" is a poor and unnecessary American remake of a 1955 French classic directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot. The director Jeremiah S. Chechik succeeds not only in destroying the story and the atmosphere of the original film with clich\u00e9s and a boring slow pace, but also in wasting a great cast with names such as Sharon Stone, Isabelle Adjani, Chazz Palminteri and Kathy Bates.

If you are interested in narrative structure, you'll be interested in remakes of films and how they change. (I think these are changes to the original.)First, in true folding style, they added a film within the film. The film within is a recruiting film, but that hardly matters.Second, they changed the dynamic of the detective by making him a her. This allows for the third change but along the way the possibilities exist for the three types of women: the virgin, the whore and the shrew. It isn't played up well enough to matter, but its clear that someone's intuition was tuned.Third, there is a final twist that I think is quite different than the original's. It bonds the three women, already hinted in a lesbian tendency between the first two. But amazingly, the film didn't work well for me, probably because of pacing problems at various levels. Not that any level was off by the interplay of levels wasn't syncopated according to what engages. Its an intuitive process, I think, but quite rigid in its rules.Isabelle Adjani was cast perfectly, and introduced very skillfully.

            "content": "Diabolique is set in Pennsylvania at the St. Anselm's boarding school for boys which is owned by Mia Baran (Isabelle Adjani), however her husband Guy (Chazz Palminteri) who runs the school treats her like dirt & cheats on her. Mia & a teacher named Nicole Horner (Sharon Stone) whom is one of Guy's many lovers devise a plan to kill him & make it look like an accident, the plan is to drown him & then throw him in the school pool where he will be found & to the police his death will seem like a simple drowning. However after a few days the body isn't found so Mia orders the dirty pool drained when Nicole 'accidently' drops her keys into it, once drained Guy's body is not there. Was Guy dead? Did someone find out there plan? Who knows...Directed by Jeremiah Chechik this is a remake of the black and white French film Les Diaboliques (1955) which itself was based on the novel 'Celle Qui N'Etait Plus' by Pierre Boileau & Thomas Narcejac & I thought was a fairly lazy & plodding mystery thriller with truly one of the worst twist endings ever. The humourless & slow moving script by Don Ross takes ages to do what the average episode of Columbo took about 10 minutes to, to show someone committing the so-called perfect murder. Then it switches to creepy thriller mode as the body vanishes from where the murderers left it & seemingly has come back to life before it all falls apart with one of the worst, most predictable & frankly unlikable twist endings ever. I can't continue my review any further without massive spoilers which will give away the ending so beware, anyway I hate the fact that Mia & Nicole suddenly turn into the heroes of the piece when they were just as bad as Guy since in the case of Mia she planned to kill him in cold blood & Nicole was prepared to trick Mia & ultimately kill her if the plan had succeeded. They were really unlikable character's to begin with so this horrible ending where they become the heroes by killing Guy which is basically exactly the same thing which they set out to do in the first place just grated my nerves. Also, if Mia was feeling so guilty why did she seem almost redeemed at the end? She still ended up killing Guy anyway so why the miraculous change of heart? Also, what about Nicole? She still was part of some scheme where someone was always going to die, be it either Mia or Guy. The ending is just so misjudged, it makes no sense with the rest of the context of the film, it's horribly acted & it's utterly predictable. In fact I guessed how this would end within 30 minutes & I was absolutely right in just about every detail. A really horrible film with an even worse ending, one to avoid.Director Chechik has made some really, really awful films & after this mess & his subsequent big screen adaptation of The Avengers (1998) which is considered one of the worst films ever made Hollywood thankfully hasn't let him anywhere near a film camera since. This guy should be directing traffic rather than films. This is blandly shot in dull autumnal colours which give it forgettable look. I also have to mention the acting, especially by the two female leads Stone & Adjani who are simply terrible. I hated their character's, I hated their acting & thought they were two of the worst performances by leading actors in a Hollywood flick I've ever seen. In the UK this is rated '18' meaning no-one under that age can watch it, I have no idea why as there's no violence worth mentioning, no nudity or sex & it's devoid of any action or excitement.Technically the film is alright but it's flat, dull & blandly filmed. There's no real style here & it's not a film I will remember in any way apart from that terrible ending. As I've said I think the acting by the two leads is simply awful.Diaboliques is a slow moving, utterly predictable thriller with a horrible ending that didn't do anything for me. One to avoid. This probably would have worked better as a 30 minute Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode or maybe even as an obscure black and white French film from the 50's...",

            "content": "OK, so I just adore this little flop of a movie. The look, the acting (especialy Stone, Bates and Knight) and the screenplay all converge toward a distinctly campy second degree, sometimes close to comedy. Make it black comedy.Don't get me wrong, I'm a big Clouzot fan; Le Corbeau is one of my all time favorite, and his original Diaboliques, based on Boileau and Narcejac short story, ranks prominently in my list, too. And frankly, I was quite ambivalent about it being remade. And then I heard of the casting (Stone/Adjani), which is a once in a lifetime kinda thing and the choice of giving direction to then newcomer Jeremiah Chechick, still fresh from his well received debut Benny and Joon.So I told to myself, \"Hey, could be worse\". But I wasn't entirely convinced. Of course, I didn't know then that Don Roos had penned the laced in acid screenplay with the tongue firmly in cheek.Stone's Nicole: \"You're dead, this is heaven and I'm the Vigin Mary. Can you swallow?\" This is one of my favorite line, ever. That Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolfe homage with Shirley Knight is also priceless.To appreciate this movie, I think you must be a camp addict, or a gay, or both. One way or the other, the audience for this kind of sophisticated junk seems to be timid, or easily convinced to doubt of its own tastes. Maybe that's why Basic Instinct 2, a very similar outing, flopped. Too bad.",

Isabelle Adjani plays a nun who quits because she has no faith anymore. She, Sharon Stone and Chazz Palminteri all run a Catholic boys school and bash Christianity themselves. Other teachers at the school are also shown in a bad light. There is not one positive Christian in the Christian school! Well, that's way too much bias for me.

            "content": "(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon.)This is a sexploitation thriller but not all that bad, mainly because it is played somewhat tongue-in-cheek so that the plot absurdities might be overlooked in the interest of high camp, or at least in the interest of a mild diversion, and also because the women are diabolically diverting each in her own way.Especially effective in a satirical performance is Sharon Stone as Nicole Horner, a duplicitous siren teaching math at a boy's boarding school. (Just the thought conjures up visions of a vampish Mary Kay Letoureau, although director Jeremiah Chechik studiously avoids that angle.) Her partner in crime is French actress Isabelle Adjani who plays Mia Baran, an ex-nun who is the owner of the school unhappily married to (after being seduced by, it appears) the school's sadistic task master Guy Baran played with a steady macho malevolence by Chazz Palminteri. Adjani, whom I recall (vividly) from Truffaut's L'Histoire d'Adele H. (1975) in which she played Victor Hugo's daughter Adele who was obsessively in love with an English army lieutenant who didn't want her. The masochistic persona employed there is revisited here as Mia is used by both her husband and Nicole Horner, who is also Guy's mistress.Coming lately onto the scene is Kathy Bates as a man-despising, middle-aged, slightly butch Nancy Drew who doesn't let a partial mastectomy slow her down as she sleuths about looking for clues. She has some fine one-liners, but perhaps the best in the film comes from Sharon Stone. Two of the school's middle-aged bores have just come upon Stone and Adjani in the courtyard. Stone's ever-present cigarette inspires this from one of the men: \"Don't you know that second-hand smoke kills?\" Sharon Stone maneuvers past him, blows smoke in his face, and replies, \"Not reliably.\"This is a remake of Les Diaboliques (1955) starring Simone Signoret which I have not seen. My guess is that the French version played it straight and made the ending at least plausible. Here we have not only a ridiculous ending but a plot in dire need of a plot doctor. I have also not seen the TV version, Reflections of Murder, starring that quintessential sex-kitten (and personal favorite) Tuesday Weld. Anybody got a copy?Bottom line: see this for Isabelle Adjani, whose over the top performance is garnished with an au naturale glimpse, and for Sharon Stone who is at her diabolical best. Be aware however that if sexual exploitation of the male libido is not your cup of tea, you will not like this movie, and even if it is, you may find the story more than a bit silly.",

But you've got to give points to a movie that dares to make Sharon Stone a math teacher (at an all-boys school, no less!).

However the body goes missing and it appears that someone is pretending that Guy is still alive.  Meanwhile a private investigator begins to suspect something is amiss.With a solid cast I had reasonable hopes for this film.  It all looks classy enough with good direction, however the plot is a pretty basic thriller plot that will remind many viewers of something else that they have seen.  The film has several twists that will be apparent before they happen and it does sadly lack thrills and tension for much of the film.The cast try hard but are hampered by a plot that works nicely on a storyboard but doesn't really engage onscreen.  The characters are also a bit too flat and never really give the actors a chance to show off.  Stone is stuck in another tough vamp role that she just goes with without putting bones onto it.  Adjani is a good actress but she can't really deliver here, likewise Palminteri is simply mugging it as a monstrous wife beater. Bates is given a very small role, why she has to be a survivor from breast cancer is beyond me - it just seems to be mentioned a lot for no clear reason. The relationships between the characters are not really worked out, they are as thin as the characters are.  Particularly, Mia and Nicole's relationship could have been stronger, instead it is very middle of the road and didn't interest me - despite some lesbian teasing from Stone.Although it all looks good and has a strong list of names in the cast the film fails to really inspire.  I wasn't really engaged that much, part of the mystery kept me interested but I felt that the twists and final payoff weren't really that surprising.  Worth seeing but really not very different.",

Sharon Stone mincing around in an oddly wired looking walk with trampy tight clothes and really high heels and the strangest lipstick that doesn't leave a mark on her frequently lit cigarettes (she's a school teacher in a private school, Catholic, yeah that's believable).

Reduced to dull slasher clich\u00e9s and slow pacing. Chazz Palminteri stars as a school headmaster who is involved with two women. He abuses them until they sum up the urge to kill him. They dump the body in the pool outside but he survives and seeks revenge. Story relies on formula but director Jeremiah Chechik uses style to execute it. This is an odd choice of material for a director who made National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation and Benny and June. Sharon Stone is reciting her Basic Instinct territory as a teacher with an icy personality, while Isabelle Adjani plays a fragile mistress whom Stone will become involved with. Palminteri's role is that of questionable fate when his body goes missing. Kathy Bates appears as an inspector in a role that is both standard and corrupt. The original is thrilling entertainment at its best and scary at that. It was haunting and suspenseful while this remake is well crafted yet reduced to a sexed up slasher film with a climax bent on violence. It sucks that modern audiences cannot view a film like this without manipulative crap thrown in.

The two women work together to kill Guy for all the wrongs he'd done.My assumption is that they would reveal over time why he deserved to be killed. We got glimpses of his overbearing abusive behavior to give us an idea, but nothing to make him loathed enough to be killed (or maybe it was enough to be killed). Either way, when he was killed I had not a care one way or the other if the two women were caught or they got away with it. Nicole was a sharp-tonged strumpet while Mia was this doe-eyed lost puppy. Mia had a perpetual look of lost, confused, and in need of guidance. It was pathetic and annoying.And because the writers were at a loss of how to advance the plot they dropped Kathy Bates into the movie out of nowhere. I mean literally out of nowhere. She heard that Mia was looking for her husband and decided that it would become her life's mission to find him or what happened to him. Her character made no sense as did much of this drivel.

            "content": "Character uses another to kill third one. Then the used character, always the less vicious and the more emotional, discovered the ugly truth of being used to serve hidden purposes for the first character, and its hidden associate. Sometimes that associate could be the murdered party, sometimes the deceived could be a man or a woman, and many times it's from that deceived one's point of view.Since (Double Indemnity - 1944), this very formula, in the Noir movies or the crime movies, is so popular. Although there are endless ways to recycle and create through this old story, but most of the products along the years weren't excellent or even unpredictable.Based on a French movie or not, (Diabolique) isn't original or that good. It's even unconvincing at places, and rather idiot at others!Since the whole thing is about killing the sick kind wife, then why not to use less complicated ways? And if the husband is that sadistic deceitful, why not to divorce him easily? And how oh how this husband brooked this amount of water for all of this time? He must be Aquaman!Some of the situations looked so forced; such as the compulsory bad lunch. Some of characters' reactions were so horribly bad; (Adjani) smiles outrageously among the professors at the lunch's table, while she's presumably so sad and confused because of her husband's disappearance. And some of the choices were pointless; why it's a school, not a hotel? A hospital? Or a company??The intentions of (Kathy Bates)'s character were vague. There was no need for the character of the boy who peeks at his teacher in the bathroom! And I didn't hear about a TV commercial that took this long to be filmed; clearly the 2 camera guys were living in the school for more than a week. Which reminds me, this movie has a sluggish pace!Just like the gratuitous nudity here, the need for a lesbian relationship between the 2 leading women seemed for pure commercial purpose, more than a dramatic motive; as a sexual tension between the 2 leads. Yet, it's more powerful to watch (Stone) rescues (Adjani) in the end, because she lastly felt the bound between them as 2 aggrieved women, not a \"loving couple\" where in this case; the rescue becomes ordinary deed. Btw, a sly notice: this movie came out one year after TV shows like Xena: Warrior Princess (1995), and one year before another one: Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997). I'll leave it to your intelligence to figure out the connections, and what it could say about American woman of the mid-1990s.The performance was truly laughable from (Isabelle Adjani)'s side. She was astounded, absentminded, sad, or scared all by the same goggled eyes. I can't blame (Palmentieri) since the script dealt with him as a stereotypical evil husband. (Sharon Stone) did some fair acting; I think she was the only winner in this cast.Eventually, you have to ask yourself why they didn't call it \"Scare Your Wife to Death\"?!, but Ahh, that could've ruined it. However, with that ending, it deserves a title like \"Treat Women Well, Otherwise They'll Kill You!\", although it fits this story right, but that could've ruined it too! In fact, the movie's finale makes it an explicit manifesto about how women, all the different kinds of women, CAN unite to kill one vile man, and get away with it. So the message is for men exclusively: \"Be aware, because hell has no fury like a woman scorned, and law has no hands to imprison her either\"!In its core, all what the movie wanted was being a thriller, the thing is it ended up as something between average and poor, despite the glow of it, especially with grand music, well cinematography, and interesting direction. So to sum it all up: While it's supposed to be a thrilling mystery, this movie made me fall asleep in front of it. Sorry.. not that diabolic!",

It's a tough film to make as it tries to achieve too many things at once, it tries to pay homage to the original, have a modern day take on the story, and stay true to the directors identity and vision and on top of all that try to showcase the talent of the huge names in the film like Stone, Bates and Adjani. So one can imagine how hard it was for audience to comprehend this experience. The best way to enjoy this one is not to call it a remake and to focus on the plot details and cinematography, bearing in mind that there are some cheesy campy elements and some absurd twists but that's all part of the charm.

            "content": "Diabolique is a pretty interesting and gripping story about two women who kill a man. Then they try to hide the corpse in a school pool, the school where they tutor people; nevertheless it seems to have vanished itself after a while. This story is mysterious and once you follow the story, it will hook you from beginning to end. I really enjoyed seeing this movie, but it was somewhat disappointing at the end. I was expecting for much more. Another reason why I saw this movie was because the beautiful and stylish Isabelle Adjani was playing in it. She's really one of the most beautiful and talented women I have ever seen in my whole life. Her performance in \"La reine Margot\" was amazing. This woman really knows how to act. Just after I discovered that she was portraying Mia in this movie, I saw it at once. She made it worthwhile even though the ending was disappointing. As for Sharon Stone, What can I say? I consider she was plausible and interesting as Nicole; she envelops herself into the role very well. However I don't understand why she got a razzie award nomination, her performance wasn't that bad. Anyway I can't do anything about it. Some parts of `Diabolique' just miss the point. It really doesn't make a clear story. I have to warn you ahead of time that there are some possible spoilers: How could Nicole (Sharon Stone) find out that Mia's husband was alive? I know it was unexpected, but I really didn't understand it. As for the ending, I consider it was quite simple, they just killed the man again in the pool, it's not exciting; I was expecting for much more from the acting and the plot. Anyway I really liked the first hour of this movie, that's why I rate a 7 out of a 10.",

I of course learned to absolutely worship Sharon Stone (Basic Instinct) in her cold, campy, iciness. But even more than that this film is as absolutely delicious guilty pleasure. Although I've never seen the original classic this one centers around two women living in a posh boarding school. Mia played by an ethereal Isabella Adjani (Possession) is constantly berated and emotionally abused by her awful husband played by a monstrous Chazz Palminteri (Usual Suspects) who just so happens to be having an affair with one of the school's teacher Nicole (Stone). The two women are surprisingly friends and hatch a plan to murder the husband which they seemingly do until his body disappears and a mystery begins. Kathy Bates (Misery) also stars as a charasmatic detective. The movie is flooded with the campfest dialogue like \"you should try praying, wear your knees out that way for a change\". It's just delicious and criminally underseen. Aside from the amazing camp the film is ultra stylish from its gorgeous retro inspired cinematography to the 60s inspired wardrobe worn perfectly by the gorgeous Sharon Stone. It's also a surprisingly immersive and suspenseful ride. The twists are unique and intriguing and the movie is always entertaining.Budget: $39m\nBox Office: $17m4.25/5",

Tall, blonde Sharon Stone actually was a good choice to play the Simone Signoret role, but Stone totally camps it up, making it very difficult to take anything even remotely seriously about her. Isabelle Adjani, one of France's most beautiful and talented actresses, does well in the Vera Clouzot role, but Chazz Palminteri comes across as too much of a pompous jerk that one couldn't care less what happens to him. As if Stone and Palminteri weren't enough to insure this project's failure, the screenwriter completely changed the ending!

And did it star Sharon Stone, who skipped being in The Flintstones to make this?Directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik, whose career includes Benny & Joon, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation and then this and The Avengers, this has a script by Don Roos, who also wrote Single White Female so you'd think he'd understand that whole concept of American giallo.This is a movie with the absolute worst threeway relationship ever. Mia Baran (Isabelle Adjani) is a devout Catholic who works at a school with her husband Guy (Chazz Palminteri), a man so abusive that even his mistress Nicole Horner (Stone) feels badly for Mia, who we first meet as she nearly dies in a bathtub.The two women decide that they've finally had it with Guy and lure him to an apartment of one of Nicole's friends. Mia drugs him, they drown him in a bathtub and then carry his body out in a wicker box that they can barely get into the trunk. They toss his body in the swimming pool and when it disappears and photos of them killing him are mailed to the school, things get tense.Also: that's not just Donal Logue filming the school, but also J. J. Abrams. Kathy Bates shows up as an investigator, Spalding Grey - who died by a suicidal drowning - is a teacher and Bingo O'Malley - it's a bigger deal if you're from here - is in this too.There are twists and turns - as you can imagine - as well as Stone hitting Palmieri in the head with a rake. I laughed out loud when that happened. It's not good, but also it's good because it's Sharon Stone in a bad 90s remake of a movie that inspired so many other movies to the point that a remake feels beyond without reason.Also: if you live in Pittsburgh, you realize that they're just throwing names of cities out there. Come on, Sharon Stone. You're from Meadville.I always discuss that Stone would have totally been in an Umberto Lenzi giallo if she were around in the 70s. Her career path proves this. But as I keep track of what movies are Yinzer giallo - psychosexual murder movies made in the Steel City - this does not qualify. Sure, it has sex and murder, but it doesn't get the geography right, theree are no accents and no one goes to a bar and has an IC Light. Nor do they visit a single landmark.

            "content": "\"Diabolique\", a remake of the 1955 French horror/thriller \"Les Diaboliques\", centers on Mia Baran (Isabelle Adjani), a devout Catholic woman who is married to an abusive headmaster, Guy (Chazz Palminteri), with whom she runs an all boy's school. She is fairly close to his mistress, Nicole Horner (Sharon Stone), who is a teacher at the school, and the two conspire a plot to murder him. After the deed is done, they dispose of his body in the school's filthy swimming pool... but when the pool is drained, his body is gone, and strange things begin to haunt them, while a nosy detective (Kathy Bates) begins to catch onto the elaborate plot.To start off with, I consider the original \"Les Diaboliques\" one of the best horror movies of all time - it's painfully suspenseful, genuinely creepy, and has one of the best twist-endings I've ever seen. So, I went into this remake with fairly low expectations, and that may have been why I didn't mind it so much. I knew there was no possible way this re-imagining could out- do the original. So, with that said, I found this film to be a fairly entertaining thriller, even though I knew all the twists and turns of the plot ahead of time. The film takes place in modern day, but maintains a very 1950s feel, with the wardrobe and the old-fashioned architecture of the school. It's surprisingly pretty faithful to the original movie, too, with a few changes scattered about, some for the better and some for the worst. I thought the update of the murder scene was well executed, as was the climax of the film (again, even though I was aware of what to expect). However, as expected, we do have a very \"Hollywood\" ending - the movie follows the original closely until the last ten minutes, where the conclusion becomes what most American movie-goers would expect. I can't say it's necessarily that awful, and I wasn't expecting the writers to follow the cold, ambiguous conclusion the original had. I suppose I was a tad bit disappointed they didn't stick with the original ending, but what they did do with the new ending was clever.I'd say my biggest complaint here was the absence of ambiguity and suspense the original film upheld. The suspense was fairly secondhand in comparison, and I'd like to have seen improvement there. Acting-wise, I have mixed feelings. Sharon Stone, I felt, was fairly poor at times in her delivery and overall performance, while at other times she did quite well. Her performance was a bit topsy-turvy, but she was good enough, and does have the right 'look' for the part. Isabelle Adjani was great, she made her character very lovable, and her melancholy facial expressions were priceless. Chazz Palminteri was also good in the abusive, jerk-of-a-husband role. I also enjoyed Kathy Bates in the role of the detective, which was played by a male in the original. She's a great actress and played her quirky, offbeat role excellently. Overall, \"Diabolique\" is a bit of a mixed bag. I enjoyed it mainly because I found the re- imagining of the story an interesting idea, and the re-construction of some of those classic scenes was neat to watch. The problem with this film is if you see it before you see the 1955 version, you probably will enjoy it because the story and plot twists are really clever. However, if you've already seen the original, the story is essentially spoiled. I personally enjoyed watching the re-construction of it though, even with it's faults. I'd say this 1996 version of the story is a decent companion piece to the original - it's fairly entertaining, but can't hold a candle to the film it was based upon. 6/10.",

Although, I have yet to see the original, which I've been told is absolutely amazing, this version is completely the opposite. It is not terrible at all, not unwatchable in the slightest, just not all that good. The plot is dark and sinister but for some reason limps along and has no tension to it. This is a movie that one can easily watch with their friends and a good pizza and beer and talk while it's on, confident they won't get to confused. That's the type of movie it is.If the original is really that good maybe that's the problem. Sometimes remakes just can't hold a candle to the original. I wouldn't Rate this higher then a 5 at most.There's nothing awful to say about it but there's just not a lot of edge of your seat excitement and drama. There's also this dark slow moving quality to it that like I said may make for a good light summer's night viewing with friends but does not approach anything unforgettable.The casting may have been part of the problem as well because I didn't buy into that aspect all that much and thought there were some miscasts. Still, if one wants a movie where they don't have to concentrate to hard or get to deeply involved it makes for a decent viewing. But all in all, this is not a movie I'd probably see again.

Mia gets together with Guy's also abused mistress, who got her left eye blackened by him, Nicole Horner played by an ultra sexy looking Sharon Stone who's also a teacher at the boys school. The two abused women plan to finally do away with the creep and make his death look like a drowning accident. It takes a while for the very Catholic observing Mia to agree to Nicole's plan to murder Guy but the way he treats her,like dirt, pushes her over the edge in willing to do him in.Luring Guy away from the boys school where he resides both Nicoel and Mia have him secretly travel to a friends home, the Danzingers, in Pittsburgh where they plan to murder him. It's there that Mia got the brutish Guy drunk, which wasn't that hard top do, on booze that was spiked with a number of strong sleeping pills. With Guy out cold the two dumped him into the bathtub and with the help of what looked like a ten gallon bottle filled with water,to keep him from floating to the surface, ended up drowning him. It's when back at the boys school when Nicole & Mia dumped the boozed and drugged up as well as dead Guy into the school swimming pool that strange things started to happen! Guy not only didn't go to the bottom he didn't even go to the top of the pool? In fact he just plumb disappeared from sight over or under the water line!The rest of the movie has Mia, the weaker of the two murderesses, slowly going to pieces in not only what she did in murdering her husband but far worse in not knowing where his body is in order to give it a decent Catholic burial! Going to the local police to have them track down her missing husband Mia is spotted by retired lady detective Shirley Vogel, Kathy Bates, who smells a big story and takes over the investigation in the missing Guy Barnan.***SPOILERS*** It doesn't take long for Vogel to realized that something isn't exactly kosher in Guy's mysterious disappearance. Checking out all the facts Vogel finds out that Guy was embezzling the funds for the boys school and planning to bankrupt it in order to throw off suspicion on himself by the local police. What's even more interesting is that Guy's partner in crime was non other then Nicoe Horner! His mistress whom, as Vogel soon suspects, was very possibly his murderer as well!The unexpected and shocking final in the film in fact outdoes the original, the 1955 French version, with the truth coming to the surface in what was the real reason in murdering Guy and who were the one's who cooked it up in the first place! This was enough to give you, like one of the principle characters in the movie, an almost fatal heart attack! The fact that the intended victim of this elaborately planned scheme didn't end up dropping dead from fright turned out to be disastrous for those who planned it!",

Of course it's awful, but it's also so bad it's entertaining. \"You can have $25,000 for your goddamn fried chicken\" is one of the greatest lines ever uttered in a film. Forget \"Rosebud\" it's all about the fried chicken in this nonsensical thriller that never makes sense. While the plot about two women plotting to kill a man who has wronged them both, killing him, and then a mysterious stranger sending blackmail is intriguing, the plot itself is a jumbled, hilariously bad mess. When the plot twists come, you'll be scratching your head and then realizing that none of it makes any sense and very little is explained. Diabolique is a film I would only only recommend to B-movie fans because it works terrifically as an unintentional comedy. But if you're looking for a serious thriller, you won't find it here.",

Something about the pacing leaves the viewer less than compelled, the script is probably slightly lame too. The acting is pretty good, the cinematography/setting/ambience is probably slightly better, the neighbours who help carry the wicker chest are much less irritating, the ending is much better.
