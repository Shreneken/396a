            "content": "Autumn Sonata was a movie that did move me a lot, but I'd hesitate in calling it one of Ingmar Bergman's best. I did find The Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, Fanny and Alexander, Cries and Whispers and Persona even better. This said, apart from an occasional over-load of speeches that come across as too theatrical, Autumn Sonata is still a remarkably good film. As ever with Bergman, it is wonderfully photographed(by none other than Sven Nykvist) and directed, and it has some lovely scenery too. The music is beautiful and haunting, I have to say as a life-long fan of classical music that the use of the Chopin prelude is one of the finest uses of classical music in film to me. The script is mostly thought-provoking and the story, which is essentially a study of guarded emotion, resentment and regret, has the Bergman darkness and harrowing moments like with the sister with the horrible degenerative disease and the drowned toddler. Charlotte's selfishness is also very powerfully conveyed as is Eva's sense of resentment, while the scene that moved me most was the two at the piano. Both leading ladies are outstanding, Ingrid Bergman's elegant but somewhat faded beauty is ideal for the selfishness of her character, but I was even more impressed by Liv Ullman, who has such intensity in her eyes and facial expressions. All in all, powerful and moving, and while it is not one of my favourites from Bergman it is still highly recommendable. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "review_title": "Powerful Drama From Ingmar Bergman",
            "content": "Writer/director Ingmar Bergman examines the strained relationship between a mother and daughter in `Autumn Sonata,' starring Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullmann.  Eva (Ullmann) has not seen her mother, Charlotte (Bergman) in seven years; a successful concert pianist, Charlotte has spent a good portion of her life on the road, but after losing her long-time companion, Leonardo, Eva invites her to come to the parsonage where she and her minister husband, Viktor (Halvar Bjork), live, for an extended visit. Charlotte accepts, but soon after her arrival, old wounds and feelings begin to surface, and the film becomes an intimate character study of the life-long dysfunctional relationship between Charlotte and Eva, during which director Bergman intricately examines the causes and effects of all that has passed between them during their lives.  It's an in-depth look at the emotional damage human beings are capable of inflicting upon one another, and how fragile the line between love and hate becomes when subjected to incessant neglect by even one of the parties involved.  As the story unfolds and the principals bare their souls-- at last revealing a lifetime's worth of repressed feelings-- it becomes an emotionally devastating experience for the audience, as well, for there is much contained within the dynamics of this situation that most viewers will be able to identify with and relate to within their own lives. \tIngmar Bergman is a Master of presenting life as it truly is; reality-- and portraying it on the screen-- is his domain, and throughout his career he has veritably created almost a genre of his own in doing so.  With a microscope of his own design, he scrutinizes the basic instincts of the human condition, what makes people tick and how and why they relate to one another as they do.  Much of what he presents is startling, and always emotionally involving, because he penetrates so deeply and succinctly into the heart of the matter, as he demonstrates so superlatively with this film. His methods and style are unique, his talent unequivocal; many others have attempted to capture the essence of that which Bergman has perfected, but few have succeeded.  Interestingly enough, Liv Ullmann is one who, as a director, has probably come the closest to achieving that classic `sense' of Bergman, with her films `Private Confessions,' and `Faithless,' both of which were written by Bergman. \tIn her role as Eva, Ullmann gives one of the best performances of her career, for which she should have at least been nominated for an Oscar; that she was not is nothing less than a gross injustice.  She so skillfully conveys the depth and complexities of her character, and the differing emotional levels to which Eva is subjected, that it creates a lasting impression and makes her someone with whom it is easy for the audience to sympathize.  It makes you realize, upon reflection, what a truly gifted actress Ullmann is.  And, as good as Ullmann's performance here is, it is equaled-- though not, I would say-- surpassed, by Ingrid Bergman's portrayal (in her final theatrical appearance) of Charlotte; and in a renewal of faith that there is some justice in the world after all, she received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress for it.  In retrospect, it seems somehow inevitable that the two Bergmans came together at last, though it's somewhat lamentable that their career paths did not cross sooner.  There is some consolation, however, in the fact that when they did finally join forces the result was such a powerful, memorable film. \tThe supporting cast includes Lena Nyman (Helena), Gunnar Bjornstrand (Paul), Erland Josephson (Josef) and Linn Ullmann (Eva as a child).  An intelligent, thought provoking and emotionally wrenching film, highlighted by outstanding performances and beautifully photographed by Sven Nykvist, `Autumn Sonata' is an example of filmmaking at it's best; it's a lasting tribute, not only to the immense talents of Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullmann, but to Ingrid Bergman, one of the most beautiful and gifted actresses ever to grace the silver screen.  I rate this one 10/10.",

            "content": "This is a beautiful and devastating film that I admire, love and am connected to. This was the first Liv Ullmann's film I've seen and the first Bergman's color film. It is considered to be Ingrid Bergman's film and she is phenomenal as a talented and world renowned pianist who had never been a good mother to her two daughters. It is much easier to make the whole world happy then your own child. One can be a brilliant artist and read the minds of the other great minds easily but the hearts and souls of one's own blood and flesh would be the unsolved mystery. I think the film was very personal for both Bergmans in their only work together. It is amazing how bravely they explore the themes and events that could've (and did) occurred in their own lives. For me, though, the film belongs to Liv Ullmann, the greatest actress I've seen, the best Ingmar Bergman's actress.I was riveted to Liv's face; I'd never seen the face like hers. She played a plain daughter to the brilliant mother and she was supposed to look and feel awkward and gawky comparing to her mother but her face was like a magnet, her eyes - like two deep blue lakes. If ever the saying, the eyes are the soul's mirror, is true, it is about Liv's eyes. There are kindness, tenderness, strength, and something even more attractive than beauty itself in them - the goodness of her soul. Dostoyevsky said once that human face has to mean something - I always think of his words when I see performance of my favorite actress ever -Liv Ullmann.",

Ingrid Bergman is terrific, despite a deliberately naff hairdo which makes her look like Queen Elizabeth II of the UK rather than the faded beauty she is.  Liv Ullman also has visual nuances to enhance her character - the glasses, platted hair and jumpers enabling this beautiful woman to look frumpy.The acting is simply amazing, even through the subtitles you can tell. Fortunately Scandinavian vocal nuance is similar enough to English to enable us non-Swedish speakers to appreciate the acting.Of course, it has the Ingmar Bergman darkness to it.  The sister with the horrible degenerative disease, the drowned toddler, the selfishness of the Ingrid Bergman character.  If you get depressed along with the characters in films like this, you might be better off giving this one a miss.But for those with a taste for this type of claustrophobic drama, this is one of the most powerful films you will ever see.",

            "content": "Generally, either \"Seventh Seal\" or \"Persona\" is the film that a critic will name if s/he is stuck with the task of naming Ingmar Bergman's greatest achievement.  A couple others might be named, but rarely do you hear a critic espouse the brilliance of \"Autumn Sonata.\"The first thing I noticed about this film is that it is, like \"Cries and Whispers,\" nothing less than a painting.  The textures, the warm reds and the close-ups of the faces of wounded souls, all combine to make the viewer realize that s/he is witnessing High Art.Then there's the shot of  Liv Ullman's wounded profile as she stares at her mother, Ingrid Bergman, while mother shows Liv how the Chopin piece should be played.  It is an eloquent scene.  Truly heartbreaking and unforgettable. One can feel Liv's pain begin to show itself: it is the painful shame of inadequacy and mediocrity made all the more shameful because it is mother inspiring these feelings in her.Later, it's Liv's cruelty toward her mother in that unforgettable late night diatribe.And finally, it's Liv's crippled sister and Ingrid's disgust at the thought that not only did mediocrity crawl out of her womb, but so did deformity and suffering.The film is bleak (obviously) and the resolution is only slightly hopeful. It is however a masterpiece -- a film that reveals that what the world needs now is not Love, as the song proclaims, but Compassion and Grace.  Liv Ullman is the only actress who can say these things without opening her mouth.  Ingmar Bergman is the only filmmaker who can make a seemingly banal story into an eloquent prayer for redemption and reconciliation.(CAUTION: Dont take mom to see it on mother's day ... unless...)",

            "review_title": "A PERFECT MOVIE",
            "content": "What makes a movie perfect is not only the intensity of emotion you feel when seeing it, and it's not only the seamless matching of technique and artistry, it is the truth of feeling conveyed and the unrelenting attention to the details of the crafts of writing, acting, and directing, making certain that those details work together to create meaning - a view of life, and whatever forces are behind life, that are as varied, contradictory, and complete as a living being. It is this that Bergman managed to accomplish with AUTUMN SONATA. The hyperbolic use of the word 'perfect', too often spontaneously tossed out as a result of confused and mawkish sentimentality (just as one Liv Ulmann's interpretation of a Chopin prelude is described as mawkish in the film) has a right to be used in the case of this work. There are no demons or angels in this movie. There are a collection of remarkably real characters whose actions and their motivations are fully explained by themselves, in dialog that is explicit and direct but not delivered as an artificial way of getting across the creator's judgment on his characters. Ingrid Bergman, in what is doubtlessly the finest performance of her career, portrays a mother who has neglected her children all her life and is confronted by this fact by her grown daughter whose adoration as a child has turned into an apparently irreversible hatred. \"There is no forgiveness\" is a line uttered by Liv Ulmann after summarizing the crimes of her mother's neglect and the results of that neglect. And yet, the character's contradictory feelings are clearly seen in the moments when her need for vengeful expression of her pain has faded away. The daughter who has condemned her mother, quite honestly, wants to keep trying to resolve the conflict, to heal the gaping wounds in her heart and in her sister's heart - a sister who, arguably, has been physically crippled by the cold withdrawl of her mother's feelings and her mother's competitive need to be the leading female character in everyone's life. Ingrid Bergman's character, though seen as a villain in the emotional eyes of her daughter, comes across as complex as Ulmann's. She has an awareness of her crimes of neglect but remains helpless, by choice and by need, to confront them within herself and make amends to resolve them. Her own childhood is the reason. The isolation that she felt, instead of inspiring her to not repeat the mistake with her own children, took the course of isolation, of seeking praise from the outside, of being the central character in the lives of people around her. Her insatiable hunger for love from others, though, remains forever unsatisfied. Her selfishness, even though she is painfully aware of it, is something which she has learned how to hide from herself. Her methods, of physical distance or the perfection of her work as a pianist has, for all her adult life, successfully obfuscated her pain  - until an all-night exposing of the naked truths of hurt and distrust that are thrust upon her by her daughter.    Anyone with a mother or father can find identification with the characters in AUTUMN SONATA, as long as they can tolerate the pain of the truth that lies at the center of their all-too-human needs and the hurtful action that those needs have caused.",

            "review_title": "Bergman directs Bergman",
            "content": "Before she was an international star of incomparable charisma and beauty, and even before Ingmar Bergman became a legendary director of films bleak and intense, Ingrid Bergman played in the Swedish cinema. So it is entirely apropos that someday Bergman might direct Bergman. Ingrid plays Charlotte, a concert pianist who has, upon the recent death of her longtime lover, Leonardo, returned to her native land to visit her daughter Eva (Liv Ullmann), whom she hasn't seen for seven years, and her husband Viktor (Halvar Bjork), who is a minister. Ullmann is frumpish in specs with her hair up and her dress loose and ill-fitting. She is Ingrid's nerdish daughter who has been throughout her life entirely overshadowed by her glamorous mother. Eva has an unpleasant surprise for mom. Her other daughter, Helena (Lena Nyman), who suffers from a crippling disease, perhaps muscular dystrophy, is on hand. Eva didn't tell her mother that Helena was now living with them. She says she didn't tell her because she knew that, if she had, Charlotte would not have come. And so we can guess that there are issues that will come out, issues between mother and daughter that have been festering for decades.I got goose bumps seeing Ingrid Bergman as an elderly woman, and seeing the smooth, graceful style again, the elegant presence, a hint of the old gestures, the sly glances, the tentative smiles... It was really wonderful and at the same time disconcerting to examine her face (Sven Nykvist's intense close ups expose every inch of skin) and sigh and remember and understand the effect of the passing years. Ingrid is elegant but she has been robbed of her beauty so now we are able to see her character; unfortunately Ingmar's script allows little of the real Ingrid Bergman to appear. Hers is not a pleasant part to play. She is an entirely selfish and self-centered woman who has put her career before her family, but is unaware of what she has done. Eva seizes this opportunity to punish her mother by dredging up the neglect of her childhood to throw it in her mother's face (which perhaps explains why Charlotte hasn't been home in seven years). The sheer cold hatred that Eva expresses is enough to make the devil himself cringe. After a bit one begins to feel sorry for Charlotte, despite her failures as a mother, to have a daughter so unforgiving and so hateful.Liv Ullmann is rather startling in this portrayal, with her penetrating eyes, her hard, Neandethalish forehead, the severe specs, and the uncompromising tone of her voice. Charlotte is ashamed and begs for forgiveness and tries to defend herself, but it is no use. Eva is too strong for her. This is one of the more intense scenes in cinema, and one not easily watched. Meanwhile in the upstairs bedroom and then in the hallway and down the staircase, Helena has heard them arguing and is pulling her crippled body over the floor, desperately trying to reach them. She cries out, \"Mama! Mama!\" but is not heard.Viewers might want to pick sides between mother and daughter to say which is the more at fault. Indeed, it is hard to say who Bergman himself found more at fault. Perhaps there is no fault, only human weakness and stupidity. Such scenes are usually followed by a greater understanding, forgiveness and a willingness to start anew. However, although Charlotte wants that, it is not clear in Bergman's script that anything good will come of what has happened. Charlotte leaves, the minister returns to looking at his wife, (having overheard the argument, about which he has said nothing) and Eva writes a letter to her mother. It is not clear whether she wants to patch things up or to gain another opportunity to pick her mother to pieces. The viewer is left to decide.Perhaps the best scene in the film is the one that follows dinner the night of Charlotte's arrival in which Eva plays the piano, a Chopin prelude. She has worked hard on it and hopes to please her mother. Alas, her play is not so good. After all, the mother is a genius, the daughter only the daughter of a genius. Charlotte sits down next to Eva and takes the keys to gently demonstrate how the piece should be played. We see and feel at once the inadequacy of the daughter in her mother's eyes. It is a great scene filmed with a tight focus on the faces of the two women. When Eva turns to stare at her mother, who is, of course, playing brilliantly with great finesse and touch, the expression on Eva's face, held for many long seconds, is unforgettable.Not to second guess the master, but I would have liked to have seen the entire movie played in this, a more subtle key than that which followed. However when it comes to dysfunction and disease, Ingmar Bergman is unrestrained.Ingrid Bergman was nominated for an academy award for best actress in this, her last feature film (she had already been diagnosed with cancer), but lost out to Jane Fonda in Coming Home (1978).(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

            "content": "PLEASE NOTE: This Ingmar Bergman movie starred Ingrid Bergman--it's easy to confuse the two when reading a review!Unlike some Ingmar Bergman movies that focus on despair and hopelessness, this movie focuses on pain but does not necessarily leave the viewer with the same level of hopelessness they might feel after watching Persona or Through a Glass Darkly. These two films, I fear, are SO dark and depressing I could see them pushing a severely depressed person to suicide! Instead, this is a movie about unresolved anger and depression--not death and oblivion. For an Ingmar Bergman film, this is awfully upbeat! Ingrid Bergman plays an older woman who has spent most of her life traveling as a concert pianist--leaving her 2 daughters and husband at home most all the time. As a result, the depth of the relationship between her and her family is strained to say the least, but it apparently NEVER was talked about--just swept under the rug. Liv Ullmann is her older daughter who invites her to stay with her and her husband after Ingrid's longtime companion dies (what happened to Dad isn't too clear--it seems implied he had died many years earlier).The first monkey wrench is thrown into the story when Liv tells her mom that Liv's younger sister now lives with them and not the institution where she had been placed many years before. It seems this woman is severely physically disabled and she has great difficulty taking or caring for herself. Ingrid's reaction is strange, to say the least. She is ANGRY she was not told that her younger daughter was there--it seems her way of coping with this disabled child was by having her \"put away\" years earlier. Reluctantly, she pretends to like seeing this woman when they meet again. She puts on a good act, but it's disturbing to see this indifference towards her own daughter.Later that night, Ingrid wakes and goes to the kitchen. Liv is there as well and so they begin talking, while they have a bit of wine. As Liv drinks more and more wine, she begins to reveal more and more of her hidden hurt and rage towards her mother. Ingrid tries to explain herself, make excuses and even apologize throughout, but Liv is on a roll! YEARS of a physically and emotionally absent mother all come pouring out in their full intensity! It's ugly but sounds so real. Ullmann's performance during these scenes is EXTRAORDINARY--brilliant, real and heartbreaking. Although Ingrid Bergman got a lot of attention (she WAS the ultra-famous actress starring in her last movie, apart from a made for television movie), the show was easily stolen by Ullmann, though Bergman was excellent as well.The next day, Ingrid cuts her extended stay short and leaves. Later, Ullmann writes a letter to her mother and retracts most of what she said! This isn't very satisfying, but when I was a therapist, I saw this type reaction many times.This movie would be excellent for anyone but particularly for adult children dealing with abandonment issues. Ingmar Bergman does a masterful, though painful job.PS--it is ODD that Ingrid Bergman would play this role, as in real life she, too, abandoned her kids to carry on the famous affair that pretty much ruined her career in the 1950s. Perhaps this was therapeutic and I admire her candor for doing such a role.NOTE: Since writing this review, I have seen at least a dozen more movies by Ingmar Bergman. I still consider this to one of his greatest creations. A highly under-rated film.",

This may sound over the top and rather florid but is a genuine statement.

However intense, the issues are too small, excepting `Seventh Seal.'But his is a cinematic mind, and every once in a while, he'll create an image so powerful it burns its way into the depths of your memory, slightly below that threshold of awareness. You then carry it always.This film has one such scene. It involves a Chopin Prelude.\nChopin's work is unlike any other composer's: it is designed to be played in a way that deviates from the expected with the passion coming not from the notes per se, but the space between them, and between them and us that when filled affects the placement of the notes in time ever so slightly.This particular prelude can range from one that haunts to one that accuses. I've heard all sorts of different passions, depending on who plays and how rich they are as humans. There is nothing in all the world like the many ways this can be filled and the impact it can have when taken seriously.The scene in question is superficially simple: the daughter plays the piece rather poorly, followed by the mother much more expertly. But the pianist who actually plays (Laretei) really knows his way around this world, and was expertly directed by Bergman. Watch the scene, and you'll hear the piece played by Eva in a way that expertly expresses the damage, perverted love, and sly literateness of her character. Then we have a speech from her Mom about wrestling with it, about being emotional but not mawkish, feeling not being sentimentality, pain and not reverie, to be calm clear and harsh, to not show the hurt, to be restrained.And then she plays, and does everything she says not to. Everything. Rather than hinting at yogic control of immense suffering, she creates the reverse notion. Rather than phrasing in the small, she does it in the large with hesitations not anticipations. In other words, she acts through the music in precisely the same way her character does in the film. But the music is far richer than can be accomplished with talk.And Liv! She watches her mother go through this, feeling the metapain of her mother: the pain of not knowing why her pain isn't genuine, and tapping the metapain for the performance. It's an exploitation of cluelessness. Eva recognizes this and it scrambles her soul without her really knowing why. It is a few minutes of the most concentrated emotion you may ever experience in film. Everything that follows is annotation, including Eva's awareness and Charlotte's noting of Leonardo's remark to her: `a sense of reality is a matter of talent.'I've watched a few thousand films, many about music. Almost never does the filmmaker understand the music. This does. She does. He does.Ted's evaluation: 3 of 4 -- Worth watching.",

            "content": "Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman strikes such a deep, tragic chord with movie-fans that he's impossible to dismiss, though not always easy to like. \"Autumn Sonata\" is admirable and emotional, and the characters aren't so far removed from most of us that we can't relate to them, but it's a lugubrious piece with heavy, thudding sequences. I recognized many of the tumultuous emotions in the two women at the heart of this story; one particular scene, where Liv Ullmann stares off into space as domineering mother Ingrid Bergman plays the piano, is shiveringly real. It's the director's gift to bring out the cold loneliness of living, and yet keep it structured in an intimate setting between lovers or family members. It isn't the tour-de-force many professional critics hailed it as, however the performances are terrific and the central relationship between mother and daughter is tremulous and fascinating. **1/2 from ****",

            "content": "Autumn Sonata, as it is stated on the commentary on the DVD, plays like a real sonata where it starts slow, builds to a high peak, and then descends in its finale. If the film might not be one of Bergman's most striking or overwhelming feats visually his script provides for its stars some of their best work. In some circles the combination of Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullmann might be comparable to the incredible stature of Pacino and De Niro in Heat; you almost might think who will top who in their given role going into it. While some have put more credit to the late Ingrid for her role as Charlotte the absentee piano master mother, and she does deserve as much credit here as she does for her more well-known work from the 40s, Ullmann as usual connects so strongly and passionately with the material that it could rank as one of her very best in her collaboration with Mr. Bergman. And there is, per usual with the director's work, this need to tell this story of these characters who are damaged and in a disconnected pain with one another that is hidden until it finally has to come pouring out with an everlasting effect on both sides. If Strindberg did Lifetime, this would be it.But what's interesting, as well as comparatively with the bulk of the film slightly underwhelming, are a couple of the early scenes as the mother talks to herself (of course, as in theater, for the audience's benefit) and the subtle touches of the already felt strain in the mother/daughter relationship. There are some words from Ullmann's husband as well, but his function in the film is more as sorrowful observer. Also there is the most devastating character of the ill girl Lena who has become worse over the years. Then, in the middle of the night, the confrontation- and really confessional- from daughter to mother comes out, and it is really the kind of despairingly, bitter but completely honest drama that could only be palatable from this director, from these actors who believe in the characters this much.While there are many a sad, crushing moment in these twenty to thirty minutes of this hidden, terrible lot of anguish from the daughter to the stunned and crushed mother, maybe my favorite scene of the film is also one of the subtler ones and tells a great deal about their relationship. Bergman shows her daughter how to play a Chopin piece after she plays it in a way that isn't totally emotionally correct for her. Both times the piece is played the camera stays totally on the one listening to the other playing, and each actress says so much without saying anything at all- Bergman with disconcerting, judging eyes and minor expressions, and then Ullmann who looks on complacently, still, almost numb to what is going on. And the musical piece itself has a level of significance (considering its maybe one of the only pieces of music heard in an otherwise dialog-centric picture) that adds some weight to the material.If it might not be as exceptional as, for example, Bergman's Scenes From a Marriage, it may be because Bergman is aiming a little smaller and with a more concentrated, shorter view of these people in 90 minutes. But even if it isn't one of his very best films, it is one of his more memorable ones at sticking a totally theatrical tone with the script while also keeping tight, enclosing close-ups on his actors. And probably a few of the points must go to the players themselves, whom have a challenge in the way of their characters not having at all a simple 'hear-to-heart', and without an ending that makes everything clear. Autumn Sonata shows heartbroken characters, and it's not as easy to take as a run-of-the-mill drama or play.",

            "content": "After 1978, when Autumn Sonata was released, the rest of Ingmar Bergman's output were all TV dramas. So why was this one filmed for the silver screen instead of TV, given the surfeit of dialogue and lack of more visual cues throughout the narrative? This is perhaps the biggest criticism surrounding Autumn Sonata as filmgoers complained that this venture seemed much better suited to the stage or TV than a feature film.Nonetheless, the performances of Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullmann are so great that one doesn't mind all the \"talk\"-the dialogue, laden with profound ideas chronicling a mother-daughter relationship, simply hits the mark.Ingrid Bergman (in her final film role) plays Charlotte Andergast, a wildly successful concert pianist and mother to Eva (Liv Ullman), wife of a Swedish village pastor. Charlotte accepts her daughter's invitation to visit after having not seen her in seven years.Of the two characters, I found Charlotte to be the more interesting. Who hasn't met people like Charlotte who put much more of a priority on their career than their child-rearing duties? Following the superficial pleasantries when Andergast arrives and begins spending time with Eva, terrible recriminations on Eva's part soon emerge. Her mother's being away on concert tours, and not paying enough attention to Eva when she was growing up, turns out to be one of the major bones of contention Eva brings up.But even when Charlotte was home (sometimes laid up with back problems), Eva notes that she was so emotionally distant that nothing she said or did gave Eva any kind of comfort. Charlotte eventually confesses that she was distant and blames a lack of nurturance in her own childhood.Still the major question remains is whether Eva is justified in \"going off\" on her mother. With a \"normal\" person, blaming one's parents while well into adulthood only serves to sabotage whatever good will and trust has been built up over the years, despite any hidden resentments that continue to linger.But Eva's situation is hardly \"normal.\" First of all, she lost her four year old son Erik a few years earlier in a drowning accident. Ironically, it's her husband Viktor (Halver Bjork) who still hasn't gotten over the child's death-he doesn't exactly understand why Eva feels Erik is still alive (she speaks about communing with him) but respects her life-affirming stance.A larger source of resentment is the presence of Eva's sister Helena (Lena Nyman), severely handicapped due to an unnamed illness. When she first arrives, Charlotte is upset to hear from Eva that she took Helena out of a nursing facility (where Charlotte initially placed her) and brought her to live with her and her husband.Should one blame Charlotte as her daughter did? Certainly Eva's self-sacrifice in taking care of her sister was extremely admirable. And Charlotte even goes so far as remarking that she wished Helena would have died earlier-presumably so she would not be suffering so much as she does in the present.Was Charlotte simply cold-hearted? Perhaps but things are not so simple. One of the great scenes in the film is when Charlotte describes how to play a particular Chopin prelude. You can tell her knowledge of music is way ahead of the average person-and something must be said about those who have a creative spark and bring joy to others through the love of music.Charlotte is clearly taken aback by Eva's diatribe. It appears she has an epiphany that indeed she was \"clueless\" as to how she treated Eva while she was growing up and goes so far as to beg forgiveness of her daughter. It is sad and tragic that Eva can't forgive her in the moment but understandable given the aforementioned extremely difficult life Eva had.Indeed in the end Charlotte confesses that she was a failure as a mother. After she leaves, Eva has a change of heart perhaps after getting everything off her chest. She writes a letter begging her mother's forgiveness. It's uncertain whether Charlotte will receive and even read the letter. Has she written Eva off after taking things to heart or does she realize Eva's outburst had to come out no matter what?Autumn Sonata is a meditation on our upbringing. Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman give magisterial performances under the direction of Ingmar Bergman, the Shakespeare of the silver screen.",

A hatred she doesn't understand, somewhere inside being a child needing attention herself. The tension between mother and daughter is building up, at first it is jolly but soon we see cracks in the surface of both Ingrid Bergman's glamorous Charlotte and Liv Ullman's quiet and suppressed Eva.\"H\u00f6stsonaten\" is beautiful, but it takes its toll on the viewer. If you aren't prepared for it, it can be an emotional roller coaster ride that leaves you chocked when its over.

Helena has a degenerative disease. Initially, the mood between Eva and her mother is cordial but soon long-held bitternesses and resentments rise to the surface.I tend to find Ingmar Bergman's films a bit hit and miss, largely reliant on them finding an aspect you can relate to or a hook to get you engaged or even what mood you're in when you watch them. I thought 'Wild Strawberries' was brilliant, largely because it explored themes I could relate to in my own life. 'Persona' was unfathomable, yet brilliant due to its themes within the unfathomability and its pure artistry. On the other hand, 'The Seventh Seal', another symbolism-laden one, seemed more style than substance and 'Fanny and Alexander' was long-winded and dull.All of these are highly rated and critically acclaimed movies yet some worked for me, some didn't. So I was intrigued to see how I would find 'Autumn Sonata'.Initially I wasn't overly impressed. The first half of the movie isn't bad, there is a reasonable degree of engagement with the characters and Bergman's camerawork absolutely shines in some scenes. However, there just doesn't seem any point to proceedings. Everything just seems to drift along and it appears that the film will be one of those \"day in the life\" sort of films where you get to meet some people, follow their lives for a day or so and that's it.However, just when I was starting to lose patience, Bergman shifts up several gears. The seemingly placid relationship between Eva and her mother suddenly turns more antagonistic and events and secrets from the past are revealed. From a drifting \"all about the journey\" film the movie shifts to a searing, emotional examination of relationships, skewed priorities, family and grace.Quite a superb change-up by Bergman, showing why the seemingly aimless set-up was necessary. He is aided by superb performances by Ingrid Bergman as Charlotte and Liv Ullmann as Eva. Ingrid Bergman is great and got an Oscar nomination for Best Leading Actress for her efforts but for me it is Ullmann's performance that steals the show. Combining intensity and passiveness, anger and grace she demonstrates an incredible range and perfectly rams the point home at the end. Some of the scenes between Bergman and Ullmann are incredibly emotional yet often involve very little or no dialogue, such are their acting abilities and is Ingmar Bergman's deft use of the camera.Lena Hyman is also excellent as the semi-mute, semi-paralysed Helena, a very difficult and demanding role.Overall, a wonderfully engaging, emotional and profound drama.",

Charlotte's other daughter, Helena, is also living with Eva.  Helena has a crippling disease, and at one time was living in some type of institution.At first, everything is fine, as mother and daughter do their best to make each other as comfortable as possible.  When left alone, they wonder about each other's expectations, but continue on.Charlotte is a very talented, but completely self-absorbed woman.  Eva is a frump.  A sweet frump, but a frump nonetheless.  At first, there are a few catty remarks exchanged, but the turning point is when Eva offers to play the piano for her mother.  She works as hard as she can, but the music sounds contrived and unmusical.  When she asks her mother to play the piece for her, Charlotte does the one thing that signaled to me that \"the war was on\".  She laid down the music rack on the piano.  (When pianists have a piece memorized, they do that to show the audience that they have no need for the printed music.)  Charlotte, of course, plays beautifully (she could play no other way).  However, the damage is done.  Mother is successful, and daughter is a failure.  Although the scene is dramatically pivotal, it did produce one of the few really funny lines in the movie.  After Charlotte finishes playing, she says, \"Well, I HAVE been playing these Chopin pieces for 37 years.\"Charlotte's self-absorption is pretty amazing when you realize that her ill daughter was in an institution, then moved to Eva's house, and she had no idea that it happened.  There are some other clues in the early part of the story that indicate she probably wished that her daughter Helena would have died long ago.  Charlotte can be totally charming to her public, her agents, her fans... but has very little to offer her own children.Eva is so desperate for love and affection from her mother that she seemingly misses the fact that her husband loves her very much.  When Charlotte is awakened by a nightmare, she and Eva begin a late-night talk. And that is when the real nightmare begins.At times this film is painful to watch, and at times is emotionally draining.  Sven Nykvyst's cinematography is stunning.  I thought this especially so in the flashback sequences, and in the scene close to the end of the film when Eva is in the cemetery.Although not as perfect as The Seventh Seal, or Wild Strawberries, Autumn Sonata still has much to say, whether we feel comfortable listening to it or not.",

There is a second daughter who is suffering from a debilitating illness (Muscular Dystrophy perhaps). She is dying and in great pain. The mother can't bear to be around her. The movie reaches its apex when, in a typical Ingmar Bergman moment, Ingrid is forced with facing the music as the daughter lays the blame on her for everything that she has had to deal with during her life. It's not a bad life, but it is missing passion; it is missing a loving mother's nurturing.

Both of the films relied on a deep examination of the family, and the interpersonal relationships of relatives. Allen's film used extreme close-ups to better submerge the audience in the narrative, and Bergman's film used the close-up on a character as they delivered a monologue that I have seen in a few of his films during this project.

            "content": "\"Autumn Sonata\" is probably the most emotionally draining and exhausting film I've ever seen. It stars Liv and Ingrid Bergman in what must be described as a tour de force for both women. Ingmar Bergman here studies the complex relationship between a mother and daughter, and it's something that many of us can relate to.The lovely Eva (Ullmann), here a plain parson's wife, invites her recently widowed (perhaps by a second husband) mother Charlotte (Bergman) to visit. When her mother arrives, we see immediately that Charlotte is a vibrant, glamorous woman with a busy life - very different from her daughter. When Eva mentions that her handicapped sister Lena, removed from a care facility, is now living with her and her husband, Charlotte freezes up. It's obvious that she wouldn't be there had she known. When Eva speaks of her dead son, who drowned as a small boy, Charlotte says that during that time, she was recording the Mozart sonatas. She is uncomfortable when Eva tells her that her little boy Erik is still with her in spirit.Bottom line: Charlotte is a self-involved, cold woman who gave birth to a mediocre daughter and a sick one, and she'd rather forget the whole thing. Eva, of course, keeps trying to win her mother's love. Finally, one night, the two have it out in a long, stunning series of scenes that leave the viewer gasping for air.This is one of the most brilliant films I have ever seen, with performances unsurpassed by anyone. Both Ullmann and Bergman give amazing portrayals of complex women with a difficult history between them. Ingrid Bergman was such a great treasure, and here she caps off her prolific, wonderful film career with her finest work. Ullmann again proves why she is a favorite actress of Bergman - her face pinched and pained, holding herself together with a paper clip as she sobs that her mother could never accept her as she was, a woman living with the pain of just not being good enough.What is it about these Swedish actresses - Garbo, Ullmann, Bergman - that they can plunge such a dagger in the heart - is it something in their culture that allows such depth of emotion - I don't know. I just know I'll never forget the impact of this amazing film.",

This is not intelligent enough for you.Fans of TV soap operas, you should give this one a try.This time, Bergman's script is nothing less than exhilarating. The story is absolutely amazing.Ingrid visits her daughter Liv. They talk. Liv's cripple sister, Lena, appears. Ingrid talks to Lena. Ingrid talks to herself. Liv talks to her husband. They talk to Ingrid. Liv plays the piano. Ingrid plays the piano. Liv and Ingrid talk. And they talk. Flashbacks. After a while they talk more. Flashbacks. And guess what? They talk again. And again. Flashbacks. Lena screams. Liv narrates, thinking about suicide. Ingrid on a train, happy to finally leave the movie. Liv narrates more. Guess how the movie ends? Liv talks. To the camera, this time. She has bored Ingrid so much that the cameraman was the only person left to talk to at the end.If your idea of fun is to watch a mother and a daughter \"confront their inner demons and their troubled past\" (as some critics would probably put it), then you'll enjoy this piece of crap. A soap opera, nothing more, but with better dialog. Except that this time around the acting is worse than usual. Liv is unconvincing; screaming and tamper-tantrums do not necessarily good acting make. Ingrid is a little better, but she completely destroys the illusion she creates of being a good actress when we hear her speaking English in 3-4 scenes. It is when we hear English spoken here that we get a glimpse into how much worse Bergman films would sound if they were in a language we could understand. As it is, Bergman, quite wisely, hides behind Swedish (he could have easily made more English-speaking movies). When we hear Ingrid in Swedish we don't notice how silly some of the dialog really is. I mean, it's still silly, but not as silly as when you can actually understand it directly.This oppressive, overwrought drama has all the Bergman traits: flashbacks, marathon dialogs, marathon monologues, reddish/brown colours that dominate, unresolved issues between family members, shouting, misery, wretchedness \u2013 and even a crippled person this time. I've always considered it a very cheap dramatic shtick to put a crippled person into the story, sort of under the motto \"if I can't get 'em to cry with the other stuff, surely a cripple will get the tears rolling\". Check out the truly pathetic scene when Lena is crawling on the floor, shouting \"Mama!\". I mean, it's so damn manipulative that it can only work with uncritical or inexperienced viewers.Plot-wise, Bergman really lays on the misery. Not only is Liv scarred for life by her mother's cold behaviour, but she also has a cripple sister. And her health has been worsening steadily for years. And Liv thinks about suicide. And she and her husband couldn't have children for a long time. And if you think that was enough for Bergman, you're wrong: you see, Liv eventually gave birth to a son, but alas, he's dead. And he was just a child, of course, when he died. Of course. So basically, the only disaster Bergman didn't include was the sky falling on everyone's collective heads.I found it rather pretentious (you can't have a(n honest) Bergman review without this word) how Bergman keeps throwing in all those names of classical composers, and their works. It's sort of his way of saying, \"see? I listen to classical music, and these are my favourite pieces of it\". As if anyone cares what he listens to. You're an educated, cultured ex-Nazi, we get it.There is an endless scene with Liv and Ingrid that lasts about 20 minutes (if I'm not mistaken). If you survive that, you can watch any of his other movies. (Except \"The Silence\"; that will test even the most boredom-immune viewer.) The melodious, soft-as-a-bird's-beak Swedish language lends audio beauty to this visual feast. The sound coming out of these actors' mouths are like music to my ears...If you are unhappy with \"Autumn Sonata\", which you must be, just google \"Vjetropev Bergman Spoofs\" and this will lead you to my video clips with the vastly improved movie.

It deals with the tension between a neglected daughter and self-centred mother with his poetic style, but also with a personal familiarity that makes the whole film hit a slightly different nerve. I know people who've had to cope with similar circumstances, and their experiences were represented boldly, without the watering down or trivialisation that you'd expect from something from the past 15 years.There is one quite brief scene in this film that makes the whole thing worth watching multiple times. I count it as some of Ingmar Bergman's best writing.Eva plays for her professional pianist mother Charlotte one of Chopin's preludes she had been practicing for some time. Whilst playing her mistakes and stiffness sets a tense tone, as Charlotte is a critical and inconsiderate nightmare of a mother, who at any minute would burst out with a cutting criticism. She instead begins a monologue about Chopin's music, blending together her experiences of playing his piano music, as well as the emotions he evokes. Chopin's emotional strength is not sentimental, she says. It's far more credibly affecting than music designed to be manipulative. This begins the downward spiral of the two characters' immediate relationship. It speaks to each of the characters, their style of playing representative of their emotional makeup. Charlotte's aversion or ignorance towards affection is displayed clearly. It also plays on another level, which I found the most resounding. Bergman's films always deal with heavy emotions, but they are never sentimental. They never dress emotions up to be more affecting for the audience than they are for the characters. This honesty in the way he makes films is explored in Charlotte's speech, I see him speaking to us, saying that he tries hard not to be fake. Not to manipulate us in cheap ways that don't exist in the real world.Bergman is a great director. Autumn Sonata reminded me that at the heart of his talent is his powerful writing. I don't think we'll see a finer writer and director for actresses for a long time to come.",

Returning home forces her and her daughter Eva (Liv Ullmann) to reconcile while at the same time facing problems that their family has had.Film buffs know that Ingmar Bergman is one director who doesn't insult his audience's intelligence. With this movie he goes deep into the issues that have dominated this family, and how they're bound to play out. I haven't seen most of Bergman's movies, so I can't compare this to them, but I can say that it's one of the most profound and complex stories ever put to film.

            "content": "I could hardly stand the disturbing feeling of intimacy between Charlotte, the mother, and Eva, the daughter. \"Autumn Sonata\" is so real that it almost fails as a film for a more transcending merit that goes as far as your soul can reach. I don't know how to express it, the movie left me speechless, torn between the guilt from witnessing such heart-breaking displays of hatred on an almost voyeuristic level, or a strange feeling of fascination. Ingmar Bergman's \"Autumn Sonata\" is the cinematic demonstration that family is indeed the reservoir of all our repressed feelings, emotions, the source or the obstacle to our own life-guiding energies. The flute sound that introduces the film has a rustic serenity resonating like the appeasing lullaby for our worried minds. The quietness of a little house far from the town, Eva, not beautiful, hardly pretty, is embodying the austerity of her environment in a chameleonic way. Liv Ullman, Ingmar Bergman's muse, is again totally mesmerizing in a role that proves her immense versatility, but wait till you see Ingrid Bergman, in one of the greatest female performances ever, rightfully Oscar-nominated. When she makes her entrance, the whole place is inhabited by a shining aura. As Charlotte, Ingrid Bergman's charisma cancels out the apparent dullness of Eva and her insignificant husband. Charlotte is the authoritarian guiding force of the story, and our eyes follow her, secretly wishing that she would be the one to awaken Eva. But don't expect THAT awakening.The movie is an eye-opening experience, proving how the relationships with parents are children's cement to build their personality. Parents either enlighten your soul, or make you live in their shadows. I remember a line from \"The Godfather Part II\" where Fredo wished he could be like his father, a man with power, with a loving family, Michael had these words: \"It's not easy being a son\" Oh God, how right he was. When the mere idea to be better than your father is intolerable, the least you can do, is to please him. We all put some people on a personal pedestal, and \"Autumn Sonata\" talked to my soul through the story of a daughter whose ego was dwarfed by her mother's undeniable aura.The contrast between Charlotte and Eva, in beauty, colors and personality echoed my own contrast with the person I respect the most in that world, and I guess this is the reason why I'm so disturbed, because I can't even dare to imagine the pain he indirectly caused me, not because of him but because of the way I perceived him. But how can I blame him for my own perceptions? Or aren't the perceptions in fine inspired by a certain behavior? My empathy for Eva was so omnipresent that it perverted any possibility to rationally judge the film, with that reserve I admire so much from Northern cultures, and that has been so wrongly associated with coldness. But relating to Eva isn't saying much, because ironically, Charlotte was the character I respected the most. call it the 'Eva' of 'Fredo' syndrome.Ingmar Bergman's most unique talent is to convey universal feelings through simple shots, looks, or a specific use of music. Here, music plays a significant role as it highlights the talent of Charlotte, a virtuoso concert pianist, to play with emotions, to fake or overact them, and it lures us into the conviction that she used that talent even with her daughter and late husband. Eva's talent is more debatable, her mother reproaches that she plays it too sentimental, without passion, which are two separate things. Indeed, Eva seems passionless, and Charlotte, with her bright red dress is the quintessential lively old woman. But we know this is prefabricated, we know Charlotte's personality is only a cover while Eva simply fears to contradict her mother. There's one scene where Charlotte sobs while remembering her lover's death then she pulls herself together as if there was a natural weakness in grief. Ironically, Eva mourned during her whole life an inexistent childhood caused by a mother she loved despite everything.And progressively, the film reveals the complexity of Eva's torment and by drinking some red wine, like draining a sort of Charlotte-like force in her heart; she gains enough confidence for the ultimate confrontation with Charlotte. The slow pacing of the first act was simply the patient build-up until an exhausting but so emotionally rewarding climax, paralleled with Eva's long waiting before she could find the strength to open her heart. And then, Eva like drunk by the exquisite delight of having the last word, bluntly tells the truth right in the face of Charlotte, taking so many years off it. The devastated face of Charlotte immediately contrasted with Eva's confident eyes, Eva, almost embellished by her new confidence.Incapable to react to such hatred, she's hopelessly taking every emotional hits, realizing how responsible she is for her daughter's sadness, but maybe even sadder that she didn't realize it before. Yet, the ambiguity of the film relies on this strange impression that each character plays against the words, as said Liv Ullman in an interview, one of the first disagreement in Bergman's careers was when Ingrid refused to say 'hold me' after getting so many insults, when her instinctive reaction would've been to slap her daughter in the face, and being a woman, she probably knew better than Ingmar in that department.And indeed, she says 'hold me', but her eyes keep a dignity, while the real slap in the face is that masterpiece of austere realism, but even more poignant and heart-breaking as I dare anyone not to relate to it. Each family is built on dreams of stability and happiness but we all have our shameful secrets, our lies, our Oedipian feelings that can poison our entire existence. Watching \"Autumn Sonata\" is like an antidote against that poison.",

            "content": "Watching an Ingmar Bergman picture is a therapeutic experience for a film lover. It just makes you go 'Ahhhhh'. There may not have been a director ever before or since so fundamentally accomplished in both the arts of literature and cinema.Ingmar, however, is not the biggest Bergman in \"Autumn Sonata\". The spotlight is on Ingrid Bergman (no relation), playing an aging concert pianist who returns to Sweden in an attempt to reconnect with her family. Liv Ullman co-stars as her daughter, running a household for her husband (Halvar Bj\u00f6rk) and ill sister (Lena Nyman). All remembrances are happy when her mother arrives, but over the course of an evening and a night, the family's wounds are exposed with relentless incisiveness.This was Ingrid Bergman's final theatrical appearance, at age 63 as beautiful as she has ever been. She captures with sublime grace the lonely old woman who has never been able to love. Even her more archaic mannerisms (those fearful, knowing glances!) are etched into her character's affectations by Ingmar's keen sense of behaviour. Her performance rightfully garnered her an Oscar nomination, although she lost to Jane Fonda.In a more subdued performance, Liv Ullman easily matches Bergman. Her emotional shading is pitch perfect. From her first seconds on screen we see the pain behind her content fa\u00e7ade -- the scars she carries from the past, her struggle to keep on living. And when the tension finally boils over, her great emotional outburst is one of the most shattering in film. She might have been nominated for an Oscar too if she had ever acted opposite Humphrey Bogart.Despite their individual greatness, however, it ought to be acknowledged what these ladies owe to Sven Nykvist, who will appear on the top half of any credible list of greatest cinematographers of all time. Even in his well-filled crown, \"Autumn Sonata\" is a jewel. His typical willingness to light faces with a single source in close-ups draws every drop of expression from the actors, and his \u00d4zu-like frames within frames create a particularly cinematic sense of distance. I would like to say they don't make 'em like this anymore, but his work is without match in any era.And then there is Bergman himself, an artist's artist. As a writer he is in great form -- \"Autumn Sonata\" is stocked with the subtle dialogue and human insight we expect from him, -- but as a director his footing seems less certain than usual.\"Autumn Sonata\" (1978) is notable for being a transitional work in Bergman's oeuvre. Its tight and confrontational script firmly recalls the stark, sinewy cinema of \"Through a Glass Darkly\" (1961), whilst the pleasant entourage and dream-like flashbacks foreshadow the luxurious fairy-tale world of \"Fanny and Alexander\" (1982). Perhaps due to a changing mindset, scenes belonging to either aesthetic opposite at times sit awkwardly beside each other.The aforementioned flashbacks are a particularly strange case. Inserted during monologues, they seem a device from a lesser picture. 'Tell, don't show' was after all a Bergman speciality. His films contain some of the greatest monologues of all time, from Alma's graphic account of sex on the beach in \"Persona\" to Isak Jacobi's 7-minute story in \"Fanny and Alexander\". Their long takes are hypnotising; their words so evocative you leave thinking you were there yourself. But the visual intervention here breaks the spell, and prevents \"Autumn Sonata\" from reaching the exalted level of Bergman's best work.Still, an haute cuisine dish presented in a slightly awkward manner remains preferrable to the greasy garbage sold around the corner. Despite its imperfections, \"Autumn Sonata\" seeps from every pore with sublime artistry, and its placement in the IMDb Top 250 indicates at least a certain accessibility. So when in the mood, shed off your mainstream robes and slip into this hot bath of trademark Swedish misery.",

            "content": "It is Ingrid Bergman's big screen swan song and the two renowned Bergman compatriots' one and only collaboration. Charlotte Andergast (Bergman) is a renowned pianist who recently lost her companion Leonardo (L\u00f8kkeberg), so she accepts the invitation to stay with her eldest daughter Eva (Liv Ullmann) and her husband Viktor (Bj\u00f6rk) for some time, whom she hasn't seen for seven years.This highly nerve-wracking chamber drama begins with Viktor's breaking-the-fourth-wall monologue about him and Eva's temporal life, he is a minister and how they are united under the guidance of the parish work. Then Eva brings him the letter she writes to invite Charlotte, at first impression, Eva is a tender, self-effacing and soft-spoken woman. Only when Charlotte arrives, who is presumably a self-centered artist with elegance, a vivacious but neglectful mother, garrulous about the last days of Leonardo, puts on a strong patina of being high spirited and after the initial and necessary pleasantry, Eva throws the first bomb, she tells her Helena (Nyman), Charlotte's bed-ridden, mentally disabled younger daughter, is also here, whom Charlotte puts in a health institution for years, but now she has been under the attendance of Eva for two years. The mother-daughters reunion proceeds into a rather awkward situation, as Charlotte is more than unwillingly to face her ill daughter, which clearly evokes her guilty conscience for being absent most of the time. After dinner, a turbulent undercurrent is grafted on Charlotte's professional advice on Eva's piano skill, from Eva's angle, she never quite inherit any merits from her mother, neither the look or the talent. This is one of the main reason of their clash, under her vulnerable mien, she is in hopeless anguish. After an interlude about the premature death of Viktor and Eva's four-year- old son and a t\u00eate-a-t\u00eate between Viktor and Charlotte (during which Viktor refers that Eva is incapable of love), in the still of the night, Charlotte is awaken from a nightmare, Eva hears the noise and they embark on a thorough heart-to-heart two-hander, Eva divulges all her unhappy childhood memories and attributes it to Charlotte's career-first option; while Charlotte tries to justify the story from her side, but in no avail, both actresses' performances are sparklingly galvanizing, Ullmann is fearlessly aggressive, arbitrarily unforgiving, while Bergman refutes with a tour-de-force achievement, unyieldingly emits compassionate remorse and unexpected perplexity. Both actresses competently consummate their characters' emotional arcs, which is undeniably enthralling to watch, even for those who don't feel comfortable in Bergman's school. Personally I will give the edge to Bergman, considering her the harsh similarities between the role and her legendary personal life, and it is a stupendous curtain call for her illustrious career, although I impulsively think this performance is her career-best. The bond between a mother and a daughter often comes off as an amalgam of love and hatred, AUTUMN SONATA is at its best to dissect the relationship in dialectics, there is no right or wrong in the story, firstly, viewers is prone to cold-shoulder Charlotte's self-seeking pretentiousness, her failure in motherhood, but, when Eva's anger is fully emancipated, her one-sided blame- shooting accusation is also defectively biased, Ingmar Bergman is a true maestro in concocting this kind of brutal revelation of human being's deep-rooted character deficiency, it is not a parable, it is just a real life situation may occur to many others, unfortunately this time one might also sense a tint of misogyny. In the end, there is no sign of reconciliation despite Eva writes an apologetic letter, which Charlotte may or may not receive, the whole mess cannot save them from their respective mental condition, leastwise, they know each other better afterward, the scar may never be healed and truth hurts, yet everyone of us is living with both pain and happiness, simultaneously, as long as we come to terms with that, we will be fine.",

Apart from a few early pieces I hadn't seen any Bergman til I borrowed Fanny and Alexander from the library a couple of weeks ago. Although I found it ridiculously long for the story it had to tell there was still enough craftsmanship on display to try another. Of course the Second Bergman was a major selling point here and she didn't disappoint. This is very much a two-hander despite two other fine contributions and both Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman excel. It's fascinating to speculate that Ullman, realising that the camera would show the ageing Bergman warts and all, elected to play down her own beauty and appear dowdy with hair drab and lifeless, ugly glasses, etc, in the interests of making it a fair fight, a straight head-to-head of two of the finest actresses in the business. After years of seeing Bergman suffering nobly, loving the wrong men, etc, to say nothing of a nice line in nuns and missionaries, it's a change to see her take on the Selfish Mother From Hell who sacrificed family and (presumably) friends on the altar of her international career as a concert pianist. Now it's payback time and Ullman ensures that Mama faces up to her faults. Twice in a row now I've seen late Bergman movies in which he seems to underplay the subtlety and stack the deck as he does here. It's not enough that Bergman has neglected ONE daughter, Ullman, who, as it happens, has lucked in to a saintly husband who can and does offer the unconditional love that Bergman withheld and/or lavished on the Steinway instead; no, there must be a SECOND daughter, now little more than a vegetable who Bergman, in her wisdom and/or selfishness, consigned to a Nursing Home and who Ullman has removed and brought to live with her and hubby, as if to say to Bergman, 'look, Mama, THIS is how you do it'. Apart from flaws like these this remains a record of two really great performances.",

There is an undercurrent of restless tension & hint of an undisclosed trauma detectable in the mother-daughter relationship from the very moment they meet, and it slowly builds towards the scene where it finally spills out.The early monologues, poems & neurotic ramblings during the first half can get on nerves at times but once the daughter's pent-up feelings boil to surface, the drama only intensifies from that point onwards. Both Ingrid Bergman & Liv Ullmann chip in with powerhouse performances, with Bergman edging out Ullmann by the tiniest of margins in what's her final film role. They are outstanding individually and are even better when sharing the space.Overall, Autumn Sonata is a powerful & punishing story of childhood trauma & adult insecurities that presents Ingmar Bergman in splendid form and also covers themes of fame, neglect, abandonment, loneliness, motherhood & lifelong suffering through the harrowing discussions between a mother & her daughter that lays bare the hate & resentment they have for one another. The film also happens to be more direct & straightforward in its approach, making it one of Bergman's most accessible entries.",

            "content": "Autumn Sonata fits so well into Bergman's filmography in a couple of different ways, and it's amazing in the way that much of Bergman's late career was amazing. There's nothing showy about the film (though it is certainly visually sophisticated and adept). There's nothing grand about it (the film's scope is focused almost solely on the face of two women). And yet, through the power of Bergman's pen, his two actresses, and his cinematographer Sven Nyqisk, Bergman creates an intimate and expansive view of humanity. It's almost old hat for him.Liv Ullmann plays Eva, daughter to Charlotte, played by Ingrid Bergman. Eva is a bookish woman married to a nice man, Viktor, who begins the movie writing to her mother after she hears of Charlotte's lover's death. She earnestly wishes for Charlotte to come and visit. When the mother arrives, Eva lets it known that Helena, Eva's sister who is suffering from an unnamed degenerative disease, has been staying with her for two years. Charlotte is obviously disturbed by the fact, but she puts on the mask of a well-practiced performer and cheerfully greets her invalid daughter. Later that night, mother and (able) daughter confront each other in the dead of night. They both realize that the visit was a mistake as they let their decades of hurt loose upon each other until Charlotte leaves the next day.Like all of Bergman's best movies, this works wonderfully well on two layers. The top is the basic emotional fight between Eva and Charlotte. Charlotte was an absent mother who took up a lover while Eva's father was still alive. Eva felt completely abandoned, and it's made worse with Helena. In fact, when we first see Helena, the relationships haven't been that explicitly defined and the audience could be forgiven for thinking that Helena is Eva's child not Charlotte's. The fact that Charlotte placed Helena in a care home several years earlier, and, in fact, hadn't seen anyone in the family for a full seven years gets meted out slowly. Eva becomes vicious towards her mother as the night goes on, going so far as to blame Charlotte for Helena's illness (an unfair charge, but one more in a long line that leaves Charlotte unable to respond).The second layer is even more fascinating. From the beginning, I imagined Charlotte as a stand in for Bergman himself. By his own admission, Bergman was, at best, an absent father to his nine children (eight across five marriages and one with Liv Ullmann). He was the celebrated filmmaker while Charlotte is the celebrated concert pianist. Charlotte insists that her art is the only emotional outlet she needs to explore since it touches so many people and says so much, but that is of little consequence to Eva, the abandoned daughter. At the heart of the movie's subtext is the question: Where is the line between public love and private love? Can there be crossover between the two?The film is populated with several marvelous scenes that attack both text and subtext at the same time. The most central is probably the one where Eva plays a Chopin Sonata for Charlotte. Eva has never had Charlotte's talent, it's obvious, but she is Charlotte's daughter. So, when Eva finishes her rendition of the piece, Charlotte should speak with warmth and affection towards her daughter's efforts, shouldn't she? She can't, though. Instead of, perhaps, insincere appreciation, Charlotte offers a textbook critique of form and intent, breaking down Eva's failures as though she were just a student. Maybe Eva could use this critique in the event she were training for performance, but she wasn't. She was only trying to share in her mother's art, but her mother couldn't have it.A special note about Ingrid Bergman. Despite the shared last name, Ingmar and Ingrid were not related (ironically, Bergman's longest marriage was with another Ingrid). In fact, despite both being Swedish and having worked in movies for decades, they had never worked together before. And yet, Ingrid's performance in Autumn Sonata is, in my opinion, one of the great performances in a Bergman film. She feels like she's been in his troupe for decades. Instead, they had rehearsed (apparently acrimoniously) for a few weeks before filming, and that was it. Her Charlotte is angry, self-righteous, pained, and lost all at once in a way that shows that she had learned very much in her decades acting.",

This - even tho good - was maybe the least favorite so far.I had zero knowledge of this movie before seeing it, a perfect way to see a movie, I only knew it was a Bergman movie which of course sets a certain expectation.The acting is quite good. I was quite impressed by Ingrid Bergmans performance (it actually took me a while to figure out it was her). Ullman's performance in my opinion is a bit over the top and she doesn't quite fit the role. She felt like a warm and kind loving wife rather than a woman not capable of loving due to unhappy childhood. I didn't find her believable in the role she was put in. She looked way too content with herself for a woman holding so much anger, sadness and suppressed feelings. Her performance has been praised, but even the key scene when she looks at her mother play the piano felt somehow awkward to me. Maybe I need to watch the movie again.Since I knew nothing about the movie beforehand, I felt at times that the movie took quite drastic turns. I don't know if it was structured as well as it could've been. Things came out unexpectedly - which may have been intentional also.I also wasn't too sure that the sick sister was a necessary character here. The scenes with her are quite sparse and she's left undeveloped as a character and her part in the whole was left a bit of a mystery. I also wasn't sure why it was implied that her sickness was caused by her mothers actions, that felt quite far fetched since her condition was clearly not (only) psychological, but rather neurological.The whole movie was a bit like watching a train wreck, it's not exactly fun watching tormented characters. Which leaves me to think what the purpose of this movie was. It's nevertheless a strong drama, but it left me mostly just feeling sad. I don't know if it would be wise to see this movie again and look for symbolic stuff that I've found in Bergmans other movies, they've felt deeper and more meaningful than this. I was left wondering if the fact that Ullmann's characters son died by drowning carried a more deeper meaning, because it was revealed at a certain point in the movie. Maybe I was just overwhelmed by the drama and couldn't see deeper, but I didn't find a true meaning in this movie, other than purification of some sort.",

            "content": "Autumn Sonata (1978) :\nBrief Review -A Swedish Classic on the universal concept of strained relationship between Mother-Daughter by Master director Ingmar Bergman. Every Bergman film was literally disturbing and quite tensed kind of experience based on human life but once you get used to it the more you want to watch. I started with his old classics which felt pretty overrated because of cold theme and less appealed themes but as i watched more films i started to like the later ones. Autumn Sonata is one of those films made in his ending days and the way he crafted his heavy thoughts in modern style is i think the reason why i liked this modern film more than his old ones. Autumn Sonata is about a strained relationship between a Mother and a Daughter which first looks fine and covered but then reveals many mind shattering facts through their conversations. This idea of telling the past during conversations is so freaking amazing because this is what we do in real life, no? It doesn't take any dramatical turn to get to the core of the content hence it Hits right where it should hit. Bergman was a genius while exploring the innermost hidden facts from a human's life and this film no difference. The daughter here explains some exploding and painful moments from her childhood which were overlooked by the mother and the way it has been revealed on screen is exactly how it happens in reality. This is where Bergman has done it, and he has done in his style. His formula of putting thought provoking lines, compassionate comparisons and submerged feelings works here too. Ingrid Bergman is fantastic in her role and Liv Ullmann is even better. The sudden change in their expressions during conversation needs to be noticed to understand what great performances they actually gave. Ingmar Bergman does it again and this time not with intricateness but with most simple way possible (emotional) for the universally appealing concept. A Must See.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "content": "Cross Ingmar Bergman, (undoubtedly known to most as Sweden's greatest film director), with a performance as great as any from Ingrid Bergman's career,(most critics call her the greatest Actress to come from Sweden); and what does one get, MAGIC on screen. A fantastic movie full of underlying subtleties by Ingmar which is one of his trademarks, to push audiences to look beyond deeper into his script, full of symbolism which reveals a deeper story than what appears on the surface. Ingrid provides one of the best performances of her acting career, one of her last performances on film. Her skills reveal a classic touch proof undoubtedly, she was one of the greatest actresses to ever perform to an international audience. A Hall of Fame directorial and acting performance, with a storyline containing all the emotions known to humans, the movie makes one laugh, cry, angry, sad, happy, etc. and is rich and deep with exposing morales and ethical values of life both on the surface in the script, with underlying almost hidden nature of Ingmars work. The viewer has to think, not just listen to the script, often revealing a world of underlying subtle suggestions to morality, ethics, family values. For a movie with English sub-titles, the audience soon forgets they are reading the sub-titles as the movie draws on in so deep, one feels as if they know and comprehend the native foreign language of the film, not realizing they are reading the dialogue. (Note: this movie is now available in English and titled Autumn Sonata). One of the latter movies made by both Bergman's; befitting performances by both writer director and leading actress, a shining star of a movie appearing as a beacon to end very succesful careers upon. Both Bergman's give the performances of their careers. Nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Lead role, and Best Writer, Screenplay. Won several film awards internationally for Best European Film, Director and Actress, including the Golden Globe the National Film Critics Award, National Board of Review (USA), New York Film Critics award, Italian National Syndicate award and Bodil awards. As a side mention Liv Ullman put forth a great performance, also worthy of mention for talent above and beyond the norm. This movie contains that little bit of something extra, which make great films into all time Classics.",

Both harbor a mutual hope for reconciliation from their estranged past but the emotional baggage carried by each may be too much to overcome.The film is beautifully photographed and the script is engrossing but it is extremely \"wordy\" even for a Bergman film. There is lots of voice over narration, lots of flashbacks, lots of static dialogue, and lots of static monologue (sometimes with the character talking directly to the camera.) The on focus mother-daughter relationship is sad in itself but the overall gloom is layered on pretty thick - loss of parent, loss of husband, loss of child, bad parenting, absentee parenting, repressed anger, forced abortion, disabled child, spastic cerebral palsy, disgust, hatred, emotional detachment and so on......This is the perfect movie to watch if you're a psychoanalyst but for the casual viewer it's pretty depressing stuff. A lot of reviews give this film very high marks but this is not grade \"A\" Bergman. It is superbly crafted and well acted but it comes across more like a filmed stage play than a movie.",

            "content": "Ingmar Bergman's almost fated 1978 filmic teaming with Ingrid Bergman, Autumn Sonata (H\u00f6stsonaten), is amongst the very best of the films in his canon. It is also the most emotionally intense of the series of Strindbergian or Chekhovian chamber dramas he has filmed over the years, which includes his Spider Trilogy (Through A Glass Darkly, Winter Light, The Silence) and such other films as Cries And Whispers. That said, it is perhaps the simplest film that Bergman ever directed, even simpler in plot than The Silence. It was filmed in Norway whilst Bergman was in his self-imposed exile from Sweden over trumped up tax evasion charges, and backed with British and American money. Ingrid Bergman, meanwhile, had just been diagnosed with the cancer that would kill her a few years later, and this was he last acting role for film, although she did a final television movie portraying Golda Meier. The whole film basically revolves around the tensions between a famous pianist, Charlotte (Ingrid Bergman), and her visit to her emotionally fragile and bitter eldest daughter Eva (Liv Ullman), a four-eyed frump, who lives with her pastor husband in a vicarage. Bergman always seems his best when two female leads are front and center. He may be the best director of actresses in cinema history, and certainly the best writer for them\u0085.The camera-work by Sven Nykvist is not as blatantly showy in this film, although quite painterly in the gorgeous colorful interior of the vicarage is stunning in its reflection of the autumnal feel of the film and the state the characters are in, especially the gallery of close-ups that sear these characters and their emotions into a viewer's mind\u0085.Charlotte reminds me much of the Maureen Stapleton character, Pearl, from Woody Allen's Interiors, right down to her garish red dress, which clearly shows that she is vibrant and faces life, and to the motto she claims came from her lover, Leonardo: 'A sense of reality is a matter of talent. Most people lack that talent and maybe it's just as well.'\u0085.Ingmar Bergman is certainly a great director, but that greatness stems from his being a great writer, first and foremost. His writing is for adults, and not the deliterate preteens that current publishers (think Dave Eggers, James Frey, Elizabeth Wurtzel) and Hollywood studios aim their wares at. Be thankful for that, and for this film. Autumn Sonata is a masterpiece. Period.",

            "content": "Watching this for the first time in 2015 (37 years after its release), Autumn Sonata does not really pass the test of time. Despite fine acting by all the four principal actors and an appropriately emotive 'autumny' look and feel to the cinematography, the scripting is very dated in a bad way - labored and patronizing to the viewer.It's supposedly believable and relatively straight-forward absent-parent-isolated-child-now-both-adults premise has been very heavy-handedly weighted down by an unnecessarily overwrought script filled with dialogue that borders on the paranoid - an unintended outcome from an over earnestness on the writer-director's part, who doesn't seem to believe subtlety is a virtue in the effective conveyance of a family drama.As it is, the movie has unfortunately caricatured and locked itself into a time-style warp that doesn't lend it the relevance and timelessness of better constructed movies. As it is, the proceedings is much like an overly exaggerated stage-play where the audience is plied with layers of thick emotions of 'hidden' pain and guilt and near-hysteria, just so their minds wouldn't think and the eyes wouldn't stray from the sheer heftiness of things. Audience introspection is minimized and deemed unnecessary. And many of the revelations are closer to the rantings of spoilt children and adults, throwing the proceedings between Eva and her mother into the ilks of rich-spoilt-brats who have the luxury of indulging each other in their own self-loathing.The result is, while you admire the actors performance, the viewer is kept distant from the 'staged' characters these actors are directed to play. It is akin to watching an indulgent family quarreling amongst themselves but feeling neither sympathy nor empathy, but merely curious at the childishly 'dramatic' behavior of these players.The sometimes disjointed flow subtracts rather than add. The most obvious 'subtraction' is near the end where the matriarch (played by a wonderful Ingrid Bergman in her swan song) 'leaves suddenly'. We are told this, but we do not witness this very important departure. Given the overwrought interactions between mother and daughter(s) and the situation that was set up just prior to this 'leaving', there would have been very telling interactions amongst them during the 'leaving'. The matriarch certainly did not disappear quietly into the morning light.In the relatively short 95 mins or so, I felt I have just watched a stage play, where the focus is on highlighting the skills of the stage (and 'staged') actors, rather than on the collective strength of a well-scripted and well-directed play. It rarely felt like a movie. I would hesitate to call it 'pretentious' mainly because of the fine acting. In the hands of less able actors, such a staged script would fall square into pretentiousness.I am not familiar with Ingmar Bergman's movies - perhaps this is his 'style'. Would recommend Autumn Sonata as a 'study' of dated scripting and movie/play making, but not as an engaging movie. Maybe it once was engaging, but not today, nor likely in the future.",

They are so long and in-depth, that you get to know this mother and daughter better than most characters in any other movie. They both have flaws, they both are beautiful, and they both want to be free. But they look to the wrong places all throughout the movie. Autumn Sonata sometimes gets lost in the shuffle of the many other Bergman masterpieces, such as \"Wild Strawberries\" and \"The Seventh Seal\". However, this, along with \"Scenes from a Marriage\", are his most deep and heartfelt films. A Masterpiece in every sense of the word. One that must be experienced with your whole heart and will have you grabbing your seat as the letter is read at the end of the movie. Liv Ullman is rivaled in this film only by her other performances. And Ingrid Bergman is devastating in her only Ingmar Bergman role.****/****",

On arrival, Bergman launches into an extensive monologue that foretells a very emotional and erratic woman. The two have not seen one another for some time. Before long we realize there are feelings of long-held hurts and misunderstandings.Bergman's role as a great pianist with extensive wealth contrasts with her daughter who lives modestly with her husband, a country parson, and her much-loved invalid sister. She has also lost a child whose room remains a place of repose for her.Despite a difficult life, she has no bitterness...except towards her mother. Ullman's frustration does pour out later in the film. Her strong performance brings out her pent up frustration with her mother's neglect during her childhood. All the unleashed emotion has an impact on her mother. The climax makes you feel as if you are right there in the film with all the discomfort it brings.A excellent movie with an inconclusive ending, it was by any standards well worth watching.

Ingrid Bergman also does a commendable job.The characters are very carefully etched. Even before the confrontation begins I could sense the change is Liv Ullmann when she is in presence of her mother. I could see in her a 12 year old kid desperate for her mother's approval without being told so explicitly. And mostly I remember her distraught face when she watches her mother play. Having already watched her in 5 other Bergman movies, I thought I knew her expressions. But that face will probably trouble me in the night when I try to sleep for a few days.Whenever I watched Ingrid rebuke Liv, I could see in my mind as if she was kicking her daughter in her gut. Watching this movie made me so thankful that I didn't had a parent like that and appreciate them much more.Another masterpiece by Bergman with some of the best performances I have ever seen.",

I've had the Criterion DVD of this one for years, but only now did I get to check it out; while I greatly admire Bergman's skill as a writer and director, his films \u2013 particularly from PERSONA (1966) onwards \u2013 are often too downbeat and hysterical to be exactly an enticing proposition and, even after one has gone through them, aren't likely to be remembered with affection! It seems to me that, following CRIES AND WHISPERS (1972), Bergman found a sort of niche with the exploration of family sagas \u2013 invariably exposing the passions and torments boiling underneath, and which are outwardly displayed through austere and intense visuals (often given to reddish hues). Even at a manageable 93 minutes, therefore, this was hard to sit through \u2013 along with my later less-than-pleasant experience with his last effort, SARABAND (2003), I thought it better not to risk being similarly 'disappointed' by his 5-hour marathon chamber piece SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE (1973) and opted to leave it for another time! Anyway, to get back to the film at hand, there's no denying the powerhouse performances of its two stars \u2013 Ingrid Bergman is superb in her theatrical swan-song; a somewhat frumpy-looking Liv Ullman is content, at first, to take a back seat to the Hollywood veteran but, gradually, she asserts herself (culminating in a tirade on the former's selfishness, neglect of her duties and incapacity to love which is the film's centerpiece). Bergman was deservedly Oscar-nominated for her role but the equally great Ullman was snubbed; Ingmar Bergman's rather variable script, then, also received a nod by the Academy.Bergman veterans Erland Josephson and Gunnar Bjornstrand appear in silent roles (the former in flashbacks as Bergman's husband and Ullman's father and the latter as Bergman's agent, where she's required to speak to him in English!). A subplot in the narrative \u2013 which threatens to send proceedings into near-parody \u2013 sees the various characters' relationship with another relative who has a speech impediment (brought on by an illness and for which Ullman blames Bergman).To be frank, nobody speaks or reacts like Bergman characters in real-life: in this case, what one is watching ultimately is not a slice-of-life but sheer melodrama centering around two fine actresses \u2013 by an intuitive film-maker with a resolve to take such 'gloom and doom' antics as far as they will go...",

The cinematography is minimalist when it comes to motions of the camera, exquisite when it comes to color, and the unforgettable close-up figural compositions .I understand that some might criticize that this film is melodramatic, what makes it compelling is it doesn't use cheap tricks to provoke emotion in the viewer, it uses brilliant dialog and outstanding pacing to draw the viewer in. Once started, it is the character interactions that draw you in more than anything.Bergmann makes us feel for these characters despite their flaws and portrays the utter tragedy of people unable to change or reconcile themselves, much like in real life relationships.He knows how to push our buttons as humans but doesn't do it to give us nightmares but to expand our understanding of the human dilemma. This is one of a handful of films that I've watched out of hundreds of classics that has truly moved me emotionally. Another poster said that this movie isn't gender specific; I agree entirely and argue that this film deals with universal truths between offspring and parent, not just mother and daughter issues or the problem of divorce or abandonment. Sure there are directors that can shock you or give you nightmares or make you cry: Gaspar Noe, Lukas Moodysson \"Lilia 4 Ever\" as two examples. This is different, but I can't place my finger on exactly what... I can get the sense that Lars von Trier's pursuit of somewhat melodramatic plots in movies like Breaking the Waves might have some roots in Bergman's work",

Charlotte is at loose ends after her lover dies, and returns to Sweden to visit her daughter. Both mother and daughter share personal tragedies. Charlotte's daughter (and Eva's sister) Helena, who lives with Eva, is immobilized by a neurological disease. She hasn't told Charlotte that Helena is in the house, because she fears that her mother, repelled by Helena's disability, will refuse to visit. Eva's tragedy is the drowning of her four-year-old son, Erik. Her husband grieves, but in Eva's mind, he's still alive. Charlotte, who took excellent care of her lover in his final illness, has always neglected her daughters. She's frankly bored by Eva. In a brilliant scene, alone in the guest bedroom, she withdraws back into her private life, musing about money and playing Ravel. Poor Eva is still trying to wring some love and recognition out of her mother. The evening culminates in a middle-of -the-night brawl between Eva and Charlotte. Eva accuses her mother of being cold, withholding and of abandoning her, Helena and their father. It seems to me that Eva is blaming her mother for too much and letting her father off the hook. When I first saw this film when I was younger, I identified with the Eva character, but now seeing it as an adult and a parent, I have more balanced sympathies. Charlotte is self-absorbed and puts her music first, but if she were a man it would be acceptable. She'll never give Eva the love she wants. Eva withdraws into her fantasy relationship with her dead son--in death, he gives her the unconditional acceptance she's always longed for. This is a brilliant film, both Ullman and Bergman are brilliant and pull out the stops. It's also great to watch it on DVD; it's so emotionally wrenching that it's good to be able to take a break and come back to it.",

There is therefore a certain amount of moralism in these movies.\"Autumn sonata\" tells the story of a mother (Charlotte played by Ingrid Bergman) and her daughter (Eva played by Liv Ullmann). The mother is a respected classical pianist, the daughter is married with a country clergyman. They haven't seen each other for very long and the daughter has invited her mother in her house after the lover of the mother has passed away.In \"Autumn sonata\" Bergman tries to make a psychological movie and to avoid moralism. In the beginning he puts the viewer of the scent by making Charlotte very mundane and self centered and giving Eva frumpy clothes and ditto haircut. Our sympathies immediately are with Eva. These sympathies balance out during a nightly debate in which Eva blames her mother for about everything that has gone wrong in her life.A film like this depends for a great deal on the performances of the main actresses, and these are both splendid. Bergman casted them with care. Both did have a period in their private life when the relation to their children was difficult.Bergman and his cinematographer Nykvist as usual excel in this kind of \"kammerspiel\", filming in close up to get the most out of the facial expressions. Only a few scenes (including the flashbacks) are not in close up, and they provide the necessary break from claustrophobia.When I got interested in Bergman, I found his films from the '70s rather vague and gloomy. His highest rated films were \"The seventh seal\" (1957) and \"Wild strawberries\" (1957). Now (11-08-2020) these films are displaced at the top of the IMDB list by \"Scenes from a marriage\" (1974) and \"Autumn sonata\" (1978).",

            "content": "One of Ingmar Bergman's very best after Scenes from a Marriage (1974) with a woman-woman (mother-daughter) relationship instead of man-woman one. Moreover the crucial central relationship played brilliantly by Liv Ullmann and Ingrid Bergman is immensely augmented by the husband's perspective and interaction, and slightly by the sister's plight. A thought-provocative, tough script full of monologues is brought to life spectacularly with top notch acting and directing. The two Bergmans are at the top of their art and the scene when the mother shares her different point of view on how to play Chopin's prelude is one of the best have seen in a long time. Truly riveting,smart,subtle and poignant. Many superior scenes hold the movie together and the narrative is finding and challenging. It makes us think, question, consider, understand and empathise different versions of their reality and by extension our own. Bravo Bergmans!",

            "content": "It's oddly appropriate to be writing this only a few days after Mothers' Day, celebrating the woman who gave us life and love, along with the permanent insecurities and flaws to go with it. AUTUMN SONATA is one of the most piercingly emotional films ever made, with raw and unflinching honesty. The story of a worldly pianist (Ingrid Bergman in her final film role) who returns home to her two daughters upon the death of her partner, the owlish writer Eva and the handicapped Lena. Though overjoyed by the reunion at first, it's apparent that Eva still carries the scars of Charlotte's choosing her career over her family, and the night will re- open many wounds and create new injuries with each painful revelation. Before long the great divide between love and hate, repulsion and longing, will become deeply blurred. AUTUMN SONATA is to mothers and daughters as WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? is to husbands and wives.This is what only two years later ORDINARY PEOPLE should've been and to its own credit Robert Redford got close, but Ingmar Bergman was a master at crafting characters with complexities and contradictions. Even though most of the film's time frame is the period of one night with flashbacks, these two characters go on such a journey of self-discovery. The film is framed like a sonata; the slow beginning, the climax 2/3 of the way through, and then a finale of re-examination. When the film begins, Eva is shaped as a mousy and reserved wife and Charlotte is a mildly self-absorbed pianist. As the film progresses on, the daughter experiences a surge of enough confidence brought on by wine to tell off her mother, and the battle for love, truth and power begins. Finally, as both mother and daughter are stripped down of their armor, we only see two humans desperately wanting love but impotent to do act upon it.Ingmar Bergman's handle over his actors wasn't out of the norm, but it's still exhilarating to experience the performances he gets out of them. As the moral center of the film, Halvar Bj\u00f6rk delivers quietly sensitive work as Eva's faithful husband. Lena Nyman is powerful as the handicapped daughter. Liv Ullmann delivers one of her greatest performances as the conflicted daughter Eva, her face registering so many emotions with the faintest of movements. Above all, Ingrid Bergman is amazing in perhaps the most layered character and performance of her career. Everyone loves Ingrid Bergman for her work in CASABLANCA and NOTORIOUS among the many classics she acted in. After decades of work, there's a newfound maturity and haunted worldliness that's so poignant and truthful it hurts. Ingrid Bergman was dying of breast cancer when she made this film, and her bravery for taking on at many times an unlikable character is what cements her as one of the all-time greatest actresses. Every pain, every triumph is piercingly registered on that gorgeously natural face of hers, which always remained so open and uncompromising that it was more than an actor's mask; it was a map of the human heart.There's a scene towards the end where Charlotte attempts to atone for her daughter's pain, which is intercut with Lena crying for help. Three people, all so open and vulnerable, waiting for retribution or reparation. This is the end of the climax, and as the film begins its finale, Ingmar Bergman never once judges his characters, no matter how confused or insane they are. He recognizes that humans are flawed creatures always searching for love at whatever cost, and simultaneously rejecting it out of fear. AUTUMN SONATA is Bergman's most emotionally satisfying film, and his last great masterwork. It's a sonata hanging in air, with a perfect and delicate balance of loss and hope.",

            "review_title": "A ferocious, highly personal drama",
            "content": "To date I've seen only a few of Ingmar Bergman's films, and I readily admit my feelings are mixed, ranging from love to simple admiration to indifference. Though this doesn't leap out of the gate with a major impression, its strength builds over time, until it suddenly roars to vicious life - and I love it. The value of art, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder, and in my experience so far Bergman is at his best when his approach to the cinematic art form is deeply, trenchantly personal. What is more personal than the roiling, complicated feelings among family? From the relatively low-key first two-thirds, in which Eva and Charlotte poorly pretend at everything being okay, to the ferocious last act in which every deep-seated enmity and self-hatred comes gushing out, to the somewhat ambiguous ending that may portend a flicker of hope or a continuation of the status quo, 'Autumn sonata' surges like a storm that leaves uncertainty in its wake.The picture boasts terrible depths that relatively few others have been able to achieve, or at least certainly without the same level of vibrant success. With searingly realist flair the screenplay broaches the true difficulty of communication where any feelings are involved: expectations learned directly or indirectly from other family members; self-loathing instilled with the most casual of remarks or gestures; neglect, the absence of love, the inability to love; resentment bred from what goes unspoken, and from the concatenation of circumstances; incapability of communicating openly without completely tearing down the facade that has been kluged together over time; intoxicants as the only key to unlocking any earnestness. And so on, and so on. Anyone who has not had at least some small degree of these experiences with their own family members is either lying to themselves or extraordinarily fortunate; anyone who doesn't recognize the ugly, frank genuineness in Bergman's screenplay should be either pitied or congratulated - I'm not sure which.Between Bergman's skill as both writer and director, and stalwart cinematographer Sven Nykvist's keen eye, every shot and scene feels both perfectly natural and absolutely meticulous in its construction. The story is simple on the surface, but only because its core is one strictly of acerbic dialogue and profound emotion; its characters are as real and human as any flesh and blood. In the peerless hands of Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullmann, those characters burst to life with all the incredible range, nuance, and personality they or anyone could possibly muster. Long before the tumultuous peak rolls around, there's a moment where Charlotte, played by Bergman, is quietly observing Eva (Ullmann), and such a flurry of disparate thoughts and feelings crosses her face within a matter of a few seconds, realized with total control and coolness, that it strikes me as some of the most remarkable acting I've ever seen. As the conversations between mother and daughter escalate their performances only reach an ever-greater crescendo, not least with Ullmann flawlessly capturing Eva's exquisitely awful swirl of hurt and hate - to the point that though this zenith is hardly more than dialogue, it becomes as wholly riveting as any feature could hope to be.None of this is to count out more the more subtle but equally solid supporting performances of Lena Nyman, Halvar Bj\u00f6rk, or others, nor the swell contributions of other folks involved. Yet the real power of 'Autumn sonata' unquestionably lies within its two principle stars, and Bergman's painfully honest writing, and this is all the movie needs to be a tremendous success. I had mixed expectations before watching based simply on my reactions to Ingmar to date, but there's no doubt in my mind that this is surely among his best films; in the very least, it's among his most personal and impactful. A content warning of a sort may be appropriate for those who have had troubled relationships with their own family, yet at that, there's a certain measure of catharsis in seeing such ills played out before us. Even just as a matter of cinematic preferences this won't appeal to all viewers, but for those who appreciate a good drama, whatever turns it might take, this is pretty much a must-see, well worth seeking out.",

            "content": "Ingmar Bergman's \"Autumn Sonata\" is one of the most underrated gems from any director that I've ever seen and is one of the most well acted movies that I've seen in recent years which makes me even more eager to dive into his work as a director after seeing this movie and his other masterpiece \"The Seventh Seal\". Ingrid Bergman stars in her final feature film role as well as the role that would get her a final Oscar nomination as Charlotte a successful concert pianist who goes to visit her daughter Eva (Liv Ullmann) and her husband Viktor (Halvar Bj\u00f6rk) for a few days to spend time with them and her sister mentally disabled sister Helena (Lena Nyman). Then things start to unravel between Charlotte and Eva about Eva's feelings toward her mother for having neglected her for all those years and basically blames her for putting her and her father though hell because her mother chose to pursue a career instead of raising her daughter and being there for her husband, and it is the scenes that focus on this that make it one of the most well acted sequences in any movie period. This is the only movie that Ingmar Bergman and Ingrid Bergman ever worked on together which is kind of unfortunate because Ingrid Bergman would only live for another four years and die from breast cancer and Ingmar Bergman would continue directing feature films until \"Fanny and Alexander\" which many consider to be his swan song and then move into television films for the following twenty years afterward and retire completely from filmmaking and directing plays and died in 2007 at 89 years old. As for Ingrid Bergman's performance I think the Oscar nomination was well deserved and also that Liv Ullmann deserved a nomination for best supporting actress. Ingmar Bergman's direction along with Sven Nykvist's cinematography sets the stage without one error during the movies hour and a half runtime. This is on e of the finest foreign films I have ever seen and is one of 1978's very best films.",

            "content": "Ingmar Bergman shot \"Autumn Sonata\" in ravishing color, (Sven Nykvist again was his DoP), and set it in the present but it may as well have been in black and white and set a hundred or so years ago since this is one of his most rigorous films, seen almost entirely in close-up. It's about the relationships between a mother and her daughter, (two daughters if you count the girl in near vegetative state upstairs), and the great and painful chasm that exists between them. The mother is a great concert pianist, poised, self-assured and frostier than any ice maiden and she is played by Ingrid Bergman, working with the director for the first time and giving a magnificent performance. The daughter is the mousy, timorous wife of a vicar until one extraordinary night she roars and pours out all the bile she has inside her and she is played superbly by Liv Ullmann.To say that the characters in Bergman's films don't speak or act the way 'real' people do is like saying Shakespeare's characters don't behave like people do in 'real' situations. It doesn't matter a damn; as with Shakespeare, Bergman's characters bear their souls to us and this greatest of actor's directors draws performances from his players that go beyond mere acting allowing us to get under their skins and inside their heads.There are a number of characters in this piece but most of them are glimpsed only in the background. Fundamentally this is a sonata for two people and both Bergman and Ullmann have seldom been better. It was Bergman who won all the awards and got the Oscar nomination but Ullmann, too, was equally deserving of recognition. If it isn't quite the masterpiece it might have been, (there are times it does feel a bit schematic and even predictable), it is nevertheless a major work of art and an essential work in both Bergman canons.",

            "content": "Ingmar Bergman's 'H\u00f6stsonaten' is an intense claustrophobic drama about a dysfunctional relationship between a somewhat estranged mother and her daughter. Most of the movie is depicted through a series of interaction between the two. It is set in Charlotte's house which has a homely feel but through the interaction one can sense a claustrophobia. Bergman uses a lot of closeups that, along with the actors' subtle nuances, hint what is to come.The way he sensibly handles the parent child interaction, which at the beginning, appears to be like any mother-daughter relationship, gradually unfold (hinting that not all is as it seems) and then suddenly explode is excellent. This could have easily become a soap-opera-type melodrama had it been in the hands of a lesser director but Ingmar Bergman and his actors, the legendary Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman with their raw cathartic performances, astonish the viewers. Ingrid Bergman delivers her final performance that beautifully seals her career. Ullman balances her nuances with tremendous skill and effectively matches wits with Bergman. The subtle soundtrack also deserves mention. Music isn't just part of the background but it also gives voice to the unsaid words. I particularly loved the Chopin pieces.'H\u00f6stsonaten' is not an easy watch because it does not kid the viewer by hiding or merely suggesting anything. It is and brutal and unsympathetic in its exposure of raw human emotions. It is an intense film experience that is nothing short of a worthy view.",

In a long scene in the middle of the night, Eva and Charlotte lay all their cards on the table and defy one another to answer the question: Who is the strong one here?I have to admit the ending surprised me: Bergman often wrote disastrous endings or at least doubtful ones, but here he allows the audience to hope.

            "content": "It might seem weird but as I re-watch this film, Ingrid Bergman's character appears to me far more human than it previously did. For this reason I disagree with most reviewers' interpretation of Charlotte. It is true that she has been neglecting her family both physically and emotionally, she must be partly (but not entirely!) to blame for Eva's inner disharmony, she is self-centered in a way many artists are; but at the same time she is (and always was) aware of her faults (many of which are rooted in her own childhood), and her behaviour is a constant painful attempt to escape this awareness. When Charlotte talks to herself after having greeted Helena, we see she is terrified (as it's her own flesh and blood she faces so hideously crippled), the ill daughter is a reminder of the mother's helplessness, so Charlotte's attitude towards Helena, though shocking, is anything but indifferent.For similar reasons the famous Chopin scene seems to me much subtler than a plain 'mother's demonstration of superiority'. While listening to Eva playing the music, Charlotte starts crying, and those are genuine tears that even came against her wish. Then, it is Eva who asks Charlotte to show her a different interpretation. Charlotte is reflecting on how this music should be played, but Eva feels that it's a tactless reminder of her mediocrity. I can imagine that it's a way Charlotte used to make her daughter feel, but in this particular scene she doesn't seem to have such an intention.Ingrid Bergman wrote in her autobiography that she wanted Ingmar Bergman to change her heroine a little. It was too hard for her to understand how a woman can be such a cruel mother. Charlotte has been away from her daughter for 7 years, which means that she never came to see her own grandson, nor did she come to support Eva after the boy drowned. But at the end the actress achieved the impossible, as one feels sympathy for this heroine (as I did really), despite all of her moral crimes. In the scene of the night conversation it was difficult to me to be on Eva's side, which is a paradox in a sense. After all, we know that Charlotte brought unhappiness to her family, while Eva dedicates her days to helping other people. But I do suspect that one of the reasons why Eva invited Charlote to stay was her (i.e. Eva's) wish to resolve the old painful matters. Some of the accusations are unbelievably cruel and seem irrelevant even before Eva herself admits it.For me one of the central themes in the film is a price an artist must pay not only for his fame, but also for a true noble joy of dedicating his life to Art. We see that Charlotte loveless childhood is a reason for her motherly faults, but the same early loneliness probably made Charlotte an artist, because music was the only way she could express herself. Eva reproaches Charlotte for using the talent as a justification to all her minor and major sins, but this moment is present in many artists' lives. One sees how helpless he is in the commonest human relationships, it's hard to face the truth that people suffer because of you, so the only consolation is a hope that your talent making your listeners happy would compensate for the faults. For Charlotte this didn't work, because the damage she caused is too severe, and she probably doubts whether her artistic life had any meaning.Still, the ending of the film leaves me with some hope that a new conversation between the two women will take place, because after their confrontation they would never be the same.",

Whenever Bergman, the actress, is left alone, she is also left with soliloquies that are impossible to play. She tries hard. It feels awkward to watch her fail. It feels like seeing your child who you believed to be talented up to this point failing in a high school drama production.\nThe same goes for Ullmann. Her rants and outbursts are abundant, but come out of nowhere. Somehow it looks like there was a lot of onion abuse on the set to make the eyes of the actresses appear so inflamed in the close ups.Bergman was a somehow haunted soul with a talent to bring to the stage what others bring to the office of their therapist. Maybe the only joke in the film is that Bergman plays Bergman. The always busy director and bigger than live father who never had time for his nine children is portrayed by an internationally successful pianist who was neglected by her own parents. She is tormented by back pain as Bergman, the director was by stomach ache. Ullmann takes the part of Bergman's neglected child while an incredibly sick child upstairs takes the part of all the others, crying out for a parent that is always absent. The setting is a melodramatic soap opera.\nThis movie has not aged well in time.

It was Helena that Charlotte had committed when she was in her teens to a mental institution for life because of her mental disability. Things soon get a bit sticky when Eve who feels that her life had been destroyed by her mother's absence, playing in concerts all over Europe, now lets Charlotte have it in how unloving she was towards her and the mentally ill kid sister of hers Helena.With Viktor drinking his brandy and smoking his pipe and Helena falling out of her bed and almost cracking her skull open mother & daughter, Charlotte & Eve, have it out in a night long discussion in how their lives were messed up by each other not showing the both love and respect for themselves all those years together. It's Eve who ends up getting the upper hand in the conversation in getting Charlotte to admit that she was more interested in her career as a concert pianist then in her two daughters as well as live in lover Leonardo, Georg Lokkeberg, who after putting up with her for almost 20 finally and blissfully, in not having to put up with her anymore, passed away from cancer six months ago.After an all night verbal slug-fest both Eve & Charlotte decided to bury the hatchet, in the sand not in each other heads, and let bygones by bygones and start all over again as if nothing happened in the past. Later after Charlotte left Eve gave her husband Viktor who was neutral in the entire matter a letter of forgiveness to her mother for everything bad she said about her. It's now up to Charlotte to do the same in asking for forgiveness from Eve as well as the mentally damaged Helena for all the bad things she did to them while they were still together. And undoubtedly in what we saw in the movie up until then, with Charlotte in tears in knowing what she did, she definitely will.",

Don't think this is a movie about crazy daughter and mother with some special unsolved history behind them. This movie is about You.

            "content": "Ingmar Bergman's \"Autumn Sonata\" (1978) is truly one the best dramatic performances that I have ever seen. This is definitely not for those enamoured of typical \"brain dead\" Hollywood films, but is surely for the viewer who can appreciate much more intelligent fare. It is a \"thinking person's\" film.Autumn Sonata can surely be compared to the proverbial onion that is peeled back layer by layer until one reaches its essential core. The joyful reunion between mother (Ingrid Bergman) and daughter (Liv Ullman) is gradually revealed to be a very superficial, very polite, and very civilized layer of a bitter, and even desperate core relationship that exists between them. In the course of traversing these existential layers of Social Reality, the writer, through elegant imagery, and philosophical overtones embedded in the dialogue takes the viewer through the essential past events that have transpired to create this most complex of mother-daughter relationships.The role that is given to Ingrid here truly plays, in my opinion, to her greatest strength as an actor, that of being able to deliver a convincing transformation of personality and emotion in the course of a film, and often in the course of a single scene. Her genius for being able to do so shines most brightly in her earliest Swedish films, before she relocated to Hollywood, where the contrived status given to her as a \"sex symbol\" most often neglected the depths of her acting ability. Now back in her native Scandinavia late in her career, Ingrid is given an opportunity to once again shine forth her brilliance by a writer/director who truly understands the breadth and the depth of what she can do in front of a camera. Liv, an already accomplished actor in her own right before this film, is nonetheless allowing Ingrid, by necessity, to take the lead in successfully passing through the emotional, visceral, and mental gymnastics needed to execute her own role in this film, which she does far more than adequately.The saddest aspect of this film for me is that rarely does an adult child ever reach such a meeting of the mind, and of emotion with a parent over supposedly inflicted childhood traumas. Most people see their parents go to the grave before they can express the honest feelings and thoughts expressed by the adult daughter to her mother in this film. In a very ironic way then, beyond the core \"ugliness\" in the relationship between the mother and daughter in Autumn Sonata lies a type of idealism, an idealism that we can one day transcend the traumas of our past, and thereby fulfill our full human potential. The daughter's conciliatory letter to her mother at the end of a film is the first step of her now renewed journey to reach that personal fulfillment.20 Stars !!! 20 Stars !!! 20 Stars !!!",

Familiar thematic territory for Ingmar Bergman, who puts his characters (and the audience) through the wringer, but this chamber piece is so richly performed by the leads and beautifully shot by Sven Nykvist that it's pointless to object; its slow-paced and austere finesse eventually gives way to raw outbursts of psychic admission, foreseeably open-ended conclusion on the potential for reconciliation.

Eva (Liv Ullmann) is the daughter who thinks she so wanted the visit, but almost immediately replays the fraught relationship she had with Charlotte growing up. Eva still mourns the death of her son, Erik, who drowned at age four. Eva is also taking care of her sister, Helena (Lena Nyman) who has a long standing neurological disease that affects her movement and her speech. Eva is the only one who can understand her. Charlotte had sent Helena to an institution years before. Viktor (Halvar Bj\u00f6rk) is a Lutheran bishop married to Eva and contributes his observations both at the beginning and several times through the film.I frankly got irritated with the script as I watched. There was nothing redeeming in the relationship between Charlotte and her daughters though everyone professed to want a loving relationship. There was little hope for any grace in this film within the limits of the text Ingmar Bergman created.Ingmar Bergman himself was a poor parent, with five wives and additional mistresses and nine children with six women. He paid little attention to his children, being focused on his art. In that sense he was a male Charlotte. The movie is beautifully filmed, and Bergman's magic with closeups and music continues. There is a powerful scene where Eva and Charlotte each play a Chopin piece completely differently and we get to watch the reaction of the listener.One thing that surprised me was that Liv Ullmann chose to play her character as a plain housewife. I didn't think she could look \"plain.\" She did it effectively.",

            "content": "It's not usually considered among Bergman's masterpieces, but Autumn Sonata is easily on par with the other four Bergman's I've had the pleasure of viewing. In theme, mood, structure, etc, it's most closely similar to Cries and Whispers, but trades the crushing misery of that film for a more melancholic \"autumnal\" sadness. Like Cries and Whispers, this is a heartrending painting of a film, utilizing reds and browns to evoke a mood of reflective sadness. It focuses more on character interrelations and human emotions then is usual for Bergman, with less symbolism and existential truths than his other, more famous works, but still rings painfully true.The structure is quite simple, a mother (Charlotte, played perfectly by Ingmar Bergman in her only Bergman role) comes to visit her daughter (Eva, played by Liv Ullman) after seven years, and they spend a few days at the house with Liv Ullman's husband and mentally handicapped sister. Most of the film takes place in the house and is almost completely dialogue driven. It seems sort of like an after-life, reflecting upon the drama of the past, which we only see through short palely coloured flashbacks, seeming distant and unchangeable. Mother and daughter slowly confront their past, at first avoiding it and stepping around conflict, but it eventually builds up to one long, cathartic scene, in which they both let fly all their hatred and resentment at each other. After that, they part and we see shots of each of them in their respective environments, finally out of the claustrophobic environment of the house. The film ends with a letter from daughter to mother, expressing a seemingly unattainable hope that they can reconcile, forget the past, and finally show affection for one another.The main subject here is the intense relationship between mother and daughter, how pain is handed back and forth between the two. Charlotte wanted love from her child, but through this want only managed to give pain and resentment. Eva, distanced from her mother, wanted only affection, but she could only watch from a distance and hand the same pain back. It's expressed best at the end of the most intense, cathartic scene in Eva's words:\"A mother and a daughter. What a terrible combination of feelings and confusion and destruction. Everything is possible and done in the name of love and solicitude. The mother's injuries are to be handed down to the daughter, the mother's failures are to be paid for by the daughter, the mother's happiness is to be the daughter's unhappiness. It's as if the umbilical cord had never been cut.\"Part of Bergman's genius is how he can be so incredibly intimate with these characters and their problems, yet still express such universal truths.After the exhausting venting of emotions, we cut to Helena, Eva's handicapped sister and Charlotte's daughter, writhing around in bed, mirroring the inner emotional turmoil of the two main characters, and then Charlotte lays down speaks of her cold, unfeeling childhood, confirming the chain of misery that we have already seen expressed between her and her daughter. The scene fades out with Charlotte softly asking Eva for help and Helena crying out for her mother, a perfect expression of both the unbearable but unchangeable pain, and the vague hope for reconciliation.However, the film is not all pain and suffering. It ends on a ambiguous, yet slightly positive note, and throughout the film we see an expression of the hope that pain can come to be accepted and an appreciation of the melancholic beauty of life. At one point, Charlotte, talking of a past memory of her ex-lover drunkenly playing piano, says \"he played badly but beautifully\", a perfect metaphor for Charlotte and Eva's drunken stumbling through their own emotions and troubled past, and the beauty of man's weaknesses in general. The whole film is drenched not in a mood of immanent misery, but in one of calm, reflective sorrow. The pain is all in the past and the characters attempt to deal with it. At one point Eva expresses, \"To me, man is a tremendous creation, an inconceivable thought. In man is everything, from the highest to the lowest. ...There are no limits, neither to thoughts, nor to feelings. It's anxiety that sets the limits.\" Here we have the summation of the film, and even Bergman's work in general. The universe is a beautiful, endlessly complex thing, but unfortunately we cannot understand it, being trapped in our human limits created by angst and anxiety. What truly makes him a genius though, is his ability to express this longing so articulately using the most intimate relations of these characters. Autumn Sonata is a heartrending testament to both the cruelty of life and the incomprehensible beauty of it, and yet another cinematic masterpiece by one of the greatest artists of the 20th century.",

Turning a blind eye to them in hope (or rather in belief) of them fading away with the passage of time as if they were merely bitter childhood memories would only further deepen and engraving them into the growing psyche, later coalescing into a distorted identity on the verge of collapse once the past unfolds, and grieving is the catalyst for that.The theatrical origins of monologues writ large no matter how cinematically delivered and presented. We, cinephiles, used to look past this. Here, monologues are completely shorn of their theatrical quality, resulting in some of the most achingly realistic, gut-wrenching movie scenes ever.

It does not take long before we sense suppressed emotions, and a very strained relationship between the two women. Ingrid Bergmann's efforts in the film led to an Oscar nomination, and quite rightly so. But seeing the oppressed and unhappy daughter (Ullmann) settle with her mother is really great acting. Ullmann manages to show what a bad childhood for her, an absent mother can lead to of trauma and difficult feelings. In this movie, everything comes to the fore. Bergmann was not afraid to address complicated and difficult interpersonal relationships, and the Autumn Sonata is an excellent example where this can take place.

In general, it lacks subtlety and the ending is a weak attempt at transformation which lacked credibility for me. Maybe in its day it was groundbreaking psychologically but I think better acting and editing was needed for greatness.\nThe subplot with the disabled sister and especially the cryptic flashback to her youth seem unneeded to me, just a thickening rather than a new flavor.\nThe scene where daughter and then mother play the same piano work by Chopin is quite original and well done.\nIt merits seeing as a work by Bergman with Bergman as lead for your fund of film experience.",

Eva leads a quiet life along a Norwegian fjord with her husband Viktor (Halvar Bj\u00f6rk), the village priest, while Charlotte is a famed pianist who travels the world for concerts. When Charlotte comes to visit, Eva is initially joyful, but within just a few hours all of Eva's bottled up emotions spill over. Some remarkable flashbacks reveal the betrayals that Charlotte inflicted on her family while pursuing her career (they feature Erland Josefsson as Eva's father, through in a silent role). As mother and daughter bicker, weep and confess their sins, one might expect a happy resolution. Bergman provides something rather different, however, and it undoubtedly will make some viewers furious. Nonetheless, I enjoy the film's observation that in real life, not all attempts at resolution between two people are straightforward.Bergman was the son of a Swedish Lutheran priest, and he found his father and his faith a very intimidating presence. Priests show up in a number of Bergman films, and he has tended to portray them either as pure evil, or good but very tormented. Here, it's refreshing to see the vicar as a humble, content fellow and a loving husband. Lena Nyman's role as Eva's disabled sister is convincingly played, and the pain Bergman communicates through this part is devastating. A major concern of the script is a sort of psychoanalysis, laying bare some innermost motivations and flaws found in every human being, and Bergman offers many insights in some powerful and memorable, even quotable, lines.There's been a tendency to treat the several films Bergman produced between the mid-1970s and FANNY OCH Alexander as minor, but I would rank H\u00d6STSONATEN among his best work.",

I found quite charming the fact that the colors in the movie are all autumnal, which fits the title perfectly.After the death of her long time friend and partner, Charlotte (Ingrid Bergman) accepts the invitation of her daughter Eva (Liv Ullmann) and her husband Viktor (Halvar Bj\u00f6rk) to come and stay with them a while. On her arrival, she's unpleasantly surprised to find her other daughter Helena (Lena Nyman) there as well, since she had sent her to a hospital because she's mentally disabled. Charlotte hasn't seen Eva in years because she's always touring, as she's a world famous pianist, and after the joy of seeing each other wears off, one night the two women start recalling Eva's childhood and, in a heated fight, manage to finally tell each other what they always wanted to say.Autumn Sonata deals with the negative consequences on a child's later life, caused by the fact that a parent is too concentrated on his/her career and therefore is ignoring his/her child. Interestingly, this was a well known issue for Ingrid Bergman, who had become famous for leaving her family and running away with Italian director Roberto Rossellini. But it was also not an unknown theme for Ingmar Bergman who, according to one of his sons, \"hadn't been a father at all\". Regardless, it's a difficult theme and the movie tries to explore all its implications: therefore it is mostly made of dialogue, which can become boring if the movie doesn't grip you. But I think it's very difficult not to get emotionally involved in the story, especially since relationships between parents and children are rarely simple.Because of so much dialogue and because it is mostly set in Eva's house, Autumn Sonata reminds of theatre, which is where Bergman started his career. Also, all the characters apart from Charlotte and Eva are not that relevant and they only help define the mother-daughter relationship better. Liv Ullmann and Ingrid Bergman deliver great performances. Every detail is carefully planned, like for example their external appearance: Eva wants to go unnoticed in her dull colored clothes, tied hair and huge glasses, while her mother is elegant, beautiful and self-confident. And even though this changes after their night-long discussion, we get the impression that the message of this movie is \u2013 things never change, especially when they become routine, no matter how much we (think we) want them to change. Nonetheless, Autumn Sonata is a beautiful and intelligent movie, and a definite recommendation.Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",

            "content": "Autumn Sonata is a gem of a film from renowned Swedish director Ingmar Bergman which centers around the complicated and difficult relationship of a famous pianist, Charlotte and her eldest daughter, Eva, portrayed by stalwarts Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullmann respectively.Autumn Sonata begins with the pianist mother Charlotte visiting Eva and her husband. Initially, the mother-daughter relationship does seem a bit frigid though courteous. Gradually, as the film unfolds, several dimensions to this relation gets revealed -Charlotte's career, Eva's childhood, the presence of a second daughter among others.Autumn Sonata's most enduring memory is its crescendo involving the two brilliant actors Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullmann. While it would amount to being a spoiler attempting to describe what happens, it can suffice to say that Ingmar Bergman's greatness bursts through in this climax and one discovers the tremendous potential of a chamber drama.This is no doubt what great cinema is about and while one of the two central figures certainly blows the viewer away with her intensity, the tremendous impact and presence of the other can only be felt on multiple viewing, and this chemistry is what contributes to Autumn Sonata being perhaps one of the best films ever made, most certainly by Ingmar Bergman and maybe even in the history of cinema.",

It seems as though the film couldn't be set anywhere else but in Scandinavia and it's almost reminiscent of certain Ibsen's works - nothing happens in Autumn Sonata, yet I could talk about the film for hours.

What you are here to see is not events that take place rather a study on the nature of mother-daughter relationship. Liv Ullman shines once again as the daughter who never lived up to her mother's expectations or so it seems. And Ingrid Bergman delivers a performance of a self-involved mother that proved her as one of the greatest talents of all time. Look for Bergman's classic close shots of characters with faces filling up the screen and demonstrating the kinds of emotions that you thought were too deep to surface. This is not just a movie-watching experience, it's a meditation on the nature of humanity itself.",

            "content": "This is the complex film of a troubled mother-daughter relationship.  The earlier comments lay the plot out better than I could, but they leave out one interesting thing.  The men in the film are treated as completely irrelevant, normally off to the side, aloof, smoking a pipe and reading the newspaper.  When confronted with any of the hyper-drama with which the stars of the film are consumed, they respond like half-wits in a kind \"Eh?  ah, yes, swell\" and go back to their newspapers as if they're not comprehending or interested in the story unfolding.  Liv Ulman's husband has moments of interesting presence, but otherwise the general statement stands.Most of the film is comprised of the emotional fist fight between the mother and daughter.  The issues they struggle with might have been more interesting if the mother had tried to explain herself more, but it's hard to take to heart the daughter's hysterical ranting that she despises her mother for making her get a haircut when she was younger.  For those who like drama in everything in their lives from buttering toast to playing a song on the piano, this film will hit the spot in the way that even a condensed season of soap operas could not.That said, the conflict didn't touch me as it obviously has the many others who have commented on this film.  The conflict seemed inflated, which, while it may be in itself realistic of real conflicts in the world, made the intricacies of the accusation free-for-all less interesting.  And the obsessive determination of the daughter to find sadness and oppression in everything, which again may be in itself realistic and an interesting look at someone of that nature, felt goofy.  At points the statements are so over the top with questions like \"Is my suffering your delight?\" the character felt more like a doomsday cartoon than an interesting person revealing fascinating existential truths to think about.In defense of the film, the director appeared to be intentionally portraying both characters as flawed.  But at the same time, I think we the audience were intended to sympathize with the daughter considerably more than I did. If the director was trying to say \"when you are desperately trying to find pain and sadness in everything, you will, and here's an example of that\" it might have been more interesting.  Or if it felt like an unsympathetic portrayal of people leading empty lives, it might have had a more substantive effect in the vein of, say, Requiem for a Dream.\nIn sum, I'd say the acting is good, the story very dramatic, and without the emptyness of modern CGI films.  But the drama itself felt empty to me, and didn't leave me thinking about the film after it was over, wondering about ideas the characters struggle with.  Many people love it, and even the Criterion Collection released the film, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  For heartfelt family drama -- albeit not mother-daughter drama -- I'd probably urge someone to see Cassavetes' Faces instead.",

In Autumn Sonata, we face this topic head on through the relationship of Eva and her concert pianist mother Charlotte Andergast.From the beginning we're introduced to Eva from the perspective of Viktor, her...something. I say this as we already get a feel for the dysfunction of Eva through her relationship with Viktor. Viktor tell us he loves Eva, though he thinks it's impossible to express this to her in words she'll believe, and so Eva's emotional stuntedness becomes immediately evident.Eva invites her mother over, and we're introduced to Charlotte who from the moment she's on screen is an endless well of chatter. We watch the awkward but quite jovial exchange of mother and daughter who both seem to hope for reconciliation and an ending of their multi-year estrangement. This hope is quickly tarnished when Charlotte finds that her younger daughter Helena, who suffers from some unnamed nerve disease, is living with and being taken care of by Eva. Through the interactions of Charlotte and her daughter Helena we find ourselves witnessing first hand Charlotte's general remoteness, and almost frustration, as she deals with her daughter much like how one would deal with a girlfriend they hadn't seen in a while than a loving compassionate mother. From here the movie starts to build like a storm with there being one drop here, another there, and suddenly we're soaked in the Eva's absolute hatred of her mother via a lengthy late night talk interspersed with flashbacks.When one deals with a topic such as emotional neglect, one deals in something highly subjective. The entire validity of such a condition is dependent on the emotional expressions of the one(s) suffering. What makes Autumn Sonata a fascinating film is the incredible work of Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman, who though the strength their performances alone (There is no score in this film unless you count a couple brief excerpts of standard classical piano repertoire.), manage to completely validate the emotional dysfunction of their respective characters and hence the script itself which could have very easily fallen into the pits of soap operatic campiness in the wrong hands.On a more personal note, I can't help but be reminded of a relatively recent documentary Bloody Daughter where Stephanie Argerich provides a window into the incredibly private life of her world renowned concert pianist mother, Martha Argerich, and their family life. There's no dramatic late night conversation, but many of the same emotional issues come up in this real life concert pianist mother and daughter relationship. As a musician myself I can't help but wonder if one is greatly dispositioned toward such screwed up relationships.Nonetheless, Autumn Sonata is a fantastic movie that rides on an exceptional amount of drama provided by it's two exceptional actresses. Watch and enjoy the one and only collaboration of the two great Bergmans.",

Or do some people never live? They just exist.\"\n2022 Millennials/Gen X: \"Honestly bro same.\"\n\nSomehow the only collaboration between legendary Swedish director Ingmar Bergman and equally legendary Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman (no relation), Autumn Sonata was not immediately hailed as a masterpiece by contemporary audiences, and it's somewhat understandable why - it combines more active dialogue (abandoning the lingering empty space that the director often used to great effect in the past) with a subjectively restrained visual composition (nearly all of the scenes take place in relatively nondescript Swedish houses). The film relies almost entirely on the dynamic between its two main characters, Ingrid Bergman's Charlotte and Liv Ullmann's Eva, a mother and daughter who gradually revisit the unresolved trauma of their pasts in a way that they had found more convenient to gloss over or forget. The brilliant aspect to their discord is that it feels organic and real while exploring (i.e., an actual conflict) while touching on two characters that are simultaneously flawed yet completely relatable. Charlotte represents personal ambition and self-fulfilment (at the expense of a sense of indifference and selfishness) while Eva is an embodiment of childhood trauma, an existence that didn't ask to be created before being left to fend emotionally for themselves (recognizing the limitations in holding onto the past, but unable to let go). \n\nThese are characters built on basic human principles and are executed well both in the screenplay and in front of the camera with top-notch performances, and they largely succeed in conveying the principles of basic human weakness and irreconcilable intergenerational differences. My only complaint (if you can call it that) about Autumn Sonata is that it feels very much like a cinematic adaptation of a theatrical play, even though the domestic discord source material doesn't necessitate any grand flourishes (and is likely better for not including any). Overall, still a very good component of the filmography of both Bergmans, which remains thematically sharp as all sincerely human dramas tend to. (4/5)",

Turning a blind eye to them in hope (or rather in belief) of them fading away with the passage of time as if they were merely bitter childhood memories would only further deepen and engraving them into the growing psyche, later coalescing into a distorted identity on the verge of collapse once the past unfolds, and grieving is the catalyst for that.\n\nThe theatrical origins of monologues writ large no matter how cinematically delivered and presented.

Wow, the mother really likes to talk about herself and make everything about her. She puts on a good show, but it's going to be really interesting to see if she really gets sentimental and breaks down and cries. I think mother's problem is that she swats away any sort of emotions, not letting herself feel sad or grieve or even mourn. It feels Eva wishes she was like her mother and her mother wishes that she could feel like Eva does. It's weird because they're mother and daughter, yet it seems like they are strangers to each other at times. It's almost like they can't be real and genuine in front of each other. They have walls up that neither of them are trying to break down. All Eva wanted was to feel love and care from her mother, but she was too busy with her piano and being somewhat selfish. The mother seems to be going around in circles with her past experiences but really what she needs to do is say she's sorry, and mean it. Sorry for leaving Eva and dad so often, sorry for neglecting Eva, sorry for not showing the love that Eva deserved. I think the worst part is the mother doesn't want to take responsibility, she's in denial. Almost like she doens't want to come to terms or is deluded that she didn't affect Eva's life and upbringing. It's crazy how Eva stripped her mother down with words, telling her everything she felt. It's so sad to see how hurt Eva is and how she basically has to be the mother in her situation taking care of Helena and talking so bluntly to her mother so that she can realize how badly she fucked up. The mother ran away like she always does, but now she knows how her daughter feels which now will make her suffer in guilt, in darkness and in emptiness knowing the pain and torment she caused to her two daughters out of neglect. Even with the daughter basically telling her that she was evil, she still wants to try to mend things and wants to make things better with her mother. But it's difficult when the mother doesn't want to come to terms with what she's done, she does brushes it aside and runs away - the one thing she's good at doing. So now the mother is going to live with this suffering for the rest of her life until she comes to terms with what she's done and says sorry. \n\nJeez this movie is melancholic as fuck. Quite depressingly real and raw. I thought it was a very interesting and realistic look at a the troubled relationship between a mother and daughter. This movie affected me on a very deep level and made me appreciate how good my relationship is with my parents. I thought the acting was powerfully done and honest. The dialogue was very smartly written, especially between the mother and daughter. It kept me in a trance and made the movie go by very quickly.

            "content": "A sincerely astonishing picture displaying familial struggles.\n\nIngmar Bergman's Swedish drama Autumn Sonata (1978) is a pensive reflection on life's relatable tensions between neglectful, narcissistic parents and their traumatized, depressed children. Ingmar Bergman is Sweden's greatest director, a visionary auteur with boundless creativity and heart to his beautiful arthouse films. Autumn Sonata is one of his most grounded with realistic emotions and vivid artistry. His direction is so striking for Autumn Sonata as his usual grimdark greys, whites, and blacks are replaced with warm Fall colors like orange, red, and yellow everywhere. He purposefully goes out of his way to connect viewers emotionally to this petulantly critical and selfish mother to her sweet, endearing, and hurt daughter. Bergman shoves you into this cozy Swedish home to reveal emotional trauma and pent up aggression over a lifetime of suffering and pain bottled up by these two women.\n\nIngmar Bergman's script may be the most resonant and real writing I've ever heard in a movie. His heartfelt words sincerely try to empathize with each lady through their past ordeals and current attitudes. Bergman writes with an authentic voice as the mind behind these Swedish ladies' troubled thoughts. Every line is full of dejected loneliness and desperate need for affection. Bergman makes Charlotte self absorbed, relating everything anguished heard back to herself and her own problems. Meanwhile, Bergman makes the daughter observe her mother's gluttony for attention as her own thoughts reflect her melancholy and regrets in a kindly manner. Autumn Sonata is fully realized as an intimate piece of art, dedicated to forcing the audience to confront hard emotional truths no matter the cost. Bergman writes monologue after monologue with vast knowledge and maturity gained from a life well lived and numerous brilliant features already establishing his innovative earnestness.\n\nLiv Ullmann is truly amazing as the daughter Eva full of sorrow over her terrible mother's toxic parenting and negligence. Her hurt eyes display deep sadness with every hateful glance at her mother. Ullmann brought tears to my eyes as she cried over her lost childhood and misgivings about her mother's coldness. Ullmann performs long speeches of emotional catharsis with a piercing gaze and perspective clarity. Liv is still stunningly beautiful and sweetly gentle as Eva. Liv Ullmann is up there with all of Sweden's greatest actresses like Ingrid Bergman, Greta Garbo, Bibi Andersson, and Rebecca Ferguson for her delightful realness and subtle dramatic acting prowess. I am in awe of Liv Ullmann's stark reality in her role as Eva in Autumn Sonata.\n\nIngrid Bergman is fantastic in her final film role as Eva's wretched mother and classical concert pianist Charlotte Andergast. Bergman is entertaining as she complains about everything and everyone around her. Furthermore, Ingrid Bergman is devastating as her character Charlotte is incapable of relating to her daughter sincerely as she cannot express any real emotion. Her breaking down is so gripping, like Ullmann's captivating lead performance stuffed with subtle pain, while Ingrid is outlandishly garish and mean in her criticisms. She gives Charlotte nuance and complexity, while remaining fully tacky as the cruel mother no child could love. I'm glad Ingrid Bergman finally got to act in Sweden's cinematic master Ingmar Bergman's classic pictures.\n\nLena Nyman is heartbreaking as the physically wheelchair bound daughter Helena with her agonized screams, longing to receive any genuine love or actual warmth from Ingrid Bergman's deviously apathetic maternal figure. Halvar Bjork is surprisingly sweet and quite patient with the rare nice husband in Ingmar Bergman's work. Gunnar Bjornstrand cameos at the end as Charlotte's manager Paul, but he merely nods and laughs. It was cute of Ingmar Bergman to cast his and Liv Ullmann's real daughter Linn Ullmann as the unhappy young Eva.\n\nI have to mention Sven Nykvist's gorgeous cinematography for Autumn Sonata. He makes everything warm with Fall vibes cozy Autumnal colors. His camera framing is strikingly symmetrical. He juxtaposes faces ready to burst into tears with brilliant close-ups. All his wide shots depict isolation in this snug Swedish abode. Sylvia Ingemarsson's editing is brilliant with hard cuts to past events. She gives Autumn Sonata an eerie atmosphere and dreamy mood. Ana Asp's production is cute and clever with her stately Swedish design method. Inger Pehrsson's costumes are stylish and pretty, especially Liv Ullmann's green dress. I adore the score within Autumn Sonata as Ingmar Bergman picks Schumann, Bach, Chopin, and Handel's classical compositions. They give Autumn Sonata an air of regality and more warmth than any previous Ingmar Bergman motion picture.\n\nIt's a shame that Autumn Sonata was Ingmar Bergman's final theatrical release, but I guess he left everything he had to say on the silver screen. I appreciate him getting Ingrid Bergman to play on screen with Liv Ullmann. I thank Ingmar for his stalwart service to cinema.",

The two main characters in the film are Charlotte (Bergman), the mother of two daughters, one of them being the other main character; Eva (Ullmann). Eva's husband Viktor (Bj\u00f6rk) and her sister Helena (Nyman) round out the supporting cast. Firstly, the acting in this film is brilliant from all involved. Ullmann's emotionally reclusive character is splendidly portrayed. Her solemn acting subtly shows the emotional weight Eva carries with her relationship with her mother and, to a lesser degree, her husband. Her crescendo-like performance is fully realised at the climax of the film. Bergman captures Charlotte's superior demeanour towards her daughter and her isolated and lonely attitude effectively. The character's selfish care free attitude is displayed subtly by Bergman eventually coming to a head at the climax of the film. The script is written well, but more time could have been given to the mother's point of view. Some of the daughter's accusations sometimes seem unfounded. There are too many threads in the film with feeling unresolved. The direction of the film is very good, especially in scenes where there are no edits and the scenes are just Bergman and Ullmann delivering their lines for more than five minutes. Ingrid Bergman was deservedly nominated for Best Actress, but lost to Jane Fonda for Coming Home. Out of the Best Actress nominees I saw for that year (Fonda, Bergman & Clayburgh), I believe Bergman was the best performer (the Academy in my view probably gave Fonda a \"career\" Oscar).",

It's still a flawed movie that is very uneventful, slow and ultimately very boring in its first half, but the second half is great as it features that amazing conversation which provides an emotional catharsis for the two women. The film's reliably well shot and it features great acting by Liv Ullmann and a terrific turn from Ingrid Bergman who ended her career on such a powerful note.",

This movie does have some of the pacing issues that I struggle with in other Bergman films. However, one of the advantages I see in Autumn Sonata is that it doesn\u2019t revel in silence. Instead people will talk to themselves or even directly to camera in order to keep you invested. I appreciated that, and I never got bored with Autumn Sonata. I have to give a lot of credit to remarkable performances from Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman. The movie would be almost unwatchable for me with lesser actresses. This is a style of movie I feel like I should despise, because I always hate when there is nothing but bickering for hours, but this was something different. It was a fracturing of a relationship between mother-and-daughter, it was a revelation of past pains, and it was devastating to watch. Every moment of the climactic scene in this film was heart-wrenching and powerful. I was enthralled and could not look away for even a moment. It didn\u2019t make Autumn Sonata into something that I loved, but it was a scene that I will never forget. This is a powerful film, and I enjoyed it more than I ever would have expected considering how many aspects of it I thought I would hate.",

However, in the last film is not sketched any nostalgia, on the contrary, it is a reunion there are several characteristics that marked the famous Swedish director.\n\nSuch as his strong relationship with the theater, with the actors, the use of symbols and metaphors, the simplicity of his locations (which he turns into a great advantage), the psychological character in formation and human relations, striking and challenging women , The expressiveness of a face in its close's and big close's and how much it speaks or even shouts moments of silence, moments when not verbalizing suggests so many things. As in the scene where Eva (Liv Ullman) plays a few notes on the piano for her mother, Charlotte (Ingrid Bergman), a magisterial and anthological moment, in the force and expressiveness of two actresses who say nothing on the scene but suggest a universe Of rivalries, misunderstandings and anguish in a (non) relation of mother and daughter.\n\nAutumn Sonata \"is a tragic burden of human emotion, and is mostly a drama of confessions between two women, who dialogue with each other, which ends up generating a certain monotonous production noise, especially by the subtle clash of the Seem to dominate much of the film, which may have been elaborated in an attempt to generate a frenzy in the audience for the climax, which is not necessary or even does not work, because in the invitation letter written by Eva and In the opening monologue performed by Eva's husband, it is already clear that there, it will be a place to settle accounts.\n\nIn addition to its musical allusion, the film's title keeps track of another central point: the idea of ?? seasons and cycles. It is clear the reference of this change of seasons in the photograph of Sven Nykvist who collaborates with his pale and washed palette and without great dependences of the artificial light, lamps and candles, call attention to the cold of the winter. However, in what seems to be a contradiction, many of Nykvist's scenes are garlands with flowers. They appear in dozens of scenes. Normally associated with spring, the presence of flowers is a clear reminder of the cyclical nature of life and our relationships with others. The cold will pass, suggest the flowers, we only have to endure this during the winter.\n\nFilled with distressing emotion and agonizing eyesight, \"Autumn Sonata\" offers a methodically potent examination of the pain we choose to keep inside, and the scars that remain with us as a result. Like most Bergman films, the image is replete with existential questions and gloomy reflections, deeply investigating the mysteries of the challenges inherent in life, and depending on the interpretation, the ending may offer some level of optimism and catharsis, the film's elegiac mood And almost impossible confessions of hating and indifference remain irrevocably haunting.\n\nAnother feature that Bergman has always been able to use, was his complete understanding that in the end, a film ends up always being the actors, they are the face and the memory of the film and they have the capacity to generate reciprocities with the public. So, Bergman is undoubtedly the director, but in the end, are Liv Ullman, Ingrid Bergman and Lena Nyman who play the Sonata.",

There is something about his films that appeals to me, so few are the times when I really don't like something he did(\"Tystnaden\",\"Through a glass darkly\" and \"Vargtimmen\" are the \"exceptions\"). Apart from this, before Tarantino gave it a modern spin or Woody Allen used it in his comedies, Bergman and Tarkovsky were the two directors that mastered the art of writings insightful dialogues and monologues. Because this is what shines in most of Bergman's films, since more often than not, he was a minimalist so as much as you could admire Sven Nykvist's camerawork, there is little much else to admire from an aesthetic standpoint.\n\nSomehow, Bergman appeals more to me than Tarkovsky does, at least in terms of dialogue: Tarkovsky is a bit too \"sweet\" for my liking.\nThere are two other aspects: one of them is linguistic and the other revolves around performances. \nI have seen other Swedish films as well(\"Let the right one in\", \"The girl with the dragon tattoo\" etc) yet in none of them have I found the Swedish language so appealing. In Bergman's films it has a particular melody almost tailored to fit their gloomy atmosphere.\n\nAlso, in terms of performances there is a contrast between what those performances depict and how they depict it(sometimes) and this is something some directors could learn from Bergman: sometimes moments of great emotional impact are best delivered in a cold manner and I am targeting especially those sappy melodramas in which the \"dramatic\" performances are laughable instead of dramatic. \n\n\"Autumn Sonata\" fits best the description above, so I can't really say much else.",

For some people, they had a happy childhood with no complaints, and this will all sound very foreign and probably overly dramatic. Other people had varying degrees of unhappiness in their childhood, and for those people Autumn Sonata will either hold up as a mirror to conversations they've had with their own parents, or resemble something they wish they could discuss.\n\nAutumn Sonata is the confrontation between a daughter and her mother. It's raw, inconsistent in the way real people are inconsistent, and shakes with bristling questions that go unanswered.\n\nAnd the movie creaks under the weight. At least for me, having heard these conversations between my father and his parents, everything here is painfully realistic. Or, the beginnings of something painfully realistic. These are good stepping-stone conversations. Essential conversations to rebuilding a relationship.\n\nBut what the film misses is a chance to explore the mother character much more deeply. She touches a bit on her childhood, and it sounds much like you'd expect based on her parenting style. (Or lackthereof, if you will.) But these dysfunctional issues flow pretty specifically from generation to generation. After all, if you grow up in a specific family dynamic, that is often your default reaction when placed in the parental role. (And if you're consciously trying to be not-that-parent, you might correct some issues, but not others, and go too far in correcting even other issues, creating a whole new problem.)\n\nSo what Autumn Sonata could have done to really make it a powerhouse would be to better showcase the generational links.\n\nRegardless, this is a film that I definitely would not consider fun to watch. But it is a very good film that tackles issues I rarely seen addressed in cinema in a realistic way.",

But then you have the icing on the cake in the form of Ingrid Bergman. How this performance didn't get her an Oscar I have no idea. Dare I say it? She actually outshines the director. The story is 'the standard'- existential angst played through the medium of family dysfunction and life's exquisite little cruelties, but no less affecting for it. To love is to suffer, and vice versa. Would that there was anyone around now painting characters in such vivid colours.\n\nTHIS is the real 3D, as in characterisation. There are no easy sketches here. Everyone is complex. Everyone is selfish, cruel, neurotic. Life is unbearable pain, often physically so. Everything that needs to be said is left unsaid until it is too late. And yet, is there any experience as life affirming as watching this manifesto nailed to the wall in front of your eyes in celluloid? I don't think so. Half a star removed for the Erik subplot which I thought was perhaps gilding the lily, somewhat.\n\nBut really, this film is just amazing.",

            "content": "Here's a film that affected me deep to my core. The screenplay, direction, performances, and cinematography were all in line to deliver one of Bergman's best. The basic idea is that a mother comes to visit a daughter she hasn't seen in a long time. These two have deeper problems than they want to admit to themselves until things stir up inside of them. Ingrid Bergman plays Charlotte; a mother who abandoned her family to pursue her career as a pianist. Liv Ullman plays Eva; the daughter who of Charlotte who has troubles coming to terms with her mother and her childhood. The two women are legitimately happy to see each other again, since it's been such a long time. They lie to themselves that everything can be perfect; they can look past everything that happened and just be happy to be together. It all starts when Eva realizes Charlotte would not have come for a visit if she knew Helena would be present. You see, Helena is her daughter that she put in a nursing home once she became handicapped, but Eva brought her home after feeling that she would be happier there. And her own mother didn't want to see her. Eva starts to think that maybe things won't be different. We get the full scaled effect when Eva plays the piano for her mother and realizes things are the same as they've always been. Her mother doesn't seem too pleased (even though we see her reaction and for me it's still hard to say why she seems torn up while Eva plays the piano) and it bothers her. It's her own interpretation. Then her mom plays the same thing and it's masterful. I think deep inside, Eva is drawn in amazement to her mother just like when she was a little girl, but she doesn't want to admit this so it makes her angry. When she was a child, her mother would go on tour for months, or she would practice her piano 6 hours a day and never want to be bothered. She consumed her life with her music. This led to neglect, which is why Eva says that Helena has been handicapped. Again, people say that this is similar to Bergman's feelings towards his father. It's set in a country house much like one he grew up in when his father first became a pastor. Helena represents the handicap he felt as a child. Eva probably represents him being neglected by his father when he was consumed with his religion and his troubles to find love. Charlotte would represent his father. But here it's interesting. There's not just one side to this. It's a difficult story for both. When Charlotte gave up the piano she thought she did well by her family. But Eva tells her she was too domineering and the summe when she was 14 was horrible. She didn't like that her mother was always gone, and she didn't like when her mother was around. She doesn't know how to reconcile these feelings. Autumn Sonata is a lot of talking between the two characters. They tell us their side of the story, their feelings at the time, and the outbursts they just can't hold in any longer. It almost seems like Bergman put himself in Charlotte and tried to understand his father a little more here. Autumn Sonata is a flat out masterpiece that's not to be missed.",

Liv Ullmann decides that now would be a good time to invite her mom Ingrid Bergman over after Ingrid's lover died. The two are very excited to see each other, and though a wound opens for Ingrid when she finds out her crippled daughter Lena Nyman lives with Liv, she accepts it, and catches up on the things she missed considering the family hasn't seen each other for seven years. The peace doesn't last long at all though-- we find out that Ingrid chose her life as a concert pianist over her family, and left Liv feeling miserable and Lena well-- you'll find out later what Ingrid did to her. Liv can't hold her feelings any longer though when she's reminded of her mother's old ways, and the two argue overnight. Woody Allen has said that Bergman is the only director ever capable to capture art and put it on the screen, and after seeing \"H\u00f6stsonaten\", I realized this was the perfect statement for the director. Indeed, Bergman has been artistic in the past, but this is tops. The \"autumn\" from the title obviously derives from the use of color, and Bergman uses only the fall leave colors for everything, 90% of the time, capturing the season as well as the moods Ingrid and Liv present in their performances. Though them and the script can be a bit melodramatic at times, somehow, this film does not end up in the annoying soap opera genre. Bergman gives her last phenomenal performance in this movie (her last Oscar nod came from this, too), Ullmann is heartbreaking in her role, and \"porn star\" Nyman proves she can act very well. All three of these actors should have gotten nominated for an Oscar, and lucky for Bergman, she snagged it. \"H\u00f6stsonaten\" is an excellent late Bergman/Bergman film that is truly worth the time to watch.

Eva leads a quiet life along a Norwegian fjord with her priest husband Viktor (Halvar Bj\u00f6rk), while Charlotte is a famed pianist who travels the world for concerts. When Charlotte comes to visit, Eva is initially joyful, but within just a few hours all of Eva's bottled up emotions spill over. Some remarkable flashbacks reveal the betrayals that Charlotte inflicted on her family while pursuing her career (they feature Erland Josefsson as Eva's father, through in a silent role). As mother and daughter bicker, weep and confess their sins, one might expect a happy ending. Bergman provides something rather different, however, and it undoubtedly will make some viewers furious. Nonetheless, I enjoy the film's observation that in real life, not all attempts at resolution between two people are successful.\n\nBergman has tended to portray priests either as pure evil (FANNY OCH ALEXANDER, DET SJUNDE INSEGLET), or good but very tormented (NATTVARDSGAESTERNA). Here, it's refreshing to see the vicar as a humble, content fellow and a loving husband. Lena Nyman's role as Eva's disabled sister is convincingly played, and the pain Bergman communicates through this part is devastating. The script includes a number of very quotable lines. There's been a tendency to treat the several film Bergman produced between the mid-1970s and FANNY OCH ALEXANDER as minor, but I would rank HOSTSONATEN among his best work.",

            "content": "The Only Double Bergman Film  \r\n\r\nIn a lot of negative reviews, I tend to say things like \"while I have no problem with movies that are just character studies . . . .\"  Or whatever is relevant to my problem with the movie.  I read a defense today of [i]Jeanne Dielman[/i], which I hated, and this shares some of that movie's slow nature.  What it has, however, is a raw emotional force.  These are women in pain.  They have been suffering for many years, each thinking they are contributing to the other's happiness.  This, I think, is a theme with Bergman films.  The first of his movies that I saw was [i]Cries and Whispers[/i], also starring Liv Ullmann, also the study of a relationship.  Here, however, she is not reconciling with her sisters.  She is reconciling with her mother, the great Ingrid Bergman, and in true Ingmar Bergman fashion, she is reconciling with herself at the same time.  Honestly, his movies may be best when they're character studies.\r\n\r\nUllmann is Eva, the wife of a simple country parson, Viktor (Halvar Bj\u00f6rk).  Her stepfather, Leonardo (Georg L\u00f8kkeberg), has just died, and her mother, Charlotte Andergast (Ingrid Bergman), is coming to visit for the first time in seven years.  She has not told Charlotte that her sister, Helena (Lena Nyman), will be there; Charlotte cannot handle her daughter's illness, which is never named but which seems like something in the nature of multiple sclerosis.  Eva and Viktor lost a son the day before his fourth birthday, when he drowned, and Charlotte never met him.  Charlotte changes her mind about how long she will stay with Eva and Viktor because she cannot stay in the same house as Helena.  And then Charlotte wakes from a nightmare, and Eva runs to comfort her.  And the two women talk, each telling the other all the things which haven't been said in all the lost and empty years.  Things which can never be unsaid.  \r\n\r\nIngmar Bergman believed that the human soul is read, and so it is worth noting that one of our first lingering views in this movie is on a bush of faded red roses.  Charlotte comes down to dinner wearing a bright red dress.  In fact, the DVD itself is red, though I'm not sure why.  But this movie, as with the other Bergman I've watched, is about baring the soul.  It turns out that both Eva and Charlotte think that the other is harsh and unfeeling.  Each reveals her feelings, and there are flashbacks showing what life was like before Eva was married, before the distancing between mother and daughters.  It rapidly becomes apparent that Charlotte wasn't really paying attention to the world outside her head and her music.  She did not notice the person her daughter actually was, choosing instead to shape her daughter into the person she wanted her daughter to be.  And she didn't want the sick daughter at all, of course.  Helena wears no red.\r\n\r\nThis was, of course, Ingrid Bergman's last film appearance.  She was actually old enough to be Liv Ullmann's mother, and Liv Ullmann was not in her first youth when this movie was made.  However, both women are still beautiful.  No, it's not the beauty of Ilsa Lund.  It is instead a beauty which has weathered much.  After all, Ingrid Bergman's life was not exactly a non-stop party.  The years of strain show on her face, but it is clear that they have made her stronger instead of breaking her.  Charlotte seems to have managed more because she doesn't let things touch her.  Eva calls her emotionally broken, and Ingmar Bergman lights her so the lines are more prominent, which I'm sure thrilled Ingrid.  It also appears that Eva is afraid of her own beauty, which is probably why she wears such unflattering clothes and glasses.  I'm aware there's this cult about the beauty of Swedish women, but I'm not talking about wanting to see these women, even in their youths, in bikinis.  They just have a placidity, really, and extremely pleasing features.\r\n\r\nEva now believes that she will never see her mother again.  She believes honesty has now driven her mother away completely.  Viktor cannot entirely disagree.  And Helena is pretty much ignored, even when she's crawling on the floor and calling for her mother.  I do not believe that Helena's illness is psychosomatic.  I do not believe it is caused by her mother's neglect.  But I do believe that her mother makes things worse.  What's more, I don't think having all this out in the open earlier would have kept the distance from forming.  Realistically, I'm not even sure it would have kept Eva from wearing clothing she didn't like when she was younger.  Eva grew up so aware of her mother's moods that she didn't feel allowed to have her own, and it has ended in her marrying a man she didn't love.  And I suspect, based on what happens, that there are a couple of pretty major aspects of her life that she never told that man, either.  Honesty can be painful, and Eva has just discovered exactly how painful.  She may not want to continue the experiment.",
