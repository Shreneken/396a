        "If you are at all interested in the history of cinema, or the influence of 20th century politics on the medium, then this film is a must-see, although over an hour of Soviet propaganda is likely to test the patience of modern viewers.",
        "One of the fundamental landmarks of cinema.",
        "Eisenstein's film still has a hypnotic urgency.",
        "It\u2019s propaganda, yet of the most artistic variety.",
        "Potemkin is a vital viewing experience that transcends its landmark/milestone status. Its virtuoso technique remains dazzling and is at the service of a revolutionary fervour we can still experience.",
        "A persistently political work salvaged by its unforgettable grasp of motion.",
        "Battleship Potemkin remains remarkable for the way it builds over a brisk 69 minutes, setting the pace for nearly every action movie made since.",
        "Heralded as one of the most blisteringly influential films of all time, Eisenstein\u2019s propaganda film has left an indelible scar on the establishment of film as art.",
        "If you only ever see one silent film, this is the one it should be. A masterpiece.",
        "It\u2019s required viewing in virtually every Film 101 class. Look at any MTV video or any slick million- dollar minute of advertising, and you\u2019ll see its origins in that assemblage of shots in Potemkin.",
        "To this day one of the most riveting, horrific, and empathetically turbocharged pieces of motion picture history ever recorded, Eisenstein's mind-bogglingly complex composition \u2013 utilizing a seeming cast of thousands of extras in addition to the unnamed, iconic main figures \u2013 is a gory ballet of marching Cossacks, frantic Odessites, trampled innocence, and doomed dissent.",
        "Let it suffice to say that if you've heard something about \u201cmontage\u201d (the joining of filmed images to suggest an idea, create a mood, or evoke a theme), this is the work that defines it.",
        "Eisenstein\u2019s account of the 1905 rebellion aboard a Russian battleship has been endlessly pored over and broken down, analyzed shot by shot to illustrate the filmmaker\u2019s adherence to Soviet theories of montage. But what can get lost in the close readings, to say nothing of the innumerable homages to the film\u2019s climactic Odessa Steps sequence, is how radical -- and how thrilling -- Eisenstein\u2019s techniques remain.",
        "Battleship Potemkin is first and foremost an action drama, a work of straightforward emotion and pulse-quickening tension.",
        "Whether or not one is disposed to accept all the details as a faithful record, the fact remains that it is a production in which the director displays a vivid imagination and an artistic appreciation of motion picture values.",
        "Few films rival its ability to capture the danger, drama, uncertainty and energy of civil war or to respond so vitally to the urgent artistic challenges of their times.",
        "For all Potemkin\u2019s rabble-rousing propaganda, Eisenstein\u2019s aestheticism is everywhere apparent.",
        "A vibrant, cinematically radical, and extremely accomplished work which went on to become one of the most celebrated movies ever made."

            "content": "Battleship Potemkin (1925) is a silent film that is often considered one of the most influential propaganda films as well as one of the greatest films of all time. The film is a Russian revolutionary propaganda film and involves sailors, who are treated subhuman, causing them to mutiny and stand up to their inhumane circumstances. The crew must endure many hardships in their struggle for fair treatment and go on to inspire countless others to stand up to the oppressive ways of the ruling government. The film's Director, Sergei Eisenstein, used the film as an experiment in his theories of montage and it is used in several different ways throughout the films five segments. While Eisenstein certainly isn't the only Director to use montage in his films, the emotional impact felt from these sequences are truly timeless and hugely influential. I have seen many propaganda films in my lifetime but Battleship Potemkin remains with me as such a powerful and inspiring piece of the genre in its strong and powerful message.\nMuch of the flow and feel of the film is reminiscence of the propaganda genre but the original use of montage is on display in the film and while elaborated on in later films, is the most pivotal in Battleship Potemkin. At times the film may come off to some as preachy or very direct but in terms of propaganda films it gets the message across with set pieces that are edited together using montage to great effect, both visually and emotionally. As a propaganda film it uses the plea to basic human rights and liberties to show the audience its message in a very real way. At the core of every propaganda film is a desire to express a message and to portray it in such a way as to inspire those that stand for the cause and convince or plea to the hearts of those that don't yet. The emotional pull touches each and every viewer with its depiction of innocence and fairness being taken away from the citizens and even military personnel. The film does a very good job of balancing the message of the film with just letting the events play out and the viewer making a decision on the matter themselves. Battleship Potemkin is one of the greatest films and remains such nearly ninety years later due to its wonderful balance and dramatic use of montage by the films gifted Director. To truly appreciate it's brilliance you have to view the film and make your own analysis of the message and the film lets you do this without prompting you with bias agendas.\nWhat an amazing feat for cinema in 1925 and is still today considered an essential piece of film history. Truly shocking and graphic for the day, the film is filled with tense and gripping imagery and a score that follows closely to really build the tension. The red flag, which was hand colored onto the original negative was an amazing symbolic image that really added something special to the film and it's message! Highly Recommended if you are into film and want to know one of the most influential and loved films of all time!",

This Soviet silent film from 1925 held my attention pretty well considering the preceding words in this sentence.\n\nPotemkin can be watched from a variety of angles, three of which I probably found myself focusing on most. The first was as a literal recollection of events, just as you would appreciate any fact based film or biopic for the knowledge gained from it.\n\nI also found Potemkin interesting as a historical document or primary source, as we can look at the film in the context of what we know today and fairly question how much of the content is factually accurate vs political propaganda.\n\nIt was also hard to watch this film without recognizing the technical achievement on display. Einstein offered some impressive shots and was able to create a succinct story line. This was also apparently one of the first films in which montage was utilized. The sound design and Shostakovich influenced score helped bring it all together, creating an adequate form of emotional cues in the absence of dialogue.\n\nThis is hard to rate because while not necessarily enjoyable at face value as a typical movie watch, it is definitely interesting, especially for Russian history fans such as myself.",

While the movie is admittedly short on any kind of character development, this may have been Eisenstein's point \u2013 the story is about revolution and the Russian proletariat, which was greater than any specific individual.

            "content": "Film Description (SPOILERS)\nBattleship Potemkin is a film about a mistreated military ship crew that mutinies against the captain who kills a rebel leader and ignites an uprising of the whole town of Odessa against the government.\n\nAbout The Film\nIn 1925, the production company Mosfilm of the USSR released the silent motion picture, Battleship Potemkin. Though silent the film has Russian intertitles laced through it. Sergei Eisenstein is the director and his execution of Battleship Potemkin cemented his place as one of the greatest film directors of all time. The film is regularly quoted as the favorite film of many great modern film directors and for good reason: the film is a masterpiece. \n\nPros/Cons (SPOILERS)\nNo scene is wasted when it comes to visual metaphor in Battleship Potemkin. This film does this with exquisite subtlety and continuity. It is this quality that puts this film at the top of any movie buff's list. Any scene could be chosen as an example so I will choose my favorite. This particular scene is very spiritual despite the anti-religious theme that was woven throughout the narrative. It takes place in Act III: Rebel leader Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov), who is killed during the mutiny, is laid to rest in a tent by the harbor. The camera is shooting from Vakulinchuk's perspective inside the tent facing towards the opening flap. You see the harbor, sail boats, and bright sky through the opening. His lifeless body stretches from the bottom center of the screen making it seem like his toes are touching the edge of the harbor. Directly above the body is a reflection of the sun glittering on the surface of the water. The entire movie uses water as a representation of emotion and subconscious. The calmness of the water subconsciously makes you feel tranquil and mirrors the peace of death This shimmery light, especially being placed over his body, is a visual metaphor of Vakulinchuk's soul. It seems to be hovering above his body as if saying goodbye. Soon a ship starts to creep into view from the left side of the tent opening. It is a dark silhouette that slowly passes over the opening and soon swallows the screen in darkness and the water shimmers no more. This visual narrative suggests that this spirit has left and only darkness remains. Since the object that eclipses the light is a sail boat it feels as though this soul has been picked up by this new vessel and is ready for the next adventure.\nWhat could be a point of weakness for some people in this film is perhaps the attack of religion since many people are religious. I think since Eisenstein seems to allude to the spirit he does not deny the existence of a higher power but is only criticizing institutionalized and weaponized religion. In the movie you can see that the priest was on the side of the oppressors and used to manipulate people emotionally into subordination. I think this nuance could potentially be hard to grasp at first for some people but it is also why I think the movie is brilliant. \n\nMeaning and Value\nEisenstein meant to create a film that glorified revolutions and overthrowing oppressors. It was propaganda for the working class to stand up to mistreatment and tyranny. In the world today many people have been standing up to the tyrants of the world. Globally people are protesting and rioting in an unprecedented simultaneous way. I think Battleship Potemkin speaks to the current mood of our lives right now. I think it is important for everybody to watch the film today to realize that a just society is not something you can just keep when you have it\u2014 it must be upheld and watched vigilantly. Oppressors of all forms have always existed to find any means necessary to take power. This film is evidence to this pattern of history as well as a call to action towards the oppressed. \n\nShould You Watch This Film?\nI think everybody should watch this film. It should be mandatory in every film class just to be exposed to masterful film making. Realistically, this may not be the film for someone that looks for more surface level entertainment from their films. It is definitely not for kids and may even be too challenging for some teenagers. Many people may not be into heady black and white silent films. I was never into the silent or black and white films until I this movie changed that for me. \n\nRating\nThe influence of this film still reaches the silver screen to this day. Every scene was layered and meticulously engineered by intelligent and crafty artists of cinema. It's themes stand the test of time. While all this that is amazing I think the fact that it is also an entertaining story is what makes it a success. I give Battleship Potemkin five stars out of five.",

The montage editing techniques have influenced several fils since it's release. The imagery can be haunting with it's brutality and realism. There may not be an abundance of characters to follow, but the way the story is told, there is not a very strong need for characters.

If this shit went on back then, which I imagine it did since they're making a movie about it, this is completely cruel and disgusting. \n\nTaking justice into their own hands from dictator-like captains and officers on a ship is the main message in this movie. Although the message is clear and important, I couldn't help but doze off a couple times during the movie. And it's not the movies fault, it was just the time that it was made. The limitations of the movie - it being a silent movie and all and the cinematography is obviously limited too because of the tight spaces and the lack of technological advances. I do have to say though, the director and production made the best of what they had. The editing and scene changes are amazing. \n\nThat's so ballsy to make a statement by putting a dead mans's body on display for all the townsfolk to see what injustice was committed. It's incredible to see how the whole city came to pay their respects to the deceased sailor. That town massacre scene was brutal. \n\nThis is a pretty optimistic view of people standing up and rising up for justice. But nowadays this kind of shit wouldn't happen. Everyone's too accustomed to the life that they're living and they're comfortably numb. The only way people would come together and do an uprising like in this movie is if the system completely disrupted the people's way of living. \n\nI imagine this was a pretty revelatory and mind-blowing movie when it came out since nothing like this had been made. But with that being said, I'm not a big fan of silent movies. With the exception of Charlie Chaplin movies and the movie Vampyr (which was a movie that stood on it's own and didn't really need voice acting). But overall it was a pretty interesting movie with some nice surprises and a great message.",

Indeed, when we're watching this film it's hard to believe that was shot in distant 1925. However, Battleship Potemkin should not be viewed as a museum artifact. Today, as almost one hundred years ago, it calls to revolt against oppression and oppressors, and its powerful propaganda message carries the energy of not only the past but also the future revolutions.\n\nIn 1918 Sergei Eisenstein left the studies of architecture and joined the Russian Revolution, where he became a revolutionary propagandist. Together with Dziga Vertov and others he developed a new cinematic language that went out to change the cinema forever. Eisenstein wanted to stir the emotions and inspire viewers of his short films, and in this way to put the new art, cinematography, in the service of the Revolution. By far the strongest and longest lasting effects achieved his feature films Strike, October and above all Battleship Potemkin which soon upon release inspired hundreds of thousands of viewers, among them hundreds of future film directors. Luis Bu\u00c3\u00b1uel said that this movie changed his life and decisively influenced his decision to become a film director.\n\nHistorically, sailors' mutiny on the imperial Russian military ship \"Potemkin\" of June 27, foretold the first, unsuccessful, Russian revolution that erupted in October 1905, and was crushed in December that same year.\n\nDuring the Russo-Japanese War of 1904/05 most of the sailors of the Black Sea fleet were transferred to the Pacific, leaving ships with mostly inexperienced recruits and less capable officers. In this situation, the Central Committee of the Social Democratic Organization of the Black Sea Fleet, called \"Tsentralka\" made a decision to start preparations for the simultaneous revolt on all ships of the Black Sea Fleet. The first rebellion erupted on \"Potemkin\", when on 27 June 1905, the deputy commander of the ship threatened to shot sailors who refused to eat maggoty meat. After a short struggle sailors took control of the ship and on the same evening sailed in Odessa flying a red flag.\n\nBased on actual events.",

The mutiny starts an uprising against the tsarist government among the people of Odessa.  However, the government sends a squadron of warships to bring the crew of the Potemkin to heel.   Things look grim for the crew.\n\nDirected by Sergei Eisenstein, Battleship Potemkin is not just a landmark film in history, for its cinematic innovations, but a great film full stop.   Great action, empathetic characters and plot and a fantastic cliff-hanger at the end.\n\nEisenstein's main contribution to cinematic development was 'Soviet montage theory': through clever editing, the viewer is drawn into and carried along with the scene.  A great example of this in Battleship Potemkin is the soldiers vs townsfolk scene on the steps.  Through dozens of mini-scenes within the main scene, the dynamism, panic and horror of the situation are conveyed to the audience.",

The whole spectacle is inflammatory, even for those unfamiliar with the historical context.

However, what undoubtedly stirred emotions in 1925 - possibly sympathy for the communist movement, or fear of inciting revolutionary thoughts given the mutiny that takes place on the Potemkin, or squeamishness at the moments of violence (all of which contributed to the film being banned in many countries, including the Soviet Union!) - is less impactful ninety years later.

The story takes place in June of 1905 on the battleship well Potemkin, we see the crew of the ship are not so happy and they are revolted by the standards they have and so they stick up for themselves and when fellow crew members are nearly killed by their own officers, it seems quite the time for the crew to get up and fight. It is a dramatized version of true events but this movie really pumps up the workers as complete heroes, I mean this movie is Soviet propaganda through and through, but it's superbly well made even if it is.\n\nThe man behind this perfectly crafted motion picture is Sergei Eisenstein who directs this in a way which even when it's going very slow still manages to either be thrilling or throw in some kind of thing to make it so amazing. I think what he also does is create a movie that isn't just for critics to feast their eyes on, this can be enjoyed by anyone I swear and it's actually a genuinely exciting kind of movie, although I would always watch a few silent movies beforehand so that you get the right feel of this. What Eisenstein also does is bring in all the crafts that make up a film and creates an art piece, one that's cameras are perfectly working, editing is finely tuned, dialogue (even for a silent movie) is great and then utilises production design especially in the famous \"Odessa Steps\" scene where the outfits and the general look of the scene looks amazing.\n\nThis is so often placed on the lists that people compile with the greatest movies and for good reason, the reasons become even more so when you consider this was made in 1925 and it is silent, but you never truly think about that and this doesn't seem to have aged at all, in fact other than the cast the only expired thing is the Soviet Union. Yet again it is Eisenstein who makes it ageless, I felt he just knew what he wanted and did it, made a film that although is made for a certain political position, can still entertain no matter what your views on politics.\n\nI feel that again those steps are like come on, I mean those boots are just a brilliant cinematic piece. The scene is one that is thrilling yet also oddly touching with a little added darkness (well OK make that quite a bit). The choreography of the entire scene is marvellous too with the enormous cast to run and fall down it not only makes it incredible to see but you'd think also really dangerous! Don't watch this just for this scene I mean this has sublime scenes elsewhere, take for example the ending which of course I won't spoil but when you think one thing it does something else and builds you up until you are really excited to see what happens next. \n\nI think that if you consider this not your kind of film then think again, this isn't a movie that should only be shown in history classes or film studying lectures, it's a movie that should be seen because it is entertaining but also technically a film of flawless dimensions. Yes feast in what Soviet cinema has to offer and maybe you might like it quite a bit, in fact you might even be accustomed to raising a red flag above your house even if the neighbour calls you a commie.",

As a propaganda film it shamelessly depicts its antagonists as cruel snobs who care nothing for those below themselves, and gives them no redeeming features whatsoever. Most of them don't even have names. Without paying even close attention, many of the technical cracks are plain to see. It's integration of stock footage and even cutaway shots to what looks like a toy ship floating in a tub of water against a grey backdrop seem especially silly by today's standards, but what still holds up are its themes and morals. Much like The Bicycle Thief, another masterpiece, simple human desires, in this case the craving for liberation and fair treatment, appear small at first, but the film cleverly amplifies them to the point where you can feel them in every moment. The Odessa Step sequence, a scene that bears the drool marks of film historians and directors the world over, still holds up very well, existing as a hallmark of directing, camera-work, editing and stark, often brutal imagery. It's not the kind of film you would watch on a regular basis, especially if entertainment is all you seek, but with ever-relevant themes, a stirring musical score and surprising tension and emotional heft, Battleship Potemkin is rightly regarded as a piece of seminal cinema.",

Obviously the context of the film is incredibly important, and it is vital to note that this is a propaganda film. That being said, there aren't really characters. It's like there were just two: the people and the soldiers. The stair scene is just as legendary as it is hailed to be. Halfway through it I noticed my jaw was dropped open as much as possible. I've been watching early films lately and I must say that the violence is shocking. It's not especially graphic or even realistically performed, but the reasons they have to start fighting and the quickness of it was jarring. These soldiers just gunning down civilians was incredibly disturbing and I can't believe that that is a thing that happened, and continues to happen. There were a lot of creative angles and techniques used, absolutely. Just the way the story was told left me guessing a lot. Wasn't a lot of build-up to action, it was just suddenly inaction to action- and since I didn't know what was going on all the time, it was really confusing. Just not a format I'm used to, but I'm working on it.\n\nThere were so many points where I was like \"okay, I GET IT\" like so many repetitive shots and close-ups held for far too long. There were a lot of shots that should have been cut shorter because it would continue on even after the characters were mostly out of frame. There was one scene where two people walk away and the scene keeps going until all we can see is their ankles and I was like, \"ok, what do these ankles symbolize\" Just kidding, haha, I mean I can't knock this film too much because it's truly an important part of the foundation of modern cinema, and these guys were out there with nothing but ideas and some film equipment. They didn't have film schools, they didn't have movies to watch and study, they didn't have books about filmmaking. I do appreciate this movie's contribution to film but I did not have a good time watching this film. The story didn't do it for me and the shooting style was extremely frustrating to watch. The stair scene is worth a viewing, but I don't intend to watch this again. Not sure why any government would endorse/pay for this, but I'll never pretend to understand Russia. \n\nDid I enjoy it?

            "content": "The quintessential propaganda movie. So this is about the crew of a Russian ship, the Potemkin.  When there is a disagreement regarding the quality of the food that is being served, it directly leads to a mutiny, which indirectly leads to an uprising against the Russian overlords.  Speaking plainly, it is a bit difficult to approach reviews for old school classics such as this one, because there are a few questions that I feel that I am required to address when I go about critiquing.  Is this mandatory viewing for any film lover?  Absolutely, and with good reason.  Over at theyshootpictures.com, a place where I occasionally go for classier (and sometimes snootier) film recommendations, this is ranked as the 11th best movie of all time, and that is not without merit, especially from a technical standpoint.  Does this demand multiple viewings?  I'm pretty certain I will see this again at some point in my life, but I have no inherent desire to rewatch this.  Does it play well to today's modern audience who can't stand in a line for more than 45 seconds without checking their smart phones?  Well, I wouldn't necessarily go that far.  I've dabbled a bit in silent films, but it's hard to deny: almost every silent movie feels about twice its length due to modern film and television desensitizing our attention span.  With shorts, it's not that big of a deal, but for full length features, you do feel it, even if it's a modest 69 minutes like this one is.  With Battleship Potemkin, they made the smart decision to divide this into five definitive chapters, all of which feel like their own personal segment.  This allows you to pace yourself, which puts your A.D.D. at ease.  The first three chapters are all well and good, but they aren't what you talk about once you walk away from it, as they are mostly setup.  The last two chapters are where this feature truly shines, most notably with The Steps of Odessa.  This isn't just a massacre, it's an ambush, so much so that you, as an audience member, are taken aback with how jarring the tonal shift is.  It's one of the first montages in cinema, and it is unnerving, even in the year 2014; seeing this relentless opposition bear down on innocent bystanders would be disturbing even in a non-propaganda movie.  Also, in the fifth chapter, it features honest to God tension that keeps building and building to music that continues to crescendo until the point that you're ready to yell at the screen, and it's pretty impressive that a movie that is this old can still be so affecting.  The print on Netflix is very crisp, and there is plenty of memorable imagery to be found here.  Even without the context, the propaganda effect is not lost; the flashing of fast title cards that read, \"the land is ours\" and \"tomorrow is ours\" leave an imprint in your brain, whether it be on a conscious or a subconscious level.  Should you watch this?  Yes, it's 100% required viewing, if only to see what we came from in cinema.",

It is a hard film to watch, but you can see what films it went on to influence and why film critics swear by this film, but that's made it feel less special than it is. The film is told in 5 episodes, 'Men and Maggots', where the crew of the Battleship Potemkin live in squalid conditions and are given rancid food, 'Drama on Deck' shows the crew having lost patience with the conditions, and leading a mutiny against their leader Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov). In 'A Dead Man Calls for Justice', the people of Odessa mourn over the death of Vakulinchuk, then in 'The Odessa Staircase', Tsarist soldiers turn on the people of Odessa, causing a bloody massacre. Then in 'The Rendez-Vous with the Squadron', another battleship is sent to intercept the Potemkin, only for both ships to join together in mutiny. The film requires a knowledge of what was going on in Russia at the time, it looks good but it's heavy going and it's not one you can watch again in a hurry. It was banned for nearly 30 years in the UK for \"inflammatory subtitles and Bolshevist Propaganda, which just goes to show how paranoid people were against Communism back then.",

I'm a bit surprised that the US ever allowed it to be shown due to its philosophical support of communism.  However, it should be seen and studied by everyone so as to keep democracies from succumbing to the same sort of propaganda - and likewise to understand the elements that create such a populist revolution.

            "content": "Battleship Potemkin the Propaganda of the Montage \nBattleship Potemkin is a Russian silent film made in 1925, directed by the great Soviets filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein. The story in this film is based on a true events during the revolution in The Unions Soviets. In 1905, protest of workers begin against the regime. A ship full of officers called Potemkin. Some officers have decide to punishment a few rebel workers, then the some officers refuse to do so, and they take over the ship. When they return to the city they found out that there was a thousand civilians been shot and killed by the regime, many others wounded. The film is considered one of the best classical film in history of cinema in the silent era. The scene were a baby in a carriage falling down the stairs is truly the beginning of many new montage theories in cinema.\nAs Dylan Hintz claims in his essay \"Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 masterpiece of Soviet Montage, The Battleship Potemkin. This statement links clashing close up images of water crashing upon rocks- a natural violence of warlike proportions displayed to give the viewer a feeling of great chaos- to the entirety of the film in a message and theme of collision and amassed disturbance\". In this film the montage, unlike Griffith films in the United States, we find that the cuts designed to deliver a message of the revolutionary propaganda. The montage is confusing to the eye but attractive to the mind. The most important is the way montage pieces were puts together. thats way this film is significant to the history of the cinema. Is this film about political propaganda, I don't think so. To the cinema, this film encourages the filmmakers around the world to use the montage to do they own propaganda. \n\tIt is a difficult to be make a film that has a lot of affect in the moviegoers during  the silent  period. The Russians directors such as Einstein among with others find away to be more able to exploit the story using the montage as highest artistic value to make remarkable films. We see the cinema in France such as Lumiere Brothers, George Melies never try to play with the montage. In the other side of the world we see also the American filmmakers such as Griffith and Edson, using the traditional classic ways of montage. Einstein with his vision, was able to create something different in the montage. The technique he makes in the editing has lots of impacts and  influential to the public. The shoot mixing with powerful montage are capable to send the philosophy and the ideas of the film esay to the audience. Looking to part of this essay by Gregg Severson \"Eisenstein is creating a narrative film, and Hough purports to write a history, but both are stories of the event with an intended audience and an intended effect. The small differences between the two perspectives offered by Hough and Eisenstein is significant and colors what the audience thinks of the mutiny and how they identify with it\".\n\t In term of length we see a long shot mixing with short cuts. The duration for each cut in very short if needed and very long if needed. A strong use of the graphic match in the baby's scene. In his intellectual we can feel the strong relationships between the shots. In his film, Eisenstein, we can see the achievements of the mise-en-sc\u00e8n a few shots to deliver moments of people while they facing hard time with the dictatorial government authorities. Many of medium shots in the film, but the Odessa Steps clip, he almost never uses a long shots. He uses this technique to be more tough on the audience in the cinema, in order to let them sympathize with the victims of the movie. Many great outstanding tracking shots, were in a time there are no steadicam on set. As great way to balance the mise-en-sc\u00e8n, he puts his camera on his DOP's shoulder many times to makes steps sequences more realistic and touching . In term of light Eisenstein uses the sunlight, among with street light. Some time he shows the camera from the police guys perspective, and many time he shows the shot from his people perspective, this is a smart way to manipulate the viewers . As other Soviets, Eisenstein, has never do a slow and boring cuts in his montag, as US filmmakers did. The establishing shot for the steps sequences are absolutely breaking the 180-degree rule, Eisenstein wants us to understand we are watching a film during his opening sequences! With no  sound effects and dialogue, in this scene, Eisenstein successfully makes strong images with his montage, as Anna Chen says in her journal that \"Although Eisenstein is widely credited as the 'father of montage' - a form of editing technique - he wasn't strictly the first director to cut film in order to construct scenes. Early filmmakers such as George M\u00e9li\u00e8s and the Lumi\u00e8re brothers had lifted existing theatrical methods for the screen wholesale, with little or no adaptation to the new medium. A stationary camera, the equivalent of a static audience, was placed at a fixed distance from the actors, where it passively recorded the basic mise-en-sc\u00e8n\".\n\tIs this the film carries an agenda? Is this the film is made in order to achieve a political goals ? Was the film carries propaganda? It is clear to say that it is a naive to see this film as just made for that. This film devices many methods for the film industry to make greatest and better movies.\"\"we can see the seeds for the films of Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Quentin Tarantino, and others. Filmed in beautiful black and white, its scenes of uprising are rousing and incredible. The Odessa staircase scene, where the baby carriage with baby in tow glides slowly down the stairs, is one of the most famous film sequences and rightly so. Battleship Potemkin is a superior film and during its editing process, Sergei Eisenstein must have surely invented some new techniques that would inspire generations of filmmakers to come.\"(filmreviewsnsuch).\" This film and the Odessa Steps clip opens many doors for the creativity and innovation in the montage. The creation of many important filmmakers around the world for the use of montage in an unusual manner. Eisenstein's masterpiece has lots of influences to French wave, Italian realism, and American New Wave. A lot of creative filmmakers around the world consider it as one of the most important film in the history of cinema.",

As a propaganda film it exceeds expectations, presenting a story that's deeply emotional even for a foreign audience. There is no question that Battleship Potemkin should be seen by every film student, but is it as mandatory for a more casual viewer?\n\tLet's face it; Battleship Potemkin is a propaganda film. It portrays the government as rats and does nothing to redeem them. However, this is no worse then the way The Empire is portrayed in Star Wars or Loki in The Avengers. There are no real characters to attach to, because this movie isn't about characters. It's about a general population and their struggle to have rights and that story is done incredibly well, both for a 1925 film and even for a film today. The story evolves and evolves taking you places you wouldn't expect, and this makes the film actually a unique watch. For how old this movie is, its story isn't that clich\u00e9 and it's really quite refreshing.\n\tThe solid story wouldn't be nearly as strong if Sergei Eisenstein hadn't been able to encapsulate the emotion like he did through editing and cinematography. The staircase scene, the fight on the battleship, and the ending scene are all monumentally tense and effective. The staircase sequence alone is shocking enough, especially if you go in with 1920s expectations. Going from a more basic movie like a Chaplin or Keaton work to this will make the film all the more effective. While those movies work just fine, Battleship Potemkin exceeds all expectations and destroys all comfort you may have. The violence used and the shocking portrayal of humanity being destroyed is something that wouldn't be done today, let alone back then.\n\tWhere this film does fail is the uneven pacing. There are plenty of points in-between the more dramatic scenes where the movie just hits a brick wall. People are just standing around talking, or they're just doing... stuff. Getting ready for war or protesting bad meat, all at a slow pace and with nothing particularly interesting to look at. The soundtrack helps a little as it's generally very dramatic and nice to listen to, but that doesn't completely rid you of the creeping sense of... boredom. \nIf you can make it through the movie, and odds are you will, there will be no doubt that what you watched was totally worth every moment and that you won't forget it any time soon. Battleship Potemkin is a masterpiece of a movie. Not without the typical pacing problems of the time, it's still a great watch and in my opinion something that even a more casual viewer can enjoy.\ngo to mentalmultiverse.wordpress.com for more reviews",

The movie is simple in story, but rich in cultural history. We begin on the Potemkin, in which the sailor revolt due to poor conditions, such as their food; rotten with maggots. \r\n\r\nAfter the brave Bolshevik Vakulinchuk dies after the soldiers take over the battleship, his body then becomes a symbol of public outcry. This then leads to the infamous staircase scene, where Tsarist soldiers massacre the citizens of Odessa. \r\nThe movie uses the technique of montage, relatively new at the time. The use of it in the movie is brilliant, helping give off the emotions the film is trying to portrait. If I were to nitpick, I would say the characters of the film are too simple and not fleshed out enough and are treated more like symbols, but this movie, in reality, is a propaganda film, and the characterization were intentional. \r\n\r\nThe editing is quick and skilled, giving a heart-pounding experience in a relatively short film (the Kino restoration is about 70 minutes long). If one were to view a film in which its editing could impact the masses, this would be the movie to see. It is noted that the Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels said that the film was, \"a marvelous film without equal in the cinema ... anyone who had no firm political conviction could become a Bolshevik after seeing the film.\" This showcases the amazing power the film has to have you root to the cause it presents. \r\n\r\n**** out of ****",

I think I came into it with the wrong attitude; when I watched this movie a long time ago, I had only ever seen one other silent movie, Nosferatu. Nosferatu was, for the most part, fairly traditional, and it didn't deviate from today's filmgoing expectations of narrative. Now having seen at least fifty silent films, I have a much better understanding of what this fragile era in movie history represented. This was truly the time of auteurs, a time to strike out and make a name for yourself however you could (or, in the case of Eisenstein, however you were commisioned to). Battleship Potemkin is less a narrative movie than several linked short films about an event in Russian history, and to look at it this way completely changes my perspective. These cinematic poems are stunningly beautiful and invigorating, and Potemkin may be one of the defining works of film art. On an unrelated note, Potemkin, for the first time ever, didn't make the top ten in Sight and Sound's poll. Perhaps it's because hacks like me are finally beginning to understand it, so they figured they needed a new gimmick.",

This is so much a part of the language of film now that it is expected that the audience understand this vocabulary - Eisenstein was one of the most influential teachers of this filmic grammar.\r\n\r\nThe film itself, the second in an uncompleted series, \"The Year 1905\" (following \"Strike\"), contains powerful sequences and effectively uses the masses of people available to him in creating profound images but has less story momentum that \"Strike\" and less consistently masterful scene composition. It seems that \"Strike\", in many ways the better film, has been overshadowed by \"Potemkin\" because of a few influential scenes.\r\n\r\nSeen with modern eyes much of the movie is a bit clunky and heavy with propaganda (it may have even seemed heavy with propaganda then) but it had tremendous influence on the way films were made, contributed a great deal to the vocabulary of cinema, and there are segments which are affecting and still stirringly effective nearly a century later.

Against the imperial regime, the high society and the church.\r\n\r\nIt's influential, costumes, sets and the ships look quite nice and authentic and the cinematography and the editing is revolutionary (pun intented) but for a more or less casual viewer it's not very interesting - that doesn't mean it's a bad film but not one of the best.\r\n\r\nPS: The staircase scene is great indeed.\r\n\r\nPPS: The film shows why films usually have protagonists - not having one is a bit odd for today's standards.",

            "content": "When assessing any classic film, one has a duty to point out any flaws or shortcomings even while accepting whatever historical significance the film holds. While it's pointless to criticise an old film without knowledge of its artistic, social and technological context (in other words, what could and couldn't be done at the time), it's every bit as asinine to go all rose-tinted and claim that someone has great worth purely because of its age.\r\n\r\nWe might admire silent films as a genre, but that does not mean that every silent film is up to the standard of The General. We might acknowledge the contribution that The Birth of a Nation made to the art of editing, but that does not excuse its inherent racism. Likewise, it is possible to admire Battleship Potemkin for its advances in the art of montage and for its spectacular set-pieces. But admiration of either aspect is not enough to excuse its overwrought tone, poor storytelling and its abject failure as a piece of propaganda.\r\n\r\nBattleship Potemkin could be called the high point of Sergei Eisenstein's first career. Prior to falling out with Joseph Stalin in the late-1920s, the eccentric Soviet filmmaker had won the favour of the Communist Party with his first feature Strike, an episodic recreation of a 1903 strike at a Russian factory. As part of his theory of montage, Eisenstein intercut scenes of factory workers being suppressed with footage of cattle being slaughtered, using unrelated images to generate an emotional response. The film impressed Stalin and Eisenstein was commissioned by the Party to make Battleship Potemkin as a follow-up.\r\n\r\nBoth Strike and Battleship Potemkin use a past event in pre-Soviet Russia to illuminate the class struggle of the present. Bolshevism, and the Marxism upon which it was based, rested on the principle that history is based upon struggles between the workers and the bourgeoisie, with the former eventually leading a revolution to overthrow the latter and create a society based upon equality and communal ownership (a rank generalisation, but for these purposes it will suffice). By invoking examples of revolts or struggles which occurred before the Bolsheviks swept to power, Eisenstein would instil in people the idea that they were part of a greater struggle, and that liberty was now within their grasp.\r\n\r\nThere is no denying that Battleship Potemkin deserves credit and admiration on a technical level. While the age and variable quality of surviving prints makes it difficult to judge Eisenstein's visuals, the use of montage has never been replicated to quite the same effect in any other film. We tend to think of montage as an editing technique to denote the passage of time - cutting together scenes of, say, a couple together in various poses or locations to show how long they have been together.\r\n\r\nEisenstein's montage, on the other hand, is driven by emotional response: shots of people are intercut in such a way as to provoke a reaction from the crowd. One example of this comes early on, when the crew are arguing about being served maggot-ridden meat. Eisenstein intercuts gruesome shots of the meat with the sailors' faces, to reinforce their degraded state. While the direct practice of Russian montage has been virtually non-existent since the 1950s, Eisenstein's work represents a huge step forward in the language of editing: his use of cutting to convey emotion is as radical as D. W. Griffith's use of panning shots to show battles on a huge scale in The Birth of a Nation.\r\n\r\nThere are also several moments in Battleship Potemkin which are exciting, or at least impressive. The Odessa Steps sequence, depicting a bloody but completely fictitious massacre, has entered the canon of all-time great scenes, and remains without question the best part of the film. The shot of the pram running down the eponymous steps was famously parodied in The Untouchables, which was itself parodied in the third Naked Gun film seven years later. But the scene is also memorable for its shocking moments, from the sight of a young boy being shot to the silent scream of a woman with shattered spectacles, an image which Francis Bacon used as the basis for several of his paintings.\r\n\r\nSo far, then, Battleship Potemkin would seem to be as much of a classic as it has been revered to be. But once we get beyond admiring its technical achievements, or experiencing brief shock at the violent moments, or gaining some small understanding of the context in which it was made, what we are left with is a lot more underwhelming and poorly constructed than its reputation would lead us to believe. Its flaws are not enough to completely turn our hearts, but all the admiration in the world can't make up for them.\r\n\r\nFor starters, the film is thinly written and poorly paced. Silent films relied primarily on physical expression to tell their stories and flesh out characters, since having actors mouth long speeches intercut with lengthy inter-titles would not be dramatically engaging. By using exaggerated movement and meticulous facial expression, the likes of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin were able to convey in a second what the talkies would need a whole minute to say. This gave silent films an in-built modesty and efficiency, so that when they did run longer than an hour (or two, as Metropolis did), they usually earned the right to do so.\r\n\r\nEven at 74 minutes, Battleship Potemkin is about three times longer than it needs to be to serve such a simple story. Eisenstein's use of montage may generate a certain amount of emotion, but it has the side effect of dragging out the action long after the point has been made, and made, and made again. Compared to later propaganda works like Triumph of the Will, the point the film makes about class unity and power is insultingly simple, even to an audience who were potentially illiterate and therefore couldn't read inter-titles.\r\n\r\nWhile Eisenstein may have the subtlety of a hammer, he lacks the sharp edge of a sickle. There's no point trying to assess Battleship Potemkin in terms of characters, because the point of Soviet propaganda was to instil collective identity and prioritise class unity over the satisfaction of individual wants and needs. Complaining that there is no discernible protagonist, or that the only charismatic character is killed off after 20 minutes, is nothing more than a reflection of our own film discourse; we expect things to be a certain way because we have been taught that that is the only way.\r\n\r\nEven if we accept this, however, the film is massively overwrought and narratively fanciful. Because this is a propaganda film, it's a waste of time trying to separate fact from fiction, because everything has been dressed up both in the language of Eisenstein's editing and the political views it takes. But even with that level of acceptance, it is frankly ridiculous to believe that the whole fleet would refuse to fire on the Potemkin having been impressed by their bravery. Not only is it a huge anti-climax, it's so out of the blue and illogical that it threatens to undo whatever hard work Eisenstein had done up to that point.\r\n\r\nWorst of all, Battleship Potemkin fails because it does not cut the mustard as propaganda: it does not do what is says on the tin. Just as all good comedies should make you laugh, and all good horror movies should scare you, so a properly made propaganda film should draw you into the story or ideas so that you are convinced by them, even if only for the moment when the film is playing.\r\n\r\nPropaganda films are the exception to the rule that you cannot judge a film by its box office. Triumph of the Will worked because it appealed to ordinary men and women, many of whom didn't vote for the Nazis in the first place: it was a hit because, to quote Leni Riefenstahl, it \"impressed an audience which was not necessarily interested in politics\". Battleship Potemkin, which had all the distribution you could ask for, failed to become a popular hit. This is not because punters in the 1920s were stupid: it is because the film preaches to the converted.  The Party's message had become so saturated in popular art and culture that there was no need for anyone in the Soviet Union to see it.\r\n\r\nTime has not been kind to Battleship Potemkin. Certainly the decision of the Brussels World's Fair to name it the greatest film ever in 1958 looks every bit as foolish as the Academy's decision to give the Best Film Oscar to How Green Was My Valley over Citizen Kane. Its innovations in editing and structure still stand, and as an historical artefact it retains some degree of importance. But otherwise there is precious little to celebrate about it, falling short on an emotional level of both Griffith and Riefenstahl.",

It's not the most fun to watch, especially given how differently its narrative works from what we are used to seeing, but there's no denying its creativity and importance in film history.\n\nThe film, which was commissioned by Soviet authorities to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the events which it depicts, is a re-enactment of the 1905 mutiny on the battleship Potemkin and the short-lived proletariat uprising it inspired. Contrary to the expectations we have of movies these days, the film has no central protagonist or, indeed, any well-developed characters at all. The focus is always on the groups of people, and so the contemporary viewer has no individual characters to identify with or invest it. This fits the purpose with which the film was made, but does make it seem a remote curiosity to us today.\n\nThe most famous part of the movie is the \"Odessa Steps\" sequence, in which a whole bunch of peasants get ruthlessly massacred by an anonymous line of czarist troops. It is indeed still an effective sequence, and the image of that stroller careening down the steps is still pretty scary. It's been referenced and parodied a bunch, and I think even Tarantino may have been at least subconsciously thinking of it for the climax of Inglourious Basterds, although in that movie our sympathies are with the people doing the massacring. \n\nThe film's director, Sergei Eisenstein, like many people who thought about film in his day, had a narrow and dogmatic conception of cinema. He thought there was only important film technique, juxtaposition through associative montage editing, and only one purpose to that technique, to stir revolutionary fervor among the masses. Obviously, film can and should do all sorts of things Eisenstein wouldn't have done with it, but I have to hand it to the commie bastard, he was good at that one thing (montage) he chose to focus on. He's like a guy who thinks you should only eat steak for each and every meal, but who does admittedly make a good steak. Eisenstein's use of montage, and the increasingly furious rhythm with which he cuts back and forth between different images, is still striking 86 years later. Even though the overall narrative of the film leaves a lot to be desired, the moments where it shines are undeniably well put-together. Watching it today is basically film-history homework, but it's an important homework assignment.",

So without further ado, I give you my ado to this excellent silent film; Battleship Potemkin.\r\n\r\nPlot: This is set in 1905 where a Russian crew od the battleship Potemkin create a mutiny against their officers and start to for a rebellion against the Tsarist regime. \r\n\r\nThis as clever but brutal film. The messed up thing to me was the stairs scene. no one was safe, not the little boy, not the mother or even her precious baby in that carriage. But what's messed up to me is that it didn't even actually happen during this particular event. It apparently was more something to put in the film to give an idea about that particular time. In fact, this film has been re edited by the government a few times to get rid of some of the more brutal moments. \r\n\r\nNormally I'd give you a section that list the main actors but there isn't really any in this film. In a sense, the crew is all one in fighting against their enemies. There are some named here and their but nothing to me that was exactly the most important character in the film aside from the character Grigory Vakulinchuk's brief part in the film. That aside, I'll just say that the acting was very well done and everyone did an excellent job with showing us these suspenseful or brutal events.\r\n   \r\n\r\nChoreography/Editing: They've done and excellent job with the choreography and editing. This film was very well shot and I liked what they really did with the editing. most of what they did in something suspenseful was repeatedly showing several things in some very quick cuts to build the suspense and acknowledge every single detail that happens. especially at the very end where the music slowly but surly gets louder and louder as it focuses on the ship and the squadron, the cannons aiming, the engines going like crazy and so on. It's a very good film to show to give the idea of giving suspense by making a lot of quick cuts.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd that is my review for Battleship Potemkin. next class we'll be watching The General, and I look forward to what I may learn there.",

Some historians have pointed to the \"bread marches\" of Russian mothers and wives in the winter of 1917 as the tipping point of the communist revolution in that country. They were loosely following the example set by a group of disgruntled, demoralized, and underfed sailors fighting in Tsar Nicolas II's ill-fated 1905 war against Japan. \"Battleship Potemkin,\" a classic silent film directed by the great Sergei Eisenstein, dramatizes this struggle at sea and the subsequent fervor in the port city of Odessa. These protests are unabashed displays of patriotism and, ultimately, sacrifice. Despite its rousing ending, Eisenstein feeds no illusions about the long road that lies ahead for discontented.\n\nAmazingly, I think \"Potemkin\" is my first encounter with a full feature-length silent film; it has been recently restored by a German film museum. But it is definitely not my first political thriller, and I can say that it is easily better than most modern ones. \n\n\"Potemkin\" is almost constant motion. The natives grow restless due to worm-ridden meat rations and the commander tries to make an example of the anyone who dares to point out the harm in this. What occurs throughout the rest of the film is finely choreographed chaos that carries a convincing sense of constant peril. It's not too much of a stretch to say the film nothing but one long, exhausting perilous precipice of a story: hundreds of actors pack the frame under a looming gun turret, heads pop out of portholes and brandish rifles, men are hurled from railings and into the deep. There are far more symbols than characters. Eisenstein aims to create agitprop that identifies the enemies of the people - clergy, aristocracy, anti-Semites - rather than nuanced drama that examines where they all come from.\n\nEisenstein's true extremism lies not in his politics but in his technical chops. The famous bravura sequence depicting a massacre of protesters in solidarity with the red mutineers still mesmerizes. Its influence is positively egalitarian,  inspiring operatic greatness and blockbuster hackdom in equal measure.  Onscreen space shrinks rapidly, suggesting the Tsar's power to immobilize and confine his subjects is vast and successful in making every rejoinder for the rights of the people into a literal uphill battle. This one, though, is not nearly as pitched as the others in the film. It is fought by citizens, not soldiers, and quickly tumbles out of sight at the point of a gun. Therein is \"Potemkin\" - a war film that is about nothing but the war outside our own homes.",

            "content": "4 Stars out of 4\r\n\r\nSergei Eisenstein's The Battleship Potemkin hurdles past cinema into the heart of history itself. It manipulates montage to a tee and also manipulates our sympathy to the point that the film is a transgressive angle to historical analysis. Never have I seen a film that made me want to root, cry, squirm, and then applaud. Eisenstein's film is labeled, in a simple sense, as propaganda. It gives the film a harsh label, and not one it deserves, because it evokes feelings that, despite Eisenstein's conceited ways, never feel synthetic.\r\n\r\nThe film released 8 years after the beginning of the Bolshevik Revolution, where Communist took on an age of its own. Russian socialists began to rebel against the elitist tsarists and violence, pain, and civil animosity was overwhelming. As a silent film, The Battleship Potemkin works best. In all the quiet, the film is juxtaposed by a visual that moves vigorously. In the silence, the mayhem surrounding evokes repression and the emotional strife of sympathizing with our inferior heroes.\r\n\r\nWell, the point is these heroes are no longer tolerating their subjugation. What began as a quarrel over food rations snowballs into a grand-scaled uprising on the ship - you guessed it -\u00a0the Potemkin. The ship holds a triumphant stance; it travels along the waters at ease and aggressive power. The sailors move throughout in coordinates but feel disjointed from each other and discontent with their duties. \r\n\r\nSoon, all hell breaks loose. They rise up and Eisenstein emphasizes courage over disruption. The narration, written by Eisenstein, is expressed mostly in dialogical passages that evoke urgency. The music, orchestrated (from the version I saw) was by the Club Foot Orchestra who nail the daringly ostentatious epic soundtrack. \r\n\r\nThe Battleship Potemkin is divided into episodes, which give the audience an obvious direction towards the emotional impact. Emotion, in this film, is delivered through set pieces, that's power is assured through the film's brutal courage. During the famous Odessa Staircase sequence, the Tsar's Cossacks march in a mechanical and highly foreboding manner towards a crowd of rioting civilians. They fire at the people, as the bullets tare through the crowd and into our emotions. After we are perturbed by Eisenstein's startling sequence, a baby carriage tumbles down the stairwell as the Cossacks fire frantically. Eisenstein power is pure: no one was afraid to shoot the baby -\u00a0which symbolically, and fairly so, refers to the neglected, fragile, yet very healthy Bolsheviks.\r\n\r\nEisenstein is said to have made the film based on the Kuleshov school of filmmaking, which emphasized splicing images together to create the most emotional resonance. The film's weight even affected ruthless Nazism and figures of that political position who became fascinated by the film's ability to epitomize the pleasure of revolt and chaos. The Battleship Potemkin is a turning force against authority but it also believes in authority in another sense -\u00a0the coerciveness of the mutineers. \r\n\r\nJoseph Stalin would ban the film during his reign when the Comintern ceased to promote world revolution and mutiny among the navies of capitalist countries. It was eventually repudiated by Nazi Germany and tagged 'X Rated' until 1978. Despite its contention, the film is appreciated, homaged, and transcended in contemporary cinema. De Palma revitalized the Odessa Staircase sequence in The Untouchables -\u00a0great film. Even George Lucas reflected the episodic sense of chaos in Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith. \r\n\r\nSo where does this leave the film? A masterwork, slow at times (as I find most silent films) but it conveys itself in a way that a silent film only could: restrained, elegant, yet relentlessly exuberant. It should be watched by all film and even history students because it manipulates the true effects of cinema, while balancing the subjective vulnerability of history. When that woman bled from her right eye, Eisenstein presented something uncanny, disturbing, and unknowable. We never could understand the agony of those neglected. Eisenstein tells us why we always root for the underdog in cinema.",

Comparing it to other pictures from the era is fairly laughable.  Nobody was editing like this.  I would go so far as to say that the editing is much closer to the style of the French Nouvelle Vague or contemporary cinema than it is to any cinema from the 10's, 20's, 30's, or 40's.  The juxtaposition of unrelated images in order to maximize empathy and emotional impact was pure genius.  It seems incredible that what was designed to be a simple propaganda film to commemorate the rebellion on a Tsarist vessel in 1905, which subsequently spreads to the port city of Odessa, turned to be a lasting work of art and influence.  However, it certainly isn't the only film of its kind.  Goebbels and the German's enjoyed it so much it undoubtedly influenced their sponsorship of Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will and Olympia, both masterpieces of propaganda in their own right.  Eisenstein's work broke down some of the barriers relating to the use of images in the cinema, even if film everywhere took a big step backward with the advent of sound.  The scene on the Odessa steps is remarkable, as is the gradual build up to the potential naval battle in the end.  It actually reminded me of the end of Last of the Mohicans, which I recently watched, especially with the pounding and repetitious score on the Blu-Ray version.  The picture looks rather remarkable considering it was made in the Soviet Union around 1925.  I couldn't help but feel that Eisenstein wasn't fully invested in the subject matter though.  There were numerous instances where I could imagine him making a much stronger case for rebellion.  Perhaps he didn't feel he needed to justify the rebellion, given his audience, but it seemed like a fairly halfhearted endorsement to me.  The picture definitely provides a unique and interesting view into the collective culture and mind of Russia.",

After seeing \"Triumph of the Will,\" I had thought I had seen the masterwork in the genre of propaganda films, but this treasure is beyond what is commonly referred to as propaganda. Taken from a true account of a ship mutiny in 1905, Sergei Eisenstein changed the way films were made, especially because he was one of the first to use montages. These five sequences, spliced together to create a narrative about the Bolshevik Revolution to come, made for emotional turmoil on the part of the viewer. Yes, there are some overtly political elements and definitely enraging sequences, but this film does not shrink from reality. The story goes that these shipmates were being fed rotten meat infested with maggots, that citizens are murdered, bloody in the streets, and that these men, fueled by the good tide of Communism, rose to the challenge of overthrowing their oppressors. It's definitely a film that leans to the goodwill of the Russian government, but there is also some shocking imagery and poetic visuals that will astound you. It's simply awe inspiring how some of the more violent and cruel deaths of these citizens are actually shown even though the times were ridden with censorship. An old woman is shot through the eye, and her blood runs down her chin while her glasses sit broken on her face! The visual alone will haunt your dreams, but that's not the worst death to accompany this film. There's also truth to this violence, and so it becomes even stranger to watch the film, knowing it's more than a propaganda film, but one made to encroach sympathy and anger for the ills of old. Breathtaking for its simplicity and yet irrevocably strong, it definitely stands the test of time.",

The opening act on the title ship are somewhat static and pedestrian, but it is when the body of the dead sailor Vakulinchuk is deposited on the docks of Odessa, spurring a huge procession of oppressed Russians, that the film kicks into high gear - the montage of images combining close-ups of grieving workers interspersed with the quick-cut editing of clenched fists and angry eyes gives the film an astonishing amount of coiled energy which is finally unleashed in the famous Odessa Steps sequence, with the strident motif of faceless boots and rifles marching downwards toward the panicked chaos of the crushed mob - and of course, the terrifying and iconic sight of an out-of-control baby carriage. Unfortunately, the third act can't keep up the same amount of tension - Eisenstein seems constrained by the limitations of filming at sea.

Among such influences are the use of dissolves to give the illusion of images fading into frame as if ghosts, and the use of rapid montage which has become a staple for action sequences ever since. The most unforgettable application of this method is in the brutal massacre scene, shot on the steps of Odessa where it actually occurred in 1905. But the photography and editing are only one reason to watch this film, for it is also a stirring story of social upheaval. Director Sergei Eisenstein initially intended to tell a revolution story with larger scope, but instead, wisely chose to focus on a single event and then extrapolate to a bigger picture using symbolic images, such as worms crawling on dead meat representing the belittled masses, a pair of glasses ingeniously representing the blindness of the government, and three quick shots of three stone lions that represents the waking of an angry people who won't stay quiet anymore.",

I was drawn into this film more than Strike, but they both jar me profoundly, in a negative way. I enjoy the cinematography greatly: Eisenstein has a great eye for powerful shots that stir emotion. But the plot here again feels messy and scatter-shot. The people of Odessa decide to assist the Potemkin's crew in fighting for a better country, but then they are mercilessly slaughtered while the Potemkin looks on...not a very helpful crew! This film, more than the first, smelt like propaganda, and maybe that's why it is so wildly adored, for the influence it had in Russia and abroad. I suppose this would feel like a grander film if I didn't already know how the Communist movement would be nearly as bad as Tsarist Russia.

Excellent film editing, cinematography, production, and so on.\n\nIt is a story of revolution, in which heroes and freedom fighters began to stand up to tyranny and autocracy, even if they have to be dead to get rid of them. It started with a violent mutiny on the battleship where crewmen had had enough of the mistreatment of their superiors. Because of the death of one, people cry out for justice. The most memorable scene in the Odessa staircase underlined the film's dramatic intentions. However, it is not my favourite. I liked more the scene where the camera shots from an elevation the exodus and lining up of people while descending the steps. The transition from empty to crowded steps is ground-breaking.\n\nThis would be one of the films that you won't get tired of watching again and again, analyzing, and connecting with its message.

He introduced the use of montage and revolutionised the way films were made during the time period, technically and visually. Full of searing images and real emotion, Battleship Potemkin builds tension and fear expertly, leading to the famous and iconic final scenes at the Odessa steps.
