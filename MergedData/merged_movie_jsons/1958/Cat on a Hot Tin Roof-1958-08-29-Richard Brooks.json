            "content": "This is a fantastic look into a dysfunctional American family, 1950's Style. I was prepared to hate this movie, as I typically don't get into dramas at all. Fortunately, I was completely drawn in. Paul Newman's character (Brick) is enigmatic at best, but somehow, because Maggie the Cat loves him so much and is so utterly devoted to him, you find yourself caring about what happens to him and Maggie both.Big Daddy and Big Mama both bring back fond memories of my own childhood, and if you grew up in the south, chances are you knew someone like the both of them. Their characters are written and performed so typically Southern, that I realized half way through I felt family connections with the whole family, including the no-neck monsters! Sister Girl is the sister in law from Hades, and her husband needs to dig into her purse for his...manhood. We ALL know a couple like that! All in all? Elizabeth Taylor, Paul Newman, and Burl Ives are breathtakingly beautiful in their portrayals. This is probably not a good family movie, as Brick has a serious drinking problem and Maggie IS so desperate for his affections, and probably not a good Friday/Saturday night movie, but I still love it, and will think of it fondly for the rest of my life.It rates an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",

            "content": "\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" is truly an actor's movie, and it is one of those rare films where every single actor is perfect.  Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor are both brilliant as Brick and Maggie Pollitt, respectively.  Not very often is there a screen couple that have the same chemistry together that they do.Newman, however, steals the show.  If you watch \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" for nothing else, watch it for his performance.  One of the greatest actors of all time, Newman showcases how powerful an actor he can be.  This is not to say the supporting cast isn't excellent.  Burl Ives is superb in a supporting role as Big Daddy, a man who's greatest concern is having his legacy live on after him.  The sequence with Ives and Newman in the basement of the house remains one of the most incredible displays of acting I have ever seen.\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" is a very appropriate title.  It is a searing, wonderfully acted film that I will not soon forget.  I recommend those who haven't seen it yet to rent it as soon as they get a chance.  A true classic.",

            "review_title": "A powerful Burl Ives livens up a simple story",
            "content": "The best thing Cat on a Hot Tin Roof has going for it is one truly remarkable acting performance. And that performance comes from neither Elizabeth Taylor nor Paul Newman. There's nothing wrong with the work turned in by Taylor and Newman, they are both perfectly fine in their roles. And it is their characters who are the focus for most of the film. But late on in the proceedings Burl Ives grabs hold of the film and makes it his own. Ives turns in a performance which is so strong and powerful that it threatens to overshadow and overwhelm everything else in the film. However it is rather difficult to overshadow Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman. And the film's rather simple story is certainly compelling enough so as not to be overwhelmed by the Ives tour de force near the end. So while Ives may end up being the most memorable thing the film has to offer he is certainly not the only memorable thing. His great performance is merely the best part of what is an overall thoroughly satisfying film.The film's simple story centers around a day in the life of a wealthy Southern family. With this family the key word is \"mendacity\". What does that even mean? Any of our characters who initially don't know about mendacity surely will by the time the story plays itself out. As we meet them everyone has come together to celebrate the 65th birthday of family patriarch Big Daddy. Initially it seems the film is about Big Daddy's son Brick and his wife Maggie the Cat. Brick and Maggie are not currently in the throes of wedded bliss. To say their relationship is strained would be putting it mildly. The fact that alcohol seems to be the only thing in life Brick is at all interested in probably does not help matters. But as the film progresses we see there is a larger issue than Brick and Maggie's troubled marriage. Big Daddy is dying. And nobody, not his family and not his doctors, has the guts to tell him. This will ultimately play itself out in powerful, heartrending fashion.For much of the film's running time you would call it compelling but certainly not spectacular. But then Ives, as Big Daddy, grabs the film by its throat and shakes some real life into it. There's a scene where Ives as Big Daddy and Newman as Brick are alone in a basement which simply could not have been performed any better. There's so much these characters have to say to one another. The emotion is raw and the scene is so powerful. It hits you right in the heart. Just this one scene alone, with these two great actors, elevates the film all by itself. Newman is terrific. Ives is astounding. Perhaps it is in fact possible to overshadow Elizabeth Taylor. Maybe just this once. Maggie the Cat is an intriguing character in her own right and Taylor certainly doesn't disappoint in the role. But it turns out that ultimately the film is really about the relationship between Brick and his father, not Brick and his wife. And as such it is Newman, and most especially Ives, who you will most remember. It is their work which transforms a good movie into something truly memorable.",

            "review_title": "Wonderful Williams - Brilliant Ives",
            "content": "Burl Ives gives the greatest portrayal of a literary character in film history, and he wasn't even recognized by an Oscar nomination, further evidence of the Academy's complete lack of credibility as an arbiter of screen excellence.The casting is brilliant:Tennessee Williams's Big Daddy was indeed big - larger than life, domineering, insensitive, self-absorbed. Burl Ives's Big Daddy is larger than life, insensitive, domineering, self-absorbed. Ives is \"on\" every moment. And every moment is true.Paul Newman's Brick, is as afraid of life as Big Daddy is in love with it. Yet, in his way, he's a chip off the old block - self-absorbed, insensitive.And domineering or, as Big Daddy and Maggie would have it, masterful, ready to take charge -if he could just get over himself.I confess, I don't care for Elizabeth Taylor as an actress, but she is so right for the part, that I can't think of anyone else to fill it. Anyway, who else has eyes that could compete with Newman's? Judith Anderson plays the typical Williams matron, living in her house of delusions. She's Big Daddy's tormented, desperately lonely, unloved partner, who towards the end wins Big Daddy with her nobility and devotion.The under-appreciated Jack Carter has the unenviable role of Brick's pliant, conformist brother, Gooper, decent at heart but worn out after years of jumping through Big Daddy's hoops and still winding up on the short end, with a house full of brats, bred at Big Daddy's presumed bidding and delivered by a scheming, ambitious weasel of a wife. Gooper the only character I have a little trouble with, because his climactic speech, as rendered by Carter, is so heartfelt, that we are aggrieved with him at the injustice of Big Daddy's favoritism for the no-account but aesthetically more pleasing Brick.Perhaps an even more unenviable role is that of Gooper's wife, played to perfection by Madeleine Sherwood. Anyone who has grown up in the South has known \"Sister Woman\". I can assure those who haven't, that this character is not a stereotype or caricature.There are a few quibbles. One character, the family doctor, though played well by Larry Gates, has a dramatic function that's about as useful as the referee in a pro wrestling match, but not nearly as decorative. I guess he's included to provide plot information, but I think it could have been provided just as well without him. I was also put off by the contrived thunder claps at dramatic moments. Then, there were some continuity problems, such as different facial expression when shot angles were changed and Gooper's too many \"Shut ups\" to Sister Woman.If, as another reviewer has said, Tennessee Williams hated this film, then it couldn't have been because it was untrue to his work. If he disliked the changes and omissions, he should blame '50s prudishness, not the film, for dictating, say, the suppression of Brick's homosexuality. Williams wrote about lies and delusions, the good ones and bad ones. Well, that's what Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and Streetcar Named Desire and Glass Menagerie were all about. Tennessee Williams's stories about the South and its culture of delusion are not just rebukes of Southern hypocrisy and bloodymindedness but paeans to the gentle and genteel refuge which delusion provides. As Maggie \"The Cat\" says, \"Truth, truth - everybody keeps hollerin' about the truth. Well, the truth is as dirty as lies.\"Finally, I think it was brilliant of Richard Brooks to insist on color, for Williams's stuff is talky, and with the drabness of a typical Williams set, this can be a bit oppressive. With color, and the wonderful animation Brooks instills in all the characters, his Cat contains not a dull moment. If Brooks has given us something at odds with what Williams intended, I think he has given us something just as fine.",

            "content": "In \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,\" Newman is an ex-football player, trying to relive his college athletic glories\u0085 Drinking and staggering, he attempts to jump hurdles, resulting in a painful injury that has him hobbling around on crutches during most of the film\u0085 The role was certainly another demonstration of his widening range, for Brick is in many ways the antithesis of Ben Quick (\"The Long, Hot Summer\"). Although he too is cynical, cold and guilt-ridden, he manifests it by becoming moody, withdrawn, introverted\u0085 In addition, whereas Ben was strong and decisive, causing and participating in events, Brick is weak and passive, largely reacting to events around him... And he's anything but ambitious: while his greedy brother and sister-in-law await Big Daddy's death so they can inherit his huge fortune and plantation, and while his wife Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) urges him to fight for his share, he merely broods and drinks... An emotionally crippled, \"thirty-year-old boy,\" he refuses to face responsibility and truth, preferring to drown his memories in liquor\u0085Newman and Taylor enact striking contrasts in temperament: she is fiery, loud, animated, sensual; he is cold, quiet, immobile, dispassionate\u0085 Brick and Maggie haven't been sleeping together, and she wants him desperately, but he keeps rejecting her advances\u0085 As she talks, he replies with sarcasm, contempt and mostly indifference, speaking in a dreamy, monotonous manner, as if only half-there\u0085 In conversations with her, as with Big Daddy (Burl Ives), he stares into space, or walks away (usually toward the liquor supply), turning his back on the other party and forcing the dialog to take place on separate planes\u0085 All of this places him in a private world, where he hides his torment and anxiety beneath a mask of detachment\u0085If Newman is best at enacting Brick's unspoken thoughts and emotions, he's also effective in the more spirited moments, as when he screams at Maggie or Big Daddy, to prevent them from getting at the truth he wants kept buried\u0085 But exactly what the \"truth\" is remains unclear\u0085 In the play, Brick's fear of admitting a homosexual attachment led indirectly to his friend's death and explained his overall moodiness and passivity\u0085 But because of Hollywood's moral code, director-scriptwriter Richard Brooks had to eliminate this, and the character's motivations are considerably weakened\u0085 His hostility toward Maggie\u0097understandable in the play\u0097is especially confusing because it results from events that are unconvincingly outlined\u0085With the homosexuality cut out, Brick's dependence upon his friend is now explained by the failure of Big Daddy to provide strength and love, and this changed emphasis does make for exciting drama\u0085 The film's key scene\u0097not in the play\u0097is one in which Brick confronts his father with this painful truth\u0085 As they sit in a cellar disarranged with the old man's useless antiques, he tells Big Daddy that love cannot be bought\u0085 Newman moves powerfully from anguished looks to an eruption of emotion, smashing everything in sight, finally breaking down and crying: \"All I wanted was a father, not a boss ... I wanted you to love me.\" Both are in pain\u0097Big Daddy because of cancer, Brick because his crutch has (symbolically) been broken, and they need each other's he1p to get upstairs\u0085 Therefore the film ultimately becomes another statement of father-son alienation, and their coming to terms with it, as in \"The Rack\" and \"Somebody Up There Likes Me,\" leads the characters to a new strength (and an upbeat ending not in the play).Despite its compromises, the film was still daring by 1958 standards, and was an enormous commercial success\u0085 It received six Oscar nominations, including one for Newman as Best Actor\u0097his first. Newman had developed, at last, a really impressive acting ability, and a distinctive screen image",

            "review_title": "Not for Williams purists but a great film",
            "content": "Much has been made of the differences between Tennessee Williams' play and this film--the homoerotic themes have been driven further into subtext (though not eliminated entirely) and a more upbeat ending was added.  The changes were necessary when the film was made; although theater and literary purists decry the \"sanitizing\" or censorship of plays when they are adapted for the screen, in some cases (such as this one) the changes can improve the work in question.  \"Cat\" on film is clearer, for one thing.  Tennessee Williams plays tend to be \"cluttered\" in their original form.  They are also cynically downbeat; if that type of story appeals to one, this adaptation might be off-putting.    As with all theatrical adaptations, many of the scenes are excessively talky, especially the Brick/Big Daddy scenes in the second act.  Some of the highlights are just as wordy but thoroughly enjoyable rather than tedious (especially Maggie's story about Mae's reign as Cotton Carnival Queen and the entire scene in the basement).  All of the performances are excellent, though Paul Newman as Brick is less flashy; it's not really until the basement scene that one feels his talent is given a workout.  Elizabeth Taylor is an emotional rollercoaster, venturing from flirtatious to hectoring to wheedling to calm to grasping to tender, often within a single scene, and yet she never slips the rails.  Watching films from this period (her career peak), one wonders what happened to turn her into the vague, bleary-eyed woman we see today.  Judith Anderson's Big Mama is loud, coarse, and bossy, but completely sympathetic both in the scene with the birthday cake and in the confrontation scene at the end.  When Big Daddy invites her along with him at the end, it is every bit as welcome to the viewer as it is to her.  Burl Ives is the most towering of all; the emotional growth in the film is as much his as it is Brick's.  Jack Carson and Madeleine Sherwood are every bit as good despite being relegated to comic relief at times.    My favorite aspect of this story, however, is the social dynamic.  Brick and Maggie are spoiled, young, \"beautiful people\" who have yet to take on any responsibility, while Gooper and Mae are the epitome of a serious young family.  Brick is an alcoholic former football player, while Gooper is a corporate lawyer.  Despite these obvious differences, however, both their parents and the audience (and Tennessee Williams, obviously) clearly prefer Brick and Maggie.  Every aspect of Gooper and Mae's personalities, even those which bespeak traditional values, are portrayed as petty and unimaginative.  Even if one believes that Gooper and Mae have done all the right things, they have done them for the wrong reasons. Thus the theme of the story is most clearly presented:  all that is important is to love and to express that love.",

            "content": "I am studying Tennesse Williams's Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in English. It is a fabulous play, constantly entertaining and witty. I saw the film with great interest, and I was most impressed. Yes the filmmakers did tone down the sexual references and the language and some of the events are simplified or cut(ie. they suppressed Brick's supposed homosexuality) . But even with the changes, the film thanks to the stellar performances and the witty screenplay sizzles fantastically on screen. It is also very gripping and intense, like the play.What makes the play so unique is this. Whereas directors tend to stage what they visualise in their heads when there are no stage directions to show exactly what the playwrights intend, Williams is very specific what he wants throughout. His characterisations are broad and his descriptions of everything down to the bed, which is very symbolic, are detailed. The film, like I said, is toned down, but it still retains the sizzle, wit and intensity of the play with consummate ease.The screenplay is very witty, emotional and funny even. The direction is very good too, and respects Williams's style. The film for its time looks lovely with lovingly designed costumes and skillful cinematography. The music is great, and the editing is crisp.Out of the performances, all of which were stellar in what is really an ensemble piece, Burl Ives stands out especially in a towering spot-on portrayal of the domineering patriarch Big Daddy, and managed to stay true to his character. Paul Newman is splendid as Brick, giving a performance of quiet intensity and broodiness. While she slightly overdid the Daddy Dawling routine, Elizabeth Taylor is deliciously catty and sexy as Maggie, and her and Newman's chemistry was evident throughout. While maybe not quite right in terms of build, Judith Anderson the brilliant actress she was is wholly convincing as Big Mamma. While loud and coarse, she is also sympathetic. Jack Carson plays Gooper well too, Madeleine Sherwood was a tad annoying as Mae, then again I never liked Mae that much in the play anyway.There are many standout scenes, but the one that stood out for me was the scene in the rain with Big Daddy and Brick. Thanks to the contrasting personalities of the two characters and the powerful acting of Ives and Newman, it is one of the most powerful scenes in any film. It makes me wonder why Ives was so overlooked at the Academy Awards really. The final confrontation was also a highlight. All in all, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof has its minor flaws, but it is impeccably acted, atmospheric and very steamy. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Yet another example of a 1950s stage to screen adaptation in which the entire reason for the play's existence is removed from the screen version in order to placate the censors. Why did people even want to make movies out of plays if they wanted to remove everything that made the plays interesting in the first place? Without the homosexual subtext, \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" isn't about very much except Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor disliking each other until they do a complete 180 and get it on in the film's final scene. I guess at the time the pairing of two hot actors was enough to get audiences into the theatres, but that's not good enough now. This is tepid and bland, with uninspired direction, and would make anyone wonder why this Tennessee Williams play is considered to be such a classic.There is one reason to see this film, though, and that's Burl Ives. Newman and Taylor fade into the background, and the movie becomes the story of Ives' Big Daddy, who gives a fascinating, bellicose performance as a dying patriarch, desperately in need of a worthy heir to carry on his legacy. With this and \"The Big Country,\" released the same year, Ives had perhaps the best 1958 of any other actor working at the time.Grade: C",

            "content": "After a run of 694 performances on Broadway during the 1955-1956 season, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof made it to the big screen in 1958, just in time for Elizabeth Taylor to get her second Best Actress nomination in two years. Unfortunately Liz was up against Susan Hayward for I Want to Live and nobody was beating Hayward out that year.But Elizabeth Taylor proved something. She was more than just an extraordinarily beautiful woman. That girl had real talent and she proved to be more than a box office name to insure business.In fact of the original Broadway cast only Burl Ives as Big Daddy and Madeleine Sherwood as his other daughter in law were retained for the film version. Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor replaced Ben Gazzara and Barbara Bel Geddes as the leads.Newman also got one of his early triumphs playing Brick Pollitt, the favored younger son of Big Daddy Pollitt. Brick's an aimless guy, still living out his dreams of glory from being a football player when he was younger. In fact in a drunken stupor he tried some athletic stuff at his former high school and got a broken leg for his troubles. Newman spends the entire film on crutches, with Ives berating him for being a 30 year old kid.The Pollitts are one dysfunctional family. They are awaiting the arrival home of the patriarch Burl Ives from a big name hospital and the news ain't good. Ives is dying and it's how the estate is to be divided that's his concern. Older son Jack Carson as Gooper with Sherwood has five kids with another on the way. A thoroughly obnoxious little group of 'no-neck monsters', but Southern families do like breeders.Brick on the other hand is making a big show of ignoring Elizabeth Taylor and no normal heterosexual male's going to do that for long. Obviously something is eating him, possible infidelity by Liz with his late football buddy Skipper.A whole lot of family skeletons get thrown from the closet before this film is over. Each one of the Pollitts is a deeply flawed human being as Tennessee Williams shows us. Burl Ives as actor was established in this role and in his role in The Big Country for which he got an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. 1958 was that man's career year on screen. Big Daddy Pollitt is a man who worked his way up from nothing, concentrating so much on making a success he had no time for his family.And Paul Newman really is wonderful as a 30 year old kid who if he doesn't straighten out will soon be a 50 year old kid. It's a performance that really rings true for me because I was pretty aimless in my twenties before settling down to the job I held for 23 years before retiring.Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is one of the great pieces of 20th Century American literature. It has some universal lessons we could all profit by in viewing it.",

            "content": "Sultry and downbeat, this Richard Brooks directed film is set at a Southern plantation where a dysfunctional family celebrates the 65th birthday of family patriarch Big Daddy (Burl Ives), a portly man whose health, or the lack of it, is very much on the minds of all the family members. The story centers on one of Big Daddy's two sons, a brooding young man named Brick (Paul Newman) and his childless wife Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor).Brick is reticent and repressed for reasons unknown, and finds relief in alcohol. Beautiful Maggie is concerned that Brick's indifference to Big Daddy may cost them their share of the family inheritance, at the hands of Brick's brother and scheming sister-in-law. Adding fuel to the fire is Brick's prepubescent nieces and nephews, in-your-face brats, whom Maggie refers to, not kindly, as little \"no-neck\" monsters. Big Momma (Judith Anderson) just wants Big Daddy to be physically well, and for everyone to get along.Of course, with a big inheritance on the line, tension erupts, first between Brick and Maggie, then later between them and everyone else. As the tension mounts, arguments erupt into a real down-home Southern soap opera.The film's script is heavy on dialogue. But because of the story's thematic depth, the issues are interesting and insightful, and the script never seems talky. At the heart of the story is the subject of mendacity, of lies and not telling the truth. There is considerable emotional pain, expressed as anger, resentment, and sarcasm. The story, originated by Tennessee Williams, goes against its era, in that it contradicts the virtues of traditional family values and capitalism.Casting and acting are quite good. But Burl Ives' performance is wonderful, and alone makes the film worth watching. Color cinematography is conventional. It's a slow-paced film with long camera \"takes\". Sets and production design are lavish.Because the dreadful Hays Code censored much of the thematic content in 1958, the film's conclusion is weak and does not justify Brick's emotional state. This is not a criticism of the film, but of the Hays Code itself which, mercifully, was abolished in the 1960s.Dripping with Southern atmosphere, and with a sultry jazz score, \"Cat On A Hot Tin Roof\" is a terrific movie, for its thematic value, its cast, and the splendid performance of Burl Ives.",

            "content": "For years I was turned off from watching this movie. I tried once, but found that the movie looked like an episode of MOMMA'S FAMILY where they finally gave everyone meat cleavers and told them to mix it up good!! It was that ugly and tough to watch in only the first 10 or 15 minutes, so I just turned it off and assumed it was not my type of movie. Thankfully, I tried it again and realized it was an exceptional film in every way.The movie is essentially a film about how everyone in the family is dealing with the imminent death of the family patriarch, Big Daddy. For some odd and annoying reason, everyone has nicknames like \"Big Momma\", \"Big Sister\", etc. but considering this is my only complaint, it's no big deal really.The problem is that the family is at heart really screwed up. The oldest son, played by Jack Carson, is the \"good\" son who became a lawyer and is superficially dutiful, though down deep he does everything to try to maneuver himself and his evil brood into the best position when the loot is divvied up when Big Daddy dies. It's totally sick the way he and his obnoxious brood fawn over Big Daddy so unconvincingly in order to ingratiate themselves.His wife, Mae, played by Madeleine Sherwood, is probably the most detestable of all the adults in the film. Just how awful she is is revealed more and more as the film progresses, as she has both the mouth and heart of a viper AND she choreographs the kids to do some major sucking up to Big Daddy. This sucking up is so saccharine and annoying that Big Daddy obviously detested the kids! The children are basically evil spawns of Satan, as their parents allow them to do ANYTHING so long as they suck up to Big Daddy and Big Mamma. When the film starts, one of the brats is reaching her hands into a big bowl of ice cream--ruining it for everyone. When she sees her Aunt Maggie (Liz Taylor) she throws a huge handful on her. Another of these darlings later laughs at Aunt Maggie and taunts her because she doesn't have any kids! They did a great job of playing horrid kids, as I found myself wanting to strangle them.Aunt Maggie is also pretty mercenary, though is much more subtle and likable than her brother-in-law and sister-in-law and the little demons. But she and her husband, Brick, played by Paul Newman, have a stormy marriage at best. Of all the kids and in-laws, the only one without designs on the fortune is Brick, who is so full of self-pity and self-loathing that all he really is interested in is staying drunk.Big Mamma, played by Judith Anderson, is pretty ineffectual and lives in a constant state of denial. Otherwise, she would have to admit to herself that her kids are creeps and her husband doesn't care at all about her.Big Daddy, played by Burl Ives, is a loud and obnoxious man who as insensitive and blunt. His way of showing love is through money and success. He appears to realize the score on everyone and where they stand--except for himself. Here he's got a huge blind spot--thinking he's done a fine job when the problems he sees are in many ways his own doing.Initially, Big Daddy thinks that the stomach pains he's been having are not very serious--after all, that's what the doctor has told him. However, he's dying of cancer and his time left is very short. Once he learns this is so, he actually stops yelling and the most poignant part of the film begins. His conversation with Brick about the illness and the future is one of the finest moments in movie history. In particular, Paul Newman's performance nearly brought me to tears. It was only then that real raw feelings and pain began to emerge and the movie began to feel so real and wonderful.Where all this goes from there you just need to see for yourself. I had a hard time choosing whether or not to give the movie a 9 or a 10, but I tend to be more conservative than some and reserve 10s for only a very select group of films--and this one nearly made it. See it and be amazed.PS--A final interesting note is that one of the kids playing the brats was Rusty Stevens--\"Larry Mondello\" from the old LEAVE IT TO BEAVER show. Look quickly at the kid running around with the sparkler--it's him. He's not listed in the credits, but is on IMDb and I'm sure it's him.",

            "content": "Perhaps the original \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" with Barbara Bel Geddes and Ben Gazzara was so ground-breaking in its stage debut that no revival could possibly touch it, although a 1990's revival with Kathleen Turner was rumored to be excellent. The recent Broadway revival was so slow- moving and poorly cast that I had to side with Mae (\"Sister Woman\") in her battle with \"Maggie the Cat\". The original film version, however (not the braying 1975 TV remake with Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner), was so hot, that it wasn't only the roof that was practically on fire.From the moment you see Paul Newman as Brick and Elizabeth Taylor as Maggie, you know that you're in for a sexy time, even though this married couple is lacking in that department. It's a family fight to the finish for Brick, his older brother Gooper (Jack Carson), thanks to pushy \"sister woman\" Madeline Sherwood, and also a fight for the affections and heritage of their parents, Big Daddy (the powerful Burl Ives) and Big Mama (Judith Anderson, cast totally against type yet amazing). Big Daddy may or may not be dying, and only his doctor (soap veteran Larry Gates, who played his own \"Big Daddy\" type on \"Guiding Light\") knows for sure. The little no-necked monsters harass Aunt Maggie so much that after one of them throws ice cream at her, that little \"Bad Seed\" gets her own come-uppance and deservedly so. Tennessee Williams wrote many classic plays, but this is for sure his sexiest (even if the undertones of homosexuality have been removed from the movie) and most popular screen adaption. It is a shame that Newman and Taylor only made this one film together, as their chemistry is as hot as anything Newman did with his own wife Joanne Woodward and even more so than most films which Taylor did with her later husband Richard Burton.Fans of \"The Flying Nun\" will be shocked to see the future \"Reverand Mother\" playing such a meddlesome character, far from the stern but loving nun. Madeline Sherwood made infrequent film appearances over the years, working mostly on stage, yet always stood out in these rare screen roles. Burl Ives, who won the Oscar for Supporting Actor the same year for \"The Big Country\" is certainly worthy for a Lead Actor nomination here. His bellowing of \"Mendacity!\" is certainly unforgettable. Judith Anderson may seem too strong in certain scenes for the sometimes pathetic Big Mama, but she takes on the role with gusto, showing us that underneath this devoted, sometimes clinging woman, is a mother lion who can fight with the best of them.Beautifully filmed in color and certainly ahead of its time in theme (even missing the gay undertones of Brick's friendship with the late Skipper), this is a difficult film to top. Director Richard Brooks takes time giving each character something important to say about the insides of their soul, faithfully transporting the stage text to screen and making this a true classic.",

            "content": "That odor of mendacity permeates the entire film, as it does in all dysfunctional families. Fully character and dialog driven, this adaptation of the Tennessee Williams play brings out all the power and raw emotion of the principal players, Newman, Taylor and Ives. It's not much of a stretch to say that Paul Newman and Liz Taylor are one of the physically best looking screen couples ever, even if their roles demand a detached relationship fostered by Brick Pollitt's (Newman) refusal to outgrow his past. Even in this whitewashed version of Brick's personal relationship with his deceased best friend, one is provided enough subtle hints that there may have been more to to his angst than the mere death of a childhood buddy.The dysfunction carries over into the rest of the Pollitt family. As Big Daddy (Burl Ives) returns from the hospital, initially unaware that he's dying, elder son Gooper (Jack Carson) is already laying the groundwork for the passing of the family fortune. I don't know about you, but his wife (Madeiline Sherwood) might be one of the most unsympathetic and downright nasty characters ever to grace the big screen. Gooper couldn't hold her back most of the time, as she burned bridges left and right in an effort to muscle in on Big Daddy's wealth.Where the story really hits stride though is the cellar scene with Brick and Big Daddy laying it on the line with each other for the first time in their lives. I kept watching that life size poster of Newman in his football gear just wondering when it was going to go. Sure enough, Brick takes an iron to it's destruction in a spiritual cleansing that has him admit that he never felt loved by his father. When written well, this kind of father-son conflict can make for some powerful drama, and Williams' pen was never finer than it was here.",

The reality is, this film is a piece of cinema and drama history.  You'd need to be a \"Williams Fundamentalist\" to hate the movie for its toned-down-ness.  To the balanced Williams fan, it is gripping, well acted and nicely-paced.  Once every 10-15 years there is a truly fine production of this play in a world-class theatre.

It was great but very long (at least 3 hours) and the once shocking subject matter was very tame. This movie cut the play quite a bit but they had to--the Hays Code was still in effect. The language was toned down and all mention of Brick's homosexuality and Big Daddy having cancer was cut out. Still they get it across. Brick's relationship with Skipper is hinted at STRONGLY without actually saying it was physical and what Big Daddy is dying of is never made clear but they say it's terminal. That aside this is still strong and pretty powerful. The acting really pulls this one through. Newman, Taylor and Judith Anderson (as \"Big Mama\") are great but Ives played this on stage (and won a Tony) so he has his part down pat and really gives it his all. He dominates every scene he's in. Script wise this is tame. The situations are predictable and the resolutions are far too pat for me. But the acting is so good I really didn't notice while watching it. Also this is the only film Taylor and Newman ever did together.

We think it's all about sex, but if it were, they would have jumped each other long ago (My GOD, LOOK at them!!  It's Newman and Taylor).  This is a relationship full of confusion, betrayal, honesty, dishonesty, love, desire, and trust.  The phenomenal symbolism of Brick's crutch is beautifully represented.The play was wonderful, and the movie was wonderful, but it is important to remember that they are two separate entities.

Burl Ives, best supporting actor Oscar winner that same year for \"The Big Country,\" is wonderful as Big Daddy, the favor who tried to shower his family with material things, but had no love in his heart for them.The film begins where the family gathers for Daddy's 65th birthday, knowing a terrible secret-Big Daddy is fatally ill.While we have a great premise with the latter's illness, the film soon develops into a tug of war between Newman's Brick and Taylor's Maggie. As the ex-football hero, Newman has descended into alcoholism and it is later revealed that he can't forgive his wife's treachery with his best friend, who later killed himself. Maggie, as the strong, but needy for love woman, matches Newman in every way in all their scenes.It is only when Big Daddy's illness is revealed, the family is able to come to grips with it and the older son and daughter-in-law, Jack Carson and Madeleine Sherwood, are exposed for what they really are. Carson has his moments, but Sherwood is absolutely wonderful in the role of the abusive sister-in-law.The cast also includes Dame Judith Anderson as Big Mama, the long-suffering wife to Daddy. She perfects a fine southern slang for the role, but in the scene where Daddy admonishes her, she suddenly sounds as if she is Mrs. Danvers (\"Rebecca\") or Memnit from \"The Ten Commandments.\"This is a story of family dysfunction, and ultimate redemption.

            "content": "\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" was part of Hollywood's Tennessee Williams cycle of the fifties and early sixties, along with films such as \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", \"Suddenly Last Summer\", \"Sweet Bird of Youth\", \"Period of Adjustment\" and \"Night of the Iguana\". Like \"Streetcar\u0085\" it is set in New Orleans. It revolves around the various members of the wealthy Pollitt family, who have gathered to celebrate the birthday of their elderly patriarch, known to all as Big Daddy.Perhaps the two most important characters are Big Daddy's son Brick, once a star athlete and successful football player, and his wife Maggie. Their marriage is in trouble; Brick, who has a serious drink problem, has lost all sexual interest in Maggie, although she is not only beautiful but also still very much in love with him. He is obsessed by the memory of his best friend and one-time team-mate Skipper, who has killed himself. To comply with the Production Code, there is no direct suggestion in the film that Brick and Skipper were homosexual lovers, although it is still possible to read an implied gay subtext into it.The other members of the family are Big Daddy's wife Ida, Brick's elder brother Gooper and his wife Mae. Gooper is a very different man to his brother. Whereas Brick and Maggie are childless, Gooper and Mae have five children. Whereas Brick is an unemployed alcoholic, Gooper is a successful lawyer. And yet Big Daddy still retains a greater affection for Brick, largely because he senses a greater honesty and decency in him; Gooper and the pushy, mercenary Mae are rather too obviously manoeuvring to inherit the family fortune on Big Daddy's death.One of the dominating strands in Brick's character is his disgust with mendacity, a characteristic he sees not only in his own family but in the wider society around him. (Lies and delusions are a common theme in Williams' work; a number of his other characters, such as Blanche Dubois in \"Streetcar\", seem to be living a lie). His descent into alcoholism has been caused partly by Skipper's suicide but also partly by the disgust he feels against a society which he sees as dishonest. Big Daddy is, in fact, terminally ill with cancer, but his doctor and the rest of the family have conspired to keep this information from him. Only Brick has the honesty to tell him, and when he does father and son start to rediscover their love for one another. Although the film deals with some very negative emotions, it ends on a note of hope and possible reconciliation.1958 was the year that saw the sudden, and unexpected, emergence of Burl Ives, previously better known as a country singer, as a film star. Here he is great as Big Daddy, coming across as the overbearing paterfamilias in the early scenes and then revealing his more human side, especially in his conversations with Brick, after he realises that he is dying. Ives was to give an even better , Oscar-winning, performance later in the same year playing another patriarch, Rufus Hannassey in \"The Big Country\".Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor were a generation younger than Ives, but both were already established stars by 1958. \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\", however, perhaps offered them their most challenging roles to date, and both rose to the challenge very well, proving that they deserved to be known for their acting as well as their looks. (Both were nominated for Oscars).The tortured Brick is rather different from the cool, detached outsiders like Cool Hand Luke and Chance Wayne in \"Sweet Bird\" whom Newman would become famous for playing in the sixties, although like them he has a rebellious, nonconformist side to his nature. Taylor gives a notably sultry, seductive and passionate performance as Maggie, the \"cat on a hot tin roof\" of the title. Madeleine Sherwood is also good as the obnoxious Mae.This film represents a milestone in the advance of colour photograph at the expense of black-and-white in the cinema. In the fifties there was something of a convention that monochrome was used for serious, intellectual drama and colour for spectacular films, such as musicals, Westerns and other action films and romances. All previous Williams adaptations had been in black-and-white, and some later ones were to be. (\"Night of the Iguana\" was made in monochrome as late as 1964). Director Richard Brooks, however, clearly felt that colour was more appropriate to the passionate, emotional nature of Williams' writing, as he used it both here and in \"Sweet Bird of Youth\".In my view \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" is, along with \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", the best of the various filmed Williams adaptations. It may not be 100% faithful to the original play, but it nevertheless works well in its own right as a powerful, emotive family drama. 8/10",

They find themselves at his father's house where everyone thinks Big Daddy (Burt Ives) might be dying and some have their hands out.CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF is without question one of the best adaptations of any Williams' story. The 50s were full of adaptation and while this one isn't quite as excellent as A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE it does come pretty darn close. The greatest thing about this picture is that it contains three excellent performances by the leads as well as some wonderful performances by the supporting players. If you love great dialogue and great acting then this is a movie for you.Taylor and Newman are the legends in the cast but it's actually Ives who steals the picture with his tremendous and fiery performance as Big Daddy. Ives will always be remembered for his voice but my Lord does he do a remarkable job here. There's a lot of anger to his character and many talented actors would take it over the top but Ives never does that. Just watching him work this character is quite unforgettable. Both Newman and Taylor are also excellent together and they share some terrific fireworks together. You really believe them as this troubled character and both get to show off their ranges. Jack Carson, Judith Anderson and Madeleine Sherwood are also excellent.The dialogue is quite sharp and even with the alterations it still packs that Williams' punch. I know some criticize the homosexuality being removed from the story but I think the undertones are still on display and easy to see. The music score is remarkable well-done and there's no doubt that the cinematography perfectly picks up the heat in the film.

            "content": "Being from Mississippi, and actually born in the same town as Williams himself, I have a cultural right to be extremely picky about this film, so I must begin with two down-home criticisms. A Mississippi delta accent is a very, very specific sound, and most of the cast miss it by a mile--with Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman the worst offenders of the lot. That aside, the Mississippi delta simply doesn't look like the brief bits of landscape we're allowed to see in the film, and the architecture of the big house is also extremely unlikely for that area. So if you're actually expecting to find any sense of the region, you're out of luck. Most viewers probably won't notice these problems, but they are a drawback, for William's work is always as much about place as about character and plot, and the film's failure to accurately capture it is a disservice to both audience and creator.That said, the big problem with CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF is 1950s censorship: it simply wasn't possible to film a play about an unconsciously homosexual man's inability to forgive his oversexed wife for her role in his pseudo-lover's death. As a result, the film sidesteps the entire issue and focuses on the sub-plot of just who is going to inherit Big Daddy's estate when he dies. Accents aside, the cast does quite well, with supporting players Anderson, Carson, and Sherwood particular standouts--but the end result is just so much steam without substance, well done but not particularly meaningful.Gary F.

I was not familiar with anything Cat on a Hot Tin Roof related, so I found this to be a pretty grim, yet rewarding experience. We don't have anybody to root for, really. Many of the characters are self absorbed, and have many questionable motives, especially the daughter of Big Daddy; Mae (Madeline Sherwood) It's hard to like a person who clearly just cares about money and inheritance, rather than her ailing father, and her family. Brick Pollit (Newman's character) is hard to endure, as he wallows in misery for almost the entire film, while drinking almost non- stop. His cold and somewhat callous character at times is quite depressing to watch. I did admire how the movie slowly builds its mystery, and developed the characters. When it is revealed as to why Brick is so callous, I managed to empathize with his plight a little bit more. Paul Newman is incredible in this film, and managed to convey his emotions to near perfection. For a man to be so unlikable for most of the film, and win me over near the end, takes a lot of talent. I did understand his frustration, though in a way. His chemistry with Elizabeth Taylor is unforgettable, and the two often provide magic on the screen. Elizabeth Taylor is just as vital to the film's success as Newman, and she was equally as good. Maggie is a housewife who I would love to have as my wife. The stuff she endures and puts up with is amazing. I give Elizabeth Taylor just as much credit as Paul Newman. Both of their performances are absolutely legendary. Burl Ives eccentricities serve this film well,and his imposing performance was excellent. His character isn't all that sympathetic either. He's brazen, stubborn, and treats his wife like dirt, but he was very good. I've given this film a bit of criticism due to its mean spiritedness, but I actually really liked the film. It's very engrossing. The amazing performances and the well done story are more than worthy to give this film a high recommendation. It's just very grim to watch. 8.3/10",

            "content": "Some 95% of the IMDb comments on \"Cat...\" concentrate on its stars/performances, and justly so: that's about all there is to this static, bowdlerized adaptation of Tennessee Williams' Pulitzer Prize-winning play. In 1958, director/writer Richard Brooks had the questionable distinction of bastardizing TWO masterpieces in the SAME year, Williams' \"Cat...\" and Dostoyevsky's \"The Brothers Karamazov\" (remember that ending?).\"Cat...\" is basically an all-talk psychodrama (if you're not fluent in English, be prepared to read a lot of subtitles!), as we watch a dysfunctional family dysfunctioning to the hilt, in another of Williams' exorcism of his ghosts (in \"Cat...\" 's particular case: his relationship with his brutish father, his coming out of the closet, his alcoholism, his tragic relationship back in the 1940s with his first male lover that eventually left him to get married, only to die of a brain tumor in 1944 with Williams at his deathbed).It's difficult to take this adaptation seriously when two of the main themes of the play were either entirely eliminated (homosexualism) or trivialized (alcoholism -- how can a serious drunkard look as healthy and fresh-faced as Paul Newman?). The problem of eliminating the homosexual innuendos of Brick's relationship with Skipper -- besides the grave fact that Brooks betrayed the very core of the play -- is that Brooks doesn't come up with anything consistent in its place. The \"new\" motivations for Brick's trauma (that led him to become an alcoholic and sexually reject Maggie) are at first vaguely mysterious and then an over-sized bubble, because they amount to nothing much. What Brooks did to the play was worse than white-washing; it was an act of...mendacity!! Oh, the irony of it all:)Williams himself dismissed Brooks' adaptation, saying it looked \"like prostitution or corruption\", that he \"cheats on the material, sweetens it up and makes it all hunky-dory\". It's said Williams even publicly advised audiences not to see the movie. Nevertheless, he wasn't exactly physically tortured to accept (reportedly) half a million dollars for the film rights :) Anyway, he would show Brooks and Hollywood a thing or two the next year, when he adapted (with Gore Vidal) his own play \"Suddenly Last Summer\" for the screen, making homosexuality its unequivocal (though encrypted) center, even if homosexual \"pervert\" Sebastian gets his \"deserved punishment\" at the end, being literally eaten alive!Brooks' version of \"Cat...\" is disappointingly static; the camera's only interested in its stars. But then, what stars! Taylor and Newman are really one of the most spectacular screen couples ever. Liz -- probably never more beautiful -- hadn't however finished peeling off that early \"nice girl\" quality (it was her first real \"nasty\" role) and still lacked the delicious \"trampiness\" that would bloom in the 60s (though she has a shrill laughing scene by the mirror, at the beginning, that is delightfully vulgar and sexy). Paul Newman, also at his hottest, tries hard (and he's always pretty aware of his cinematic wooing powers) but is ultimately miscast: looking invariably sober and impeccably healthy, with not a shadow of anguish in his All-American brow, he doesn't succeed in portraying the compulsion to drink, the nihilist decay, the uptight despair to his part (imagine what Brando or Clift could have brought to the role). It's very hard to think of him as the complete loser Brick is. Burl Ives, physically impressive, chews everything around him in the Emil-Jannings-acting-school fashion (OK, so Big Daddy is bigger than life -- one more reason to smuggle in an occasional subtlety). Jack Carson is wasted in the under-developed part of his potentially very interesting character (Brick's underdog brother Gooper). Judith Anderson as the hysterical, torn apart Big Mama, and Madeleine Sherwood, as the nightmarish hag \"sister-woman\", have a ball with their roles, all stops out.\"Cat...\" is ultimately disappointing because it's glamorous when it should have been grim, and just repetitive when it should have been obsessive. However, it has star power to spare, some of the dialog is Williams at his poisonous best and there are some undeniably effective scenes: when Big Mama confronts Maggie saying that troubles in marriage have but one cause -- while firmly pounding her open hand on Maggie's mattress -- the film suddenly becomes alive for a moment.",

            "content": "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is one of those Hollywood classics that only get better and gain more significance as time goes by. It's based on a play by Tennessee Williams and, as usually in his plays, many references and unmentioned taboos can be found, such as homosexuality. Both the director and the script writer, Richard Brooks and James Poe, knew what kind of volatile and controversial issues were hidden in the play. But by highlighting different aspects and using professional actors with whom the audience was already familiar, they succeed in making a big commercial hit which, by all means, doesn't mean that its cinematographic or artistic value would be any lower.Paul Newman plays Brick, an alcoholic injured ex-football player, who rejects the affections of his wife, Maggie, played by Elizabeth Taylor. When Brick's father who is dying of cancer pays a visit, painful and hidden secrets from the past start to reveal themselves. Such as the odd relationship between Brick and his football buddy, Skipper, who has committed a suicide.Most of all, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is a story about father son relationship but it drills down deeper. Homosexuality, the relationship between Brick and Skipper, is an unmentioned taboo. In the 1950's even the pronunciation of the word was forbidden and censored. So Brooks had to find a substitute for homosexuality, something that wouldn't harm the play but something that the audience was able to accept. He highlighted the emotional immaturity of the protagonist. The film needed a reason why Brick would turn Maggie down but it couldn't be homosexuality, never. Brooks, together with the writer, solved this issue by one extremely charged scene. The scene, where Brick threatens Maggie with his crutch, because she's seducing him. From her arms Brick escapes to the bathroom where there is Maggie's bathrobe. Brick takes the bathrobe and embeds his face in it. The bathrobe, of course, symbolizes Maggie herself and the scene proves that Brick still truly yearns for her.The film's explanation for Brick's rejection of Maggie is his emotional immaturity. He is unable to grow up and face the challenges of adulthood. This is also the basic reason for his devotion to Skipper who has encouraged his desire to stay as a boyish football hero. Brick wants to believe that Maggie is responsible for Skipper's death; he rejects Maggie because the death of Skipper means the death of the boyish world in which he lived together with him. The theme of emotional immaturity was already a part of Williams' play but Brooks had to highlight it to hide the homosexuality even deeper. The suicide committed by Skipper is one of those hidden secrets that lie in the plays by Tennessee Williams. The secrets which rise to the surface in the climax where the characters have to face them.But, to my mind, homosexuality is just one of the layers of this multidimensional film which can even survive the toughest analyses regarding stylistics. In the aesthetics of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof nature and material meet each other; the garden and the indoors. The storm and the quarrel become comparable. The film starts with a sunny weather. It's Bid Daddy's (Brick's father) birthday, who has had cancer for some time but now everything is supposed to be just fine, he's getting better. Until it is revealed that the doctor was lying. Big Daddy is dying of cancer after all. Suddenly rain, thunder and darkness descend over the mansion. The weather is, of course, metaphorical to what happens inside the house and, in the end, the rain stops. The storm didn't do much harm to the garden, unlike indoors; to the human relationships.In addition to its description of father son relationship and homosexuality, it's a film about materialism and the illusion of bourgeois peace and happiness. Big Daddy has tried to fix the mistakes he has done in his life by material, by giving things to his family he never got from his father. Materialism, wealth and loveless love characterize the film as none of the characters really love each other: Brick rejects Maggie, his relationship with Skipper seems quite possessive, Brick's brother's relationship with his wife is artificial to say the least, and even Big Daddy admits that he hasn't really loved Brick's mother -- the bourgeoisie doesn't love each other, not even themselves. The facade of idyllic life and the American dream is stripped down from all its illusionary form to reality of anxiety and depression.Such conventional issues like alcoholism, depression and stagnation are everyday life for the characters. But in the life of the bourgeoisie it's just hidden below the surface. These themes culminate brilliantly in the scene where Brick runs outside of the mansion with his father. He tries to drive away, drunk, but the car's wire sticks to the mud. It's impossible to move, to live and to actually love. Desolation, loveless love and decay of morality hide in every corner. The spoiled children of Brick's brother, unfulfilled dreams, misfortune and desperation. The children of capitalism meet reality, which isn't glamorous nor pretty at all.",

            "content": "Based on a now well-known play by Tennessee Williams, \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" is an intermittently interesting but mostly overly verbose, overly theatrical, overly hysterical film by director Richard Brooks.Set in the American South, \"Cat\" sees Paul Newman playing the favourite son of Big Daddy, a wealthy plantation owner who's dying of cancer. Daddy's first son, played by Jack Carson, and Daddy's obnoxious wife, played by Madeleine Sherwood, anxiously await Daddy's estate.Like Williams' play, Brooks' film captures well a certain complexity. He deftly traces the motivations and histories of his characters and then goes on to treat Big Daddy's cancer as being representative of a more generalised human cancer which grows and infects everyone present. It's this sickness which Newman's character sees and diagnoses and wants no part of. To say any more would be to spoil the plot.The film co-stars Elizabeth Taylor as Newman's firecracker wife. Newman's character was presented as being homosexual in Williams' play, but this pre Hays Code versions teats Newman as simply being \"emotionally confused.\" As filmed theatre, \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" is fine, but it's still only filmed theatre. Compare to Kurosawa's \"Ran\", essentially an adaptation of Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" (Williams' play is also about a king who disperses his kingdom), but which is wholly cinematic.7.5/10 \u2013 Worth one viewing.",

Few films date as badly as this one. Nor do many from that decade illustrate its afflictions more vividly than Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Pitched about 10 decibels too high so that the audience can confuse loud talk with superior acting, the result is more annoying than thought-provoking or even, perish the thought, entertaining. For a screenplay that prides itself on honesty, what could be more \"mendacious\" than excising playwrite Williams' homosexual theme from the endless palaver, leaving the audience of that day and this pondering just what is Brick's problem. This is two hours of sound and fury that finally boils down to the tritest of messages-- boys need fatherly love. And how transparent are several of the characters, especially the luckless no-neck clan who make even a Gene Autry B-Western appear sophisticated by comparison. Only Newman manages to come through with professional dignity intact. To think that a slew of Academy Award nominations went to this overheated gab fest proves once again that the awards are more about investments than artistic invention. So pass this one up unless you have a yen for a punctured eardrum and a headache.",

In my opinion, it's not Tennessee Williams' masterpiece, and the supporting characters can get on the audience's nerves pretty quickly. The only reason I can imagine why everyone wants to take a crack at it is because the original is so beloved, other actors say to themselves, \"I want to be Elizabeth Taylor!\" or \"I want to be Paul Newman!\" If you've never seen a Tennessee Williams story, here's the skinny: It's set in the South, a key plot point is a sexual problem, there's an \"old world\" family drama, a hint of male homosexuality, and it's usually all during a very hot summer. Also, the movies are based off of plays, so there will be lots of monologues. I'm not dissing Tennessee Williams; I actually love many of his plays. I just wanted to let you know what to expect.In Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, a childless married couple is on the brink of divorce. They bicker and argue, all through the wife's family's visit. If you've heard of the characters Maggie the Cat or Big Daddy, they originate from this story. Obviously, with two beautiful people in the lead roles, this movie is enjoyable to watch, and the tension between them sparks off the screen.

            "content": "Trimmed, one might say altered, from the play that Tennessee Williams wrote about a marriage on the rocks because the husband still lusted after his dead friend. Of course, it was 1958 and homosexuality in a mainstream movie was a no-no, at least in so far as it was pivotal to the plot. So instead we have a dead friend who seduces the wife but whom the husband won't believe capable of such betrayal. (He blames her for everything; the seduction, his friend's death, his own drinking).Even in this bowdlerized version \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" still packs a punch and despite its confined setting, (24 hours in a Southern mansion ruled over by 'Big Daddy', the boozy hero's dying father). There is a lot of plot to get through. You see, Big Daddy has been in the hospital having tests and now he's had the all-clear so his family, sons Brick, (the boozer with the dead friend) and Gooper, the sensible older one and their wives Maggie, who likens her situation of that of a cat on a hot tin roof, and Mae, (Sister Woman; well, it is Tennessee Williams, after all), as well as 'Big Mamma', have gathered to celebrate his birthday. Except Big Daddy hasn't got the all-clear and despite all the mendacity going on around him he would rather leave his fortune to his rebel son Brick, who fights against him, than to the toadying Gooper and his pack of brats, but Brick and Maggie are childless and Brick has stopped sleeping with his wife for the reasons already stated.Perhaps all of this is resolved rather too neatly but getting there is a lot of fun. The adaptation, by director Richard Brooks and James Poe, still retains a good deal of Williams' poetic dialogue and the performances are terrific. This was Paul Newman's breakthrough performance and he gives Brick a louche sexuality as he hobbles around on his crutch, (caused by a drunken accident on the football field), mostly in pajamas.Burl Ives makes Big Daddy both pathetic and frightening almost simultaneously. (You can see the rod of iron with which he rules slowly slipping from his hand as he approaches death). As Gooper and Sister Woman, Jack Carson and Madeleine Sherwood perfectly convey the hideousness of an all-American marriage based solely on the love of the dollar. Best of all there is Elizabeth Taylor as Maggie the Cat. The critic Dilys Powell was quick to point out that Taylor was born to play Tennessee Williams and her performance here is almost equal to her performance as Martha in \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\". She was probably never more stunningly photographed, (in Metrocolour by William Daniels), than here and she seems to have an intuitive sense of what it is that makes Maggie tick. It's a great tragic-comic performance. She is a woman on the verge of losing everything, struggling to save her marriage and hold her life together but up to recognizing the absurdity of her situation. She really is quite terrific.Of all American directors with a facility for taking plays and novels to the screen and largely keeping them intact Richard Brooks was among the best and \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" is still one of his best films, (and probably among the best film versions of any play yet filmed).",

            "content": "The problem with the movie version of Tennessee Williams' Cat On a Hot Tin Roof is not the censorship so much (which removed the homosexual aspect of the story, though it's still there for the more perceptive viewers) but the play itself. Director Richard Brooks does a decent job with it, but the play's the thing, and the play ain't that good. I have no problem with the movie. Elizabeth Taylor is well cast as Maggie the Cat, Paul Newman is apprpriately brooding and convincingly impotent as her husband Brick, Burl Ives bellows authoritatively as Big Daddy, and Jack Carson is almost painfully good as Newman's sycophantic brother Gooper, who in some ways is more impotent than his sibling. The story can basically be summed up as 'Daddy's dyin' and who's got the will', or rather the money. It is set in the contemporary South. Much of what goes on hinges on the refusal on the part of son Brick to have sex with his wife. Since the old man is dying he wants to help favorite son (and ne'er do well) Brick, but is more or less forced by circumstances to prefer Gooper, who has children who will keep the family going. Big Daddy holds Gooper in contempt. He is concerned over Brick's drinking,  sexual problems, and his personality in general. The conflict between father and son is as much the focal point of the play as the son's sex stuff. I find this play somewhat repulsive; it's as sycophantic as Gooper. Williams aims his pen, so to speak, at the heart of Middle America. He is out to enlighten his audience on sexual matters; also on life in the then still exotic Deep South. I have no problems with either of these goals except that as issues they don't belong in a serious play; they belong in the back pages of magazines like The New Republic and The Nation. I believe it is beneath Williams' enormous talent for him to curry favor with his audience the way he does here, with his ostentatious 'Southernisms', as in terms of endearment such as 'sister woman', and in Maggie's calling herself 'Maggie the Cat', and all the talk about the kids as 'no neck monsters'. This is sitcom stuff. Williams' language, so beautiful in The Glass Menageries and A Streetcar Named Desire, fails him here. The sexy aspect of the play, big news in the fifties, is not news at all any more. Thus the sensationalism, so crucial a factor in the play's success, is missing. I felt continually manipulated into reacting to the material in a certain way. Unlike in his earlier works, Williams doesn't give his audience much breathing space; there's little room here to form a personal interpetation. Williams sets things up so that either Cat is a 'laugh riot',--and of course devilishly sophisticated as well--or it is nothing, a mere anecdote, a failed epiphany maybe. It is a mediocre  play, all the more disappointing because its author is anything but, and so the occasional flashes of brilliance become more irritating than revelatory, only serving to remind us that Williams could do so much better. Yet it is if nothing else well-crafted. Williams' professionalism does not fail him here. Cat belongs to its time, before girls wore bikinis on the beach, when homosexuality, hell, sexuality in general, was spoken about in whispers by polite people, and even then not too often. The play owes a huge debt to Freud and Freudian analysis, which Williams was in at the time, and it shows.",

            "content": "Like most of the movie-going world, last night I commemorated the recent passing of veteran actor Paul Newman by watching one of his films. 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958)' was among Newman's earliest big-name roles, and one that catapulted this humble, affable performer into Hollywood's A-list. The film, the latest in a series of Tennessee Williams play adaptations, was directed by Richard Brooks, even though Elia Kazan {who had also helmed the screen versions of 'A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)' and 'Baby Doll (1956)'} had directed the stage version. It was theatre adaptations like this that proved Hollywood's greatest opportunity to produce \"artistic\" pictures, and, accordingly, such films were usually shot in black-and-white. However, with the casting of Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman the wise decision was made to film in colour, to capitalise on those vibrant violet and blue eyes, respectively. Though I hear that considerable changes were made to Williams' original play (much to the author's chagrin), Richard Brooks' film has the intimate, claustrophobic feel of a stage production.Former footballer Brick Pollitt (Newman), in the year since the death of his close friend and teammate, has quit his job and descended into bouts of vicious drinking. He and wife Maggie (Taylor), to whom he has become cold, have arrived at the vast estate of his father \"Big Daddy\" (Burt Ives), who is suspected to have contracted terminal cancer. While Big Daddy tries to come to terms with his situation, Maggie tries to restore her failing and childless marriage, lest she lose the old man's considerable fortune to Brick's brother Gooper (Jack Carson) and his gruesome family of \"no-neck monsters.\" Throughout a hot, humid evening that culminates in a cleansing torrent of rain, the family of characters attempt to reconcile their differences, convinced that they can no longer simply run from their problems. The story ends on an ambiguous note \u0096 not quite tragic, but hardly optimistic either \u0096 as Brick decides to simply accept the lies and mendacity in his life, even if it means making nightly love to a woman for whom he feels nothing but an obligation.Fortunately, given the film's intimate focus on characters and relationships, the cast is very well-chosen. Elizabeth Taylor, then a Hollywood star for well over a decade, brings a conflicted beauty to the screen, the persona of a woman trying desperately to retain an image of grace and happiness, and yet not quite pulling it off. She also sports one of those annoying Southern accents that, had she been anybody other than Elizabeth Taylor, would have driven me up the wall. Paul Newman spends the first half of the film reserved and isolated, but, through his interactions with Big Daddy, finally begins to open up about what he's really feeling. A subplot concerning Brick's sexuality was among the themes excised from Williams' original play to appease the Production Code, but the subtext nonetheless simmers slightly beneath the surface, all the better for not deliberately drawing attention to itself. All in all, 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958)' is a film that's impossible not to admire, even if I can't honestly confess to having loved it.",

            "content": "A top-notch adaptation of Tennessee Williams' classic play, the first screen version of CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF is a wrenching and intense character study that brings out the best of nearly every individual involved. Williams' source material is arguably his greatest play (rivaled primarily by A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE) and it is expertly adapted to screen by screenwriter/director Richard Brooks. Although the racier elements of Williams' dialogue is either toned down or eliminated, Brooks remains remarkably faithful to structure of Williams' story and its characters. Brooks wisely regulates his screenplay to the basics of the play, which allows plenty of time for him to reach into his lead character's minds.The film is remarkably gripping and intense for such a leisurely-paced, dialogue-heavy film. As a director, Brooks manages to wring every bit of tension out of the source material without attempting to expand the narrative, which surely would have placed the film in danger of losing focus. Although the MGM production values are typically lavish, Brooks maintains a marvelously claustrophobic aura throughout the entire film that somehow manages to remain faithful to its theatrical origins without actually feeling static or stagy. In fact, although the film reaches such pseudo-operatic heights in its drama, it's somewhat shocking that proceedings remain as relatively grounded as they do.The film is blessed with a top-notch cast, lead by the breathtakingly beautiful Paul Newman in a complex and thoroughly convincing portrayal of wounded masculinity. In a deeply internalized portrayal, Newman clearly conveys volumes of information with one glance of his steel-blue eyes. Taylor is unarguably at her sultriest as the frustrated Maggie, a definitive Williams' heroine, and her old-school Hollywood glamour contrasts perfectly with Newman's refined method acting. The supporting cast is flawless, lead by an outstanding, scene-stealing portrayal Burt Ives and featuring terrific turns by Jack Carson, Judith Anderson, and Madeleine Sherwood completing the impossibly tight ensemble.Although Tennessee Williams himself panned the film for censoring the more salacious elements of his original play, the film received largely positive reviews from most major critics and was later nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Audiences also responded, as the film grossed more that five times it's budget. It is crucial for a film adaptation of source material from any media to stand on its own, and the 1958 film version of CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF is an absolute classic by any measure.",

Being pretty faithful to the original this takes place only within a couple of room plus a small amount of exterior shooting but still hold the attention so well because of the wonderful dialogue and the performances. Burl Ives is as good as I have ever seen him and Paul Newman is great but it is Elizabeth Taylor that shines so brightly throughout. A little too brightly at times as to put some of the cast in the shade - a bit like Marilyn Monroe did on occasion. I purchased this on Blu-ray along with Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf and it occurs to me watching the Tennessee Williams that Edward Albee must have been influenced in the writing of his play after seeing this. The full horrors of the family history are gradually revealed with key moments prompting more revelations as we proceed, there is much emphasis on the leading lady having or not having a child and then there is the drinking. Both great pieces of writing from which two great films were made and so impressed was I with this that I wonder if 'Who's Afraid' will remain my favourite.",

            "content": "I tend to be a bit suspicious of pictures that came to our shores after a great deal of overseas pre-release ballyhoo. True, movies like \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" did take in a wonderful amount of money, but usually not enough to match their domestic gross or land them in our top twenty. Word-of-mouth usually turned against these movies too. Whilst they often chalked up respectable city seasons, they usually died in the suburbs and ended up playing to empty houses in rural areas. My latest estimate: Boring. A few sexual references may have titillated patrons in 1959, but they certainly don't keep this dreary, photographed-stage-play alive more than fifty years later. Despite sterling efforts by most of the players, \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" emerges as a dull, slow-moving picture, peopled with dull, painstakingly torpid caricatures mouthing dull, tediously uninteresting dialogue. We don't care a hoot why Newman isn't shacking up with Taylor. She's such a relentlessly brow-beating, yakkety-yakking shrew, we don't blame him for taking refuge in the bottle.The photographer tries hard to make Liz look glamorous, but he has his work cut out for him. Brooks' relentlessly routine direction with its monotonous parade of gormless close-ups doesn't help either. Nor do the very limited production values perk up any interest. Except for a few minutes of location filming, this picture is unadventurously tied to the Hollywood sound stage. The movie's theatre origins are also all too obvious. And then, to add insult to injury, what M-G-M has done is to take the guts right out of it. Symbolism is used with all the subtlety of a meat cleaver. Music is no asset either. The composer missed a grand opportunity to send the whole thing up by playing \"That Old Feeling\" under Taylor's constant whinges and \"Ida\" under Anderson's melodramatics.Finally, the ending. After Newman's endless talk of the sins of \"mendacity\" (don't worry, the word is defined for the benefit of those picturegoers who are not walking dictionaries), this ridiculous, negating-everything-that-has-gone-before-cop-out of a conclusion really puts the lid on this Cat.",

Even the smallest incident can cause the most sturdy amongst us to break. Man, the people we see here have some SERIOUS issues. There's Paul Newman, as a permanently soused retired sports star, who seems to not only have given up on his dreams, but his life too. Elizabeth Taylor his wife... she stays with him, tries to help him... even though he can't stand her. Why? An unfortunate incident involving Newman's best friend. You'll see.Also along for the ride are Newman's dad, a wealthy landowner who might have millions in cash but doesn't give a hoot about things like love. He appears to have a terminal illness, which inevitably causes friction between Newman and his brother... a decent sort of chap, but utterly dominated by his harridan of a missus, who seems to be bringing up the five most obnoxious children in existence (all used as parleying chips to get Big Daddy's land and money, of course). Actually, it would be more truthful to say it's Taylor who cares about the inheritance... Newman is content to just live out his days staring at the bottom of a bottle.As our troubled cast argue and bicker, coming to terms with the past and trying to see a brighter future, I was mesmerized by every aspect of this production. What seem to be quite simple individuals are quickly revealed to have many hidden depths, and it's this level of complexity which makes watching this so pleasurable. People CAN change and grow in the course of one evening, particularly if they're intelligent enough to talk it out like adults and see where they went wrong. There isn't a single wasted line of dialogue here or a scene that feels unnecessary. Paul Newman is outstanding, Elizabeth Taylor is luminous, and the rest embody their roles with the sort of professionalism you'd expect from a classic Silver Screen feature.

The storm taking place outside the mansion is nothing compared to the tension between all the family members gathering for the patriarch's birthday.As with another notable Tennessee Williams play -- \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" -- they had to remove the references to homosexuality to bring the movie to the silver screen. Still, the scenes of Maggie (Taylor) in her slip seem as though they would have been risqu\u00e9 for the time. Along with her, just about every character made me feel as if my throat was going to constrict. In a way, it's as if the only truly benign characters were the servants.All in all, I wouldn't call this movie a supreme masterpiece, but I found it to be worth seeing. This one, along with \"Streetcar\" and \"Baby Doll\" are the three great adaptations of Tennessee Williams plays. Also starring Paul Newman, Burl Ives, Judith Anderson (Mrs. Danvers in \"Rebecca\"), Jack Carson and Madeleine Sherwood (Reverend Mother on \"The Flying Nun\").*This is going to sound insane, but prior to \"COAHTR\", the only movie in which I'd seen Elizabeth Taylor was the god-awful \"Flintstones\" movie, in which she played Wilma's mother.",

As his health is worsening, family members gather like vultures at his birthday party. One of the two sons is Brick (Paul Newman), a troubled alcoholic with many issues. He has no interest in the family fortune but his wife Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) definitely does.The film is based on the play by Tennessee Williams. Due to production codes in the 1950s, important changes were made such as significantly reducing references to Brick's homosexuality.The last twenty minutes also seem too sentimental compared to the great drama that preceded it. Despite these flaws, this is a magnificent film.Aside from the avoidance of homosexuality (or at least diluting it), the movie is adept at other juicy issues: alcoholism, suicide, and \"marrying up\" into a wealthy family. It also seems to take open jabs at false concepts of 'family values'. Brick's brother (Jack Carson) and his wife (Madeleine Sherwood) have five bratty children against whom Big Daddy often shows contempt in hilarious ways.Director Richard Brooks does a fine job in keeping the movie always fascinating; it never feels constrained despite being based on a stage play. The jazzy score adds even more sizzle.Ultimately, it is the great acting that raises this film to such a high level. Newman and Taylor clearly show their legendary status individually and together as a couple in conflict - especially Newman as a very troubled soul. As the family matriarch, Judith Anderson seemed at first to be in a role that might be dismissed as a footnote. Yet, she has a few scenes near the end where she truly chews the scenery. Among all this greatness, Ives manages the difficult feat of being a true standout. His performance shows a full range and is truly exceptional. It's one of the best ever and one of the most under-rated.The film is also generally under-rated but hopefully, its status will improve in time. - dbamateurcriticOUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:1) Acting Ensemble\n2) Individual Performance by Burl Ives.",

            "content": "The Pollitt family gather to celebrate the 65th birthday of Big Daddy (Burl Ives), wealthy land owner and cotton merchant. Amongst the group are Big Daddy's wife, Ida, their eldest son, Gooper (Jack Carlson), Gooper's wife Mae (Madeline Sherwood) and their five children and the Pollitt's youngest and favourite son Brick (Paul Newman) and Brick's wife Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor).The movie opens with Brick, in a drunken stupor, attempting to recapture his lost glory days on the athletics track. Unfortunately, the only glory he gains is a broken ankle. Brick is a former star footballer who has become a miserable alcoholic. He spends his days in a deep depression, hobbling around on his crutch, grieving for the death of his best friend, Skipper, and yearning for the love of his father that he has never had. Brick is so wrapped up in feelings of disgust and sadness; he can't even bear to make love to his wife Maggie (whom he accuses of seducing and sleeping with Skipper). He lies on the couch swilling whiskey, nursing his broken ankle and wounded pride and rejecting Maggie's seductive advances as well as refusing to care about the family quarrelling downstairs.The story really heats up towards the middle of the film. As a thunderstorm erupts outside, the gloves come off. Determined to find out the cause of Brick's alcoholism, Big Daddy battles Maggie and Brick behind closed doors. Several revelations finally come to the surface. Brick's hatred of himself over losing his best friend and 'crutch', finally bring him out of his emotionless state as he starts to talk about the events leading up to Skipper's death. His deep blue eyes slowly well with tears and his grief-ravaged face crack through his father's harshness towards him. Big Daddy realises that his son's 'very close and almost obsessive' friendship with Skipper replaced the love that had been denied by his father for so long. During the heated arguing, Brick lets it slip that to Big Daddy that he has been lied to about his illness. Stunned with the revelation that he has terminal cancer and he has been lied to, Big Daddy wanders off to be alone.Brick searches for Big Daddy to apologise, and finds him in the basement, where they both have a deep and meaningful talk about their relationship. Father and son then realise how much they need each other. Brick doesn't care about wealth. All he wants is a father, not a boss. Both men are physically crippled \u0096 Brick with his broken ankle and Big Daddy with cancer. However, they become emotional crutches for each other, which in turn ease the physical pain. With a new found respect, understanding and love for each other, father and son help each other up the stairs to face the storm brewing in the living room between the remainder of the family. This particular scene is the strongest and most emotional in the entire movie.The family gather for a 'final confrontation' in the living room. It is uncovered that Gooper and Mae have drawn up papers to try and take Big Daddy's plantation from under him due to his terminal illness. With these revelations out in the open, Maggie cunningly takes the opportunity to give her 'birthday present' to Big Daddy. She announces that she is in fact pregnant with Brick's child. Of course Big Daddy knows that it is a lie. But he also knows now that Brick's demons have finally been laid to rest, and that his youngest son is ready to take on the responsibility of a family as well as the Pollitt property. He admires Brick for his simple want of love not money. Big Daddy then organises to have his lawyer leave his wealth to Brick.Paul Newman captures the intense depression of Brick really well. For the first half of the movie, he is emotionless, uncaring and wrapped up in his own world of pity and sadness. Elizabeth Taylor was perfect as the desperate and beautiful Maggie the Cat. She was courageous and powerful. Her performance perfectly bounced off Newman as he expressionlessly thwarted her advances. Both Newman and Taylor are so stunningly beautiful in this movie, that they take your breath away.Burl Ives was magnificent. What I loved most about Ives' performance, was Big Daddy's ability to be the domineering patriarch, but at the same time in his scenes with Brick, he allows himself to show that he understands his son's emotional pain, and in his facial expressions, you can see that he does hurt for the torment that Brick is going through. They are very subtle expressions of tenderness, but at the same time, they do make an impact on the viewer. Big Daddy's heart does truly break for his son, and it is clear that Brick is the favourite. Madeline Sherwood was impeccably cast as Gooper's annoying, greedy wife, Mae. Her whining, yelling and constant sneering at Brick and Maggie's infertile marriage is enough to make you wish Maggie actually did slap her into oblivion. The underrated Jack Carson is Gooper. Judith Anderson plays Big Mamma \u0096 the desperate, lonely and under-appreciated wife.Cat on a Hot Tin Roof takes us back to when the performances of actors were simply enough to draw audience. The story only revolve around family domestics, but it keeps the viewer interested and thoughtful until the final scene because of the pain, torment and greed of its characters. It was a pleasure to see such wonderful and talented performers at the top of their craft, and it is a terrific salute to the way dramatic film should be made.",

Nevertheless, the censorship does water down what is perhaps his most powerful play. A little known bit of trivia is that some of the casting goes against the images Williams had when he wrote the play. For example, in his own description of the characters, he refers to Big Daddy as \"tall and thin.\" This hardly fits Burl Ives, but then Ives played the part on Broadway, so Williams must have changed his mind, as well he should have, for Ives is superb. Similarly, Big Mama is described as short and stout and weighing about 170 pounds, and the play's dialogue has Big Daddy referring to her \"fat old body.\" This is deleted from the film because Big Mama is played by the tall and gaunt Judith Anderson. However, I imagine that Newman and Taylor are just about what Williams envisioned for Brick and Maggie. In fact, he should have been so lucky as to get Liz Taylor for the stage role.

The main reason for his disappointment (and many others', by the way), was the removal of all the direct references to homosexuality, that were too eminent in the original play.However, in my opinion, that did not diminish by any way this film, since it is obvious to anyone who watches it today that Brick HAD a very gay relationship with his \"mentor\" - even if that is never said on film. (Plenty of hints though, by both Maggie and Big Daddy, and not very subtle...)The cast members all delivered their roles superbly!!! I can only compare it with \"Who's Afraid of Vinginia Woolf\", in that aspect (and maybe with \"Doubt\".) A fellow IMDb user expressed that if it existed an Oscar for ensemble cast, this would have definitely won it. I totally agree with that. The actors' portrayals of Brick, Maggie, Mamma, Daddy etc all express and make us understand clearly the depths of each character, even if we don't necessarily agree with him/her.Even the most dislikeable one (sister-in-law) is not as two-dimensional as she appears to be. After all, she did follow her husbands' vain efforts to satisfy a man that actually detested them both. I surely don't justify or even like her, but I can clearly see why she feels she is entitled to the family property and goes ethically astray (and challenges every boundary of pettiness) to claim it. (However, you just can't have a movie without a villain...).Maggie's character of course (and rightfully) gains all our sympathy, due to her strong and more direct character - even if she did lie at the end in order to get her revenge! Williams, made that play in order to emphasize the consequences from lying and that's why the film ends with amending that lie... Minor spoiler: A subtle hint in the film is that Brick's brother used to come to him to help him to face Big Daddy and Brick (despite not liking him either) did it. That's why he obviously believes him and second him and disses his wife instead of him near the end. It's not so subtle that Big Daddy \"trapped\" Brick's brother in doing what he was being told - in order to accept him, while he would like him and respected him more ONLY if he directly stood up to him. He seems to some missed that point or simply gave up long ago...Maybe I am a romantic, but I appreciated that the film ends the way it does. Partly because at the end of many films based on Williams' plays, I was educated, but very saddened. So, I was afraid that would be the case also. Thankfully I was not.Want to See why?

            "content": "In 1958 Hollywood censorship restrictions were still sufficiently all-pervasive to necessitate a toning-down of Tennessee Williams's CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF (1955). Most of the homosexual themes were removed, and the third act revised to include a lengthy scene of reconciliation between Brick (Paul Newman) and Big Daddy (Burl Ives). Williams so disliked the toned-down film adaptation of his play that he told people in the queue, \"This movie will set the industry back 50 years. Go home!\"Despite the author's misgivings, the homosexual element is still very much evident in Richard Brooks's and James Poe's screenplay. Brick is full of self-loathing in the belief that he has contributed to his close friend Skipper's death, and cannot stand Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) to be anywhere near him. While the film shows Brick and Maggie coming together at the end in sexual congress, we still doubt whether it will be a success in light of Brick's previous behavior. The film talks of a \"close friendship\" between himself and Brick in such open terms that we cannot help but doubt that there was a sexual element to it.Even if we accept that the film slightly bowdlerizes the source- text, we are left with a work that hits viewers with the emotional kick of a mule. Shot in garish color that brings out the sheer awfulness of the celebrations mounted for Big Daddy's birthday by Sister Woman (Madeleine Sherwood) and her overfed offspring, the film emphasizes just how much \"mendacity\" - or the perpetual telling of lies - has destroyed this family. The action unfolds in a series of powerful scenes involving one or two characters - Maggie and Brick, Big Daddy and Brick - where they quite literally tear the emotional heart out of one another. Brooks favors long takes interspersed with frequent close-ups portraying the mental as well as physical strain the characters undergo.Yet perhaps this is inevitable in a traditional Southern world where child-rearing is accepted as inevitable and love takes second place to power. Gooper (Jack Carson) is a successful lawyer, giving him the (totally unwarranted) belief that he has an automatic right to inherit Big Daddy's estate when Big Daddy passes. In his slate-gray suit and slicked-back hair, he looks every inch the efficient executive as opposed to the slatternly Brick, who spends much of the first of the film in his pajamas, with a crutch to help him move around.Big Momma (Judith Anderson), although sympathetic towards Brick, encourages such beliefs with her relentless quizzing of Maggie as to why Maggie has not yet produced a child. In light of such pressures, it's hardly surprising that Brick should have begun a homosexual relationship as a means of escape, an alternative form of love based on passion rather than duty.Newman and Taylor's exchanges are memorable; two actors at the cusp of mega-stardom taking advantages of Williams's brilliant writing to portray two characters victimized by their surroundings. It's not their fault that they cannot consummate their relationship: circumstances dictated their destiny. As Big Daddy, Ives is both imperious yet vulnerable, his body quite literally succumbing to cancer, even though is mind remains dominant.Stylistically speaking this version of CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF might appear somewhat theatrical, with its claustrophobic-like settings and long takes. Yet it retains the capacity to shock viewers with its stark rawness, even though it is nearly six decades since its original release.",

            "content": "Damn the Hays Code, Tennessee Williams' Pulitzer-winning play is bowdlerized on its way from Broadway to the silver screen, where all its homosexual reference is tactlessly papered over. That said, riding on the strength of its top-line ensemble cast, Richard Brook's exquisite film adaptation still dazzles and hurtles upon a Southern family's trouble waters.The crises of the Pollitt family, an affluent rags-to-riches Mississippi empire of cotton plantation built by the patriarch Harvey aka. Big Daddy (Ives, reprises his role from the stage), are multifarious: his youngest son Brick (Newman), a former athlete who abuses himself with alcohol and despondency in the wake of the suicide of his best friend Skipper, and doesn't want to have any physical intimacy with his sultry wife Maggie (Taylor); then their is the ominous dread of Big Daddy's doom, who is diagnosed with terminal cancer and has less than one year to live, but Dr. Baugh (Gates) fabricates a lie to appease him and his wife Ida aka. Big Mamma (Anderson), only the cat will finally get out of the bag, and its theme of dual courage (for Brick to face life and for Big Daddy, death) plays out with elemental emotional upheaval on the eve of Big Daddy's 65-year-old birthday, which occupies 99% of the time-frame and takes place entirely in their sumptuous family manor.The nexus here is the raison d'\u00eatre behind Brick's indifferent attitude and self-abandoning intemperance that puts himself against everyone else, since homosexuality is off the table, Brooks and James Poe's script has to scrape the bottom of the barrel and leaves it mostly to the rage of being (presumably) two-timed, when that proves to be not the case, the barrier causes Brick's connubial inaction naturally vanishes, ergo, that inconsolable guilt and grieve derived from losing a loved one in Williams' original play is pitifully deadened to conceive a perfectly heteronormative ending, with a dated, self-congratulatory whiff of natalism (especially grating after hammering home what kerfuffle a band of bratty, insolent kids can engender).Doused in booze and whose mobility is impeded by a crutch, Newman is magnificent and passionately engaged from A to Z and rightfully receives his first Oscar nomination for a very difficult and complex role. Underneath his Adonis appearance, Newman unleashes Brick's harrowing obduracy to the hilt, he is self-centered enough to submerge himself entirely in his existential cynicism and doesn't give a damn about the whole world after what he suffers, not even his father's death knell, but deep down, he is merely a love-wanting child borne out of a poor rich boy's misery and destructively waging war on the mendacity of the world, a tour de force loaded with fiery explosion.An Oscar-nominated Taylor, adorned only by two pieces of finery and a pearl choker, also utterly takes our breath away with her ineffable beauty, a refined southern belle locution and superbly lived-in performance, whenever she and Newman are on screen together, they are the perfect specimen of what divine human gorgeousness looks like, for that reason alone, the film should be included in any film buff's must-see list. Her Maggie is a valiant fighter, a can-doer, a go-getter, and her allure is fiendishly underlined by the presence of her super-fertile sister-in-law Mae (a plain-looking Sherwood), the wife of Brick's elder brother Cooper (Carson, walking a fine line between grasping and subservient), fanatically battling a losing game to earn affection from Big Daddy with all her pesky tailed assets, Williams' misogynistic partiality is quite revealing.Performance extraordinaire suffuses the rest of the ensemble, in the co-leading role, Burl Ives' larger-than-life bravura as Big Daddy is equally impressive, delivering Williams' florid texts with resounding decibel, and brings about incredible gravitas and compassion in the third act when reconciliation shapes up during a barnstorming t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate between a befogging father and his prodigal son. Then there is the ever-forbidding Anderson, refuses to give Big Mamma a simple caricatural veneer, and finds her disparaged yet supportive wife a strong purchase in the catharsis-inspiring drama that is worthy of Williams' name, regardless of the compromises inflicted by an odious force majeure.",

Life is cold, bitter, with a detestable but somewhat invigorating taste, and it sounds like a pianistic jazzy score : entertaining when your eyes are closed but soulless when the windows of your heart are...Sincerely, I could have turned off the film just because I couldn't buy the idea of a man refusing to have sex with such a babe like Maggie the Cat, Elizabeth Taylor at the Everest of her beauty, even if this guy is the male-crush inducing Paul Newman, as Brick Politt. I guess movies ought to challenge our perceptions. Maggie even wishes Brick was ugly so she could at least console herself, but she loves Brick, and can't get him off her mind. They're married, but he hasn't touched her since a tragic event made her undesirable. Hard to believe, isn't it? Who can even describe Elizabeth Taylor with that epithet? But that's the point, when you realize how lying can be so convenient : let's say that Brick didn't desire Maggie \u0085 it might, it just might \u0085 but isn't it too cinematically convenient? Isn't there another hidden painful truth that could make it more acceptable? Richard Brooks' adaption of Tennessee Williams' play \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" is a sensational immersion into the terrible condition to which life condemns us : a big and great lie. Who are we? People seeking happiness sure, but happiness implies some ounces of interest, we can't be happy without 'getting' something.

There's no room for abstractions in these Southern bourgeois cultures, the illusion of happiness and comfort are even more important that genuine happiness. So all we need is contenting ourselves with impressions, Maggie is pretty, Brick is good-looking, they form a great couple, and that's that \u0085But something obviously tortures Brick, at a point the movie entered pop-culture with this iconic ambiguity. The taboo subject is the death of his friend Skipper, whom he always relied on, whether it was on a football field or in real-life, there was a symbiotic relationship as if Skipper was a continuation of Brick, his crutch. Both Brick and Maggie's defensive reactions at the mention of 'Skipper' emphasize the idea of something more than a simple friendship. Well, we all know what it is all about, homosexuality is a recurring theme in Tennessee Williams' plays, less as a voyeuristic plot device than a denunciation of the hypocrisy governing our societies. Mendacity is the word often used, I prefer to call it \"convenient lies\", this sort of denial that maintains good relations to better destroy them in the longer them. Lies like a psychological blindfold we use to hide the true ugliness of things ... but isn't a genuine and sincere ugliness more tolerable than any convenient but hypocritical beauty ?The subplot involving the illness of Brick's father, highlights our inner fear of the truth. Hasn't it happened to you that you were so afraid of facing a situation you knew to be imminent to postpone it as long as you could ? Like a nihilistic approach to whatever could ruin your happiness. Big Daddy, in a fantastic performance by Burl Ives, feels like resurrecting after having been announced that he would survive from his cancer, and at that point, acts as if whatever he built and gathered didn't mean anything, all that mattered was living, loving, getting a pretty girl etc. There's a feeling of urge as if life was about fulfilling our dreams the fastest way ... but, when after a crucial discussion with his son, Big Daddy realized that he was indeed condemned, he went back to the idea that his son should behave better in order to earn the estate. This precious estate cherished by his other son, Gooper, played by Jack Carson and his wife Mae, Madeline Sherwood. But life isn't about stuff you own, nor love is about giving stuff, life is about immeasurable things : the stuff you have but can't get. The film covers many taboo subjects, including sex before marriage, homosexuality, but the revolutionary aspect relies on the thought-provoking way it tackles the value of life through a character dying, and another, trying to hide his true personality. Hiding, lying, imitating, all these conveniences allow us to give a meaning to our lives, while our weaknesses, our secrets, our hidden desires, are the most solid constituents of our inner personalities. We are what we try to hide, and the price for happiness is the reconciliation between us and the disturbing truths that constitute our lives. As soon as Big Daddy resign himself to the idea of dying, he get truer to himself. When Brick admits his guilt in the death of his best friend Skipper, the relief in his heart made him more conscious of the fragility, then the value of his existence. Facing and overcoming lies are the only ways to get closer to the inner truth. It's ironic how the movie ends with a big lie, but a sincere lie as it revealed something true boiling in the body of Maggie, and able to appease all the consciences of the Pollitts's family, like a sort of Deus ex Machina that could finally let this tormented a family feel better ... finally ...",

            "content": "\"Brick Pollitt\" (Paul Newman) is a former athlete who has an extremely wealthy father known as \"Big Daddy\" (Burl Ives) and a beautiful wife named \"Maggie\" (Elizabeth Taylor). Unfortunately, although an injury sustained while playing football has destroyed his athletic career, it's another situation (which only he knows) that results in him becoming angry and bitter at everybody in his life. This not only includes Big Daddy--who finds fault with everyone around him--but also Maggie who does everything she can to remedy the situation with Brick only to see her romantic advances thrown back in her face. Naturally, this has left her both sexually frustrated and even more importantly--childless. Yet, with all of this going on, when he hears rumors that his father is extremely sick, both he and Maggie decide to visit Big Daddy upon his release from the hospital and--coincidentally enough--his 65th birthday as well. However, what nobody counts on is the dramatic turn of events that follow which shatters the family dynamic in a most dramatic manner. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an impressive film which benefited greatly from the fine acting of Burl Ives, Paul Newman and especially Elizabeth Taylor who eluded beauty and sexuality from start-to-finish. That said, however, this film featured no action, very little humor and was quite wordy. Yet even so, I found it to be it rather entertaining despite these weaknesses and I have rated it accordingly.

            "content": "Nobody seems quite at his or her best here -- not the writer, the director, or the performers. It's not a terrible movie but it does have its weaknesses.Burl Ives is Big Daddy, a blustering, no-nonsense, fustian plantation owner who carved his empire out of a swamp. Nobody says anything to him without prefacing the statement with, \"Big Daddy,\" as if to get his attention. Paul Newman and wife Maggie, Elizabeth Taylor, are visiting the Big House to celebrate Big Daddy's birthday along with his return from the clinic, where he, Big Daddy, that is, has been told his pain is caused only by a spastic colon when in fact it's terminal cancer. Also in attendance at the festivities are Big Daddy's wife, Agnes Moorehead, whom he has never loved, and Big Daddy's other son, Jack Carson, who is sniffing after all of Big Daddy's money.The structure of the play is irritating. Look at Tennessee William's best work, \"A Streetcar Named Desire.\" It's a near-perfect tragedy that builds in momentum. (The movie throws away the original ending.) There is no climactic surprise, no big secret exposed. It's a story of love, conflict, and collapse. And \"Suddenly Last Summer,\" which builds to one Big Reveal. \"Cat On A Hot Tin Roof\" has multiple Reveals, all arranged nicely in sequence, preceded by argument and concluded in shock. It doesn't work as well.Want some of the Reveals? Look out, they're spoilers. Liz Taylor blames herself for the death of Newman's best friend or, should we say, best \"friend\"? Next, after much coaxing, Newman admits that he drinks because HE blames himself for Skipper's death. Next, Newman finds out that Big Daddy's illness is terminal. Next, Maggie finds out. Next, Big Daddy finds out. Next, Big Daddy's wife. And so on -- all these mini-climaxes about equidistant from one another. \"Suddenly Last Summer\" built to one horrifying scene in which a secret is revealed. It was far more successful.There is an abundance of shouting. Hardly anyone speaks in a normal tone of voice. The viewer hardly has time to draw a breath. Newman puts away enough booze in the first ten minutes to floor a rhinoceros. Williams gets hung up on the word \"mendacity.\" \"There is the smell of mendacity in this room!\" yells Burl Ives. Of course, in reality, social life is a tissue of lies. (Try it next time someone greets you with, \"How are you?\") But I'm grateful for the constant references to \"mendacity.\" It's almost amusing. And it does provide about the only theme that organizes this whirligig of a story.Newman hadn't yet got his acting chops. He's sullen and wooden throughout. Man, was he to evolve -- beginning with \"The Hustler\" a few years later. Taylor is at least competent and her numinous beauty is stunning too. Whatever appeal Burl Ives had has always eluded me but he's at least as good here as the overbearing pater familias as he's been anywhere else. Jack Carson gives no evidence of being a dramatic actor, but then the script renders him thoroughly obnoxious. He has a terrible habit. Lyndon B. Johnson had the same problem. Carson is tall and when he's speaking to someone shorter he has a tendency to lean sideways and thrust his face upwards into the listener's. His wife is a stereotype. Their five children should be stomped on like roaches. Agnes Moorehead's role, though not central, may be the most pathetic in the film -- a woman who loves her husband but has no idea he doesn't give a damn about her.Some of the issues are pretty dated too, though that doesn't necessarily deprive them of impact. Doctors don't keep the truth from their patients anymore. And when Big Daddy asks Maggie, \"Let me put it this way -- do you make him happy?\", and Maggie answers, \"Why don't you ask if he keeps ME happy?\", it's all code for something else that couldn't be openly asked in the 1950s.All that hysterical running around and bellowing turned my colon spastic. It only settled down for a few minutes when Liz Taylor was prowling around the bedroom wearing only a slip.",

And she gives a great performance in the film, adding to the terrific ensemble cast (Newman, Ives, Carson, Anderson, Sherwood) in this near-2- hourlong argument that feels just like you're watching a stageplay. The dialogue bristles and keeps your attention rapt even as you pray for these people to stop punishing each other. Not I've wanted to punch someone so badly as I did sister Mae and her no-neck heathens. At the very least, the incorrigible Newman came to his damn senses and learned to love Taylor again. But it's Burl Ives performance that steals the show. Easy. The guy had heart, and lent depth to that character. Really a great performance. It's a bit of a rough movie, flared tempers and voices always shouting. It's like one of those really awful family reunions (with death hanging in the air, to boot) you have to sit through. But there's a catharsis at the end of this hard-fought skirmish, and the movie's all the more rewarding for it. Great movie.8/10",

            "content": "Spoilers herein.How strange to see this film again. I did so after seeing Paul Newman in `Perdition,' and was reminded of how solidly in control he is.But not in this mess.Tennesse Williams was a brilliant writer, who used pain to evoke a mood and then create an unreal world. He steered clear of moralizing and happy endings, on both of which this film depends. He portrayed Brick as a raunchy, dumb bisexual jock now impotent with his sexy, trashy wife rather than the simple angry fellow who rejects sex that we have here. Gooper was fathered by an unknown. Big Momma was mentally ill, that sort of terminal repression you only found in the South. The plantation was run essentially on slave labor in a heartless manner. The play was gutted and Williams loudly objected.Newman also disavowed it later in life after he learned how to really act. Elizabeth Taylor is a joke -- her readings are so stagy, none of the passion and confused sexual energy of the part conveys. At no moment do we feel that she would literally kill for a son, and perhaps has. (But Burl Ives is amazing, tromping all over the material he knew from the stage.)To understand how great the failure, one has to consider Brando's `Streetcar' of a few years earlier. True to the play, not only to the material itself, but the philosophy of conveying that material. Brando reinvented acting, period. That revolution hasn't caught this cast. The power isn't there at all.In fact, this film is to `Streetcar' as the prancing of the noneck monsters is to the Pollit family. Think of the leads if they were played by Sean Penn and Julianne Moore or Cate Blanchett.In an amazing element of self-reference, Newman was already a serious drunk when this was made and remained so until his son died in the 80s. Then he developed the real power he has today.",

Imagine all the events take place in one day. Dame Elizabeth Taylor and Dame Judith Anderson playing southern wives and belles but they're not weak just desperate. Madeleine Sherwood deserved a Best SUpporting Actress nomination for her performance. I think she proved that she can handle the heat in the kitchen with those dames and of course, Paul Newman and Burl Ives. I felt sorry for this family who had lived the American dream. It's quite a tragedy. Brick and Maggie are trapped in a marriage which make neither one of them happy. HIs brother Goober and his wife, Mae, have provided plenty of heirs for the family fortune to a grandfather who does everything to avoid the children or Maggie puts it \"little monsters.\" I kind of felt sorry for Goober and Mae being treated like second class citizens for the favorite, Brick and Maggie. Of course, Mae isn't attractive but she breeds like a rabbit. Goober went to law school and has done everything to please his father, Big Daddy, but nothing does. Even his wife, Big Mama is trapped in a marriage. Nobody is really happy here. The casting of Larry Gates and Madeleine Sherwood is excellent and all the actors do a fantastic job especially creating SOuthern accents like Dame Judith and Dame Liz. I don't think you can remake this film to create the kind of magic and chemistry that this cast has already established. Burl Ives gives the best performance of the bunch here. It really is his movie. He created the role of Big Daddy on Broadway before bringing it to film. This is his WIlly Loman role that Lee J. Cobb made famous. I wouldn't want to see a live stage production after this of this play. This film is colorful, brilliant, tragic, and yet so human the entire time.",

The intensity is felt from the beginning to the end of the movie and the ending brilliant releases the pressure and brings triumph and a big smile to your face. Several sub plots wind and twist throughout the movie and become unraveled so well as the primary storyline unfolds.

The interactions between the gifted actors and actresses were stupendous. I really felt for Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) \"The Cat \", though and how she was able to keep her composure with her husband Brick Pollitt's (Paul Newman) berating of her. We learn that he was a drunk trying to recapture his glory days of high school sports by leaping hurdles on a track field, dreaming about his moments as a youthful athlete, but suddenly he falls and breaks his leg, leaving him dependent on a crutch. During the film, he has some harsh words for Maggie. I felt that her character was treated unfairly by Brick and to make matters worse, his father Big Daddy (Burl Ives), shows nothing, but contempt for his son that he's even violent towards him. I really understood why he was so angry with Brick and as you watch the verbal fight between the two, you really side with Big Daddy. Newman really was a great actor and was the best choice for this part. Taylor, on the other hand, is a big star And she played Maggie to a T! I really think the Hollywood scripts these days are dead weight compared to the 50s and 60s! The exchanges of dialog and the acting were definitely marvelous.

Therefore, I believe that expectations for the film were high, when it opened, for the Anglophone audience. For me, who do not know the work of Williams, it is different: I cannot compare the film with a book I have never read or a play I have never seen.The script focuses on a birthday party at the southern plantation of Big Daddy. The party brings the whole family together because it is known that he will die soon, but that is something that everyone decided to hide from him. He has two children: Gooper, the youngest son, has always done everything his father wanted, married a self-interested woman and has a collection of annoying children; on the other hand, Brick is the opposite, having never had an easy relationship with his father. Alcoholic due to a past hurt and a failed sports career, he married the beautiful Maggie \"the Cat\", whom no one in the house seems to like. When Big Daddy returns from the hospital, convinced that he is in good health, he takes the opportunity to say a lot of what he always thought to each one of those present. This will be the catalyst for many family secrets to be revealed or unearthed.I found the film quite interesting because of the way it plays with a trivial family moment - a birthday party - to create a real family drama. I don't need to read Williams' book to believe that the film was faithful to him: even without having done so, I give credit to the screenwriter's work, even though I know that certain aspects, such as allusions to homosexuality, have been greatly diminished. However, I did not understand why Maggie is called (or calls herself) \"Cat\", even though I understand that she does not feel desired by her husband.The film has a luxurious and notable cast, which does very well both for the effort and the quality of its dialogues. Burl Ives is noteworthy for the effort with which he embodies his character, but Paul Newman is not far behind and is excellent in the way he gives Brick more pain, more psychological intensity than one might expect. Elizabeth Taylor, alongside her, obtains with this film one of the most iconic interpretations of her career, although the character is quite secondary in the story told. She can make Maggie a pleasant character, who is deeply interested, but she can be human and have a big heart too. She establishes a collaboration and chemistry with Newman that is admirable. Jack Carson and Madeleine Sherwood are quite competent in their roles.Technically, it is a very restrained film, leaving the actors' interpretation to speak for itself. Cinematography is extraordinarily beautiful for a film so many years old, the colors are vivid and the light was very well-used, like rain and night, with a storm outside to accompany the storm that unfolded inside. The costumes and sets are very good, the house looks a lot like the plantation of Twelve Oakes, from \"Gone With The Wind\". The soundtrack fulfills its role.",

What is interesting is that, although due to censors they all but cut the gay out of the original screenplay, the rest of the piece is actually more honest than anything that has come out of Hollywood in the past three decades or so. For example, there is one scene where the patriarch, played brilliantly by Burl Ives, launches into a tirade that includes \"life is work, sweat, pain and paying bills, life is making love to a woman who you don't love, and they don't print your name in the paper until you die\". ..\nWow!. Incredibly frank for 1958, and it would never be uttered today.

Jack Carson is the weak, obedient and slightly less believable elder brother, whilst Madeleine Sherwood plays the in-law from hell.For just over 100mins, these stricken characters hold the viewers' attention rigid as the deep-seated psychological and emotional issues that have brought there relationships to such a pass are gradually laid bare. Every second of conflict is a micro-drama in itself. Towards the end, I found all the reconciliating a reconciliation too far. I've never seen anything worked out quite so completely in real life. Yet it provides a comfortable conclusion and the cast still endue them with a sense of fidelity.If anybody wonders why I no longer bother with most modern movies and their two-dimensional acting in 3D, propped-up by a shed-load of boring pyrotechnics and seen-them-all-before special effects.

Colours are still vibrant, sets on the money, no technical issue gave the game away.I'll back one hour of this against ten hours of Hobbits, Dark Knights or whatever other fantastical tosh any time.

Whilst it has definitely been sanitized and diluted by Hollywood an even greater sin is the fact that not one single frame tells us we are in the Deep South and for all the authenticity on display we could just as well be in Bangor, Maine, or Kokomo, Indiana. Writer-director Richard Brooks must be a graduate student of irony: before he began directing films Brooks wrote a couple of fine novels, one of which, The Brick Foxhole, was adapted for the screen and, with a new title, Crossfire, was directed powerfully in 1948 by Edward Dymytryk. Brooks wrote a novel about how hate can lead to murder, a homosexual is killed just for being a member of a minority group. In 1948 Hollywood no one was about to put a gay man on screen so the victim became Jewish, another minority group. Ten years later Brooks was STILL not allowed to touch on the possible homosexuality of one of the three leading characters, Brick Pollitt, played by Paul Newman, meaning other reasons had to be fashioned for his alcoholism and aversion to having sex with his wife, Maggie the Cat, played by Elizabeth Taylor. The third lead was Big Daddy Pollitt, played by Burl Ives, whose terminal cancer was a handing metaphor for the 'decaying Magnolia' school of writing to which it belongs.

I am not sure how I feel about them expanding Big Daddy's role, either. Burl Ives is incredible, though, so I suppose that is no terrible decision.Paul Newman also excels, but when does he not? Despite being a character that is hard to love, he makes himself easy to understand and adds personality to alcoholism. Elizabeth Taylor, whom I have never been a fan of, does a fine job as Maggie the Cat. This certainly must be considered one of her career highlights.",

            "content": "Many comment on the great acting in this picture, and they are correct. However, there was one major flaw.Both Newman and Taylor have pronounced Southern accents in their opening scene together. They both lose this accent about a third of the way through. I've always considered that to be failure in an actor: not to make a firm decision on an accent and stick to it. Tom Hanks did this in \"Volunteers\", dropped his 'Boston Braham' accent shortly after the picture started. Newman and Taylor should've kept their normal voice. Ives did it and it didn't hurt his performance at all.It's hard to believe that the young Newman and Taylor, at that time probably the two most beautiful people on the planet, weren't banging each others bones. Between youth, beauty and proximity nature takes its course.Williams made his point about mendacity fairly early, so much so that it started to get on my nerves. Cut 15 minutes of mendacity from the picture, please.The acting was excellent and well directed. The second half of the picture is stronger than the first, perhaps because there is more clarity in the second half. The first half you're always trying to figure out who is honest when; and what their agenda is. That 'mendacity' thing again.A good picture worth seeing.",

            "content": "A classic film in terms of star power, and the flawless craft that went into it, but nowhere near as shocking, poetic or memorable as the earlier B&W Tennessee Williams adaptation A Streetcar Named Desire.Essentially, this film is a glitzy, upmarket rewriting of that films central themes and tropes, except focusing on a genteel family of well-to-do Americans; their family headed by a plutocrat of sorts, diagnosed with cancer, with his family of dysfunctional, permanently arguing offspring and in-laws bitching at each other over who will get his house, land and business interests after death.The film does achieve a kind of black comic tone during numerous scenes where Big Daddy essentially thinks his health is fine, but doesn't know the real diagnosis, and of course Elizabeth Taylor looks stunning, always lit and dressed perfectly, and occasionally shot with a soft focus lens that would look out of place nowadays, but isn't as disjunctive as the overcooked soft focus you'd see on, say, an early Star Trek episode.This movie is OVERRATED. I don't mean that in a bad way, the writing is great, the characterization and catharsis among the troubled offspring verges on a type of pop-psychoanalysis. The movies main problem is that is makes very heavy going of 'taboo' subjects like sex, alcoholism and repressed familial hatreds, that supposedly decent people \"just didn't talk about\" in the 1950s. The actors often seem to be shouting their emotions at the audience, not at each other, and the sheer volume of endless arguing and accusations among the hateful, greedy family members feels like an endless fever pitch where the director wants a big emotional forte every five minutes, practically like clockwork.As I mentioned above, the films essentially a recasting of Streetcar, but in a different setting, and numerous commentaries suggesting that Williams own dysfunctional, miserable family are projected in his writing work are quite obvious. Ultimately, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is a good movie, but only if you haven't seen the earlier (and better) movie A Streetcar Named Desire. Lastly, the tone and personal drama approach of the film seems to have hit a commercial formula for popular drama that gets re-written and replayed practically every year, showered with awards no doubt, as pretend family members shout, emote and deliver extensive monologues baring witness to their inner lives, in a very, very direct and obvious manner. Good entertainment, but a bit middlebrow, too.",

There is no mistaking the actors, the really drop dead gorgeous Paul Newman, the Beautiful Elizabeth Taylor, the Big Fluffy of a Bear Daddy Burl Ives...that makes one WANT to look at this film and makes one WANT to get it but...I didn't get it.First I thought it was because I was young when I watched this alot..Then, I saw it several times when I was a teen a young adult and as an adult.

Maybe its because the way the characters are drawn from the South..maybe there's so much going around that I just don't care after a while..but I do enjoy looking at lotsa Newman, Taylor and the fashion (especially in that white dress!!!) and the drawl and 'manishness' of Burl Ives. The rest of the cast is equally as good..giving me the creeps about Southern folks. If that's \"it\"..then again, I find the film..okay.. But the way everyone describes it..seeing that it is a Pulitzer Prize Winning Play from the great Tennesee Williams, I feel like I am missing something great in film...and I feel I'm usually good at spotting it but..I just didn't get it.But its a must see for the Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor fans.

            "content": "CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF is the 1958 film version of Tennessee Williams' classic Broadway play, that is still powerful entertainment despite a typically watered down screenplay. The story follows the Pollitt family, headed by Big Daddy, who has just returned to his southern plantation after an extended hospital stay in time for his 60th birthday party where his family will gather and long hidden resentments, greed, machinations, manipulations, and, of course, secrets will rear their ugly head. Big Daddy has two sons: Gooper is a brown-nosing, if well-intentioned moron who desperately seeks his father's approval so he can inherit the estate someday and bows to his father's every demand and keeps Big Daddy awash in grandchildren. Despite all his good intentions, Big Daddy can't stand Gooper or his grasping and perpetually pregnant wife or his obnoxious children. Gooper's brother Brick is an alcoholic loser who has arrived at the plantation for the birthday party, but has injured his leg trying to relive his youth as a track star and lays up in his bedroom drinking and ignoring his beautiful wife Maggie, who Big Daddy adores and continues to pressure for grandchildren, but Maggie can't get Brick to touch her since the death of his college buddy, Skipper. Williams' play makes no bones about the fact that Brick and Skipper were lovers, but all references to homosexuality were dropped in the screenplay, making much of Brick's motivations for distancing himself from Maggie unclear, but making the film suitable for 1958 film audiences. Despite the watered down screenplay, the film is still an emotionally-charged experience thanks to the taut direction of Richard Brooks and sterling performances from an all-star cast. Paul Newman has rarely been better as the tortured Brick and Elizabeth Taylor is a revelation as sexual dynamo Maggie the Cat. During production, Taylor lost third hubby Mike Todd in a plane crash and Taylor apparently channeled her grief into her work, producing one of her finest performances. She and Newman both received richly deserved Oscar nominations. Newman should have won. Burl Ives is brilliant as Big Daddy. Ives ironically won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for that year, but for another film (THE BIG COUNTRY). Jack Carson also gave one of his strongest performances as Gooper as did Madeline Sherwood, playing his obnoxious wife, Mae. Judith Anderson is heartbreaking as Big Mama and Larry Gates has his moments as Big Daddy's doctor, who is forced to reveal that Big Daddy is dying. Though slightly diluted from its original source, still a powerful movie experience that merits multiple viewings. Don't miss this one.",

            "content": "A memorable drama, with superb performances by Elizabeth Taylor, Paul Newman, and Burl Ives. The undercurrent of Taylor and Newman's wrecked marriage energizes the plot; they \"occupy the same cage\" as Taylor's Maggie puts it. She relentlessly tries seduction, but Newman could care less.As others have pointed out, Brick's brother is presented as a hen-pecked mediocrity, his family fairly trashy, while Brick and Maggie are the 'cool couple.' Actually, Gooper is a solid citizen, and Brick is a bitter alcoholic. It's amusing how Ives' Big Daddy shows no respect for Gooper's family, dropping sarcastic bombs all over them. Nonetheless, he's even more upset by Brick's non-conformity.It would be interesting to have a sort of prequel in which Brick's relationship with Skipper is shown, instead of just referred to. That would've been impossible in the 50s. In fact, it's surprising that the gay theme was explored in such depth, even if inferentially. Big Daddy is consumed by Brick's inclination; he can't understand it, for him it's a problem that should have a solution.Still, he shows considerable sensitivity to Brick. He never insults Brick, as he does everyone else, Maggie excepted. \"We even love your hate\" as Big Momma aptly puts it. He goes through a huge effort to shoo everyone away when he wants to talk to Brick. \"Now that I'm straightened out, I'm gonna straighten you out!\" Big Daddy tells him. Brick's alcoholism is the buffer between the way he is, and the way he's expected to be.The thunderstorm breaks, literally, just as they bring up Skipper. While Skipper was losing control, just before his suicide, Maggie wanted to go bed with him in an ironic attempt to keep him away from Brick by trying to 'fix' him. Interestingly, Big Daddy shows concern for Skipper, realizing that Brick is partially responsible for Skipper's death. Big Daddy has sensitivity, but lacks love.After Big Daddy discovers that he will die, the family argument over the estate rivals Brick and Bid Daddy's earlier argument for its intensity. It succeeds in pointing out Gooper's greed and shallowness. The climactic cellar scene telescopes the show's themes adroitly; Brick and Big Daddy finally do understand each other, and each other's strengths and weaknesses. The last scene, however, seems artificial, as though Brick can change his nature through an act of will.Cat On a Hot Tin Roof is an excellent movie, very passionate and very intelligent. 9/10.",

            "review_title": "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof - A Thrilling Drama",
            "content": "Cat On A Hot Tin Roof, unlike what the title suggests, is as dark, depressing, profound, layered and pervasive as any drama film can ever be, aptly shot within a limited perimeter with a handful of characters. It raises as many questions about life and people in general as it answers about the mysteries of the plot which is the foremost reason why this movie will never lose its relevance even though few of its ingredients are past their expiry dates.The movie doesn't take too much time to draw the viewer in, thanks to a fabulously shot long opening scene which has at display the acting prowess of Newman and Taylor along with a continuous piano instrumental in the background which makes the conversation all the more interesting and intriguing. The tonality of Taylor's dialogue delivery and the pauses she takes are so typical of those times and are yet so charming that they can make you fall in love with her. She is arguably the most charming diva of the 20th century, yet it is never difficult to imagine her portraying a character which is most of the times transmitting negative vibes. She has a special gift, with a little change in her glance and a minor change in her eye liner, she can create a different version of herself. In fact, as the movie reaches its culmination one begins to realize that the part of Maggie is so carefully constructed that the option to not like her has been completely left to the audience ,of course at their own risk!Brick, an alcoholic ex-footballer is played by Newman, who pulls it off without any crutches. He is playing a man who is a fighter, yet hell bent on losing the battle, is an optimist at heart but decides to traverse the path of indifference. I do not know whether it is Brooks' style or Newman's improvisation, there are scenes where Brick would enquire further to a statement made by Maggie by asking 'Is it Maggie?'. The tone of this query borders between sarcasm and apathy and that just takes the scene to another level altogether.Being an adaptation to a stage play,COAHTR has done fair justice to it by being a compilation of long sequences(not long shots, that would have been epic!) which are shot within a house. Also, it is quite evident that while adapting the play into a feature film, Brooks had chosen not to include certain direct references taking into consideration sensitivities of 50's audience and censor which actually has worked in favour of the movie by making it even more interpretive in nature at certain critical junctures. There are two philosophical questions pertaining to morality and death which are at stake in the movie. The manner in which focus shifts from one to another is much like how a stage play would be divided in two halves.Unlike conventional cinema where a character develops as the story progresses, here the circumstances and their portrayal is such that the major characters indulge in the discussions pertaining to their past making you feel as if some one is literally peeling off the character's skin and you suddenly get to see a new layer with a different formulation. There has to be a special mention for Burl Ives, who I had never heard of before watching COAHTR and I certainly can not forget him after this. If he received an Oscar for a different movie in the same year he was nominated for his role in COAHTR, I will have to watch his winning performance very soon. Burl Ives is by far the best actor in the movie, as he literally explodes into a power house actor as the story unfolds. His mannerisms, voice modulation and depiction of moments where Big Daddy's stature/arrogance is challenged combine for a supreme acting display. It is an out and out drama but, in so many ways it pans out as a thriller. It will always make questions pop and float in your head and would draw you ever closer to catch the Cat. If you are a fan of drama, its salivation time, if you like thrillers, there is enough to keep you glued and if you just like good cinema, it certainly is good by being 'not-straight' to say the least.www.imnotafilmcritic.blogspot.in",

Jessup in A Few Good Men\"There ain't nothing' more powerful than the odor of mendacity!\" ~Burl Ives as Big DaddyLast week I watched Paul Newman, Elizabeth Taylor and Burl Ives in the powerful Tennessee Williams drama Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Whoa, what a scorcher.THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSBurl Ives is Big Daddy, and he's coming home to celebrate his 65th birthday.. He's just finished having a medical exam to find out what was ailing him, and lo, he got a clean bill of health, so now he's smiling. He's ready to live large once again. The problem, from the start, is a problem of mendacity.Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is one of numerous Hollywood productions of Tennessee Williams plays and Williams introduces its theme early.Mendacity: the quality of being mendacious; untruthfulness; tendency to lie.Brick (Paul Newman) is an alcoholic failed football star who has gone away and remained distant from his family; Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) the wounded wife pushed away by consequences she'd never anticipated. Newman had \"big time\" written all over him, but it wasn't to be as he now deals with his disillusionments. Gooper, his brother, became a lawyer and did all the right things to earn Big Daddy's blessing, but the story is complicated and Williams is brilliant at skimming off the layers of the onion to reveal the story's heart.Big Daddy is a self-absorbed, insensitive modern day (1950's) plantation owner who has more wealth than he knows what to do with. The situation that takes place in the space of a day tells the story of all their lives. Brick, who seems despicable at the first, is actually sees clearly how distorted the family dynamics are, and he wants nothing to do with any of it. His brother Gooper and his wife Mae are determined, as the good son and daughter-in-law, to get the blessing and all the goods that come with it. They've been faithfully producing potential heirs to the \"Big Daddy\" throne and waste no amount energy kowtowing and sucking up.In contrast, Maggie's womb is barren, though not because of her desire that it be so. Brick has emotionally cast her away because of an incident that occurred in a hotel room involving Maggie and his best friend Skipper, who committed suicide afterward. Brick shuts her out so that Maggie never has a chance to tell her side of what happened. The root incident, in keeping with the theme, turns out to be that Skipper couldn't face the truth either.The pivotal theme is mendacity. Big Daddy is definitely going to die and he doesn't know it, yet. This fact, which initially only the doc is aware of, begins to seep through the family and we see, one by one, the various ways in which the characters respond. Ultimately Brick lets it slip. Big Daddy is stunned.The film sets up Brick's character in the opening scene where at three in the morning he tries to run the hurdles, while booze-plastered. We see a brash young man who drinks too much, is careless and breaks his ankle in a foolish manner. The broken ankle serves as an external metaphor for the internally crippled man who deals with his pain through rivers of whiskey.As the film progresses the scales begin to come off the characters' eyes. What Williams does so effectively is to enable the audience to see who these characters are before they each discover for themselves who they really are. It's a Hitchcock device, except instead of a gun in the drawer that only the audience is aware of, it's our knowledge that at some point Big Daddy's going to discover the truth (that his cancer is incurable) that creates tension. Like Brick's broken ankle, Big Daddy's cancer is likewise symbolic of his inner condition. Unlike Brick, whose ankle will heal, Big Daddy's condition is terminal.They've all been living lies in one way or another. Ultimately we learn the root beliefs that formed the motivational drive in each character, with the ultimate revelation coming in the final basement scene with Brick and Big Daddy. It's a moment of truth that flows from the story yet of which the audience has know foreknowledge.This is not a film formulated strictly to entertain. It is a story designed to unveil uncomfortable truths, to enlighten. I have no doubt Williams' aim is for viewers to leave the theater introspectively, asking themselves how much mendacity and self-deceit they themselves live with.If you hear echoes of the parable of the prodigal son, you're probably not far off from the impetus for the original play.As for the acting, it's first-rate throughout. Newman, Taylor, Ives and the supporting cast are stellar.",

Of course, Mr. Newman's injury has nothing to do with sexual desire, and if you watch closely, Newman distances the alcoholic. He and Ms. Taylor knew what the play was about. Taylor seems born to play Tennessee Williams. And, Burl Ives preserves his virtuoso Broadway performance.Newman and Taylor were nominated for \"Oscars\" while Mr. Ives' \"Big Daddy\" seemed to be overlooked, but wasn't, as \"Academy\" voters gave Ives the year's \"Best Supporting Actor\" for his nominated performance in \"The Big Country\" (1958).

On screen it was cardboard stereotypes playing small personal melodramas. Sound quality very poor, alternately too loud and too soft, and only fully intelligible at high volume. Add to that monologues delivered way too rapidly to be understood, much less comprehended. This play would do better in a small theater with good acoustics. The movie would have done better with a smaller-than-life cast, playing down to the level of the pathetic characters instead of pumping them up into cartoons.A half hour was enough time spent sucking this bitter pill, and back in the mail whence it came.",

            "content": "I kept seeing the beginning and ending of this film throughout the 70s on the weekend afternoon movie (Saturday or Sunday), and it was one of those \"boring adult movies\" about stuff that only adults care about.And then when I finally saw all of it when I was in college, I still didn't like it a whole lot. Newman's character poking fun at Taylor's bragging about places she's never been, and Newman getting called out on his short comings, all makes for an interesting character analysis if you're into that sort of thing.I guess the thing I find frustrating about so called classic films is that there's a lot of social taboos that people want to tiptoe around. Me, I just didn't get what the heck these people were hung up about. Apparently the lead characters liked one another but couldn't come to terms with their character flaws. The best I, as a casual viewer, can comment is say; \"Oh well.\", then change the channel and hope that Star Trek or something with a little more action or brain power was on.And no matter how well a film is acted or shot, if the story material is taboo and yet still vapid (or vice versa) I just don't let it register. I think of all the films that danced around sex in all forms, love in all forms, and whatever else, or even a failing marriage, money and lawyers, and I think to myself \"Are these people for real?\" And that's kind of the sense I get with this film. It needed an alien invasion, a dog fight, and a few more action sequences to spice it up. With apologies to Tennessee Williams, I think writing about hidden taboos and acts thereof is absolutely the dumbest thing in the world. People make up social codes, and seeing Taylor and Newman navigate their way around them to get to the core of what they want is a real bother and bore.I felt like jumping in, slapping a pair of handcuffs on both, and shipping them off on a two month cruise. But that's just me.Well shot, made for a late 50s early 60s audience, when the nation was grappling with sex and race as hot domestic social issues, it gives a window into what the film industry was addressing as a placebo to keep people from throttling one another. Otherwise I'd pass it up. There are better films out there.Watch at your own risk.",

            "review_title": "Explosive Tennessee Williams Drama",
            "content": "I love a good, emotional drama with powerhouse performances- so I most definitely love 'Cat On A Hot Tin Roof'.Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman dispel any doubts over acting ability in their respective portrayals of Maggie 'The Cat' Pollit and Brick Pollit. The couple have gathered, along with Brick's older brother Gooper and his very fertile wife Mae, at 'Big Daddy's' (Burl Ives, in a terrific performance) estate for the old man's 65th birthday.This is not a happy family reunion, however. Brick, a former star athlete, has degenerated into an alcoholic over both the death of his close friend Skipper and his now-past days of glory. He drinks the day away and is cold towards his sexually and emotionally unsatisfied beautiful wife, Maggie. Big Daddy has just been tested for cancer, and Gooper/Mae can't wait to jump in on his estate. Maggie has other ideas, but first she must shock Brick out of his current emotional state in order to hold onto the property and the man she loves.This is a powerful film. Taylor and Newman are simply explosive as the warring Maggie and Brick. One can feel Maggie's hunger and attraction in Taylor's cat-like eyes and aggressive, yet tender, actions. Paul Newman should have won the Oscar for his portrayal of Brick. This Method-actor never misses a beat in his role, and his acting style really compliments Taylor's classical approach. The effect in itself is curious to watch, as it is in that other filmed Tennessee William's classic, 'A Streetcar Named Desire'.Newman's moody intensity perfectly matches Brando, whilst Taylor eerily resembles Vivien Leigh in a number of scenes.Before I saw Taylor in this, and 'Giant', I wasn't much of a fan of her acting ability (I thought she lacked it, actually). Well, I'm a fan now! The couple are perfect eye-candy. Newman is HOT! Seriously, he is one of the best-looking men I've ever seen up there on the screen. His beautiful blue eyes and tentative smile make the heart melt. Taylor is stunning, as usual- how could Newman resist her whilst she hungrily follows him around their room in that white slip? A lot of will power and great acting ability, I do believe.The greatest thing about 'Cat' is it's emotional impact. The story still resonates today with a modern audience, despite the film's stagy look and overly 'talky' manner'. Brick cannot handle all the mendacity, the lies, the secrets in the world, so he shuts himself away and drinks. He feels a washed-up failure, and has an uncertain relationship with his overbearing father. Brick is Big Daddy's favorite son, yet Brick feels he still isn't good enough for him and all his achievements have been for nothing.This film is about facing up to life's struggles head on. As Maggie says 'There are some things in life you've just go to face'. Brick must deal with the guilt he feels over the death of his homosexual friend Skipper and face up to his demons before he can have a functional relationship with Maggie. Maggie must admit her mistakes to Big Daddy and Brick before she can be set free from her cage.Rising above all this tumult is the brilliant Burl Ives as 'Big Daddy'. The family head discovers he is dying of cancer, and his days are numbered. Big Daddy has to face death, and life's demons. The only advice he can give Brick is harsh, but true. Drawing on his own experiences, Big Daddy knows he has the guts to die. But has his son got the guts to live? This one will make you examine yourself, others around you, and the meaning of your life.",

            "review_title": "a great cast in the film version of one of Tennessee Williams' great plays",
            "content": "Paul Newman, Elizabeth Taylor, Burl Ives, Judith Anderson, Jack Carson, and Madeline Sherwood star in \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,\" a watered down version of the Tennessee Williams hit play that starred Barbara Bel Geddes and Ben Gazzara on Broadway and was there directed by Elia Kazan. The film is directed by Richard Brooks, as apparently Kazan and Williams did not get along.Now for my big confession - I have never cared for this play because I find it extremely loud, strident, and ultimately irritating. This includes the television version with Sir Laurence Olivier, in which he looked like Colonel Sanders that also starred Jean Stapleton, Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood. I think the main problem is that \"Cat\" was written for the stage and doesn't play as well in any other venue - certainly not on television, where these larger than life characters become overwhelming.It's the story of a dysfunctional southern family with a dying patriarch and an alcoholic son who broke his leg recreating a moment of glory on the football field one drunken night. He has turned away from his wife; meanwhile, his brother and sister-in-law continue to breed brats and hope to get most of Big Daddy's estate once he dies. The film is criticized because the censors demanded that references to Brick's homosexuality be eliminated from the script. Seen with today's eyes, it's an unnecessary criticism. Brick started drinking after Skipper's death; Skipper hated Maggie, Brick's wife; Brick started a football team because, while he was good enough to play with the big pros, Skipper wasn't; and Brick isn't interested in sex with his gorgeous wife. Hello. How many other ways are there to say it? As with anything that stars Paul Newman, there is some brilliant acting to be had, and as Brick, he delivers, though perhaps he isn't quite enough of a bum. Elizabeth Taylor has been blessed with many gifts - an incredibly beautiful face being one - but she was behind the door when the great voices were given out. As Maggie, her voice is particularly cloying, though she gives an excellent performance. She was working under the terrible burden of having lost her husband, Mike Todd, right after filming began. At the age of 26, her professionalism is astonishing, and she looks sensational throughout the film during what must have been a horrible time for her. Supposedly the director insisted on repeat takes of the scene during which the family eats in order to get her to take some nourishment. Like Lana Turner, Taylor is one of those stars whose career accomplishments took second place to her private life in the mind of the public. Given the quantity and quality of much of her work, it's really not fair.Burl Ives successfully repeats his stage role; Madeline Sherwood is brilliant as the annoying wife of Gooper, and Jack Carson plays Gooper well, though it's not much of a role. Judith Anderson makes a good Big Mama. Ives and Newman score big-time in their long scene together in the basement; it's a very touching and magnificently acted. As far as Big Daddy favoring his alcoholic, childless son over his first-born - the scene where Big Mama admits to having been four months pregnant with Gooper when Big Daddy proposed says it all. Gooper probably isn't Big Daddy's son.Recommended for the performances, but keep the volume down on your television.",

            "content": "RIP Paul Newman. I knew that I had seen part of this movie before, when Maggie was in her white slip in the bedroom with Brick. I wondered why Paul was playing such a mean, verbally abusive part in this movie, compared to his nice-guy Butch Cassidy or his clever merry-go-round operator in \"The Sting\". Turns out that tonight (on TCM's 24-hour Paul Newman Marathon) I decided to watch this entire movie, to see what really happened. This time I realized that Maggie was egging Brick on, questioning him why he did not pay attention to her. During some more scenes, I realized that Brick was just mumbling reactions to her questions, and he got more vocal as his boozing increased. Later, near the end, when Brick and Big Daddy were making amends in the basement, Big Daddy wondered why Brick thought more of Skipper than his own father. Brick said his father never loved him. Meanwhile, Maggie was accused of sleeping with Skipper, driving Brick's jealousy and resentment. From comments I read about the play from which this movie was derived, Brick had a homosexual relationship with Skipper. People's comments don't say why Brick married Maggie, but Brick said that he got married because Big Daddy wanted him to. In our day and age, Brick could have have married Skipper and avoided this entire mess. Skipper would still be alive, and maybe calculating how he and Brick could inherit Big Daddy's entire estate.In this story, I think that Brick was leaving Skipper to marry Maggie and move with her to live in Big Daddy's mansion, and Skipper was so dejected that he committed suicide. The mores of the 1950s would not let the explicitly gay theme into this movie, so the Brick-Skipper-Maggie conflict was rather fuzzy and difficult to follow. Brick was still in love with Skipper, and could not perform sex with Maggie, leaving Maggie to constant ridicule by stupid Mae and her no-neck chinless mongrel tribe. At the end, Brick decides Maggie is desirable after all, and gets ready to impregnate her and give Big Daddy the heir he really wants.My critique and comments about the performances: Paul, as ever, is a beautiful leading man. His Method-emotions run the entire gamut. He plays many kinds of Brick: drunken sot-boozer-alcoholic, impotent/ignoring husband, grieving friend/lover, angry son, loved younger son, loser in his own eyes, ex-athlete, ex-sports announcer. Elizabeth Taylor is stunning, clever and resourceful. She realizes that her financial future lies with Big Daddy naming Brick as his heir, and that BD had better not leave the dough to the stupid Gooper family, lol. Dame Judith (not Dame yet, though) is excellent: fawning, crying, sad, sorry for self, etc. I felt so sorry for Big Mama when she had to hold that gigantic, lighted, gaudy birthday cake, and Big Daddy was telling her to blow his own candles out. The Gooper-kids (my name for the no-necks) played their parts well: obnoxious, stupid, goofy, ugly, crazy and ignorant. I would assume that the new child Brick and Maggie were about to conceive would be beautiful, intelligent, kind, caring and thoughtful. Jack Carson: I love all his old movies, where he is such a happy-go-lucky character, many times alongside Dennis Morgan. Of special note: I loved his singing and dancing with Ann Sothern, in \"April Showers\". Jack Carson is my unsung superstar, and I am not used to his serious character in \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\". Burl Ives: I am glad that BD and Brick ironed out their differences before BD's death. Maybe this helped ease Big Daddy's pain, and BD being without the morphine, would be worth it. I think Burl Ives did a great job in this movie, and I also like him in the Christmas specials plus as a well-known folksinger. The doctor: a big head (looked like a makeup prosthesis) like Orson Welles' in \"Citizen Kane\". It looked a little fakey, but I will forgive. The character was pleasant, peaceful and had tact and restraint. The deacon/preacher-man: smarmy, stupid, ignorant of Big Daddy's true feelings. I am glad Big Daddy kicked him out. Mae: Dumb, stupid, shrieking, conniving, mongrel-dropping brood mare. The actress really played the part well.10/10",

It's hard to find a movie with a lot of brutal, greedy, dishonest and unfortunate characters. This is one of those films.Members of one family have gathered to celebrate the birthday of a wealthy landowner, who is the head of the family. In addition, they eagerly await the results of a medical search, because the landowner is seriously ill. If the results are positive, his children will inherit his fortune. However, family members, finally, have to look each other in the eye and say what they really think ...This is a very explicit drama about the lives of people which are lost in their own lies. They are ready for anger, hatred and greed through \u0084toxic\" dialogue, but are not ready to hear the truth about themselves and their family. Traces of happiness and love are only visible as a kind of illusion.The story, through the constant tension, handles serious family topics. However, serious family problems often transcend logic in one melodrama. This is especially noticeable in the characterization. Complex characters need a lot of space. Conflicts are full of violent and vulgar emotions. It is a more realistic picture of life, which is filled with lies and lack of understanding.I have noticed a certain fear of truth in some of the protagonists. They are actually in conflict with the ghosts of the past and can not move on. Mr. Brooks has tried to show us the real love and happiness in relation to material wealth. However, there is something missing. Perhaps an allusion to homosexuality, which he has skillfully hidden in the story. Perhaps the lack of human warmth .... The story, in which human weakness, the secrets of the past and hidden desires describe human personality is hard to believe.Paul Newman as Brick Pollitt is a former athlete and current drunkard, who is, despite that, looking very good. He despises his wife, who infinitely loves and wants him. Brick is haunted by the spirit of the past - the best friend. Mr. Newman is simply brilliant with a thoughtful expression on his face and a half-empty glass in his hand. An expert for character roles. Elizabeth Taylor as Margaret \"Maggie/Maggie the Cat\" Pollitt is truly a cat on a hot tin roof. She is passionate, impatient, sharp on the tongue, calculated, but desperate woman, who is willing to do anything to restore the love of her beloved husband. Maggie is grumpy and gentle, combative and fragile at the same time. The woman who is on the verge of an emotional precipice ready to stubbornly raise her head and move on.Burl Ives ( Harvey Pollitt) is a real thunderstorm in the house. Judith Anderson (Ida Pollitt) is a woman who can not accept any truth in addition to a sense of illusionary love. It's hard to be a mother. Jack Carson (Cooper Pollitt) is pretty boring as greedy and deceptive older brother. Madeleine Sherwood (Mae Pollitt) does a fine job as a foul-mouthed and squeaky little woman who smelled \"treasure\".Ironically, the film ends with the most pronounced lie. However, afterwards, everyone is happy.",

            "content": "I have just read through most of the comments on this great film. A few responses here, then, first. I disclose that I haven't seen the play on which it was based, and so was unencumbered by either false expectations or relevant expertise.  And I \"walked in\" on the film when Big Daddy disembarked from his plane. I'm undecided whether that makes me mendacious, for hiding from my ignorance, or if that'd just be \"Bull!\"\nNatasha thought \"Guys might get bored\". I notice on the demographics that men outnumber the women among voters, by a factor of 3-4. I suspect that reflects  the centrality (to my -- male -- mind) of the male-male relationships: Brick-Big Daddy, and Brick-Skipper.Maggie of course was a lead character, but -- firstly -- Taylor didn't imbue her with... well, with the life-spirit that her character unwittingly and eloquently claimed at film's end: \"The gift of new life, sired by Brick.\" (I paraphrase.)  Hence, Maggie didn't show any spiritual renaissance as the plot developed. I should be better off, though, remarking that, indeed, the plot gave her no *reason* to change, since (as I recall things) she didn't ever learn anything non-ephemeral. Maggie had a good bit of life in her; but her character was essentially a tool for the development of and between Brick and Big Daddy. Brick's reconciliation with his wife had everything to do with his newfound appreciation of the meaning of mendacity, and nothing to do with either Maggie's past or the manner in which she brought it to discussion in the present.  My feeling was that Brick took to heart his father's purportedly cynical line about the world being a system of mendacity in which we must make love to wives we no longer love -- transformed, in Brick's action, into a healthy rejection of indispensible myths and indispensible truths.So, to conclude that thought. Without presuming to speak against the pleasure a woman viewer might take in the film, guys have more than a few enthralling moments and themes for themselves. My take, at least, is that men, particularly (or perhaps even uniquely), must grapple with forging an identity reconciling Brick's loyalty to Skipper -- and other high-minded ideals -- with his eventual absolution -- and acceptance of a flawed reality.At this point I can't remember what else I wanted to mention. I disagree with most of Telegonus' assessment, though (or: the portions I am qualified to judge). It didn't strike me as dated. Nor did I notice of the behind-the-scenes Williams, \"he is out to enlighten his audience on sexual matters; also on life in the then still exotic Deep South. \" (This may well be my shortcoming.) That is, how was it an attack on \"Middle America\"? Perhaps Telegonus refers to the theme that money can't buy love; I tend to see avarice as a perversion for the extremes of society, the vigilant elites and the covetous proles.That'll do. Now I must sleep and face the day tomorrow without Kentucky bourbon and its \"cold mechanical click\".",

The script does downplay some of the aspects of the original play, but the adaptation works very well in purely cinematic terms. It has more than enough tension and emotion to drive the story, and it is more than melodramatic enough even as it remains.All three of the stars are in fine form.  Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor do very well in making the relationship between Brick and Maggie believable and interesting, even in its less likely aspects.  But Burl Ives gives the finest and most significant performance.  Ives is larger than life as Big Daddy, the character who ties everything else together.  His performance brings out both the strengths and weaknesses of the character, and his confrontations with Newman's character are particularly effective.  The supporting cast also does a very good job, and their generally unlikable characters are believable parts of the story.The involved situation of family conflicts and lies is interesting from the start, and it becomes more engrossing as things develop.  It's the kind of story that can easily become overblown or get out of control, but the cast and director Richard Brooks keep things on track, making this a memorable, skillfully made film.",

            "content": "This is what movies from that era were truly about- great acting, splendid character development, and of course a strong plot to hold it all.Brick (Paul Newman) is an ex football player/ sports announcer drinking heavily and refusing affections of his wife Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) who is still very much in love with him. They seem to have a secret that is the key to his recent binge drinking as well as their marital problems.They have come to the huge family gathering to celebrate Brick's father's (Big Daddy) 65th Birthday, but also to celebrate the good news about his cancer problems- or so everyone is told. Brick's brother is also there with his nosy wife and their 5 spoiled chubby children Maggie cleverly nicknames \"no neck monsters\".With Brick's drinking escalating, Maggie's emotions overflowing, as well as the real news about Big Daddy's health, all the lies, secrets and the kniving reaches it's maximum and emotions spill out. Will the family and our main characters find peace? I guess you will just have to watch it to see it for yourself! Again, the acting is great- everyone does a splendid job to get into the characters and the story itself is also crucial- after all, every family has problems and everyone can in some way relate to the story.The best line of the movie: Big Daddy talking to Brick \"You're just feeling sorry for yourself. Self-pity! You're a thirty-year-old kid. Soon you'll be a fifty-year-old kid. Pretendin' you're hearin' cheers when there ain't any. Dreamin' and drinkin' your life away. Heroes in the real world live twenty-four hours a day, not just two hours in a game. Mendacity! You won't live with mendacity! Well, you're an expert at it. The truth is pain and sweat and payin' bills and makin' love to a woman you don't love any more. Truth is dreams that don't come true, and nobody prints your name in the paper till you die.\"",

            "content": "I am a fan of classic films, but I had never seen this movie until today in my high school English class. We've read \"The Catcher in the Rye,\" \"Antigone,\" \"Fences,\" and \"The Death of a Salesmen.\" So we watched \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.\" First of all, the movie had excellent acting. I adored Elizabeth Taylor's portrayal of the love-seeking woman who rides a constant emotional roller-coaster. Paul Newman was also absolutely amazing. I will never forget the scene in which Maggie grasps on to Brick, and he almost embraces her, but then shakes her away. Then he goes into the bathroom alone and buries his face into her slip that's hanging on the door. It's so haunting, and it shows something deeper in Brick. The other actors were absolutely wonderful as well. Secondly, the symbolism in \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" are incredible. The thing I noticed within the first few minutes of the movie was how the relationship between Big Daddy and Big Momma mirrored the relationship between Brick and Maggie. Also, I loved the use of the weather in the telling of the story. It starts raining, and then it starts storming when the conflict between the characters really starts to roar. When Brick leads Big Daddy up the stairs, they see that it has stopped raining. Their arguments were like a storm. Also, another storm was going on in the parlor with Big Momma, Maggie, Gooper, and Mae. The breaking of Brick's crutch was major symbolism. Alcohol and his story about Skipper had always been his crutch. At the moment he saw who he really was, his crutch was broken. The ending of the movie was very touching. Mae getting what she deserved was so very gratifying. I had kind of hoped that Maggie would have hit her or something, but Mae was given what would bother her the most. She saw Maggie and Brick receive respect, something that she had waived in front of them for the whole movie. The final scene in the bedroom was so simple, yet so thorough. I loved how when Maggie and Brick were embracing, Brick reaches for his pillow from the sofa and tosses it onto the bed. Such a wonderful movie. It will undoubtedly become one of my all-time favorites!",

            "content": "The \"Actors Studio\" founded by Eli Kazan & Lee Strasberg in 1947, introduced the \"method acting\" school to actors of America. Basically it taught young actors to get \"inside their characters\" if they really wanted to be good actors. Brando, Dean, Munroe, Keitel, Pacino, De Niro, and Paul Newman all attended. (and lots of others). I suspect Paul Newman....worked out acting for himself. I like Robert Mitchums reply when asked why Trevor Howard was such a great actor...he replied...\"you will never catch him ACTING\". The A.S. is still doing business today. This movie was about the Robert Mitchum and Michael Caine theories...acting is ONLY about behavior. Newman and Elizabeth Taylor are excellent in the lead roles here. Newman has obviously discarded all that \"method\" nonsense and decided on the behavior theory. The movie is based on a hugely successful Tennessee Williams Broadway smash, and it works on the big screen. It works mainly because each character was cast meticulously, and they all did there job. Most people under the age of 33 (today) will never watch this beyond 10 minutes....to enjoy this great movie you need a pair of ears. Ears that can listen...unfortunately todays audiences want visual effects. And that is ALL ...they want.(poor things..!!)",

            "content": "I use to think that New Orleans was just about Gumbo and Voodoo, the type of things that horror movies loved to milk dry.But then I watched this movie, and saw that they had actually done justice to Tennesse Williams masterpiece, of love, jealousy, misunderstandings, grudges, basically all the emotions that humans breed. In most of William's work violence and sexual tensions are never far below the surface, shallow enough to be scratched at and then seen.In many film adaptations of physiological dramas, the actors tend to be too dramatic or display the character without passion, that driving hunger that the author used to write the piece. But in this film I saw everything I wanted to see, an old man who can't accept death, a young one who is determined to meet it with a bottle of Jack Daniels by his side. His tortured wife who only seeks to make him love her again, and is so scared of being poor when they're old, after all you can be young without money, but you can't be old without it.Then there is the setting of the film, the way they really use an old southern house to show their wealth. The feel that they're actually doing a play instead of a film. The confrontations in Brick and Maggie's small apartment room, or the large basement that holds all the memories of this family.We can also see the pain that Brick shows, the way in which Newman takes this character and isn't afraid to cry or be so addicted to drink that it scares Maggie and the audience, even perhaps himself. Without words, we are shown the demons that rage within him, like a fire. The way in which he wants Maggie, but is too disgusted with himself and his supposed part in Skipper's suicide.Taylor takes Maggie and makes her sexy, intelligent and completely self centred as well as self sacrificing in a multitude of moments, scenes that just about give off her heat, her passion.The character Skipper isn't ever physically seen, but he is spoken of in such frenzied speeches, that we believe he's real, that he actually was a coward, a phony seducer, a leach on Brick's talents.Gooper and Mae are brilliant too, course and loud, but also so vivid that we can't help hating them! All in all Big Daddy and Mamma are the heads of the family, and really seem it, give us the over all emotions of their marriage, their complex relationships and Big Mamma's devotion to a selfish, dying man.When at last the past is brought to the present, all inner words spoken, we finally know that we could know these emotions, these partly insane jealousies and lusts.I love this film, and even when I'm old and gray I'll still feel that I could be as sensuous as Maggie and love a man as righteous, sensitive and beautiful as Brick.The heat of the southern environment and its people are fully reached in this piece. It's a fantastic piece of cinema, may it never be forgotten.",

            "content": "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is a film directed by Richard Brooks, based on the play by Tennessee Williams. The film stars Elizabeth Taylor, Paul Newman, and Burl Ives. First and foremost, this film contains some of the greatest acting in cinema history. This cast is brilliant. The emotion displayed by each actor/actress feels authentic and it evokes the same passion from the viewer. The facial expression and body language within each actor is sensational. You can feel their energy through more than the diction within their tone of voice. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof contains the best acting you will see in any movie, past or present. Every aspiring actor should watch this film and take notes.The story is well written and well paced. The family's conflict is relatable, not because of their socioeconomic predisposition...but because of the passion and love displayed within their character motivations. Paul Newman's character Brick is the centerpiece of the family's love, or lack thereof. His isolation through alcoholism is written masterfully within the film. The story takes place within a single day. The pacing is masterful in that watching the film truly feels like a day in the life of these characters. With an hour and 47 minute runtime, Brooks paced the movie in a manner that actually feel like a 24 hour affair. The story has subtle callbacks and nuances that are left to interpretation. Tennessee Williams deserves a tremendous amount of credit for the writing of this play. The themes within the film are beautiful and exhibit natural human emotion. The theme of love is well explored, and is multifaceted. The notion that we all show love in different ways is captured to perfection. Love can take many forms. In writing this play, Tennessee Williams effectively displays the objective and subjective nastier of love. Whether it be love through money, passion, or familial discourse...this film explores how multifaceted love truly is.Visually, the film is beautiful. Despite originally being intended for Black and White, the color truly brings out the best of the film. The setting of the plantation is gorgeous. The lighting within the film is great. The scenes that contain rain are incredible. The usage of a storm to mirror the family's conflict is brilliant. By the standards of the 1950s, this movie is visually creative and stunning.Overall, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is a masterpiece. Elizabeth Taylor, Paul Newman, Burl Ives, and the rest of the cast deserve credit for showing the true potential of acting as an art form. This is a once in a lifetime film, with an all star cast, a great set, and incredible writing. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is a must-see movie for all lovers of cinema.",

Everything about it screams \"filmed stage play.\" In fact, everybody in it simply screams; the volume is never lowered.

More than looks, each get their chance to show a full range of emotions and needs through the film. Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) gets the lion's share of time to highlight her incredible ability in the first half of the film while Brick (Paul Newman) barely responds, while in the second half Brick is given his chance to explore his pain and why he drinks to wash it away. The screenplay is mostly well adapted from the stage play, though the most glaring issue is thanks to then-Hollywood's ability to represent LGBTQIA+ media. Still, Brick's need for his former partner Skipper is well recognized from tone and facial cues from Newman. The insane band of children from Gooper and his wife are like a trainwreck to watch, and Big Daddy's horrible treatment of Big Mama is a wonderful reflection of how Brick feels in his relationship. The ending of the film is troubling in that no person should wish someone to be trapped in a relationship, which both Brick and Maggie the Cat seem to be, but this story's ending doesn't invalidate the rest of the journey. I give Cat on a Hot Tin Roof an 8/10.",

            "content": "I had heard about this film many times in the past, mainly because of the leading actress, I know it was one of the big hits of the decade, so I looked forward to watching it, based on the play by Tennessee Williams. Basically the patriarch of the Pollitt family, known affectionately as Big Daddy (Burl Ives) is gathering his family at the vast 28,000 acre East Mississippi plantation estate to celebrate his 65th birthday. Big Daddy's son Brick (Oscar BAFTA nominated Paul Newman) is alcoholic ex-football player, he has recently left his job as a sportscaster, he has spent the last few years drinking, and he ends up in crutches after trying to jump hurdles and breaking his leg. In his drunken state, Brick has also been resisting the affections of his wife, Maggie (Oscar BAFTA nominated Dame Elizabeth Taylor), he only agreed to remain married to her on the condition she does not pressure him for sex, their relationship has become turbulent. Big Daddy and Big Mama (Rebecca's Judith Anderson) arrive home from the hospital via their private plane, this is following a medical checkup for Big Daddy, they then gather the family at the house, including Brick and Maggie, Brick's brother Gooper (Jack Carson) and his plump wife Mae (Madeleine Sherwood). Following dinner and conversations, Dr. Baugh (Larry Gates) meets privately with Brick and Gooper to tell the truth about their father's condition, in reality Big Daddy is dying of terminal colon cancer, and will likely be dead in a year. Brick tells Maggie of his father's inoperable disease, she is heartbroken, Maggie wants Brick to take an interest in his father, both for the chance to get his inheritance, and as his son, but Brick stubbornly refuses. As the evening winds down, Big Daddy talks with Brick in his room to explain his disdain of his alcoholic son's behaviour and demands t know why he is so stubborn, Maggie joins them and reveals an incident one night, that happened years ago, where Brick's best friend and football teammate Skipper committed suicide, she was jealous with Brick spending too much time with Skipper, she intended to seduce him, Brick blamed her for Skipper's death, but actually blames himself for not helping Skipper when he repeatedly called him. During an argument, Brick lets slip that Big Daddy is dying of cancer, the group are devastated, Big Daddy is shaken and retreats to the basement, while lawyer Gooper and his wife Mae argue with Big Mama about the family cotton business and Big Daddy's will. Brick joins his father in the basement, they confront each other, while surrounded by hundreds of hidden antiques and family possessions, Brick lashes out into a rage when the subject of his sporting career crops up, he starts smashing things, he eventually stops and breaks down sobbing, he and Big Daddy ultimately reconciliate. The rest of the family start to crumble under the pressure of the revelations, Big Mama steps up to be strong, Maggie gives her present to Big Daddy, which is the announcement that she is pregnant, Mae calls her a liar, although Brick and Big Daddy knows she is lying they defend her, Maggie and Brick reconcile and kiss, and it is implied they will have sex, so the baby lie will become true. Also starring Vaughn Taylor as Deacon Davis, Patty Ann Gerrity as Dixie Pollitt, Brian Corcoran as Boy Pollitt, Robert 'Rusty' Stevens as Sonny Pollitt, Hugh Corcoran as Buster Pollitt and Deborah Miller as Trixie Pollitt. Taylor and Newman were at the peak of their stardom, Taylor is beautiful and despite a slightly dodgy accent is fantastically outspoken, Newman is splendid as the irritated but righteous family member, and Ives, who I know best as the singer of \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\", is surprisingly good as the dying head of the family. You can tell it is based on a play, as the majority of the action takes place in one location, and all the atmosphere is brought about by the overheated dialogue and actions of the characters, the references to sex and homosexuality is watered down for the time, but the revelations and personal demons coming out get your attention, all in all it's a worthwhile drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Picture, Best Director for Richard Brooks, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Cinematography, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Director.

            "content": "\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" is an adaptation of Tennesse Williams' Pulitzer Prize winning play of the same name. Williams focused his play on attitudes toward homosexuality and cynical depiction of a dysfunctional southern American family. The film nicely depicted the home of the family, a vast Mississippi plantation, from outside and in.The head of the family, the imposing Big Daddy, stands out in the film because of the engaging performance of Burl Ives. Ives portrays a confrontational and crass yet uneasy Big Daddy to perfection. Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor were an appropriate pair to portray the friction between Brick and Maggie. The supporting cast also does well in providing the annoyances surrounding the three main characters.The censorship imposed on this film keeps it from reaching its full potential. While the confrontations between Big Daddy and Brick are memorable, with Brick speaking of the \"mendacity\" surrounding him and Big Daddy lamenting his plight, a lot was lost from the original play. The potentially homosexual Brick of Williams' play was replaced by a Brick that needs to grow up, causing the film to lose the full of the potency of the play.Despite the censorship, the film is still worth seeing for the memorable performances. However, the censorship keeps this film from being a classic on par with \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1951).",

However, the screenplay is not quite on par with the visuals, as it is awfully talkative, making it rather hard to take all the content in. It all eventually spirals into a shouting match, which is not entertaining to watch, and Elizabeth Taylor with her squeaky voice is often hard to listen to. Paul Newman however has some really strong moments, and it is certainly okay stuff to watch, with a constant theme of entrapment by social conditions, but I would be cautious to recommend it to non-fans of Tennessee Williams.",

Cat on a Hot Tin Roof has everything ... love, greed, family issues, pain, illness, and yet, they still have parts in it that are quite humorous. Especially the parts with 'sister woman' and her many children. It's also funny to watch Maggie the cat interact with the children. It's very southern, right down to the names, like \"Brick\" who you think would be strong because of his name, but is actually very weak to alcohol. He is the favorite son though and that makes his brother and his wife very upset. They want Big Daddy's inheritance after he dies. By the end of the movie, you find out the truth about why Brick is so cruel to Maggie and you find out what's really wrong with Big Daddy. The movie is one that can be watched no matter how many years go by. It's timeless and it's a true classic. I hope that everyone that watches enjoys it as much as I did.",

Burl Ives makes such a great and believable \"Big Daddy\" (nothing like the lovable Snowman in Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer). The actress portraying his wife is equally as believable as being married to a very powerful and overbearing man. \"Sister woman\" is so vindictive and spiteful, that it is wonderful to hate her character. Gooper makes a great performance as the insecure older brotherwho knows both parents prefer their younger, mess up of a son portrayed by a brooding and bitter Paul Newman, who may or may not be gay. Considering the movie was made in the 1950's, one can understand why his likely homosexuality could not be portrayed as written in the book. And then, there is Maggie the Cat, beautiful and undeniably sexual. Elizabeth Taylor plays her perfectly as the frustrated wife who loves her husband very much, but cannot make the connection with him that she so craves. The fighting and back-biting amongst the family members when they realize that the very rich Big Daddy has a terminal illness is very, very believable. This movie is a must-see.",

            "content": "\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is a 1958 American drama film directed by Richard Brooks. It is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same name by Tennessee Williams adapted by Richard Brooks and James Poe.\"(Wikipedia)Elizabeth Taylor gives her best performance in the role as Maggie the cat, in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof playing opposite Paul Newman, who plays Brick, an alcoholic, in the closet gay. This Tennessee William's play adaptation shows Taylor and Newman's sure power on the screen. The contrast between Elizabeth Taylor's and Paul Newman's eyes is the magical spark that inflames the audience. After the tragedy of Mike Todd's death left an ever showing scar on the newly widowed Elizabeth Taylor, which in turn her sadness and melancholy is shown through her passion for Brick as she tries various ways to seduce the man who she once thought loved her. The secretiveness about homosexuality is curiously brought out through the eyes of Tennessee Williams as well, and is played out perfectly by the Taylor/Newman duo. The rage and missing passion that is seen in Elizabeth Taylor's face will strike the very heart of you and grip you into this tussle between husband and wife. This film is almost foreshadowing to \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" which was released later in the 60's. For any fan of either Tennessee William's, Elizabeth Taylor, or Paul Newman, or just a great performance, this is a great addition to your collection. As Elizabeth Taylor gained her fame to the top of Hollywood royalty, her marriage to Michael Wilding went into turmoil. Elizabeth Taylor basically sought solitude and a safe haven to have children and found that in Wilding. However, as Taylor soared, Wilding's career deflated, which sparked arguments and later led to the couples divorce. Elizabeth Taylor found the love of her life; producer Mike Todd. The two were seen everywhere, toting fabulous jewels such as her famous tiara, as well as Bulgari necklaces and earrings and other noted gems in which Todd expressed his love for Taylor. As Mike Todd's \"Around the World in 80 Days\" hit the screen, so did the couples romance. As a wedding gift and honeymoon, Todd took Taylor on a worldwide tour promoting the film. Internationally the couple gained mass attention, creating crowds wherever they went. Newspapers and tabloids were constantly spreading gossip and creating the attention for them. Unfortunately Todd boarded his plane for New York named \"The Lucky Liz\", while Taylor stayed at home with the stomach flu. Mid-flight the plane failed and Todd and the other occupants all were killed. As soon as the news filtered to Taylor, she went into a tantrum and drank heavily from devastation. Taylor was divorced twice and a widow at the age of 26. Soon after the tragedy, Elizabeth Taylor began the final scenes of \"Cat On a Hot Tin Roof\". Some speculated whether or not Taylor was going to even step foot onto the set, because of locking herself into confinement for multiple weeks after Todd's death. Yet, contrary to rumors, Elizabeth Taylor gave one of the best performances of her career. Elizabeth Taylor gave intense anger and sadness that stemmed from tragedy. As a great actress, Taylor funneled her feelings into \"Maggie the cat\", which intensified her role in the Tennessee Williams play. At first the people behind the production of \"Cat On a Hot Tin Roof\" wanted to make the film in black and white, yet after criticism decided to film it in color. Many said that they would be fools to miss the opportunity to capture Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman's eyes, because of the craze that was behind them. Paul Newman's eyes were crystal blue and could seduce a woman easily just from a glance, and Elizabeth Taylor's eyes were violet and captured the hearts of men across the world. This film would be a great addition to your collection because it captures some of the best performances of the cast's lives. Heart racing scenes and troubling arguments create a feeling of uneasiness that settles into the hearts of its viewers. In addition to that, you also get a look into some of the history of Hollywood as the secretiveness of homosexuality that is confided into the men of the silver screen. Any fan of great plots as well as great acting would surely appreciate adding this film to their watch list.",

I got it in spades.) The real story here is one of a father and a son. And few movies can touch Cat on a Hot Tin Roof for dealing with the raw emotions of a strained father/son relationship.People always reduce melodrama to \"soap opera,\" as if heightened reality is something to be mocked. Yet, ask them to read Aeschylus of Shakespeare, and they are considered geniuses... if you want reality, go outside. If you want drama, yes, there will be distortion, manipulation, and all the other classical methods of good storytelling. And Cat is not shy about using these devices. Big Daddy is dying. Being a rich man, Big Daddy also has a will, and it forces an examination of genuine affection versus pandering. Like Charles Foster Kane, Big Daddy has a collection of treasures, most of them covered in dust and many still in their original boxes. Brick AND Gooper have struggled all their lives to get out of their own boxes, to be loved instead of owned. Gooper is the conformist, Brick the rebel, but they both have the same goal. A father's love. As the conformist, Gooper experiences Big Daddy's love through inheriting the material things he so loved. But as the rebel, Brick rejects the material things in favor of the kind of inheritance Big Daddy got from HIS father.True, the role of Maggie is in many ways a diversion from the real heart of the story. But what a pleasant diversion! And though the Hollywood version takes away much of the bite of her storyline, she serves an important role. As the Cat, she knows all about staying on as long as she can, and she uses this skill to help Brick hold on and get what she needs from Big Daddy, and give Big Daddy a little something in return.This is not an easy, friendly movie by any means. Nor is it intended to be. But the hardest work yields the biggest rewards, and the payoff from this film is big.",

I view this film as universal in its themes -father-son, greed, sibling rivalry, and southern in the way it is written much like his other plays. It was very clear that the relationship between Brick and Skipper was one of mutual over-dependency and was not one of give and take and equality as in what I would view as homosexual. It clearly was a neurotic relationship and homosexuality is not necessarily neurotic although many would have us believe that. I am not gay by the way.

            "content": "While I understand the ease of adapting stage plays into movies, the result still feels a lot like watching a stage play on the big screen. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958) is no exception. Adapted from the Tennessee Williams play of the same name, this movie boasts a few big names like Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman. I think this movie probably wouldn't have been as notable unless it had these names tied to it in some way. After all, there's a reason why we still remember these writers and actors today.Even if Cat on a Hot Tin Roof starts slow, the increasing amount of twists and reveals makes for an entertaining movie. I think part of my issue with the slow start might be with Elizabeth Taylor's acting. It felt to me like she was reading memorized lines and didn't put much emotion or effort into her performance. This wooden eventually turned around, but the damage had been done. On the flip side, a very young Paul Newman gave an exemplary performance, even if it's not that difficult to act drunk and disillusioned about a past life that can no longer happen.In the end, a lot of plays cover topics that relate to the human condition. Our ability to handle legacy, death, and new life can come in many forms. Sure, there's something to be said about apathy, anger, or anxiety when facing these topics, but the real character growth comes from acceptance and a willingness to move on. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof provides an ugly set-up that allows the characters to grow into acceptance of their situations, so its entertainment comes in watching them \"therapy it out\" throughout its run time.A chance to see a young Paul Newman at his best, I give Cat on a Hot Tin Roof 4.0 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "Unlike many screen adaptations of Tennessee Williams plays, I experienced a peculiar detachment from the central character, Brick Pollitt, in this instance. There was a missing connection for me, but I can't exactly put my finger on it. Perhaps it was the fact that I just wasn't very convinced of Paul Newman in the role. Either Newman grew tired of the part somewhere along the way, or I lost interest watching him perform as a former high school jock who had a crippling fixation with his former buddy, Skipper, for whose death he holds himself responsible. According to the IMDb trivia page for this film, the role of Brick was refused by Presley, Mitchum, Clift, and Gazzara. As Tony Franciosa and Don Murray were also considered and as James Dean tragically died before this movie was produced, Newman then might have been the eighth choice, or were there even more possibilities that preceded him? Why so many? Was it the potential professional stigma surrounding the obvious undercurrent of Brick's strongly suggested homosexuality in the highly homophobic world of 1958 that was at risk? If so, then Newman deserves credit for daring to do what others would not or could not do.Without the powerful performances of Burl Ives and Elizabeth Taylor, this film would never have been as successful. Ives, who had been considered to be \"just some folk singer\" when he was chosen as \"Big Daddy\", is nothing short of magnificent in his role as the self-made patriarch who is dying of cancer and who seriously reflects upon the true meaning of his life, which is plagued by \"mendacity\" and pretense on all sides. Taylor, who in real life had lost her beloved husband, Mike Todd, in a sudden plane crash just before production, seems to express her grief through her art as Maggie Pollitt, the frustrated (and gorgeous!) wife of Brick. Her interactions with the brood of \"no neck\", spoiled brat nieces and nephews, who invade the family estate for a seemingly endless period of time, are hilarious, especially an ice cream scene that I will never forget. Her several, fiery exchanges with Brick are very passionate, but I still felt that at least some of the couple's extended verbal wrangling could have been condensed.Both Madeleine Sherwood and Judith Anderson play very disagreeable members of the Pollitt family all too well. I found them both very difficult to watch for long, but that's what the script demanded. Jack Carson is perfect as Goober Pollitt, the pathetic, older brother who has dutifully adhered to all of the established family rules but who receives in return no respect from anyone.I can't blame playwright Williams for disliking this very murky screen adaptation of his very serious product. Hopefully, he was grateful for the casting of Ives and Taylor because they both deliver their lines with great intensity and conviction, redeeming what otherwise might have been a dreary affair.",

Newman lounges about on one crutch, drink in hand, looking bored and disinterested; he was far more effective in The Long Hot Summer (1959) and Hud (1963) both directed by Martin Ritt. The arrangement of the actors, the set design and lighting are stage bound, and up close the play seems overcooked, mechanical, tedious and hollow and not as much fun as Lillian Hellman's The Little Foxes, a similar family of monsters drama.

I gone through some IMDb reviews of the film and noticed that many people mentioning poor writing of this film compared to original play of the name. Homosexuality and Alcoholism were two strong pillars of the stage drama which takes place under family crisis but Director and Screenwriter Richard Brooks skipped those heavy parts and that actually made the entire film look poor. We never get detailed and valid answers of why Brick is rejecting such a stunning wife sexually, what's the matter with Skipper that he has stopped living his life and why is he hating his own father so much. While opening up all these reasons the writing falters to leave an impact. Thankfully this simple story is saved by powerful performances and dramatic presentation. Paul Newman is fantastic as Brick and Elizabeth Taylor looks so sexy and hot as his wife Maggie. The real show stealer here is Burl Ives. He totally nails the character of 'Big Daddy'. Judith Anderson, Jack Carson and Madeleine Sherwood does fine enough in supporting roles. The writing lacks detailing but the dialogues are worthy enough to make this drama look dramatic. A subject like Family Crisis is difficult to handle with such an average script but Richard Brooks somehow makes it looks better with his direction. I wish, he would have brought brutality and homosexuality themes from the original and delivered a Classic. Overall, this is Good but not great, thought it had potential.Rating- 7/10*",

At the time however, it was a valiant attempt to get harsh issues such as homosexuality, infidelity and alcoholism past the censors: it was an eye-opener of a movie.We get to follow a pivotal day in the life of a wealthy Southron family. Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) and Brick (Paul Newman) are outwardly the American dream couple, but it soon comes out that he's an alcoholic who refuses to have sex with his wife, whom he suspects of having driven his best mate (and possibly, homosexual lover) to suicide. At the same time the patriarch of the house, Big Daddy, returns from a medical examination, in which he was told that he was sound as a dollar although he was actually diagnosed with terminal cancer, and Brick's older brother Gooper is vying for the attentions of his cold-hearted father.Yep, it's a pretty heady, histrionic stew, the entire season of a soap opera rolled into one. This movie is aimed very squarely at its 1958 audience, which it challenged with a whole raft of unheard-of subjects. And although it plays strictly by the Hays Code (everyone keeps their clothes on and all oaths are minced) it remains shocking until this day. Maggie (Taylor) is one of the most sexually charged women I have ever come across -- she is plain horny, and wielding her sexuality as her one and only weapon. I have never seen anything like her in any other movie. At the same time even she is outdone by her mother-in-law, who blatantly accuses her of not doing enough in the sack to satisfy her son.The movie continues along those lines. It is crass in a good way. The plot itself is somewhat secondary, and it ends with Brick and Maggie spontaneously making up and everyone becoming a happy family again. This makes no sense, it actually just serves to wrap up the movie.I really enjoyed the kids, by the way, they are real brats and a breath of fresh air in the stench of that old mansion.Also, it has to be said that Burl Ives in the role of Big Daddy is out of this world. His role is pivotal, because Big Daddy is essentially a monster. But Ives makes the old, dying, misanthropic patriarch look like an apple-scrumping schoolboy at some moments, and therefore keeps the entire plot together. You have to see the movie just for Ives (OK, and for Liz Taylor looking somewhat lither than she does today).If you have an interest in cinema and history, and are therefore capable of placing this movie in its context, you're in for one helluva ride. But if you're just looking for a good flick to unwind to, it has to be said honestly that Cat On A Hot Tin Roof won't be your best choice. It's one of those movies which takes energy to watch.",

When I started watching the film, I had no idea it was based on his play, later on when I found out, it made total sense. He always seems to treat taboo questions in a very open and artistic manner (in a similar way to \"A Streetcar Named Desire\"). This one deals with a very strong patriarch figure inside the family, \"Big Daddy\" Pollitt, it's not only a pet name, it's also an indicative of his size and place inside the family tree. And he is a hard-headed figure, who imposes his opinions no matter what, a question of obeying the law.The main affected by this tyranny seems to be Paul Newman's character, Brick Pollitt. We meet him as a recovering alcoholic and ex-football player, in a most iconic scene beside Elizabeth Taylor. From the first moment we learn he has some kind of animosity towards his perfectly beautiful wife, the sexual undertones are present at all times. It's instigating, why shouldn't any perfectly normal and handsome husband feel sexually attracted to his perfectly beautiful wife? Hence the genius name of the movie, she feels like a cat on a hot tin roof. Those questions are soon brought to us through Big Daddy's (and the rest of the family) interference in their relationship. The scenes where he and Brick discuss over the motives for his bitterness over life are simply amazing. There's a mixture of sexual frustration, paternal repression, and some level of homosexual affection going on. There's also Big Daddy's health condition, he seems to be ill and his prognosis not so good. Brick in a way wishes him to die, at times it seems like that's the only way he could ever grab domain of his own life again.Although waved to us, full answers are never given (especially the nature of Brick's relationship with his late friend, plus Maggie's involvement in it), because we only have access to a small fraction of that family's feuds, when the (never harmonious) system is already in decadence. The end features an interesting turn of events, the father and son conflict finds some kind of relief, perhaps in the light of nostalgia and death approaching. And so does Brick's relationship with Maggie, the cat, the last scene boasts with lust as we watch their reconciliation as Paul Newman delivers the line: \"Maggie, we're through with lies and liars in this house. Lock the door.\"",

We're going to have to offend somebody!\"Having said that, it also needs to be said that the writers of this film had it easy. On the stage, there was a boy crush in full display between Brick and his football buddy Skipper. All the writers had to do was transfer Brick's desire for his pal and pin it on Maggie the Cat. Making it a matter of jealousy.At any rate, it doesn't really matter; in the end the film is splendidly written and sensationally acted; thus its flaws are that much easier to overlook.",

It is filled with greed and avarice and mendacity. A household feud that has brought the worst out in all the parties. It is like a train wreck, nasty but impossible not to watch.The movie is about Big Daddy who was told he was going to die soon and the contest between his brood to get the lion's share from his vast estate. Elizabeth Taylor, Paul Newman and Burl Ives are the principal actors, and each of them has given amazing performances. They just keep the audience hooked. The three main characters are very realistic and whatever their faults may be, the audience is still able to empathize with them at some point. Compared to them rest of the cast seems to be made of cardboard. None of the others have acted in league with the three principal actors. Also except Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman, none of the characters are referred by their names most of the time. There is big momma, sister woman, brother man and the neck-less kids. It further disconnects us with the secondary characters. Though the movie is excellent, I still wish that they had given more meat to the secondary characters. It would have been perfect then.I think Elizabeth Taylor surpassed her performance in this film only in \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\", which was even nastier.",

It's as if Tenessee Williams threw all his concepts, messages, and metaphors that he had in his noodle into this play/film, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. This movie will give the viewer a lot of food for thought, as there are dozens of messages and metaphors to contemplate as you view this film, it might even scramble your brain like eggs trying to think about all of the messages, concepts and metaphors that this film is conveying to you. Some of the messages and metaphors are very organic with the story and some are not. And some might not even make any sense. Very well acted movie by the three top leads though.

            "content": "\"Cat on a hot tin roof\" is a movie about a deeply devided family. There is quareling between couples and within couples.The film is situated during the 65th birthday of the \"pater familias\" Big Daddy (Birl Ives). This combined with all the fighting ensures that a comparison with \"Festen\" (1998, Thomas Vinterberg) is quickly made. In \"Festen\" it is all about the behaviour of the \"pater familias\" in the past. In \"Cat on a hot tin roof\" it is the future that causes disagreement or, in other words, the battle for Big Daddy's inheritance ignites in full force on his birthday.Quarreling within the couple is mainly done by Brick (Paul Newman) and Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) Pollitt. They have a bad marriage that has remained childless. The alcoholism of Brick does not make it any better. In later movies both Paul Newman (\"The hustler, 1961, Robert Rossen) and Elizabeth Taylor (\"Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf\", 1966, Mike Nichols) played characters with difficult relations. In \"Cat on a hot tin roof\" they proved very convincingly their talent for this kind of roles.The alcoholism of Brick can be traced back to the suicide of his friend Skipper. If the death of Skipper had such an impact on Brick, he maybe was a little bit more than a friend? Contrary to the novel by Tennessee Williams the film does not address this question. Too sensitive in times of the Hay production code.In the end the quarelling becomes Big Daddy too much and he retreats in the basement. Surrounded by all the useless things he has accumulated during his whole life there is a touch of \"Citizen Kane\" (1941, Orson Welles). Brick visits his father in the basement and they talk (\"I've got the guts to die. What I want to know is, have you got the guts to live?\"). The second part of the film had a flavour of \"King Lear\" (will Big Daddy succumb to the one who is best in flattery or can he tolerate the one who tells him the truth). In the end I think Big Daddy is wiser than King Lear.I already said that Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor were very convincing as the quarelling couple. To portray the broader fight in the family you also need very good supporting actors, and there they are. Birl Ives is brilliand as Big Daddy and Madeleine Sherwood is very good as the daughter in law of Big Daddy who is very good in flattery.",

He is also impotent, and the issue of this is never delineated, including the issue with a deceased football buddy who is the supposed reason for his drinking.While Newman is believable,I found his performance a bit stilted and awkward, perhaps because the real crux of this story involves homosexuality,but is veiled with conversations and innuendo. Despite the era in which this film was made, it would seem the issue could have been presented more meaningfully. Brick's self-loathing is never fully explained, or examined, and this mars the presentation.",

            "content": "Okay, so maybe saying that this movie would or did set back the industry 50 years (see Trivia) is a little extreme, but I think that this movie IS really flawed.  Now I might be a little biased, having been raised on both modern drama and modern movie acting; also, I deliberately watched the movie shortly after reading the play, for comparison's sake.First, the acting; as the acting is really the only thing driving the film, I'll spend the most time on that.  I would definitely argue that the acting improved as the movie went on, and that's probably because the scenes got more dramatic and interesting.  At certain points, though, it was just bad. I'm thinking particularly of one of the early scenes between Brick and Maggie in their bedroom, right after Maggie is hit with ice cream by one of Mae's children (which, as I'm sure the film intended, were INCREDIBLY obnoxious, so kudos there).  Anyway, the acting in that particular scene is just poor...Elizabeth Taylor is shrill and over the top, and Paul Newman is too withdrawn and expressionless.  Maybe it's just the sheer contrast, but it was too much.  I should say though that later in the movie, given the more complex and subtle character interactions, both Taylor and Newman got much, much better and more interesting.Now I'm not sure how much sympathy the character of Brick is supposed to elicit from the audience.  Newman stays essentially true to the way Williams wrote the character particularly in the first half of the movie (after which the film script completely deviates from the play), and he comes across as self-involved, hateful, and just generally not a good person.  You really feel for Maggie, and while I'm sure that's the intention especially given the title of the play, I think that Newman (along with many others) should have given the character more subtlety, and a more complex relationship with Maggie than sheer revulsion.Now not to turn around and complain about the opposite problem, but for all of the improvements in character and acting in the latter half of the film, I feel that the director took some artistic liberties with the script that can't be forgiven.  While Brick's reconciliation with his father is heartfelt and indeed touching, the play script is much more subtle about it. Also, the ending was completely reworked by the director/screenwriter to a much more \"Hollywood\" (i.e., neat, happy, etc.) ending.  Again, I have to say that the original play ending is much more interesting: after fabricating the lie about being pregnant, rather than Brick coming to terms with himself and seemingly realizing his love for Maggie as evidenced by that last kiss in the movie(whatever happened to his latent homosexuality?), Maggie destroys all of his alcohol and tells him that after he sleeps with her and makes the lie a reality, they'll drink together.  Brick accepts this, and they enter into a sort of content partnership that itself is touching in an odd way.The film has its strong points, though.  Aside from the two leads, Burl Ives' Big Daddy was sincere and convincing for the most part.  I particularly liked the performance of Madeleine Sherwood as the more-than-a-little-annoying Mae, and Judith Anderson was terrific as Big Mama.In general, though, it could have used a good deal more subtlety, and the director made some pretty bad choices, though it wasn't without its moving and genuine elements.  I'd give it a 6 out of 10.",

Every actor in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is dead on with his or her performance. The supporting actors show unique talent to keep up a great team. The best acting in the movie comes from the three main characters, Elizabeth Taylor, Paul Newman, and Burl Ives. Taylor is charming and tragic in her sexually repressed role as Maggie the Cat, while Paul Newman's troubled soul hiding a dark secret as Brick is very compelling. Far from the role of a lovable snowman in Rudolph is the role of Burl Ives as the cynical Big Daddy. Together with wonderful direction by Richard Brooks, the film brings an important message of how mendacity affects each person's life. It is confrontational, as most of Williams's pieces are, and explores deep human emotions, and how those emotions contribute to a life shadowed by mendacity, rather than facing truth. While the story is tragic, it also carries great hope in the end for the characters. Truth overcomes mendacity in a bittersweet way.",

The theme is good - he is an alcoholic, his wife adores him but he can't stand her. You expect very serious and clever story behind that. But... They didn't have a single completed conversation in a whole movie. It just sounded naive. Later in the movie, his dying dad tries to communicate with him numerous times and it ends nowhere. It's like the people that made this movie didn't have enough ideas and very poor skills when it comes to creating a caracters cause not a single one of them is elaborated. Most of the conversations are so full of hope - great, I'll finaly understand why this people behave that way, but in the end there is nothing. It's very naive, it's like you decide to make the most delicious cake but leave it 50% work unfinished. There is no real explanations for any of the caracters behavior (which is, by the way, most of the time exagerrated so you think there are pretty good reasons for that but you never find them out - you just get something like excuses of 5 years old child ). Great theme, great potential, good actors, but very poor script and not elaborated well.

But somehow this is still a very good film; gripping, intense and emotional. The fact that this is oh-so-very-obviously an adaption of a play is it's downfall, but what comes with it makes up for it- namely intense confrontations between characters, powerful acting and simple but effective story. Paul Newman and Elizabeth Tayler are great, their performances creating the only two likable characters in a film full of hateful liars. It's a better film than it should be; you may find yourself rolling your eyes half the time, but the rest of it is too powerful to let this spoil it. The films biggest fault is actually the character's names. Brick, Gooper, Big Daddy- cringe inducing attempts at colourful names. And i'm sure you'll agree the hundredth time somebody says 'Big Daddy', before forgetting all about it as the extremely dysfunctional family argue their way to forgiveness and redemption.",

Watching such beautiful specimens as the young Newman and Taylor makes you want to leap on the stage and bring them together with you as part of a threesome. Burl Ives is a larger-than-life patriarch who nevertheless seems almost real. Even Jack Carson performs beyond his usual low-key standard. Then there's the slick dialog, except when it's watered down for 1950s Hollywood. People don't talk like that in the real world, but there's no substitute for poetic genius and years of performing and refining the dialog. Finally, even after so much psycho-history, this is still a fascinating portrait of very unhappy people facing age-old problems. But\u0085unfortunately the story ends with a patriarch's impending death saving 2 marriages, curing alcoholism, and making him a loving father - all in the space of an afternoon. So you may be left with a sickly sweet taste. Read the play first, then watch the film \u0096 let the former inform the latter, the latter give color and electricity to the former.

When Maggie clings to Brick in their bedroom, desperate for him to make love to her, he raises his hands slightly, as if to embrace her back, but stops himself, coldly pushes her away, and retreats to their bathroom. As soon as he closes the door behind  him, he turns and buries his face in Maggie's slip, which is hanging on the back of the door. He breathes in the scent of her on the slip, and the hard resolve on his face disappears. He lets down his guard--behind the safety of the closed door--and his passion and longing for Maggie-the-Cat clearly show. If this moment does not move you with its erotic power, nothing will. Subtle, and most beautifully done by Paul Newman.",

Paul Newman, a screen legend, does not appear inebriated in his role, despite the nearly continual drinking he does. Ms. Taylor's sensuality appears extremely dated to me. While I can understand the motives of the characters, the story itself makes just about every character loathsome. What a child actor's parents would have been thinking by placing their child in any of these child characters (other than quick dollars) escapes me.

For example, is Big Daddy really putting moves on his son's wife?Think this film's a dud?

We as viewers get an inside view of each family member's shortcomings, but we also understand and come to empathize with their motivations and longings: Big Daddy's empire-building, Gooper's lawyering, Mae's breeding/social climbing, Big Momma's efforts at gaiety, Brick's footballing prolongation of youth, Maggie's need to be loved.The dialogue is riveting, and the portrayed family dynamic of competitiveness and need for approbation is both palpable and understandable. The big themes are right out front: getting and begetting, desire and mortality. Burl Ives's \"Big Daddy\" is quintessential, larger-than-life patriarch; Paul Newman's \"Brick\" is misspent youth and talent; and Elizabeth Taylor, as the sleek feline whose biological time clock is ringing, is both seductive and pragmatic womanhood in its prime.This movie is an unqualified \"10\"-- a true Classic, tightly constructed and beautifully acted and staged.Folks -- it doesn't get any better than this.",

I'm unfamiliar with the source work, so I was somewhat unenthused by Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) and Brick's (Paul Newman) first scene together, in which Newman vaguely broods and methodically rolls a glass tightly between his palms while Maggie alludes to past folly. Thankfully, business picks up in very exacting ways with the arrival of bawdy Big Daddy (Burl Ives, the film's awesome driving force), facing mortality and in no mood for mendacity. In the watershed scene, he stalks Brick all over the house, uncovering buried secrets and attempting to get to the bottom of the former football stud's impotency and alcoholism. Ives forces Newman to contend with him on an intensely emotional level, finally shaking him out of the complacent Method stupor that mars and makes exhausting his scenes with Taylor\u0097it's no stretch to say this sequence rescues the film, vitalizing the tone and humanizing the characters above and beyond their dramatized frailties. One character, however, remains all too prop-like from beginning to end\u0097Madeleine Sherwood's haughty, hissing villain, the pug-faced matron who remains to the bitter end a vitriolic foil to Maggie's wistful motherly aspirations.

            "content": "Contemporary themes with raw acting ahead of its time!\n\nRichard Brooks' Southern Gothic drama Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958) beautifully adapts Tennesse Williams' play of the same name. Brooks brings all the humor of the endless saying of \"Big Daddy\" to life alongside the completely enthralling dramatic performances here. I found each moment captivating and moving by the end. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is peerless writing delivered by iconic actors and actresses in their prime. Brooks' direction is sincere and captures each moment in an intimate way. It's all talking and moving about this one manor as only a Tennesse Williams play could be. \n\nTennesse Williams' writing is like unhinging the jaws of every Southern person of wealth and redneck alike as they bear their souls through their restless maws. These characters feel raw and realistic for a fresh new style back in 1958. His honest words come at each other like poison spewing forth from hostile family members. I actually think Cat on a Hot Tin Roof might be Williams' most enjoyable and straightforward story. \n\nSuddenly Last Summer, A Streetcar Named Desire, The Long, Hot Summer are all excellent, but Cat on a Hot Tin Roof rekindles the flames of passion and deep understanding of a turbulent family in one brutally honest day. Williams' play is as poignant as they come as fathers and sons come to terms, while wives ardently defend their husbands. I like the implication that Brick and Skipper had homoerotic undertones to their close friendship. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof talks about infidelity, homosexuality, fatherhood, death, love, marriage, parenting, sterility, and truth like only Tennesse Williams can write.\n\nPaul Newman is fantastic as the dour Brick, unable to cope with the death of the man he loved named Skipper, he turns to drinking and shutting out his wife Maggie the Cat. All the hurt is in Newman's translucent blue eyes. He wears repressed emotions on his sleeve like a scarlet letter. Elizabeth Taylor's lead actress role as Maggie the Cat is so feminist and empathetic towards her feelings and situation that I'm amazed this came out in 1958. You feel her every glance of longing for the handsome Newman, while feeling her hurt as this family casts her aside. Taylor is drop dead gorgeous, quick witted, and dazzlingly forward in a dynamite display and one of her finest actress performances.\n\nBurl Ives' blunt manner and brute gravitas alongside his deep booming voice are perfect as Bid Daddy. He shuns his grandchildren and wife hilariously over and over again to entertain what is wrong with his favorite son Brick. Ives' heartfelt reminiscing about his tramp father to Paul Newman in the basement is some of the most touching acting I've ever seen. Ives' screen presence is a powerful aura that is undeniable. You are mesmerized by his strength of character and perceptive ability to spot lies except for the one told about him.\n\nJudith Anderson is great as the hysterical Big Momma in denial about her terminally ill husband Big Daddy. Jack Carson is great as the foolish Gooper, who loves his father and brother, but who desperately wants control of his father's wealth in his will. Madeleine Sherwood is a riot as the overly affectionate and pushy wife to Gooper named Mae. She's so unbelievably callous and mean in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, you'll hate her for sure! Larry Gates is excellent as Dr. Baugh, who doesn't want to tell his patient about his imminent demise.\n\nFerris Webster's editing is brisk and quickly cuts around each scene in a natural and unobtrusive way. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof feels less than its already short 108 minute run-time. William H. Daniels' cinematography is great as he basically follows all the action and dialogue with clever angles and perspectives. Charles Wolcott's score is pretty with minimalist piano and melodies to merely suggest scandal and emotion, all provided already by the killer actors and sizzling script. Helen Rose's pretty costumes and William Tuttle's make-up look authentic to the time and place in hot Southern Summer weather attire and sweat.\n\nIn conclusion, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is a triumph of verisimilitude in acting and genuinely earnest writing. The endearing acting from Elizabeth Taylor alone is worth seeing Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.",

Magnetic and almost entrancing with her acting. Big Daddy almost looks like Phillip Seymour Hoffman lol. Interesting to see how all of Big Daddy's family members are showing an enthusiastic interest in him mainly because of inheritance and the estate. I don't understand why Brick is reprising his love for Maggie so harshly. If it were me, I'd be making love to Maggie like every 30 minutes lol. Jeez, Paul Newman was a beautiful man, a beautiful man indeed. His eyes are like oceans. God damnit, those kids and their mother are annoying as fuck singing all the time, trying to entertain Big Daddy. The actor who played Big Daddy was so good. I love how he plays the detective in all this. How he figures out everything that went on between Maggie, Brick and Skipper. The dynamic between him and Brick is explosive. This movie proves how unhealthy it is to be repressed. Jesus Christ, I hated Mae. She was like a little demon, even looked like one. Her and Cooper don't deserve the estate. \n\nThis movie's very funny at times especially with all its sharp dialogue. Terrifically and powerfully acted. This movie is almost like a mystery being solved. I love it. And all the explosive family drama that unfolds once people start talking is what makes this movie so entertaining to watch. I was glued the whole time. I thought it was very clever that the room where the explosive discussions took place was the same where the guns were stored. I thought it was a fantastic and real look at family matters and the importance of being open. This is a must watch and a must own.",

            "content": "I am somewhat divided on the work of Tennessee Williams as while I could appreciate most of A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) I found the female protagonist to be over the top to the point of being completely unbelievable. This story has the same issues as Maggie Pollitt never seems like a real woman and in the hands of an actress as hammy as Elizabeth Taylor this does not bode well. The tale surrounding her is also less than enchanting as while warring families and overbearing patriarchs are generally the stuff of great soap opera it all builds to an unsatisfying end and the same themes have been better explored in other films. Despite it's iconic status I have to say that I wouldn't recommend this film as it never really pulls you in and a lot of the performances are shockingly bad.\n\nAlcoholic former football star Brick Pollitt, Paul Newman, is married to the fiery Maggie, Elizabeth Taylor, who wants him to sexually and emotionally desire her so that she can have children. Tensions flare up when Pollitt's father Big Daddy, Burl Ives, who is rumored to be dying arrives in Mississppi after a stay at the hospital and Maggie becomes determined to secure a fortune for herself and her husband before his brother Gooper, Jack Carson, and his large family take everything. Pollitt's alcoholism worsens when they are forced to spend a few days on Big Daddy's estate and the reason for his treatment of Maggie comes to light. He had a possibly homosexual relationship with a fellow football player whom Maggie became jealous of and attempted to seduce so that her husband would feel betrayed. He shockingly killed himself and Pollitt has been unable to forgive his wife since while dealing with his own difficult relationship with his father.\n\nWilliams has a very specific type of man he likes to write, a sexually powerful, brooding man with repressed homosexual desires, and a specific type of women, a loud, needy woman who lives in a fantasy world. Maggie is a variation on Blanche DuBois and Pollitt is a version of Stanley Kowalski as they go around in verbal circles and many of their conflicts seem the same. From the beginning of the film we understand that their estrangement is due to them not being able to sit down and have a five minute conversation in which Pollitt explains his close friendship and Maggie accepts the fact that she will have to share him. Unlike A Streetcar Named Desire this film doesn't have the will to end realistically as the likely homosexual Pollitt happily agrees to have sex with his wife and have a child. We are meant to believe that all of his struggles with his sexuality and his alcoholism have disappeared suddenly and the obsessive Maggie has become a regular wife.\n\nThe characters in the periphery are also considerably less interesting than Stella and Mitch with the broad caricatures that are Gooper and Sister Woman, Madeleine Sherwood, not offering any nuance. Where Stella provides a nice counterbalance to the wild characters surrounding her and Hunter gives possibly the second best performance in that film behind Brando. Mitch is also a regular, well meaning man, for the 1950s at least, who contrasts nicely with Stanley and grounds Blanche in reality for a while. Here Sister Woman is just as crazy as Maggie with her obsession with having her children perform for Big Daddy and snipes at Maggie over her lack of children. The film was never grounded in reality at all and I was never particularly engaged in the theatrics carried out by Taylor, Ives and Newman.\n\nSpeaking of the performances I was greatly let down as Taylor gives one of her most atrocious performances, which is saying something as I have a real hatred for her style of acting. Her southern accent slips into British often and every emotion is spelled out in capital letters as she simply can't help herself with her big hand gestures and pinched expressions. Newman is slightly less awful but he seems adrift in a film that asks him to ham up as he is frankly too good for the material. Ives quickly fades from your memory as while he is a dominating force in the world of the film he doesn't add anything that Lee Marvin or Rod Steiger could not have brought to the role. \n\nIt is clear that I had a real antipathy for the film and while those who are enamored of Taylor may be satisfied I felt disgusted and bored.",

Constant family bickering with old-fashioned southern accents and I\u2019m searching for earplugs. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof was like sitting through Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf all over again, but with a southern drawl. It\u2019s tedious and infuriating, because the entire film is just screaming and yelling for hours. When used in moderation (or confined to specific scenes) a good fight can be a big highlight in a film, but when it is all that a movie has to offer, I\u2019d rather watch a blank screen. If that\u2019s not enough, it\u2019s as if the writer/director was searching for ways to annoy me more, because the fighting was interrupted occasionally for screeching children who can\u2019t sing, shrieking the most repetitive and awful music you\u2019ve ever heard. Now I suspect this was the one part that was actually intended to be a little annoying, because we\u2019re supposed to see this big family of kids as obnoxious, but it almost pushed me over the edge. There isn\u2019t much story to Cat on a Hot Tin Roof other than two families fighting to secure an inheritance from Big Daddy. (As an aside, can I just say how ridiculous it sounds for grown adults to call their father \u201cBig Daddy\u201d? It just makes me think of Blanche from Golden Girls, but I always took that as a humorous character choice, not something actual humans would do.) Then there\u2019s the subplot of an alcoholic who would rather shun his wife based on an assumption rather than have one conversation with her. *Apologies, but I\u2019m just going to spoil the end of the film here* The \u201chappy\u201d ending, that I think we\u2019re supposed to celebrate, is that the alcoholic (who\u2019s had enough to drink during the movie that he\u2019s probably drunk) relents and decides to try and impregnate his wife. Thank God, he has swallowed his pride enough to deign to sleep with the woman he has been abusing in every meaning of the word. I mean, if she can\u2019t bear children then she has no worth! It was the cherry on top of this frustrating sundae that made Cat on a Hot Tin Roof something I did not enjoy at all. I know it is a highly-regarded and well-loved play/film, but it\u2019s clearly not meant for me.",

Paul Newman took over Ben Gazzara's part for the film and Richard Brooks directed.  Newman, Brooks, and Elizabeth Taylor (taking over Barbara Bel Geddes' part) were nominated for Oscars. Brooks does a reasonable job transferring the play to the screen, though most of the action takes place in one room in a Mississippi manor and by action, I mean dialogue.  Newman (Brick) is a former football star, now an out-of-work alcoholic, married to Taylor (Maggie) who he bluntly does not love and with whom he is not interested in having a physical relationship (hence they have no children).  They have come up from New Orleans to hear the results of the cancer screening for Brick's father, \"Big Daddy\" (played by folksinger Burl Ives, whose harshness here is definitely against type - at least from what I remember of the LP we had as kids).  Brick's brother and sister-in-law and their five kids are also there, making a bid for the inheritance.  On one stormy night, all of the tensions implicit in these family relationships are inflamed and explored and, to some degree, resolved.  Although we don't really get told that Brick's guilt over letting down his friend Skipper (ultimately a suicide) years earlier is exacerbated by their same sex love, it isn't hard to read between the lines, if you are tipped off (as most audiences would be).  Newman puts in a sullen performance and Taylor is shrill and anxious - but both relax by the end of the picture.  I'm not sure whether the ending rings true, perhaps not.  But there is no denying the drama and fine acting on display here.",

Tennessee Williams' play is a brilliant portrait of a family fractured by frustrations, alcohol, unfulfilled dreams, and sorrow.   The adaptation suffers from removal of references to homosexuality, an important part of the story, and by the addition of 'feel good' elements in the ending which I disliked (as did Williams and Newman).  It also suffers from emotional fire in the performances.   Williams' words are there (at least sometimes, and minus profanity), but they're not always delivered with the intensity they deserve.  If you want to see Taylor really deliver, watch 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?', which is night and day better.   Even in diluted form, the story is still compelling, but I think you'd be better off reading (or seeing) the play.",

Paul Newman and Burl Ives both got acclaim for their portrayals, but I didn't find them to be anything special. The film doesn't have very good pacing either. I was very disappointed to find the homosexuality elements completely eliminated because it made the story really intriguing and gave it an element of surprise that is lacking in this film. It does get the relationship between Big Daddy and Brick right and I genuinely liked their conversations, but not much else impressed me. Elizabeth Taylor had her breakout role and I thought she was really good in this, but it could have been better.",

            "content": "With legendary actors Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor headlining the film, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof sounded like I should prepare for top notch acting.\n\nCat on a Hot Tin Roof is a lot like the later Elizabeth Taylor film Whose Afraid of Virginia Woolf? for which she won an Academy Award. By that I mean that both films are based on plays and stay very true to the theatrical style of a play. It may stay less true to the playscript as the film is said to have removed practically all of the homosexual themes as well as adding an unnecessary scene involving reconciliation between Brick Pollitt and Harvey \"Big Daddy\" Pollitt, but there is no denying the dramatic strength of the film. I never saw the original Tennessee Williams play or studied it, and based on his criticisms the film could have been a lot better if it failed to omit the themes and concepts that ended up absent. And I will say that for me, films which stay true to theatrical styles evoke mixed feelings with me because they stay true to the source material but also fail to elevate themselves as films all that much. Still, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof does maintain a strong production design with all the appropriate props and scenery to give a sense of atmosphere as well as the fact that the cinematography is a nice mix of traditional stage style and cinematic which gives viewers a good sense of being in the situation. All in all the visual style of the film is nice because it is subtle yet beyond the simplicity of a stage production which means that it finds a balance between cinematic and theatrical.\nCat on a Hot Tin Roof does not feel as complicated as it could have. Despite having a strong depiction of the relationship between Brick Pollitt and his father Harvey \"Big Daddy\" Politt, the characters outside of the predominate three figures in the story are not explored all that well, nor is the relationship between Brick Pollitt and Margaret \"Maggie\" Pollitt. All we get from the latter is that there is a level of tension involved, partially due to Brick Pollitt's self-destructive alcoholism, but it is clear that there is more to it than strictly what is projected in the film. I'm not sure if there is more complications explored in Tennessee Williams' original playscript, but considering the other omissions made, I would not be surprised if that was the case. Still, the screenplay is good enough because it does maintain a lot of strong characters and gives the actors firm dialogue to work with in the roles.\nSeeing as it is a very theatrical feature, the most important elements of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof boil down to what the cast can bring to the film, and fortunately they are all in top form.\nPaul Newman is just spot on in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Even as a drunk and selfish man, it is easy to sympathise for his character Brick Pollitt in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof because he is just such a naturally charming actor. He has the most beautiful blue eyes in Hollywood history and a line delivery which is stern without ever being melodramatic. But what's most impressive is his projection. Paul Newman finds the perfect balance between theatrical acting and cinematic acting in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof which is brilliant because that means he ties directly into the general theme of the rest of the film. His line delivery is dramatic with certain elements of subtlety that never go as far as melodrama, and he makes such a compelling case that his performance is unforgettable. Paul  Newman's charming performance in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is just refreshing, and it reveals the legendary actor's keen abilities for theatrical acting. Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is really one of his best performances, and you can expect nothing less from him.\nElizabeth Taylor is also top form. Her performance in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof reminds viewers why she is considered both one of the most beautiful women to have ever lived and one of the most talented actresses of all time. She is able to constantly maintain an appropriately heightened level of dramatic tension in her role which she uses to project the distress of being a wife who is emotionally isolated from her husband and left with the curse of being barren. Elizabeth Taylor easily makes her role a very sympathetic one and has the ability to draw the viewer's attention to her as she grips the part with such tenacity that when she engages with any of the surrounding cast members, the result is easily impressive. Her performance and particularly her chemistry with Paul Newman prove to be some of the most powerful dramatic forces behind the film, so she is just perfect in the part of Margaret \"Maggie\" Pollitt. \nBurt Ives is also terrific. The endeavour of his role is largely predicated on the scenes where he interacts with Paul Newman due to the tension of the shattered father son relationship they share being one of the film's most important themes. He is really gritty in his role and as the story progresses you can see him gradually coming to terms with his own mortality and the nature of his relationship with his son. He is constantly developing throughout the story without a moment where he steps out of line, and his line delivery is really tense in the appropriate manner for the character. Burt Ives brings a powerful effort to his role in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.\n\nSo although Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is not as deep or complex as it could be and omits Tennessee Williams' homosexual playscript themes, it is a well-crafted and firm drama film with the benefit of astounding performances from both Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor.",

This film is about a very wealthy family in the American deep south that is totally miserable and dysfunctional. There is so much anxiety, stress, tension it is palpable. That, along with all the yelling and screaming can give one a serious headache. However, once the story finally unravels it becomes quite powerful. The patriarch of the family, called big daddy, (burl Ives) centers the film. There is a darkly hilarious scene early on in which a group of children are annoyingly playing the song Dixie over and over, and holding a Confederate flag. And there is enough eye candy for at least four movies as it features a young Paul Newman, and Elizabeth Taylor.",

            "content": "Based upon the Pulitzer Prize winning play by Tennessee Williams, and directed by Richard Brooks (Elmer Gantry (1960) and $ (1971)), this is a powerful drama with 3 brilliant performances at the centre of it. While Williams disliked the film because it toned down the some of the more mature qualities of the play, it's still a good film to watch, never forgetting it's theatrical roots. In Mississippi, Brick Pollitt (Paul Newman) and his wife Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) return to his family's plantation to celebrate the 65th birthday of his father, Harvey \"Big Daddy\" Pollitt (Burl Ives). Brick is an alcoholic, and he recently broke his foot while trying to hurdle in the dark, and he spends most of the day inside drinking. Big Daddy has just returned from the hospital after having a cancer scare, and Big Mama (Judith Anderson) tells everyone that Big Daddy is not dying from cancer, but that's not true, because Big Daddy IS dying from cancer, but he doesn't know that. Brick finds out, and tensions between Big Daddy and Brick reach breaking point, because of Brick's drinking. It's a powerful drama, and it's a picture of an old fashioned side to America. Newman and Taylor give brilliant performances, but it's Burl Ives who steals the show as Big Daddy, this man is such a force of nature. It's a shame he won an Oscar for The Big Country (1958) over this, as he gave a superior performance in this.",

            "content": "Maggie the Cat (Elizabeth Taylor) is going to explode.  It's summertime in the Deep South, and her father-in-law, the big-mouthed Big Daddy Pruitt (Burl Ives), is back in town in time to celebrate his birthday following a health scare.  She loves Big Daddy and his wife, Big Mama (Judith Anderson), but hates everyone else staying at their sprawling southern property for the festivities.  She hates Gooper (Jack Carson), her self-serving, money-minded brother-in-law.  She hates his wife, Mae (Madeleine Sherwood), a big-headed, ball-busting busybody.  She hates their goddamn kids, who are noisy, no-neck monsters.  And she especially hates her husband, Brick (Paul Newman), a has-been football star who's taken to the bottle to wash his problems away and who has decided that their sex life is over.\n\tShe deserves better than this.  She's alive.  \"You're a drinker and I'm childless,\" Maggie sighs to Brick at the climax of one of their countless fights.  She's at a crossroads in her life: part of her figures that she's at her youthful prime and would be happier playing house with a man who fulfills her emotionally and sexually, but another figures that Brick is fixable, handsome, and can only work his way out of his funk with her leading the way.  For now, though, she's miserable.  Sometimes she feels like a cat on a hot tin roof, in agony but without a cool place to land.\n\tAdapted from the Tennessee Williams's play of the same name and written and directed by Richard Brooks, \"Cat On a Hot Tin Roof\" remains vexing despite its watering down of its source, a watering down so noticeable that Williams himself ran down ticket lines of 1958 just to melodramatically warn consumers that the adaptation would set the industry back fifty years.  But contrary to Williams's opinion, this isn't the kind of film that needs to stick with being ahead of its time to stay inflammatory (though it would be nice if its taboo themes were kept intact).  This is the kind of film, better labeled as an acting film, if we're being particular, able to incur hair-raises solely from the puissance of its monologues and its exchanges and its actors.  It's an organic, necessities-only practicing of filmmaking.\n\tSome persist that the film version of \"Cat On a Hot Tin Roof's\" skirting over of Williams's more fomenting detours, paired alongside its stagey production, deter its potency.  But because its central cast is so blustering and because it always seems to be on the verge of detonating, I'd be pressed to decide that it doesn't overcome its stage roots - it's far too tempestuous of a force to be reckoned with.\n\tIt erupts with high-powered drama, controlled, moving, and Southern-fried.  I lapped up every minute of it.  Movies in which characters are confined to a single setting, unable to avoid the conflicts coming at them at the speed of light, and in which dialogue is an art in and of itself, are movies I cannot withstand so long as they're done right.  Expectedly, \"Cat On a Hot Tin Roof\" is done right, though I can't imagine it going wrong when a cast this magnificent is leading the way and when all involved histrionics are rooted in familial discord.  Brooks keeps tensions high without interfering with the superiority of his performers.\n\tThe film isn't just perturbed with the marital woes of Maggie and Brick - also decisive is Big Daddy and company's dealing with the later-revealed fact that he's terminally ill - but it's \"Cat On a Hot Tin Roof's\" most unforgettable feature and certainly its most exigent.  Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor are so abominably beautiful that their sexual frustration practically explodes off the screen.  These desirable people should be fornicating - they're the poster children of the passionate embrace and the idealized, silk sheet enhanced romp - and so their bursting at the seams sexual tension doesn't just shout at us: it screams, like it's got nothing left to live for besides one last roll in the hay.\n\tIn 1958, no actors were as electrifying as Newman and Taylor.  Though Newman was still in the process of rising in the ranks of the industry, while Taylor, by comparison, was the most famous woman in the world (and the most famous widow in the world after her husband, producer Mike Todd, was tragically killed in a plane crash), both were equally driven to prove themselves as severely pretty faces that could also act.  As Maggie and Brick, a pair of knockouts struggling with differing carnal dilemmas, Taylor and Newman are galvanizing.  \n\tTaylor, raven-haired, tiny voiced but capably loud, is every man's fantasy: she's a firearm of sex, locked and loaded with temptation and drive.  Newman is an embodiment of classic masculinity subtly being destroyed by alcoholism, severe depression, and hidden homosexuality (which is glossed over in the film).  Taylor's Maggie can't understand why her husband won't make love to her; Newman's Brick knows exactly why he's incapable of making love to his wife, and it's killing him.\n\tAdd this erotic discontent to an already strained family gathering and you've got yourself a hell of a film, dynamically haughty and as tight as a Hitchcock thriller.  Sure I like it less when attitudes even out and emotions stop running so high - I'm more turned on when it's about to rupture than when it's cooling itself off - but there's no point in challenging the brilliance of \"Cat On a Hot Tin Roof.\" Sparse are films as zestfully written and as expertly acted as this one, and when the material is so flavorful and when the acting is so robust, I'll take what I can get.

For me, who doThis film is based on an interesting play by Tennessee Williams, that has already become a classic of American theater. Therefore, I believe that expectations for the film were high, when it opened, for the Anglophone audience. For me, who do not know the work of Williams, it is different: I cannot compare the film with a book I have never read or a play I have never seen.The script focuses on a birthday party at the southern plantation of Big Daddy. The party brings the whole family together because it is known that he will die soon, but that is something that everyone decided to hide from him. He has two children: Gooper, the youngest son, has always done everything his father wanted, married a self-interested woman and has a collection of annoying children; on the other hand, Brick is the opposite, having never had an easy relationship with his father. Alcoholic due to a past hurt and a failed sports career, he married the beautiful Maggie \"the Cat\", whom no one in the house seems to like. When Big Daddy returns from the hospital, convinced that he is in good health, he takes the opportunity to say a lot of what he always thought to each one of those present. This will be the catalyst for many family secrets to be revealed or unearthed.I found the film quite interesting because of the way it plays with a trivial family moment - a birthday party - to create a real family drama. I don't need to read Williams' book to believe that the film was faithful to him: even without having done so, I give credit to the screenwriter's work, even though I know that certain aspects, such as allusions to homosexuality, have been greatly diminished. However, I did not understand why Maggie is called (or calls herself) \"Cat\", even though I understand that she does not feel desired by her husband.The film has a luxurious and notable cast, which does very well both for the effort and the quality of its dialogues. Burl Ives is noteworthy for the effort with which he embodies his character, but Paul Newman is not far behind and is excellent in the way he gives Brick more pain, more psychological intensity than one might expect. Elizabeth Taylor, alongside her, obtains with this film one of the most iconic interpretations of her career, although the character is quite secondary in the story told. She can make Maggie a pleasant character, who is deeply interested, but she can be human and have a big heart too. She establishes a collaboration and chemistry with Newman that is admirable. Jack Carson and Madeleine Sherwood are quite competent in their roles.Technically, it is a very restrained film, leaving the actors' interpretation to speak for itself. Cinematography is extraordinarily beautiful for a film so many years old, the colors are vivid and the light was very well-used, like rain and night, with a storm outside to accompany the storm that unfolded inside. The costumes and sets are very good, the house looks a lot like the plantation of Twelve Oakes, from \"Gone With The Wind\". The soundtrack fulfills its role.",
