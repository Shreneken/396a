            "content": "Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud (AKA: Elevator to the Gallows/Lift to the Scaffold) is directed by Louis Malle and co-written by Malle, Roger Nimier and No\u00ebl Calef (novel). It stars Jeanne Moreau, Maurice Ronet, Georges Poujouly, Yori Bertin and Jean Wall. Music is by Miles Davis and cinematography by Henri Deca\u00eb. A little ole devil this one, a sly slow pacer that itches away at your skin. Rightly seen as a bridging movie between the classic film noir cycle and the nouvelle vague, Malle's movie is in truth straightforward on narrative terms. Julien Tavernier (Ronet) is going to kill husband of his lover, Florence Carala (Moreau), who also happens to be his boss, but upon executing the perfect murder, he, through his own absent mindedness, winds up stuck in a lift close to the crime scene. Outside Florence is frantically awaiting his arrival so as to begin their life together in earnest, but when a couple of young lovers steal Julien's car, Florence gets the wrong end of the stick and a sequence of events lead to Julien and Florence hitching that ride to the gallows. Simplicity of narrative be damned, Malle's movie is a classic case of that mattering not one jot. There is style to burn here, with bleak atmospherics dripping from every frame, and Miles Davis' sultry jazz music hovers over proceedings like a sleazy grim reaper. The ironic twists in the writing come straight off the bus to noirville, putting stings in the tale, the smart reverse of the norm finding Moreau (sensual) wandering the streets looking for her male lover, while elsewhere he's in isolation and a doppleganger murder scenario is cunningly being played out. Deca\u00eb's photography has a moody desperation about it that so fits the story, the use of natural light making fellow French film makers sit up and take notice. While the dialogue, and the caustic aside to arms dealings, ensures we know that Malle can be a sly old fox. He really should have done more noir like pictures. A film that convinces us that Julien and Florence are deeply in love and passionate about each other, and yet they never are once together in the whole movie! It's just one of the many wonderful things about Louis Malle's excellent picture. Remember folks, the camera never lies... 9/10",

            "content": "The former Captain Julien Tavernier (Maurice Ronet) works in the company of the powerful arms dealer Simon Carala (Jean Wall) and is the lover of his wife Florence Carala (Jeanne Moreau). Julien and Florence plot a scheme to kill Simon simulating a suicide. Julien stays after-hours in the company with the telephone operator and the doorman and comes to his office. He climbs to Simon's office using a rope outside the window and kills the executive. He runs to his office to attend a phone call and forgets the rope, and leaves the building with the two employees to have an alibi. When he is ready to drive his car, he sees the rope hanging outside the building and he returns to withdraw the rope, leaving his overcoat and revolver in the car. When he enters in the lift, the doorman shutdown the building and Julien is trapped inside the elevator. Meanwhile the smalltime thief Louis (Georges Poujouly) steals Julien's car and drives to a motel with his girlfriend V\u00e9ronique (Yori Bertin) and lodge using the name of Julien. They drink with the German tourists Horst Bencker (Iv\u00e1n Petrovich) and his wife Frieda Bencker (Elga Andersen) and early in the morning, Louis tries to steal his Mercedes Benz. When he is surprised by Horst, Louis shots and kills the couple. Julien Tavernier becomes the prime suspect of the murder and when he leaves the lift, he does not have alibi for the murder of Simon Carala and the German tourists. \"Ascenseur pour l'\u00c9chafaud\" is the first feature of Louis Malle, who is also one of the writers. The unpredictable and original story is fantastic, the screenplay has many plot points until the very last scene and the performances are top-notch. Julien Tavernier is a methodic military with cold blood that gets caught between the rock and a hard place due to a mistake and lots of bad luck. The soundtrack with the music of Miles Davis gives a touch of class to this little masterpiece. The result is one of the best thrillers entwined with comedy of errors that I have ever seen. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"Ascensor Para o Cadafalso\" (\"Elevator to the Gallows\")",

            "review_title": "A Film Noir Masterwork - Breathtaking to the Eye and the Ear",
            "content": "\"Elevator to the Gallows (Ascenseur pour l'\u00e9chafaud)\" is a master work, so it's startling to learn that it was Louis Malle's first feature. It's a mother lode textbook of how-to for noir genre filmmakers as he creates his own style from what he's learned from other masters.Malle pays tribute to the tense murder style of Hitchcock with Billy Wilder's cynicism of selfishness a la \"Double Indemnity\" plus Graham Greene-like, post-war politics from \"The Third Man\"-- and arms and oil dealers with military pasts in the Middle East are not outdated let alone adulterous lovers and rebellious teenagers. The film drips with sex and violence without actually showing either -- sensuous Jeanne Moreau walking through a long, rainy Paris night is enough to incite both. The black and white cinematography by Henri Deca\u00eb is breathtakingly beautiful in this newly struck 35 mm print, from smokey caf\u00e9s with ever watchful eyes like ours to the titular, ironic alibi's long shafts (which surely must have inspired a key, far paler scene in \"Speed\") to highway lights, to a spare interrogation box, but particularly in the street scenes. The coincidences and clues are built up, step by step, visually, including the final damning evidence. Miles Davis's improvisations gloriously and agitatedly burst forth as if pouring from the caf\u00e9s and radios, but the bulk of the film is startlingly silent, except for ambient sounds like rain that adds to the tension in the plot.The characters are archetypes -- the steely ex-Legonnaire, the James Dean and Natalie Wood imitators, the preening prosecutor -- that fit together in a marvelous puzzle. But all are cool besides Moreau's fire, as she dominates the look of the film, just wandering around Paris. There is some dialog that doesn't quite make sense at the end, but, heck, neither does \"The Big Sleep\" and this is at least in that league, if not higher in the pantheon.",

            "review_title": "naturalistic to a T, cool to the bone, atmosphere and suspense pay-off",
            "content": "I've only seen a couple of other of Louis Malle's films, but I'm sure I'll want to see more after getting to see this in its revival in theaters. It's an ironic, tense, a little aloof and engrossing thriller that plays on a couple of expectations if not all. At times I almost felt like I was watching a darker, dramatic French-noir version of Curb Your Enthusiasm; you're cringing in your seat at times because everything, at least for the first hour, seems realistic, and the inter-cutting between the three plot-lines (Julien in the elevator, Florence on the streets, the lovers-on-the-run at the Motel). You know something bad will happen, as par for the style Malle is working in (it's his first film, one can/can't tell if they didn't know beforehand). But it interested me, and kept me in my seat, how I knew things may unravel as they should in these films, and I found myself having to root for someone in a sea of anti-heroes.I mention Curb Your Enthusiasm as there is a sort of everyday occurrence that basically kicks off the plot (in tune with the genius title of the film), as Julien Tavaneur gets stuck in an elevator after getting rid of Florence Carala's rich husband (Moreau's character). Two kids, one more dangerous (if a little inexplicable, Louis) than the other, steal his car and stay at a Motel, where they meet a genial German tourist. Out of bad luck (as it is a running theme of the play), he kills the German, and things get more out of hand for everybody. In fact, the plot is rather thin, leaving room for a) suspense tenseness in the elevator scenes (and later in the interrogation scene, superbly lit), b) narrative musings by the calm Moreau, or c) troubles of the kids. These narratives are handled well, along with the typical police procedural, and it leads up to an ending that may not necessarily have a message to it. It can't be as pat as 'crime doesn't pay'. Moreau, in a classy close-up, says things that struck a chord with me, as did many parts of the film. It may be fate, as par for the naturalism, but is there something behind the cool veneer? The only downside for me was with the performance of the actor who played Louis. I didn't think he gave enough to what is indeed a rather small-minded character. The actress who plays his girlfriend fares fine, but he is one of the keys to the film, and I felt a little uneasy watching some of his scenes later on in the film. But still, any fault(s) I had with the film were minuscule when looking at how it is overall. This is one of those films that for pretty much the whole way through had me in its grip; I've rarely felt that watching a 'film-noir' before, but I did feel a very small kinship to another love/lust/cold-murder film, Blood Simple, which leaped off of some of the conventions we all know and admire in these films.And the contribution from Miles Davis, who is to 'cool' as the Beatles are to love & peace, can't be over-estimated. If Moreau gives the film a kind of downtrodden, wandering and wondering soul, and Malle gives the right look of the film with the great Henri (Le Samourai) Decae as DP, Davis backs up everything else. Sometimes his fast, overwhelming notes come through (mostly as on-the-set background music), and his slower music is landmark stuff, but what's surprising is that he can also add suspense, like to the elevator and interrogation scenes, and the mood is inescapable. I wouldn't be surprised if more than a few filmmakers who saw this film were inspired by Malle's use of free-flow jazz to add to the 'cool-ness' of the picture (not that he was the first of course, but it can be spotted in many films, in particular Herrmann's score for Taxi Driver). I have a feeling this may be the kind of film that will play better on multiple viewings, and for now I'm content to say it was a very well-spent trip.",

            "review_title": "Malle's Atmospheric Debut Made Resonant by Moreau's Haunting Presence and Davis's Jazz Score",
            "content": "Louis Malle was all of 25 when he made his directorial debut with this 1958 noirish thriller that also serves as a morality play. Using the elevator of the title as a vehicle for his leitmotif, he does an admirable job of capturing the smoky gray atmosphere of Paris in the 1950's and using it to great cinematic effect on a chain-link story of deception and murder. In fact, the whole movie plays like a Francophile version of a James M. Cain novel times two with plot twists coming in quick and sometimes contrived succession. To its credit, the brief 92-minute running time trots by quickly given the multiple story lines.The labyrinth story focuses first on illicit lovers Florence Carala, the restless wife of a corrupt arms dealer, and Julien Tavernier, a former war hero working for Florence's husband. There is not a wasted moment as they plot her husband's murder, but of course, things go awry with a forgotten piece of evidence and a running car ready to be taken. An amoral young couple, sullen and resentful Louis and free-spirited Veronique, enter the scene tangentially and get caught up in their own deceptions with a boisterous German couple whom they meet through a fender bender. The plot strands meander somewhat and eventually come together in a climax that has all the characters confronting the harsh reality of their past actions. There is a particular poignancy in the photos Florence sees at the end since we have no indication of the depth of emotion between the lovers otherwise.Malle, along with co-screenwriter Roger Nimier, presents an interesting puzzle full of irony and chance events, but there is a periodic slackness to the suspense, for instance, Florence's endlessly despondent walk though nocturnal Paris. Jazz great Miles Davis contributes a fitting hipster score, though the music is not as big an element as I expected in setting the mood. With her sorrowful eyes and pouting intelligence, Jeanne Moreau makes a vivid impression as Florence and gives her obsessed character the necessary gravitas to make her journey worthy of our interest. Maurice Ronet effectively plays Julien like a coiled spring throughout, and it's intriguing to note how most of his performance takes place in an immobilized elevator. As Louis and Veronique, Georges Poujuloy and the especially pixyish Yori Bertin are the forerunners for the runaway pair in Jean-Luc Godard's \"Breathless\" replete with youthful angst and mercenary cool.The print transfer on the 2006 Criterion Collection DVD package is wonderfully pristine. The first disc also contains the original and 2005 re-release trailers, though there is surprisingly no scholarly audio commentary track (the usual bonus for a Criterion release). The second disc, however, makes up for it with a bevy of extras starting with an extensive 1975 early career retrospective interview with Malle, a 2005 interview with an aged but still haunting Moreau, and a joint interview with the two icons and one-time lovers at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival.Three shorts on the second disc focus on Davis's contribution - the six-minute \"The Record Session\" shot the night Davis and his musicians recorded the score; a remembrance piece with pianist Rene Utreger, the only surviving member of Davis's ensemble; and the celebratory \"Miles Goes Modal: The Breakthrough Score to Elevator to the Gallows\" where jazz trumpeter Jon Faddis and music critic Gary Giddins discuss Davis's influence over the generation of musicians to come. There is also a short by Malle set to Charlie Parker's \"Crazeology\" and an informative 25-page photo essay booklet.",

He kills the man, but when he gets in the car he sees the rope hanging from the barrier he used as a foothold. He goes back in the building, gets on the elevator, but the security guy turns off the power to the building, trapping him between floors, where her stays. Meanwhile, a young punk and his empty headed girlfriend steal his car. Now he will be blamed for anything these two do.

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. The phrase Film Noir conjures up a certain feel and look and \"Gallows\" certainly captures what we have come to expect from the genre. However, the great director Louis Malle goes even further with his minimalistic approach to sound, lighting and dialog. Where 1944's \"Double Indemnity\" wreaks explosive on screen passion, Malle offers up a quiet simmering that draws the viewer into the lives of the main characters.Jeanne Moreau is the perfect pouty French femme fatale. Her scenes of walking (wandering) the dark, rainy streets of Paris are chilling to watch for film lovers. The weak lighting and lack of make-up allow Moreau's true emotions to guide us. Malle also is tremendous in his filming of the elevator scenes with Maurice Ronet.The secondary characters of the young lovers played by Yori Bertin (Veronique) and George Poujouly (Louis) are unmistakable in their likeness to Natalie Wood and James Dean. Watching two young kids carelessly destroy their own lives, as well as that of others, is quite the contrast to the well-conceived scheme of Moreau and Ronet.I have not been able to come up with an apt description of the powerfully improvised jazz score from the legendary Miles Davis. The approach has been mimicked over the years, but never duplicated. It is startling in its ability to slap the viewer in the face! Moreau is of course a screen legend and went on to star in \"Jules and Jim\", Truffaut's \"The Four Hundred Blows\" and my personal favorite, \"The Bride Wore Black\". As great as she was in all of these, I am not sure her essence was ever better captured than her wandering through the Paris streets in \"Elevator to the Gallows\".",

Malle put Moreau under an honest light and wisely let his camera linger. The film was nothing special, but it did accomplish one thing: it proposed a new ideal of cinematic realism, a new way to look at a woman. All the drama in the story was in Moreau's face \u2013 the face that had been hidden behind cosmetics and flattering lights in all her earlier films.\" Farrell is certainly right about the portrayal of Moreau. How can you make a leading lady anything but glamorous? Malle found a way that was quite successful.As for the film being \"nothing special\", I think Farrell is wrong. A 1950s French film noir that is well executed? This is something we need more of. Starting with a murder and then spreading out from there, this is a good story of suspense, intrigue and all that. The whole concept of being caught in an elevator is incredible, and probably unprecedented.",

It has reasonable human motivation and plot, and is steadily revealed. But, it is the study of 'being in the wrong place at the wrong time' that makes this film a classic. The series of chance events that will dramatically effect the characters' lives, give this film a similar feel to 'Run Lola Run' or 'Irreversible', dispute this film's linear structure and age.

            "content": "\"Ascenseur pour l'echafaud\" was Louis Malle's first film. It's strange that the man that showed a natural talent for telling a crime story in a somewhat unusual way, didn't go back to the genre in his interesting and distinguished career as a director. The timing was right, the film came out in 1958. It was followed by \"Les Amants\", which proved he was a force to be reckoned with.The director adapted a novel by Noel Calef that presented a classic situation for these types of crime films. A young and beautiful woman married to an rich older man who finds herself passionately in love with a younger man that works for her husband. The old man has to be eliminated if the lovers are to aspire to a life together.Julien Tavernier, the young man, plans and executes the crime that appears to be flawless. Stupidly, he overlooks a piece of rope he has left hanging from an the upstairs floor. As he does that, he is about to leave to meet Florence Carala, his lover, at a cafe on Boulevard Hausmann. As he goes back to take care of his mistake, the janitor stops the elevator that is carrying him upstairs. What to do? In the meantime, a young punk and petty criminal, Louis, who is picking up his girlfriend, Veronique, sees Julien has left the keys in the convertible car, plus his raincoat. He decides to take a joy ride. Florence, who happens to be looking to the street sees the car go by, but she notices there is a woman on the passenger's side. Florence decides to look for him.This intensely satisfying crime film was given a great treatment by an inspired Louis Malle and he was blessed to have Jeanne Moreau to portray Florence. Louis Malle, like the directors that were arriving on the scene of the French cinema were impressed by the American crime and film noir genre, they discussed in magazines. These crop of new directors wanted to revolutionize the narrative and create a different way to present their stories. The streets of Paris became the backdrop to the movies that will follow.What Louis Malle created was a moody film that tells a lot about the mind of the criminals as they are going through the anxieties of knowing what they had done and thinking how they would get away with the horrible crime they had committed. On the one hand, Julien, is the victim of Louis and Veronique, as they steal the convertible, only to get into trouble themselves. Florence's state of mind is right there on the screen, in front of us, as she roams the streets of Paris trying to make sense of what happened to Julien.Jeanne Moreau gives an impeccable performance as Florence. We watch her as she goes from being sure of herself, to suddenly realizing she is defeated. What's more, in a ironic twist, her confession to the police will work against Julien, instead of helping him. She also incriminates herself in ways she never suspected when the candid pictures on a forgotten camera are developed. Jeanne Moreau is nothing short of fabulous.Maurice Ronet, doesn't have the flashy opportunity in which to shine as does his co-star. His Julien is a man that wants to have it all, but he makes serious mistakes along the way. Georges Poujouly is seen as the petty criminal Louis who passes himself as Julien Tavernier. Charles Denner and Lino Ventura, who will go to bigger and better things later on in their respective careers are excellent, especially Mr. Ventura as the inspector Cherier, who figures the whole mystery.This film was the debut of a man who went to do great work in his native France and have a second career in America. What distinguishes this film from others of the genre is the jazzy score by Miles Davis, whose music blends perfectly with the images one sees. The cinematography by Henri Decae shows us a nocturnal Paris far from the touristy places most directors love to present. Paris, as a backdrop, is what makes this film the joy it is to watch.",

            "content": "No need to recap the plot. The movie really represents a triumph of form over content. Seldom have I seen a smoother technique than director Malle shows here. The transition from scene to scene is almost seamless and keeps the viewer engaged regardless what's developing plot-wise. Then too, Decae's camera work shows how compelling natural lighting can be. The overall effect is one of effortless fluidity, a style well suited to lyrical subjects.The trouble is the material itself is better suited to Hollywood B-movie techniques. In short, the material is jagged, while Malle's style is smooth, resulting unfortunately in a thriller drained of inherent drama. Note, for example, the elevator sequence, a predicament fairly bursting with suspenseful potential. Yet Malle's style does little to heighten the implicit desperation and even cuts away (though smoothly) from the mounting tension. To be fair, Ronet (Tavernier) adds nothing by remaining impassive throughout. (Perhaps paratroopers never sweat.) Thus the movie's dramatic centerpiece flattens out into just one more event among many.Then there are the various misadventures of the free-spirited kids. They look cuddly, but remain amoral cyphers throughout, their double homicide coming across again as just one more event, no more important than Florence's (Moreau) dispirited walk up the avenue. In fact, the one time Malle highlights with his camera is that lengthy trudge through Paris, a director clearly fascinated by Moreau's distinctive appearance. Again, the style is smooth and polished, but also highly impersonal and homogenizing. I kept wishing one of Hollywood's noir masters like Nicholas Ray or Billy Wilder had gotten hold of the material first.No need to go on apart from Malle about a sloppy script with its number of plot holes helpfully cited by other reviewers, or about overlooked details like a bullet to the head that raises no blood. All in all, I wonder how many folks would celebrate the film if it were not from France with Malle's name on it. Apart from its influence on French cinema, the movie does not wear well over time. Moreover, given the style he shows here, it's no surprise to me that Malle's breakthrough movie would be titled The Lovers rather than this over-civilized slice of thick ear.",

He's stuck.Meanwhile, two young people, an impulsive, cagey young man and his girlfriend from a flower shop (Georges Poujouly, Yori Bertin) steal Tavernier's fancy car and take off.Fabulous noir set in rainy France with captivating scenery and Miles Davis music, perfectly catching the atmosphere - Moreau, not knowing where Tavernier is, walking in the rain, going from bar to bar trying to find him; the two young lovers on an adventure, the girl with a romantic, Juliet-like attitude, the boy headstrong; Tavernier, smoking in the elevator as he works on how to get out; people still talking of the Occupation and war in Algiers...Malle weaves a fascinating story of fate and random circumstance.There isn't a lot of dialogue in this film, but the actions say it all. Paris in the rain and suspense - it doesn't get much better.",

            "content": "Ever since hearing a number of critics widely praise films from the French New Wave I have always gotten a feeling of intimidation and inaccessibility from the wide group of films due to how most of the mainstream critics seem to constantly try and put the New Wave films in a special box just for themselves.After having become completely fascinated by tremendous \"genre\" films from Italy and Sweden,I started to look over at the New Wave films from France and began to feel that I should completely tear down the wall of intimidation around them by jumping straight into one of the first ever French New Wave films made that also starred one of the most famous (and most loved) actresses from the periodView on the film:For his eye-catching directing of what is one of the first French New Wave films, Louis Malle (who also wrote the screenplay adaptation of Noel Calef's novel with Roger Nimer)starts the new era off with a \"bang\", as the film opens on a extreme close up of a beautiful Jeanne Moreau.One of the very best decisions that Malle made was to show Moreau's face with no make up on at all,which along with allowing Moreau to give Florencea a real femme fatale edge, who is more than ready to walk through the shadows of the city to catch the smallest glimpse of her murdering lover,which is linked by Moreau in an elegant performance, as she shows Florence to go from being self assured of her and Julian's murder plot,to shivering with fear as Florence realises that the situation has gotten completely out of her control.Whilst Moreau unforgettable face does open this fantastic film,the rest of the cast easily deserve equal praise,with the sadly under rated Maurice Ronet giving a terrific performance as Julian Tavernier who along with showing a chilling precision of executing the murder is also able to show an increase feeling of dread as the walls of the lift start to close in on him as his fear of getting found really starts to take its toll on him,and also gives the audience of great sense of isolation.After opening his New Wave Film Noir on a stunning shot and a rolling score from Miles Davis, Malle brilliantly creates a world of darkness as he goes from a truly edge of the seat,gripping murder sequence to making the city filled with wonderful characters who go from an edgy teenage rebel who steals a car from under everyone's nose,to a cop,who like the audience finds the activates of Florence and Julian something that he will never forget.",

            "content": "One of the big problems with Louis Malle's debut feature was the two lovers who plot a murder together never interact with one another except over the phone.The film has a clever premise but fails to build enough suspense by film's end. Former paratrooper Julien Tavernier (Maurice Ronet) has fallen in love with his boss's wife Florence Carala (Jeanne Moreau). He climbs up to the top floor of his office building where he kills Florence's husband Simon (Jean Wall) and stages the murder to look like a suicide.The arrogant Simon, an arms dealer, doesn't see it coming as Julien kills him with his own gun. Julien now at street level, is about to drive off to meet Florence when he spies the rope he accidentally left dangling outside Simon's office which he used to climb up to the boss's office.Some internet posters complained how Julien could be so stupid to forget about the rope but hey, overlooking such a thing given the pressure Julien was under is entirely possible. Perhaps less convincing is that Julien could still be spotted from street level by passersby when he climbed from floor to floor.Those who have seen the film know the twist-that Julien gets stuck in the elevator over the weekend. Unfortunately, the main plot involving Julien's disappearance, his unsuccessful attempts to free himself from the elevator and Florence's failed attempt to locate Julien, all those dead spot machinations slow the story down (especially Florence going around and asking acquaintances of Julien if they've seen him).The sub-plot works better. Flower girl across the street V\u00e9ronique (Yori Bertin) spinelessly joins her juvenile delinquent boyfriend Louis (George Poujoulay) when he decides to go for a joyride in Julien's car (after Julien had left the motor running right before returning to retrieve the errant rope and getting trapped in the elevator).Louis proves to be the French equivalent of Charles Starkweather who was accompanied by a teenage girlfriend and committed a string of murders in the badlands area of Nebraska and Wyoming beginning right before Elevator to the Gallows was released.Here Louis kills only a total of two German tourists. One finds it odd that the German tourist is so jovial at first after Louis intentionally rams into his Mercedes Benz in front of the motel where the two couples end up staying the night.In some ways \"Elevator\" may have worked better as a black comedy. Case in point: the failed suicide of the two teenagers.The ultimate irony occurs when Julien is arrested at first for the murder of the German tourists. The police don't believe his story he was trapped in the elevator because Louis used Julien's gun to kill the tourists.Moreau finally gets to do a little acting when she follows Louis to the photo developer where incriminating pictures of Louis and V\u00e9ronique are being developed.Quite unconvincingly, a child is shown earlier picking up the rope that Julien had forgot and was so desperately trying to retrieve before ending up trapped in the elevator (I thought it odd that the rope did not fall further away from the building).Worse yet, Police Commissaire Cherrier (played by iconic French actor Lino Ventura) no longer has the rope to tie Julien to Simon's murder.But fortunately for him, pictures of Julien and Florence embracing are found on the same role of film that incriminates the teenagers.It seemed a bit odd that the motel would have film developing store on the premises but perhaps it was commonplace in France at that time (I have no idea).Everything is tied up in a nice bow with all the criminals getting their just desserts.Some like Miles Davis's improvised jazz score which gives \"Elevator\" its film noir texture. For me a Bernard Hermann score would have been much better.If not for the plot holes and the dead spots, Malle's debut feature could have ended up closer to one of Alfred Hitchcock's more successful suspense thrillers. Some of it is clever but just not clever enough.",

He also made some good films that aren't life-changing but that show insight. This is one of them.There are no new ideas here. It unfolds as one expects. The drama is muted to the point of homeopathy.And yet we like it because it is so economical. Its bare, honest, true. So we like it, just like we gravitate to an open person regardless of whether she is dumb. I appreciate Bresson for this, his economy which blesses the viewer with a mind that necessarily filters what we see. But Bresson goes too far and presses into the impress of abstraction. Malle is real because it is overtly untheatrical.Its worth seeing because it is seamless bamboo and because it informs \"Vanya\" and \"Dinner.\" But in terms of its effect; its callow post-noir noir.

Brilliant though much of he early film is, after about an hour I found my attention waning and I began to muse on why a car would have been left with its engine running, why a lift would have been used when the building was about to be shut up, why you would sit and smoke in such an enclosed space?

            "content": "At the risk of sounding flippant, this film looks like something Hitchcock and Serling might have come up with had they collaborated. But the idea that a twenty four year old Louis Malle directed it makes me wonder how such a young film maker could have been so knowledgeable and worldly to pull it off. There's a lot of fine tension and irony in the picture, and the Miles Davis score has a way of hooking the viewer into a world that's furtively dishonorable.Yet there are some bothersome elements as well. The business with leaving the rope behind was just too big a blunder and struck me as completely out of character for a veteran like Tavernier (Maurice Ronet). Seeing it dangle from street level only added to the mystery of how Tavernier could possibly have remained unnoticed as he made his way to the upper floor in full view.Interestingly, what Malle does best here is the way he telegraphs the next twist in the story while making the viewer feel good about figuring it out. Tavernier leaves the car running so someone could take off with it, and sure enough, Louis does. Veronique uses the Tavernier name and the Benckers wind up with a murderer who makes the front page for one he didn't commit. Each step of the way you can pretty much figure out what will happen next, but at the same time it seems like a revelation when it occurs. I don't think I've ever seen anything like it.So, for a picture I'd never even heard of before, this turned out to be quite the find at my little town library this evening. The cinematography is gorgeous and Jeanne Moreau seduces the screen with all the noir fatalism one could ask for. With all the bad luck these characters created for themselves, I would have been disappointed if there were no black cat.",

After a strange and unreal telephone conversation on the matter, he gets right to work and everything seems to be going spiffy... until they don't. Then everything starts to go wrong.Honestly the only thing that sets this film apart from other film noir-type thrillers is an astounding score by Miles Davis and the fact that the lovers are separated throughout the entire film, unless you count the photos at the end, which are still by degrees separated from us. Actually, that's the strongest moment of the film, when that ideal dream the two shared seems a lot more reasonable than the loose and eccentric ravings of the woman as she goes on and on about her slightly obsessed love.Otherwise it's generally a pretty open guide to ineptitude. Here's where I disagree with Terrence Rafferty, writer of \"Louis Malle on the Ground Floor\", the essay in the booklet included in the Criterion Collection edition of this film. It's not \"bad luck\" to leave a rope hanging so that you have to go back to get it, it's pretty much just simply stupidity. Almost all of the characters suffer from an inability to think critically or resolve themselves to their situation, which is why everything just keeps falling apart.It's a fun movie, but--and I hate to say it in such crass terms--it's been done thousands of times before and after, and many times better. The pulp novel influence is clear, characters that we don't care about because they don't really have personality (except those completely unbelievable) run around doing stuff pretty much because they need to only to keep the plot going. If it wasn't for the complete lack of ability to think, all we'd have is a guy trapped in an elevator for nearly an hour and a half.--PolarisDiB",

            "content": "Ex-paratrooper Julien Tavernier sets up the perfect crime to kill his rich boss, who is also the husband of his mistress. Scaling up from his own office, Julien makes it look like suicide before climbing back down and publicly heading home for the night. Having forgotten to remove the rope, Julien runs back into the building as it is closing down but he gets stuck in the lift between floors. Meanwhile his car is stolen from outside the building by two youths and his mistress walks the streets waiting for news of their crime, wondering if he did it and if she will ever see him again.It took me a bit of time to get into the plot with this film, mainly because I was interested in the score that had been improvised by Miles Davis. Specifically the sections where Tavernier is trapped, the kids are cruising and the mistress is wandering \u0096 I thought these went on for a little too long without adding a great deal to the film. However at the start things move quite quickly into a series of chance events around the \"perfect crime\" (had Julien never seen Columbo?) and it isn't long before the irony of events is coming to light and the story starts to twist in an enjoyable fashion. The story may be, well, rather French but it is still quite gripping as a thriller because you're not sure where it is finally going to go and the conclusion was a good one even if it did have a few holes in it. The score is great of course but Miles Davis' doesn't play such a big part after the halfway point. The direction is good \u0096 very effective use of the black and whites with a mix of atmospheric tension and general grit in each scene.The cast are reasonably good but there was a touch too much Gaelic introspection for my liking where really I was looking for more depth and emotion. Moreau stands out because she has the lion's share of this aspect and she does do it pretty well. Ronet does provide a more interesting character because he does change over the film, but I did struggle to see the actors playing the kids as anything other than a subplot to bring the main story to an end.Overall this is a different film and I'm glad I watched it. The thriller plot plays out well despite a bit of wandering and vagueness in the middle but the first and final thirds are very enjoyable. The direction is good and the Miles Davis score just tops it all off. A bit slow and \"French\" for some tastes I'd wager but I enjoyed it.",

His motivation was never explained. The constant cutting to Tavernier failing to escape from the lift and Jeanne Moreau padding around Paris failing to find him did not help.This is a film that seems to seduce a lot of people with its incidentals \u0096 musical score, photography, etc. \u0096 although it lacks the most essential ingredient of a good thriller, viz., thrills.",

The setup has Julien killing his boss (faking a suicide) in order to run off with the boss' wife. Julien executes the murder at his work where his boss has an office one floor up. Telling his secretary not to disturb him, he goes outside on a ledge and, employing the old hook and rope trick, scales up to the upstairs floor and does the deed. Climbing a rope on the exterior of a building over a crowded Paris street in broad daylight did not convince me that Julien had thought things through very well or, more to the point, the screenwriters had not done their job. But then Julien climbs back down the rope to make his escape. My immediate reaction was, \"Wait, you left the rope there.\" It's not until Julien exits the building and gets in his car that he realizes how stupid he has been and goes back in to remove the rope. It was not at all clear how he was going to do that, but then he got stuck in an elevator on the way up so we don't see that.Unfortunately this rather implausible set-up establishes the tone for the rest of the movie. A young couple steals Julien's car and in one of the most absurd scenes they dent the Mercedes of a wealthy German couple. The German's reaction is, \"Hey, what a hoot, come on in and have some drinks with us.\" Murders, attempted suicides, mistaken identities, and unbelievable coincidences ensue, leading to a scripted ending.As much as I like Jeanne Moreau, she does little here beyond walking around in existential despair, occasionally vocalizing how much she loves Julien. She can also walk through a downpour without mussing her hair. A nice jazz score provided by Miles Davis accentuates the mood of ennui.",

A real showcase for French cinema icon Jeanne Moreau (this was right before The 400 Blows, La Notte, and Jules et Jim) as the wife of a war profiteer (with a company that manufactures product for war) in love with his employee, Julien (Maurice Ronet). Julien and Moreau's Florence have plotted supposedly the perfect murder, a sure-fire suicide setup that appears fool-proof...but is it ever? Leaving the rope and hook that helped Julien get to the floor with the boss' office, he returns to retrieve it but is trapped in the elevator when a fellow employee cuts off the power before locking the gate to the building. Florence believes he has instead left her for another woman, a teenage flower shop girl, seen in the passenger seat of his car (stolen by her hoodlum boyfriend in a leather jacket) as it passes. The rest of the night, Florence spends walking the streets of Paris (luridly and excitingly photographed by Henri Decae (he'd go on to photograph the masterpiece, Le Samourai for Jean-Pierre Melville)) while searching for Julien, running into his drunk war friend instead. Moreau's vulnerable performance, all that angst and rejection, the turmoil and devotion, is masterfully presented warts and all. She's magnificent. And, despite the reports that Malle had her with no makeup much to the dismay of his crew, she's so beautiful and elegant, Moreau is never \"ugly\" or at all less than stunning. Yet she's emotionally exposed and there's even a scene or two where she's so caught up in her own headspace, her Florence walks into traffic, yet not a single car even glosses a breeze upon her. Meanwhile the flower shop girl and her crook boyfriend get all hot at a German couple in a Mercedes zooming past them while in Julien's stolen car, soon meeting them for champagne and conversation at a Parisian motel. When the stupid kid goes to steal the German's car, he knew ahead of time, calling him on it, with the result being a haphazard dual murder, with the teenagers fleeing the crime scene. The German couple dead, with the hood taking Julien's name, he's framed for their murders, yet the whole night he was trapped in the elevator! The elevator situation involved Julien trying to find a way out, nearly being killed while hanging outside it when a security guard momentarily turned on the power!A camera found in Julien's car, by the flower shop girl as she takes a few pictures of the Germans could be their undoing, with Florence doing all she can to save her true love. Just a year before Breathless, you could consider \"Elevator to the Gallows\" a precursor to the French New Wave movement that took Paris by storm in the 60s. The noirish look and mood, with that vocal jazz score, and the domino effect that results from the initial crime conducted by Julien makes Malle's cinematic debut a must see for fans of his later work and the French New Wave that came after. Malle's film here is a knockout. A model for how Paris is captured in all its busy and active naturality, Malle delivers a strong story with multiple ongoing subplots, soon converging. Moreau as the anchor is the right choice.",

We can measure the power of their love by the promptness with which he puts on gloves, takes a gun and climbs his way to his boss' office, his boss Mr. Carala (Simon Wall) is his mistress' husband. Hitchcock recommended to shoot \"crimes like love scenes\" but Malle shoots his crime as an act of love. Still, Julien (Maurice Ronet) is surprisingly passionless for a supposedly crime of passion, maybe because the passion is within Florence (Moreau) and Carala is the last formality to get over.There seems to be some history between the two men, both French Foreign Legion veterans paratroopers, Julien made his bones and Carala money, there's a tacit respect that can't hide Julien's resentment, we see immediately that Julien won't feel any remorse and so does Carala, when he can spot the hatred in his murderer's eyes, his arrogance fades out as quickly as light from a candle. But we don't even have to see his murder, as to foreshadow that it won't be any highlight of the day, he's killed off-screen, casually, anti-climactically. And Julien manages to sneak away, using his knife to lock the office's door from outside, and leaves the building with two witnesses. It's the perfect crime and one hell of a beginning.Now, this is the trickiest part of the film, what do you make up when such a perfect crime is followed by such a stupid mistake? Julien starts his car, a classy convertible Chevrolet and then notices the accusing rope hanging between the two balconies. This is not a plot contrivance, this is just absurdity teasing existentialism, just when Julien thought his life had but one direction: Florence, the lousiest but so touchingly human mistake takes him back to the scene of crime. This omission reveals that you can screw people, but not destiny if it decided to screw you. I mentioned Bob le Flambeur earlier, Julien's omission reminded me of Bob's winning streak the very day he wanted to rob the casino. Life can be such a bitch.But Malle doesn't even let us time to analyze this streak of bad luck, the mistake of Julien is immediately overshadowed by the resulting chain of events. Julien gets to the elevator and it all goes so fast, the caretaker shut the power off and he finds himself entrapped for the night. Meanwhile, a young flower shop assistant gets ready for her weekend with Louis, a young thug, played by a James-Dean like George Poujouly, the boy from \"Forbidden Games\". Louis can't resist the temptation of stealing Julien's car, call it instinct but he feels that he won't come back any sooner. Meanwhile (again), Florence waits for Julien in a caf\u00e9, she sees the car leaving and recognizes the flower shop girl, believing Julien is the driver, she begins a melancholic and sad walk through Parisian streets, punctuating the riveting two-lane thriller.The film is driven by a Jazz score from Miles Davis and the sad allure of Jeanne Moreau staggering down Paris with the street lamps reflected on her face, she's not the glamorous lover, not a femme fatale, but a woman obviously hurt by love and deception, entrapped in a life with no meaning since her lover failed her. The very irony is that the lover himself is entrapped and tries to get his way out of the elevator, condemned to stay powerless while at the same time, the young couple will meet a couple of innocent German tourists and another interference with Karma will lead to Louis shooting both of them. Basically, Julien has acted by proxy, thus becoming guilty of a murder he didn't commit while trying to cover the one he made, the height of irony is that he risks death penalty with the second one.No one would believe the elevator excuse, and yet Julien can't admit his crime since no one knows about his relationship with Florence. The film reaches the delightful point where you think he'll give away his own alibi and admit one murder because at least, he had a motive. But the Police, lead by a young and confident Lino Ventura doesn't believe his story. At that point, any resolution would do, it plays under the rules of hazard and reality, it's not about what you do, but how they stand on the field of common sense. It all comes down to the kind of resolutions that might seem contrived but work nonetheless.The German couple took pictures with Julien's camera and put them to a lab, not only the pictures incriminated Louis but they betrayed Julien, revealing romantic pictures with Florence. The film came full circle with the opening declaration, showing a crime driven by love, and lovers driven to crime, you can feel hints of \"Breathless\" in the film but Malle's film works even better in my opinion. Indeed, Malle doesn't care for effect, his movie is about the total unpredictability of life, in the name of love, when people do things they can't control, but by doing so, things get out of their own control. Like Florence, we couldn't know about the pictures so we couldn't see them coming.And that's the stuff, great film-making is made of.",

He commits the absolutely most perfect murder imaginable, and then a telephone call makes him forget one detail, and when he tries to remedy his mistake he is caught in an elevator between two storeys and can't get out! And that's only the introductory plot to a web of plots or rather an inextricable mess of misfortunes...There are altogether four criminals and three murders committed, only one planned and three just slipping into it by circumstances. Jeanne Moreau is always perfect in wicked roles, there is a certain trait around her mouth which makes her hopelessly and incurably look cruel, her laugh is never convincing, and she has no sense of humour. That'\u00a8s what's generally lacking in French films, which is why they are best at making sinister films, like this one, \"Les yeux sans visage\", \"Les diaboliques\" and other hopelessly dark thrillers, of which this is another one and definitely one of the very best in its grey tristesse and filmed almost exclusively in sterile surroundings - that's the dominant character of almost all French films of the Nouvelle Vague, which makes them slightly inhuman. This is more human, since it's a crime passionnel it's all about, and the youths are just humanly stupid and actually try to commit suicide for their offence.Maurice Ronet is always expressionless and here more than ever - a total poker face, having nothing else to do but to submit to his bleak destiny - not even the smartest murder in the world could save him here.Miles Davis' dark jazz underscores the d\u00e9faitism of the thriller by being mostly silent but for some poignant reminders to add some acuteness to the dreary mood. It's a brilliant film, the first of many by Louis Malle, most of them equally hopeless, like the dreadful suicide study \"Le feu follet\"(also with Maurice Ronet), but this is only his second best film. His best film remains his very odd and different collaboration with Jacques-Yves Costeau in \"The Silent World\", which is also his most human film.",

There's a seriously cool vibe to this French new wave meets film noir drama, and it's a pretty impressive feature film debut for Louis Malle, who was just 26.The setup is that a man having an affair with a married woman (Maurice Ronet and Moreau) plot to kill her husband. Things don't go exactly as planned, and as they unravel, there are three distinct threads, each of which is part of a taut, unpredictable story. Without spoiling it, it's interesting that his character is mistaken for an infidelity by the person he's committing infidelity with, and that he's mistaken for a murder other than the one he's committed.While how it'll come together is probably somewhat apparent, who cares? This film has such a beautiful mood to it. Malle, Moreau, and Miles ... there is a lot of genius in these three, each in their own way, and it's on full display. 1958 was a fantastic year for this actor and director pair, as they also made 'The Lovers' together, which is another great film.A quote, from the small references in the film to French imperialism, which were a nice little bonus:\n\"Don't sneer at war. It's your bread and butter. Indochina netted you how much? And now Algeria. Have some respect for war. It's your family heirloom.\"",

The stark cinematography and Davis's jazzy score lend the film a sense of immediacy that is well suited to the storyline.

It looks like there might be a few clever twists but they never come, no, the clever cops work it all out and the silly chumps leave incriminating photos to seal their fate and by the way, who took the photos anyway? I hardly think they had selfies in those days, especially not on a spy camera, but rather indiscreet nonetheless considering the circumstances. However, justice is done, the bad guys get theirs and that's that. There is none of the moral ambiguity, nihilism or hopelessness that true masterpieces of the genre like Scarlet Street, Kiss Me Deadly or The Third Man have in spades. This plays out more like a routine episode of Colombo with all loose ends nicely tied up, thank you very much. A real disappointment.",

And the plot, with all its surprises and twists, is great. The only thing that will strike a lot of us, especially those used to American crime films, is a lack of believability now and then--a reaction, or actual decision, that just isn't quite right.You can write this all off to style, and that's good enough because it's just being in the movie that is rewarding. The plot will get you going, and with each odd turn, people left out and others killed so incidentally it's a surprise, you are really caught up wondering what is next. Louis Malle directed a number of distinctive films (including another from 1958, The Lovers, again starring Jeanne Moreau), and they precede and later parallel the French New Wave films which are a little looser and grittier than his. Elevator to the Gallows is a film noir of sorts, though with a very French, lyrical quality. And an odd lack of hero, as you'll see.

            "content": "This represents an astonishing solo directorial debut by any standards and although Louis Malle had co-directed 'le Monde du Silence', it was working as assistant director on 'A Man Escaped' that was to have the most lasting effect and the Bressonian influence is there for all to see.He has chosen to adapt a 'pulp' novel by Henri Calef but rather than 'spoof' the genre in the manner of Godard and Truffaut, he has respected its traditions and given us un hommage whilst enriching the material in terms of psychological depth and heightening the tension with unmistakeable Hitchcockian touches.The film has achieved iconic status for the luminous night shooting by Henri Decae, particularly the sequence in which the forlorn Jeanne Moreau wanders the streets of Paris in search of Maurice Ronet to the accompaniment of Miles Davis' haunting score, by all accounts improvised during a screening of the film.The main murder plot is complemented by the tragic misadvenures of the rebellious youths played by George Poujouly and Yori Bertin whose characters could be seen as prototypes for Michel and Patricia in Godard's 'Bout du Souffle'.This proved to be a turning point in the careers of Mlle Moreau and Monsieur Ronet. The latter was to be gifted his finest role as the alcoholic writer in 'Feu Follet' five years later for the same director whilst the former, already a veteran of twenty films unknown outside France, was launched into international stardom. Under Louis Malle's sensitive direction everything comes together for her at the age of twenty-nine and the camera captures her toughness, pathos and incredible sensuality. It comes as no surprise that by the time they made their next film together, the appropriately named 'Les Amants', director and star had eyes only for each other.",

With this in mind, Elevator to the Gallows has to be considered something worth a viewing. Like many others in the New Wave, the influence of the British director Alfred Hitchcock is not too far from the surface in what is essentially a crime thriller. More specifically, this one could be more usefully categorised as a French neo-noir which has a plot typical of this bracket of film with a story propelled by a woman and her lover scheming to murder her husband. This plot point is dealt with quite quickly and early though and it is the fall-out of this crime which is what the film is really about, with the excellent central conceit of the murderer trapped in an elevator one which is highly distinctive. The film essentially is made up of two connected crime stories of young lovers, the older of which are the two whose actions kick-start the plot and who never physically meet throughout the course of the story, while the other two are that new staple of 50's cinema, juvenile delinquents. It's an interesting story, with some nice twists and turns. It looks splendid too, with scenic views of 50's Paris doing it no harm at all. Not only this but it also is fortunate enough to sport an improvised score from jazz legend Miles Davis, which perfectly enhances the urban melancholy unfolding on screen.",

            "content": "Boasting a jazz score by the legendary Miles Davis, Louis Malle's \"Elevator to the Gallows\" is a moody film noir starring Maurice Ronet as Julien Tavernier, an office worker who murders a wealthy industrialist. Why? To be with the victim's wife of course.This is a plot typical of film noirs. What complicates the film is this: the victim is a war criminal who profited off France's many colonialist occupations (specifically in Algeria and Indochina). Julien, meanwhile, is a war hero and former parachutist who sees his kill as a form of poetic justice. This is a noir, however, and so Julien's best laid plans swiftly go awry. Pretty soon he finds himself trapped in an elevator and so caged at the very site of his crime. His predicament is inter-cut with the adventures of two kids in love, Louis and Veronica, who steal Julien's car and assume his identity. With this stollen identity comes another crime: the duo shoot to death two German tourists. To exonerate himself of the duo's crime, Julien must thus implicate himself in his own crime. Where are the police in all of this? Confused as hell.Malle then engages in another, largely symbolic sub-plot. Here Julien represents the men of the inter-war years, idealised, mythologised and touted as noble heroes. Louis, meanwhile, becomes indicative of post-war youths, living in the shadow of the War and envious of the nationally recognised achievements of those who came before. To assuage such feelings, Louis assumes Julien's identity and unconsciously becomes a WW2 soldier, and even goes so far as to kill two Germans on French soil with Julien's pistol. It's not only that Louis eventually realises what the sanctified image of Julien really represents, like Julien's own realisations with regard to his boss, but that both Julien and Louis find themselves unable to stop killing. The war makes a murderer out of one, and forces the other to kill out of fear of exclusion.\"Elevator to the Gallows\" co-stars Jeanne Moreau, who famously acted in Truffaut's \"Jules and Jim\". Its moody, noirish cinematography was by Henri Decae, who turns elevators into prisons and city streets into hypnotic shadow-worlds (Decae also shot Melville's \"Bob the Gambler\" and \"The Samurai\").7.9/10 - One of Malle's best.

Some parts of the story may seem a bit overdone in order to demonstrate the unpredictability of other actors involved but on the other hand the movie hardly ever loses its style and it's this style that excels. When beautiful Jeanne Moreau, in her despair of supposed betrayed love, is walking alone the nightly streets of Paris accompanied by the fine jazz tunes of Miles Davis then it feels like contemplating a valuable piece of art.It is also true that the side story of the young couple borrowing the car of Mr. Tavernier is a bit awkward and not too persuasive but on the other hand the play of young flower-girl Veronique is really impressive. What an outgoing and enthusiastic but weak and shy character at the same time. I am sure even today's teenagers could relate to her.Moreover, the movie is not simply a crime story but also has its social and political statements. The victim of the planned murder (next to an unplanned murder) is an unscrupulous arms-dealer who has his connections into the highest political ranks. This does not provide a favorable picture of a post war France, which is even worsened by the submissive and hypocritical behavior that great parts of society show towards this influential man. Only drunkard Mr. Subervie is naming him the right way and by doing so he even stresses the hypocrisy surrounding him.Last but not least Lino Ventura gives a cool and pragmatic detective, a role he should become famous for in his career. The police questioning scene in the dark with the two detectives interrogating Maurice Ronnet for a crime he has not committed is another highlight of the movie.",

Florence (Moreau) and Julien (Ronet) are two lovers out of wedlock, the only barrier is Florence's senescent but wealthy husband Simon (Wall), for whom Julien works as a corporate clerk, they diligently hatch a plot to get rid of Simon and make the pretense as a suicide scene. The scheme is executed according to the schedule until a last-moment hiccup (Julien forgets the damn rope on the roof), a black cat is always ominous, just when he returns to the company building to fetch it, Julien is accidentally left alone in the elevator. Meanwhile, a pair of youngster Louis and V\u00e9ronique (Poujouly and Bertin) lift Julien's posh car for a wild ride, en route, a harebrained Louis shot a German couple in a motel using the identity of Julien. The same night, Florence is aimlessly roaming around the streets of Paris, looking for her absent lover! Things will get messier the next morning when Julien gets out of the elevator, he is wanted by the police and Florence starts to get a grip on the entire misidentified situation, after a concise confrontation with Louis and V\u00e9ronique, a few developed photographs reveal the real culprits of both homicides, the star-crossed lovers meet their comeuppance as well as the hotheaded Louis.Logically speaking, its 88 minutes running time seems a bit sketchy for clarifying the police's investigation procedure and there are a flew negligible plot holes dangling (e.g. how the rope without a trace appears at the entrance of the building is never explained), obviously they are not Malle's first choice. The picture is mostly preeminent for the bounteous close-ups to examine his then lover Moreau's emotive visage (under a plain make-up free naturalism) with her inner voice-over, equally impressively is the Black & White shots of the night view on the expressway and in the interrogation part under a pitch-black background, it is a conflation of Film-Noir with a budding La Nouvelle Vague. My personal recommendation is a heart-in-the- mouth set piece for the acrophobic when Julien tries to scale down from the elevator when it abruptly descends, Ronet is solely in his prime and later his mojo would be evoked unconditionally in Malle's THE FIRE WITHIN (1963, 9/10). Two thumbs up to Malle for his immense dexterity in such an incipient stage of his career. One can also find some scattered fun in the film, such as the chic vehicle or the gizmos of a spy camera or the telephone-cum-pencil-sharpener, certainly for me they are eye-openers. Let's not forget Miles Davis' saxophone-heavy score, downright impromptu, but tallies with the film impeccably! A more on-topic note is the alert message \"never leave photos around\", if only everyone could have watched this film before we reached this epoch of selfie fever, the world would be a bit less tumultuous indeed.",

All goes apparently well, until Mr. Ronet realizes he left his \"grappling hook\" behind. This is the hooked rope Ronet uses to climb from his office's floor to the victim's floor. In hindsight, director Louis Malle should have instructed Ronet to simply use the stairs. In any case, Ronet leaves the engine of his fancy, illegally parked convertible running while he dashes up to retrieve the grappling hook. Alas, the building's power is turned off for the weekend, leaving Ronet trapped in an elevator near the scene of his crime...And, that's not all...Outside the office building, flower shop clerk Yori Bertin (as Veronique) is visited by her juvenile delinquent boyfriend Georges Poujouly (as Louis), preening in his new leather jacket. Looking to upgrade from his stolen scooter, Mr. Poujouly decides to steal Ronet's fancy automobile. He and an initially reluctant Ms. Bertin take the convertible for a joyride which turns deadly. While they get into mischief and murder, Ronet tries to get of the elevator trap. Meanwhile, looking beautiful in Henri Decae's moody black-and-white photography, Ms. Moreau wanders around Paris looking for Ronet. She may have less to do than the others, but director Malle so lovingly follows Moreau as Miles Davis music plays, you savor her every step and close-up...Some of the plot developments are implausible, but not impossible...However, there is one very noteworthy defect; it is the aforementioned grappling hook...There are several questions raised by this device, which is used by Ronet to go from his floor to the floor of his prospective victim. Later, he realizes he forgot to retrieve the hook. The mishap occurs when his telephone rings, but most people would get the phone, then the hook. Ronet doesn't recall the hook until seeing it dangling from the office building, while getting into his getaway car. Still, later, it falls by itself and is picked up by a passing girl. Well, the black cat we see earlier could have dislodged the hoot, if the cat could jump floors. The main problem with all of this is that Ronet does the climbing in broad daylight, in full view of Paris. And, even if nobody looks up, there are thousands of Parisians who would see him from their sitting room windows.******** Elevator to the Gallows (1/29/58) Louis Malle ~ Jeanne Moreau, Maurice Ronet, Georges Poujouly, Yori Bertin",

He makes one mistake, the rope, but this is is resolved for him (improbably), and yet, in the end, the police conclude that he killed Mr. Carala.\n* In the end, we also see pictures of Julien and Florence, supposedly selfies, but that's clearly impossible, since they are taken out of arms reach, and with a tiny spy camera that doesn't have a timing trigger. Who took them? Well, no one of course, but it pulls you out of the movie.So, terrible acting, which I blame the director for, improbable scenarios, inexplicable conclusions. But also great cinematography and a beautiful soundtrack by Miles Davis.",

The cinematography is pure film-noir; the camera angles suspenseful and strange, without being overly abstract.There are some interesting scenes with a younger couple, who also become embroiled in the plot. The motel where a murder takes place is well-filmed, for some reason some of the scenes reminded me of Hitchcock's \"Rear Window\".The streets of Paris at night, as Moreau is obsessing about her boyfriend are especially indelible.

As we approach the end, all the loose strands finally come together. And the premise then seems quite ingenious.But my goodness, what a circuitous route ... and then the film just stops, rather suddenly. The plot requires improbable coincidences and unlikely occurrences. Too many characters and too much talk detract from any intended suspense. And in a city the size of Paris, how is it that most of the main characters all seem to know each other?The B&W cinematography provides the main reason to watch. Natural lighting adds texture and mystery. Outdoor scenes at night are very high contrast. Which gives the film a noir look and feel. A slow, jazzy score with Miles Davis on trumpet conveys a mournful, sad tone, which blends nicely with the atmospheric lighting.Casting is okay. But acting seems indifferent and aloof. Jeanne Moreau is a wonderful actress. But her character, Florence, is so emotionless. Nor does Maurice Ronet, who plays Florence's partner in crime, convey much emotion, given his predicament. Maybe the Director, Louis Malle, wanted impersonal characters. The only tension is provided by a sequence wherein we peer down a dark elevator shaft.\"Elevator To The Gallows\" could have been a really fine movie, with a better script and possibly a different director. Even so, that B&W lighting, particularly the night scenes, is marvelous, and together with the mournful score, does convey a wonderfully dark, moody film in some sequences.",

            "content": "(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon.)This was Louis Malle's first. Previously he had worked with Jacques Cousteau on \"The Silent World\" (interestingly enough) and now tried his hand at film noir. Several things fell into place to make this debut a memorable one.First, he was able to get Jeanne Moreau to play Florence Carala. She had previously been mostly a stage and B-movie player who was obviously very talented, but as Malle put it, not considered really photogenic. What she becomes after her performance here is a premier star of the French cinema partially because of the way she is photographed, and partly because she was so perfectly suited to the character, which I suspect she helped to create. She does a lot silently or with just a few words in the scenes where she walks the streets of Paris, frantic because her lover and fellow murder conspirator, Julien Tavernier (Maurice Ronet) has stood her up and she cannot understand what has happened.Second, Malle's collaboration with screenwriter and novelist Roger Nimier adapting a roman thriller by Noel Calef to the screen turned out to be exactly right for the material, especially because they used mostly just the plot of the novel and expanded Moreau's role.The third factor was the fortuitous jazz score by Miles Davis. Davis happened to be in Paris as the movie was being edited and Malle was able to talk him into doing a trumpet-centered original score, said to have been composed on the fly late one night and early the next morning as Moreau drank champagne and listened.\"Ascenseur pour l'echafaud,\" like so many American film noirs that it frankly resembles, is a murder done for love and money gone wrong. It is both a mistake by the murderer and fate itself that traps Julien Tavernier. But there is an intriguing complication in the person of young Louis (Georges Poujouly) who steals Julien's car and takes the flower girl (who admired the dashing Tavernier from afar) on an ill-fated joy ride. Unlike most of Malle's work to come, this is clearly a plot-driven, commercial flick (but oh, so exquisitely done!) without a hint of the usual autobiographical elements for which Malle is so well-known.The Criterion Collection two disc set features interviews with Moreau, Malle and others, and includes Malle's student film, \"Crazeologie,\" (after a Charlie Parker tune) a \"theater of the absurd\" little ditty about which I can only say I would never have guessed that Louis Malle was the auteur. \"Elevator to the Gallows\" itself is a beautifully restored high-definition black and white transfer with new and excellent subtitles. There is a booklet with an insightful review by Terrence Rafferty and part of a very interesting interview with Malle conducted by Philip French.By the way, Malle was 24-years-old when he made this film and commented that he was very worried about his ability to work with actors since he had \"spent four years\" previously \"filming fish\"! (quoting from the Philip French interview). He gives Jeanne Moreau credit for being \"incredibly helpful\" until he lost his fear of actors.So, see this for Jeanne Moreau, one of the legends of the French cinema, who displays here a kind of magnetic sexuality that had me thoroughly intrigued.",

            "content": "\"Ascenseur Pour L'Echafaud\" (aka \"Elevator To The Gallows\" & \"Lift To The Scaffold\") is an excellent story of betrayal and murder which develops through a variety of mistakes, misunderstandings and coincidences to produce an absorbing thriller which is full of twists and suspense.Florence Carala (Jeanne Moreau) and Julien Tavernier (Maurice Ronet) are secretly having an affair and devise a plan to murder Florence's husband Simon (Jean Wall). Simon is an arms dealer and Julien is one of his employees. Julien, an ex-paratrooper who served his country in the wars in Algeria and Indo-China, regards arms dealing as despicable and considers Simon to be contemptible for the means by which he has achieved his wealth. Simon works on the floor above Julien and on a Saturday, shortly before the weekend shut-down, Julien uses a rope to clamber up from the balcony outside his office to gain access to the area where Simon is working. Julien carries out the murder in a very calm and composed manner and arranges the scene to make it appear that his employer has, in fact, committed suicide. On returning to the balcony outside his own office, the telephone rings and he rushes to answer it to avoid any impression being given that he had been absent from his desk at the time of the murder. From that point on, he proceeds as planned and leaves the building with his colleagues at closing time. A problem arises, however, when he reaches the street, looks back up at the building and notices that he has left the rope dangling on the balcony rail. In order to put matters right he re-enters the building but gets trapped in the elevator when the power is cut off. Florence, who is waiting for him to pick her up at a nearby caf\u00e9 has no way of knowing what has happened and becomes increasingly concerned when she sees Julien's car drive past with a woman she recognises in the front passenger seat.Unknown to Florence, Julien's car has been stolen and the thief goes on to commit murder. The police suspect Julien of the thief's crime and Julien is then reluctant to use his genuine alibi because that could implicate him in Simon Carala's death.\"Ascenseur Pour L'Echafaud\" is notable for marking the directorial debut of Louis Malle and also for providing Jeanne Moreau with her first major success on screen. The cinematography by Henri Decae contains all the hallmarks of the nouvelle vague style especially during the night-time street sequences and Miles Davis' improvised score greatly enhances the mood and the intensity of the action. All the events depicted in this movie unfold in a very short time frame and the tension increases as the couple's plans gradually fall apart.",

The climb up and down is suspenseful, the killing is tense, and the tone changes to somewhat comical, successfully. Julien realises he's left the rope, so he returns for it, and becomes stuck in the lift by a power outage. Carala is waiting for him at a nearby restaurant. His car's engine is running, and in fact, his car is being stolen. Car thieves happen to drive right in front of the girlfriend, who is unaware he is stuck in the lift, and thinks he's out with another girl- while he is, in fact, trying to break out of the lift he is still stuck in. The car thieves then become film's focus, as we follow them to an odd encounter, subsequent dinner, double murder - and their attempt at suicide. Julien manages to get out of the lift and away from the scene of the crime he committed - only to find himself the prime suspect in the murder committed by the two lovers who stole his car, and assumed his identity, the night before! A wonderfully jazzy, suspense/ comedy of errors set in 1950s Paris, filled with dark, yet crystal clear, photography during one a rainy night, a great jazz score, and more plot twists than one can count, without being overly contrived and convoluted, and sporting a wonderfully ironic twist ending. The film has a sense of humour, but the dialogue is handled mostly straight, it is some of the situations the characters find themselves in, which is meant to be funny. I'm not a big car nut either, but the Mercedes-Benz 300SL looks incredible, also. I had the pleasure of seeing this one in a cinema (along with Odds Against Tomorrow, Elevator To The Gallows, Sweet Smell Of Success, and Anatomy Of A Murder) as part of a mini film festival they called Jazz Scores Of Film Noir; this, and Experiment In Terror, were my favourites of the lot.",

            "content": "Full of intention as only a first film can be, Louis Malle's debut crime drama is about two couples. But it is also about French society as a whole and where France was, historically, at the time. The original novel lacked the context and commentary of the film, and it would have made a fine suspense drama in the right hands, but Malle made his film much more complex.The story begins as one of those perfect-crime cop procedurals Can the intelligent protagonist get away with murder? Maurice Ronet plays Julien Tavernier, the man who hopes to gain possession of another man's wife via the crime. Jeanne Moreau, in a breakthrough role, plays the part of the illicit lover, Florence, who waits for Julien to do the deed. But things go awry as they inevitably must in a perfect crime story.Two younger lovers occupy the rest of the narrative. They steal a car on a lark and aimlessly fall into a misadventure that is ruinous.The two stories occur simultaneously. Although the story of the illicit lovers has elements that comment on French society, the second story is rife with observations about French involvement in global conflicts, disillusionment with the French government, and what Malle calls the \"consumer generation.\"This is a low budget film, but it makes the most of its resources. In fact, Moreau was drawn to the project because it lacked layers of personnel, conventional uses of makeup and lighting, boring down time between shots, and the expectations of a major cinema production.The scenes where Florence walks the streets of the city at night are iconic. Using mostly ambient light and eschewing heavy makeup, Malle creates an atmosphere that is notable for its naturalism. The true beauty of Moreau is a revelation. Of course the score of Miles Davis is also significant.Used sparingly throughout the film, the score by Davis---which was a milestone (pardon the pun) in cinema and jazz---is another reason why Malle's style-over-substance approach is so successful in the film. Davis improvised the experimental score so effectively it affected the rest of his career. For jazz lovers, I compare its improvisation to Stan Getz's album \"Focus\".I prefer not to dwell on the few plot holes in the film. In the end, it never creates a high level of suspense, nor does it try to. It has something to say about the role chance plays in our lives. And Malle foreshadowed some generational trends in French society. But its greatest success is its evocation of ambience through choices in style and design. Malle admitted that he \"cheated\" a little, by placing the story in a Paris that did not actually exist at the time, architecturally, (but soon would); it is just one of the artistic choices he made that helped create an interesting work of art.",

            "content": "This overrated love triangle-murder film is nevertheless notable for several reasons. Of historical interest, the film stands at the cusp between the noir period that ended in the late 50s and the beginnings of the French New Wave. Shot in black & white, the love/murder thriller motif is clearly in the noir tradition, like \"Double Indemnity.\" And yet, the two kids (Louis and Veronique) that foil the murder plan prefigure young adults on sprees in Godard's \"Breathless\" (1960) and \"Band of Outsiders\" (1964). In this film a man in love with Jeanne Moreau's character murders her husband at her insistence. \"Gallows\" and Malle's \"The Lovers,\" released the same year and also starring Moreau, are often credited as the films that made her career (though in fact she had achieved earlier stage success in the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise and had performed in 20 films before \"Gallows\").This film also marked Malle's directorial debut, and it features breathtakingly vivid photography and a sensational jazz score by Miles Davis. The elevator sequence recalls Hitchcock's best stuff. With so many pluses, it is obvious why the film continues to enjoy strong support: a high quality print is in current U.S. distribution (a copy of which I just saw on the big screen).So why do I say \"Gallows\" is overrated? For one thing, the plot is not believable. Without giving details away, it is simply not credible that so many adverse coincidences could befall so many people. Secondly, too many of the characters are clich\u00e9d, e.g., the broken nosed detective, the too-busy businessman spouse, the ever faithful secretary who toils away on her Saturday afternoon off, the thrill seeking young couple, the taciturn lover-murderer. It's almost camp and laughable as such.Besides Moreau, the only intriguing character in the film is the not-quite-savvy-enough older German man (played by the veteran actor Iv\u00e1n Petrovich), whose motel encounter with Louis and Veronique proves very costly indeed.(In French).

Still, it's certainly a very watchable movie, although possibly somewhat inferior to its cult status.

I loved the opening scene, and I was so intensely focused on it that I caught the mistake that leads to all the subsequent drama. I was truly fascinated to see the way that things kept spiraling further and further out of control as the film went on, and all because of that one minor misstep. The initial plan was so straightforward that I had to commend the main character on his idea. It's just a shame that he failed to think on his toes when one thing went wrong. I think there are a few elements of the film that are a little outdated which took me a minute to understand, particularly with the technology. That being said, most of the movie worked as a thriller and kept me fully engaged because I was desperate to know what would happen and if the protagonist would get away with his crime.One of the biggest struggles I had with Elevator to the Gallows was the fact that almost every character we follow is a bad person. Even those who we never see committing a crime are at least complicit in the criminal activities. Not only that, but most of the characters make some stupid decisions. These are necessary things to keep the plot moving forward, but it bugs me when I see someone acting dumb for no good reason. Despite my struggle with the characters and their choices and motivations, the film as a whole still worked well for me. I liked how claustrophobic it felt for Maurice Ronet's character, but I'm also glad we did not have to spend the entire duration of the movie trapped with him. Overall, Elevator to the Gallows was a satisfying experience. While I might prefer movies with more likable characters, it still had an exciting plot that kept me interested the entire time.",

Several times I wanted to shout at one of the characters: \"Why are you doing that, you idiot?\" There were moments when I just had to laugh, one of them being when a character gets trapped inside an elevator, late on a Friday afternoon, no less, the one thing he didn't expect to happen, surely a classic case of being hoisted on one's petard. In fact, the first twenty minutes of the film are practically a comedy of errors. The plot is really a chain of events, swinging in an ever-widening arc, that invites questions regarding fate, chance and human will. Was it the phone ringing that triggered Julien's forgetfulness? Were the wayward series of events meant to arrive at a conclusion that was inevitable, anyway? What about the timing of Louis and Veronique's aimless spin on the highway that precipitates a \"chance\" string of events?None of the characters, particularly Florence (Jeanne Moreau), prone to arch romanticism, struck me as being very rational, and poor Lucien seems tossed about by the whims of chance like flotsam on the ocean. As Florence, wandering through the film like a ghost, Moreau assumes that smoldering detachment that made her vengeful angel in \"The Bride Wore Black\" so compelling. Miles Davis' score is quite sparse, as the film relies on silence and ambient sounds, particularly that unsettling thunder in the early stages of the rainstorm. \"Elevator to the Gallows\" is a feast of human foibles that lead only to rue and ruin.",

It's well directed, with lots of interesting plot twists (indeed, too many. I don't think the French were in the habit of arresting rich Parisians who were walking at five a.m. without ID, just so Moreau and the police inspector who eventually busts her will be able to meet) Some of the scenes, like the police interrogation, complete with black background and Miles Davis' nervous, discordant trumpet on the sound track, punctuating the cops' questions, are amazingly good. Sure coulda done with less of Jeanne Moreau wandering around Paris and whining about how much she loves her boyfriend/killer, though. I know I'm supposed to be blown away by this actress, and I have liked her in other films, like \"Diary Of A Chambermaid\" and \"La Notte,\", but here she's just your average criminal adulteress. Kind of a Bette Davis wannabe. Let's give it a B. (To get an A it would have had to have given us one person about whom we gave a damn, like the best Hitchcock films do.)",

The DVD quotes Halliwell's guide to the film as \"Cold, Clever and rather Elegant:\" I agree! The music score by Miles Davis undertones a brood of menace, and seems to follow you everywhere without escape -ubiquitously!The film and the music appear to be inseparable -and this is how the music affects me: \"Night time, night train - black and sinister - the train approaching, it has a blue light of menace, lingering and watching, like a mechanical, revolving eye of evil -but too late: the blue eye has spotted me from afar, and I await -frozen in thoughts of dreams, in black terror and shadows, as I walk across yards of railway lines, in criminal and devious mind, to escape the black train....\"Of course, there is no train in this film, but when I hear Miles Davis pumping out prolonged sounds from his trumpet, and then the music stops -and in silence - my mind goes into a guilty state of panic as though I have been caught; but strangely with the music playing, I get some solace that I am still fearfully running away from the crime....my idea comes from the main and throbbing theme ( 'Nuit Sur Les Champs-Elysees' ) while Jeanne Moreau is parading down the avenue in despair: (....there is a clap of thunder in the sky, and rain is near: ) The music certainly enhances the quality of the film!The film takes you on a journey of dread: dark humour, hate, and murder - and it all starts with a premeditated murder, and then a spontaneous one....the unfortunate turn of fate begins when the elevator ( lift ) in the office -shuts down along with the electrical current at close of office time -with the murderer inside the lift, who is keen to flee the scene with a remarkable alibi in hand.The journey will also involve a couple of tear-away lovers who steal the murderer's car outside the office - and so we have the beginnings of two dramas -interlinked, and with a casual and indiscreet police department involved here and there; it is like a double-pieced jigsaw puzzle that fits either way, but with different pictures and patterns? The film seems to reflect a tough period in France that had been influenced in an undertone of past occupation following their involvement with Algeria:That is a rough sketch of the plot, except that the story and film is attractive to a remarkable and exquisite feeling of being there in the film, and in the present - and draws the viewer closely into the tension of drama.I just love how the film unfolds with remarkable cinematography in black and white, mesmerizing and sensational, as though the photography is in a singular formation of imaginary: Sensational!It is wonderful to have a DVD copy of the film, ( and the CD music as well. ) Louis Malle, the film director had a thought of genius to ask Miles Davis to write and play the music score while Miles was in Paris: The result is astonishing!The film is angry, arrogant: dry, and has a fresh feeling to French New Wave cinema: film buffs will love this film in awe of classic French cinema and photography, and I would highly recommend. Timeless, never dated I say!I dedicate my review to Lynn in Cirencester ( on behalf of Oxam ) of whom, on heartfelt zeal - she kindly provided me with a copy of the DVD, and upon speaking to the lady herself, she assured me of its postal delivery: I thank her!NB. I do acknowledge that the movie comes under 'French film noir' -or 'French New Wave' - but I have just gained a very much needed sense of humour and lightness with regard to the compulsory, but casual need of French I/D cards and to the theatrical police procedures during a prevalent time of history in France: ( remembering that France is a Republic! )",

I just saw it in a fresh theater print and loved it for all the reasons covered by the previous respondents. It holds up tremendously well for a fifties flick I think because the director, being new to the game, was concentrating on telling the story and avoided any self-conscious stylization. Style is there of course and I detected minor references to one or two American \"noirs\". The cutting between Florence and Julien seen through the metal gates of the office entrance and the elevator reminded me of Mary Astor's last shot in \"The Maltese Falcon\", hinting of jail-time to come. No explanation was given for the sudden appearance of the grappling hooks and rope which are seen at Florence's feet as she tries to find Julien at the office. The small girl she talks to then makes off with them. Julien at that point had not escaped from the elevator, so how did they fall to the street? Is there a scene missing here? I also thought it very unlikely that Julien, who was obviously very experienced in climbing with these hooks, would neglect to automatically take them with him after the murder. Also it seemed out of character for a well-trained paratrooper like him to actually leave his car on the street with the motor running when he had to return for the hooks. The later incident with the kids and German tourists relied on accepting that the tourists were remarkably good-humored with the kids who followed them to the motel. After a highway chicken-race and having the back of my Mercedes gull-wing roadster rear-ended at the motel I would have called the cops right away. When Julien was being questioned by the police he could have proved he was stuck in the elevator all night by describing how he dropped the flaming Gauloise pack down the shaft (its remains still had to be there) and take his chances that the cops would still accept that his victim had actually committed suicide and his night in the elevator was just an unfortunate coincidence. Small gripes, but they really did not spoil the movie for me. I thought the \"denouement\" was very inventive and satisfying. Worth another look.",

            "content": "ELEVATOR TO THE GALLOWS is a crime drama, which is a sort of collision between the American film noir and the French New Wave. The film was based on a novel of the same name by No\u00ebl Calef. The main protagonist is a former paratrooper and veteran of war. He decides to kill the husband of his mistress, who is a rich industrialist and his boss. He has planned the perfect murder, while his crime has to look like a suicide. However, he remains stuck in an elevator after the murder, which initiates a series of unplanned events...Mr. Malle has brought protagonists in a very interesting position. The murderer was captured after his own mistakes. Two young delinquents have engaged in a very dangerous adventure. Woman in love has aimlessly wandered on the bleak streets. The three human stories that are associated with love and crime.The perfect crime has lost its purpose in a series of random events. Each of these events was accompanied by a large dose of irony. The story has certain drawbacks. Every crime was made for love. Plots, which are based on the murder and theft were quite tense.Each of the protagonist has faced with a life struggle. The gloomy and depressing atmosphere has fully corresponded to such relationships. The acting is pretty good, but there is a lack of emotion. Characterization is solid, but almost all the characters have remained incomplete at the end of the film.Jeanne Moreau as Florence Carala is a major figure in this film. She is a woman who has fought for her love to the end. This is a realistic view on a woman in love, while her love and happiness running away from her. Her face is the scene of clashes between the drama, love, desire, courage and disappointment. Maurice Ronet as Julien Tavernier is very interesting at the beginning of the film. However, his character becomes monotonous in the second part of the film. Georges Poujouly (Louis) and Yori Bertin (V\u00e9ronique) are a young couple of delinquents, which are lost in their own struggle between existence and immaturity.This movie is a somewhat successful experiment. There are certain segments of the ambiguities in the story, but plots are quite interesting. Maybe a little slow for the crime genre.",

The murderer (MAURICE RONET) gets stranded in an elevator when he goes back into the office building to retrieve a rope he used for climbing into an executive's window. The plot takes a double spin when a young couple take his car for a joy ride while he's trapped in the elevator. They get involved with another couple on the road, and the young man ends up killing the other driver and his wife after trying to steal their car. He's been using Ronet's identity which makes the police draw the wrong conclusion.JEANNE MOREAU is the young woman waiting in vain for her lover to return, not knowing that he's been trapped after committing what they hoped would be the perfect murder. The rest of the plot gets tangled up in mixed identities so I won't give any more of it away, but the ending is wrapped up neatly by a plot device that reveals to the police just who murdered whom.Well worth watching--an enjoyable film directed by Louis Malle in film noir style with a jazz soundtrack that gives it a still modern look.The plot has the film noir elements found in many crime melodramas written by American writer James M. Cain (\"The Postman Always Rings Twice,\" \"Mildred Pierce,\" etc.) and the crisp B&W photography of Paris in the dark adds to the atmospheric mood of the city, as does the jazz score by Miles Davis.",

Framed by the terrific Jazz score by Miles Davis, this is the story of two lovers, played by Jeanne Moreau and Maurice Ronet, who construct what should come off as the perfect crime- the murder of her arms sales dealer-husband. In what could later be termed 'a colossal failure of technology', the flawless execution of the crime quite literally suffers a power failure, putting unforeseen events into action.At every turn the characters get tripped up not by the authorities, but by their own hubris, or just plain stupidity. An often-used element of good Noir is the concept of a character escaping blame for a crime they are guilty of, only to finding themselves trapped by charges of another crime they are innocent of. What makes this film a stand-out is the manner in which the most inane objects are used to weave an intricate twisting plot, yet not so much that it becomes convoluted. Yes there are some plot holes and glaring implausibilities. But it's all worth it by the final scene, when the unfaithful Moreau- in an attempt to exonerate her lover- discovers that the camera indeed never lies.",

Meanwhile his girlfriend walks the Parisian city streets looking all beautiful and sad and depressed, not doing any of the logical things you'd expect for someone in her situation. Melville could get away with these kind of fast-and-loose games with the plot, because his was essentially an alternate universe. (I should say that Melville's movies make more sense than this, too.)

            "content": "It's almost always a good sign when a movie begins to impress in one or multiple ways from the very beginning. For the second and surely not the last time in watching the works of Louis Malle I can only ask how one watches this and doesn't immediately fall in love? What here isn't exquisite? Malle's direction, even in only his first full-length feature, is fabulously smart, as is the splendidly keen, vivid cinematography of Henri Deca\u00eb. What can one say of Miles Davis' original music except that it's an absolute joy, perfectly matching every scene to greet us no matter the flavors? The cast give strong performances of poise and nuance, all making their mark even in the first moments they appear on-screen - Jeanne Moreau, Maurice Ronet, Yori Bertin, Georges Poujouly, and the rest. Scarcely has 'Elevator to the gallows' begun and it's wonderfully, endlessly pleasing as a viewer.Some shots, sequences, or bits of dialogue carry slight airs of an art film in their arrangement, even as there's a definite story to be told. The narrative greets us right out of the gate with the dark tension of a crime thriller, followed in short order by the offbeat thrills of crime and tension gone wrong. At first it seems so simple, yet the tale quickly spirals out in splendidly varied, original directions, and all the while the adapted screenplay of Malle and co-writer Roger Nimier boasts superb intelligence in its scene writing as the plot takes shuffling steps both sideways and forwards. No matter where the picture ultimately takes us, the journey is captivating in unexpected ways, and every component part helps to build that rapturous enchantment, even underappreciated facets like lighting and shot composition. It bears repeating that Malle's direction is impeccable, whether in orchestrating shots and scenes or guiding his cast, and that cast delivers quietly vibrant acting that in and of itself is rich and enticing.Factor in the terrific, fetching filming locations, and excellent production design, art direction, and hair and makeup work; factor in the noir-esque notions of shady figures losing control of a downward spiral. And once more I ask: what here is not to love? How is this not more well known? It has all the characteristics of Hollywood thrillers of the 40s or 50s, yet with enduring little flames of brilliance in this or that aspect that together help the movie to feel fresh, new, and a creation all its own. I don't know that I can even rightly say there are any flaws here, save perhaps for the very specific writing of a few moments. In one instance a scene plays out with a lack of definition that means context is lost for non-French or even perhaps non-contemporary viewers; in another - I dare say, the ending - the incongruity of what the dialogue portends altogether makes no sense that I can discern. There must be something I'm missing, even if it's just necessary particular knowledge of France in the 1950s, which is itself perhaps a small mark against the feature insofar as it can't be readily, equally enjoyed by one and all across all time and space.Any such possible critiques are ultimately minor, however, and do not significantly detract from the viewing experience. By and large 'Elevator to the gallows' is an outstanding, absorbing film that deserves far more recognition: smart, well made, and detailed in every way. It's without question a tremendous credit to Malle that his first solo venture as a director was such a resounding success; far be it from me to gloss over Davis' exemplary contribution, but how can one really describe music? There is so much to earnestly appreciate in every last regard, and at length I can only offer my very high and hearty recommendation to all. Whatever your impetus for watching, whatever facet you may enjoy most, this is a great, compelling movie, and well worth checking out.",

Here's a French example, Malle's first, released in that same great year as Vertigo and Touch of Evil, certainly owing a debt to Hitchock particularly in the opening sequences, though not for my money quite on a par with either of the American masterpieces. Julien Tavernier plots to kill the wealthy husband of his mistress, Florence Carala (Jeanne Moreau) but leaves one crucial tool in the accomplishment of his plot behind; upon going to retrieve it he becomes stuck in the elevator as the electricity for the building is turned off for the weekend. He races desperately to escape, as his girlfriend becomes desperate with jealousy and paranoia when he doesn't meet her at the appointed hour, and a younger couple becomes embroiled in their own equally violent plot that all stems from their theft of his car.Meanwhile, the music of Miles Davis plays coolly throughout, and we get an early look at Parisian suburbs and a 50s motel, with endless stretches of open road....this is an international Paris, with an innocent German couple eventually and fatally caught up in the mess, and many evocations of American genre films alongside the great music. If the film ultimately is more an exercise in style than anything else, it's a powerfully successful one and it manages to do as much in spinning its spidery webs of crime in an hour and a half as any American B-noir of the period. The performances are generally good, though they don't necessarily resonate -- there's little in the way of showboating here, the players are as cool as the music -- and the Criterion DVD I rented is top-notch",

            "content": "Frankly, I first saw this film at a classic film show in South Africa in the early 1980s, and all I remembered was Ronet caught in a lift while Moreau searched for him all over Paris.At the time, I thought the movie was far too much ado about very little. I did not remember any of the twists of fate that intervene and ultimately render this such an ironical tale of love, in which Romeo and Juliet are killers who fail in their suicide attempt, and Ronet and Moreau are deeply in love but never once appear on the screen together (apart from appearing on photos at the end).Acting is absolutely top drawer from all. I liked in particular Ventura as the dogged police detective and Ivan Petrovich as the expansive, wealthy, cunning, and yet deceived German Horst Bencker. Poujouly is quite scary as an innocent-looking youth who has no qualms, or remorse, about stealing and killing.Moreau is the femme fatale for masterminding her hubby's murder, and yet one views her sympathetically because she is so in love with handsome Ronet.\nThe ill-starred V\u00e9ronique (played by Bertin) is no femme fatale, except in the sense that she is a willing partner in all the misdeeds committed by Poujuly.The script is full of ironical twists which curiously reflect the random nature of life, and keep you riveted.Photography is outstanding, proper noir expressionism in chiaroscuro, even if the scenes in the elevator are rather annoyingly hazy, tough to decipher what they show... but that only heightens the viewer's tension and eagerness to find out what happens next.Finally, Malle. Superb direction. Of course one can find uneven bits in the narrative, but it is stylish, never predictable and gripping. ASCENSEUR POUR L'ECHAFFAUD est un chef d'oeuvre, le ma\u00eetre!",

            "content": "Elevator to the Gallows, directed by Louis Malle, came out in France in 1958, the same year as Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo- and they bear noticeable similarities. Indeed, the Criterion Collection's booklet on Elevator cites Hitchcock as an influence on Malle. Both films are about attempts to carry out the perfect murder, with classic motives. Both are atmospheric and rich. Elevator to the Gallows may not be as famous, and I think it's somewhat underrated- Leonard Maltin gave it a lukewarm rating and claimed it \"doesn't hold up,\" but failed to explain how and by what standards. He even got the name of the movie wrong, calling it by its bastardized title Frantic. I'd say Malle's film is one of the best I've seen from France and from the 1950s.In it, Julien Tavernier kills a man named Simon Carala because he's in love with Carala's wife Florence, played by the beautiful Jeanne Moreau. He tries to make it look like suicide, then forgets a key piece of evidence outside the scene of the crime. Going back to get it, he gets caught in the elevator, while his car is stolen by a young couple. The young man impersonates Tavernier, and then commits a murder of his own, for which the real Tavernier is blamed by the French press (which evidently doesn't have to obey libel laws).Elevator is a very good yarn, as two separate murders happen to be thrown together as a wicked twist of fate, with guns fired not by their owners. Some reviewers have questioned how Tavernier could have forgotten such an important piece of evidence, but come on- he had committed a crime, and probably wanted to be done with it as quickly as possible; forgetting things is understandable under the stressful circumstances. Like Orson Welles with Citizen Kane, Malle made a real cinematic achievement at a young age, and more people should see this movie.",

            "content": "\"Ascenseur pour l'Echafaud\" (1957, and it is also known as \"Elevator to the Gallows\", \"Frantic\" and \"Lift to the Scaffold\"), was Louis Malle's first motion picture, so it can be regarded as one of the earliest Nouvelle Vague movies, although it lacks the iconoclastic, free-wheeling nature of the films from Jean-Luc Godard or the cool, ice cold criticism of bourgeoisie values that mark Claude Chabrol's masterly thrillers. However, the assured direction of actors and scenes make this not only interesting for historical reasons, but a really fine, charismatic crime picture.In synopsis, at least, it just sounds like another well worn twist on the \"Double Indemnity\" story: Florence Carala (Jeanne Moreau) and Julien Tavernier (Maurice Ronet) are lovers, but Florence is married to the boorish Simon Carala (Jean Wall), a wealthy arms industrialist who is also Julien's boss. Julien commits the apparently perfect murder and makes Simon Carala's death look like suicide: but when he tries to get rid of a clue that make his boss's death look suspicious, he gets trapped in a lift\u0085 However, after this, Malle, like that other supreme puppet \u2013master, Alfred Hitchcock, makes sure fate intervenes at every stage, dooming the couple from the beginning. Cutting between three separate plot strands and effortlessly maintaining coherence, both he and Editor L\u00e9onide Azar deserve garlands. The cast too, are fully up to the tasks set before them, with Moreau, Ronet and Georges Poujouly (who plays a disaffected youth straight out of Godard) taking the top honours. The cinematography as well, by Henri Deca\u00eb (who shot films by Jean-Pierre Melville and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut), all glistening surfaces, is a marvel. Of course, I am ignoring the elephant in the room: Miles Davis, the greatest Jazzman ever to have lived, provides the score and lifts the movie into a higher plane. It is defiantly one film noir not to miss out.",

            "content": "An extreme close-up shot of Jeanne Moreau gives an intimacy to her expressions of passionate love. No make-up. She could be in the throes. But pan back and we see she is on the phone, encouraging her lover towards murder most foul. Then back again. We see her side-on in a public phone box. Her crime is suddenly set in the real world.Florence Carala (Moreau) is in the process of dumping her wealthy ageing husband for a newer model. This being a murder mystery, dumping will not involve drawn out court cases. Instead, handsome ex-paratrooper Julien Tavernier, who conveniently works on the floor below the soon-to-be-deceased, will expedite matters. Locking his own door so people outside provide alibis, he enters the boss's office by means of an outside rope. It would be a perfect murder except he forgets the rope - until getting into his car to meet Florence. We've received the obvious clue on a plate, but circumstances in the rest of the movie will conspire towards an altogether different solution. For much of this time, Julien is stuck in a lift as Florence walks the streets.In this very impressive debut from Louis Malle, the small budget proves no impediment to delivering a taut thriller. With lots of low-level lighting and focussing on the key characters, Malle builds a gripping film with a minimum of props, extras or expensive kit. Moody and atmospheric, the big additional component is Miles Davis' haunting soundtrack. If you're a fan, it's worth watching the film for this stunning improvisation alone. Davis nails the mood as Moreau wanders forlornly from bar to bar through rain-drenched streets. It sets a great noir tone and allows us to drink in the scenery without too much dialogue.Not that the dialogue is weak. Julien, in the phone conversation, says, \"If I couldn't hear your voice, I'd be lost in a land of silence.\" Which is exactly where he ends up a few hours later. Stuck in a lift. The theme of separation is echoed in a subplot involving two tearaways who 'borrow' his car. After their plans also go fatefully astray, they contemplate the loneliness of being in separate jails once caught.Sympathy for our femme fatale and bad guy is helped along by a bit of political agit-prop. \"How many billions did the Indochina War bring you?\" Julien asks, obliquely criticising French arms dealing. Florence is always 'respectable'. The police apologise most profusely after mistakenly arresting her on suspicion of being a prostitute. They are portrayed almost as a 'nobility' class of murderers. Not like the low-lifes that nick Julien's posh babe-wagon and then irresponsibly use the gun in his raincoat pocket.Lift to the Scaffold is a clever thriller made with back-to-basics conditions. In that lies its appeal and the reason why it is sometimes heralded as a forerunner of the French 'New Wave'. It made Jeanne Moreau an international star. Seen some 50 years later it still has clout, although I was not fully convinced that a skilled operator like Julien would have been distracted into forgetting his rope . . .",

The background noise, the people rushing by, the general movement of traffic, all give the viewer a sense of being right there.This was the first film by Louis Malle. I was familiar with his other works like Atlantic City and My Dinner with Andre, from his later, American period, but had never seen or heard of this classy film. Therefore, it was a joy to discover this black-white European film-noir from the late 1950's.I was impressed with the on-screen personas of the leading actors, Jeanne Moreau and Maurice Ronet, not to mention the tense night-time atmosphere in Paris as the web of crime and deception engulfs the characters. The noir element is present with the planning and execution of a crime that becomes entangled in a set of miscalculations. The suspense, the darkness, the twists of fate, the trumpet music of Miles Davis all contribute to this wonderful movie. Recommend.",

That leads to me scanning through the criterion collection on Hulu and finding movies like Malle's Elevator to the Gallows (1958). Fans of Hitchcock on and movies like Diabolique (1955) will find a lot to enjoy with this one.Maurice Ronet plays Julien Tavernier a retired military man who is in love with his bosses wife. The two of them come up with a fool proof plan to kill the boss and make it look like a suicide. On a Saturday near closing time, when the building is empty, Julien slips out his window uses a small grappling hook to climb up the side of the building and sneaks into his bosses office. Julien shoots his boss and then plants the gun in his hand. Then he escapes back down the rope and back into his own office. Confident he has pulled off the perfect crime, Julien follows his fellow employees out of the building ready to go spend the rest of the weekend with bosses wife (Jeanne Moreau). Right before he drives off, Julien looks up and notices that he has left the rope dangling from the side of the building. Cursing he foolishness, Julien re-enters the building to go and retrieve the rope. As he is riding the elevator back up, the porter turns off the power in the building and traps Julien in the elevator. What follows is a series of mistaken identities and bad decisions that will lead to dire consequences for everyone involved.To check out our full review head on over to 3guys1movie.com",

            "content": "The french writer Camus and his cohorts postulated a universe that was totally incomprehensible and unpredictable. The dramas some of them created came to be known as \"Theatre of the Absurd\". Some of this stuff was very good, if a little trying on the psyche of the viewer. Try \"No Exit\" for an example. Some writers produced \"Theatre of the Absurd\" without possibly meaning to, or realising the fact. I don't think Noel Calef, the author of the source novel, was one of these, though.It is difficult to discuss more than the mere beginning of this film without giving away info that some viewers would prefer to discover for themselves. If so, abandon me after the first few sentences, but let's give it a start. A man plots to murder his boss, because he is in love with the wife of the boss. He has an elaborate, fool-proof plan, involving climbing up a rope one floor to avoid being seen to use the elevator. So far, so good. Or bad, depending on the point of view. Up on the boss's floor, the murder is carried out and made to look like suicide. Our man climbs down the rope and takes the elevator to the street, only then remembering that he has left the rope dangling. Well, back up in the elevator, and here's where things start to go monumentally wrong. The building custodian shuts off the main power, immobilising the elevator between floors, and stranding our \"hero\". If you think this is all that can go wrong, you don't know \"theatre of the absurd\".Better leave me now, but if you don't mind a bit more info, here it is. At street level, a teenage couple who know our man, whose name is Tavernia, steal his car and his identity to some extent. The crimes they commit in his name make his original crime look like a peccadillo. I'm going to leave you now, but I hope you will go on to the bitter end of this excellent film noir.",

Now I understand that he was just one of those overblown New Wave 'auteurs': praised because they were young and taking a couple of risks to show off how they were different from the old men, but achieving very little actually apart from looking the part, the part of the successful upstart that doesn't get caught and ends up thinking he really set new rules for the next generation.",

It holds up tremendously well for a fifties flick I think\nbecause the director, being new to the game, was concentrating on\ntelling the story and avoided any self-conscious stylization. Style is\nthere of course and I detected minor references to one or two American\n\"noirs\". The cutting between Florence and Julien seen through the metal\ngates of the office entrance and the elevator reminded me of Mary\nAstor's last shot in \"The Maltese Falcon\", hinting of jail-time to\ncome. No explanation was given for the sudden appearance of the\ngrappling hooks and rope which are seen at Florence's feet as she tries\nto find Julien at the office.

Louis Malle is one of those directors who is truly a master of his craft, a director who you have complete faith in, knowing that he is in complete control of the camera at all times. The cinematography is beautiful, and if you have a photographer's eye you are sure to be pleased. The story isn't bad either. It begins with a wife's lover, killing her husband, so the lovers can run off together. But its not that simple, things get a bit more complex from there. Miles Davis provides the smooth jazz soundtrack, which is just another great element to this film. Malle is someone I have personally become a fan of lately, and after seeing this, I am going to make a an effort to see his whole catalogue. This film is stylish and intelligent, but still has an underlying sense of humor, which gives it a lot of charm. Great stuff.",

            "content": "Camera-work, lighting...great noir efx. The teen characters, though, were ridiculously shallow and nonsensical. The scene of Tranvier trying to have some coffee while being outed as the headlining criminal is priceless and hilarious. Bothersome plot anomalies: How does the hook end up on the ground by the entrance to the building? This is the whole reason that Tranvier goes back in and gets stuck in the lift. But when Madame Carala runs into the girl there, the hook and line are inexplicably laying on the step. The girl picks them up as a toy to run off with. How did it get off of the railing from the upper floor??!!! It makes no sense, unless we saw a film that had been cut (we saw it at a movie house). There was a little rainstorm, but it didn't seem explained in those terms. Seems they should have shown it blowing about and coming loose if that was the case. Also, how is it that this mercenary type guy can't seem to get himself out of an elevator shaft? What kind of lame-o is he anyways? Certainly not the secret agent type that you see in Patrick McGoohan's Danger Man/Secret Agent or the more cartoonish Bond. He didn't even try to squeeze through the gap between the floor and the door. And he just seemed to give up too easily. These two things ruined the logic of the movie for me. I also love how the police are immediately able to connect Tranvier in the elevator to the murder and how Mdme. Carala immediately admits to her complicity in the murder of her spouse. Yes, he was there and perhaps they could show motive in their affair, but that hardly means an automatic conviction. Maybe in the pre-OJ era that was enough. The movie has a great feel overall, though, and leaves one wanting more. It gives a good sense of modernism mostly by not showing a bunch of typical landmarks. The highway scene at near dark is amazing. What a sad ending, though.",

            "content": "Spoiler Alert!Crime doesn't pay. Having watched this very unique and entertaining film, and not for the first time, I realize this important fact better than ever before.Another reviewer skeptically asks why Florence (Jeanne Moreau) expects everyone in Paris to know who her lover, Julien (Maurice Ronet), is, but I believe that her inquiries are targeted on folks who do know him, and Julien is a guy who sure gets around. He is so suave and sure of himself that he is destined to mess up the perfect crime. It's almost as if he wants to get caught or needs an excuse to return to the scene of the crime and to get stuck in an elevator when the custodian, believing that all of the employees had left for the day, shuts down the building's power.Jeanne Moreau has a very interesting face, but she wanders the streets of Paris for far too long for one 90 minute movie. With her looks, her money and her obvious prestige, she could gain the companionship of any number of guys in Paris. What is so special about this guy, who, having committed a very serious crime, is careless enough to leave a rope dangling from the front of a very visible office building. In fact, when a car below directly approaches beneath him and in direct sight of him as he scales the side of the building by rope, I had to wonder why the occupants wouldn't report this oddity to the authorities as it was occurring. I guess that people in big cities tend to mind their own business, so I'll just have to accept that fact. Besides, as mom would say, if the cops appeared at the wrong time, it wouldn't make a movie.Aside from my knit picking, I enjoy watching this movie, ably cast and directed by Louis Malle (Atlantic City, Au Revior Les Enfants). At least in my mind, I can see Malle combing the streets of Paris until he stumbles upon this motel which must have been ultra-futuristic in 1958. I don't know of any motels in the US to this day that offer private, single car garages, just perfect for your Mercedes 300SL \"Gullwing\" or perhaps your very special 1952 Chevy Styleline convertible. Malle not only carefully picked his locations but his cars as well.Aside from the suspense, the film makes a very strong statement not only against the foreign wars in Algeria and Indochina where France had entangled itself at the time but against war itself. Although I am not a dedicated jazz fan, the score by Myles Davis enhances the prevailing, dark mood of the movie, which is mostly set in nocturnal Paris.Imagine being wanted all over Paris for a crime that you didn't commit, believing that no one suspects you of the one that you did commit. Yes, it vaguely hints of Frank Chambers' (John Garfield's) experience of being wrongly convicted for a crime that he did not commit and which was actually an accident while having believed that he would go free from the one that he did commit. As Mickey and Sylvia sang during the same era of the late 1950's as the making of this film, \"love is strange\", not only in movies but in reality as well.",

How could the police find Tavernier's trench coat and gun in his car in the motel, when the killer escaped with them in the Mercedes-Benz of the Germans and abandoned that car with those objects in Paris? It also seems illogical that there would be so many pictures of Tavernier and his lover in the film. Someone had to do those pictures as they both appear on them, but why take that risk if they wanted it to be secret?

And yeah, it's raining!Miles Davis' soundtrack is the reason I watched Lift to the Scaffold in the first place and I like it even more now that I've seen the film and how the music adds to the atmosphere of the film along with the beautiful, stylized photography. Apart from the scenes accompanied by music this is a very quiet film, dialog being quite minimalist and sound in general toned down. This adds to the tension of the slow paced, but never boring, scenes.Apart from being a beautiful film and an example of the noir style that I love, Lift to the Scaffold actually has a plot that is captivating, interesting and full of suspense.

            "content": "My first French noir. Louis Malle's classic Elevator to the Gallows depicts a chain of events beginning with the murder of our protagonist's boss. The opening murder sequences play like a cold open of a classic Bond film. It is calm, quiet, neat, and emotionless. And the murderer, Julien Tavernier (Maurice Ronet), has the same charm as James Bond.The motive is that Tavernier has an affair with the boss' wife Mrs. Carala (Jeanne Moreau with an excellent performance). Tavernier becomes stuck in an elevator (hence the title), and handles this occurrence in true bond fashion: Sit back, relax for a while, and make plans. Carala is searching for him, as she is seen walking in the rain with lights from the street shining on her face in an iconic shot. Another event would be a couple stealing Tavernier's car to worsen the situation.I expected a straight cat-and-mouse/run-for-your-life thriller, but instead got a crime story told with three intertwining parts. For sure, the parts tie together and wrap up brilliantly, in a way that only noirs do. I give it 10 stars for now; Subject to change after I see more of these.",

Another commentator mentioned the rope and hook on the ground by the front gate, how did it get there? Then there's the photos of Julien and Florence in the tray...were they in the German's camera? Was the German guy following the adulterous couple? Perhaps I missed a line of dialog where that's explained. Maybe the husband Carala hired him? And the homicide detective telling Florence that Julien would get 10 years (out in 5) and she'd get 20. Why is that, why does Julien get less? And how does the detective know that Carala's death isn't a suicide? So I'm giving it a big thumbs up, but maybe somebody can answer my questions.",

None of the characters that suffer in this film are innocent, but we still end up not only invested heavily in the outcome despite plenty of guilt to go around, but relating to each of them individually. This film is like watching people play badminton with a grenade, and while there is a bit of a morbid fascination with seeing how the unpredictable events of the film will help spell out the fates of our pseudo-protagonists, director Louis Malle really shines with his understanding and depiction of emotion as characters recognize that they are being tossed around by circumstances beyond (or often, ironically within) their control. There's great views of midcentury Paris, including a beautiful shot of Jeanne Moreau walking half-stunned through busy traffic, eyes looking off in the distance, lost in speculation and worry. Tying it all together is the soundtrack from Miles Davis, literally composed to match the film as he and his group were watching it, resulting in a free-form jazz musical accompaniment that emulates the organic meandering of the plot and continues to receive praise. Pretty much convinced that Robert Bresson took this narrative as heavy inspiration for his own similarly-structured 1983 film, L'Argent. \n\nJust a reminder that Louis Malle was heavily involved with Jacques Cousteau's landmark documentary The Silent World, Bresson's timeless thriller A Man Escaped, and Elevator to the Gallows (his first feature debut) all before the age of 26. That's why everyone else should just give up. (4/5)",

Props to him for keeping his cool. \n\nI love how beautifully Miles Davis' score compliments the movie. It sets a really cool and noir tone for the film. Real slick and sexy. The overall look of the film is very unique. There's a certain feeling of mysticism that Paris has at night in this movie that I haven't really seen portrayed in other movies. It's quite magical really. The lighting is used in very creative and fun ways. \n\nThose shots of Jeanne Moreau wandering around the streets at night looking for Julien while Miles Davis' score plays in the background was very sexy and mesmerizing to watch. It's so crazy how the photos in the camera held all the evidence needed in order to convict everyone rightfully. \n\nSoaked in atmosphere and coolness. This movies got plenty of style going for it. Really good storytelling, the way they pieced everything together and the way everything plays out. Unfortunately, I don't think I'd watch it again. I don't really love noir films.",

I loved the opening scene, and I was so intensely focused on it that I caught the mistake that leads to all the subsequent drama. I was truly fascinated to see the way that things kept spiraling further and further out of control as the film went on, and all because of that one minor misstep. The initial plan was so straightforward that I had to commend the main character on his idea. It\u2019s just a shame that he failed to think on his toes when one thing went wrong. I think there are a few elements of the film that are a little outdated which took me a minute to understand, particularly with the technology. That being said, most of the movie worked as a thriller and kept me fully engaged because I was desperate to know what would happen and if the protagonist would get away with his crime. One of the biggest struggles I had with Elevator to the Gallows was the fact that almost every character we follow is a bad person. Even those who we never see committing a crime are at least complicit in the criminal activities. Not only that, but most of the characters make some stupid decisions. These are necessary things to keep the plot moving forward, but it bugs me when I see someone acting dumb for no good reason. Despite my struggle with the characters and their choices and motivations, the film as a whole still worked well for me. I liked how claustrophobic it felt for Maurice Ronet\u2019s character, but I\u2019m also glad we did not have to spend the entire duration of the movie trapped with him. Overall, Elevator to the Gallows was a satisfying experience. While I might prefer movies with more likable characters, it still had an exciting plot that kept me interested the entire time.",

Florence (Moreau) and Julien (Ronet) are two lovers out of wedlock, the only barrier is Florence's senescent but wealthy husband Simon (Wall), for whom Julien works as a corporate clerk, they diligently hatch a plot to get rid of Simon and make the pretense as a suicide scene. The scheme is executed according to the schedule until a last-moment hiccup (Julien forgets the damn rope on the roof), a black cat is always ominous, just when he returns to the company building to fetch it, Julien is accidentally left alone in the elevator. Meanwhile, a pair of youngster Louis and V\u00e9ronique (Poujouly and Bertin) lift Julien's posh car for a wild ride, en route, a harebrained Louis shot a German couple in a motel using the identity of Julien. The same night, Florence is aimlessly roaming around the streets of Paris, looking for her absent lover! \n\nThings will get messier the next morning when Julien gets out of the elevator, he is wanted by the police and Florence starts to get a grip on the entire misidentified situation, after a concise confrontation with Louis and V\u00e9ronique, a few developed photographs reveal the real culprits of both homicides, the star-crossed lovers meet their comeuppance as well as the hotheaded Louis.\n\nLogically speaking, its 88 minutes running time seems a bit sketchy for clarifying the police's investigation procedure and there are a flew negligible plot holes dangling (e.g. how the rope without a trace appears at the entrance of the building is never explained), obviously they are not Malle's first choice. The picture is mostly preeminent for the bounteous close-ups to examine his then lover Moreau's emotive visage (under a plain make-up free naturalism) with her inner voice-over, equally impressively is the Black & White shots of the night view on the expressway and in the interrogation part under a pitch-black background, it is a conflation of Film-Noir with a budding La Nouvelle Vague. My personal recommendation is a heart-in-the-mouth set piece for the acrophobic when Julien tries to scale down from the elevator when it abruptly descends, Ronet is solely in his prime and later his mojo would be evoked unconditionally in Malle's THE FIRE WITHIN (1963, 9/10). Two thumbs up to Malle for his immense dexterity in such an incipient stage of his career.  \n\nOne can also find some scattered fun in the film, such as the chic vehicle or the gizmos of a spy camera or the telephone-cum-pencil-sharpener, certainly for me they are eye-openers. Let's not forget Miles Davis' saxophone-heavy score, downright impromptu, but tallies with the film impeccably!  \n\nA more on-topic note is the alert message \"never leave photos around\", if only everyone could have watched this film before we reached this epoch of selfie fever, the world would be a bit less tumultuous indeed.",

That leads to me scanning through the criterion collection on Hulu and finding movies like Malle's Elevator to the Gallows (1958). Fans of Hitchcock on and movies like Diabolique (1955) will find a lot to enjoy with this one.\n\nMaurice Ronet plays Julien Tavernier a retired military man who is in love with his bosses wife. The two of them come up with a fool proof plan to kill the boss and make it look like a suicide. On a Saturday near closing time, when the building is empty, Julien slips out his window uses a small grappling hook to climb up the side of the building and sneaks into his bosses office. Julien shoots his boss and then plants the gun in his hand. Then he escapes back down the rope and back into his own office. Confident he has pulled off the perfect crime, Julien follows his fellow employees out of the building ready to go spend the rest of the weekend with bosses wife (Jeanne Moreau). Right before he drives off, Julien looks up and notices that he has left the rope dangling from the side of the building. Cursing he foolishness, Julien re-enters the building to go and retrieve the rope. As he is riding the elevator back up, the porter turns off the power in the building and traps Julien in the elevator. What follows is a series of mistaken identities and bad decisions that will lead to dire consequences for everyone involved.\n\nTo check out our full review head on over to 3guys1movie.com",

While it was unique, following two criminal couples with baggage in France, it wasn't particularly good. For one everything felt to coincidental, everything happened at the wrong time, or right time depending on how you viewed the film. I was viewing it rooting against the protagonists. All four of them, I was cheering for the police. Therefore the ending actually did bring some joy to me. I doubt this is how Malle intended to deliver the film though. I also felt like the female performances were amateur. The men did alright, but the woman didn't seem convincing at all. I feel like my rating is a tad rough, but honestly I didn't catch the hype. I'm not saying it's overrated, just not of value to me. I will say though, some scenes looked gorgeous.",

The fatal lovers should have featured more substantially and motives should have been more prominent. The performances are good, but unspectacular, and are not helped by the plot that features quite a lot of holes. The Miles Davis score is brilliant and the camera work is expressive without being overbearing. This is a worthwhile film, just don't have too high expectations.",

With its soothing soundtrack performed by Louie Armstrong, and with its elegant cinematography made by Henri Deca\u00c3\u00ab, Elevator to the Gallows flows wonderfully as a very successful neo noir. It has a distressing claustrophobic feel given by the intertwining elevator scenes, where the leading man got trapped after he committed a murder. Moreover, there is a devilish femme fatale strolling around the beautiful nightly Paris looking for her lover, and two reckless youngsters, who unintentionally drag themselves into the whole intrigue. Although the theme is classic, it doesn't seem derivative and looks surprisingly fresh in the French surroundings.",

The cool protagonist and a seductive blonde as his partner, accompanied by a classy score, this is a film that epitomizes the French noir films of it's time. The one problem I had was when Louis cannot steal the German's Mercedes because the German hid something the first gear of the gearbox. After Louis kills him, he manages to drive away in the Mercedes without adjusting any gearbox or anything; it wasn't a huge deal but it was confusing. Although there is quite a break from convention, the ending does not manage to tie up all the loose ends in a completely logical and realistic manner. Malle does cover his tracks and there is not any inconsistency in the ending, however, it seemed a bit out of place with the rest of the film.",

As in any good noir, we're rooting for characters who are duplicitous murderers.  And we want them to get away with it.  I absolutely loved this film.

            "content": "The doomed lovers of 1958's \"Elevator to the Gallows\" do not find their erotic passion lost in a smoke of underlying deception.  Their erotic passion is cloaked in the love Walter Neff dreamed of: quivering, gauzy, potent.  But it's obstructed by the presence of an unwanted husband, a husband perhaps too sensitive, too vengeful, to simply divorce.  Murder, it seems, is the only way to live happily ever after, even if all roads end in a blazing afterlife.\n\tThe lovers are Julien (Maurice Ronet) and Florence (Jeanne Moreau), her husband powerful business magnate Simon Carala (Jean Well).  She married young, putting comfort ahead of adoration; Julien, incidentally, resides under her husband's employment.  They aren't planning to off the man for his money - they figure the publicity, the ruthlessness of her husband would be catastrophic in their relationship.  So they come up with a foolproof plan: while Florence waits around in a chic Parisian caf\u00e9, Julien, pretending to go back up to his office for a few after hour tasks, will instead climb up to Carala's work space, shoot him point blank, and stage it as if it were a suicide.\n\tIt is the perfect murder, and is, for the most part, carried out with finesse only paralleled by the most experienced of assassins.  After the deed is done and the suspicions of his coworkers go untouched, Julien treads back to his convertible as if nothing is off, cool as a cucumber.  But just as his foot steps on the gas, he notices that the grapple hook he used to climb into Carala's office remains.  Though it's bound to eventually fall and go unnoticed by investigators, Julien's paranoia manages to seep into his common sense - so he decides to barge back into the building at the last moment, figuring that taking a chance poses too many risks.  But as he takes the elevator back up to his office, the very worst possible scenario becomes a reality when the security guard shuts off the electricity and leaves our sympathetic killer trapped in the confines of the shaft.  \n\tFlorence waits for what feels like days, wandering around the city while hiding her internal despair, letting rain pour onto her poreless facsimile as she gives numb face to the empty chill of the night.  Did the lover she once trusted betray her?\n\t\"Elevator to the Gallows\", the directorial debut of Louis Malle, is a mood piece years ahead of its time, its Miles Davis scored, glacial black-and-white assimilating it into something nearly futuristic in its slippery minimalism.  It's film noir at its most downbeat, its most bewitching; the midnight streets of the city are seductively \"The Third Man\", and the murder is an act of love tattered by true affection rather than the artificial sort of \"Double Indemnity\".  \"Elevator to the Gallows\" is so elegantly dangerous because it's the kind of film where everything goes wrong; perfection is cheap.  It's the alarm of an unexpected deviation that beguiles.  \n\tThe central romance between Julien and Florence diffuses a sort of efficacy only found in the love stories of forgotten classics - their devotion to one another makes the stake riddled surroundings all the more agonizing because we want them to end up together.  Their crime is not a part of a double-cross or a scheme; it's an act of despondency fueled by desire.  The side-plot, which focuses on the attractive teenage couple (Georges Poujouly, Yori Bertin) that steals Julien's car, commits murder, attempts suicide, and gets him framed, is so gripping only because it so eccentrically reflects the plight of the main anti-heroes.  While the latter couple plans everything methodically yet doesn't get away with it, the former acts on haphazard instinct and glides by with ludicrous success.  It's an irony Malle sees through with an utmost tragic eye.\n\tBut \"Elevator to the Gallows\" is stylish, sophisticated entertainment meant to bridge the gap between thriller style and the heaviness of crime and its side effects.  In the end, our eyes are more pleased than our intellectual pangs (it's much more captivating to gaze upon Moreau's masterfully understated performance than consider the reality of it all), but \"Elevator to the Gallows\" is a noir less 1958 and more timeless - its efficiency has not aged.",
