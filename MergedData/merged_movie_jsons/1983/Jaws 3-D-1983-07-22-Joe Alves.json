            "content": "*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*Jaws invades an underwater park. The idea was great.  The problem is the special effects were terrible. I missed it when it came out in theaters so I never got to experience the 3-D phenomenon.  Maybe that would have made a difference but I doubt it.A giant shark attacking a Sea World like park was a great starting point. But it's hard to get scared of Jaws when he looks like the shark at Universal Studios.  I mean he was one plastic shark. I need to believe Jaws is a real shark inflicting terror.  This time, I didn't.  He was definitely a big toy floating in the water.  The climax scene was the worst of all.SPOILER ON ENDINGJaws goes headfirst through the window of the control room. In 3-D, this might have been cool.  In the tape I saw, it looked awful.\nAlthough the effects were rotten, I still find myself enjoying this flick. Face it, all the Jaws sequels have a very high bar set for them.  They are not going to even get close to the original \"Jaws\". For a B giant shark flick, it was pretty good.  Comparing it to \"Jaws\" is unfair but also unavoidable. Even though I know the effects were bad, I still liked it.  It was the best \"Jaws\" sequel.",

            "content": "Saw this one in all its 3D glory in the theater back in 1983, and it really scared the heck out of me. (I was ten) This film furthers the saga of the Brody family as sons Sean and Mike are now fully grown and moved away from Amity Island. Sean does something in Colorado if I recall, and Mike is (heh, heh, heh,) an underwater welder who just finished construction of an undersea kingdom at Sea World in Florida. Just when the park is about to have a grand opening, some uninvited guests show up. They being a 35-foot great white shark and her offspring. Needless to say, some people get eaten.This film was originally going to be made as spoof of the previous two films. I'm not sure if any type of a finished script to that effect exists, but it would be worth a look. Jaws 3D ends up being another serious monster movie with a disaster movie subplot. Not only does the shark eat a bunch of people, it also traps several others in the underwater part of the park. The race is on to save the people and kill the mother shark. Her baby dies midway through after it is captured and hastily put on display in the park. The conclusion is fairly exciting, and full of bloody carnage.The cast is one of the stronger points of the film. Dennis Quaid is the fearless Mike Brody. Bess Armstrong plays the park's head biologist and Quaid's love interest. (The real sparks were apparently flying between Quaid and Lea Thompson off camera, though!) Thompson plays a water skier at the park, and John Putch plays Sean Brody who falls for her. Simon MacCorkindale and P.H. Moriarity play a couple of Englishmen who show up and help battle the sharks. By far the best performance is turned in by Louis Gossett Jr., fresh off his Oscar for An Officer and a Gentleman. He plays the owner/manager/president (I'm really not sure which) of the park. He has a terrific moment as he addresses the park guests in the underwater tunnels over the p.a. system. He turns on the fake executive public relations charm and asks them all to calmly exit the park just as the giant shark is bearing down on them.The individuals who play Dan and Liz left a lot to be desired. Since no other film credits are listed for them, one would have to conclude that they actually worked at Sea World and were given these roles since this is what they do on a daily basis. Maybe they still work there. Anyone know? The sharks look pretty good in most of the scenes. Except at the very end when the shark is lodged into the control room and its tail is sticking out. That looked incredibly fake. In addition, sharks must always stay moving in the water or they'll die. They can't just lay low in huge underwater structures waiting to pounce on their victims. They usually strike from directly underneath their victims in most attack scenarios. The big shark in this film also has the ability to growl and roar, but not as loudly as the one in part IV! The 3D effect looked very good in the theater, but films like this lose quite a bit of their luster on the TV screen. You're only left with a bunch of gag shots that were supposed to scare viewers in the theater, but now look ludicrous and forced.This film made some pretty decent $ in its theatrical run, and is still shown regularly on television. If nothing else is on, and you find yourself in front of a TV for an extended period, give this film a try. But be forewarned: Part IV is perhaps the worst film ever made. Don't waste your time on that one! 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.",

This one focuses on the Brodie boys who really went through a growth spurt.  One (Dennis Quaid) works at a sea amusement park and this is where the shark attacks take place (this should alone tell you not to take the film to seriously).  I actually saw this one at the theater too, so that helps to enjoy the film more as it was rather cool in 3-D and it is the only 3-D movie I have ever seen at the theater so maybe that is why I will always somewhat enjoy it.  The plot is at a sea park like I said and first the team goes after this one shark that was rather puny, then you find out there is a bigger one out there.  There are a couple of pretty good shark attack scenes and I loved the subplot of the people stuck in that pod underwater.  This film isn't for everyone though seeing as how it is ranked as one of the worst so read other people's reviews before deciding to see it.",

            "content": "Mike Brody appears to be totally over the events that struck his family in his youth and now works in Florida's newest underwater attraction \u0096 Seaworld. His brother, Sean is less sure and never goes in the water \u0096 although a visit to see Mike and a new girlfriend help him confront his fear if not get over it. Meanwhile, something is picking off staff and swimmers getting Mike and the staff out on a shark hunt. They capture a small great white and take it into captivity, only for it to die when it is put in too small a tank. They think their problems are over until an examination of the bite marks on some bodies and they realize that the shark that did the killing is much, much bigger than the one they caught.I saw this film as a child but couldn't remember if it was any good or not \u0096 my childish fears may have made it scary even if the film was poor, so I decided to give it a go again recently. The first thing that struck me was the sheer rubbishness of the effects. In the original Jaws, Spielberg had hidden the shark as much as he could because the effects didn't work (and also therefore upping the tension); however here the makers just decide to show anything \u0096 a poorly superimposed image, a rubber shark, fake severed arms and so on \u0096 none of them are concealed, they are all shown up in all their rubbish glory. I could forgive it this due to its age but two other films had already managed to handle this issue before this film so I don't see why they went this route when it so clearly didn't work. Some shots are so bad that they could have been mistaken for being a spoof (witness the shark swimming towards the control room).Of course, after the poor effects the second thing that hits you is the laughable plot. True it is not as bad as part 4 in terms of plausibility but it is still pretty thin. No attempt is made to really give the characters any sort of, well, character and the very basic sea world plot just about manages to give the shark enough high profile feeding scenes to keep the film moving \u0096 just don't hold your breath for any logic or sense. In fact, the opposite is true and this film does deliver some moments that make you wonder what the writers were thinking when they conceived some of this stuff! The manner of Jaws' death here would be hilarious if it wasn't so darn pathetic. Even with the plot being poor the film should still have had at least a few moment of fear and tension \u0096 many of us fear being eaten alive so it isn't hard to draw on that, but this fails to have any tension or excitement to speak of. The effects suck a lot of this out \u0096 but a director who's name is listed in the dictionary alongside the work 'workmanlike' didn't do anything to stop the rot either.Without characters the cast are set adrift with nothing to do \u0096 how Quaid must have envied Roy Schnieder in the first films, at least he was a good character. Quaid runs around the place, Armstrong screams, Putch broods, Thompson screams and Gossett tries to act tough in the middle of a script that gives him nothing to do. I don't blame the cast but I am disappointed that nobody mention how very bad taste it was to make a happy ending out of the dolphins surviving while so many other people had not!Overall this is just a bad film. I'm not a big one for lists so I'll not play that game here but it is pretty much without any value at all. The plot is poor, the effects are rubbish, the direction is weak, the script just a load of nonsense and there is a total lack of tension, thrills or excitement. The original is a classic and this film is further proof that sometimes classics should be just left alone.",

            "review_title": "The better of the Jaws sequels.",
            "content": "This is Jaws' second sequel, which I think is the best of the three following the original movie. The sons of Roy Scheider's Chief Brody character, Mike and Sean, take center stage. Mike and girlfriend Kathryn Morgan are marine biologists at a Seaworld theme park. They discover a baby shark, which happened to be trapped inside the park, and later perishes. To their surprise, the scientists also discover that its 35-foot mother, a huge Great-White shark, is also trapped inside and is hungry; therefore, they try to evacuate Seaworld before any casualties strike.The special effects were bit of a downgrade from the first two movies, with the shark's execution being less realistic and horrific; in some scenes, you could hear the animatronics and machinery that the crew used to operate the animal. Alan Parker did a fine job on the music score, I think, and also incorporated John Williams' famous shark theme.While this film was pretty much slammed by many critics and viewers, even garnering several Razzie Award nominations, I actually thought the movie was exciting and more fun to watch than Jaws II. Having the setting inside a water theme park rather than the usual beaches in a small town is a neat idea, and seeing the Seaworld workers reacting to the idea that a huge Great White is inside the park, where thousands of visitors are, and trying desperately to find a plan to evacuate the park and capture the shark is suspenseful. The acting is descent and plot is fast-paced. Director Joe Alves did a pretty good job making the movie.There are more surprises and thrilling moments, I think, than in the previous movie. My favorite scene is the part where the Great White swims toward the viewing glass from the park's control room, puncturing the glass, letting water rush in and sending every person inside swimming for their lives.Overall, Jaws III doesn't match the original film in fright and shock value, but is what I think the better of the three sequels.Grade B",

            "content": "The Great White goes back into the cinema in this flawed sequel.This bone-chilling movie based on the Peter Benchley's novel and written by Richard Matheson and Carl Gottlieb (screenwriter of the trilogy) , it packs some exciting scenes, thrills, chills and lousy direction. The film is developed at Florida in a seaside park , while the previous entries are set at in New England in a shore community named Amity .There ,people is terrorized by a giant shark that attacks pacific tourists at the undersea kingdom during the preview week. An underwater world that contains restaurant, cafeteria, aquarium and several other things.The sons ( Dennis Quaid and John Putch) of Police chief Brody ( Roy Scheider, Lorraine Gary Jaws I,II) attempt to convince the park owner (Louis Gossett Jr) who reluctantly listen them to close the attraction . Meanwhile the giant shark attacks and the victims run afoul and making a real carnage and those serving for lunch. Then, an adventurer named Phillip(Simon MacCorkindale) and his helper determine to track down and kill it. The protagonists are forced to fight for their lives in a mortal confrontation.It's an inferior following with average creation of tension,thrills,terror, emotions and brief gore. The story gets little relation to first two Jaws, except by father Sheriff Brody and sons relationship. The argument of this gratuitous following is partially similar to \u00a8Revenge of the creature\u00a8(Jack Arnold) in which also a monster terrorizes a sea park. The shark attack images deliver the exciting united to creepy score composed and conducted by Alan Parker inspired on the classic soundtrack by the master John Williams (prized with an Oscar) who heightens the suspense. This below average movie features lousy interpretations of the quintet main star, Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong, Louis Gossett Jr, John Putch and Lea Thompson (formerly to \u00a8Back to the future\u00a8) . Regular cinematography by James A Contner (subsequently filmmaker) and is badly directed by Joe Alves, producer designer of the original film. While the classic picture by Spielberg obtained three Oscars well deserved and today considered an authentic classic, its tree sequels are much worst, and were respectively directed by Jeannot Swarc,Joe Alves and Joseph Sargent in annoying direction. Rating: Bottom of barrel, a real turkey. Only for theaters, its real asset are the 3D digital effects, for that reason in television lost their spectacular Tri-dimensional qualities.",

When the film hit the video shelves, they scrapped the whole thing. Why make a 3-D movie in the first place if you're not going to take advantage of it when it's available for the home video market? The video looked bad when it was released as a rental. Many of the scenes that were shot didn't make any sense or were badly projected. The movie did poorly at the box office and after a couple of years, no more mainstream films were presented in 3-D. The movie itself is pretty bad. Only for die hard fans of the JAWS series.Not recommended, unless they re-release it in 3-D. other than that it's pretty much worthless.",

Having survived the horror of \"Jaws: The Revenge\" once, I decided to see if I could brave this one, though.About the only thing that surprised me was that the premise wasn't quite as dumb as \"Jaws: The Revenge\" is.  And while there is a reference to the events of \"Jaws 2\" at least they don't insult our intelligence with a shark pursuing one family etc. of any \"Brody curse.\" What sinks this film though is that it's dull in every sense.  The FX are cheap and terrible and too often it's hard to figure out what's going on here.  Scenes that could have been suspenseful with a competent director just plod along in a muddled fashion.  In the end, Jaws 3 comes off more as a glorified made for TV type disaster movie with none of the high quality that elevates the original Jaws above such fare.",

The film definitely misses Roy Schneider who was the focal character (apart from the Shark of course.)It's definitely better then Jaws The Revenge which is an absolute waste of time. In shark terms this film would be a Basking Shark, it certainly lacks any bite of any kind. It's a film you watch for a bit of fun, it's hard to take this one seriously. 4/10",

            "content": "I am a sick, sick man. I love hokey, cheesy movies. And horror/thrillers never fail to turn out as such in basket loads. The Original Jaws is a classic in every sense of the word, a genuine edge of your seat thriller, that despite my having seen it 413 times never ceases to make me jump at just the right moments. The first sequel Jaws 2, was just your average, late-1970's rehash, Chief Brody is scared of Sharks, we get it, but not bad either, it had going for it a reasonable number of the original cast and enough of the shark to keep even the most slacked of jaws happy. Jaws: The Revenge (the fourth one) is just trash, stupid and without redeeming value (except Michael Caine, but that is another review). But this little, almost lost gem, is just so great it blinds me as a shining example of how to make a great second sequel without any of the original cast, and being a sequel in name only, Halloween wishes it could the Jaws series, and Highlander, I laugh at you (and not in a good way). A quick rundown of the plot finds MIKE BRODY (son of Roy Scheider, is afflicted with the most interesting aging disease ever, as first he ages too fast, then starts to go backwards), played by Dennis Quaid, who was at the time, near the peak of his cocaine habit. Although to be fair, he keeps it hidden MOST of the time. He was something of a heart-throb in the 80's, and the years since have been kind to him, as he still turns out pretty decent fair and hasn't gotten too ugly with age. He, John Schneider, and Sean Connery should all do a film that compliments their superior genetics. Oh sorry...got off topic for a second. Brody is an UNDERWATER ENGINEER (real likely field of work, given his history, anybody with anything remotely approaching logical reasoning abilities would go and be a farmer in Kansas) who is the leading member of the construction crew finishing up a new addition to Sea World. Lou Gossett Jr. is Calvin Bouchard, an interesting millionaire who owns Sea World and is implied to have dragged himself up by his bootstraps, thus explaining his thick quasi-Cajun accent, and lack of refinement. A lot was made of his being in the film just after his win of a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for An Officer and a Gentleman, but he probably had most of this flick in the can before the awards ceremony (Shark Chow). Bess Armstrong is Brody's girlfriend (fiance) who is also a marine biologist, fortunately for both her and Brody, she has a strange power over dolphins, and that saves them. Simon (Manimal) MacCorkindale makes an appearance as the only person I have ever actually wanted to be eaten by a shark in a movie (and real life too), fortunately the movie doesn't disappoint. We get to see the most annoying member of the Brody men, Mike's brother Sean, who despite having a stated fear of water, spends quite a bit of the film in the water. Keep an eye open for a young Lea Thompson, she dated Quaid for a while after they met making this movie. Needless to say, a shark makes its way into the park, eats a few people (for the relatively few of us who have actually seen the movie in 3-D, it is a pretty neat special effect) and then has to be taken out by Brody. He uses a grenade, borrowed from MacCorkindale's corpse, as it has been decided that the only way for the shark's to go is to be blown to smithereens. Don't worry the dolphins rush Quaid and Armstrong to the surface after the coolest 3-d explosion ever, without worry or mention of the Bends. There is a very special place in my heart for this movie. For some reason I must be the only one, as the next film, just pretends this never happened. Which is sad because this one actually made money at the theaters, and has characters that are relatively easy to care about. Watch Jaws: the Revenge, and you are hoping the entire Brody clan is taken out, not quite the heroes we were hoping for. But this little film is a great time waster. If you don't have a date for Friday night, or if like I once did, you do and she just wants to spend the night with the TV, some popcorn, the couch, a blanket, and you. You really can't go too wrong with this one. It's also a great flick to show the kiddies (I told you I am sick), I showed it to my then 5 year old nephew just before a trip to the beach, and a good time was had by all (although therapy bills are expensive). Get a copy, it's out on DVD (though not in 3-d), make a batch of popcorn, and enjoy your lovely Friday night.",

            "content": "When I began watching \"Jaws 3-D\" I had to laugh. According to IMDB and the film itself, it was filmed at Sea World in Orlando. Well, Orlando is about 90 minutes from the ocean....and there is no way ANY shark could attack there as there are only lakes around the property. I am sure that a lot of other Floridians had to laugh at this as well.The first portion of \"Jaws 3-D\" wasn't that bad. Sure, there were some cheap 3-D tricks reminscent of \"SCTV\" and their 'Dr. Tongue' skits....but the story wasn't too stupid. However as the film progressed, the 3-D stunts got worse as did the horrid underwater sequences and, especially, the plot. We are to believe that a 35 foot Great White shark is angry because its baby was killed (sharks have zero maternal instinct by the way) and it attacks and destroys much of an underwater sea park...and, it growls!! The premise is ridiculous and the whole thing is carried off in the crappiest possible way. For examples, as people are supposedly walking around in tunnels under the sea, it's obvious that the external shots were sloppily added later....and when you see subs and other things under the water, it's obvious they were done using a green screen and VERY poorly added later. On the big screeen this must have been paritcularly jarring to watch! As for the shark itself, despite nearly a decade between this film and the original \"Jaws\", the shark manages to look even LESS lifelike! This is especially true in the ultra-slow motion scene towards the end when it smashes the control room...and ultimately meets its doom. You just have to see it to believe it!!Overall, a dopey movie with abominable special effects. One positive thing, however, about the film...it proves that acting in such a movie will NOT necessarily kill your career or your reputation. Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett, for example, managed to make this pile of crap and still have some self-respect. Strangely, despite all its many deficiencies...the movie still managed to make money!!If you didn't know, this movie is currently #60 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List. I can how it made it, as the list consists of the worst major releases and even after 36 years, folks STILL remember it and hate it. A terrible film.",

            "content": "By now the series had descended into laughability, something at a high with this cheesy 3D take on the killer shark theme made to cash in on the short-lived 3D craze of the early '80s. Immediately we're bombarded with those blocky yellow titles that fly out of the screen and get to watch lots of things fly out at us throughout the film's course. Objects include jets of water, a harpoon, the inevitable shark and my favourite, a cheesy severed arm which lingers on the screen for minutes. None of these are as much fun as they were in, say, Friday the 13th Part III. All of these effects are made hilarious by the bad special effects, which are so unrealistic that it looks like little, if any of the film was actually filmed underwater at all!The link with the previous films is so tenuous that you have to wonder just why they bothered at all to associate it with them - surely a clean break would have been a better bet? This time Dennis Quaid plays the far too-young hero, and it's hard to believe that he went on to quite a successful career after his bad performance here. At least he isn't alone, as just about all of the cast are stupid and unconvincing in this film - with the possible exception of an under-used Louis Gossett Jr, who is pretty cool as the chief of the theme park who has to face up to the consequences of his playing with nature.The people are a clich\u00e9d bunch as per usual - there's the clean-cut girl, the \"risky\" younger brother who gets himself in trouble, two imported British actors as a pair of hunters who plan to trap the shark, plus loads of forgettable youngsters who fade from the memory the instant the film finishes (although one of them, Lea Thompson, would go on to forge out her own Hollywood career). The plot is merely a string of clich\u00e9s, and you can pretty much guarantee that what you see here has been done before - there's even a group of people being trapped in one location with time running out, a disaster movie staple if ever there was one. The rubber shark is overused here too, making it unrealistic and in places ludicrous.The whole idea of a complex being attacked by sharks is done a lot better in the recent hit thriller DEEP BLUE SEA, which at least doesn't take itself too seriously and remains frequently exciting. Exciting is about as far as you can get from JAWS 3, which also totally fails to build up any suspense that its predecessors sustained - here, at the climax, you just think \"that's it?\" instead of sitting back in satisfaction with the previous two films. You may think that the idea of a mother shark coming back to avenge the death of her young is a clever one, but go back twenty-three years previously and you'll notice it was already done in GORGO anyway.Seen in 3D, the effects are entirely primitive and not a patch on those of, say, HOUSE OF WAX, made a good three decades earlier. There's a fairly effective sense of depth throughout, and the underwater photography looks good. The \"jump out\" scenes are less effective and just look fake for the most part, the worst being the superimposed bookending dolphins of the final shot; it's like they saved the worst for last.But perhaps I'm being too harsh. Whilst bad, JAWS 3 isn't quite the worst film ever made. Some scenes are cool - I loved the close-up of the slimy, worm-infested mutilated head we see in one instance, which undoubtedly helped to earn this film a 15 certificate. It's also watchable on a schlocky level, and sometimes reaches the level of bad '70s disaster flicks like METEOR and others. The best I can say about this film is that it's rarely boring (only at the beginning, which takes half an hour to get going). You may think that things couldn't get worse after this, but JAWS: THE REVENGE followed four years later...",

Though I must say it's nowhere near as bad as the notorious Jaws The Revenge.In the space of 5 years the Brody kids have gone from kids to total grown-ups. Dennis Quaid is Michael and he now works at Sea World (one would imagine he would have a fear of the water by now) in Florida. They've just opened up their Undersea Kingdom (y'know those glass tunnels) and ignorant park owner Calvin Bouchard (Academy Award winner Louis Gosset Jnr. at the start of his downward spiral) is so full of himself he doesn't even realise a massive Great White Shark has snuck into the lagoon and plans to munch on divers, swimmers, skiers etc. Luckily for them a renegade naturalist (Simon MacCorkindale from TV's Casuality-looking EX-ACT-LEE like Thomas Jane) is hanging around to convince everyone that getting in the water to torment/trap/catch the poor beast is the best idea. His fate is firmly sealed as soon as he opens his mouth. Which is a bit of rip-off considering he risks his life many times through-out the film and Calvin Bouchard jeopardises so many but escapes un-eaten.The shark coverage is down right terrible. The underwater photography sucks and is badly spliced with stock footage of sharks that look nothing like the clumsy foam rubber monster in the close-ups. The 3-D effects come off as the WORST you will ever see. Even in plain-old 2-D you can see that they were pretty much the most unimaginative and unsubtle attempts at reaching the audience ever. Even the 3-D tricks in Friday the 13th Part 3 were much more fun and natural than this.I first saw Jaws III on ITV years ago. It's best to see it on the new DVD as the 2.35:1 picture adds loads to the sides of the frame for those of you who suffered the pan and scan video. Plus there is a few extra gory shots that ITV and some video releases saw fit to censor. But the picture quality is real nasty with some dirty grainy scenes and annoyingly soft focus others. The sound is simple Dolby Stereo but don't expect any Oscar winning sound mixes this time. Even John Williams shark theme is all but vanished and some guy called Alan Parker's score is generic and unengaged.Extra feature(s) consist of a trailer (methinks originally in 3-D shown before Friday the 13 Part 3 began, in the previous summer). And then there's something Universal call 'Recommendations'. Click on it and what do you get? Still photos of the DVD covers of the other Jaws movies. Duh, thanks! The only interesting thing about this film is the fact that Sea World actually allowed their name and logo to be defamed in such a ludicrous way. Jaws may have been born into greatness but it died very, very quickly as a franchise. Now Jason Voorhees has lasted much, much, MUCH longer and the first Friday the 13th film was hardly a masterpiece.Never underestimate the underdog.",

            "content": "I'm certain if you read the screenplay for this third entry in the Jaws franchise you'd think it could amount to a solid sequel. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with the idea, it at least adds many new elements to the Jaws formula. Where it all goes wrong is in the execution. The acting, direction, and production values are way, way below what they should have been. The 3-D effects are ridiculous. They bring to mind a SCTV parody of 3-D films, with exaggerated tricks that add nothing to someone watching this in regular format. Compare this to something like The Creature From The Black Lagoon, or It Came From Outer Space- those films were 3-D but play perfectly well as flat films. But those were made by people with talent, this film is not.There's also the weird idea of using the Sea World park, but making it a fictitious one located near the ocean with completely different attractions- it's a strange bit of promotional advertising. The real Sea World is quite different, and yet it's shown with all these fantastic elements that are pure fantasy. A better idea would have been to name the marine attraction something original. The scenes somehow come off way more corny and trite than the actual theme park was at the time. The use of the dolphins is a great idea that is staged horribly. The old Flipper show had better shark vs. dolphin scenes.The effects are wretched. In fact, had they worked it would have helped save the whole film from being a waste, but they are totally amateurish, below that of a Roger Corman exploitation film from the 50s or 60s. One expects more from a major studio mounting a sequel to a mega-hit.The actors offer nothing here. Dennis Quaid and Louis Gosset have shown remarkable talent, but none of it is on display here. Bess Armstrong and Lea Thompson are both very attractive, but again they don't really add anything, and Thompson seems especially vapid here. Luckily all these actors are in a film so filled with incompetence that the music, effects, editing and overall storytelling distract from their work.",

You don't get any better than this, and I must say, the acting, the score, and the development, all written with intellect! I do not care what any one says, this film is a true piece of work. With the same type of opening, of a P.O.V. shot in the deep blue ocean, which was missed in Jaws 2, this one has a creepy feeling from the beginning. Admittingly, the first two films preceeding this have it beat in many areas, but not all! The very idea of not one, but TWO sharks in Sea World as its grand opening takes place...is just freaky! Special effects will suffer when viewed with out 3-D glasses, however, the film is still enjoyable to watch. Alan Parker povides the film with a new kind of shrieking score that makes the feel a little eerie as the original shark theme is put to the test, and brought to a new level of scary. What most call boring, is the intellectual discussions that the main characters speak of as they, being adults, must deal with the water crises in the most mature way they can. Different ideas of murder, explosions, and captivity are all the order of the evening as the exposition is revealed. Later, the film takes a plunge when hungry mamma is let out, and all hell breaks loose, literally. Not so much the scares, as the shocks, are what draws me to this film, and every minute is worth while. Never trust the ocean, it is always full of suprises, and in all the wrong ways. Yes, the 3rd demension is pure terror, and Jaws 3-D will not fail to serve audiences with a real bang and boom! 9/10",

This one concentrates on Shreiff Brody's boys--Mike (Dennis Quaid!!) and Sean (John Putch). Mike is working at Sea World--a strange choice considering what happened to him in the first two movies. His girlfriend Kat (Bess Armstrong) also works there. They accidentally (don't ask) capture a great white shark in their man-made lagoon--and it takes a few DAYS before they figure it out! Good thing shark hunter Phillip FitzRoyce (Simon McCorkindale) is on hand. And wouldn't you know that Sean just happens to visit the park at that time? And let's not forget the head of the park played by Louis Gossett Jr. with the WORST foreign accent I've ever heard.There are so many things wrong with this movie that it's hard to know where to start. I did see this in 3-D up a theatre in 1983 (I still have the glasses). The 3-D didn't work at all. The image was dark, objects swam in and out of focus and there was a LOT of annoying double vision. The story itself is just silly. I mean it takes them a few DAYS to locate a great white in a lagoon??? Come on! Also the special effects in this are atrocious--the submersible sequence has got to be some of the worst blue screen work I've ever seen. And wait till you see the shark dummy at the end that isn't even moving! Also these sharks move lightning quick (speeded up film), move backwards (sharks can't do that) and ROAR (sharks have no vocal cords)! And I wanted those two \"cute\" dolphins in the movie eaten so BADLY!There are only a few bright lights here. Armstrong and McCorkindale are actually excellent in their roles. Quaid, Putch and Lea Thompson are OK. The attack on Sea World at the end is actually pretty suspenseful (crappy effects aside) and fun. This gets a 3 only for those things.

The plot couldn't innovate the genre, but the idea of a baby shark and his angry mother is... so childish and imaginative. Otherwise the idea of a shark attack in a aquatic park is fabulous. I think that if they made this movie without the 3D effect it looked better. Sometimes, the scales don't agree, and the \"lake\" looks deeper than it is, for example. The ending, with the mother breaking the control room's glass is... funny (and ridiculous) ...The characters are well performed, but I saw this film on the Spanish version, so the \"dubbing actors\" could act better than the original actors. Because of that, I don't understand why Louis Gosset Jr. was nominated for a Razzie award \u00bf?. The relationship of Mike-Kathryn and Sean-Kelly are convincing.This movie is far for being the worst of the series. it's clearly weaker than the first ones, but...worthy and entertaining.

            "content": "Warning- Spoilers Contained Below\u0097 Jaws 3 was the third film in Universal Studios' shark-thriller movie series. The first film, released in 1975, was a pioneering blockbuster directed by Steven Spielberg. He passed on a sequel, and so Jaws 2 was directed by Jeannot Swarc. Generally considered inferior to the first, it nonetheless made a modest profit at the box office in 1978. Five years would pass before another sequel was made\u0097but perhaps it shouldn't have. 1983 saw a brief revival of 3-D films at the box-office, with minimal results. It was likely presumed that a 3-D Jaws would have more 'bite' to offer filmgoers. It didn't work.This time (directed by Joe Alves), the action moves from the New England town of Amity to a coastal Florida Sea World amusement park. The film damages its thematic credibility early on by prematurely aging the Brody boys, sons of Chief Brody of the first two Jaws films. Now the 30-ish Mike (played by Dennis Quaid in his 80's zenith) is an engineer/designer of underwater tunnel systems, with Sean college-aged and visiting his big brother for the summer. Bess Armstrong is Kathryn Morgan, the park's head marine biologist and Mike's love interest. Lea Thompson is Kelly, a ski-show performer and Sean's would-be girlfriend.Louis Gossett, Jr. (who had recently won an Oscar for his role in An Officer and a Gentleman) plays the flamboyant Calvin Bouchard, a New Orleans-reared businessman who has just recently taken over as the manager of the park. Fishy things start to happen when a great white shark apparently mauls an unsuspecting worker near the park's storm drainage tunnels.Enter Philip FitzRoyce, played by Simon MacCorkindale (TV's \"Manimal\") an Australian wildlife photographer/hunter who offers to capture the rogue predator. He is successful, and Bouchard orders that the shark be put on display to seize on the publicity. His decision is questioned by Kathryn and Mike, the latter of whom knows all too well that great whites aren't anything to trifle with.Soon, the shark specimen dies\u0097however, the recently discovered remains of another shark victim indicate that they couldn't have been killed by the shark in custody\u0097this one would have to be much bigger. Shortly afterwards, the park staff (and their clientele) are face to face with the shark's mother\u0097over 30 feet in length and apparently feeling a maternal revenge instinct. From there, shark mayhem starts happening in a major way, as the murderous predator mauls its way through a ski-show exhibition, the bumper boat lagoon, and floods an observation tunnel. The shark is contained only temporarily, setting up the climax where viewers get to see a slow-motion reaction shot from the protagonists as the shark apparently has the presence of mind to charge headlong into an underwater control room to get at those pesky humans.Quaid is decent enough as a lead and Gossett is always a pleasure to watch, but despite their acting pedigrees this film is still strictly B-grade at best. It is unintentionally humorous that Sea World would lend its brand name to be potentially marred as vulnerable to shark invasion (technically, there are no coastal-based Sea World parks). Perhaps the show dolphins prominently featured in the film (another real-life park attraction) had something to do with the enticement\u0097though it would have been great if at least one of them were sacrificed to the shark. The special effects here are dated, and rendered muter for the fact that the 3-D effect has been removed. Certain scenes show objects heading straight for the camera (like a hypodermic needle, a crossbow bolt, shattered glass\u0097oh yes, and 'Bruce'). Minus the 3-D effect, unknowing viewers may question the odd choice of angles. Everyone except a Jaws completist should only rent this film.",

            "content": "After the success of Jaws and Jaws 2, it was a foregone conclusion that another voracious Great White shark would appear to terrorize filmgoers. Jaws 3-D made its appearance during the misguided resurgence of crummy 3-D in a period running from 1982-1984.This time the action is set at a Florida Sea World-esque aquatic park where a 35-foot-long Great White manages to sneak into the park to gradually terrorize employees and patrons alike. To tenuously tie it to the original films, Mike Brody (Dennis Quaid) is one of the employees and his visiting brother Sean (John Putch) one of the potentially threatened patrons. The film hits some of the plot beats from the original Jaws (although no where near enough of them). As a couple of people go missing in action, Quaid and girlfriend Bess Armstrong begin to investigate the possibility of a shark being responsible. Naturally, Louis Gossett, Jr., is on hand as a park superior who refuses to close things down and calls in daring British adventurer Simon MacCorkindale to help locate and capture the critter. They find a baby Great White that they initially believe to be the culprit until the monstrous mama reveals herself in the latter portion.In theory, setting the action at an aquatic park is definitely inspired and should have been a terrific setting for such a film to unfold. Alas, for all of the screaming people falling into the water (which becomes ridiculous after a while), scant few of them are actually attacked. The effects are scattershot and the film has a real problem deciding on what the shark can or cannot do. It swims backwards (not possible), sometimes it goes absurdly slow and other times at the speed of sound. In one scene, it proves capable of literally swallowing a character whole, while shortly before that it merely is capable of nipping the leg of another character.If you are not seeing the film in 3-D, then you can be forgiven for wondering why the camera lingers on so many unnecessary shots. Truly, even in 3D, they are nothing to scream about. The sequence where the shark slowly swims towards an underwater viewing station and breaks the glass is laughably phony, but then so are many of the effects in this disaster.The screenplay is terrible. It feels like full sections were left on the cutting room floor. There are a couple of attempts at humor that go splat, while unintentional hilarity starts to become the norm. The characters by and large are idiots and their dialogue will test patience. We may be able to swallow that a shark the size of Montana could easily swim unnoticed into the park during gate repairs, but it strains credibility that more people would not notice it hanging around for days on end thereafter. Sean is purportedly afraid of the water, but has no sooner arrived at the park before being paired by with pretty water skier Lea Thompson, who has him taking a nighttime swim in a lagoon and heading out on skimpy floats. The scenes where Putch and Thompson meet and flirt are embarrassingly amateurish to the point where it makes Porkys seem like MacBeth. Ditto, it would be nice if Mike warned his brother at some point that they suspect a shark is lurking around the park, but after their initial few scenes together, Mike seems to forget he has a brother visiting and vice versa. Plus, I am uncertain who cast the roles, but Sean is supposedly a good few years younger than Mike, but Putch looks like Quaid's contemporary or older.Quaid is completely forgettable here. Mike is a total cipher and has pretty much nothing to do. He has no big scenes and is a fairly passive presence. MacCorkindale is lively at least, but one of the great mysteries of life is how Bess Armstrong got any acting gigs during the 80s. The woman is annoyance personified. She delivers every line with the kind of over-the-top can-do bouncing-off-the-walls positivity of Little Orphan Annie on uppers. She has no chemistry with Quaid, is not remotely credible as an undersea expert, and the only time she seems remotely alarmed during the deaths surrounding her is when she fears that a couple of dolphins have been lost to the shark. The less said about Gossett, the better. After shouting his way to a completely undeserved Oscar in An Officer and a Gentleman, it must have seemed like quite the coup to snag him here. Unfortunately, he just demonstrates that he is a hammy liability.The film is a litany of wasted opportunities and missed chances. It does have one huge thing in its favor...it is not Jaws: The Revenge.",

I wouldn't have minded so much the sluggish pace if the suspense and plot were up to par. Sadly, neither are. The plot is both unoriginal and close to being a non-event.The suspense, tension and thrills were what made the original so memorable, there is next to none of that here. The music and direction do not help. The music feels very predictably placed sometimes which spoils the mood of the scene, and the direction feels pedestrian and tired.The locations are pretty good, they're not what makes the film so dull and cheap visually. That's the fault of the slip-shod editing and the rubbish effects, with the shark completely lacking menace and feeling incredibly gimmicky. Jaws 3-D also has some cheesy and trite dialogue and superficial characters that you don't care for at all.The acting is poor. Dennis Quaid has a badly-written character, and sadly in his performance he lets that show. The other actors are either bland or annoying.So overall, while not as bad as Revenge the film is a big mess. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

Joe Alves is a great director and his vision for the film works for me. If I were to complain about anything it would be the lack of people being eaten by the Great white Shark, especially during the water skiing scene where no one die I think at least one person should have gotten the big bite. The underwater scenes were done very well and in 3-D looked fantastic, I think a lot of the bad rap JAWS 3 gets are from those who have only seen the 2-D version, it is a shame that theaters can't do 3-D anymore it would be fun to have these classic 3-D movies pop up at your local Multiplex from time to time. On a final note The soundtrack to JAWS 3 by Alan Parker is outstanding.",

To me, the jaw is more scary in this third part then in the first part for example. You can nicely see his body and its just scary to see how big he is. The plot is also very interesting, about a water park that opens his doors for the first time with some nice people working their that gives the movie a lot of fun times to watch. No stupid characters and some moments are really good like when the shark attacks some of the underwater parts of the park or when the dolphins helps the people fight the jaw. Very nice movie.",

            "content": "It's hard to believe they actually managed to make a Jaws film worse than this.Several years after the Amity Island attacks that formed the original \"Jaws,\" we meet Sheriff Brody's two sons in full-on adulthood. Mike (Dennis Quaid) is a senior executive at Sea World, where Sean (John Putch) visits after college. No Brody family reunion would be complete without a big ole shark to remind the boys and us of their glory days. Forcing its way into Sea World though an unsecured gate, the shark snacks on staff and coral poachers while the Brodies and their babes frolic in temporary ignorance, until it all hits the fan at the park's big opening.The concept isn't that terrible. It's what the writers and director Joe Alves do with it that boggles the mind with sheer stupidity. Watching Quaid and the other actors utter weird inanities that supposedly pass for normal conversation is odd enough, without the wince-inducing performance by Bess Armstrong as the park's whale and dolphin manager and Mike's girlfriend. She seems to have raided Sandy Duncan's medicine cabinet and taken all her peppy pills. Then there's Lea Thompson as Sean's sudden new girlfriend, who thinks nothing of stripping down and enticing her new man to take a swim.\"I bet I can overcome your childhood fears,\" she says, wading into the water in just her bra and panties.OK, I admit, that does sound pretty good. But take it from me, it's not. All you do is watch these cutesy scenes and wait like Captain Ahab for that big fish to show up. When it comes, it's not worth the wait.The shark attacks are filmed in such a ridiculous fakey way you feel insulted rather than scared. You get a rush of bubbles, someone ducking their head underwater, stock footage of some shark filmed in Australia, and that's it. Oh, yeah, and a detached arm, pointing out at the screen to take advantage of something called \"Arrivision 3D.\" The compositions are so stiff it hardly matters.The big stiff is the shark itself, alternately a matte shot of a still image moving with glacial slowness toward the camera, or a rubberized model so fake it actually folds when it rams into something. At one point, we see Armstrong's character wading in a pool with the shark, pretending to nurse it while she actually pushes it around the water like Bela Legosi did that rubber octopus. Would anyone with any ocean sense get in a pool with a Great White? Well, I guess yes if it's more likely to capsize than bite someone, as the case is here.I'd be remiss if I didn't call out Simon MacCorkindale, who plays a roguish English adventurer and gives \"Jaws 3\" its one source of true charm. He spends a lot of time bouncing around acting cocky and trading quips with Louis Gossett, Jr.'s park-owner character, but he is undeniable fun when he's on screen working his proto-Aaron Eckhart vibe so engagingly. He and Craig T. Nelson in \"The Osterman Weekend\" are my 1983 Doe Avedon nominees for giving the best performance in a bad film. But, oh, the thanks poor Simon gets\u0085After devouring several people and 90 precious minutes of your life, the shark concludes matters by smashing into the viewscreen of an underwater control room. It's the most ridiculous shot in a movie full of bad shots, more so as Alves for some reason plays it in slow motion.I think it was slow motion; it was hard to be sure. Everything in this movie runs so slow time loses all meaning after a while. \"Jaws 3\" is such a bad movie it becomes kind of fun in a warped way to see what nutty tricks they pull next, something you can't say of a lot of halfway-decent films held down by competent directors and logical plots. I guess \"Jaws The Revenge\" is actually worse than this, based as it is on the idea of an actual vengeance-seeking shark seeking out the Brody clan. The silly fish needn't have bothered; \"Jaws 3\" did a better job finishing them off than he ever could.",

            "content": "JAWS 3-D gets a lot of undeserved hate. The film isn't nearly as bad as most people seem to think it is. It's actually a fun and enjoyable piece of early 80s cinema. The score is great, mixing old themes with all new ones. It really fits the setting well. Most of the characters are likable, interesting, and just plain funny (which adds to the enjoyment of the film) and the story itself makes for a fine old- school monster movie. A lot of the underwater scenes are dark and grainy but that just goes to enhance the atmosphere and make it even more spooky. All of the actors play their parts well. Dennis Quaid is great as always. Lea Thomson, Louis Gossett Jr., John Putch, Simon MacCorkindale, and P. H. Moriarty all do a fine job. Bess Armstrong is probably the most annoying of the bunch but over time she's grown on me. I don't find her to be quite so bad anymore. Overall, nobody does a bad job. The first half of the film has the reputation of being boring because there is limited \"shark action,\" but to me this is the best part. This is the period that sets the mood and allows us to get to know all of the characters and builds suspense toward the eventual encounter because we know the shark is trapped in the park. By the time the second half starts and the \"shark action\" really kicks into overdrive, everything has been established, the stakes have been raised, and it just makes it all the more interesting. A lot of the 3D effects look extremely corny, especially seeing them in 2D, but that just adds to the film's overall charm. Comparing it to today's slick, ultra-glossy, extremely fake looking CGI and I greatly prefer the old cheesy effects. At least they're unique and charming rather than lifeless and completely devoid of any emotion at all (like CGI). But of all the film's complaints, the effects seem to be what gets the most scorn, and I believe that to be the main reason why the film has the reputation it does. Most people can't seem to get past the peculiar effects. The shark itself doesn't look amazing, but I definitely prefer it to the shark from either 2 or 4. But at the end of the day, I guess the bottom line for all the effects is if you're specifically looking to criticize the film for it, you'll definitely have plenty to work with. But if you're able to just sit back and enjoy the film for what it is and look past its superficial flaws, you'll have an extremely fun and enjoyable experience. The key is to watch this film on its own and not right after the original or any of the others. Let's face it, the original JAWS is not only the best film in the franchise, it's the greatest shark movie ever made and one of the best films period of all time. Most films aren't going to measure up. The second film isn't terrible but it's definitely a major step down from the first and can be quite boring to get through, especially on repeat viewings. The fourth movie (Revenge) is a notoriously bad facepalm-inducing catastrophe of epic proportions. It literally killed off the franchise and isn't worth talking about beyond that. As a whole though, 1, 2, and 4 seem to be the real trilogy of this franchise (though I personally prefer it as 1, 2, 3). As is though, JAWS 3-D is the outlier in look, feel, and setting, but boy is it better for it. It's far and away better and more interesting than either sequel, by a long shot. It isn't boring and it certainly isn't awful. You just have to see it for what it is.... a fun, cheesy, 80s monster movie with uniquely odd effects. If you give it a chance, it may grow on you.",

Dennis was probably all like \"Don't mess with my highlights, man!\" There are shark attacks, and they catch a convenient scapegoat (scapeshark?) shark with the help of Simon MacCorkindale's arrogant wildlife photographer. This shark dies in captivity, and its mum comes to wreak revenge on the park- which it does in spectacular fashion. Does Mr MacCorkindale survive until the end of the movie? Well, he speaks of the shark with disrespect. Underestimates it. What do you think?Sean Brody is lucky enough to meet slutty waterski dolly Lea Thompson, but unlucky enough to be attacked by the water monster the minute he is persuaded to get into a boat.The whole film looks great, and moves fast- and the shark effects are terrific- they use a lot of real shark footage, and realistic models. In fact, this film out of the 4 probably has the best-looking sharks.The 3-D effects would probably be great if you got to see them properly, but unless you're lucky enough to catch a special viewing of the 3-D version, you're left wondering why so many things seem to point suggestively into the camera, and marvelling at the strange baroque effect of non-3-D 3-D, if you see what I mean. Things float around looking weird and disembodied- totally disconnected from the rest of the scene. But it's not altogether a bad thing.For me, this is a beautiful and exciting film- it's like a 70's disaster movie made in the 80's.",

But this 'film' contained NONE of the elements which made its two predecessors great movies. The first mistake made by the screenwriter has to be, his decision to move the story from the open sea to an amusement park of some description (but I for one was far from amused.)The thing that truly frightened me about the first two films was that \"it was out there lurking in the vast deep ocean\" I live by the sea so this was an extra terrifying notion for me. This element is sadly no longer present in the franchise by the time JAWS 3-D rolls around. The Director, clearly has no respect for Peter Benchley or Steven Spielberg, nor does he possess any real skill as a filmmaker, This is apparent in the fact that for a movie about a giant killer shark, there isn't exactly an abundance of shark attacks, in fact, there's about two! No director who respected Benchley/Spielberg's vision would subject his/her audience to endless scenes of meaningless dialogue between characters that we really do not care about. The 'climax' of the film is what really does it for me though, the visual effects are simply laughable as the barely manoeuvrable shark 'storms' the park by smashing a bunch of windows, surely it could have done this earlier and saved us a whole 90 minutes of drawn out waffle. Not only are the effects bad, but the scene itself is just plain stupid. The fact that people underwater appear to be running from a shark, and the man who is eaten does not surface once but somehow manages to scream! Priceless. Well, that's about it. In conclusion, JAWS 3-D is a Turkey worthy of the great Eric Roberts himself, so bad it's not even funny.",

            "content": "Jaws 3 (1983) ** (out of 4) Mike Brody (Dennis Quaid) and his girlfriend Dr. Morgan (Bess Armstrong) are workers at Sea World, which is being ran by the someone (Louis Gossett, Jr.) who always thinks of the business first. A young Great White shark is captured but due to some carelessness it ends up dying and soon its 35-foot mother is loose in the park and wanting revenge.JAWS 3 is in my opinion the worst film in the series but that's not to say it isn't worth watching if you're a fan. I grew up watching and loving all four movies but there's no question that this here is the weakest of the lot due to a really bad screenplay that just has one bad idea after another. I'm really not sure what they were trying to go for but this here comes off as nothing more than a gimmick film to try and milk some money out of a popular series. The gimmick of course is the 3-D, which I can't judge since I've never seen able to see that version.The flat version contains some pretty awful scenes of stuff either floating towards the camera (fish parts) or the camera moving towards items. I've been told that the 3-D effects were horrible and I'm just going to believe them. What really kills this movie is the really stupid screenplay, which is all over the place. The film never fully knows what it wants to do but there's no question that it lacks any suspense or tension, which is what make the first one a masterpiece and the second a good film. I think a lot of the blame can go towards director Joe Alves who just doesn't seem to be able to build much of a movie.It certainly doesn't help that we get so many campy moments throughout. This includes the before mentioned dead parts constantly floating towards the camera. These scenes are really embarrassing as is the ending when the shark comes crashing through a glass window. This sequence really wasn't thought out too well and it just looks ridiculous as does the shark itself during close ups. Just take a look at the sequence where it's attacking the underwater cabin. The shark really does look like a big ball of wax.In a rather shocking twist, I thought the cast was actually the best thing. You certainly like the characters and they make the film a lot more entertaining than it should have been. Both Quaid and Armstrong are very good and they share some nice chemistry. I thought Lea Thompson was also extremely cute in her supporting role. Gossett is pretty much wasted in his part but he does get a few silly lines to shout. Simon MacCorkindale and P.H. Moriarty are also good in their supporting roles.JAWS 3 is a pretty campy and silly movie. There's no question that it's a major step down from the previous two films and I will gladly admit that I'm in the minority and that I prefer JAWS: THE REVENGE over this.",

            "content": "If you are a regular visitor to our site, you may realize that we love shark movies. We have a whole Letterboxd list devoted to them. While Sam's taste may veer toward the ripoff side of the Jaws equation, Becca's heart is with the sequels, even Jaws: The Revenge.After a career as a production designer -- he built the awesome New York City model in Escape from New York -- Joe Alves took his experience on Jaws 2 to make this one. Earning the 1983 Golden Raspberry for Worst Director, he went back to production design for movies like Starman and Freejack.But this wasn't even the movie the producers wanted to make.David Brown and Richard Zanuck, the producers for the first Jaws films, brought in Matty Simmons, who produced National Lampoon's Animal House, and Lampoon writers John Hughes and Todd Carroll to write a script called Jaws 3, People 0. With Joe Dante directing, it would have started with author Peter Benchley being devoured in his swimming pool. The studio didn't want to turn what was fast becoming a joke into a joke and demanded another legitimate film. Brown and Zanuck responded by quitting the studio.Richard Matheson was brought on to write this script, which was filled with studio demands, including needing to have Brody's sons in the movie and a part for Mickey Rooney. The studio heads had never checked to see if Rooney was available so that shoehorning was all for naught. As for anyone from the previous films, Roy Schnieder said, \"Mephistopheles couldn't talk me into doing it. They knew better than to even ask.\" He specifically took the movie Blue Thunder so that he would be unavailable.\n\"The third dimension is terror.\"Yes, in 1983, 3D was back, thanks to movies like Comin' At Ya! Any movie in its third iteration -- I'm looking at you Friday the 13th Part 3 and Amityville 3-D -- were made ala Dr. Tongue, with things coming directly at your face.Back in the days before Blackfish, Seaworld was a big name. Somehow, the producers were able to talk the brand -- specifically SeaWorld Orlando -- into being the location for this movie. I remember as an 11-year-old seeing ads all over the Cleveland park for this movie and wondering, \"Why are they advertising something that scares everyone inside a place that is supposed to be making us happy?\"Young Mike Brody has grown up to be Dennis Quaid, who told Watch What Happens Live that this movie had the biggest cocaine budget of any film that he worked on. He told Andy Cohen that he was on cocaine in every frame of the movie. He and Kathryn Morgan (Bess Armstrong) are in charge of the park, which has somehow allowed a great white shark to swim on in and kill people, including some dudes who are there to steal some coral.Louis Gossett Jr. is also here as Calvin Bouchard, the park manager, who for some reason is best friends with a hunter played by Simon MacCorkindale, which feels counter-intuitive to running a park that is all about the love of animals. Then again, knowing what we know about SeaWorld today, it all makes sense.There are also two dolphin stars, Cindy and Sandy, who were not on blow but have a bigger role than many of the humans, including Kelly Ann Bukowski (Lea Thompson) and Sean Brody (John Putch). You have to admire the stupidity of someone who wants to ride in bumper boats when the deadliest predator known to man is on the loose.Somehow, the stupidity continues to the point where a second and much larger shark gets in the park, which seems like the kind of thing that should get everyone fired and the park closed. There's only one way to deal with this kind of thing: we gotta blow another shark up real good*. Luckily, the 3-D effect is here to show us this in graphic -- and below-average even in 1983 -- detail. You know how some effects look bad years afterward and you attribute them to the fact that the movie has aged? This looked bad in the time it took from filming to playing in theaters.Ironically, this movie has a lot in common with Halloween III: Season of the Witch. Both of their original films were big successes in the 70's that made their directors big names. Those directors didn't come back for the sequels (well, Carpenter did reshoot plenty) and both were directed by the production designers of the original movies. They also moved the location and tried to do something different. While the Silver Shamrock caper is today much more well-regarded, Jaws 3D is still a joke to many.By the way, for all the scorn through at Bruno Mattei for outright ripping off shark footage for Cruel Jaws, this movie had to pay a lawsuit to National Geographic for taking scenes from its 1983 documentary film The Sharks without authorization. Strangely, that makes me love this movie even more.*Some of the entrails that fly out of the screen in 3-D are actually a brown leather ET doll.",

But then, as per the late nineties approximately, we literally received an overflow of inferior and quite often downright retarded killer shark flicks. And now all of a sudden, the aforementioned Jaws sequels actually don't look too terrible anymore. It started in the late 90's with the still traditional but totally inept \"Deep Blue Sea\" and \"Shark Attack\", but then since the new Millennium things really got out of control with murderous sharks popping up in the most illogical of places (like the rivers in Venice, in Tsunami infested areas, swamps, etc\u0085) and \u2013 worse even \u2013 all kinds of ridiculous hybrids and genetically altered species, like dinosaur sharks, octopus-sharks and two-headed sharks. Sigh \u0085 whatever happened to good-old fashioned massively over-sized Great Whites, like in our classic early 80's stinker \"Jaws 3-D\"? Now, please don't misunderstand me, the third installment in the Jaws franchise is still a very lousy film, but at least it's not bad in a frustrating or annoying way. The underdeveloped screenplay, the laughable attempt to bring depth to the main characters, the hilarious 3D effects and all the totally irrelevant padding footage \u0085 It almost feels cheesy and charming in a positive sort of way now. Interesting detail here is that Universal Studios, the mastodon production company behind the Jaws franchise, sued the creators of an obscure Italian imitation for being too reminiscent, but then they were hypocrite enough to steal ideas from the movie they accused of stealing from them! That's Hollywood for you, I guess. The script attempts, poorly I may add, to build a bridge between the previous two movies by depicting the Brody boys (the sons of Roy Scheider) as pivot characters in the grand opening of a brand new Florida Ocean theme park. Mike, the oldest one, works there as the head engineer and his younger brother Sean \u2013 supposedly still suffering from his childhood trauma even though he blindly follows the first cute girl he meets straight in the water for a nightly swimming session \u2013 comes to visit him for the ceremony. Due to malfunctioning underwater fences and unreliable technical staff, the park quickly receives unforeseen visitors in the shape of a great white shark and its offspring. Also in good old Jaws tradition, the park's senior executive initially hopes to exploit the baby shark as a unique special attraction without realizing he puts the lives of hundreds of guests and personnel in danger. When Junior White dies in front of many spectators, mommy goes on a relentless killing and destruction spree. The body count is intolerably low for a shark movie, but that's probably because all the action is concentrated in the last twenty minutes of the film. Throughout more than an hour, we're only exposed to uninteresting relationship issues, dull family conversations and a whole lot of random waterskiing footage. Most of the supportive characters are embarrassing stereotypes (an Australian outback hunter?) and the effects are hysterical even by early 80's standards. Especially the shark's ultimate attack is legendary, as he approaches the underwater control room in slow motion while the people inside just pull stupid faces.",

            "content": "Yes, Jaws 3 is a bad, bad movie. It's even a step down from the disastrous Jaws 2, and yet another insult to Spielberg's original, which remains one of the most enduring thrillers ever made. But the Bottom 100? At the time of this writing, Jaws 3 stands at #71 on the IMDb's list of the 100 worst movies ever made, as judged by us, the users. While the movie was certainly ridiculous, it is NOT the 71st worst movie ever made. Maybe this is just a numbers thing, but if movies like Nightmare Weekend and Graveyard Shift (1987) are not on that list, the Jaws 3 definitely does not deserve to be.What it DOES deserve, however, is a good shellacking for being such a mess. Jaws 3. interestingly enough, continues more on Jaws 2 than the original Jaws. Jaws 2 at least had the sense to go for creating some of the tension and atmosphere that made the original such a success, while things like the shark turning into a run-of-the-mill movie monster were merely by-products. Jaws 3 takes that descent of the shark from predator to monster and runs with THAT. You can see some of the budding ideas that led to Deep Blue Sea (another stupid shark movie) in Jaws 3, as the shark takes on abilities to roar, swim backwards, swim through the reinforced glass and into the underwater control room, hide itself, and basically hunt like a human. The shark acts so unnatural in this movie that by the end I wouldn't have been surprised if it pulled out a shotgun and started shooting at people.On the plus side, they at least avoided something stupid like have the shark smile, but then again they couldn't resist having a dolphin frantically shaking it's head 'no' while a couple of diving humans search the sunken Spanish Galleon, bringing themselves dangerously close to the shark. Please. It's things like this that earn the movie worse ratings from the people than it deserves. Indeed, at least one person has pointed out a goof that's not really a goof. When the tour guide is leading people out of the Undersea Kingdom, it's not the green screen set that you can clearly see, but simply the outline of the portion of the Kingdom that they had been standing in.What no one has pointed out, however, is that when they were loading up poison to shoot at the shark, one person fills a syringe and then squirts out probably half of the poison that had been pulled into the syringe, wasting half of it and promptly demonstrating a massive lack of understanding of why that's done in the first place. You point the syringe straight up, flick it to release any air bubbles from the sides, then squeeze until it squirts to make sure there is no air in it. In humans, a single air bubble could mean a stroke and death, in the shark, the more ways to kill it the merrier. Besides, the syringe was held at an angle, and you can clearly see a gigantic pocket of air in it. I've never given an injection in my life and even I know that.(spoilers) In the movie's defense, at least it had a mildly interesting premise. Mike Brody, from Jaws 2, has grown into a strapping young man and works, fittingly enough, at Sea World. He's got this girlfriend with whom he has a goofy movie relationship, she's the dolphin trainer. Much of the first half of the movie is dedicated to showing a couple of dolphins do a lot of jumps and flips, then they disappear completely from the film during the shark portion, and then are cheered at the end for still being alive. One no name dolphin is munched during the course of the movie, but it appears in the movie only long enough to be eaten so it doesn't matter.The movie is probably now best known for being the first, and only, Jaws movie released in 3-D, a cute effect which does not translate well to video. Given the logistics of providing a home video in 3-D, they had no choice but to remove the 3-D effects and release it as a normal film. I really would like to have seen it in 3-D, because it is clear that the filmmakers put more stock in this effect than anything else in the movie. The 3-D scenes stick out like sore thumbs, not just because the movie stops completely in its tracks every time one arrives so that it can linger on screen and audience members can reach out in front of them and try to touch things, but because these scenes on video are so badly computer generated that it's almost funny. And they were right to put a lot of stock into the 3-D effects, because as is now obvious, without them the movie falls on its face as soon as the opening credits. In theaters, these credits may have jumped off the screen and wowed audiences. On video, they do nothing but cover up the water ski pyramid that you're trying to watch. Initially meant to be the first oohs and aahs of the movie, now they simply get in the way of one of the only impressive things in the entire movie.Another stupid thing from Jaws 2 that is added upon here is that Jaws 2 was a stupid teen horror movie, and this one goes for the same cast of stupid teenagers. Granted, they're all older than the kids in the Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street movies, but consider the bar scene. They entertain themselves by getting drunk and then trying to push each other over in ludicrous games like Standoff, and even worse, consider the scene where Lea Thompson's character, Kelly, is wooed by Sean Brody, who tricks her in a game of Standoff, takes her back to his table, and proceeds to hit on her in the most stupefying way imaginable. The only thing more shocking about how un-charming he is is that Kelly just devours it. With flirting like that going on, we don't need a shark. Humans will go extinct on their own.On the plus side, the following morning provides the only truly funny line in the movie, when Mike Brody offers Sean a cup of coffee ('Just throw it in my eyes, it will work faster.'). Unfortunately, the movie cheapens itself by showing a badly decomposed (and pathetically fake-looking) body of a shark attack victim. Remember the autopsy scene from the original? Not a drop of blood and still leaps and bounds more effective than this. The ballasts attached to the shark are back for this installment, but the spirit of the movies is gone. It is nowhere near the classic thriller of the original, but simply a bad b-horror movie. And by the way, what ever happened to the music??",

True, having the bottom of a submarine disappear into the background and then reappear as it turns around is a sure fire way of completely zoning your audience out of the reality of the film but if it had been in 3D, I'm sure it would've created cheers instead of jeers. I've seen a 3D film at an IMAX cinema and I can tell you it's a joy to behold to see things pop out at you. These things supposedly happen in Jaws 3D at well spaced times. The shark charges at you and glass flies at the screen, dolphins do their jumping and water sprays everywhere and as I've mentioned, a one man submarine swims around on a clear blue, water background but when you're viewing them on a television, it just looks like an absolute abomination, graphics wise.What I liked is the way the action is moved away from the beach and the film goes down a new route; moving away from the cop-come-suspicion-come-convincing act in a refreshing way. What Jaws 3D does do differently that I'm sure it wishes it hadn't consists of numerous things. For one, you don't need to be a marine biologist to know that sharks can't swim backwards. They did so in Deep Blue Sea (1999) but we were given reason \u0096 they were genetically altered; but here, the shark just seems to feel like it \u0096 so it does so. Arguably the worst continuity error in a film of all time. Secondly, the film follows the previous Jaws instalments by having the character bicker and argue for a while; in this case the conflict is distinctly put across through the English characters and the Americans as they talk about what they'll do. The English want to kill it and the Americans want to save it; keeping it for their park. A bit of a misrepresentation, if you ask me.Although there are some glaring errors throughout this film: such as the shark swimming backwards and the fact it managed to break through a pane of glass that was obviously too thick since it's pressurised for being underwater. Not to mention the annoying and cheesy way the dolphins attempt to 'save the day', the film remains as an average action adventure piece that doesn't have brain cells but doesn't need them. People mark the film down for its effects but that's premature since they probably saw it on a 2D screen anyway. I thinks it's fitting how one character says to the other when they're discussing the equipment they use at the sea world park: 'You build it and I swim in it.' The same could be said for Spielberg, his original Jaws film success and its predecessors sequels \u0096 you build in it and we'll swim in it.",

The original 3D effects are pretty obvious, except that in the non-3D version, the ones that were filmed as bluescreen shots look absolutely horrible, while the non-bluescreen ones just look silly. In one shot, a chunk of a submersible boat actually disappears before our eyes. I can only assume it didn't look that way in the 3D version, or they never would have left the shot in.Criticizing the plot seems almost beside the point. I mean, yet another huge killer shark (this makes number 3!) shows up, this time in Florida, where former two-time huge-killer-shark-attack victim Mike Brody just happens to be working at Sea World? Give me a break.I can't imagine why the Sea World people thought this was a good idea. The movie is atrocious, and makes Sea World look just awful in every possible way. On the other hand, if the movie had been really good, it would have made Sea World look like a terrifying place where visitors can easily become a shark's dinner. The idea behind this truly escapes me.I have to admit that the cable-TV version I watched was even worse than it had any right to be, since the filmmakers' incompetence was at least tripled by a horrible videotape transfer, appalling sound, and perhaps the worst pan-and-scan I have ever encountered.",

Well with Jaws 3 (3D on cinematic release in 1983) I had one of those moments.The 1980s were to result in several of these appalling films. (Grease 2, Superman IV, several Cannon films) The premise is quite frankly laughable. You have a water based 'Seaworld' theme park on the East Coast of the US. A Great White Shark enters the lagoon or man made lake of the park from the ocean via the gate that supposedly separates them. It later becomes apparent that a second, far bigger shark (it's mother) is also at large in the park.Characters include the grown up sons of Chief Brody from the first two Jaws films. The park owner Calvin Bouchard (Louis Gossett Jr), Mike Brody (Dennis Quaid), a marine biologist Dr. Kathryn Morgan (Bess Armstrong) and two British actors Simon MacKorcindale and P. H. Moriarty. Discerning British viewers may recognise Moriarty from the likes of The Long Good Friday and Scum. MacKorcindale from the BBC TV drama Casualty.For its cinema release the film was called Jaws 3D and required the viewer to wear some naff cardboard glasses. When watching the 2D version as I did it becomes apparent at certain points that objects come flying toward the camera for the 3D effects. The special effects are poor by modern standards and add to the inadvertent comedy of a film that was released as a horror/suspense production.Certain scenes again made me laugh to myself at quite 'gory' moments such as characters being eaten showing their view inside the 35 foot mother sharks mouth. Where as the direction of Steven Spielberg in the first film and it's music by John Williams were great highlights this film relies on a novice director Joe Alves who is out of his pardon the pun, depth. The music being scored by Alan Parker with only elements of Williams Jaws theme. A film that with a better director and better script could have been so much better (it can't be much worse?).",

I went to see the \"new\" JAWS film...JAWS 3-D (and let me tell you, the movie was just as poor in three dimensions).Bess Armstrong was sure cute, and I had recently liked Louis Gossett, Jr. in AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN so I figured he might add something to the mix. No such luck. Was he the same man who won the Academy Award?I was shocked to discover that legendary sci-fi master Richard Matheson had a hand in this story! It looked more like he used his feet.Seriously, this movie is a badly scripted piece of nothing that comes off as stupid and inane, and the shark effects get worse with every installment. JAWS is one of those great films which never should have had a sequel at all. It's hard to decide if this film is worse than JAWS: THE REVENGE. Maybe...maybe not...If you want to see a similar and more worthy movie, take a look at 1955's REVENGE OF THE CREATURE.",

Three years after the film's release came \"Jaws 2\" which wasn't as scary and effective as its predecessor. Nevertheless, it made money, and the franchise distributor Universal wanted to make another \"Jaws\" film. Five years after \"Jaws 2\" came \"Jaws 3-D\". This time the filmmakers did something different. They threw in 3-D effects to conjure up scares. Why did they do this? I think it was due to the success of \"Friday the 13th Part 3\" which was released in 3-D a year earlier. That movie made money, and the makers of \"Jaws 3-D\" were hoping to cash in on the 3-D craze that was supposed to be big in 1983. During this particular year, a mess of 3-D movies came out. In addition to \"Jaws 3-D\" there was the sci-fi adventure \"Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone\" which starred Molly Ringwald (before \"Breakfast Club\"); \"Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn\", another sci-fi movie featuring Richard Moll (before TV's \"Night Court\") and Kelly Preston (before she became Mrs. John Travolta); the comedy \"The Man Who Wasn't There\" starring Steve Guttenberg (before the \"Police Academy\" and \"Cocoon\" movies); and \"Amityville 3-D\", the third in the series about a haunted house which featured Meg Ryan in one of her early film roles. \"Jaws 3-D\" was the most successful movie of this bunch, but that didn't say much. The 3-D craze didn't go into 1984 like it was predicted. In fact, all these movies got horrible reviews from critics and people stayed away from them. However, I went to see \"Jaws 3-D\" when I was only 12 years old. I really didn't know a whole lot about 3-D at the time. I was told that it was a device in a movie where things come at you. When I was going to see \"Jaws 3-D\" I, along with my mother and a friend were given those special 3-D glasses which you had to wear if you wanted to see the 3-D effects. I put the glasses on, then the movie started. It was one of the most awesome experiences I ever had while seeing a movie on the big screen. I had never seen anything like it. But that was just a one time experience. They don't make movies like this anymore, so I haven't been able to experience a 3-D movie since. \"Jaws 3-D\" is the only movie I ever went to see that was filmed in 3-D. At that time I didn't care if the movie was critically bad and poorly made. I went to see it and had a good time. And on the basis of that one time movie going experience, I give \"Jaws 3-D\" three stars. But (and this is a big but), on home video and on TV the movie is knows simply as \"Jaws III\". The 3-D effects don't come at you on the small screen as they did on the big screen. And that's disappointing. \"Jaws 3-D\" was only memorable for its 3-D effects, but since the effects don't come at you on the small screen, \"Jaws III\" is forgetable. And that's the version you'll be seeing of this movie from here on out. So I can only give \"Jaws III\" two stars.** (out of four)",

Even Dennis quaid did a bad job in this one, if they kept Roy Schneider it would be worth watching. I only gave this a two because it was suspenseful at parts. A part that bugs me is when they say they are going to bait the shark near the end they are saying they will use a live person as bait, but at the end nobody is used and all the shark does is swim at them and through a glass window and tries eating a bunch of people.

The so-called \"story\" is a failed attempt at changing the locale to an aquatic theme park called \"Sea World\" where Chief Brody's now-grown son Michael works. Rather conveniently, two sharks (mother and child?) manage to gain access to the underwater kingdom to wreak havoc.Sounds like it has potential? Forget it. The new shark scenes are sillier than ever, the level of tension and suspense is nil, and the characters are completely uninteresting. The worst served here is actor Lou Gossett Jr., who was so excellent in the previous year's AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN. What a waste. Dennis Quaid plays Mike without much to do, and while his love interest Bess Armstrong is cute in a girl-next-door sort of way, she leaves no impression either. The selling point of the film in 1983 was its 3-D effects, and these look absolutely pathetic on your 2-D home screen.A really, really bad and muddled movie and easily one of the very worst sequels to a classic motion picture ever made. This was followed by JAWS: THE REVENGE in 1987, and as maligned as that next film is by fans and critics, the truth is it turned out a little better than Number Three. * out of ****",

            "content": "On Netflix, the movie is called \"Jaws 3,\" probably because the 3-D effects are so unimaginably bad they decided to forget the \"D.\" Recently, my viewing of the original \"Jaws\" became a Jaws-a-Thon of watching Jaws 2-4 (Revenge). The review scores range, in order, range from 8, 5.8, 3.7, and 3 for J1 to Revenge. If ever there was a proof that sequels are the kiss of death, this franchise is it, and I use the word \"franchise\" loosely. In some ways, Revenge is actually better than 3. At least in Revenge, the shark had the good taste to upchuck Mario Van Peebles for his totally fake sounding Jamaican accent.First, J3 is one large product placement for Sea World. The acting is terrible. Rather than making Mike Brody into likeable quality, Dennis Quaid turns him into an \"anti-character\" that seem to telegraph the message \"I know this movie is a loser; what was I thinking? Oh yeah,...paycheck.\" Lou Gossett has done a better job in far better movies. Lea Thompson's cuteness couldn't save it. The rest are forgettable.Jaws 3 is predictable and boring, and any cinematic qualities are overshadowed by how awful the movie is. The original Jaws movie had the benefit of being the first, but any novelty was wearing thin in the second installment. By 3 and 4, it was old hat. If they would come out with \"Jaws, the Musical,\" it couldn't get much worse.",

            "content": "Michael Brody is all grown up and is now a park worker at Florida's Sea World with his marine biologist girlfriend Kathryn. The new man-made lagoon with its maze of underwater tunnels called the \"Undersea Kingdom\" is shortly to open, but before doing so a great white shark is caught in the lagoon and with some convincing; owner Calvin Bouchard sees it as an opportunity to generate some business for the park. So on the opening day a dead body of a missing worker is found, but Kathryn realises that it wasn't their great white which killed the man. It was it's mother who is approximately 35-foot long and is living unknowingly in the lagoon.Wow, what crap! Yeah it's bad, but despite the negative flack that this film always seems to cop; at least it's watchable trite. For me this is one big guilty pleasure and it's actually my favourite 'Jaws' sequel\u0085 oh my! I think it was the last one I saw in the series (and Jaws the Revenge being the first\u0085 ugh!) Well, the sequels are simply stinkers with the franchise turning into somewhat of a joke (thankyou \"Jaws The Revenge\"). But I thoroughly enjoyed this scratchy and quite corny flick. Actually, the concept for the film isn't too bad, but it's just the execution where it goes awry and the script is a bit of a groaner too. Well really, the rotten to the core special effects is what sticks out like a sore thumb, though it made it even more amusing in it's ineptness. That's because originally the film was released in 3D, but since the images are in 2D is looks quite bad and flat. Who knows the gimmick might have blown me away\u0085 eh, probably not, but I still think that I would get a good laugh out of it. Well it would add more to the factor since the film is simply an unintentional comedy\u0085 yeah comedy, because there isn't too much in the way of thrills. It was just too goofy to be effective with only one or two suspenseful spurts that will raise a sweat, but more so it's plain cringe-worthy and simply implausible.The useless screenplay is pretty thin and dramatically flat across the board, but I give them points for a change of scenery. The film's setting is perfect and it's a real change of pace. I don't know if you can actually call it Jaws' show, since it basically took every opportunity to promote Florida's Sea World, even if there was a shark on the loose eating guests. But it centres more about the park and disaster this whole mayhem plays on it, which in doing so makes us want more bang for our buck. The hysteria and shark attack scenes are reasonably quick flashes and just lacking the killer blow. But I didn't find it too much of a problem.But good gawd the shark looked terrifyingly\u0085 horrid! Seeing a shark close up would be petrifying, but here that's not the case because this rubber, robotic clap-trap was totally unconvincing and incredibly overdone. We just see too much of it and I never knew sharks growl. Oh well, if you can't scare the audience at least you got to amaze them in some shape. It also surprisingly builds up an atmosphere when the uninvited guests go munching and the underwater scenes are done quite well. The time goes by quick enough even with some irreverent padding. But for some people I can see why think its dull and that's because of the lack of horrific terror. The slow-motion sequences were horrifying, though! The music score is simply unspectacular with the trivial main theme making the only progress. The acting seems to be torn to shreds by people, but I thought Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong, Louis Gossett Jr. and Simon MacCorkindale gave modest performances with weak characters.An entertaining B-flick that's not that particularly exciting, but it tried to be different and I still I don't think its that dire as a lot people make it out to be. I don't know if it would make the film any better being in 3D, but the novelty of it would have been interesting.",

More of the shark was wanted, but I would personally say that about the preceding two films as well.Parts of this 1983 flick that are terrible, though, are the special effects, especially right at the end. There is also some poorly done green screen and it, clearly, has a dire cover. There's no doubting this being made was a cash grab, that's basically the only reason to ever go 3-D, but a cash grab doesn't necessarily mean it's an awful film; which this isn't, in my opinion.

            "content": "The plot of Jaws 3 can best be summed up in one sentence: killer shark wrecks havoc at aquatic amusement park. I bet it sounded like a doozy of a pitch back when some studio exec and the writers were talking about a third installment in the series. Imagine it: a brand new set of characters (less money to pay in salary after Schieder turned down a part), a major endorsement from a well-known attraction (Sea World), the idea of one shark in a confined space with lots of sea life and people and the gimmick of 3-D. What could be better?Let's start, albeit briefly, with the 3-D gimmick. That's all it is, a gimmick. Let's face it: when you shoot in 3-D, any future viewing in anything but 3-D is going to look pretty bad. It's obvious no one stopped to think about that in 1983. As I sat transfixed to the television for the entire 99-minute running time, I couldn't help but notice when a 3-D effect came onto the screen. The opening credit sequence, the fish head in the credits, the shark exploding through the underwater control room at the end, shark dentures floating through the lagoon\u0085all right, I'll stop. The point is viewing a 3-D movie in 2-D doesn't work.As if those weren't enough, anyone remotely familiar with the Jaws franchise would be ill to see what it has become. Mike Brody, in the course of five years, has gone from teenager to the buff Dennis Quaid. In the same time frame, young Sean has grown from a lad to a rather strapping college man. How that happens in the space of a couple years is beyond me. And then there's the obligatory mention of why Sean doesn't like the water. Apparently, his adventure in the last film coupled with his father's exploits have made the guy a little paranoid. Wonderful, great, completely reasonable. But, think about it: Mike was with Sean in Jaws 2. Why does he take the job at Sea World instead of staying on solid ground? (Funnily enough, in the next film, Sean will wind up being a cop in Amity, only to meet his fate at the hands\u0085er, teeth, of another shark on the water.)Then there's the little fact of these shark's seeking out the Brody clan after the events in the first film. At one point, I had which shark in the family died in which movie all worked out. That was back when I had more time on my hands than I care to remember. This movie revolves around the 10-foot-long kid shark and the 35-foot-long mother. Extrapolating just a little bit, if the first movie's villain was the father, and the second was a son/daughter, then who, exactly, is after Mama Brody in the fourth? The flipping grandparents? You've got to be joking me. A family of shark's following around a family of people no matter where they go is insanely insipid. I'm not even going to point out the folly of diving into the water where you know there's a shark in the middle of the night, putting the shark on attraction, having an undersea control center and the absurd idea a shark can swim backward\u0085wait a second, I think I just did. I think Louis Gossett, Jr.'s, character summed it up the best: \"We're talking about some damn shark's motha?\" I couldn't have said it better myself.",

To put it in perspective the number 14 movie Scarface also was released threw Universal was allowed to run for 3 months, despite and X rating and only made slightly more money, and was a PR nightmare for the Studio. Why is this?First of all the producers of Jaws and Jaws 2 refused to get involved because they wanted this sequel to be a Comedy. Secondly Joe Alves the second unit director of 1 and 2 (the guy that does all the non dramatic hard work like stunts and sharks) was given this project as a debut. Most directors don't get a big budget debut, so this must have really ruffled the feathers of Alve's former bosses. So we know the rest, it was released, made a bunch of money, and to mend fences with the original Jaws hot Shots Universal yanked it. After all they just wanted the money.And it's really a shame because a lot of hard work went into this movie. I categorically dismiss the criticism about the special effects of anybody who didn't see this movie in 3D the way it was meant to be seen. The arguments that the brody boy's leap frog from kids in Jaws 2 (released in 78) to where they are in this movie (Released in 83) is equally idiotic. Nowhere is it stated or even implied that this movie actually takes place in the year it was released.The cast is Great with the exception of Quaid, who lacks chemistry with Bess armstrong who really nailed her role, so he should have been replaced. Alan Parkers re-scoring is great, and who can complain about getting to see a young Leah Thompson in a bikini.It's a shame politics get in the way of artistic expression, the critics are always there, but supply drives demand, a movie can't be successful if it get's yanked.

This film is not all that worthy to his film, but it is still watchable. For some people, it is a movie that should have never even seen the light of day, but the plot wasn't too bad, and the later DEEP BLUE SEA has a plot that is eerily similar to this one.

The effects are terrible - they might have been better in 3D, but on a TV screen the plasticky-ness of it is all too apparent. The acting is well below par for the big names on show here, with some horrible dialogue thrown in just to make things worse.In fact, only the basic premise of the movie has any promise - a killer shark attacking an underwater theme/amusement park. But the idea, though good, is drowned (pun intended) by the terrible crapness of the other elements of the film.That said, the movie entertained me, but not in any traditional horror sense. Rather I found myself laughing so much at the lame effects, bad dialogue and the terrible liberties taken with physics and shark facts that the movie was a fantastic journey of delightful nonsense. Not so much the Hunting of the Snark, but the Hunting of the Shark! If you see what I mean.There is, in fact so much non-stop nonsense that it gets a bit overwhelming at times. The shark is about as lifelike as a rubber shark can get, but towards the end there are some especially dire effects of the shark with its head stuck in the control room window. The stop-motion animation of the tail is extremely bad - you'll see better on most kids animated puppet shows - and the tail doesn't so much sweep back and forth as just twitch inanely. Of course, how it got stuck in the window is almost as hilarious. In 3D it might have looked OK, but on a TV screen (no matter how big) the shark just seemed to drift up to window with all the menace (and realism) of a bath toy shark. This scene 's hilarity was compounded by the looks of absolute horror on the faces of the control room occupants. Priceless! No matter how much you want to turn off, it's worth waiting to see this scene alone.Of course, the general physics is just as abused as the shark info. A grenade goes off underwater, not twenty feet from a couple of divers and they're not even stunned a tiny amount - no burst eardrums at all. Bah! Who cares if water is virtually incompressible! It won't transmit the shock wave at all! No sir!If you fancy a terrifying journey into horror beneath the waves you'd be better off watching The Adventures of Captain Nemo (well, Burgess Meredith as Prof. Cunningham scared me, anyhow).

            "content": "Ahh, Jaws \u2013 the franchise that began with the birth of the Hollywood blockbuster and resulted in three sequels legendary for bringing the \"Duh\" out in \"Duh-nuh\". It's hard to imagine the second such ill-advised cash-in being the exception to the rule. Indeed, from the tackiness of its gimmicky premise (the film is begging for a midnight re-release now that 3D has eclipsed cinemas to an extent that would knock 1980s producers out of their seats) and value- judgment name-related puns being all too easy (3/10, or 'D' grade \u2013 take your pick), preconceptions of Jaws 3-D are inevitably more akin to a roast than a viewing. Surely, audiences are gonna need a bigger drink.At first, the film's notoriety doesn't disappoint. The hokey script and asinine dialogue (inconceivably penned by Richard Matheson and Carl Gottlieb, from Jaws The First) are barely audible due to the collective laziness of muddy sound mixing and the hilariously uncommitted performances of the cast. Audiences are forced to be so active in connecting the dots to make sense of character relationships, motivations, plot, and causality that it recalls that opacity of a neorealist art film, albeit with none of the artistry. There's also the odd sense that director Joe Alves (helming his first, and, wisely, last film here) has a hankering for the eerie surrealism of early Hammer horror cinema, as each shark attack, after a momentarily tense buildup, quickly devolves into a phantasmagoria of surreal red lights, choppy cinematography and editing, and distorted, echoing sound \u2013 a technique that is, unsurprisingly, far more bemusing than thrilling. So far 3/10 sounds about right. But then, roughly two thirds of the way through the film, there is a subtly discernible shift, as if cast and director groggily awoke from a drunken stupor and collective decided to start trying. Maybe the exhilaration of the film's (genuinely stirring) third act twist (\"there's always a bigger fish\") was contagious, but, before you know it, the film's final third becomes a deceptively engaging thriller. The film's fairly clever \"shark in an enclosed theme park\" premise \u2013 oddly prophetic of Jurassic Park, of all things \u2013 is finally utilized towards thrills instead of an excuse to parade around pyramids of waterskiing girls in bikinis, and the blending of live shark footage and rickety animatronics is even vaguely commendable and seamless, adding to the cursory thrills. Alves' background as production designer definitively comes in handy, as the creative tapestry of underwater viewing tunnels makes for some surprisingly tense and engaging shark showdowns. We're still not even grasping at the gills of Spielberg's classic, but hey \u2013 at this point, we'll take it. Yes, the \"oooOOOOoohh 3D!!\" shots are about as forced and tacky as you'd imagine (as are the script's awkward attempts at positioning the film within the Jaws Brody lineage), but their antiquated clumsiness brings a certain kitschy pleasure of its own. It's also easy to leer at the film as a distasteful ad for Sea World (curiously, the Sea World of the film is a far more elaborate fictitious counterpart, so eager audiences would be disappointed seeking it out in real life). That said, there's something so gleefully subversive about promoting a theme park by advertising it as grounds for a disastrous bloodbath that it's easy to let this slide. For your 'spot the pre-fame star' viewing pleasure, Dennis Quaid is amiably noncommittal in the Roy Scheider 'charismatic blue-collar rogue' archetype, and fun to watch whether ironically or not. Bess Armstrong gives a surprisingly impressive performance as the passionate Sea World marine biologist (it's really a shame her career didn't gain more trajectory \u2013 if she shows this much promise here, imagine her working with a half-decent script). She and Quaid share a endearing, effectively playful chemistry, and by the end it's unexpectedly hard not to root for their romance to succeed in spite of workplace politics and shark massacres alike. Supporting them, Simon MacCorkindale's aping of Peter O'Toole as a cocky wildlife photographer is alternatively irritating and amusing, and Louis Gossett Jr. is fun throughout as Sea World's quirky CEO, while the excellently named P.H. Moriarty generates the film's most consistently genuine moments of emotion as MacCorkindale's grim DP. Don't be misled by the vaguely positive bent here: Jaws 3-D's notoriety as a campsterpiece is merited, but it has a few tricks up its sleeve (fin...?) to boot, and it's effectively Oscar-worthy compared to the deliriously execrable part four. Jaws 3-D is without question worth watching for a laugh, and, if the third act results in becoming strangely invested and even the stray thrill here and there, all the better.

Matheson also explained he wrote the Lou Gossett part for Mickey Rooney originally until Rooney backed out.  Then Carl Gottlieb and another writer stepped in and reworked this script until it became the mess that escaped to the movie theaters!  As Matheson himself said,(and I was at the seminar on horror in the movies that he was giving, and heard him say this) The final script was like a great 3-course meal with manure thrown on top of it; there's a taste of what it could have been, but it was ruined.So don't go asking how Carl Gottlieb could have his name on this mess, ask why Matheson didn't use his pseudonym to excuse himself from this mess.",

Why is it the only British characters in American films are either former public schoolboys with no brains or chirpy cockney geezers ? Oh hold on here comes a couple of Brits sailing into this film , ones a brainless idiot with a public school accent and the other is a chirpy cockney geezer,  Cor blimey guv leave it out . And there`s a geeky guy and a bimbo who are in lurve with each other , I`m only guessing here but might I be right in guessing one of them will end up as lunch ? Without doubt the most unforgivable thing about this pitiful script is the fact it was written by the highly regarded Richard Matheson author of I AM LEGEND\nThe cast are disappointing to say the least but they`re not helped by the director . It should be remembered JAWS 3 was made in 3-D so instead of trying to get the best out of his cast director Joe Alves concentrates on the 3-D gimmick , sharks , dolphins , flames and other objects come right through the screen at you but paying audiences must have felt stupid sitting in a cinema with their 3-D glasses on . Come to think of it a paying audience must have felt silly watching this rubbish even if it wasn`t in 3-D",

Unbelievably, unforgivably bad in nearly every way, the film wastes a really good premise (the eponymous killer shark loose in a Florida water park) through poor scripting, atrocious special effects and forgettable characters.The action has moved from Amity island to Florida's water park where the sons of Police Chief Brody (the Roy Scheider character from the first two, who does not appear here) are working away quietly.  Mike (Dennis Quaid) is a diver and engineer and kid brother Mike (John Putch) is tagging along, whilst going out with a local water-skiier (a pre-Back to the Future Lea Thompson).  The new underwater theme park is preparing to open and proprietor Calvin Bouchard (Louis Gossett Jr) is keen to up the publicity for maximum profit.  Lo and behold, a Great White and it's baby spawn appear, to cause the predictable havoc......The scripting for this is quite dire.  There is too much in the way of technical detail (explaining the how the whole park works, filtration pipes, explosives and what not) therefore the whole story becomes lost and merely a means to serve the audience with shark attacks.The acting for this film is largely forgettable.  Dennis Quaid, Lea Thompson, John Putch and Louis Gossett Jr (excellent in \"An Officer and a Gentleman\") turn in unmemorable performances.  There is no depth, no humour and thus absolutely no sympathy with any of the characters.Much was made of the fact this film was shot in 3-D, so we're treated to a series of totally pointless shots, including the lingering, gory aftermath of several shark attacks and a shot of the shark closing in for the kill, getting no bigger as it moves closer...The shark announces itself right from the start, homing in on a bunch of water-skiers practising outside the lagoon.  Later appearances are oomphed up slightly through a couple of jump-scares, and when the mother shark eventually goes on the rampage, the initial sight of its massive tail thumping on the underwater plexiglass is quite intimidating. \nThe film could have made more use of live action shark shots and John Williams music, as the shark model itself, when eventually revealed, is nothing more than a clunky, toothless lump of grey-brown plastic.  It's final scenes with a sight of a victim being devoured from inside the shark, and the shark dying from an explosion set off from another character trapped in it's maw, are almost laughably bad.Clearly the lamest of the \"Jaws\" series, it was followed by \"Jaws: The Revenge\" which improved on this effort while bringing an effective sense of closure to the by-now worn-out franchise.",

It's up to Mike Brody (Dennis Quaid) to uphold the family's legacy as shark fighters and save the day.I was \"fortunate\" enough to see Jaws 3-D in the theater back when it was originally released in 1983. I didn't care for it back then and, if anything, I found it even worse as I re-watched it last night. There are so many problems I have with the film I really don't know where to begin. I guess I'll start with the 3D. As best as I can remember, the 3D effects weren't overly impressive back in the day. But watching in 2D, they're even more annoying. The floating arm near the beginning of the film, for example, looks just plain old stupid. The rest of the effects are equally bad. The shark is laughable. The shark from the original Jaws, made years earlier, is so much better.As bad as the effects are, the rest of the film is even worse. The film's logic is pretty much non-existent, the characters are pretty much unlikable, and the script is pretty much a dull mess. There's not much here to like. Watching last night, I'm shocked that Sea World actually let the makers of Jaws 3 not only use their facilities for filming, but allowed them to use the Sea World name. Sea World must have believed in the old adage that there's no such thing as bad publicity. The film makes the staff and ownership of Sea World look like a bunch of bumbling idiots who can't be bothered to give two shakes about customer safety.Speaking of \"can't be bothered\", I can't be bothered to go into any more detail on Jaws 3-D. I'll end this by saying that, for me, this is the worst of the Jaws series. I know most people rate Part 4 the worst. While I agree that it's one stinker of a film, at least Part 4 is entertaining.

The acting is atrociously fake, with even the normally reliable Louis Gossett Jr. and Dennis Quaid looking embarrassingly unseasoned. The plot is overly convoluted and hazy, and it takes far too long to get to the shark; in fact, 15 minutes in you'll be praying for the big Great White to charge in and eat everyone in sight.Unless you thought JAWS: THE REVENGE was a cinematic masterpiece, you won't want to waste your time on this one.",

Anyway, once Jaws 3 starts proper we are introduced to Micheal 'Mike' Brody (Dennis Quaid), the son of police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider, who does not appear in Jaws 3) from Jaws (1975) & Jaws 2 (1978). Mike works as the chief underwater engineer at a marine amusement park called Sea World which is dubbed 'The World's Largest Marine Park', somewhere in Florida, as coincidence would have it his girlfriend Dr. Kathryn 'Kathy' Morgan (Bess Armstrong) also works there as a marine biologist. A new attraction called the Undersea Kingdom, which is an enclosed lagoon with transparent underwater corridors that people can walk through, is being shown off to the press & public in a preview weekend. One of the parks workers named Shelby Overman (Harry Grant) dives into the Undersea Kingdom to try & repair some damaged gates, while down there he is viciously attacked by a Great White Shark. Shelby's girlfriend turns up at Seaworld the next day & complains to Mike that he didn't come home the previous night, concerned for his safety Mike & Kathy dive into Undersea Kingdom's lagoon to look for him. While conducting their search they are attacked by a Great White Shark but both manage to escape unharmed. Back on dry land a cocky adventurer named Philip FitzRoyce (Simon MacCorkindale) wants to destroy the Shark & film it, but Kathy wants to capture it & persuades Sea Worlds owner Calvin Bouchard (Louis Gossett Jr.) that it would be good for business to have a Great White Shark as an attraction. They successfully capture the Shark but it dies soon after & that makes it's enormous 35 foot plus Mother very unhappy. With an entire amusement park & lots of people to terrorise no one in the water is safe as she seeks revenge...Directed by Joe Alves who was the production designer on the first two Jaws films I quite liked Jaws 3 even if going by some of the reviews & comments most people seem to think that it's just about the worst film ever, well forget about that as it's nowhere near. I will openly admit that the script by Carl Gottlieb, Micheal Kane & Richard Matheson isn't the best ever but it moves along at a fair pace & I liked the setting & overall story even if it's complete total & utter nonsense in a factual & scientific sense. Sharks don't swim backwards, they definitely don't growl or roar & have no maternal instincts towards their young. I suppose you have to take the good with the bad if you know what I mean, & it is just at heart a horror film after all isn't it? Director Alves unfortunately fails to create much tension, excitement or atmosphere during the infrequent Shark attacks although I love the way FitzRoyce was eaten/crushed with the camera placed in the back of the Sharks mouth showing us what we would see if we were being eaten, a really cool & memorable scene that's probably worth an extra star or two on it's own. Alves also fails somewhat when it comes to the dramatics out of the water with the human cast, the relationships & characters aren't that interesting. The shots which are supposed to use the 3-D effects are fairly obvious & as a result I felt one or two bits here & there looked a little out of place, having said that I quite liked the odd strange shot especially when the Shark was blown to pieces at the end & it's teeth & gums shoot towards to camera! The special effects in Jaws 3 are pretty poor, some of the optical effects are absolutely awful in particular the mini submarine underwater & the Shark 'gliding' towards the control room at the end as it breaks the glass in another obvious 3-D shot. Surprisingly there are a few good gore scenes in Jaws 3, a severed arm & some quite graphic shots of a mutilated body complete with a sea creature sliding out of it's mouth. The huge mechanical Shark looks good for the most part, especially it's mouth & teeth. Technically Jaws 3 is OK apart from those poor optical effects, nothing outstanding but nothing too bad either. John Williams unforgettable theme is used at times but the rest of the music by Alan Parker simply can't come anywhere near to matching it. The acting is OK by all involved even if they don't seem to be putting too much effort into it. Overall I quite liked Jaws 3, it moves along at a fair pace & kept me entertained for it's 100 odd minute running time without too much trouble. So what if it's all rather silly, it's only a film after all right? In my humble opinion Jaws 3 definitely doesn't deserve to be in the IMDb's bottom 100 & is certainly worth watching if you can bag a cheap copy from somewhere or catch it on T.V. for free.",

            "content": "Jaws 3 is directed by Joe Alves and features a screenplay written by Carl Gottlieb & Richard Matheson from a story by Guerdon Trueblood. It stars Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong, Simon MacCorkindale, Louis Gossett Jr, John Putch & Leah Thompson. The second sequel to Steven Spielberg's Jaws, this was originally released in the 3D format that had a brief rebirth in the early to mid 1980s. Plot centres around a WaterTheme Park coming under attack from a great white shark.It was originally mooted to have been a spoof movie, along the lines of Airplane et al, now that could have worked you feel, what we actually get is an unintentional spoof movie that was made in appallingly bad 3D. Yet the 3D gimmick was enough to get the punters into the cinema and keep those tills kerchinging to the point where Universal Pictures were rather happy. Happy enough to green light another sequel, the god awful Jaws: The Revenge in 1987. As I was one of those punters who shelled out for the 3D Jaws experience back in the day, I feel partly responsible for part 4 assaulting the eyes of everyone who has ever seen it.Watching it now over 25 years later in 2D, the film is actually worse than I originally remember it being. Of course now in this internet age we can find out about the numerous script tamperings that went on with it, and subsequently look at the non directing career of Alves post this fishy garbage and fully understand why. Perhaps the biggest mystery of all is how Messrs Quaid, Gossett Jr & Thompson survived to have careers afterwards? But the reality is it's not their fault, Quaid is badly underwritten and a bit too fresh faced to carry the male lead role this early in his career, Gossett Jr actually does OK in the role of SeaWorld park manager Calvin Bouchard, showing the only moments of acting gravitas as he tries to keep things under control. While Thompson is a third arc character called on to look pretty and say a couple of lines whilst trying to keep a straight face.Even if we shy away from the poor effects work, that were, yes, poor effects even in 1983, Jaws 3 has an amateurishness about it that is laughably bad. The shark sequences look like they were filmed in a bath tub with some kiddies drawing used to scale, while the dialogue, too, seems to have been lifted from a 4 year old's memoirs. Then there is the performances from the likes of Armstrong and MacCorkindale, the former is bland beyond compare, the latter is, if you pardon the pun, wetter than a fish's blanket. There's some decent choreography on show for some water skiing sequences, but even these are countered by the ineffective use of the shark. Don't believe anyone who tells you that this is still fun in a popcorn no brain kind of way, it isn't. It's as bad as its reputation says it is and it's only saving graces are Gossett Jr and that it isn't as bad as part 4. 2/10",

Basically the Brody brothers, Michael 'Mike' (Dennis Quaid) and Sean (John Putch), sons of Amity Police Chief Brody, are working at seaside park Sea World with its aquarium based attractions, and run by Calvin Bouchard (An Officer and a Gentleman's Razzie nominated Louis Gossett Jr.). Sean meets Kelly Ann Bukowski (Back to the Future's Lea Thompson) and Michael's girlfriend Kathryn Morgan (Bess Armstrong) who work with the two dolphins Cindy and Sandy (Razzie winning \"Shrieking Dolphins\"), and do their parts to keep the place going. Soon enough Sea World, with its new underwater glass tunnels is endangered by a baby great white shark and decide to catch it to put on display, but it soon dies after not great treatment. They realise that the recent attacks in the open, caused by a shark, couldn't have been made by this baby, they are now on the lookout for the large mother that killed Shelby Overman (Harry Grant). It soon shows up and traps many visitors and the water park staff inside the leaking underwater dome, and the only way to kill the shark is to do the same as the previous film, electrocute him and have his jaws come towards us. Also starring Simon MacCorkindale as Philip FitzRoyce and Lock, Stock and Two Barrels' P.H. Moriarty as Jack Tate. Once again the shark, the rubber one nicknamed Bruce, doesn't scare you anymore, and even with the tell-tell signs that this film sued to be in 3D, like the shark crashing into the glass with shards coming towards you, it is just stupid. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Director for Joe Alves, Worst New Star for Worst Screenplay, Worst Picture and there was a Worst Career Achievement Award for Bruce the rubber shark from all three films.

When the body of one is found, it becomes apparent that another great white is on the loose, and it wants revenge for the death of its child. Soon everyone is in danger from the shark, and it is bigger and badder than all others.Poor acting, weak dialogue, pointless scenes (all the 3D stuff), dodgy effects (which embarrass the viewer-strange when we watch the original and the bad effects in it have little...effect on us), no scares or real laughs, and very few memorable moments. None of the actors are given a chance because of poor writing, strange because the idea behind the film could have worked, even if it did not have the same impact as the first. A shark attacking an underwater theme-park, the possibility of children, old and young people all being threatened, trapped under the sea by the animal, all their possible fears, prejudices coming out etc. Unfortunately the film avoids this, throws in some dolphins, a bit of stupid looking gore, and another hunt for the shark. A bad film, but watch it anyway if you're even a semi-completist.4 out of 10",

            "content": "It's the early 1980's. Horror cinema is beginning to see a new light, in particular, the slasher film movement, where iconic franchises such as Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and Halloween are being born. According to the documentary Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film, every studio, big or small, was pressing their luck on the silver screen when it came to slasher films. They were a huge attraction for young teens who needed a good scare on a Friday night. Consequently, many random slasher films came out (IE: April Fools Day Happy Birthday to Me) and many sequels to other horror films came out.This is where Jaws 3 comes in. I only make note about slashers because Jaws 3, in particular, reminds me more of a slasher film than anything else. For one, its pacing is reminiscent of one of the early Friday the 13th films in terms of being very slow (only this time, it doesn't amount to anything remotely frightening), and, to compare it to Friday the 13t: Part 3 - the infamous 3D chapter of the series - it's one gigantic gimmick to showcase its 3D effects. So what happens when you take away that gimmick, like when Jaws 3 was down-converted in the process of its home video release? At the time, VHS and Betamax, the two formats during the film's release, couldn't manage 3D capability, so as a result, the medium that made Jaws 3 different from many horror films was suddenly taken away and what was left was nothing but a bland, interchangeable affair, with poor special effects, little pacing, and the power to be forgotten hours after being viewed.The story, for the first time, takes place away from Amity Island and is now at SeaWorld, where underwater tunnels are being constructed for a new exhibit. Employees, including marine biologist Kay Morgan (Bess Armstrong) and Michael Brody (Dennis Quaid), discover that a baby shark has slipped through one of the underwater tunnels and may be responsible for several disappearances in the park. Upon being captured, more still disappear, and it becomes clear the real killer was the mother great white shark and not her offspring. This sends the SeaWorld staff into a panicking frenzy, unsure of what exactly to do about their shark problem.The one common criticism I have for all of the Jaws sequels is their slowness in progression. In the first film, the shark didn't appear until roughly the hour mark, giving us time to acquaint ourselves with the staff of the beach, the area of Amity Island, and be smitten with Spielberg's clear direction and Verna Fields' priceless editing. In the sequels, the time between the opening credits and the first time we saw the shark is nothing but bloated filler; the film giving us an illusion that it has characters to care about, places to go, suspense to have us experience, and tension in its scenes. They have nothing. Even when they look like they do, they still flounder under the emptiness of their own screenplays. The times the shark wasn't on screen, I wanted to see one. The times they came on screen, I simply wanted the film to end.Jaws 3's most fascinating feature, however, is not its inclusion of 3D, or its release history. It's that the man credited for the story is a man by the name of \"Guerdon Trueblood.\" Starring: Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong. Directed by: Joe Alves.",

This third instalment in the \"Jaws\" family is entertaining, if somewhat tripe in its handling of the subject matter. Despite being an absurd looking shark imitation, the sight of the great dorsal fin breaking water beside oblivious skiers, together with the signature pulsating rhythm of the theme music, still manages to send shivers down the spine.The young Brody kids (Dennis Quaid and John Putch) from the first two episodes have returned, now adults enjoying some catch-up at the recently revamped Sea World Resort, where the older brother (Quaid) works alongside his love interest (Armstrong). However their merry reunion is short-lived when a young Great White shark is discovered in the waterpark's lagoon. After an attempt to catch and conserve the shark in captivity fails, they soon discover that mother is also in the park, and not at all pleased at the exploitation of junior.Despite some amateurish-looking performances in the minor roles, and the occasional inane dialogue, this remains a mostly suspenseful and exciting third entry in the quartet, still capable of invoking a primal fear of the water. And in case you were wondering, there's a particularly graphic attack scene and aftermath (check out the inventive make-up effects employed) that should impress.",

One day, the staff catches a shark and things begin to take a turn for the worse.

I see nothing wrong with that apart from the fact that the shark still doesn't manage to kill anyone. A problem he suffers from the entire movie actually, you'd think giant sharks can outswim people but apparently not. This shark is pretty goddamn lazy. A bunch of people fall into the water right in front of him, they all make it. Unbelievable.Okay, I can't really be fair about this movie because I never watched the movie in 3D.

            "content": "The opening credits read \"suggested by the novel, Jaws, by Peter Benchley\". Exactly what part of his novel inspired this low rent monster flick? Anyway, despite being written by the original screenwriters of the first two films, Carl Gottlieb and Howard Sackler, this has nothing to do with Jaws I or II. It is largely a mediocre throwback to 1950s monster movies, even released originally in 3D, which only makes it seem even more like a 1950s B-movie. One gets the feeling, however, that even in cinemas, in 3D, the effects were largely unnoticeable; I forgot that it was originally filmed in 3D, except for when Jaws' jaws come flying at the screen during the climax, and two or three times dolphins are shown jumping out of the water toward the camera, in an incredibly cheesy, 1970s greeting card type of montage. Shark and mommy shark on the loose at Sea World(!) and a cast of soon- to-be-famous people have to do battle with them, blandly and boringly. Lea Thompson is cute in this, her first film role, but apparently the filmmakers didn't think much of her, because after receiving a bad cut on her leg at the climax, her character is never mentioned again. Simon MacCorkindale was clearly unfamiliar with his lines of dialogue, as he obviously stutters and stammers his way through them several times. The plot is only mediocre, in a campy, so-bad-it's-good way; the same can be said about the effects. The climax is a low rent rip off of the first film's ending: instead of large yellow barrels, and a canister of compressed air exploding to kill the shark, this time we get tiny yellow grenades to explode and kill the shark, and wake up the dozing audience members. Truthfully though, this isn't quite as awful as its reputation has it. I probably prefer this film to Jaws II, slightly. It's lame, but at least they didn't just try to copy the first film as closely as possible, like they did with part 2. And again, it is slightly amusing, in a 1950s monster movie/ so-bad-it's good type of way. But unless you're into that sort of thing, you'll quickly be bored to tears.",

Despite being years after the original the shark looks worse and to top it off there are some sequences that have been sped up and others that are in slow motion- it looks ridiculous and is an attempt to make up for a lack of quality shots or effects. The crowning (poor) moment is a shark towards the end that moves so slow and so fake towards our \"heroes\" that words fail me, just as all those who worked on this film failed their audience.

Jaws 3D proves that this isn't actually the case, with tension and scares in short supply thanks to the cheesiness and predictability of the script, and ham-fisted direction from Joe Alves (whose directorial career started and ended with this film).On the flip side, it is this very cheese factor that ensures a fun time for fans of schlock horror, with countless objects (including torn and mangled body parts) thrust into the audience's lap at every opportunity, truly laughable special effects, and some terrible performances (Simon MacCorkindale and P.H.

A better movie probably could have been made utilizing the basic premise, but these filmmakers aren't up to that challenge. The dialogue and the characters are just not that interesting, and the movie doesn't start to cook until past the hour mark. It may be unique for this franchise in its attempt to cash in on the resurgence in 3-D cinema during this time, but the effects are pretty damn laughable most of the time. Debuting first unit director Joe Alves, the production designer and second unit director on the first two movies, proves to be out of his depth here, and thereafter returned to what he did best.Police Chief Brody's eldest son Mike, now played by Dennis Quaid, is currently working at Florida's Sea World where he's romancing head biologist Kathryn Morgan (Bess Armstrong). As he is visited by his baby brother Sean (John Putch), an enormous shark slips inside the park gates, nibbling on an occasional victim before eventually making her presence known to the public.Co-written by Carl Gottlieb, who also co-wrote the first two movies, and none other than Richard Matheson (based on a story idea by Guerdon Trueblood), although Matheson would later charge that script doctors ruined his original premise. The actors are all reasonably likable, with a lovely and adorable Lea Thompson making her feature film debut and Louis Gossett Jr. offering a very amusing take on the \"entrepreneur\" character Calvin Bouchard. Simon MacCorkindale is likewise a hoot as the somewhat smarmy documentarian. John Williams's iconic score is appropriately utilized once again, with new compositions courtesy of Alan Parker.If there is one nice touch here, it's the added threat of Sea World customers trapped in underwater tunnels that have been weakened by the sharks' rampages.This kills time agreeably enough, if the viewer isn't too demanding.Five out of 10.",

Even worse than Plan 9 From Outer Space- at least that one had some unintentional laughs (not that this one didn't, they were just so few and far between, thus not worth the effort). Even John Williams' theme (first used nearly a decade earlier) seems out of place in this utter drivel, (tip for filmmakers, never use suspenseful music during a bright, crowded summer afternoon when nothing's gone wrong). The 'Jaws' series has since become somewhat of a joke, mostly due to Richard Dreyfuss leaving after the first film, and Roy Scheider after the second (excellent career moves by them, though neither of them have much of a career any more).\tThere isn't a single scare, bit of suspense, or interesting part in the entire 98 minute time burner, or 70 minute for me- I did the smart thing by shutting it off part way through. The talented Louis Gossett Jr. can't even help the film, both him and Dennis Quaid (who likely wouldn't watch the movie if his life depended on it) are given parts written so poorly you just have to stop and wonder what the writers were smoking.\tMy advice is to steer clear from this mess, if you had any brains in the first place you wouldn't even be looking at this comment.Really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really bad.

Needless to say, he becomes quite unsettled when his girlfriend \"Dr. Kathryn Morgan\" (Bess Armstrong) suggests capturing the great white for viewing purposes. Calvin approves of the idea but what he doesn't know is that its mother has also followed it into the lagoon--and she is much bigger. Now, as far as this particular \"Jaws\" sequel is concerned I have to say that it doesn't compare favorably to either of its two predecessors for the simple reasons that it was dull, predictable and lacked the necessary suspense. Additionally, this movie tried to capitalize on its 3D effect but unfortunately it doesn't translate to video or television. In short, unless a person really loves shark movies I would stay away from this particular one. Accordingly, I rate it as below average.",

One of the film's greatest factors is that the characterization scenes aren't all that aggravating to sit through. The bar scenes and the few scenes with the couples on the job are decently done, giving off a nice sense that a normal couple could be involved in these types of affairs without being forced into them. The action does come along at the end in all the right installments, featuring a lot of big action set-pieces that come off really well at first with the brief first attacks as well as the great encounter in the lagoon when they first encounter with the smaller shark. The discovery of the mother starts the film in earnest as the sight of the shark appearing in front of a panicked crowd of tourists and crashes into their structure has delightful possibilities, and they are somewhat played nicely here. The race to fix the stranded visitors is a nice suspense-builder, coming off in a very elegant manner and allowing for some really nail-biting scenes following the shark attacking the complex itself providing some nice action. The chase through the underwater ship is pretty nicely done and comes off with a great air of urgency about it. The shark in here also looks the closest to a real shark, giving off a realistic shape that is really close to a great white rather than a demonic face with a shark's body. It also displays a realistic touch by moving its upper lip to attack, something that none of the other sharks did. This wasn't all that terrible as there actually isn't that much to really dislike in this one. Most of what's wrong with the film is that the effects are pretty abysmal in general. The 3D effect isn't employed beyond poking objects into the camera for no reason, while the green-screen photography present also doesn't help matters, often times making them look worse. There's no believability at all in hardly anything in the film, especially the young, lifeless shark and this really hurts the film. It's nearly impossible to have any fear or tension in a film where the main threat isn't imposing, and it's on display nearly every time there's a shark on-screen here. The stupidity inherent in so many situations is a major crime, especially the shark's capture and display to the public being quite obvious and wouldn't play out in real life. The measure of taking out the creature also applies, as it really defies logic and in a scene full of nonsensical things, it's hard to pick one thing about the ending that really works. The shark itself deserves mention, as the body count in here is really unacceptable. For a giant shark to cause as much damage and mischief as it does, to be around as many thrashing bodies in the water as it always manages to be around, and the fact that it sneaks up on the victims isn't going to be left out. There should've been more kills in here, and with so many missed opportunities, it's a real shame. These are the main things involved with this that really bring it down.Rated PG: Graphic Violence and Language.",

After a small great white is abused at the park the shark's 35-foot mama ain't too happy about it. Louis Gossett Jr. plays the park manager while Simon MacCorkindale plays a publicity-obsessed oceanographer/filmmaker.I'm glad they changed the location from the fictitious Amity Island (shot on the island of Martha's Vineyard) to an entirely different locale because the whole Amity Island scenario had run its course. SeaWorld in Florida makes for a great location and all-around change. The whole first act is good but the movie starts to falter in the second act and barely makes up for it in the third. Moreover, some of the effects are questionable, not to mention the dubious depiction of a guy inside the shark's mouth. Still, this is a decent sequel in the series with a refreshing cast. It's not nearly as bad as some say.Lea Thompson is young & fetching, even though I was never that enthralled by her, physically speaking, but she has that typical charismatic sparkle in her eyes.

            "content": "When Hollywood decides to make a sequel, it doesn't try to lose money in the deal. Yet, many times the moguls are wrong and sequels don't fare well at the box office. Once in a while they have a big hit. More times than either of these, the sequels will fare well, or good enough at the box office, even though they may be far inferior films. And sometimes, a sequel will be terrible and still do well with audiences. That's okay with the movers and shakers in tinsel town because making money is mostly what making movies is all about. \"Jaws 3-D\" is in that category of quite bad sequels that nevertheless did quite well at the box office. It may not be too surprising, considering the subject matter and the enduring aura from the original film, just eight years earlier. And, to some extent, considering some intrigue and enjoyment from \"Jaws 2\" in 1978. Maybe the 3-D angle was the biggest push for making a second sequel. But this film fails in all aspects except a couple of scenes with the shark. If that were the only reason for watching this film, and the rest of the script could be trashed, it might score a 5. But the acting by everyone in this cast is horrible. It ranges from the melodramatic to the infantile to the forced and amateurish. The script is terrible. The idea for the plot is okay, but the screenplay just doesn't build an aura of suspense and worry about where the beast will strike or appear. Enough said. This is a very forgettable film. As bad as this one is for intrigue, characters and acting, Hollywood yet did one more - looking at the box office from this one. But \"Jaws 4\" in 1987 did not recover its budget in the U.S. and just earned a little worldwide. That probably put an end to the efforts to try to capitalize on a singular fantastic fright movie from 1973. Many of us who enjoyed the original scary thriller are happy that Hollywood finally has had its fill of great white sharks. How about a giant octopus movie? It's been a few decades since the sci-fi folks at Hollywood made one of those.Here's the only humorous line in the movie.

Needless to say the 3D gimmick back then was even more of a hacky trick than it is today. At least in today's 2D versions, I can't tell where the 3D effects would be, unlike the corny scenes in Jaws 3 that are obviously filmed for 3D effect. I may have liked this film much better if this wasn't the case since it had loads of potential. Dennis Quaid as Michael Brody was tremendous and stood out in the film as a great lead actor. Bess Armstrong was pretty good too, otherwise the remaining supporting cast was bland.The plot was fair but the whole branding of SeaWorld kind of left a bad taste in my mouth. Considering SeaWorld is a corporation that at the time in the 1980's had a very likely chance of treating animals poorly. Just like in Part 2 with the sailing scenes, there was a lot of fluff scenes that was basically performances by the SeaWorld staff. A lot of the plot premises were too unbelievable and some of the decision making by the characters didn't make a whole lot of sense. The ending was by far the worst part of the movie, not because of the storyline but from the 3D filmmaking and terribly fake looking death scenes.

The movie never gets into any excitement or drama cause it's way too slow and way to caught in telling the very uninteresting stories of the characters.

The film drags incredibly, the story just isn't there, virtually nothing happens for the first 70 minutes or so. Ahh, this movie just completely stinks.The other star I give for it's stars. Though this a definite low point for everyone concerned they do their jobs well. Dennis Quaid is always likable and I've always liked Simon MacCorkindale somewhat, got used to seeing him in Falcon Crest, I recall. Or was it Dallas?, hell, I don't know. And finally Louis Gossett Jr. plays his ridiculous role well, only one year after picking up the Oscar for An Officer and a Gentleman. This would be like Russell Crowe going from A Beautiful Mind to Dude, Where's My Car.",

            "content": "My Take: Suffers from horrible 3-D effects, this lame-brained sequel was actually quite amusing. (This is an extended version of the review I wrote on February 2007)JAWS goes from classic to just plain camp. JAWS 3-D is actually entertaining for more than just its campiness, but that's just generally why its mildly entertaining. Although this dreary series slowly hitting the dump, this one is actually quite a guilty pleasure. I've heard some pretty bad reviews about this sequel. That's simply too bad, I quite enjoyed this one, depending on how you view it. It has a real twist from the first two. This shark doesn't terrorize Amity like the first two. This one takes place in Sea World (not the one in Florida which we know and love). The shark is bigger than the usual and is wrecking havoc on a grand opening ceremony when her infant, who was captured and kept in the park, died recently. Now throw in some ridiculous scare tactics and it's an amusing film, granted not a great one, but certainly deserves even a little bit of merit. By the looks of it, it hardly bears resemblance to its predecessors, except that it features Mike Brody, played by Dennis Quaid. The film co-stars Louis Gossett Jr. giving an over-the-top performance, but as far as I can see he is the only good performer. The special-effects are terrible (not good then, just plain laughable now) but there are some really good moments and the ending with the shark is superb (even if the effects are amateurish even for 80's standards).Not as bad as they say, if only for its camp value. Watch out for that fake shark crashing through the glass! Rating: ** out of 5.",

A few scenes I was laughing my head off and when the shark smashes into one of the rooms, I was honestly laughing with tears. It was too funny at how bad and cheesy the acting and effects looked. The movie is simply garbage. My grandmother is more scarier than this. Honey Boo Boo is honestly more of a horror compared to this. This was an awful film. I would rather watch Sharknado.

I guess you could consider views on the actual movie industry to be political ones. They include stuff about censorship, special effects, etc. I will always remember at how he was against 3-D. He kept making article after article about how he was tired of it. 1983 saw a resurfacing of 3D that came from the 1950's. There were many third installments in series that were 3D and this is one of the worst. It's pretty easy to see that this was just a cheap gimmick and you can comprehend how it died off in this decade.But I'm digressing. This is the third \"Jaws\" movie and it's fascinating for me to watch these films in chronological order if only because of how massively they declined with each installment. At first, I thought this didn't have any connections to the previous films, but I was wrong. The main characters are the Brody brothers, the sons of the main lead from the other films. It's still a loose connection. I literally fell asleep watching this movie as it was so boring. Okay, that was probably only because I stayed up for New Year's Eve and got little sleep, but still it was boring. Even for a 98 minute film, it seemed too long. Everything was padded.The worst thing was of course how bad the special effects were. I mean, I even tried to use some old 3-D glasses I had around and they didn't work. Everything is horribly stilted here. I have never seen any film that has images that so blatantly try to just stick out to the audience. The coloring effects are terrible. I can blatantly see an error with the submarine as part of it visibly vanishes through a bad special effect. The shark models look terrible too. It is literally the worst use of 3-D I have ever seen in any film. I couldn't find Ebert's review of it, but it might have had a profound effect on him. Skip this. *1/2",

            "review_title": "Just okay, no matter how many dimensions you see it in",
            "content": "Even aside from the timely numerical designation of this sequel, the Jaws franchise seems like a natural for the realm of 3-D. The requisite underwater terrain alone is a perfect medium for textured dimensional rendering, and the idea of a terrifying, relentless killing machine swimming off-screen into audiences' laps is inherently awesome in and of itself. Sadly, this uneven offering never takes full advantage of its technology or its subject matter, and while it's nowhere near as bad as the truly abysmal Jaws: The Revenge (few things are), it's also nowhere near as good as the flawless original or the excellent and unfairly dismissed follow-up.Even without its potentially interesting visual ploy, Jaws 3-D has all of the ingredients to be a great sequel on paper: a stellar cast, a fresh concept, and, of course, a toothy behemoth that had already generated some of the scariest moments in screen history. These assets are ultimately squandered however. The seasoned ensemble is given very little to do, so the character studies at the heart of Jaws and Jaws 2 are bypassed entirely. The Sea World setting is woefully underused, and instead of giving our beast a novel killing ground, the park mostly functions as merely another mass of water for the action to unfold in. Worse, the shark itself isn't ever used in a suspenseful fashion, and the handful of deaths attributed to the monster are blatantly telegraphed and largely ineffective.Like many 3-D films that are stripped of their visual device for the home market, this one contains multiple scenes that may have been fun to behold on theater screens, but become utterly silly here. Floating fish heads and severed limbs bobbing with the tide might have provided cheap thrills for the opening weekend audience, but in a flat DVD representation, they simply function as camera shots that linger for far too long.The shark effects range from serviceable to downright awful, and since footage of actual sharks is utilized rather extensively, the titular titan more clearly resembles a synthetic puppet when we're seeing it at work. A couple of scenes of the creature slamming into gates and boats seem to have been created by using a plastic mock-up instead the sophisticated robotic construct that populated the first two Jaws outings, and since little effort is made to sell these moments, you can actually see the rubber shark bounce off its targets upon collision. When these flashes are integrated alongside the graceful maneuvering of real great whites, there is little symmetry between the two versions and the complete suspension of disbelief required to make a scenario like this pay off is rarely achieved.Apart from its obviousness as a prop, the shark in Jaws 3-D just isn't all that frightening because the meager body count doesn't allow it to prove itself as an insatiable murder machine. A couple of random victims are thrown in early on, but when the shark finally makes its way into the water park, where a virtual sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of flailing legs awaits, every single person the shark pursues easily escapes its titular Jaws. Only one of the major characters gets bit during this extended sequence, and she gets away with little more than a few scratches on her leg.There are a few solid jump scares peppered throughout the film, but while the tension seems to be mounting every step of the way, the movie invariably pulls back before anything all that spectacular or horrifying occurs. Even the promising climax goes flaccid when the absolute dumbest false 3-D moment occurs, and any menace our finned antagonist has generated along the way is readily diffused by a protracted shot of her slowly floating toward the camera and breaking through a plainly animated sheet of glass. The way the shark is dispatched is particularly hard to swallow (this is actually a pretty good pun if you've seen the film), and yet another silly extended \"in your face\" moment caps off a tremendously underwhelming resolution.Savvy collectors will easily be able to track down readily available bootleg DVDs that retain the original 3-D presentation, but even the cleanest transfer available on the secondary market is still high-generation and extremely murky, a state which naturally strips away the potency of the visual effects. Watching my copy gave me a headache, and I had to stop about every thirty minutes or so to take off the glasses and give my eyes a rest. I eventually made it through, but when I did, all I discovered was that Jaws 3-D isn't much more impressive in its original form. The obsessive collector in me knows that if this offering ever gets a proper Blu-Ray release I will have to add it to my collection and give the film at least one more go, but the realist in me is guessing that even digitized 3-D effects won't make up for the numerous other weaknesses on hand here.There are a few effective moments here that will hold the attention of admirers of the series, but the film as a whole is a missed opportunity that can only be rightfully recommended to the most forgiving killer fish fans. An even better recommendation for those who have digested every frame of the unmatchable original and simply must have more is to skip this one entirely and give Jaws 2 another look instead.",

            "content": "3D films have something of a dubious reputation for being bereft of creative energy or merit. How long they have had this reputation for, I do not know. If they did not have such a reputation before 1983, they certainly earned it then. After Friday The 13th Part 3, all the 3D film needed was another crapfest to give it a reputation as being a cover for a bad story or script. They got it in the form of Jaws 3-D, which not only ranks as one of the worst films I have seen to date, it also ranks as one of the worst 3D films I can remember. And I include 3D shorts from theme parks in that list.As with all films that have 3D photography, the big make-or-break point is the 3D effects. Where Friday The 13th Part 3 did at least a reasonable job with this effect, Jaws 3-D is a spectacular crapfest with its effects, too. Given that both films were shot using the same process, ArriVision 3D, the blame for this lies solely with the director. Underwater shots are hideous in appearance, with enough grain and diminished focus to leave the audience wondering what in the blazes is going on. A lack of detail in dark spots of the picture is often characteristic of films that were shot in the early 1980s and previous, but many of the underwater shots show no effort at all to alleviate this problem. Those who have seen Blade Runner will know this is not impossible. In fact, a few stage lights in the right places could have worked miracles during the underwater/nighttime shots.The acting is thoroughly wooden, but I cannot help blaming the director for this, too. Given that the cast includes such B-list dependables as Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr., one would at least expect to be able to coax a halfway decent performance out of them. Especially considering that the things they are reacting to existed right on the set with them. Sadly, Quaid looks like he is ready to ask if he is meant to be scared yet, and Gossett Jr. looks like he's ingested too many painkillers. Mind you, these are the best performances that the film has to offer. You will be hard pressed to name two other actors from the film or the characters they portrayed.To the film's credit, there are no ridiculous scenes where the shark roars or explodes for no readily apparent reason. While the photography does much to make the equivalent scenes in Jaws 3-D nonsensical, they do make sense if you pay attention. Unfortunately, the ridiculous 3D effects will also leave you chuckling. The moment when the shark explodes, and its teeth come flying at the screen, is a priceless moment of unintentional comedy.This is where it all comes crashing down, unfortunately. The original Jaws was made on a very tight budget, and its director realised that he could not rely on effects to carry the day. He therefore decided to focus upon the human element, and filled his cast with the best cheap talent he could get his hands upon. Whether it was his direction or their ability, the performances manage to keep the viewer focused upon something other than the cheapness of the effects. Although you might forget the name of the characters, you won't forget the men who played them in a real hurry. Which is exactly the problem here. As in Alien 3, the characters are unmemorable because they don't have anything remotely approaching a second dimension.I gave Jaws 3-D a one out of ten. As a serious horror or drama, it sucks dead bunnies through a straw. As a comedy, it works better than the Marx Brothers at times. Jaws: The Revenge was so bad it was incredible. Jaws 3-D was so bad that it is legendary.",

            "content": "Yet another movie about a giant shark wreaking havoc. This time around it takes place at Sea World, and the main characters are the sons of the previous film's hero, Martin Brody. After several people are killed by a shark, the baby is accidentally captured, being mistaken for the culprit. Things take an exciting turn, when the culprit shark arrives to find it's baby and have a bite to eat. It's actually amazing that anybody in their right mind would be willing to take a risk making another Jaws movie, but I'm sure the 3-D effects helped it out a little. I'll admit that the cinematography was pretty nice in some spots, and the music could be pretty exciting, but it isn't as scary or as suspenseful as the incredible previous films. The acting in this movie is abysmal with a few exceptions, Dennis Quaid was okay as the hero, Louis Gossett Jr. helped to keep the movie afloat, no pun intended. And Lea Thompson wasn't all that bad either, she's mostly there for eye candy but whatever. The other actors were pretty lame, including the pompous Australian character who becomes dinner for the shark. The special effects can't even save the movie though, they are seriously some of the worst I have ever seen. There are several cheesy shots that were obviously for the three dimensional magic that simply doesn't exist without the glasses and the various super imposed images are extremely laughable, at one point you can actually see part of the little submarine get eaten up by the blue screen. The most gruesome scene in the movie is when despite his dull death scene, the shark's first victim's corpse floats in front of a glass tunnel and scaring everyone to death. It was funny when the corpse is right against the glass wall, right in front of a teenage girl, who is not only screaming in utter terror, but is pressed against the glass. I laughed so hard during this insanely goofy scene. On the other hand, it was gross seeing the corpse laid out on a table completely skinless from the neck down, and crabs crawling out of his mouth, pretty cool. I'm sure it must have been somewhat entertaining to see this movie in it's original cheesy 3-D glory, it's pretty horrible without it.The scene where the shark busts through glass and and floods a control room is unforgettable. The super imposed shark is motionlessly floating toward the camera, and there are various shots of the characters inside in slow motion. I watched this with my mom and she thought something was wrong with the video, she didn't realize it was for dramatic effect until halfway through the scene. When the shark busts through the glass, some glass shatters and falls, the shark is still floating there completely still. This can be excused thanks to the shark's death scene, which is still tainted by effects that would only be slightly cool in 3-D. Bottom line, this is mediocre movie and can only be fun because it's so awful that it's funny. The better parts of the movie, is the fast paced second half, Dennis Quaid, Louis Gossett Jr. and seeing Lea Thompson in a swimsuit, which was probably the saving grace of the movie. I don't really recommend this movie, but if you're just that curious to see how low the series was falling then knock yourself out. The first and original movie was a masterpiece that never needed a sequel, the second one was still pretty good, this one bites and bears no resemblance to anything the previous ones offered, but then there's a fourth one.",

Carl Gottlieb who wrote the previous Jaws movies came back, to write the screenplay but helped with the writer Richard Matheson. In the making of the movie the filmmakers decided to release the third Jaws in 3D, as there were other horror movies like Friday the 13th Part III which also used the 3D technique. It is a good way to see a movie with a technique, which would make the story immersive to feel being inside of it. After an exhausting work on the production, in 1983 came out Jaws 3-D with Dennis Quaid. The movie's plot: the sons of chief police Martin Brody, Mike and Sean who are grown up now. They work at the theme park SeaWorld, where a great white shark gets trapped inside of it. But then the main characters would realize, the mother of the great white shark is inside of the theme park as well. Jaws 3-D could be an interesting movie as there have been some changes, without using any actors or actresses of the previous Jaws movies. Instead the movie completely failed to surprise the audience and the critics, as it just bored to be a totally uninteresting story. Especially for the use of the cliches in the course of the movie, which can easily distract the audience to not let them focus on the story. The effects of 3D in the movie makes hilarious and annoying as most of the scenes, were focused on the stuffs which would be thrown to the audience's eyes in an inappropriate way. The actors tried to act as good as possible their performances, but it wouldn't change anything to have a second thought about the movie. Jaws 3-D is one of the worst movies of all time.",

            "content": "I grew up watching all the Jaws films from young & i like the whole franchise of course the first film is the best & the all time classic of the lot but each is good fun in their own way & i like the whole franchise but 1 & 2 are obviously the best.This is easy going colourful summertime fun with cheesy bits but all in true 80's fashion so yes this movie has alot of charm & mainly it's very entertaining!!!Lead star Dennis Quaid is a real 80's actor who i saw in Enemy Mine & Innerspace on video growing up & he's decent here as Cheif Brody's now grown-up son Michael.Another good 80's actor Louis Gossett Jr (he also starred with Dennis Quaid again in the Awesome sci-fi thriller Enemy Mine) & posh British actor Simon MacCorkindale as professional shark hunter Philip Fitzroyce, a character i actually liked best in this ensemble cast. Lea Thompson (Back to the Future) is another 80's actor that stars & Bess Armstrong who gives the films best performance as Kathryn, Michael's girlfriend that is also a dolphin trainer & marine biologist. Yes, Kathryn Morgan is the strongest character in the movie with her smarts (knowledge) & weariness of how serious the situation is. The weakest actor is John Putch as younger brother Sean Brody, he's pretty corny. I really liked Fitzroyce's right-hand man Jack Tate played by P. H Moriarty, another British fellow & good character. You get the feeling there's a lot of interesting adventurous history with those two missionaries.I love lots of films that seem to be hated by everyone so that doesn't bother me as in life you like what you like so who cares? & i reCally like the adventure Thriller Jaws 3 & another bonus is we wouldn't have deep blue sea (1999) without Jaws 3 as there's so many similar bits & shots it's like Deep Blue Sea is a distant cousin sequel or exists in the same universe their both too similar.Jaws 3 is just so much fun well it's the most B-movie of the franchise but the most fun of the franchise & full of summertime adventure with the best music of the franchise & a real sense of wonder & adventure plus it also boasts the most sinister & most terrifying kill from the massive shark in the whole franchise yes that's right the disturbing death of the British Shark hunter when he's in it's massive jaws & he's still alive but the shark just keeps him there crushing him but not chewing him it's as if this shark is pure evil & is torturing this guy & the camera view from inside it's jaws & seeing the light outside it's mouth & he's reaching out to it is truly terrifying so yeah there's alot to like in Jaws 3 & it's probably my fave after the classic original.The under water cinematography is stunning in Jaws 3.Also Jaws 3 fits in nicely with the slasher boom of that time as Jaws 3 often looks & feels like a teen slasher as the big evil shark is stalking it's victims within the Sea World amusement park & picking them off one by one is brutal ways it's got that slasher formula in a way & it works perfectly.I've always loved Jaws 3 & just like I've always loved Halloween 3:season of the witch (1982) another cult classic sequel in another famous franchise & it was hated on for years but finally it's been seen as a great stand alone film & maybe Jaws 3 will receive that fan base one day? Anyway i love it.I love the sea life centre adventure park setting & the characters are all good especially a young Dennis Quaid & the always cool Louis Gossett Jr so the cast is nice & the movie has a real exciting sense of fun & Horror with some memorable classic moments such as the shark attacking the under water dome attraction with everyone running & screaming it's real B-movie Horror fun.I know it's not as good & well made as Jaws 2 but there's a charm to Jaws 3 that i genuinely enjoy & like i said the Amusement park setting is great & the music score is Fantastic again & the silly fake ropey \"3D\" fx just add to the pure 80's fun of it & it only adds to it's dated charm!!!!Jaws 3 to me is the most fun of the franchise it's not the best made or best acted but the most fun & like i said a nice new setting is appreciated.I don't understand all the hate for this movie? Of course it's not Spielberg again but it's a fun follow up in the series & i have fond memories of watching this & always will love it & yes that's probably my Nostalgia talking but hey all these films was apart of my childhood growing up as we all know Jaws was a phenomenon & an iconic bit of pop culture so these movies was always around on t.v & in video stores so yeah i love the whole franchise but Spielbergs 1975 original is the masterpiece but the others are all great sequels & 3 is most fun.A pure fun Summer monster movie & one that's ridiculously entertaining & rewatchable & a colourful exciting summertime romp.My personal favourite after the classic original & i know it's not as well made as even Jaws 2 but part 3 like I've said is so much fun & a perfect summertime movie.Jaws 3 is a Nostalgia filled pure 80's fun fest.",

Though I myself didn't think this film was great, it wasn't too bad!In this 3rd instalment Jaws attacks a water park, Sea World Orlando is terrorised by Jaws & the people in the park become victims to the veracious beast from the first 2 films! It is also one of the films of the 1980's to be in 3D, crap 3D before it became good! But OK for their first attempt being honest.The kills in this film were lacking, though a lot of scenes had some suspenseful moments in them the kills in this film were lacking & too much pointless story telling went into this film. About 40 minutes of this film was about this that but shark attacks & kills which the first 2 films had (Especially Jaws 2). But even then in this day & age I feel the Jaws films as a whole could do with some beefing up & be like Shark Night 3D or Piranha 3D.The title of the film suggests parody in on itself! With the cheesy poster, tag-line & the 3D Lettering which takes the cake! But it wasn't a terrible film! It just lacked a few things here & there. The ending was pretty good not as good as Jaws 2's ending but pretty good considering how crap the 3D effects were back then but it was decent enough!Overall, it was an OK film. Not the best & not as good as the first 2 (Jaws 2). But an alright film. 5/10",

Sea world has just opened up an underwater walk through so people can view marine life, and the new attraction is a baby Great White Shark. Unfortunately, the shark's mommy comes looking for it and wreaks all kinds of havoc in the process. Now it's up to Michael to stop the shark. With astoundingly bad special effects and acting, Jaws 3 makes the second film look like Ben Hur.Even what remains of John Williams' score couldn't make this movie the least bit chilling. The makers of this film decided to switch it up from the first one and show the shark any chance they get. Unfortunately, the special effects are so bad in this movie that the shark looks like a cartoon among reality. The tail doesn't even move as it swims through the water. They even make the shark roar like a lion, even though that's impossible. The plot of this movie is too simple. Mommy shark looks for baby shark. Kills people. Michael Brody must stop it. Anything beyond that is useless filler. The second film was understandable because it took place in the same area where it would be more likely to see another shark. Now we're at Sea World where Michael Brody works, and another killer shark shows up! Michael's gotta think there's a curse on him. When he was 12, the first shark swam right by him after killing somebody. When he was 16, he was attacked on a sailboat by another shark. Now he's grown up working at Sea World and another one attacks him! That's a 1 in a billion chance, but whatever.Dennis Quaid plays the role of Michael Brody to the best of his ability at the time, but it's not that good. Louis Gosset Jr. is okay, but he was always kind of a B actor. All of the other actors in this movie aren't worthy of being called actors.Overall, Jaws 3 completely ruins the impact the first film had, and is a waste of everyone's time.3/10",

Before we get into it, here are my ratings:Story - 1.25\nDirection - 0.75\nPace - 0.50\nActing - 1.25\nEnjoyment - 1.00TOTAL - 4.75What happens when you take the shark out of Amityville? The big fish flounders.Though, in all fairness, I cannot put the fault at the writers' feet. Both Gotlieb and Matheson, the legend, have solid writing backgrounds. Gotlieb even wrote for the original and better Jaws and Jaws 2. The story is not the worst I've seen, and it expands on the original films. I liked the concept of moving away from Amityville Island, though a couple of the principal characters come from the island. Six degrees of separation and all that.So, where does the blame belong? The director, the special effects, and the person who decided to make it a 3-D movie. Joe Alves does his best to embrace the 3-D but falls woefully short. So not only do we get severed fish heads spinning towards us, but we have, fallen reeds and jumping frogs. As for the special effects, to say this shark was awful would be an understatement. The animatronics are nowhere on par with the original great white. The only parts that move, and badly, are its jaws, the skin around the mouth, and the slow left and right swish of its tail fin. And, the captured baby shark is physically manhandled to create his movement. That said, there is one gruesome and notable effect - the dead workman. He is one nasty looking corpse. Even this bright flash in the dark and the talented cast cannot save the film.Thanks to the shoddy special effects, the film's flow takes on a lethargic pace that damages the movie beyond hope of complete enjoyment. The injury gets worse when you factor in the 2-D 3-D shots. The old 80s 3-D process looks flat and unreal when converted into 2-D.The only reason I would recommend this flick would be if you are looking to watch the entire series. Though, I'd suggest missing Jaws 3-D, unless you have nothing better to watch, or do.Feel free to check out my Absolute Horror and Monstrous lists to see where I have ranked Jaws 3-D.Take Care & Stay Well.",

            "content": "There is absolutely nothing that this movie has anything to redeem itself, and that is just really sad. So after we got the first two \"Jaws\" movies, we got to have another one as this franchise keeps milking itself and this time it has gone to a third dimension. Yes, this movie was entirely shot in 3D during the 80s, and I hate to tell you this, I have never saw this movie as it was originally shot. I only saw this in 2D only, and I don't think that Universal Studios wouldn't bother to reissue this movie on Blu Ray with the 3D version. Also, I don't know how good the 3D version is, and I really don't know if it makes the movie a little better. So, what do I know about? So speaking of 3D, the movie is about another great white shark attacking more people, but this time it is attacking at a theme park known as Sea World (I'll admit that I actually like having a shark attacking at Sea World, but that is not saying much). Also, we have Martin Brody's son working at Sea World as he tries to protect the tourist from getting attack by a shark. So, that is what the plot of the third movie is, and I think its really lame. The characters aren't really that interesting, and nothing much to their personalities. However, I do like some of the actors in this movie like Dennis Quad, Bess Armstrong and Lea Thompson but their performances don't save the movie. I really don't care much of the rest of the cast, and really don't have much comment of their acting. Heck, really don't care for the music at all. Joe Alves, who was the production designer of the first two \"Jaws\" movies was chosen to direct this movie, and I really don't think he is really that capable on making a good \"Jaws\" movie. Again, about the 3D, I don't know if that version is better than 2D, but I do say that the 3D effects are very cheesy looking. The shark itself looks fine as it was all done practical, but the real life footage is hardly used in this movie because of the use of 3D. Even that one part, where the shark comes to break the glass slowly which I find it laughable. The movie does have some laughable moments like some tourist push a girl to the glass, where there is a dead man outside underwater. Also, the British guy's buddy yelling so loud by how much he has been overreacting. One scene in the movie, where you have two thugs that are trying to steal coral, which I think it should have been cut out because its adds absolutely nothing to the movie. Very pointless, if you think about it. I don't have much comment about the pacing, but it is 99 minutes and really can't comment if this movie bores me or not. So I'll let you be the judge of that on your own views of the movie, but if you enjoy it for its silliness that is fine. To me, there is nothing much to recommend that this movie is so bad its good, so I say that its just bad. \"Jaws 3-D\" is lame and silly, and I personally give it a 2 out of 10.",

Well, seeing as how this film is the third in a series all about the same exact thing, I'm surprised anyone decided to OK this one at all. Anyhow, a mere 8 years after the original \"Jaws\" scared the living you-know-what out of moviegoers, this bore fest was tossed in to theaters to milk the series of a few more bucks. The plot is exactly the same, only it takes place at Sea World, so we'll skip it. Not one of the cast members from the first two films showed up, but this was scripted by Carl Gottlieb, (original Jaws Screenwriter) ,and, for some peculiar reason, Richard Matheson. Dennis Quaid plays Michael Brody, the kid from the other movies (people age faster in sequel-land, I guess), and he is no substitute for Roy Scheider. Really, he's dweeby, unimposing, and an all around \"nice guy\". The coolest stunt he does in the film is crash a golf cart. None of the other characters really left much of an impression on me either.The mechanical shark is as bad as in the first two films, but this time the film makers were dumb enough to show it all the time, showing just how fakey it is. At one point, it even crashes through the control room at Sea World, kind of like the Airplane in 1980's \"Airplane\", only even funnier. There's a lot of showing the shark swimming around, but not much action, making it very tedious and boring. I only gave it 2 instead of one star because the make up effects on the mutilated dead guy they fish out of the tank, as well as a few of the \"3-D\" effects looked pretty cool. Other than that, there's no reason to recommend this one. Stick with the classics. This ain't one of 'em.",

In theatres it was presented in glorious 3-D, but not for home video, nor is it shown in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio, which sort of takes the fun out of this movie. But it still has its assets. Besides having a big cast, I can easily say that the mechanical shark in this installment is the best yet! First off, I liked how the eyes of this shark realistically rolled back white whenever it attacked its prey, just as real sharks' do. A very nice touch.I also noticed that the shark in this movie had a lot more attention paid to the working mechanics of its jaws. For instance, when a shark opens its mouth, its gums lower to the point that they look like they're going to fall right out of its mouth. You'd think something so noticeable would've been incorperated into the design of the mechanical shark in the the first Jaws movie. But it wasn't until Jaws 3 when that effect finally came into play. It was the first and only mechanical shark in the series that did that. It was also the only shark in the series that never stuck its head out of the water for more than a couple of seconds, which was more realistic than having a shark throw itself onto a boat, and stay there until someone slides into its mouth.Lastly, the shark's skin seems to have been perfected. It wasn't rubbery like the sharks in the first and second movie, and wasn't as rough as sandpaper like the one in the fourth Jaws. Its skin actually looked fleshy! Apart from the shark's super-slow speed, and the several instinces where we were obviously meant to see it in 3-D, this shark looked more real than all the other sharks in the series put together! The one thing that I couldn't get past with the shark in this movie was its size. Though it's true that all the sharks in the Jaws series were guilty of being overly large, 35 feet is ridiculous! And what better way to see this big female shark demonstrate her freakish size than by scooping a full grown man completely into her mouth, where he's repeatedly squeezed between her massive tongue and the roof of her mouth until he explodes! Though it was interesting to watch, and maybe even a little funny, it was clearly impossible.All in all, this movie just served to be campy fun, and will appeal to you if you enjoy movies like: Anaconda, Lake Placid, Piranha, and Deep Blue Sea. However, if you're hoping for a movie that recaptures the fear of the original Jaws, than don't look any further than Jaws 2..........",

            "content": "The brilliance of Steven Spielberg's 1975 film \"Jaws\" was that it took the premise for what was essentially a B-grade monster movie and pumped it up with so much thrills and so much escapist joy (and added some very interesting characters) that it excelled to a first-class work of art. \"Jaws 2\" was a production whose rushed schedule showed clearly in every frame, but at least it made a noble effort to be good and still capture not only the same thrills, but the same charm as the original. So it wasn't dismal when it failed. However, with the revival of the wildly over-hyped and unnecessary 3D format of movies came the third installment, \"Jaws III\" also known as \"Jaws: 3D.\" A little time has passed since the second movie. Martin Brody's (Roy Scheider from the first two movies) sons have grown up and one of them (a young Dennis Quaid) is a maintenance manager at Sea World. During his brother's (John Putch) visit, a great white shark busts through the underwater gates and begins to snack on people who venture into the park's waters. Eventually, the shark is captured, which leads to a jaw-dropping discovery: the shark is a baby. So ignoring the fact that in reality sharks do *not* care for their offspring, the cardboard cut-out characters declare that its 35-foot-long mother must also be on the loose on opening day, of all times.Gone are the thrills and gone are the great characters. Looking back on the original \"Jaws\" and having the chance to see it in a theater for the first time (and meeting its screenwriter, the knowledgeable Carl Gottlieb) I am only further reminded of how strongly that movie succeeded because of three sharply-written, characteristic-packed characters who we believe in as human beings. They were essentially cutouts (a police chief, a mad hunter, a biologist) expanded into personalities we could relate to, people we liked, so that we rooted for the humans and condemned the sharks. Well, the characters here are more cutouts, but they remain so. Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong do what they can, but they have nothing to expand their characters upon. Their motives and scenarios are flat, their passion nonexistent. The same applies for the supporting cast, with nobody standing out.For the record, I have only seen the two-dimensional format of this picture. Reportedly the movie is no longer available for 3D viewing because it was so cheaply done and looking at the film, I can see why. Because even if the optical hocus pocus were handled well, it would not excuse the incredibly cheap visual effects. Oftentimes when the shark attacks, it uses the same gimmick. First of all, the tracking point-of-view shot which was so terrifying in the original movie and so redundant in the sequels. The camera zooms in on the victim, in a close-up so extreme that we can hardly see anything, the screen goes red, and then out of plume of over-lit blood we see a digital image meant to be a severed head or leg float toward the screen. If it jumped out at you, it would only increase the stultifying reality of how fake it is. Sometimes the movie even throws in cheap gimmicks for a 3D shot for no reason at all, such as a ludicrous shot where the camera zooms in upon a masthead-like sculpture protruding over the entrance to an exhibit. Does the object have any plot relevance or does it even look particularly good? No. So why include this track-in shot? So the filmmakers could make a thing stand out for no particular reason.There are a great many horrid effects shots in the movie. Bad underwater sculpture and set design, including a submersible that was all too obviously a toy tricked into the shot. Effects like this had been done better twenty years before. As for the shark, the filmmakers make the dumb decision of using live shark footage for most of the scenes. As with the second movie, we see a lot of the shark this time around and by showing so much live shark footage and so few animatronics (which aren't too good this time around) the comparison is only more jarring. Sometimes the shark is also a digital effect, including an infamous shot where it rams through an aquarium glass, also not-so-convincing. And then there is a cheap rubber model used for the baby shark, which looks like something taken out of a TV movie.Actually, the whole movie seems like something taken out of a TV movie. It was directed by Joe Alves, the production designer for the previous two movies and unfortunately his directing talents are far below his ability to create models, animatronics, and sets. With many logical errors (such as a shark out-swimming a motorboat), lackluster character development, horrid special effects, and a distinct lack of joy, \"Jaws III\" results in being a very forgettable production. I guess that's the best I can say about it. That although it bored me as I watched it, I found no difficulty in forgetting the experience the following morning.",

He would literally write the scenes that were going to be filmed the next day on his typewriter the night before.  He has talent. But how on earth could he put his name after this piece of garbage.  This is a cheap attempt to capitalize on the good name that was Jaws.  The first changed cinema and it changed people's lives.  The second was very scary and continued a good story.  The last was laughable and this one is close behind.  I'm not even going any further with this because just trust me and every other viewer when we say that it is a terrible film.  Really really bad.Not a bad cast though.  Gossett Jr. Quaid and Lea Thompson.  Too bad they all didn't get eaten.",

            "review_title": "Pre-cursor to Jurassic Park?",
            "content": "This is one seriously bad film, but on reflection maybe it gave author Michael Crichton some ideas for his novel Jurassic Park, which later became the Stephen Spielberg movie of the same name. Spielberg of course directed the original classic Jaws film, of which this is the second sequel. A great white shark causes chaos in a marine theme park as against the cloned dinosaurs escaping and causing chaos at a pre-historic theme park. Unfortunately the production standards of this film aren't even a pale imitation of the original, 3D effects notwithstanding. For the record, I didn't see this in 3D.Putting aside the campy performances, cheesy special effects, unconvincing acting and downright awful dialogue, Jaws 3D just has a ridiculous storyline. It just defies belief that a supposedly 35 foot ( it never looks anywhere near that big in the film) white shark could enter an artificial enclosed marine park lake ... and then hide out! But that's what we're expected to swallow, hook, line and ... you know the rest. And then the management decisions to deal with the issue are of course predictably inept.Hard to believe too that Louis Cameron Gossett Jr. went from his Oscar winning turn in An Officer and a Gentleman to this, where he was nominated very appropriately I think, for a Razzie award. We do get to see a young Dennis Quaid in just about his first inauspicious lead role, before he hit the big time proper in his next film The Right Stuff.I may be harsh not looking at the film in 3D, but the special effects look terribly fake, even taking into account, it was released in 1983. The suspense/action quota is laughable. Because the film was given an American PG 13 rating, you don't ever really see anyone getting eaten. You just see clouds of red in the water, close-ups of a mouthful of teeth and some hilarious chomping sounds. Stuff like this gives credence to the stories of Jaws 3 originally being envisaged as a spoof.I'm amazed this film was a commercial success giving rise to another equally vacuous sequel. People must have loved putting on those funny glasses.",

Example: Dennis Quaid is decent, and for the most part the other actors aren't too horrible, the plot is great (shark in sea world!!), and the set prices are creepy enough. But... The 3D is just ridiculously horrid in a few parts. I know some of them really just need the 3D treatment, but a few cuts were just unforgivable.And... 2/3ds of the camera-work look like TV movie/digital camera type Quality, which doesn't look at all as good as the great film quality of one and two. In both versions I've seen everything is blurry for a film in theaters (I've heard that last part is due to universal never releasing a correctly made non-3D version of the film)So those two combined really seem to screw up this film a little bit. Too bad, because this fun-but-not-great movie could have been much better. Jaws 3D might just get better rating if it was revised in HD with some of the 3D cuts removed (Or a 3D version- Yes!). Jaws 3D is also quite different in both tone and style from the other films. Both Jaws 1 and 2 seem to focus on being trapped on the open sea, Jaws 3D is more claustrophobic-based. And the style is also very different from 2 and 1, One is very thriller styled, whereas two is more showy. Surprisingly this film is not as showy as Jaws 2. It's style is just strait horror. And Jaws: TR- It's tone and style are pretty much \"Watching jaws 2 while you're high\" In all I thought it was an okay film, but a mixed bag. (By the way I would give this a 6-7 if I could see the true 3D version of the film.",

            "content": "Actually, of course, this movie set up what I probably think an offspring of it not related to Jaws...\"Deep Blue Sea.\" \"Deep Blue Sea\" of course focuses on several ocean stowaways on a research lagoon where three captured sharks eventually go awry and end up as man-eating killers almost in the style of all of the Jaws movies. \"Jaws III\" is almost like that.It was of course the original Jaws where those who loved Jaws had seen how the movie ended....with a shark being blown up as a bullet pierces a compressed-air scuba canister thanks to Chief Brody's hail of bullets from a rifle from an Orca boat that was about to be completely sunk into nothing.Jaws III has a slight give-away in the middle of the movie where a visiting character with a UK accent shows how a rogue shark could be killed....by a \"nose bomb\". Definitely this refers to how the original \"Jaws\" ended...with an explosion. I found out that this explosive device has a power nearly similar to an explosive force as a classic depth charge. Louis Gossett Jr. tells that guy never to attempt to set off such explosives in the lagoon that was going to be terrorized by a baby rogue shark (a 13-footer) which dies in captivity in the lagoon, hence infuriating the rogue shark's mother that enters the lagoon through a faulty gate; this shark, a 28- to 32-footer (definitely a \"Great White\" class), chases the path where the already-dead shark went inside the lagoon and terrorizes the lagoon for another meal and some more victims.Louis Gossett Jr. counters that these shark-killing explosives could destroy the acrylic material in the lagoon and destroy the lagoon itself. But of course, when the shark hits the windows of the main control room of the lagoon, flooding it, using the \"nose bomb\" was a last resort because before the last shark was bloodied to death by the explosion, it already ate up one of the main control employees of the lagoon.I had seen that one of the other actors was a marine biologist who had tried to care for the shark that was killed in captivity. She also had the difficult task to figure out one of the shark victims (the \"mother shark\") who was floating lifelessly underwater in the lagoon...and had to identify it in the makeshift morgue as the dead body was revealed...in full view...with shark cut marks and, cut-off skin. I can remember the famous line she said...\"It was a shark! It was a shark...with a bite radius of about...a yard across!\"",

If the sharks could write a movie about the people that hunted them, it would be this one.There are two kinds of people in this film: pompous asses and dumb hicks. And those that fall in-between tend to have the bad qualities of both.  But there are two scenes that keep this one just THIS FAR out of the gutter.SCENE ONE: I'm sure you know about the scene where the tour group is walking through the underwater tube and a little girl tells her Daddy, \"Daddy, look at the big fish!\"  Daddy looks up, there's the shark.  \"HOLY (EXPLETIVE),\" Daddy yells, the whole group starts running.Love it.SCENE TWO: Bess Armstrong and Dennis Quaid are informed that one of the victims of the shark has been discovered.  They go to see him; Dennis checks him out first.  The victim is in a pretty bad state of decay, judging from the stripped flesh and worms crawling over the carcass (aren't they supposed to clean the corpses off once they've been found, just for description purposes?). Dennis retches, runs off, vomits in a corner.  Bess steps up, surveys the body, solemnly whispers \"Oh, my God.\"  No retching.  Nothing.Guess which one's seen more \"Friday the 13th\" movies?Bottom line: you want a good laugh?  See \"Jaws 3D\" right now.  No matter the cost, the toll on your body, your family, your life.

These flaws are enough to distract you from other, more conventional flaws. For one thing, the story is bland, and I mean bland. Jaws gets trapped in Sea World in Orlando, Florida. And before I go any further I just have to dwell on how dumb that marketing trick was. Is that really the coverage you want? On top of that, the characters are all stock. Almost none of them have any personality at all. There's no reason to care about any of these people. The bottom line is that Jaws 3-D is just a mix of awful special effects with a really lazy, uninteresting script thrown in as filler.

The Production design specifically was entertaining. It helped that they showed a model of the undersea kingdom in the beginning to fill the gaps left by the crumbing special effects. But since almost the entire movie takes place inside the park, the filmmakers do a good job of making you feel like you are at an actual Sea World. Dennis Quaid demonstrates (for however brief) that he can fill a man of action role well. Bess Armstrong is hopelessly sincere even while spouting out ridiculous lines. Also the underwater photography is clearer and more fleshed out than is the norm.So if you are looking for a coherent, entertaining film - search elsewhere.

But in the tradition of a lot of Hollywood sequels, this third big fish entry is even more ludicrous than the second, and of course nowhere near as believably frightening as the first.Dennis Quaid stars as Mike Brody, who is now employed at Florida's Undersea Kingdom.  His younger brother Sean (John Putch) has the same problems with hydrophobia that their father once had, a fear that is amply justified when he goes to visit Quaid in Florida, and a shark enters the park's submarine tubes, killing three employees before being anaesthetized by Quaid and the park's chief itchycologist (Bess Armstrong).  What neither they nor the park's manager (Louis Gossett Jr.) know is that its mother is coming for its young one.  The result is the expected panic and a shark destruction scene that tops the one in JAWS 2 by leaps and bounds for its sheer ludicrousness.Even though it was originally shown in 3-D, JAWS 3 still isn't very good. Sure, it has Quaid, Armstrong, Gossett, and even an early appearance by Lea Thompson.  But all of that goes for naught because of the stiff direction of Joe Alves (the production designer on the first two films, and associate producer on JAWS 2) and the unusually lame script by Richard Matheson (of DUEL and \"Twilight Zone\" fame) and Carl Gottlieb (who co-wrote the first two movies).  Many of the effects are pretty good, and the acting is fair. Otherwise, however, JAWS 3 is a watchable film and nothing more than that.",

Later, the new JAWS movie was put out only to convince folks that it wasn't the same thing again. The result probably was beyond disappointment.Here's what I believe happened to JAWS 3. Alan Landsburg Productions actually created a killer shark movie not relating to the JAWS theme. Universal had a past history of suing film studios in releasing rip-offs similar to their patented work. Letting the giant movie studio release ALP's production was obviously the safest bet in avoiding a lawsuit. A few people may have remembered a poverty row studio called Film Ventures International, who released a movie in '82 called GREAT WHITE for about a single weekend, only to have banned future showings as a result of a court order involving plagiarism.My advice to movie buffs is to remain committed to the original JAWS film released in 1975.

            "content": "\"Jaws 3-D\" (1983), it appears that the film makers haven't learned their lesson yet. Just when you thought these movies couldn't get any worse, they vomit this waste of cinema in our faces! Wow, as if two mediocre films weren't enough. I'm still asking myself: \"why did I waste my life watching this \"movie\"? This \"film\" is so bad, that it's an embarrassment. \"Jaws 3-D\" has a redundant and cliched story, the acting is all over the place, most of the special effects are abysmal, and the soundtrack is a joke! The plot is, a great white shark accidentally gets itself trapped in a SeaWorld theme park, and it's up to Brody's children to save everyone. I will give the story some credit (SOME!) They were on the right track by placing the shark in a singular location setting, rather than somewhere out in the ocean. Since the shark is stuck in a small area, that has the potential to create tension for the situation. Why? Because the victims are trapped as well with nowhere to go. Unfortunately, poor script writing and execution prevented any good from happening on the screen. Don't even get me started on the abysmal 3D elements! They add nothing to the story and just make it even more embarrassing than it already is. If that's even possible! I'll go into more details with the 3D effects later. Another thing is how stupid all of the characters are. All of them make the situation more difficult than it has to be. They are all scrambling, thinking about how they're going to get rid of the shark. Here's the thing, the shark is in one area, unable to escape. Just call animal control, or shoot the stupid shark! The fact that the characters can't comprehend such an obvious answer to this problem is mind-blowing to me, for all the wrong reasons. I understand that characters in horror/thriller films are supposed to be dumb, but this is ridiculous. It makes you question the intelligence of the writers themselves, because they're most likely that stupid in real-life! But, the bottom line is, that it's the exact same premise as the first two movies, it just takes place in a different location. That is the epitome of lazy writing! All of the acting is average to just plain horrible. The only ones who appear to be trying are: Dennis Quaid and Lea Thompson. But, that doesn't mean their performances are perfect. It just means that they're the best of the worst. All of the characters are dumb and unlikeable. So, when the shark finally meets it's eventual comeuppance, it's nowhere near as satisfying as it should be. As for the rest of the performances from the cast, they do terribly! Bad writing will almost always equal bad performances. As for the special effects, the majority of them are garbage, especially the 3D elements, which are shown throughout the majority of this \"film\"! From the opening credits alone, you know exactly what kind of \"movie\" you're in for before it even starts. I'm not a fan of 3D elements in films or shows, and this \"movie\" just laments that fact. These are some of the worst, if not the absolute worst 3D effects I've seen in any movie. Even the shark itself looks more fake than the props used in the first two films. You'd think that the props would look better and more realistic over time, but, they just get worse and worse! The soundtrack, composed by Alan Parker, is an insult to the great John Williams. Saying that this film score pales in comparison to the first two movies is an understatement. John Williams is my all-time favorite film score composer, and Alan Parker was supposed to be the ideal replacement? What's the matter with these film makers? I don't blame John Williams for turning this \"movie\" down, it might have ruined his career! The only good element in this \"film\" are the sets/locations. They do create a somewhat decent atmosphere. You can't go wrong with filming your movie in SeaWorld, or anywhere else Florida! But, at the same time, putting the shark in SeaWorld was a bad idea. Why is that? Because, if children watch this \"movie\" and they love going to SeaWorld, seeing the shark there will most likely scare them away. Putting the shark in SeaWorld was a bad way to promote the park! They might as well say on the SeaWorld website: \"come visit SeaWorld today, and get eaten by great white sharks!\" See what I mean? What were the writers thinking? \"Jaws 3-D\" is one of the worst sequels I've ever seen. It's unnecessary and I feel no tension or drama while watching it. I just think to myself: \"is it over yet?!\" I'm giving this \"film\" only 1 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 2 out of 10 IMDB stars. Just stay away from \"Jaws 3-D\", you'll just be wasting your life while watching it. The reality is, as this franchise continues to limp forward with these pointless sequels for some reason, they just get worse and worse. Also, for some reason, we still have one more film left in this series to tare apart. Apparently, the great white sharks haven't learned their lesson either!",

Whereas the first two films were set in a New England sea resort and focused on the struggle of an everyman police chief against a force of nature, this entry gives us an amusement park, a dolphin trainer, and her dolphins.The change is most apparent when one listens to the soundtrack. Whereas John Williams's soundtrack was full of menace, the Jaws 3-D soundtrack is full of celebratory cues meant to show off Sea World. (Indeed, at times the film comes across as an advertisement for Sea World.) Even the shark cues come across as adventurous rather than suspenseful. Although it's a good score, it doesn't really fit a horror movie.The horror is further diminished by the lack of characters to care about. The performances are too broad to care about any of the main characters, particularly Louis Gossett Jr. doing Murray Hamilton-lite as the owner of Sea World. Moreover, most of the shark attack victims are depicted as unlikeable, eliminating any real sense of empathy.The only reason I gave this film four rather than three stars is that I loved it as a child. It's mainly good for nostalgia or showing younger children to introduce them to the Jaws series.",

Why did we have to go all the way to Sea World? Due to its different setting and the absence of some important characters from its predecessors, this movie does not even feel like it's part of the Jaws franchise.Thirdly and MOST IMPORTANTLY, the visual effects are TERRIBLE, its some of the worst I have ever seen, unlike its predecessors, many of the special effects look really badly done that the shark looked like a rubber toy, and at the final showdown, the shark was just standing still for 10 seconds not moving a single muscle.Fourthly, the action scenes with the sharks are seriously underwhelming and unlike Jaws and Jaws 2, they were not entertaining at all, I felt like I was able to doze off the film for 1 minute and not miss much during the action scenes and in general.Lastly, Why the hell is the shark at times roaring like a lion? Just Why? A short does not even roar this loud. That is just unrealistic.Unlike its predecessor (Jaws 2). This movie has little to no positives, it is full of flaws and is really badly crafted, and I am quite shocked that there was a sequel after a movie this dismal.",

The bad special effects, acting, direction, writing, etc. have all been mentioned to death. And yes, it was a really big dumb mistake to go all 3-D gimmicky. That's probably why they picked Joe Alves, the production designer from the first Jaws movie as well as others (Escape From New York, for example, another very grimy-dark and somewhat shoddy looking movie) to direct--the guy was obviously better with everything other than the human portions of the scenery. Or maybe not. The whole movie looks very flat and colorless...lifeless. It's strange.No, I think what really kills this movie for me is that seems very...I don't know...UNPLEASANT. There are ways to take even the most misanthropic horror, the silliest and most glaringly fake special effects, and make it compelling, interesting, and somehow cool to watch. It's a very subtle thing which I can't put my finger on. Jaws 3 doesn't come close. As ridiculous as the movie is, it tries to be relentlessly dark, and there are hints of a kind of nastiness or something which doesn't scare me, or even horrify me, but just make me feel very uncomfortable instead, like I need to take a shower afterwards. Perhaps it tries to be too literal when it begs to be stylized. Perhaps it's too dead serious when it's obviously claptrap. There some kind of jarring collision going on, something isn't working right. Basically the thing is the visual equivalent of indigestion.I will admit that certain things like sound effects work almost too well--the crunching as another vapid Floridian becomes fish food, the muffled underwater groans and shouts. But it's not horrifying in a good, entertaining way, you know? There is one very inventive shot, I also have to admit--the one prick cameraman diver gets eaten, and you watch the poor bastard getting chewed from INSIDE the shark's gullet.I think I may have an answer. It seems like unlike many horror movies, which simply like to show off gore effects and photogenic ways to kill people, Jaws 3 seems to revel specifically in helpless suffering, prolonging people's pain while they die. Even that poor fish at the beginning doesn't just get eaten...the severed head floats there half-alive for half a minute, uselessly working its mouth, just to drive the point home. It's a distinctly sadistic movie. Perhaps we need to coin a new movie genre for films like this: loathing movies. As such Jaws 3 would probably rank up there with The Passion Of The Christ or something as one of the all-time greats. It's a crappie (pun intended), extremely unpleasant movie to watch overall, but it does achieve its dubious goal unnervingly well. I will give it that.",

The director and writers were part of the original Jaws, so it would seem they are capable of creating something of value.  What happened?  Let's take a closer look:  It seems that this is the only film Joe Alves has EVER directed!  Well, thank goodness he won't be releasing anymore of this toxic sludge upon the world of film.  Writer Peter Benchley, writer of the original Jaws, was a writer on this film as well.  A closer look at his writing history reveals him as a writer on: Jaws, The Deep, Cruel Jaws, The Beast, Creature (White Shark)... Hmmm, I detect a theme here.  Peter Benchley is the Mario Puzo of shark movies.  Another writer on this film was Carl Gottlieb.  It seems like 1983 was a bad year for Mr. Gottlieb, because the same year this sludge was written, he also wrote the bomb known as \"Dr. Detroit\".  This director of \"Amazon Women on the Moon\" seems to actually have a better career as an actor than a director, appearing in such films as \"Johnny Dangerously\" and \"Clueless\".  Aside from the Jaws films he only wrote on 4 movies.This overwhelming evidence seems to prove only one thing.  Stephen Spielberg was the only production talent on Jaws, and without him and the high-caliber actors of the original film, hacks like Peter Benchley and his band of cronies will never create another watchable film again.",

This is one of Dennis Quaid's early movies and probably one he doesn't put on his resume.  He tries hard, but the movie is stale and dull in its first half.  It does liven up in the second half when the shark attacks the underwater park.  What these scenes lack in logic at least they work to some degree.

Filming-wise, it's a long, expensive, and arduous process that winds up making the rest of the movie look muddy. In JAWS 3 (alternatively called JAWS 3-D) the story shifts from Amity Island down to Sea World in Florida. They're just about to unveil a new addition to their water park when... you guessed it, a Great White shark swims in and messes up their plans. And it's up to Mike Brody (played expertly by Dennis Quaid) and a motley assortment of marine experts to stop it. While the story is compelling and exciting, everything just feels like a re-tread. Like a Xerox copy of a Xerox copy. The formula that worked so well the first time got faded a bit by JAWS 2 and faded even further with this one. As for the 3-D effects, many look so darn fake. The most laughable of which is the stationary image of the shark as it \"swims\" toward an underwater command center. It's so unfortunate, because there are genuinely good performances in this by not only Quaid, but also Bess Armstrong, Louis Gossett Jr, and a young Lea Thompson. With a little more thought and script revisions, perhaps even dropping the 3D idea, this film might've been better. But still, at least this movie's better than JAWS: THE REVENGE!",

            "content": "3D is now commonplace in cinema but now these days, movies are not made specifically for 3D. But, in the 1980s that was the case. There were several films throughout the 80s and 90s released specifically in 3D like Friday the 13th Part III, Amityville 3-D, and Freddy's Dead. In 1983, another 3D film was made and it was Jaws 3-D. Jaws 3-D had a troubled production with studio interference and what not. The film would be directed by Joe Alves and this would be his only directing credit. The film stars Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr. The film was a decent financial success but failed critically. So much so that the film was nominated for five Razzies.Years after the events of Jaws 2, Michael Brody works at SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida. While working there, his brother, Sean, comes to visit. It just so happens when everyone is there, a shark manages to get inside the theme park and starts to wreak havoc.Where do I even begin? Well, I should note that I have a regular DVD version of this film (more specifically a three movie set that has Jaws 2, 3, and 4). So I cannot see this film in it's original 3D. So by itself, it looks like garbage but not in an obnoxious in your face manner like in Friday the 13th Part III. In fact the intentional 3D effects that are supposed to be of the in your face variety are somewhat subtle. The other effects are very flat and get worse and worse as the film moves on. Now, there is a BluRay version of this film that has the 3D version and from what I have been told, it actually makes the film mildly better. So, if you are mildly curious I suppose checking it out would not be a bad idea. Now the quality of the footage all around does not look good on the standard DVD and perhaps it is because the film had different cameras for 3D. Again, maybe the BluRay release fixes this. Now moving on to the whole story here. Jaws 2 was basically a rehash of the original film. This film is still about a shark attacking but the film does get creative with it's location, a theme park. More specifically SeaWorld. But even then, this ends up being a blatant advertisement for SeaWorld. So, they should have just had it set at some generic theme park. Sure, it shows off their budget, but I hate seeing blatant advertisements. At least it is not as bad as the product placement in The Wizard. Now the story revolves around sharks getting into SeaWorld. Now, this wouldn't have happened if there was not a gate that separates the park and the ocean. Now, I am just a simple amateur film critic so maybe there is a reason why a simple gate separates the park from the ocean. I have no clue but I am gonna call it a flaw in the design. The acting here is not very good at all. No big shock there. The characters are not even that good either. Honestly, the Brody brothers are boring and dull. To be honest, it feels like it was all shoehorned in. It is entirely irrelevant that they are the Brody brothers. But, apparently this is Universal's fault because they forced screenwriter Carl Gottlieb to put them in there. Another character that should be mentioned is the park owner Calvin Bouchard. This guy is basically the mayor character from the first two films in a sense. I mean this guy clearly has no clue how to run a theme park like SeaWorld. For me, this film is almost too lighthearted almost because the shark is hardly present most of the time. This makes for a boring film especially when you have dull and boring characters. There is very little suspense in key scenes but that is not to say there is not any. There are maybe a total of two or three scenes that have some sort of suspense. Which says a lot considering that the original Jaws relied on the John Williams score to help build suspense and this film barely has it. I honestly think that it was used once and that was during the intro. The kills are pretty basic and the one thing that I can confidently say about this film in regards with doing something better than a sequel is that this film has more gore than Jaws 2. Now with all this movies nearly overwhelming faults, this film's original script was supposedly fairly decent and probably would have been better received than Jaws 2. If you ever find the film's original script, give it a read through and see how it compares.Jaws 3-D is another Jaws sequel that decreases in quality. Poor special effects, poor acting and poor characters really drag this sequel that had potential as seen in it's original script.",

            "content": "What is it with Jaws and the hate for its sequels? Jaws 3D was a bold departure from the first two movies in the franchise. \nThe action movies from a beach setting to a high tech water park and the story is focused on the sons of the police chief from the first two movies who are now grown up and working. \nThis is obviously a progression too far for some, who obviously wanted to see another chief Brody movie, set on a beach and arguing with a mayor about whether there is a shark or not. What is interesting is that the newly released Meg seems to borrow heavily from Jaws 3D and the Meg was a remarkable success...\nWhat this movie adds to the first are better effects in 3D, a more complex story line, more action and arguably bigger stars, while still using some of the same elements which made the first movies so popular. \nThere are other Jaws movies apart from the first two, don't let other people put you off a decent film because they dont like progress....",

It was a pretty rowdy group that wanted and waited to be entertained by Jaws 3-D that opening weekend. By the end of the film everyone was so disappointed that they jeered when it was revealed that the lovable sea creatures had NOT been horribly eaten by the shark.

            "content": "\"JAWS 3D\" (1983, Alves) boasts the most fun plot of the franchise, the biggest and most factually incorrect shark of the franchise (although \"JAWS THE REVENGE\" (1987, Sargent) is probably the stronger contestant for that accolade), and best cowboy of the franchise. It is also peppered with LSD fuelled defunct 3D moments.Personally I would find this the most entertaining outing for the Brodies and their shark pals if it weren't for the stomach turning anti-shark propaganda found in the lazy script.\nMy biggest problem with \"JAWS\" (1975, Spielberg), aside from the poor, empty visuals and stupid ending, is that it was so effective in scaring people away from the ocean for fear of swimming carnivorous mouths and opened the floodgates for wannabe Quints to go slaughter fishing. The message that sharks are our enemy was something interpreted from \"JAWS\" rather than actually endorsed by it whereas \"JAWS 3\" runs with the speciesism to absolutely ridiculous lengths.The thing is the original \"JAWS\" (be it Benchley or Spielberg) does carry a certain weight and has an apocryphal poignancy, which is why it captures our imaginations. The follow-up's Jason Vorhees Shark could have been a parody of slasher films. But this film, about an aggrieved parent shark stuck in a sea life center, belongs in the comedy aisle where it was originally meant to have ended up.The 1/10 is compulsory for a film this scummy but for entertainment value (read the CRACKED article about why JAWS 3D is a masterpiece for more information) it's certainly at least a 4.",

I was not alive to see it in theaters so I bought the video 10 years after it came out and I was convinced that it was a 3-D film.  However the movie wasn't bad it continues the adventure of a family that is attacked by a fatal shark.  The plot was good and the casting was fair but I began to laugh when I heard a shark roar under water like something from Jurrasic Park.  This film is a complete joke compared to the first and second but is definitely worth watching if you like these movies.

Lets just get this straight, no sequel was ever going to beat Jaws, especially without Spielberg. Jaws 3 doesnt come close at all but it is certainly better than most people say it is. Its kind of a guilty pleasure.\nThe story is trying something new. Its moved away from Amity Island and put the shark in Sea World. Yes, it does sound a little bit dumb but its also kind of campish fun. Atleast, it didnt keep taking place on Amity Island.\nThe acting is pretty much sub par. Dennis Quaid is the only one to do a passable job. Louis Gossett Jr. is adequate but the rest of the people are flat. The acting is not a strength but this film isnt about acting.\nJaws 3 is enjoyable. It lacks the suspense and tension of the first film and even the second one. But this is campy fun. However, the complaint I have is the ending. The scene with the shark coming towards the glass. With today's modern technology that might not be a bad scene. Yet its completely laughable. Even in 3-D it would have been excellent. Its a joke here. This film might not be great but it certainly is better than most say.",

            "content": "Well Jaws 3-D is a bad film that really tarnished the series for good, followed by possibly an even worse film. The film focuses on Sea World in Florida where a Great White of some sort has snuck into the giant lagoon that they have at the park. So working at the park are Mike Brody (Quaid), son of the chief of course from part one and Katharine Morgan (Armstrong) chief biologist and girlfriend of his. Both do things with dolphins and eventually his brother Sean comes down as well. Well things start to go down hill as some beefy guy (grant) is missing, some divers among others and they find out there is a great white in the lagoon. So the owner Calvin Bouchard (Gossett Jr.) hires his pal Fitzroy (Mackcorkindale), some playboy esc adventure type to kill the shark and on live TV! Yea I bet that would fly. After some talking with Morgan he realizes they would make more cash if they could capture it (obviously). They manage to capture it and put it on display, but of course as in real life sharks, especially whites don't do to well in captivity and it dies. Funny how they gave the shark a pen that could barley hold small fish let alone a ten foot white. But meanwhile in one of the tunnels people can view from underwater a body has been found floating. It's the beef cake. What's left of him and Katherine determines that it must have been done by a far larger shark...lets say the mother, about 35 feet long. Soon the mom starts killing, reeking havoc, breaking the tunnels and stuff. Fitzroy and his pal go down to trap it, while Mike fixes something under water. Fitzroy gets swallowed and then it goes after mike. In a very stupid scene the shark smashes through the underwater glass, but is killed by the grenade still attached to what's left of Fitzroy's arm in the shark's mouth and it blows up...wow right out of the screen! Bad movie, but at least the dolphins live.OK anyone that knows anything about the series knows this is a bad film. Just about everything about it is bad. Everything! Even the setting isn't that great. I'm surprised that sea world would want publicity from this film about a killer shark, maybe that's why it didn't kill that many people. The acting is terrible, even from Jr. who I like. What the hell script did they give the man that you can barley understand what he is saying? There were more than a few parts where the sound is off and the mouths don't match. And it's not just Jr., its all badly acted to the point where you don't care what happens to any of the people. The first 2 movies I actually felt bad for most of the people, but from hence forth....no. You will beg for the shark to kill them. The setting may have been the only redeemable part in this film as in Revenge. But still the shark barley even kills anyone in this and it's been highly toned down to where the shark is now slow and very inefficient. The shark itself is huge, but very fake, not as bad as Revenge but very close. For the young shark they use almost all shots of a real great white sped up on film which looked very poor. And most of the film the creature is apparently stuck in some vent shaft and manages to swim backwards\u0085OK did anyone read a book on sharks? And of course the 3-D aspect. It dose look very bad, but why is it that Friday the 13th part 3 it didn't look nearly as bad as the shots they made here? The dumbest being Jaws coming at the glass underwater at the end. Seriously if you haven't seen this it was a one peace prop just coming straight at the camera and didn't even move it was so bad. Then it blows up and peaces of the jaw come at the viewer. Now granted it probably looked cool on screen with the glasses so I'm going easy, but even at that, they made it look so fake. And there are plenty of total goofs, like when Jaws is behind the water skiers, being a 35ft shark with its dorsal fin so close the mouth would have been under the skiers already. One part that stood out was when they get the corpse of the guy it really looked nasty and stripped away. However since it had been there for a number of days all the fish would have stripped it, so even that was silly. Overall I think this is slightly better then Revenge, but just barley. It may come down just to which one you prefer rather then the specifics. Let's say 2 and half out of ten stars, don't forget to look out for McFly's mom.",

These three factors do compensate for the poor acting and a poor script that this movie delivered.Jaws 3-D was always going to be a tough project especially knowing that the first Jaws was one of the best movies of all time and that Jaws 2 was a decent movie.Helpful Hint - try and watch the movie in 3-D, although it isn't as appealing these days as it was in the 80's!!! lol",

My main complaint would be the very poor use of special effects, which was quite unexpected, as previous Jaws films had effects that were quite impressive for their time. It really angered me to see the treatment of the baby shark when it was captured. (Yes, of course I know this is just a film, and the shark was a prop.) The only reason I say that is because the film seemed to not incorporate much scientific fact, if any at all into the Sharks biology and instincts. All in all, it is probably my least favorite of all of the Jaws films. I don't want to say I totally hated the movie, but it was difficult to sit through the entire thing.",

Certainly, it isn't a great film like the original \"Jaws\", but it is what I consider a decent sequel and an enjoyable movie that works and that is much better than much of what passes for \"good\" movies, presently.Although the basic premise of a \"monster\" eating people is extremely old, I think the plot formed around this idea is rather clever and intriguing - a great white breaking into Sea World.Many of the film's critics bash the film for the unrealistic scenario of having a mother Great White follow its baby and seek revenge for the baby's death, and by criticizing it thus, they are showing their own stupidity.If such critics actually spent some time paying attention to the film instead of trying to feel superior, they would realize that the mother shark breaks into Sea World and gives birth there. Also, the mother completely ignores the baby (realistically). It isn't the baby's capture and death that sets the mother off - it's the decision to shut off the water pumps that provide it with its oxygen supply in the place where it was lurking that causes it to finally start exploring the park.Also, the special effects are damn good for an 80's flick and are much better than lame CGI in modern films. Sure, CGI has the capability of being realistic, but that capability hasn't been reached yet.This is a fine film that deserves more credit than it is given.

Where the owner plans to make new shows and attractions to keep the stocks up, but the park has an unwelcome visitor as a great white shark has been harassing the park. So the kids of Chief Brody capture the beast and the owner decides to use the shark as an attraction to make money, but unfortunately the shark they caught is a baby and it dies in the exhibit. They realize that the real killer is the mother who now seeks vengeance for the death of her child and attacks the park visitors. So the Brody family must try to kill the beast and save the park from becoming a buffet for the monstrous jaws of death.I do consider the first Jaws is one of my favorites and all time classics.Jaws 2 is a pretty good sequel and continues the story of its beloved characters.Jaws 3d is an absolute piece of garbage and worse than Jurassic Park 3.I will take credits of the shark attacking SeaWorld, but the characters are boring and the effects in this movie are terrible.What even bugs me is that Roy Scheider nor Richard Dreyfuss could return and I still found this awful movie very stupid and I absolutely hate it.3/10.",

            "content": "Having been one of the unlucky people who saw this movie in 3D on it's original release, thought I would take a moment to comment on it after seeing it on the worst films list.  At this writing, it ranks number 49, but is probably worst than that.  Believe me, even the 3D effects such as they were didn't help this turkey and it's amazing that the career of any of the actors involved survived it. Well, some of their careers didn't, as Bess Armstrong and Simon MacCorkindale went on to do bad television series and/or miniseries.  Though you may never have a chance to experience the film in 3D take my word for it when I tell you that you didn't miss anything.  The 3D effects were minimal, for example, in most scenes the shark was too big for the 3d effect to work, and other than some splashing water, and one floating fish head, there wasn't any sense in even bothering with filming it in 3D.  On top of this, never has the audio in a film been as bad as this one.  There are times when you have to strain to hear any of the dialogue.  Then again, you probably wouldn't want to hear it so you're better off.   \nI suppose I could talk about the acting, but there isn't any.  The worst offender here is Louis Gossett Jr. who should have known better.  He spends most of the film shouting mumbled dialogue which is totally unintelligible, as if he were in a hurry to get his part over with so he could leave the studio lot as quickly as possible without being seen.  He must have had some foresight into the big stinkeroo this legendary dead fish tale would become.The film must have made some money though.  That's why we were next subjected to Jaws IV, which goes onto prove that Carp is Carp, no matter what number you put behind it.  As for any excitement and suspense, my advice is for you to open a can of Star Kist.  That would be more thrilling than this mess, and take up a whole lot less of your time.  Or better yet, just watch a Charlie Tuna commercial if you want to be entertained.  Till Next timeNext Class Please",

There are so many issues with this one and I want to point out some of the highlights or low-lights depending on how you look at it.1. Obviously anybody watching this movie is watching it for the shark but, they could have at least attempted to give some attention to the characters and stories. The only time this movie has your interest at all is when the shark is present. It felt like all the actors/actresses were just going through the motions but, you can't blame them when you consider what they're working with.2. Why was so much of the movie almost pitch black? I realize that it wouldn't be realistic for it to bright underwater, especially at night but, enough light to actually see what is happening would've been nice. There are many scenes where you might as well close your eyes since you can't make anything out. That includes most of the final 10 or 15 minutes and a scene early on that is not even in the water.3. As I stated earlier, you are watching because of the shark but, you don't really see much of it and it's too dark to actually see it most of the time it is on screen.4. This is not so much a complaint as an observation. Watch for a special effect shot at the end that is so bad, it's hard to believe it made it into the movie even if it was a 3-D shot. It's the next to last 3-D shot if I remember correctly.",

They surprise us in how they eventually evolve as the story comes to its inevitable conclusions...What we may initially perceive as the secondary Villain (the manager of this aquatic theme park, \"Calvin\"), turns out to be just an ordinary person at a loss for words, and tries his best to save the endangered tourists trapped underwater.  Unlike the previous two films (in which we're subjected to the pig-headed-ness of one dollar-hungry Mayor), Calvin made me laugh when I realized his character was just all attitude and 'talk.'  He is speechless when everybody realizes they have a serious situation on their hands: 35 feet of man-eating death!The heroes (God save what's left of their present acting careers!) also prove brave and honorable.My favorite character, however, was the calm and rational female tour guide that succeeded in 'tranquilizing' the trapped visitors until rescue divers could successfully bail them out.  Here you have this short lady telling the much taller adults and children to conserve their energy and air, so that escape seems all the more possible.Brief Review: J2 was pretty much along the same lines as its original... except here we have a regatta of mostly teens and twenty-somethings trying to stay afloat, and the shark in question keeps getting bigger by the time we reach J4.J4 stinks and sinks!  Pray that someday we'll all be allowed to go back to our beaches without the likes of Michael Caine and Lorraine Gary polluting our oceans.  These landlubbers belong either on the Broadway stage or beside their mogul husbands, sitting quietly counting their box-office money.See Jaws 3.  If anything, it's great watching this truly unique aquatic show, where 'red popcorn' goes flying off into the audience.",

And of course, bloodshed ensues.This movie is famously known for being the most violent out of the four JAWS movies. And it is. The acting is not as good as in the previous two films. It wasn't the worst acting I have seen in a movie. it was decent. And believable. I thought Dennis Quaid, Bess Armstrong, Louis Gossett Jnr and Lea Thompson did a great job. The rest were fairly decent.This movie came out at a time when 3D was all the rage and it shows. I grew up with this movie on VHS and never got the chance to see it in 3D until it came out on Blu-Ray. Even then, the 3D effects were not that good. Thats really the only issue I had with the movie. The special effects were not that great. It was great to see the mechanical shark when you actually saw it, though most of it was seen in pretty dark water. And it was mostly its head. Other then the dodgy effects, this movie is not half bad. Its an entertaining movie when you are having a JAWS marathon. It is not as bad as JAWS: THE REVENGE, despite what some people say. It is a decent enough of a movie to sit back and chill with your family or mates and kill some time for 90 or so minutes. This movie is still better then a lot of the shark movies made now days on the cheap. If you like the previous two JAWS movies, then you should really watch this one.

However, the manager (Louis Gosset Jr.) makes a careless decision and the shark dies.  Within hours, the shark's mammoth-sized mother has arrived on the scene for bloodthristy revenge.  Dan, on the previous page, clearly stated the mystery of Carl Gottleib, co-writer of Jaws and Jaws II, coming up with this idea.  Actually, it probably seemed a good idea at the time which explains the presence of such established stars like Quaid and Gosset Jr.  But, it turned out to be a thumbs-down.  The film is daft and unexciting and relies more on blood and guts coming out of the screen than on suspense.  The shark is bigger but no match for the two that took residence at Amity, it looks fake, roars and swims (or rather crawls) at a snails-pace and misses out on most of its potential-victims due to its clumsiness.  But, of course, its just a model and so the direction is really to blame.  Fortuanately, its quite fast-paced so watching it doesn't really do any harm.

I can't believe any movie with that music and a shark could not be scary in the least. The Jaws great white is the most terrifying monster in cinema history - even worse tahn the xenomoprhs from the Aliens films and The Predator from Predator (1987)  - but it just doesn't scare here. But since this was made for 3D cinemas, the normal TV and video version can't really be criticised. It's like recording a video game and then showing it in the cinema - it's in the wrong place where it was never intended to be. Therefore, Jaws 3 doesn't work. But you can't blame the makers. Jaws 3D worked in the cinema, and that's what they made it for. If you're a Jaws fan like me, you'll have to get it. At least you can imagine how good it was in the 3D cinemas.

The story in this one is that Dennis Quaid plays the now adult son of Roy Scheider, whom played the police chief in the first two films. Quaid takes a job working at Sea World in Orlando, and begins to strike up a romance with Bess Armstrong, a dolphin trainer and biologist at the water park. A maintenance worker gets mangled and killed in a late night attack by a baby great white. When the young shark is discovered, it is captured with plans to exploit it for more tourist dollars. Then the baby dies. And momma gets ticked. Very ticked. When Momma shows up, I have to say that the deaths are done well. Especially the poor guy whom gets chewed up, and we see (and hear) the carnage from WITHIN momma shark's mouth.The rest of the movie follows Quaid, Armstrong, and a few other noteworthy thespians such as Lou Gosset Jr., and Lea Thompson, as they try to outwit the momma shark's vengeful streak. This movie was released in the middle of the 3-D revival of 1983, and several scenes are effective (the floating arm comes to mind), but many are just window dressing (the submersibles), or just painfully goofy (the shark approaches the camera head on, but DOES NOT swish it's tail back and forth as it swims. The shark looks like a plastic toy moving on a track!)Just forget the earlier two films, and just turn your brain on auto-pilot, and you'll enjoy this film just fine. I just have one question, to anybody whom may know... When I first saw the film in the mid 80's on BETAMAX (!!!), the title logo of \"JAWS III\" was animated in a cool red and yellow 1950's scifi lettering style, and they \"chomped\" at the viewer to the accompaniment of a rocket-like swooshing sound and a loud CHOMP!!! Viewing a videocassette made in the mid 90's, the swooshing sound is there, the CHOMP sound effect is there, but the cool 3-D animated logo is gone. It is replaced by a still frame of \"Jaws III\".

            "content": "Jaws 3 (a.k.a. Jaws 3-D) ties with Jaws: The Revenge as being the worst sequel and I must say, this one is pretty bad. Ok, first the plot. A baby great white shark sneaks into Sea World in Florida, followed by it's 35-foot mommy who wreaks havoc at the park. Michael Brody (Sheriff Brody's son) is an adult now who works at the park and soon discovers, along with his girlfriend Kathryn, that this shark is loose and will kill anyone. Also along for the ride is Michael's younger brother, Sean, who was almost killed by a great white years earlier when he was a kid (see Jaws 2). Ok, now my opinion. Terrible. This film trashes all of the suspense of Jaws 1 and 2 and replaces it with shoddy 3-D effects and some bad acting as well. They totally changed the setting from Amity to Sea World and not one of the cast members from the earlier films appears. The 3-D effects! Woah! What can I say about the 3-D effects? Here goes. Everytime I see the shark heading for the underwater control center it makes me laugh. No movement, the fins don't move, the mouth doesn't even move and the expressions on the people's faces are hysterical. If you ever need a good laugh one night be sure to rent this movie, you'll be glad you did.",

            "content": "I just watched this movie last night.I must say, the first hour of it is somewhat compelling. But the fact of the matter remains, I have been a big fan of sharks since I was about three years old, and what this film does is retain the shark physics very well. Shark behavior, on the other hand, is completely reversed (great whites only tend to go in for \"hit-and-run attacks\") but that's really not the point of this film.What this movie is made for is purely entertainment. While the first Jaws had a tremendous amount of psychological tension, this film provides only death, death, death. More people are killed in this film than any other Jaws film. Not to mention that they made the shark the largest it could possibly be (35 ft). The 35 foot great white is as rare as fist-sized diamonds, but we see one in this film--thank God, though, for the size of the shark does save the film ever so slightly.The first hour of the film consists of tension regarding a smaller, ten foot long baby shark that is kept in captivity, being the only great white in such a state. Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong provide the leading roles here, and they are both incredibly good actors that have been given an incredibly mundane script. However, as a shark fan, I recommend this film for its scientific accuracy in the first half.Once the information is relayed to Louis Gosset Jr.'s character, Calvin, the story begins to turn sour. At first, the shark appears among a group of black-tips and sand tigers (less dangerous and smaller aquarium-type sharks) outside of SeaWorld's more expensive dining area, and it really scares the living hell out of the tourists (imagine a 35-foot black-eyed monster suddenly appearing around sharks no larger than perhaps six feet right in front of you).From there on, the whole movie turns to trash. It's like Godzilla underwater. The shark looks claymated (seriously) and it's vile and malicious. Sharks really aren't that smart. I don't believe any shark would ever smash its way into an undersea control room, but this one does. Also, I recall reading that sharks need to keep moving through the sea to survive (other than the sleeper shark), but this one has no trouble camping out for ten minutes to claim several victims. Also, I realize that this shark needs quite a bit of food to sustain itself (hello, 35 friggin' FEET!!!) but the fact is, it eats a few people, and yet the first of the people it eats in the second half of the film is not even swallowed, even after another victim is (see the film, you will understand what I mean by this).The best part of this film is the part in which a diver is trapped inside the mouth of the beast. For about three minutes we watch as this diver is chewed up (and really empathetically feel his tension). The camera angles for this time frame all appear inside the monster's mouth and the whole experience is coupled with a sense of intense claustrophobia that cannot be replicated in any other film.This movie was overall a hunk of garbage, but to fans of sharks like myself, a few shots of vodka can make Jaws III very interesting, but further than that, I would call it utter crap.",

Basically there is some underwater sea life park and some folks go down to check it out in a little orange diving machine. Unbelievable! You wouldn't think for one minute that they were using a miniature centre made from yogurt pots, or a diving machine so super-imposed one side of it totally disappears in one scene! Nah, great SFX. They could even be compared to the might of the Doctor Who films made in the sixties, with flying saucers on strings etc. Oh sorry, I forgot - they weren't actually made from yogurt pots.You can probably figure out that I dislike this movie a lot, and you'd be right.

It should never have been released in Flat 2D form.As 'Jaws 3' the film is practically unwatchable, its like going to see a musical without any songs or music. When watched in 3D this film really shines, i love it. The plot details are secondary, you are there to see a 3D movie and it delivers in every respect.Case in point, the 'horible fake arm floating underwater', when you see this in 3D it looks absolutely great, faultless, you can practically touch the two bones sticking out. The underwater sub, when it does a 'fly by' - wow, The skeletons arm - wow, Even the radio on the counter in the background behind Brody while hes having breakfast!! - wow!! The infamous shark coming at the control room window that does look horrible in 2D, as it looks like a cut out that stops dead as the window smashes. Watch it in 3D and it is seamless, the shark is perfectly integrated, shadows moving across its back, the slow motion creates a greater 3d effect and you can hardly tell the shark has stopped when the glass smashes (which also looks great).In summary this film is REALLY GOOD as a 3D movie the effects are seamless and brilliant, every shot is designed to be seen in 3D. To release this in flat 2D destroys the films intentions completely so please bear that in mind when proclaiming it as having 'the worst special effects ever'",

Jaws 2 was a fun if slightly misguided sequel, that at least gave the people what they wanted: more of the same. Come Jaws 3 and 4, there is nothing left of that classic original. Both are among the worst sequels ever made.While The Revenge is a mostly joyless and incompetently made trash heap, Jaws 3D is a more interesting and bizarre beast. It is one of the worst blockbusters ever produced, but that isn't due to laziness or lack of interest. It's because they tried really hard to make something great and failed so spectacularly!The stories are true. The effects are some of the worst ever made for a studio film. The camera is horribly blurred. There are shots that last just long enough to make it awkward. All of this brought on by the insistence of 3D. Topping that, the acting is average at best and the plot is creative but so out of touch with the rest of the series.It is a terrible, terrible film. Why 9 out of 10 then? Because Jaws 3 is funnier than most comedies I have ever seen. It is a huge guilty pleasure. Whenever someone asks me what bad films I love, this along with Dungeons and Dragons, and Sleepwalkers are the ones I go to.It is laugh a minute and I find such joy whenever watch it. This is helped by the film having some good music (no John Williams but hey) and Richard Mathesons script (which he understandably disowned) working as a blockbuster story that supplies some fun set pieces. Also, if you can actually see this in 3D, I recommend doing so. It's some good optical effects, that just don't work in 2D.I showed this film to my wife, who can't stand creature features, and she found it to be enjoyable. It isn't a film I recommend unless you enjoy the so bad it's good part of cinema. Personally, it is my favourite of the Jaws sequels. That may not be for its quality, but I had fun regardless.",

The CG was very unrealistic, and you could clearly tell where it was inserted. The shark... well, I'd imagine that \"Bruce\" (the original shark for \"Jaws\") is turning in his prop room grave, or wherever they decided to put him. The shark they built for this one didn't look much like a shark, and in several scenes, the shark was obviously the puppet. In the first \"Jaws\" film, it was harder to tell.Sorry fan boys and girls.

A 25-foot Great White in the first film is conceivable, but a slow-moving 35-footer takes all the scariness away from being a Great White.  Also, a death count of 3 (4 including the pre-credits fish) is a bit disappointing for 'New depths of terror'.The 3-D effects inevitably look rubbish on the small screen and the stop motion miniatures are shocking (The final explosion is still satisfying despite the slightly naff re-formation of the jaws).  It was nice of the shark creators to try and get the protruding jaws effect of a real great white but it just doesn't work and simply looks like they forgot to attach the teeth to the shark.As far as the series goes, the film's a real disappointment but it's not frustratingly unwatchable.

I had the misfortune of actually seeing this one in the theater when it was theatrically released, one of the first flicks I saw at the then-new multiplex cinema - with 15 different theaters - that had opened in my town.I had previously seen both Jaws and Jaws 2 and enjoyed them both, Jaws 2 being a solid-enough (if not spectacular as the original) sequel. Jaws 3 and Jaws 4 are both crummy movies; arguing which one is worse than the other being an exercise in futility.A lot of plot holes. The Brody brothers in 1975 were roughly 4 and 8 years old. Three years later in Jaws 2, they were roughly 12 and 17 years old. In Jaws 3 - eight years after the first Jaws - they are in their early and late 20's. In Jaws 3, the entire movie supposedly takes place in Sea World, Orlando. Despite Orlando being in the center of the state of Florida, in the Jaws 3 universe Sea World is located directly adjacent to what appears to be the Atlantic Ocean.Anyway, in Jaws 3, the Sea World water park is centered around a large lagoon. However, is it even remotely plausible that even the largest lagoon could manage to mask the presence of not one but two Great White sharks for several days? One assumes these sharks (the bigger of the two being 35 feet in length) would be feeding on the Sea World aquatic life from the get-go, and even in a large lagoon a 35-foot Great White would be spotted fairly quickly.Seeing as the plot itself is utterly ridiculous, one is basically left with the 3-D and the kills. Well, if you're watching Jaws 3 at home, you're not watching it in the original 3-D format. What you are watching is a film that has washed-out colors (the result of transferring the 3-D format to a non-3-D format) and a grainy visual feel. As for the kills, well, there is one that results in the victim being swallowed whole by the shark and provides a neat POV from inside the shark's mouth. The other kills are fairly boring. And even the number of shark scenes and kills themselves is outweighed by the amount of screen time devoted to the main characters galivanting around the park and talking. Dialogue is fine when you have a memorable screenplay with memorable characters speaking memorable lines. Jaws 3 has none of these things.I will say some of the 3-D stuff WAS effective when I saw it in the theater. Again, you don't get any of that when seeing it at home. What you get is a slow, ponderous, pointless sequel in a franchise that would have been better off ending with the 2nd movie.",

How they can actually call this movie 'Jaws', not 'The Haunted Surfboard', I don't know. Poor, poor, Spielberg.I didn't believe one bit that there was a shark in the waters, even though I did in Jaws 1 and 2. Firstly, the special effects were so out of date. In the dolphin scene, where they first saw the shark, when you see the Great White for the first time, I found that they just stole the footage from an old National Geographic Documentary. Secondly, this movie was full of sexual references. For example, Sean Brody says to his older brother Michael Brody, \"I was so close to doing it in the water last night.\" after doing something inappropriate at the beach the previous night. Finally, the amount of shark facts they got wrong was just tremendous. I completely lost count. Overall, if you want to watch all of the 'Jaws' movies, I advise you skip this to 'Jaws: The Revenge' for nothing important happens in this movie. So, under no circumstances (except for a good laugh) watch this movie EVER. Or else you'll find yourself being sick.",

            "content": "And its not coming from the garbage bin behind Long John Silver's. *(WARNING,THERE MAYBE POSSIBLE SPOILERS.DON'T READ UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN THE MOVIE ALREADY)*This movie got a low voting from me for a good reason.Everything is screwed up in this movie,including its facts about sharks.It's just really cheesy and stupid,with gross out special effects to make it look cool.Not to mention a thing called 3-D from the eighties,mainly used to doctor up movies with bad plotting,terrible acting,and a lame script.And this painful sequel is no exception.It opens up at night under the ocean,with theme song on cue.The unseen creature is stalking prey,but it's not a human.Instead it decides to go after a Moray eel,chasing it into rocks.Here is where the movie starts to mess up,letting us know it's going to be lame.It shows us a camera shot of the shark's POV,getting ready to snap off the eel's head.But,instead of the lower half of the eel floating away,it's the head even though we saw the it get bit off.And was this seen REALLY necessary,just for shock value?Couldn't the shark gone after bigger prey,like say an elephant seal?Why would something that large bother with something that's nothing more than a crumb?And I didn't know eels could bleed that much to dye the ocean red.Enough about that,now about our heroes.The story centers around Michael and Sean Brody(spelling correction),all grown up and working at Sea World now.Everything is fine for them,one is a dolphin trainer and the other I'm not sure what he does.Probably rehabilitating  animals or something.I'm sorry,I haven't seen the movie in a long time,so I don't remember every detail.I also remember that they're falling in love with two girls,one of which is an animal rehabilitater for sure.They are looking forward to the opening to a new attraction called Undersea Kingdom,which the tunnels go under water so tourists can see tropical fish and other animals. What they don't plan on is a greedy,Great White shark terrorizing the theme park,or menacing the people.Like I couldn't have figured that out by myself with the title.It's called Jaws 3-D isn't it?The first victim ends up being a guy who is repairing the dolphins' pens.He is suddenly attacked and pulled under water,and isn't seen again until much later.No one at Sea World bothers trying to find him or put out a search party,not that I can recall.A shark is seen trying to cause trouble,and attacks some people before it is captured.They put it on display,thinking they've stopped the attacks.But while the guy and girl are being lovey dovey and yaking,they forget to rehabilitate animal.The shark isn't used to being in a tank,so it starts to suffocate.Despite their attempts to save it,it turns over and drowns in front of a group of tourists.This was so stupid of them.If something like that happened in real life,the big cheeses at SW would've had their jobs.They soon discover that the shark that they had in captivity was a baby,and the mother is really mad they took it.A few days later,a badly decaying body swings side to side in front of a window,where tourists look at various wild, sea creatures.Upon examination of the decaying corpse,they discover the shark is twice the size of the one they caught.They assume it was the little shark's mother.They assume this from the way the skin and muscle was ripped cleanly off the front half of the body.First of all,how do you know that the killer shark is the mother,and not the big brother or sister?Second,if that had been a real decaying corpse,it would've been picked clean by scavengers; like crabs for instance.Third,the body would've been swept out to sea,and would've turned up on shore many months later.And the huge gaping wound doesn't even look right at all,it looks like something sawed off the flesh and muscle.Was the corpse/mannequin stolen from the set of Texas Chainsaw massacre 2 or 3?And since when did a mother shark ever cared for its baby?The shark pups are on their own after they're born.Did they get their information from a 4 year old?What a waste of film.The characters are never fully developed,so we don't have a reason to really care about them.The 3-D effects without the special glasses,look cheaply done.The scene where it is crashing through a large TV monitor,makes it look like a large, rubber shark head that smashes through;and stands still.It just looks so obvious that the shark is fake,and someone had tossed the glass right beside it.Not worth my time I wasted on this stupidity.Watch it for only the scene with the water skiers doing the pyramid,and the shark going after them.That,and the scene where the people get scared of the monstrosity, trying to ram shatter proof glass in a restaurant.",

            "content": "Given the incredible success of the first Jaws movie, and make no mistake it remains a stone cold classic to this day, it isn't all that much of a shock that 3 sequels followed, though the time between them is. Jaws 2, a thoroughly watchable sequel in its own right, hit in 1978, 4 years after Spielberg's original, and it would be a further 5 years before we got the next instalment of Brody Vs. Shark. Right in the midst of the 80s 3D boom no less.The film now follows the adult Mike Brody (Dennis Quaid) an underwater engineer helping prepare a new Sea World theme park with his dolphin training significant other Kay (Bess Armstrong). This is no ordinary Sea World though, under the guidance of manager Calvin Bouchard (Louis Gossett Jr.) they are launching a revolutionary new feature called 'The Undersea Kingdom' a giant man-made lagoon connected to the sea through a series of tunnels that features a host of attractions and restaurants 40ft below the surface.Mike's kid brother Sean (John Putch) comes to visit for the opening, which also features an appearance from Tv personality and big game hunter Philip FitzRoyce (Simon MacCorkindale) however it soon turns out there is another special guest, of the Great White variety, who snuck into the lagoon during maintenance of the gate separating the lagoon from the Ocean. Soon this shark is captured and Bouchard wants it on display. The hastily constructed exhibit proves insufficient and the shark dies. However, as soon the park opens and the lagoon filtration pipes are opened it becomes clear another Great White is stuck in the lagoon, and this one is bigger, and a whole lot angrier...Much maligned by...well, pretty much everyone, I've got to give Jaws 3 credit where it's due and state that I actually really quite like the base idea behind it. The plot of a theme park gone awry with deadly consequences may have already been done in Westworld, but mixing it with the Jaws my this isn't the worst idea ever, and Jaws 3's more traditional theme park setting isn't all that far removed from one of original Jaws' director Steven Spielberg's later movies, one you might have heard of called Jurassic Park.While the 2 brothers heading up the cast are allegedly the Brody boys, a few throwaway lines about being afraid of water and shark attacks aside, they really could be entirely new characters, come to think of it, Sean could quite easily be dropped from the plot without too much hassle. Both seem entirely unperturbed ANOTHER giant shark, even bigger than before, is stalking them...this time in an entirely different state. Calvin Bouchard is the spiritual successor to Mayor Vaughn who isn't a bad guy, but refuses to shut the beach/park in the name of greed. He may be a supporting character but for me the most interestingly written character in the film is FitzRoyce. When introduced, he comes across as an arrogant, big headed camera chaser, but at times his character comes across as genuinely passionate about the animals he films. He also deserves a does of credit for being almost a proto-Steve Irwin style character.Sadly he's in a minority, with the film really squandering its promise with a selection of ultimately bland characters. Brody name aside and Mike is just generic hero #5746. Arguably the film's most successful leads are Sindy and Sandy, the 2 trained dolphins who occasionally crop up to foil the shark's plans.What further passes up the promise of the plot is the complete lack of tension the film generates. Very rarely are any of the characters we care, well are expected to care, about placed in any immediate danger, and even when masses are trapped in the underwater tunnels the film never really succeeds in building any suspense around them. The shark attack scenes are so poorly conceived and filmed that they manage to render the film's main appeal worthless.One of the main reasons behind this are the special effects, or perhaps that should just be 'effects'. Now, as I mentioned, along with a lot of contemporary 80s shockers, Jaws 3 was originally conceived as Jaws 3D, and as such a lot of scenes were filmed to take advantage of this, well, gimmick. Now Jaws 3 isn't the only movie I've seen where the transition from 3D to 2D is obvious (Friday The 13th Part 3D springs to mind) this usually just entails a few scenes where something rather unnecessarily flies our towards the viewer. Jaws 3 is the only movie I've ever seen where these effects have looked so awful, both in terms of the props themselves AND how poorly they match the background. What doesn't help is that the undersea shots, which appear to be done with miniatures, look like something out of Gerry Anderson's puppet show Stingray.Indeed, and this deserves its own paragraph, this movie includes one of the single worst special effects I've ever seen. Now I love a movie that is so bad it is funny, but I think this is a term that is overused. Jaws 3 has a sequence that kills me every time, when a completely stationary shark model flies out of the screen from one of the aforementioned Stingray sets, into re screen and through a glass window, as Quaid, Gosset Jr & company react in slow motion. It's almost worth watching for this scene alone.As well as a good premise, the film as squanders a perfectly able cast, which also includes Lea Thomson in a small role as Sean's love interest. I couldn't accuse Quaid or Gosset Jr of phoning it in, because they both seem to be trying, but they're given no help whatsoever from the script.Likewise the film's score is serviceable, of course John Williams iconic theme is used, but Alan Parker's other tracks are of a solid calibre.Overall, Jaws 3 is really quite bad, especially when compared to the solid second entry, and when you take into account the talent involved. At the same time, it isn't totally unwatchable, and the talent involved do escalate it above a lot of the poorer 'killer sea creature' movies that followed in Jaws wake. On one final note, I've always been somewhat surprised Universal set this in Seaworld, and didn't fabricate their own aquatic based theme park.",

They could have at least drafted a few true SOUTHerners with real SOUTHern accents for those tiny parts. In addition, Louis Gossett Jr. was not a good choice for this movie. I have never seen him in anything where he was a good choice due to his horrible acting skills.I would also have preferred to leave the 3-D gimmick out of the movie since it only adds to the already low-quality cinematography. It definitely does not add anything worthwhile to the movie and is very cheesy at best.All in all, I would recommend watching this movie if you liked Jaws and Jaws 2, to keep up with the Jaws family.

The Extraterrestrial\" the previous year, decide to milk yet another Spielberg property: the big rubber shark, trying to cash with the short lived 3D movie trend of the early 80s, in attempt to distract the audience at looking at the screen for the 3D effects and trying to ignore the shoddy movie.Originally planned as a comedic turn for the franchise (the original screenplay was titled \"Jaws 3 People 0\" go figure) but it was scrapped at the last moment but somehow they managed to turn it in an unintentional comedy anyway, full of ridiculous situations and stupid characters. It feels more like a actual parody, a la \"Airplane\", of the previous \"Jaws\" movies and their countless imitators that you keep waiting for Leslie Nielsen to appear. We follow the two sons of Chief Brody, who somehow managed to become full grown up men only in a few years, both ended in Florida working in Miami's Sea World and thanks to a plot contrivance stolen from \"Orca\" (already a clone from the original \"Jaws\") they meet again with the now female shark, all rusty and wear out.

It introduced me to my fav actress of all time...Lea Thompson I fell for her the second I saw her fall into the water in the first 30 seconds of the masterpiece. The best part was her in her tiny blue bikini. Thats it! Its a shame that she was not in 3D!",

I love the original Jaws, It's at the pinnacle of suspense and horror, and even the sequel, Jaws 2, provides good entertainment.Whether a third instalment was required or not, despite obvious clich\u00e9s, it could have worked. With this one they tried to give it a new spin by making it 3-D. Unfortunately, this completely works against it as the effects are awful.And without decent shark effects, the movie has taken a massive nose-dive already. But coupled in with an utterly uninteresting script, awful characters and lack of suspense and scares, it fails on every level.Avoid like the plague, even Revenge (The hideous sequel) is more passable IMO.",

Of course, when it comes to horror movies you aren't that surprised when they do follow-up after follow-up. But if they could make a good one for once, I would be more than happy to buy it. But yet another time, they make a follow-up that bites the dust.The storyline itself isn't that bad, but they could have tried a lot harder to make it seem more realistic when they put it together with the landscapes and surroundings in the film. (Believe me, I've seen worse!)The actors are actually O.K. for this kind of movie. In horror films such as this they usually act so bad that you wonder how they got their role in the first place. But here, they actually do their job pretty well and I don't have any real complains!Now to the star of the movie, the shark. You might expect it to look as real as \"Bruce\" in the first movie, but that was thanks to Steven Spielberg being the director. Here, it looks like something you would do for a project in elementary school! I could count all the mistakes they did with the Great White in this film, but here's my biggest complains:Why would a shark attack a sunken ship with its mouth wide open?, the dolphins are a little too smart and worst of all: The effects are terrible!But on the plus side you will at least walk away from this truly awful film with a good laugh, thanks to the not-so scary effects!",

Whilst the acting was so so, the suspense was incredible and nearly rivalled other popular 80's sci fi movies such as ALIENS, that I rank as the best suspense that I have ever witnessed on film.I thought It was a huge jump ahead from the second movie and although the first is a classic.. If I am honest with myself, I think I enjoyed this more than the first one. Though incomparable and very different style. It could be my taste because JAWS 3 was a kinda movie and I don't think that the plot wasn't plausible at all, I think it a very realistic scenario.I think even as a kid I like this one the most and as an adult, it seems that I haven't changed my mind.",

            "content": "Seeing Jaws 3-D makes me wonder if I was too harsh on Jaws 2. I recently reviewed Jaws 2 and criticized its sloppy and poor storytelling and pacing, but nonetheless thought it had moments of good film-making, especially in its action set-pieces - so you had a decent, albeit not exceptional movie. Well, the third Jaws movie makes Jaws 2 look like Jaws. Jaws 3-D is a movie that, to my astonishment, makes me feel nothing. Well almost nothing. The only emotion that stirred inside me during its entire one hour and forty minutes... was embarrassment for this \"amateur hour.\" I was mildly interested in seeing the movie because it seemed to be the last Jaws movie with the crew of the previous movies working on it. Longtime Spielberg production designer Joe Alves directed, as he was a second unit director on the previous movies and played a part in getting them to look good. Jaws 3-D was also the last Jaws screenplay penned by Carl Gottlieb. Gottlieb, who contributed to the screenplay of Jaws and largely wrote Jaws 2, had shown some competency in staging suspenseful scenes and allowing moments for characters to breathe and develop. I am not sure if they were under strain from studio executives, but it is clear watching Jaws 3-D why Alves never directed again, and why Gottlieb's writing career more or less fizzled out after this movie. Characters, such as the two Brody sons, have little character and less to do. There's no meaningful exchanges between the brothers or other Sea World workers, or the park owner (an enjoyably slimy performance by Lou Gosset), or the Australian... hunter? photographer? Even Jaws 2 managed to have moments where people acted (even if that was rare). Here everyone goes through the motions. Dennis Quaid gets his paycheck. Sean Brody, played indistinctly by John Putch, has a... uh, character arc where he's afraid of the water, but gets over it because a hot chick offers to bang him by the beach. I guess that's character development. But he leaves the movie two-thirds of the way through, severing one more connection with the series' cast and history that we have grown attached to. Now, I am always for movies, especially genre/franchise flicks bucking convention and cleverly moving past their forebears, but without good writing or characters, all those efforts are worthless. Jaws 2 didn't have a particularly strong script, so it leaned on the setting of Amity Island, and some familiar faces to make up the deficit. Jaws 3-D thought it could lean on the setting of Sea World and the presence of other sea creatures like dolphins, orca, and the like. The outcome is a total dud, and cynical misjudge of what will keep the audience engaged. The setting is totally wasted - see Deep Blue Sea to see a film that at least tries to take advantage of its location in an underwater observatory. Making an amusement park the site of widespread bloodshed and chaos has immediate potential (see: Jurassic Park), but Universal did not seem to want to spend the money fleshing the premise out, so what is left is a real cheap production: extending from the sets all the way to the marquis attraction - the shark itself.The shark has never looked so bad. Jaws 2 showed off a shark that was in some ways superior to the original, and the resultant construction allowed for some inventive and fun action scenes from the director and crew. In Jaws 3-D the shark was stiff, mostly motionless, and seemed to have consisted of a single model that was capable of opening its mouth and wiggling a little bit. The action scenes were mundane and executed in a dull manner and lacked the dynamic camera movements and smart cuts of the previous movie. Instead, we have \"fin chases something in the water\" scenes, mixed with some laughable \"shark-torpedo\" moments where the shark slowly inches towards something to attack. The film's other effects are likewise poor. The optical shots and overlays were so so shoddy that you wonder how anyone signed off on them, other than slimy producers looking for a quick buck. They say that while making Jaws Spielberg called the SFX crew the \"special defects department.\" He had no clue how good he had it. Here's a rule for creature movies. If you can't show the monster all the time, at least have a good writing/actors. If you can't have good writing/characters, than at least keep the thing short and moving so my time isn't wasted. Jaws 3-D wastes your time and feels longer than its 1hr40min length because it lacks a good monster, good performances or writing, and has a terminally slow pace riddled with filler. Jaws 2 had me pining for more shark scenes. When compared to Jaws 3-D, Jaws 2 feels like non-stop shark tail slapping you in your groin. The movie tries to pull of some cheap jump-scares and gross-outs, but the make-up and special effects are c-movie grade and incredibly silly. Worse still, they are spread out so far and few that they are less like exclamation points than they are a dull rapping on the TV screen to make sure you are still awake. Is there anything positive about Jaws 3-D? Surprisingly, yes! The music, composed by Alan Parker is fun, adventurous, and well-suited to the action. While leaning on the score of John Williams, it nonetheless manages to achieve its own sound and feels fresh and enjoyable. Mr. Parker deserves a commendation for doing the best he could with a bad source. It's a shame he seemed to retreat largely into made-for-TV movies after this, never getting a huge Hollywood movie to sink his teeth into again.In summation: this movie definitely feels like the death-knell for this \"franchise.\" There wasn't even enough happening to offer a \"so bad it's good\" experience! Despite having a few of the original hands working on it, the movie demonstrated that they lacked the skill, the time, or the artistic freedom to bring about something worthwhile. I'll give it to the crew of Jaws 2: they tried to make a good movie, they just didn't really succeed. The makers of Jaws 3-D didn't even try!",

So if I told you this film is about a killer fish, you wouldn't look at me like I'm some kind of wacko, right?Basically, a bunch of people put a shark in an aquarium. Now, before I watched this film I often wondered to myself, \"Why don't they put great white sharks in aquariums?\" After watching 'Jaws 3' I knew the answer. It's not because they die in captivity, it's because they always end up escaping and lots of people die. Oh, did I say lots? Because hardly anyone dies.'Jaws 3''s effects are, to put it bluntly, crappy. The film was originally presented in 3-D, which means you have several shots in which the shark model begins to move towards you on the screen. Now, effective this MIGHT have been in 3-D, watched on a normal television the whole thing looks hilarious. You have this completely UNMOVING model increasing in size on the screen and it's about as scary as 'Book of Shadows'. Ie not very.So should you watch 'Jaws 3'? Well, if you want a case study for the deteriorating effects sequels have, then by all means. If you want a decent film, steer clear. The acting is forgettable, the effects moreso. This is not a good B-Movie. A good B-Movie is 'Tremors'. 'Jaws 3' is to 'good movies' what 'Joss Whedon' is to 'talented.' Three out of ten.",

SeaWorld is something entirely different from Amity island. However they don't take advantage of this location at all. There is no build up, suspense or tension in this film. It still feels like a generic monster movie like Jaws 2. It doesn't help that the leads are just wooden blocks. At least the second debacle had Roy Schneider to make it watchable. The leads here are just dry in comparison.This films is literal cinematic junk food, while Speilberg's summer blockbuster was a cinematic masterpiece. The effects are so laughable. Especially the scene where the shark breaks through the glass window underwater and everyone screams \"Shaaark\" in slow-motion. The whole sequence is just abysmal.It is truly sad what jaws is coming to. It grows cheaper and worse each movie. Still, part 4 makes this movie look like the original Jaws.",

After seeing the second one, I was a little disappointed, but I still enjoyed better than other films I'd seen.      Then I saw this movie-if you want to call it that. What I would call this piece of garbage is a waste of film and a major waste of a good idea. \"Deep Blue Sea\" illustrates the idea of sharks attacking an underwater facility much better than \"Jaws 3\"-and I hated Deep Blue Sea anyway.     Here's what happens. A huge theme park is about to open, and its main attraction is an \"undersea kingdom\" where people go to see fish and reefs (Like we've never heard that before). Soon, though, the doors to the undersea kingdom are mysteriously opened, and guess what happens to be in the area and swim inside? A harmless little sea otter? No. A shark! Soon afterward (after skipping sensual activity involving mike and shawn brody with their girlfriends) the shark is killing everybody in sight, but then mike's girl decides to capture the thing and keep it in captivity. Sounds great, huh? NOT! Soon, the shark somehow dies (go figure) and then before we're aware of anything else, another one (the first shark's mother) is attacking the undersea kingdom and destroying everything!     There are three major things that I thought could have made this movie much better: the story, the characters, and the shark itself. The story was amazingly lame. It doesn't even take us back to Amity, and that was the highlight of the first two films. Even though it was probably a good idea to change the story and not just keep having the same plot over and over and over that the shark comes in, kills people, then Martin Brody (who was mysteriously absent from this film) destroys it, they shouldn't have started a whole new setting with new characters. And that leads me into the second part: the characters. The first film had three stars playing great roles: Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, and Roy Scheider as Quint, Hooper and Brody. As the second Jaws came about, only Scheider returned in the trio of great actors. And by the third movie he was gone. The only good actor in this movie was Dennis Quaid as Mike Brody. Tchh...and the last part was the rubber-I mean great white shark. But seriously, it looked so stupid I couldn't believe it. The bad shark in the first Jaws was ok, because they didn't have the special effects that we do today. But eight years later, technology had improved, but they still only used the same shark robot. Horrible. My lowest recommendations * out of *****.",

Well, it was worse than I ever could have anticipated and it was funny, but not even funny enough to keep me watching til the end.Why this was ever made into a film is beyond me. It should have been abandoned when it was a mere concept. Alas, time and money were put into making it and now poor suckers like me will waste their time and money on watching it. The story-line is moronic at the best of times. It seems strange to me that a supposedly brand-new, technologically advanced water-park would have such weak, rusty fences, prone to breaking and letting in Great White Sharks of monstrous proportions. And why are the Brody kids involved? It's implausible to the extreme to suggest that a third shark would follow members of one family all around in order to seek revenge for dead sharks it is unlikely to have come across. Considering the poor story, I'm surprised the shark didn't follow the family into the middle of the desert. And Florida? Really, Greak White's prefer cooler waters!And when the Shark gets stuck in the vents to the underwater lagoon, how does it survive in knee-deep water with the oxygen cut off for about 10 minutes? Even surviving long enough to kill a man (who also had his vital supply of oxygen cut off for 10 minutes) and manage to smash through the metal? I wonder.The shark attack scenes, well they were terrible. In an attempt to look more realistic they've gone with doco-style shots of a real shark (much smaller than the one supposedly in the park) sped up so that the shark's natural movements make it look more like it's having a seizure than attacking. And to be honest, I couldn't see half of what was going on anyway because of how dark it all was. Some parts of the movie were spent with me watching a black screen and trying to piece together what was going on through the poor dialogue. Needless to say, I could hardly keep up and I'm not sure whether that was due to the constantly changing story-line or the fact that I couldn't see anything. I could go on and on about how crap this movie was and how much I don't recommend it, (even as a bit of a laugh) but frankly, I think I've wasted enough time on this movie.",

Sharks don't have bonds, sharks are cold and emotionless, they don't take mates, and they don't care for their children a whole awful lot, they are just brainless instinctual fish, that must keep moving or they will die, this is why the geniuses in the movie put the baby in a cramped little tank, and shocked it shitless with a whole crowd of gawking people. Now this movie is very pointless, and very bad, and the way they kill the shark is pathetic, it can't swallow a guy whole for some reason when it can all those other times, and somehow he doesn't let go of his grenade, and they are able to pull the pin, I mean it just sounds utterly ridiculous. This film is horrifying and stupid in every single way, and I want to never defile my eyes by viewing it again, oh wait I just did, and saw that they used the shark theme, but still.......",

Cinephiles holding it up to the standard of Spielberg's film are missing the point: this is a popcorn munching thriller that shouldn't be taken too seriously. Perhaps best of all, it genuinely builds a head of dramatic momentum - climaxing in an outrageously fun death scene for Jaws. It's big. It's silly.

The Jaws series has been the benchmark for this rule, and this one if no exception. Carl Gottlieb, the skilled co-writer of Spielberg's classic (and incidentally my favourite film of all time)must have written this on a 20 minute train journey. The plot and the setting make absoultely NO sense whatsoever, why is the name of all that is holy, have an aquarium IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEA? Isn't that 1)not possible and 2)ridiculous? The cast, which in closer examination are really rather accomplished (Dennis Quaid, Louis Gossett Jr) clearly seem to be under the impression that the film they are making is a bit nifty, but it is obvious that Joe Alves, the director, did not show them dailies of the effects shots. The 3D gimmick seems to have been cooked up one night over  beer and pretzels at Universal Studios, and Alves clearly has no idea what to do with it. Lingering shots of coral, pointy objects and fish heads fill the screen and show 3D for what it truly is. Rubbish. The worst idea that the film employs is making the shark 3D too, turning it from a lean mean killing machine into a floating, etheral blue turd. Alves tries his best with what he has been given, but ulitmately fails to deliver the goods required. Dennis Quaid should thank his lucky stars he came out of this one unscathed.

This one is in a whole different environment... Sea World. People are saying this plot is ridiculous except it's really not because having a live great white shark in captivity is every aquarium's dream. Sure the shark bashes through steel mechanized gates but is that really such a far leap from pulling apart an entire pier or pulling down those yellow barrels like the shark did in the first movie? Unfortunately everything positive I could say about this movie stops there.While the look of the mechanical shark improves with each sequel this one did a terrible job at showing it properly. Also there's a scene where the baby great white is attacking a sunken ship to try getting to some people but it's clearly a guy ramming a toy shark into a miniature ship prop. The baby also hardly ever moves its tail for some reason so it looks like its just drifting in the water. The effects have their moments but they're mostly cheesy and laughable.The acting is uninspired and none of the characters are really memorable. There were times where I was like \"oh yeah... THAT guy exists...\"Every time I saw the shark fin rise to the surface and heard that iconic music playing it felt like the director was just saying \"Oh! I get to make a JAWS movie! That means we need lots of these shots!\" There was no tension to those shots like there was in JAWS and even a little in JAWS 2.It's bad but I've seen worse.

            "content": "*SPOILERS*A review of Jaws 3 minus the stigma of the -'D' attached to it's name. Do yourself a favor and forget about the tacky 3D effects that were intended for the theater, to be viewed on a huge screen, no less, in 1983.While admittedly not as good as part II, and most certainly nowhere near the level of the original Jaws (one of my all time favorites and among the best films ever made) - still, at least to me, Jaws 3 delivers in many areas. If you find yourself even somewhat agreeing with what I'm saying, why not continue reading and hear me out?Being a writer and having never actually seen this third installment until recently, I have to say, I was impressed with many aspects of it. From the story, to the pacing, the great sets and locations, and to the on-par acting performances. A young Dennis Quaid certainly performed well and met my expectations, as did the others. I enjoyed watching the grown up versions of the Brody boys; Michael and Sean. As if inheriting 'the Brody curse' from their father, the boys must hold up the certainly unwanted family legacy of dealing with rogue great whites. Although Mike has more or less recovered from the trauma, Sean, being the younger brother, has not.I have to admit, some of the scenes did actually freak me out, and they still do with further viewings. While nothing can compare with Quint being eaten alive in the first Jaws - or his amazing monologue about the Indianapolis - the scene in Jaws 3 where one of the characters is still alive inside of a 35 foot shark's mouth, desperately evading its chomping teeth, was near traumatizing for me. Partly because of that *CRUNCH* of crushed bone, but mostly due to my fear of sharks in general. But I can't let that stop me from enjoying a decent movie - which is just what Jaws 3 is - a decent movie if you can look past its graphical shortcomings. Besides, when you see the shots of the sharks that aren't in 3D, they're fine.One other thing I have to mention, is the level of tension I felt when the tourist group is escorted out of the facility through the underwater glass tunnel. My exact thought was: \"Uh oh...holy crap...\". And I love the first film, but the 35 foot mama shark in Jaws 3, about the size of a juvenile Megalodon, could eat the original 25 footer for supper.I even liked the cheesy ending. Say what you will about that, but I was relieved when both dolphins made it, because I thought for certain that one had not. And why shouldn't they cheer and celebrate considering what they just went through and lived. I know I would if I battled a shark for my life and finally succeeded in blowing it up by pulling the pin of a grenade stuck in its mouth, still held firmly in the hand of the last man who had been eaten. I'd be sad for my fallen comrades later, though, you can count on that. Probably about thirty seconds later...What I can't seem to figure out is why people try so very hard to negatively over-analyze and compare sequels to legendary originals, forming their decision on whether or not said sequel has something of creative value solely on the basis that if does not live up to the original, it is then deemed to be a terrible film that possesses no quality worth mentioning. I find myself in complete disagreement and disgust with that sort of excessiveness that pervades the internet, both as a creative writer and as a lifelong viewer of television and movies. You see, these are the people that egotistically and falsely believe that given the chance to write, direct, and star in a movie, it would absolutely turn out better than whatever movie it is they're currently dumping on. Now I'm not suggesting that you can't have an opinion - an opinion that could certainly be valid - but might I suggest that you look for what IS good rather than focusing purely on, in the case of Jaws 3's 3-D effects, what obviously isn't good.At this point in the review, I feel, if only to demonstrate that I'm not completely crazy in my liking of what I know is an underrated movie, that it might help to list a few other various films I enjoy: Fight Club, No Country For Old Men, The Men Who Stare At Goats, The Matrix, The Shawshank Redemption, The Last Samurai, The Green Mile, Before Sunrise/Sunset/Midnight, Lost In Translation, Predator 1 & 2, The Terminator, T2 Judgement Day, and many many more, including older gems like Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window - all of which I often add to a playlist that runs all night as I write. If you're a writer like me, you probably draw inspiration from wherever you're lucky enough to find it. I can't say that I was inspired by this movie, but it did enough for me to deserve a subtle nod.IMDb members have collectively given Jaws 3 a 3.6 rating. In factoring out the terrible 3-D effects, I'd rate it a 6.0, with Jaws 2 a 6.5, and the original a solid 8.5 - a half point higher than its current 8.0 rating.It would be amazing if all the bad 3D effects could be re-done so that Jaws 3 could be re-released in higher quality - or like in the case of fan edits of Star Wars - de-specialize the hell out of it into a more easily digestible version for the people who can't easily look past the film's most major flaw. It could even do for a total remake.On a side note, I can't wait until next year's MEG, set to release in early March 2018.",

Note the meteoric increase in the usage of 3-D in theme parks.  \"Jaws 3-D,\" while not the best 3-D presentation, was an amazing sight to behold theatrically as every object imaginable, from viscera to killer whales, was thrust at the audience in widescreen.  Youngsters in the audience even tried to push away an approaching fish-head and inadvertently hit the patrons in front of them. The impact of \"Jaws 3-D\" has been greatly diminished by home video and the film's strengths are all but lost as the 3-D cinematography has been converted for regular viewing and cropped to fit the TV screen.  All that remains is the worst aspects of the film and \"Jaws 3-D\" is indeed horrible. A hideous mix of appalling dialogue, torturous music, and garish special-effects that would not appear even remotely real to a toddler. Yet, the film is a triumph.  A trash masterwork of misguided imagination, heedless financing, and erroneous melodrama.  If a film could ever be obnoxiously over-the-top and enjoyable for just that reason, \"Jaws 3-D\" is that film!  The film's entire premise is shockingly weak, unbelievable and laughable.  The music is pretentious and annoyingly repetitive, with the same basic theme duplicated throughout the entire film with little or no alteration.  The special-effects are flamboyant, fake, and insanely inconsistent.  The shark changes size whenever it's convenient for the filmmakers, varying from a plausible size of 20-feet to a ridiculous size of 35-feet.  The shark is extremely slow moving, growls, and has a large fleshy appendage in its mouth that appears to be a tongue. All this despite the fact that sharks don't have vocal cords or tongues.  In the film, a character somehow eludes the shark's oversized plastic teeth and is subsequently pulsated to death with the tongue.  We see this scene alongside the victim from inside the shark's mouth while the soundtrack plays a strange cacophony of music, crunching noises, intestinal bellows and what sounds like moans of orgasm.  If this moronic scene sounds tolerable, \"Jaws 3-D\" is a film to be enjoyed.  A film filled with many more inane, crass visual gags optimized by the 3-D medium, such as floating severed extremities, spear-guns, hypodermic needles, or mechanical eels.  The dialogue - whether uttered by white-trash or first-class performers such as Louis Gossett Jr. or Bess Armstrong - is always painful and most of the actors deserve better.  The film does however, pull out all the stops for an impossible finale that is not only the most competent scene in the film but also, dare I say, inspired.  \"Jaws 3-D\" is pure kitsch, a howlingly bad 98 minutes of absurd action sequences, shoddy special-effects and tawdry scenery.  If the preceding sentence exemplifies all that you enjoy about trash cinema, then by all means see \"Jaws 3-D!\"",

It was fun to see the shark leaping out of the water and towards the audience, but beyond the gimmick, the movie lacked substance.\n\nSecondly, the acting was mediocre at best, with some cheesy lines and over-the-top reactions. While it was enjoyable to see Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr. on screen, their performances didn't quite save the movie.\n\nLastly, the plot was predictable and lacked depth. It was essentially just another shark attack movie, and the characters didn't have much development. While it was a decent watch for a lazy weekend, it wasn't particularly memorable or impactful.\n\nOverall, Jaws 3D was a decent movie that relied too heavily on 3D effects and didn't offer much else. It's worth a watch for fans of the Jaws franchise, but don't expect too much from it.",

Mix this in with boring uninspired basic shots and you get a bad combination overall. The music is ok and probably the best thing in this. The Jaws theme works but the rest is forgettable and generic. The editing is bad with no real flow at times of story and gives way to terrible pacing. The first 30 minutes are incredibly boring followed by a semi interesting shark capture and plot twist that makes no sense and a laughably bad ending shot with subpar scenes in between. Because of this its very hard to ever build any suspense and sustain it and makes for a very boring picture that you laugh at at times for how bad it gets towards the end. This isn't worth it at all.

Even the second film was better, and while I would hardly call that film a masterpiece, it was watchable.\n\nOne major problem with this film is that it's dull, in my opinion that is. I wouldn't have minded so much the sluggish pace if the suspense and plot were up to par. Sadly, neither are. The plot is both unoriginal and close to being a non-event.\n\nThe suspense, tension and thrills were what made the original so memorable, there is next to none of that here. The music and direction do not help. The music feels very predictably placed sometimes which spoils the mood of the scene, and the direction feels pedestrian and tired.\n\nThe locations are pretty good, they're not what makes the film so dull and cheap visually. That's the fault of the slip-shod editing and the rubbish effects, with the shark completely lacking menace and feeling incredibly gimmicky. Jaws 3-D also has some cheesy and trite dialogue and superficial characters that you don't care for at all.\n\nThe acting is poor. Dennis Quaid has a badly-written character, and sadly in his performance he lets that show. The other actors are either bland or annoying.\n\nSo overall, while not as bad as Revenge the film is a big mess. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

I will say I didn't enjoy the plot, but only because it lacked something worth watching - it's poor, not terrible. More of the shark was wanted, but I would personally say that about the preceding two films as well.\n\nParts of this 1983 flick that are terrible, though, are the special effects, especially right at the end. There is also some poorly done green screen and it, clearly, has a dire cover. There's no doubting this being made was a cash grab, that's basically the only reason to ever go 3-D, but a cash grab doesn't necessarily mean it's an awful film; which this isn't, in my opinion.

As for the ending scene where the shark breaks the glass, is without a doubt the worst scene in movie history. First of all, the shark in that scene looked like someone googled up a photo of a shark and edited it into the final cut. Also, when the shark brakes the glass shouldn't it have gotten pulled into the room with the other people, and not have just disappeared! On top all that, this was meant to be the climax of the movie! Truly nothing could truly be farther from a satisfying ending that could've made up for the horrible cinematography and poorly rendered CG that was the whole movie. Overall, I would like to hear from anyone who thinks this is even a slightly good movie because it deserves every bit of criticism that it got. You can't even take the trailer let alone the whole movie even slightly seriously and in my opinion is a truly dreadful 0/10 film!",

You barely even see the shark. And the end of the shark which were epic in the first movies was awful in this one. Logic is thrown out the window for this movie. THE SHARK SWIMS BACKWARDS!!!! If you didn't know sharks can't do that. And the shark is thirty feet long. And Apparently doesn't eat people just kills them because we see two dead bodies one a day after the shark attack one STILL IN THE SHARK'S MOUTH. And the one in the shark's moth is there even after another person is eaten. It's so bad! Also right before the main shark attack and death scene the main characters run into the shark and are rescued by dolphins without the trainer calling them. They just swam over where a deadly shark is and saved some humans. WHAT? Sorry I keep using all caps this movie is garbage. The characters aren't bad and the acting is fine I guess. The one good thing I can say about this movie is that it tried to do something different. But man did it blow it. Don't waste your time with this. It's so bad it goes past the point of it's so bad it's good. Because there is nothing good about this movie. If you're curious and want to laugh at the bad special effects, don't.

Now, you have to consider this has been decades since it was first released. You also have to give credit due to Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong for making a likable pair. It was a good idea for having the shark based in Sea World. The only problem is it was Joe Alves first movie, and given that it was in 3-D. Not so well...most of the shots look dark. They can be creepy but a little hard to tell what's going on. The shark looked the best I think, giving that it had rows of teeth and you can see it from the inside of the sharks jaws.  Even whites of her eyes. But I think this movie flounders with the aspect of it. They showcase the 3-D, \"way...too...much.\" The dialogue doesn't make sense unless you have subtitles on. About the time the shark gets going, we've already spent forty-eight minutes waiting on it. Not really any attacks, but I think that was a good thing. It made the shark kind of pick and choose who to do next. From there on, it's a decent follow up. It was decidedly good, until it rammed the undersea lab. Not sure if they didn't have money or what, but both that and a couple effects weren't that well handled. I've read the script, and they cut about fifteen minutes out of it. It made it more dialogue heavy, but Hollywood always goes for the budget constraints of more people in the seats with slimmer budgets.   It's not a terrible, awful, bad movie...it was just all over the place. ",

Well with Jaws 3 (3D on cinematic release in 1983) I had one of those moments.\nThe eighties were to result in several of these appalling films. (Grease 2, Superman IV, several Cannon films)\nThe premise is quite frankly laughable. \nYou have a water based 'Seaworld' theme park on the East Coast of the US.\nA Great White Shark enters the lagoon or man made lake of the park from the ocean via the gate that supposedly separates them.\nIt later becomes apparent that a second, far bigger shark (it's mother) is also at large in the park.\nCharacters include the grown up sons of Chief Brody from the first two Jaws films.\nThe park owner Calvin Bouchard (Louis Gossett Jr), Mike Brody (Dennis Quaid),  a marine biologist Dr. Kathryn Morgan (Bess Armstrong) and two British actors Simon MacKorcindale and P.H. Moriarty.\nDiscerning British viewers may recognise Moriarty from the likes of The Long Good Friday and Scum.\nMacKorcindale from the BBC TV drama Casualty.\nFor its cinema release the film was called Jaws 3D and required the viewer to wear some naff cardboard glasses.\nWhen watching the 2D version as I did it becomes apparent at certain points that objects come flying toward the camera for the 3D effects.\nThe special effects are poor by modern standards and add to the inadvertent comedy of a film that was released as a horror/suspense production.\nCertain scenes again made me laugh to myself at quite 'gory' moments such as characters being eaten showing their view inside the 35 foot mother sharks mouth.\nWhere as the direction of Steven Spielberg in the first film and it's music by John Williams were great highlights this film relies on a novice director Joe Alves who is out of his pardon the pun, depth.\nThe music being scored by Alan Parker with only elements of Williams Jaws theme.\nA film that with a better director and better script could have been so much better  (it can't be much worse?).",

This time, son of the Brody family Mike (Dennis Quaid) works for SeaWorld along with his marine biologist girlfriend Kay(Bess Armstrong).  His younger brother Sean pays a visit for continuity reasons from the first two films and he takes a liking to water skier Kelly (Lea Thompson).  Lou Gossett Jr joins the cast as the park's owner Calvin who has a bizarre Cajun/ Creole/ Caribbean (not sure) accent.  After a great white shark swims into the park's man made lagoon, a park employee gets eaten along with two coral poachers.  Mike and Kay investigate the disappearance of their coworker and discover a baby great white shark.  Instead of killing it, they decide to capture and keep it in captivity to boost park ticket sales.  The park opens and the baby shark dies.  Then the body of their missing coworker appears in front of some park guests in their undersea tunnels.  However, he seems to be attacked by something much larger than the baby shark.  It's 35 foot long mother who shows up right on queue to reek havoc on the park, terrorizing water skiers and park guests by trapping them in the undersea attraction.  Mike and Kay must now rescue the people trapped and kill the shark while Calvin ponders the huge lawsuits bound to follow this disaster.\nOriginally filmed and released in 3-D under the title \"Jaws 3D\" then changed to \"Jaws III\" for video and TV.  This film suffers from poor special effects, a paper thin plot and not enough shark mayhem.  If they would've focused more on reviving the disaster film genre from the 1970s then this entry in the series may have been fun.  Instead, it's slow, talky and what ever little action and suspense it does have is preposterous.  This shark can swim backwards, remain still in the water and even snarl even though sharks have no vocal chords.  If you think \"Jaws 2\" was a bit of a bore during the second and third acts, then you'll think this entry is even more sluggish.  Skip this film and just watch the original.",

In fact my 3 star rating would be reduced further were it not for it's kooky 3D effects which in of themseleves are far more entertaining than much else that the movie has to offer. \n\nThat said, it's almost unfair to call this movie bad when the movie was designed purely to serve the 3D rather than the other way around. The movie knows exactly what it is and never pretends to be anything else. In fact I'll be brave and say its not actually a bad movie when viewed in its intended form and taken as tongue-in-cheek as clearly intended.\n\nIn 2D though, it's a much flatter experience in every sense. For a start the badly composited process shots look much worse and completely lose their novelty factor. In 3D you actually look forward to seeing them!\n\nThe 3D is so dominant and the depth so amped up that you are never allowed to forget for one second that you're watching a 3D movie. Even ardent 3D fans may find it headache inducing eventually. The script is mostly forgettable but it does have its moments and generally the cast do okay to work with what they have.\n\nOne interesting thing to note is that most of the shark footage (except for a few strange looking bad processed shots) looks good. \n\nOverall, in its 3D form it's a fun B movie that goes well with a bag of popcorn, a couple of alcoholic drinks and a few friends.\n\nThe big achievement of the 3D version is it's ability to leave you with a guilty smirk on your face by the end.\n\n In 2D, it loses most of it's charm and any real reason for existing.\n\nThe third dimension in hilarity.",

Well almost 30 plus years later I recently saw it on Bluray in 3D, on a 60 inch TV. \n\nI enjoyed the movie, its a typical 80's cheesy movie. If the movie had been edited a little tighter it would actually be a good film. The reason the film is in my memory is because the directors sister used to be a secretary for my father, and from memory the director was on the run at the time for legal reasons. Anyway back to the movie, it does drag in places. However watching the in your face 3D is enjoyable and brings back childhood memories of just how great the 80's really were I need Doc Browns Time machine to just spend a few weeks there, and to get an opportunity to have the big hair and shoulder pads. Its basically Jurassic Park in the water, a theme park that goes wrong and people die, pretty simple really. Watch it and enjoy it for what it is good old plain cheesy fun.

Some other plus sides though, it was fun to see Mike and Sean Brody in this continuation on another frightful adventure as Mike is an employee at the park and Sean more afraid than ever of the water. The film is enjoyable enough in my opinion, but probably my least favorite out of the series.",

Making a second sequel and turning that standalone film into a franchise.  So it is with the \"Jaws\" franchise with the release of \"Jaws 3\".  And while some single films have found success in becoming franchises, the same cannot be said for \"Jaws\".  \"Jaws 2\" was a disappointment, but \"Jaws 3\" is a whole new level of bad.\n\nThe biggest problem with \"Jaws 3\" is that it takes place at Sea World.  As such, it is less about the shark, and more about the park.  There is one decent scene where the shark attacks a bunch of people at the Sea World opening day event.  Other than that, it goes long periods without a shark attack.  As a result, the film is also less about suspense and more about...well I don't know what.\n\nI think it speaks volumes about this film that its big gimmick was being in 3D, yet there are some truly awful visual effects.  It's a film that cannot deliver on its promises.  It's just one of many problems that \"Jaws 3\" has.  Even the things it does well - like the twist that there are two sharks - are ruined because they end up not being utilized well.  \"Jaws 3\" is just a really boring film; one lacking the fun and suspense of the original \"Jaws\".",

No actors from the previous films were cast. The film was released in 3D, but the unlike its predecessors the critics did not like it. I, on the other hand, was able to enjoy it. Agreed, the storyline is not that complicated and it does take long before we get to see the shark in action, but I do like the fact that it takes place in a sea-world theme park. And yes, the special effects are a bit cheesy. A good suggestion for a night of brainless entertainment.  \n\nMichael Brody (Quaid) works with his girlfriend Kathryn in Florida's Sea-World. When Michael's younger brother Sean comes on a visit, they plan to have a good time together. But when a man is found dead in the water, half eaten, they recognize the wounds as shark bites. A great white shark has made its way into the lagoon. With the help of famous TV hunter Philip FitzRoyce (MacCorkindale), the people of Sea-World are able to capture the animal, wanting it to exhibit it. The shark dies shortly afterwards. Kathryn and Michael are shocked when the learn that it was only a baby. Its mother must be nearby. And then Sea-World colors red as the gigantic monsters appears. Can they stop momma shark?",

Most of the people who have seen this movie have only seen it on home video and not in 3D, so the film winds up being an exercise in trying not to laugh your butt off at how bad it is. This time around, the film takes place at Seaworld, where a shark accidentally gets in and reeks havoc. Mike and Sean Brody are conveniently present for all of the shark's shenanigans and don't contribute a whole lot to the plot anyways. It's all about the 3D and the images jumping out of the screen at the audience to sell the gimmick. It's a shame too because it could have at least been on par with the previous sequel if they had just not gone with the 3D. All of that said, this film is indeed hilarious. The special effects and the 3D parts don't hold up and are laugh out loud funny, as is Louis Gossett Jr.'s terrible delivery of the dialogue. Actually, hardly anybody in this film delivers dialogue that's worth listening to, but that adds to the charm, so watch it to make fun of it only. Does it tarnish the Jaws legacy? No, but it's a terrible movie, but under the right cirumstances, you can have some fun with it.",

Looking at the writing credits you'd think the film had potential, with \"Jaws\" original screenwriter \"Carl Gottlieb\" and the brilliant Richard Matheson. However, the film is a mess, involving a great white shark eating people at Sea World. There's no real suspense, a complete lack of interesting characters, and just abysmal special effects.  In later interviews, writer Richard Matheson claimed that the film was bedeviled with script doctors that ruined the central premise of a white shark swimming upstream and becoming trapped in a lake. I think the only reason to maybe watch the film is to see Lea Thompson in her feature film debut and Dennis Quaid in an early role.",

            "content": "Ever since I was a little kid, I have always loved the first two Jaws films, and I remembered when I watched the less than stellar third and fourth films. I hated them both and for many years, I didn't watch them again until I recently got a nagging feeling to revisit these widely despised sequels, in the hopes of being able to salvage them for camp value as I have become quite fond of stupid, trashy films.\n\nThankfully, I was able to salvage Jaws 3, at least (Jaws: The Revenge is another story) and I must say that I had quite a lot of fun watching this utterly ridiculous, unintentionally hilarious, and completely inept film.\n\nThe plot follows the Brody brothers who are now grown up. Mike now has a girlfriend and works at Seaworld, while Sean...I don't remember what the hell he does, but anyways, he decides to visit Mike even though he has a petrifying fear of the water after the events of the first two films.\n\nSomehow, after getting through the gates, not one, but two Great White sharks have found their way into Seaworld and begin to raise hell among the staff and park visitors. But, park management wants to keep the sharks alive to have the first ever Great White kept in captivity, but things don't go according to plan and now Mike, his girlfriend, his incompetent boss, and a suave British guy must do everything in their power to take down these beasts.\n\nOriginally, Jaws 3 was going to be a comedy in the tradition of the National Lampoon's franchise, but Spielberg and some other higher-ups shot this idea down and what we got instead was a film that was even hokier than what it would have been had it stayed a comedy.\n\nThe acting is terrible across the board, even with talented stars like Dennis Quaid and strangely, Louis Gossett, Jr. who just came off the superb An Officer And A Gentleman two years earlier who plays the incompetent park manager. It's especially funny to watch the scene where Quaid's character tries to warn people about the shark by stealing a golf cart, crashing it, pushing people out of the way, and shouting almost incoherently into a bullhorn. All the acting is way over the top and the characters are idiotic and unintentionally hilarious.\n\nAs far as shark mayhem goes, there is a lot of it...and a lot of it is absolutely terrible special effects combined with shoddy remnants of 80's 3D effects to remind you of just how awful it looks. There's a lot of blood, people getting eaten, scenes of peril due to severe park negligence and idiocy, and more. It's all quite entertaining to watch as the ineptitude unfolds and you will be astounded and amazed by the shoddy special effects. The ending is also hilariously bad when the characters end up forgetting about the lives of others and are instead thrilled and happy to see the dolphins happily jumping in and out of the water.\n\nMost baffling of all is the Seaworld advertising, because the film is set there and constantly talks about attractions there. What company would want their business associated with people being eaten by sharks and being put into perilous situations like getting trapped under 40 feet of water in an enclosed space? What would the advertisements be like? \"Come experience Seaworld! The place where negligent management will insure that both our employees and park visitors will be put into life-threatening scenarios involving sharks and being trapped in underwater tunnels! Because here at Seaworld, we don't give a fuck about you.\" That's honestly what this advertising feels like, which is why it still baffles me.\n\nIn terms of its actual quality, Jaws 3 is a monumental train wreck of a film that has earned its scorn (Unlike Jaws 2 which is unfairly maligned). However, I will compliment the beautiful music by Alan Parker as probably the only legitimately good thing about the whole film. Only the most hardened veterans of crappy film-watching will be able to survive this film because the story is ridiculous and filled with strange advertising, the acting and dialogue are terrible, the special effects are stunningly bad, and it is incompetently made in almost every other area as well...and yet, I can't help but like it because of those reasons.",

(oooh!) even a reed gets bafflingly poked right into the lens, it's like they started running out of things to have pop out in 3D. The acting is of course awful, also the shark somehow looks even more fake than the one in the second film, which looked even worse than the one in the first, and  the plot is kinda silly brilliance, the shark this time gets loose in a sea world style undersea kingdom/amusement park and wreaks havoc amongst the visitors. The thing is about this film is, yes it's rubbish, but A. It's a good laugh, especially if your a bit drunk and watching with your mates, mostly for the amusing \"3D\" moments, and B. At least it's not Jaws: The Revenge. You also get unintentionally funny bits like Dennis Quaid, in a little episode, going insane trying to warn everyone about the shark and seemingly causing more havoc than the rubber beast, knocking over popcorn trays, knocking over commentators, crashing buggies, shouting truly incomprehensible dialogue, BLOO, BLEE, BLAH, GEDDOU DA WADA!!! it's hilarious, and you get the worst special effect ever in the last scene, when the astonishingly dodgily blue screened plastic shark fly's through the screen, it's amazing, just jaw droppingly bad looking, but also wonderful in it's sheer, blatantly cheap, poor quality. But really Jaws 3 is great fun for all the above reasons, an amusingly sincere and brilliantly cartoonish wonky relic from the early 80's red and green spec era of 3D.

            "content": "And thus, ladies and gentlemen, we continue the saga of \"The History of the Blockbuster, as Told by a Shark\". The \"Jaws\" series pretty much did establish the stereotypical course of blockbuster filmmaking as we now know it, because the first was just you're regular old good blockbuster, the second was an inferior yet reasonably decent obligatory-feeling follow-up, and now we have the third installment, a follow-up as forced as its 3D that didn't make the final product any better. Actually, I say that, but I saw this film in 2D, so for all I know, the 3D version of this film was sensational. Yeah, maybe if it was actually tangible and had a scene where they handed back my money, even though my seeing this film didn't really cost me anything, except maybe my precious time. Well, I suppose that's what happens when your director isn't even a director, but the production designer on the first two films, and I only mention the first two films because I'm dubious that Joe Alves also provided production design effort on this film, seeing as how most everything seemed to be CG. Actually, scratch that, because the sets looked real, and every other effect, whoah boy, were anything but. It all goes into creating the ridiculous cheesiness that ruined this film and, well, actually made it rather amusing, definately not to where it made it as good as decent, but decidedly to where it made the film laughable enough to only be passable , which isn't to say that the camp isn't the only thing to undeniably enjoy in this film, to a certain degree.\r\n\r\nI don't really want to call the film tense, because \"Jaws 2\", as well-done and chilling as it was, was still considerably less tense than \"Jaws\", and you better believe that with this cornball film with bad effects and the occasional limp action sequence, scares fall to the point of just about collapsing clean out of sight (That little bit with the bloated corpse they find in a water tank was pretty messed up though). However, whether it be because they were really forcing the in-your-face 3D or whatever, there is a degree of inspiration put into the action sequences, quite a few of which have their moments of play with the steadily-rising-intensity action methods found in the predecessors, and while this film is certainly not competent enough to absorb a whole lot of tension from that, there is an undeniable degree of engaging thrill in beholding some of these action sequences. Still, in between that, you get more than your fair share of cheesiness, though, quite honestly, not quite as much as I expecting. Don't get me wrong, this film is a mess and as dumb as a stump, but inspiration as palpable, as the film isn't totally inept, and while that typically means that a film of this type isn't even bad enough to be enjoyable, here, that moderate degree of inspiration in Joe Alves' direction, married with amusing ambitious misfire, gives the film a certain aura of charm, and certainly entertainment value. Certain spots are livlier than others, but on the whole, the film rarely limps out, keeping consistent with events made entertaining by Alves' livliness and charm, made all the stronger by some of our leads' pretty unexpectedly decent chemistry, which gives the film a bit more of a human touch. I went into this film expecting a disastrous display of inexcusably uninspired filmmaking, and while the screenwriters and producer seemed to go in with that type of sensibility, Joe Alves' directorial execution, while also more tremendously disastrous than not, has enough charming ambition and occasional inspiration at its back to carry this film past contempt. Still, make no mistake, this film is more disastrous than not, maybe not on the level I was expecting, and definately not on the level where it's beyond redemption through ambitious charm and mild inspiration, yet most certainly to where the film could never be anything more than mediocre, with flaws that fall well beneath mediocre.\r\n\r\nAs I said, the film does get surprisingly rather thrilling here and there, yet on the whole, not much in the way of consequence can be felt, and for numerous reasons, one of which being this film's decision to experiment with more effects than just those of a 3D nature. Now, this is 1983 for goodness' sakes, so I'm not asking for Michael Bay here, people, but really, many of these digital effects can not at all be excused for the cheesiness of their concepts and poorness of their rendering, and it doesn't help that the film will sometimes linger too long on the abysmal CG, as well as use CG in places where they could have very easily used immensely more convincing practical effects, and on a few occasions the practical special effects fail to be all that special. The film is a technical mess, yet don't go thinking that things slips all over the place only during the handful of points where they play up the technical value, because the real scariest thing in this film is the script, such as it is. Guerdon Trueblood's story concept is underwhelming enough, but in the story's structure and execution at the hands of Carl Gottlieb and Richard Matheson, it's a disaster, because as if \"Jaws 2\" was conventional enough, this film relentlessly collapses into embarassing cliche into embarassing cliche, with uninspired plotting and overlong, uninteresting filler, and it's made all the worse by paper-thin and sometimes exaggerated characters, as well as absolutely dreadful dialogue, two aspects that are, in and of themeselves, made worse by the acting, or at least most of it. As I said, no matter how messy the acting gets, there is undeniable chemistry throughout the lead cast, with the strongest chemistry resting between Dennis Quaid and John Putch, largely because they're both actually pretty decent in their roles, yet outside of them and, well, quite a couple of passables (Ooh, Simon MacCorkindale was so charmingly British), there a few performance that lack - pardon the choice of words - \"bite\", with Bess Armstrong particularly making her lack of presence all the more stinging with plenty of cheesiness in the line delivery. Still, when you get down to it, one of the most key culprits behind this film's failure is the very man who helped the film in transcending total dismissal, for although director Joe Alves graces the film with some ambition and some inspiration, he just can't hold things together on the whole, and crafts a film that may not be bad, though certainly isn't good, just plain bland. Yes people, with all of its couple of high spots and many low spots, one of biggest the definitive reflections of this film's is simply blandness, as the film is with no real rewarding value, but plenty of missteps, and at the end of the day, it's the latter that you'll notice more, no matter how much the few strengths keep the missteps from really destroying this film, thus leaving the final product to dance pretty close to the waters of all-out terrible.\r\n\r\nOverall, the film doesn't quite \"bite\" the dust (Speaking of cheesy), being saved largely with the help of inspired moments in Joe Alves' direction, which provides unexpected engagement value during the action sequences, as well as a consistent degree of ambitious charm that, when complimented by fair chemistry throughout the cast and married with charming cheesiness within ambitious misfire, creates a kind of entertainment value that really does save this film from total collapse under the weight of its flaws, which isn't to say that flaws don't go drowned out, because with shoddy technical and a relentlessly cliched and cheesily poor script - whose flaws goes pronounced in execution by a few campy performances - incorporating cringe-worthy moments amidst constant blandness, \"Jaws 3\"... or \"Jaws 3-D\", or whatever version you're spending your time not too wisely watching, is left drifting as an utterly forgettable, considerably unrewarding and altogether tremendously underwhelming forced third installment for the once promising blockbuster saga.\r\n\r\n2/5 - Mediocre",

Mike Brody, now played by a thirty year old Dennis Quaid. What bizarre condition does he suffer from that causes such rapid aging?\r\nA young Great White is captured and put on display in the park but, in a plot twist lifted from \"Gorgo\", it's gigantic mother turns up looking for baby. You would think this would be a formula for cinematic carnage but it's incredibly dull and barely anyone gets eaten.

Even without the 3D gimmick it's still a bad movie. \r\n\r\nJaws 3 is about the sons of police chief Brody who must protect civilians at a Sea World theme park after a gigantic 35-foot shark becomes trapped in the park. The plot is really bad and uninteresting. No interesting characters, no memorable lines, nothing really stand outs from the plot. It's just really boring and the Whole Sea World setting makes it feel like a really bad advertisement for Sea World. The ending was just terrible as well, when our heroes escape you know what there main concern is, the Dolphins. The Dolphins have no importance to the plot and doesn't mention if any of the other characters are alive.  \r\n\r\nThe only redeeming quality is the music, mostly because the music doesn't talk and acts terribly. I'm serious when I say every time a person yells it sounds something like Taz from The Looney Tunes. The 3D gimmick doesn't work mainly because the DVD doesn't give you any 3D glasses and it looks really stupid. The camera work is really bad, you could clearly tell what parts were meant to be in 3D and the special effects are so bad there laughable. I literally saw a scene where Jaws was just floating slowly towards our characters, I reason I say floating is because Jaws doesn't move any part of his body.\r\n\r\nJaws 3 somehow manages to be just a boring movie. It's not unwatchable like some of the movies I watch, but it's certainly not worth your time.",

If you've seen 'Jaws' 1 and 2 you'd be expecting Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) to return, in 'Jaws 3' that is not the case. Instead Martin's sons Mike (Dennis Quaid) and Sean (John Putch) are the main characters here. I like how Spielberg touches on Sean's fear of the water as a result of the events that occurred in 'Jaws 2', but that's about it. The rest of the movie is really not that interesting or as suspenseful as the original 'Jaws' and 'Jaws 2'. I would not recommend this movie to anyone it was quite boring.",

            "content": "Mike Brody appears to be totally over the events that struck his family in his youth and now works in Florida's newest underwater attraction - Seaworld. His brother, Sean is less sure and never goes in the water - although a visit to see Mike and a new girlfriend help him confront his fear if not get over it. Meanwhile, something is picking off staff and swimmers getting Mike and the staff out on a shark hunt. They capture a small great white and take it into captivity, only for it to die when it is put in too small a tank. They think their problems are over until an examination of the bite marks on some bodies and they realize that the shark that did the killing is much, much bigger than the one they caught.\r\n\r\nI saw this film as a child but couldn't remember if it was any good or not - my childish fears may have made it scary even if the film was poor, so I decided to give it a go again recently. The first thing that struck me was the sheer rubbishness of the effects. In the original Jaws, Spielberg had hidden the shark as much as he could because the effects didn't work (and also therefore upping the tension); however here the makers just decide to show anything - a poorly superimposed image, a rubber shark, fake severed arms and so on - none of them are concealed, they are all shown up in all their rubbish glory. I could forgive it this due to its age but two other films had already managed to handle this issue before this film so I don't see why they went this route when it so clearly didn't work. Some shots are so bad that they could have been mistaken for being a spoof (witness the shark swimming towards the control room).\r\n\r\nOf course, after the poor effects the second thing that hits you is the laughable plot. True it is not as bad as part 4 in terms of plausibility but it is still pretty thin. No attempt is made to really give the characters any sort of, well, character and the very basic sea world plot just about manages to give the shark enough high profile feeding scenes to keep the film moving - just don't hold your breath for any logic or sense. In fact, the opposite is true and this film does deliver some moments that make you wonder what the writers were thinking when they conceived some of this stuff! The manner of Jaws' death here would be hilarious if it wasn't so darn pathetic. Even with the plot being poor the film should still have had at least a few moment of fear and tension - many of us fear being eaten alive so it isn't hard to draw on that, but this fails to have any tension or excitement to speak of. The effects suck a lot of this out - but a director who's name is listed in the dictionary alongside the work 'workmanlike' didn't do anything to stop the rot either.\r\n\r\nWithout characters the cast are set adrift with nothing to do - how Quaid must have envied Roy Schnieder in the first films, at least he was a good character. Quaid runs around the place, Armstrong screams, Putch broods, Thompson screams and Gossett tries to act tough in the middle of a script that gives him nothing to do. I don't blame the cast but I am disappointed that nobody mention how very bad taste it was to make a happy ending out of the dolphins surviving while so many other people had not!\r\n\r\nOverall this is just a bad film. I'm not a big one for lists so I'll not play that game here but it is pretty much without any value at all. The plot is poor, the effects are rubbish, the direction is weak, the script just a load of nonsense and there is a total lack of tension, thrills or excitement. The original is a classic and this film is further proof that sometimes classics should be just left alone.",

            "content": "Well one day I was on Thatguywiththeglasses.com watching some Nostalgia Critic episodes and a new one popped up for a review of Jaws 3. I was curious because I hadn't heard of that film before, so I watched the review. I had almost choked on one of the warheads that I was eating because I thought that Spielberg had something to do with it (at the time I had no idea that he wasn't the one who directed the second one). I ran to go check on my computer, and to my relief I found out that he had no relation to either of the films. Since I was almost stricken with grief, I decided that I had to rent a copy just to see it for myself. This film is proof that when a studio decides to release a sequel to a successful film and the director of the former film decides not to direct it then the studio should just not make a sequel, because their reputations and future successes will without a doubt begin to go down the tall slide of pure badness and severity. The idiots behind this idea must've had piggy banks flying around in their heads because no one would be so stupid as to ruin the reputation of a respected and masterful film. And as if it weren't enough, I hate it when movies use 3D, especially when it's used as a stupid stratagem in order to put more money in the studio's pockets. 3D is ok sometimes, like in How To Train Your Dragon, but here it's just an annoying and barbaric pile of hagfish guts.\r\n\r\nThe major failure in this film happens to be the special effects, which are so bad that they can't even match the effects of the first one, and all the first one had was an animatronic shark named Bruce. In fact, if they had just used Bruce from the original or the other shark from the second one then they would've been in the clear. But no, they had to try and use ingenuity and put crappy effects in the movie, which by the way wouldn't have been maturely developed until Young Sherlock Holmes was released. The new cast and crew starring in and working on the film didn't help to alleviate the mediocrity that the SFX had already given the film. The stars are all blatant cardboard cut outs of typical Hollywood clowns, and they are given roles that are either improbable or statistically ridiculous. Dennis Quaid gives it his all, but even he is in shambles as he tries acting like a real three-dimensional character. The director of the film, who happens to have been the production designer for the two previous Jaws films as well as the production designer for The Sugarland Express, doesn't seem to have the same grasp on the subject matter as Spielberg did. There's too much of an emphasis on making a special effects extravaganza instead of actually trying to make the film true to the mastery of it's source material (gee, does that sound familiar?). What's more is that the film is an embarrassment to the people who had a part in making it, and that's why people have to be careful what projects they work on. Oh, and there's one other small teeny tiny itsy bitsy little detail that they forgot in this film...IT WASN'T SCAAAAARRY!!!!!! How can you go from one of the greatest and scariest if not the greatest and scariest horror/thriller movie ever made to this pet project hullabaloo? One thing's for sure, once everyone saw this film they started saying, \"Well, I guess I can go in the water now.\" Oooh, but watch out for those fake sharks that seem to levitate even though there's a vacuum of the wet stuff pouring through an open window right next to them. If you haven't seen this film then don't bother doing so, because unlike some bad films that'll make you laugh because of their idiocy, this one will just make you mad, and trust me, you'll want to put the DVD in a toaster after seeing it. I almost did, but I had to return it. What a waste.",

            "content": "Jaws 3, People 0 was the original title for the tragedy, better known as Jaws 3-D.  It was actually planned as a comedy to parody the earlier movies in the series.  But somewhere down the line the studios changed their mind.  Too bad, because this movie is so bad, it actually is a comedy.  And it was this wonderful movie that started off Dennis Quaid's career.\r\n\r\nThe story tells about the continuing adventures of the Brody family and their tagalong shark.  Except this time, the main characters are the children of the family.  And according to the studio description, it's the great white shark that survived (I don't know how) the second movie, that is on their tail.  But now the shark comes with child and is a threat at Sea World, where the Brodys are at.  Honestly, this movie totally stinks and is as far away from the genius of the original as can be. It deserves a big 0.  Still, the movie is so bad that it is halarious, and I can't imagine it was not intended as a comedy.\r\n\r\nWe never actually see the shark(s) attack anyone.  Several times I was hoping it would.  Actually, I was almost begging it; please bite someone!  But this shark seems to not only have a sense of humor, but is blind too.  For example: In one scene, Dennis Quaid yells \"get out of the water! Shark in the water!\"  At this point in the film, no shark has been sighted yet.  The shark itself wakes up and says \"shark? where?\"  The shark comes up to the top of the water, notices waterskiers, speeds up to them and tags along right behind, probably wanting to be part of the team.  The waterskiers notice the playful fish, panic, and fall down all over the place.  This is where fishy could have a huge smorgasbord, yay!  But no, fishy is bored, so it decides to play over by the bumperboats instead.  Lea Thompson get bumped, receives a huge cut, starts bleeding, and again people are swimming all over the place.  The shark is bored yet again, not to mention half asleap, so it swims off to an underwater tunnel and bumps into it several times (probably trying to wake up) causing leakage and panic.\r\n\r\nHow do you even categorize or criticize this film?  First a blind shark that seems to swim up to its victims, but instead of attacking, smiles, says \"hi\" and then wants to play.  But if the people don't want to play, the shark may growl (literally) and play tag instead.  And when you have a character that has just escaped the flooding of the underwater tunnel who then turns around, starts running back yelling \"I need my wallet!\", you know you can't take it seriously.  I also read that there was a risk that Roy Scheider was going to be brought into this movie. He made sure that he was going to be busy filming \"Blue Thunder\" instead, so there was no risk that he would be part of this \"masterpiece\".\r\n\r\nFor some reason, Jaws3-D also inspired me to sing these lyrics to the tune of The Brady Bunch theme song:\r\nHere's a story, about two kids named Brody\r\nwho had problems with two big sharks of their own\r\nthey were cursed to star in the film\r\nthat sucked completely\r\nanother chapter of the tragic Brody Bunch\r\n\r\nThis movie looks like something a group of flunking students in movie production class put together with bad props, cheesy special effects and under the leadership of Ed Wood.  I would actually watch it again because I can't remember the last time I laughed so much.  I still wonder how in the world they got oscar winning actor Louis Gossett Jr. and oscar winning composer Alan Parker to even consider being a part of it.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who want something to laugh at, you'll enjoy this.  But for those who want a good movie, run away!  Far far away!",

            "content": "There have been a lot of 3D movies recently. Some of the ones that stuck out and helped drive the format, whether they were good or bad, are as follows: Avatar, Alice in Wonderland, How To Train Your Dragon, Clash of the Titans, Toy Story 3, and even the horrendous The Last Airbender. However, movies like Spy Kids 3D: Game Over prove, 3D wasn't always a cool trick or an easy way for studios to make a quick buck. It was once a format that was dorky, chintzy, and headache-inducing. Friday the 13th Part III and Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare were prime examples of the gimmick being cheap and unattractive, but the biggest abuse of the format is Jaws 3, better known as Jaws 3D.\r\n\r\nIt was only like that in theatres, since most home videos or TV stations couldn't replicate the 3D technology, so it comes off as someone leering at you when you're sitting down. Seriously, they try so hard to pass off a shot as 3D that I keep thinking the camera is going to bump into them like in Spaceballs. \r\n\r\nIn addition to that, the special effects are a joke. Steven Spielberg was disappointed with the shark puppet that he made up for the first Jaws, so he used other filming techniques to hide it until the film's climax. This heightened the terror and made Jaws one of the best horror films ever. Spielberg was not involved with any of the sequels that I can recall, so the filming techniques make it painfully obvious that the shark looks like a rubber pool toy (and with a shot where Jaws moves at the camera perfectly still and suddenly makes a glass pane appear and break, that's probably not a bad guess).\r\n\r\nI think I've spent enough time bitching about the amateurish effects and lack of 3D. Now I need to take on the characters and story. It takes place in Sea World as they're about to open a new underwater attraction. Jaws is interfering, so the staff and some of the park's financiers want to catch it. O_O That's a weird product plug. Why would you want to market your amusement park as having Jaws in it, the biggest man-eating shark in the world? That's like Disneyland advertising that they have a Tron attraction that is an actual grid that you download yourself into and fight for your survival through video games. It sounds cool, but 23 people died in the original Tron, and I'm expecting a much higher toll in Tron Legacy.\r\n\r\nThe characters that get the most screentime here are the Brody brothers, played by Dennis Quaid and John Putch; and their girlfriends, played by Bess Armstrong and Lea Thompson. \r\nThey are dull beyond reason. They tried to make these heroes more like real people, but I think the writing staff went out of their way to give them no personality at all. It's like watching Pokemon and having the animators dump mud on all the Pokemon except Pikachu and Meowth.\r\n\r\nI really don't have anything else to say. This movie doesn't deserve to be associated with 3D any more than Justin Bieber deserves to be associated with music. I have two more Jaws sequels to do this month, and they won't be done in any particular order. So next time, I will tackle Theodore Rex.

The effects are the absolute worst, ever!This is the grand \"so bad it's good\" movie. It's also intresting to see Dennis Quaid during his early years. Another positive I have is the setting, which takes place in SeaWorld. I find it quite odd that they chose SeaWorld, because I wonder how they'd advertise having Jaws in the park.

Whereas Jaws II maintained the cast of the original Speilberg clasic, Jaws 3 loses everyone and starts over anew with a fresh set of shark attacks at a Seaworld facility that is just about to open.  Originally released in 3D, Jaws 3 becomes even more hilarious today when the film is viewed without 3D effects because the moments are just so cheesy and awful.  Featuring hilariously terrible performances from Dennis Quaid, Louis Gossett Jr., and Lea Thompson, Jaws 3 is memorable on for its stupidity.  It receives two stars solely because it is so bad that it becomes enjoyable in its own campy kind of way.",

It's abundantly clear that Jaws 3 is a movie where the cast and crew had a great time filming, unfortunately, that fun doesn't transcend from the screen to the audience. Instead of a guilty pleasure, Jaws 3 comes off as tedious and laughable. Again, not laughable in a \"fun\" way, just laughable in a \"you have got to be kidding me\" kind of way. As much as I love Dennis Quaid, he doesn't really bring much to the role and neither does anybody else in this film. The only person I had a good time watching was Lea Thomspon's character. Not only do I have a huge crush on Lea Thompson (Back when she was cute in the 80's, she's getting kinda old now), but her character is the most fun character on screen.

The dismembered body parts \"floating\" towards you in slow motion really aren't all that effective anymore. \n\nI had remembered that this film takes place at a water park, but I had completely forgotten that the water park happened to be Sea World!

By that time he (who is this time a she) has worked up quite an appetite, and proceeds to eat some tourists and employees at Sea World, in Florida. That park is the second biggest star of this movie, which is no match for ''Jaws'' but probably no worse than ''Jaws II.'' It's harmless but unsurprising.\r\n\r\nI had to read the production notes for ''Jaws 3,'' which opened yesterday at the Rivoli and other theaters, to realize that two of the nice young men in the story are supposed to be the sons of Police Chief Brody of Amity, who was played by Roy Scheider in the first two films. Mike (Dennis Quaid), who has certainly grown up quickly, is now chief engineer at Sea World, and his brother Sean (John Putch) has come to visit. Also on hand are Kathryn (Bess Armstrong), a spunky marine biologist who is having the underwater equivalent of an office romance with Mike. Calvin Bouchard (Louis Gossett Jr.), the park's supervisor, is around,too.\r\n\r\nNothing much happens to any of them during the film's first hour, which revolves around the capture of a reasonably harmless great white shark hardly bigger than a station wagon. Kathryn wants to keep it alive in captivity, while a sleazy film maker named FitzRoyce (Simon MacCorkindale) thinks the shark ought to be killed on camera, or else turned into a tourist attraction. Then the little shark's mother puts in an appearance. The mother is roughly the size and shape of a 35-foot-long battering ram, and she has a much nastier disposition than junior's.\r\n\r\nAside from integrating the mother shark into the wonders of Sea World -as a fin behind a chorus line of water skiers, say - the chief job of the director, Joe Alves, is to find ways to call attention to the process. Mr. Alves has used a lot of undersea footage that is interesting enough to watch, even if it's often more decorative than scary.\r\n\r\nAlthough ''Jaws 3'' introduces some novel inside-the-shark'smouth chewing shots, it's less gory than its predecessors. Without Steven Spielberg's timing or John Williams's music, the shark's periodic visits become feeding scenes rather than ferocious attacks. It's like watching someone make regular raids on a refrigerator in search of midnight snacks.\r\n\r\nThe Jaws cycle has reached its nadir with this surprisingly tepid Jaws 3.\r\n\r\nGone are Roy Scheider, the summer resort of Amity, and even the ocean. They have been replaced by Florida's Sea World, a lagoon and an Undersea Kingdom that entraps a 35-foot Great White, and a group of young people who run the tourist sea park.\r\n\r\nThe picture [from a screen story by Guerdon Trueblood] includes two carry-over characters from the first two Jaws, Scheider's now-grown sons, who are played by nominal star Dennis Quaid as the older brother turned machine engineer and kid brother John Putch.\r\n\r\nFemme cast is headed by Bess Armstrong as an intrepid marine biologist who lives with Quaid.\r\n\r\nDirector Joe Alves, who was instrumental in the design of the first Jaws shark and was the unsung production hero in both the first two pictures, fails to linger long enough on the Great White.",

No amount of cheap 3D fx can save this laughable misfire, that contains the absolutely worst looking shark fx in the entire Jaws canon, ( which includes the abomination, Jaws The Revenge. )   Joe Alves,  Jaws' production designer,  was hired to helm this mess. \r\n\r\n  Plot :   Chief Brody's son now works in a Sea World like amusement park, alongside  perky Bess Armstrong's dolphin trainer.   A worker by the gate to the ocean gets chomped by Baby Great White, who likes the taste of yummy humans so much,  it decides to swim into the park,  and proceeds  to munch on guests and water skiing employees .  Baby Great White is caught and put on display, much to the delight of park owner,  Louis Gosset Jr ( fresh from his Oscar win for An Officer and A Gentleman )\r\n\r\n   Baby Great White dies.  35 foot mommy Great White comes cruising,  looking for her kid.   Mommy gets royally pissed off,  taking out the Undersea kingdom.  Tourists trapped underwater!  They need rescue!  Dennis and Bess look quasi-concerned.   Lea Thomson is shark snack food.    Did I mention this was in 3D ?  The third dimension isn't terror, it's boredom.",

As a 12 year old back then I made a few observations about the movie which still hold water (pardon the pun) today.   \r\n  First of all, I was amazed that this was a 3D movie which didn't require red and blue/green lenses but used shades like those of a modern 3D movie.  It suprised me that I didn't see any other film utilize this until the recent offerings.\r\n  Secondly, so much time and effort had been given to the 3D aspect that the shark looked quite unrealistic and the effects in general suffered hugely in comparison to its predecessors. Part of the fear factor in the first films was derived from the fact that you couldn't see the shark in its full glory; we were given glimpses, glimpses that looked like a real shark, glimpses that made us believe that this shark was a predatory animal after its prey.  In this movie, so much was shown of the shark that we could plainly see that it was a fake; in one scene we see a diver being attacked by the shark with its mouth open, attempting to 'bite' the diver without moving its jaws.  Near the end we see a model of a shark in a blue screen scene (not a good move); obviously a model shark, obviously not performing the movement it is supposed to be portraying. \r\n\r\nThis movie is bad.  You may gain some pleasure from it but it is drastically inferior to the first and second and is a different kind of movie from the other two in its perspective.\r\n \r\n  Well, that's what I thought when I was twelve.  I did win (or rather my mother did, to her shame) a Long Playing record of the soundtrack which, I have to say, was much better than the movie; You could listen to some of the music and imagine underwater scenes, including a realistic shark.",

Vaguely linked to the previous storylines, a young male meant to be the original Sheriffs son is working in a waterpark, when it inadvertadly houses a 35 foot shark in its confides. How the beast goes unnoticed in such a small remit I don't know, but after devouring several of the staff and public, the owners and remaining workers begin to believe that such a monster is actually living within the resort. Torn between whether to utilise the opportunity to benefit the facilities profits, or whether to just kill the thing, enough time passes for a few more people to die before they eventually arrive at the sensible move. Famed for having several moments of suspense in prior movies, this edition lacks that cutting edge, and instead attempts to throw some gore in to spice matters up. Unfortunately that move degrades it even further, and but for some reasonably credible acting, there's not too much originality or credibility to be extracted from this. This appears to be a much unwanted step back from the classic thrillers we've witnessed before and unlike those, leaves us with no on screen connection to any of the lead characters. Possibly produced on the back of its names credentials and undisputed success, it might be best to now put an end to the series before it gets itself famed for all the wrong reasons.",

There is very little mention of the past events and i don't even remember Roy Scheider's character even being mentioned (although his death was referenced in Jaws 4) in this movie any more than a passing thought.The entrance of the sharks was so......convenient? And they seemed to be following the play-book to the absolute letter (at the start) then they just bring the sharks (baby then mother) out into the open.The only real memory, from seeing that movie, was going \"Hey, it's the guy from 'Manimal'!\" (Simon MacCorkindale) who, if you weren't a kid growing up in the 70-80s, you would have almost no reference to understand who he was. The animation (from this age) was laughable but, back then, it was passable.Let's sum it up: The story was just terrible, the structure changed too much and too fast, and some the characters were (in that era) at the top of their game.The movie is \"watchable\" (like background or \"i'm too stoned to get off the couch so i'll watch this\") but not something you would (probably) waste time to see twice.",

The second Jaws movie and first sequel had a great ending with the shark being electrocuted or something was okay but sucked compared to the 1975 original which was faultless besides the ending which was daft..... JAWS 3 however has none of the original characters like Chief Brody from the first two movies but has Dennis Quaid (The Parent Trap)and a bunch of other crap actors. The shark looks fat, fake and pretty hilarious to say the least and if it were a shark who could operate on land instead of in the water I could easily outrun it because it's slower than a snail. All of the characters are unlikeable except Quaid who I like. There is blood and a few deaths and it's done well and the scene where the shark breaks the glass panel underwater and it shatters and makes the humans have to swim for their life is good.

More of the shark was wanted, but I would personally say that about the preceding two films as well.Parts of this 1983 flick that are terrible, though, are the special effects, especially right at the end. There is also some poorly done green screen and it, clearly, has a dire cover. There's no doubting this being made was a cash grab, that's basically the only reason to ever go 3-D, but a cash grab doesn't necessarily mean it's an awful film; which this isn't, in my opinion.
