            "content": "Charles McArthur and Ben Hecht met when both were reporters in Chicago during the 1920s. They created two of the funniest farces in American drama, TWENTIETH CENTURY (about theater people) and THE FRONT PAGE. The latter was based on their experiences as news reporters in those crazy days in Chicago, where the newspapers concentrated on sensationalism and the politics was thoroughly corrupt. The resulting play is hysterically funny and yet remains timely. For all the exaggeration of how Walter Burns and Hildy Johnson manipulate police, politicians, reporters, and civilians to get their scoop, the story remains relevant for several reasons. The political balance in a big Mayoralty election is precarious due to the Earl Williams case. Williams has shot a policeman who is African-American, a big local voting block, and they want him punished. The corrupt Mayor and his idiot jail warden are willing to execute him for the votes needed to stay in office, but the Governor (who is from the rival party) believes the killer is insane (or at least mentally deficient). So already (as you see) race, politics, and the validity of the death penalty get pulled in. Soon we also see examples of nepotism and corruption in the police, and City Hall, cynical politics based on a man's life, and questions about privacy and a free press. For a play from 1931 this one still has relevance.There had been an earlier version of the play in the 1930s called THE FRONT PAGE, starring Adolphe Menjou as the conniving and devious Walter Burns, and Pat O'Brien as ace reporter Hildy Johnson. It is a good version, and both stars do well with their parts (and both have the verbal speed necessary for the dialog to flow over the ears of the audience). But when the film was remade in 1940, Howard Hawks decided to redraw Hildy Johnson into a female reporter (and previous wife) of Burns. His casting of Cary Grant was radically different too. Burns is a nasty, conniving s.o.b. who would kill for a good story. Menjou was somewhat dapper (he was usually dapper) in the role, but the hardness under the presentable shell was there. And by changing Hildy from a guy to a gal, and Walter's former wife, you had to make Walter look more interesting. So Walter is turned into Cary Grant. There was a search for Hildy, involving Jean Arthur and Irene Dunne as possibilities. Neither ended up playing him. Instead it went to Rosalind Russell.It has to be admitted Russell had the vocal abilities to push the dialog at the proper clip. Possibly Jean Arthur could have done that just as well, but Arthur did not have the apparent physical strength behind the stylishness that Russell showed. She really does balance well (in this film) with Grant, given their characters.Motivation changes a little. This Walter Burns still wants to get his scoops, but there are moments of fragility when he realizes he may forever lose Hildy to her fianc\u00e9 Bruce (the ever helpless Ralph Bellamy). And they oddly work (Hawks manages to keep them under control). Also, as the story is now twelve years older than the original play, certain changes occur in Walter's political views. He does dislike the gang (led by Clarence Kolb and Gene Lockhart) running the city, and points out to Hildy that they have a chance to help give the city the sort of government New York City has under La Guardia. This does not end his joy at scooping the opposition, but it does suggest that Burns has more depth.It is now generally believed that this is the best of the film versions of THE FRONT PAGE, and one of the funniest films ever made. The entire cast shines (look at the scene where Helen Mack confronts the reporters who have made her look like a tramp, and have told lies about John Qualen (Williams) - she is in a state when Russell takes her out of the press room, and the reporters are thoroughly ashamed of herself - and Russell comes back looking at Regis Toomey, Porter Hall, and the others, and says \"Gentlemen of the Press!\" with heavy cynical irony). And also note Billy Gilbert's immortal Joe Pettibone, the most hopeless monument of total befuddlement in movies. It is one of the few film comedies of that period that retains it's laughs one viewing following another.",

            "content": "This screen adaptation of the Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur play \"The Front Page\" was adapted for the talents of Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell -- there is no such character as Hildy Johnson (Russell) in that play.Director Howard Hawks wanted to show the whirlwind pace of the newsroom in the criminal courts system so he had his actors overlap their lines -- so much so that at times it seems as though everyone is talking at once; it even gets difficult to understand all that is going on.He also had the cast move FAST so the film looks totally frenetic from scene to scene with no respite -- either from the laughs or from the action.There are two really good \"inside\" jokes in the script: The first is where Walter Burns (Grant) is describing Hildy's fiancee and says that \"he looks like that guy in the movies -- Bellamy,\"  Well, it WAS Ralph Bellamy playing that part!The other is when Burns says something about someone he once knew named \"Archie Leach\" which just happens to be Cary Grant's real name.This is one of the true gems of Hollywood's most prolific era.  It has incredible pacing, acting, photography and an authentic gritty feeling that would be associated with hard-boiled, \"anything for a story\" newspaper people.It has long been one of my favorite films and deserves to be watched over and over again -- just for all the dialogue and great acting that may have gone by so fast you missed it the first time.",

            "content": "Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell make great sparring partners in \"His Girl Friday,\" a remake of \"The Front Page.\" Grant plays the conniving newspaper publisher Walter Johnson, and Rosalind Russell is the reporter Hildy Johnson, a woman this time, and Johnson's ex-wife. She's trying to get remarried, move to Albany, and quit the newspaper business, but Walter can't bear it. He cons her into helping out with a controversial death row case and then makes sure her fianc\u00e9e (Ralph Bellamy) suffers a series of mishaps - arrest for stealing a watch, arrest for \"mashing,\" arrest for counterfeiting, and the theft of his wallet. This all happens while Hildy interviews Earl Williams, a man due to be hung the next day... and then hides him in a roll-top desk in the courthouse press room when he escapes during a psychiatric evaluation.It's madcap, all right, and there are no two better people to carry it off than Grant and Russell, who make a great team. It's a hilarious story, with the most rapid-fire, non-stop dialog ever heard anywhere, often with several conversations going on at once. It's exhausting trying to keep up with it.Strangely, without computers and cell phones, the story of journalists working on a story holds up because the emotions and activities are realistic and still go on. It's as Hildy describes - no set schedule, no normal meals, and long hours. Nothing much has changed.This is a frenetic comedy, and while the impending hanging of Earl Williams is certainly serious, this plot is more of an excuse to observe the machinations of Hildy and Walter - it's a subplot, though it drives the main story.\"The Front Page\" is a favorite of Hollywood's, remade many times - three versions under its original title, a TV series, two TV productions, plus the film \"Switching Channels.\" And of course, \"His Girl Friday,\" possibly the best of all of them.",

Originally done as 'The Front Page', the play by Hecht and McArthur takes on new life here as the character of Hildy Johnson metamorphoses in this version to be a sparky woman (played by Rosalind Russell), former wife of the harassed columnist Walter Burns (played with characteristic bewilderment and charm by Cary Grant). Hildy is about to marry again, to the nice but dull Bruce Baldwin (played by Ralph Bellamy as a character so boring he 'is like Ralph Bellamy' - how Hollywood liked its in-jokes).With that fire-cracking script, a sizable amount of sparks between Grant and Russell, and good support from Bellamy and a cast which includes Gene Lockhart, Cliff Edwards, Clarence Kolb, and Regis Toomey, 'His Girl Friday' is one of those classic gems which never age and which remain hugely entertaining.",

Jerry Bruckheimer's most hyperbolic action movie ain't got nothing' on this one.Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell were a brilliant screen pair (indeed, it seems that no one was bad casting when paired with Cary Grant) as rival reporters in a furiously paced news office. Russell is the odd man, or should I say odd girl, out, due to her lack of a penis, but she proves herself more than capable of holding her own with the boys.Russell charges across the screen and never loses momentum for a second. She's goofy, sexy and hysterical. The funniest moment in the film comes when she's chasing a man down the street (I won't go into details) and dive tackles him to the ground.One of the first films from the 40s and a highlight of the decade.Grade: A+",

            "content": "Whoever had the bright idea to turn the Ben Hecht-Charles MacArthur play, The Front Page into a boy and girl comedy ought to get a Nobel Prize for comedy if such an award had been available at the time. Of course it helps when one of your two main characters has an ambiguous first name like Hildy. Short for Hildreth when Pat O'Brien plays it, Rosalind Russell is all female in this one. Russell bites off a huge chunk of Katherine Hepburn career woman territory here and she digests it well. She's the best reporter on the staff of the Morning Post and her editor Cary Grant doesn't want to lose her no way. At one time he even married her, but that didn't take. They're divorced now and Russell is fed up and decides she wants a home and children and security and Ralph Bellamy is going to give her all of that. Plus a home with his mother Alma Kruger for a year in Albany.As her friendly rival reporter Regis Toomey says, there ain't no way that Russell could ever leave the newspaper game. She proves it when she goes to work on that one last assignment to cover an execution at the state penitentiary.Even though Howard Hawks did add a romance into The Front Page he did not sacrifice one iota of the biting satire from Hecht and MacArthur. If you watch the either The Front Page or His Girl Friday or even the remake from the eighties Broadcast News you will swear the world is made up of boobs and nitwits and the only smart people around are journalists. Too often however that's proved to be the case.Poor meek John Qualen who was listening to some radicals speaking and got caught up in the moment and accidentally shot a black police officer. Back then ethnic politics were played to the hilt and a law and order mayor, Clarence Kolb, wants to see Qualen executed. His brother-in-law, sheriff Gene Lockhart means to see the sentence is done.Cary Grant's paper is against capital punishment at least for this poor schnook. Of course when Qualen escapes all kinds of complication arise and Russell's on the job to report them.As he was in The Awful Truth, Ralph Bellamy is there to be the slightly befuddled doofus who loses the girl to fast talking Cary. Bellamy's performance is a brilliant piece of work itself. He's so funny because he plays the part absolutely straight and the humor falls around him.Howard Hawks assembles a really grand cast of memorable character actors. My favorite however, brief though his scenes are is Billy Gilbert who is a messenger from the governor who is delivering a sentence commutation. The poor man gets waylaid and involved in all kinds of intrigue that is all going on over his head. You have to see him to believe how funny he is and he does it without a sneeze.His Girl Friday successfully combines screwball romantic comedy with biting satire and no seams show it all in the stitching. It's a blueprint on how to do successful cinema comedy.",

            "content": "As if creating one comedic masterpiece with 1938's BRINGING UP BABY was not enough, director Howard Hawks returned to the same genre a scant two years later - and he somehow managed to rival even his own previous masterwork. Nominally a reworking Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's play THE FRONT PAGE, HIS GIRL Friday manages to surpass it's classic source material and emerge as one of the screen's finest comedies. The film is also perhaps the perfect example of Hawks' trademarked rapid-fire, overlapping dialogue, which has never been as fast nor as furious anywhere else before or since. This is certainly one of the fastest moving comedies ever filmed, and the whole cast never misses a beat.Walter Burns, the conniving, self-serving newspaper editor, is a character that could have easily come off as a tyrannical jerk. As portrayed by the suave Cary Grant, however, the pompous, arrogant Burns actually becomes (gasp!) likable! It is a difficult balancing act that Grant must perform as teetering between the two extremes of the character, and he is arguably the only actor imaginable with the skill and charisma to pull such a tricky characterization off this successfully. And the one-and-only Rosalind Russell is every bit his match - full of verve and aplomb, Russell's Hildy is an independent career woman, brimming with intelligence and class, that impressively pre-dates the major feminist movement of the mid-sixties by a good 25 years.The film's supporting cast is no less impressive, with every single role cast to perfection. This is particularly true of Ralph Bellamy, who (along with his Oscar-nominated performance in 1937's THE AWFUL TRUTH) proves once again that he is the ultimate straight man. The film contains some grim subject matter that may seem like unlikely fodder for a screwball comedy (murder, attempted suicide, and public execution are all touched upon), although the film somehow manages to deal with such topics respectfully and without sacrificing any laughs. In the end, HIS GIRL Friday is an absolutely unbeatable romantic comedy that remains wildly hilarious and comes as close to sheer perfection as any motion picture could ever hope to.",

I don't know but lots of people talking loudly at the same time over each others lines is just not my idea of something funny.On top of that the movie doesn't really feature any good likable main characters. Despite the fact that I like Cary Grant and he was always able to play a likable scoundrel, his character in this movie just didn't worked out to me. He was more a very selfish character than a funny one really and more annoying than amusing. Same goes for Rosalind Russell, who basically plays the same sort of character as Grant. They really deserved each other.The movie entirely goes for its screwball comedy elements but it forgets basically everything else. It forgets it has a story with also some romantic as well as dramatic elements in it. Because of this none of the romance and more serious intended moments within the movie just didn't ever worked out.To be honest, I quite liked the movie in the beginning and in general I'm also fond of these type of movies, especially when they star Cary Grant but about halve way through the movie totally started to loose track and the movie became an huge fast going mess. It's pace becomes incredibly high and lots of character constantly show up and are going away again just as fast as they came. The movie at that point basically becomes more of an annoying one to watch and it doesn't get any more better when it heads toward its ending.It's not like I hated watching this movie and it certainly does has its moments but for a movie that is considered a true genre classic, it's definitely a disappointing one.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "If BRINGING UP BABY has rapid-fire dialogue and one crazy scene after the other, HIS GIRL Friday goes even faster and is 10 minutes shorter. A story not that un-similar to THE PHILADELPHIA STORY which deletes the scatterbrained socialites in favor for a gritty, urban setting, Cary Grant is fantastic in his role as Walter Burns as he tries to win back his wife Hildy Johnson (an equally brilliant Rosalind Russell in full comic mode) by literally throwing her back into what she -- deep down -- loves best: reporting and the breakneck lifestyle that comes with being in front of the news. These two are on camera often, and their dialogue together is like a frenzied waltz: trying to follow every exact word, gesture, and snarl is quite a task, boy, does it sizzle! What a shame that this wasn't up for any awards, as this could have easily won in acting categories. Completely ahead of its times, this is an interesting view on feminism thirty years before the term became public knowledge, and if one listens closely, a study in verbal sexual interplay. Which shows that making Hildy Johnson a woman was the best decision a director could ever do to enhance a story.A remake of an earlier film (THE FRONT PAGE, 1931), itself a film version of a 1928 play, HIS GIRL Friday was remade again as THE FRONT PAGE in 1976 and yet again in 1988 as SWITCHING CHANNELS, with Kathleen Turner nicely holding up in her portrayal of the role that cemented Rosalind Russell as a skilled comedienne, this time set in media TV.",

Mr. Grant as Walter Burns, the unscrupulous newspaper editor, is the perfect foil for Rosalind Russell's, Hildy Johnson, a role that is played by a male in the original play and in the other film versions.The best moment of the film is the moment when Cary Grant speaking so fast, that some what he says goes over the viewer's heads, refers as to Ralph Bellamy by name as not having a chance and cites in the same breadth his real name Archibald Leach. It's hard to imagine anyone but Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell playing Walter and Hildy. Ralph Bellamy is perfect as Hildy's fianc\u00e9, Bruce Baldwin.

            "content": "\"'His Girl Friday' represents one of the major paradoxes of American narrative cinema \u2014 Hollywood's ability to incorporate images of social change into films that ultimately deny and frustrate the possibility of such change.\" - Tom PowersBefore Wilder's \"Ace in the Hole\" and Mackendrick's \"Sweet Smell of Success\" there was \"His Girl Friday\", Howard Hawks' motor-mouthed screwball comedy and light-hearted satire of both journalism and Chicago politics.The film is based on a 1928 play by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, but it was Hawks who came up with the idea of making the lead a woman. \"Write em as a guy and cast em as a broad,\" was Hawks' motto, a technique which resulted in a filmography filled with strong, masculine, bawdy women. This time around our heroine is Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell), a star reporter who has recently divorced Walter Burns (Cary Grant), editor at the Morning Post.Like most screwballs, \"His Girl Friday\" finds Walter and Hildy engaged in a battle of wits. They can't stand each another, but Walter nevertheless spends the entire film scheming to repair his relationship with Hildy. When the film's couple aren't cracking wise, Hawks engages in an altogether different affair, excoriating conniving journalists, newspaper editors and the political/media machinery of Chicago.At the heart of this criss-crossing satire is a character called Earl Williams, scheduled to be publicly executed for the shooting (and killing) of a black police officer. Every subset of the city, the film goes on to show, wants Williams executed for different reasons, the Mayor chasing African American votes, and the news desks itching for good ink. Their detachment is chilling; death reduced to filling column spaces. No better is Hildy's desire to twist Williams' story into a weapon to be used against the Mayor's local policies. Make Williams a scapegoat and damn the Mayor, she thinks.By the film's end, Williams has became a pawn in an ugly chess game in which everyone is wrong. Meanwhile, the news desks, politicians and police are all busy over-pyschoanalysing Williams. Each group hires \"experts\" to offer \"expert opinions\" on Williams' motivations. These \"experts\" are geared not toward finding the truth, but creating rationalizations, and therefore ammunition, for already held opinions, plans or policies.Hawks' films have always been amoral, dark and cynical, but \"His Girl Friday\" is particularly bleak. It's a film filled with sharks, leaches and back-stabbers, though a century of cynical films about newspaper men have rendered its satire impotent (even the cutting edge \"The Wire\", in its final season, can't get away from these clich\u00e9s). Likewise, modern viewers may find Hawks' once novel screwball antics somewhat dulled by a diet of TV sitcoms. Aesthetically the film is typical of Hawks, packed with rapid-fire banter, overlapping dialogue, virtually no dead air and snappy, fluid camera work. Hawks captures the energy and buzz of newsrooms. His film spits like a machine gun.Incidentally, upon release \"Friday\" was praised for \"promoting\" social change. Namely that of marriages being based on equality rather than exploitation, the notion that women might be economically independent, intelligent and self sufficient, and that new possibilities lay ahead in the roles of the sexes. In reality, however, the film boils down to rigid, old, gender roles. Men operate in a sphere of violence and corruption, a stance Hildy must herself adopt - her price of admission into their all-male world - in order to escape the world of female entrapment and domesticity. This domesticity, Hildy then decides, is not worth the effort leaving. In other words: play the game, be a ruthless man, or shut up and stay at home.8/10 \u2013 Worth one viewing.",

Both are nearly perfect and, for once, I have NO CRITICISMS WHATSOEVER about either film.Well, HIS GIRL Friday is a remake of the fine film THE FRONT PAGE. However, bucking a general trend, this film is definitely better than the original, as it is jam packed full of energy and snappy dialog. Just listening to the dialog between Grant and Russell is something to behold! I really think if they slowed down the film to normal speed, it would last about 30 minutes longer! But, despite its blistering speed, it works great. Watch and laugh--it just doesn't get much better than this.By the way, there are several wonderful inside jokes in the film. The first, and the funniest, is when Cary is describing his ex-wife's boyfriend to someone. He's at a loss for how to describe him and finally says that the guy \"looks like that actor,...Ralph Bellamy\"--and the guy playing the boyfriend IS Bellamy!! Then later, Cary is talking about a guy he knew named \"Arichie Leach\". Archie Leech is Cary Grant's REAL name! Cute touches like this, combined with the lightning-fast pacing, wonderfully overlapping dialog and general kookiness make this a MUST-SEE. Amazingly enough, Grant's comedies BRINGING UP BABY and ARSENIC AND OLD LACE are even better--if it's possible!!! See them all--you deserve it!!By the way, IF you can find a decent copy of THE FRONT PAGE (1931), it is well worth seeing and almost as good as HIS GIRL Friday. However, be forewarned that many DVD and videotapes are public domain copies that are unwatchable due to serious volume and print problems.",

            "review_title": "Fast Dialogue only savior for unsympathetic characters",
            "content": "When I learned about Howard Hawkes screwball comedy \"His Girl Friday,\" one of the biggest attractions, I was told, was the fast-paced/overlapping dialogue. During this time in Hollywood, dialogue would only be spoken by one person at a time. \"His Girl Friday\" was one of the first films to have characters speaking at the same time, often over one another; this would create an environment that was more realistic, especially in a place such as a newspaper room. Well, if that's what Hawkes was going for, he certainly achieved it.The best thing about the film IS the dialogue. Characters speak at a break-neck speed, throwing witticisms left and right as if they were candy. Many times, while one is laughing at one joke, they would miss another right after it. That is how quickly the jokes are thrown out in the film. Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are great at spilling lines out seemingly without any problem. It's a real testament to how professional these two were (along with the rest of the cast) with the amount of verbal meat they had to chew; I can't think of an actor today that could possibly pull of the kind of dialogue that was given in this film.The problem that I had with the film was that the dialogue was the ONLY great thing about it. Unfortunately, the characters and situations presented in the film had little sympathy and lack of any kind of real depth. The situation with the falsely accused murderer was handled poorly given the context of his predicament; instead of really caring about this person and really trying to help him become cleared of charges, the Grant and Rosalind characters instead used him for their own purposes in getting \"the big scoop.\" Now, of course one can argue that that WAS the reason they treated him the way they did, my issue is that such a serious subject was handled in a supposed \"comedic\" fashion; as if it was OK that this falsely accused person can be treated in such a horrible way, simply because it handled comedically. The last-second deus ex machina that sealed this person's fate supports the idea that his story wasn't really handled with any kind of importance.The thing the really hurt the film was the love triangle between the Grant and Rosalind characters, and the Rosalind's character's fianc\u00e9. We are told in the beginning of the film that Grant and Rosalind are divorcees, and Rosalind is set to marry her fianc\u00e9 the very next day in Albany. Of course, in a film like this, we are supposed to root for the Grant and Rosalind characters to get together at the end. the problem is, the Grant character is such a manipulative creep that at the end of the film I found myself actually rooting for the fianc\u00e9 to the win the girl. Three times in the movie, the Grant character manipulates the situation, causing the fianc\u00e9 to be thrown in jail, and preventing the would-be married couple from leaving the city. This in turn gives the Grant character enough time to convince Rosalind that she will always be \"a newspaperman.\" The Rosalind character isn't much better either. Throughout the beginning of the film, she keeps explaining to others that she is through with the newspaper business, that she wants to settle down, raise a family, and not have to deal with the daily grind of hunting down a story. Well, does settling down and having a family sound like a bad thing to you? I didn't think so. Every time she tries to leave, she gets bogged down and distracted by the story (many times through the very fault of the Grant character). It gets so bad, that when the fianc\u00e9 comes to her, begging her to leave with him, she brushes him off like a fly, barely acknowledging him. Even worse, when the fianc\u00e9's mother comes into play, the Rosalind character actually ALLOWS Grant to have her kidnapped and taken away! \"His Girl Friday\" would've worked if the filmmakers had cared enough about the characters than they did about the dialogue. The actor playing the fianc\u00e9 did a thankless job; without much to work with, he actually created a character we cared about more so than the two leads. Sure he was a little simple, but that's a lot more than can be said about the other two. At the end of the film, I thought to myself \"these two characters were divorced before the film started. Based on all the manipulative actions these two had throughout the story, is there any evidence that they'll stay together once the movie is over?\" Maybe they deserve each other, because they certainly don't deserve anyone else.",

How anyone can muster any sympathy for Grant's character is beyond me.  The crossfire dialogue is occasionally relieved by stretches of tedium.

            "content": "If Howard Hawks's screwball classic \"His Girl Friday\" isn't a perfect film, it had at least a perfect role for Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell... and that's the stuff durable greatness is made of.Indeed, Grant was the epitome of wisecracking charm and his Walter Burns happened to be an obnoxious fellow delivering so many wisecracks that by the time the receiver found the proper repartee, someone was already being verbally crucified.Rosalind Russell wasn't a star... yet... until she portrayed Burns' ace reporter and ex-wife Hildy Johnson, reliable and relatable 'girl Friday'. These two backgrounds explain why she plays in the same rhetorical league, she's a match to him... even when there's no matching anymore.But maybe because she's taller than many actresses, she can get above Grant's shoulder high enough not to be totally swollen off by his charismatic despicability. She talks the talks but can walk the walk even if he's gallant enough to hold her the door... but why would a woman calling herself a newspaperman expect gallantry? At a time where gender talk wasn't such a sensitive subject and this is where the film got tricky, Hildy is engaged to insurance agent Bruce Baldwyn and is determined to become his devoted housewife, to have children and live a peaceful life in Albany, of all the towns... so she expects some gentlemanly behavior from her editor and former husband... might as well expect Hitler to sign a Peace Treaty. The titular 'Girl Friday' can't wait for her existential 'week-end', torn between her job and her future. The way the film makes these two situations irreconcilable can seem far-fetched but given the way Hildy handles her job, it's hard to imagine the combo. The lady must make up her mind. Meanwhile, Burns gets an opportunity that instantly tilts in his mind \"thanks God, it's Friday!\".As usual with screwball comedies, the timing is crucial and when a top reporter is missing and an execution is polarizing opinions because of proclaimed insanity and suspicion of political motivations, someone must cover the news and Hildy happened to be in the right place at the right moment. For Walter, Hildy's presence is to be exploited even if it means using every bit of his malevolent creativity against the gentle but rather bland Bruce... who looks exactly like Ralph Bellamy, according to Burns (or was it Grant having fun with the script?). Given the mistreatment poor Bruce undergoes, \"His Girl Friday\" is a tale of Machiavellian ingenuity at the services of one profession: journalism. Basically, the ends justify the means if it means covering the hottest topic of the day (pre-war days but they didn't know).So Burns uses every trick of his sleeve to prevent Bruce from taking the train and forces Hildy to be on the front... and for the front, fully aware that her professional conscience will finally get the best of her. And there is something in Russell's performance, the way she resists the call of her profession while being fiercely attached to her fianc\u00e9e that calls for admiration. Whether she handles the other journalists who pose like vulture-like creatures, indifferent to the pleas of Williams' friend and hungry for any scandal or tip to it, she knows how to adapt her manners, to talk different languages, but that would be too easy with screwball comedy. We noticed from the start that the pace of the dialogue is as quick as if the box office depended on it, yet Hawks gratifies us with scenes where journalists and Burns are all together, sometimes, Bruce and Walter talk to Hildy and on the phone and the rhythm is so fast it sounds like harmonious cacophony. The film was known for having a dialogue that could be contained in a twice longer film but Hawks insisted on having something natural that could flow simply and easily because people did talk like this in real life. And only for the rapid fire delivery of Russell, I'm glad they didn't take someone else, I can't imagine Katharine Hepburn in that role, Russell had the street smarts, the modern touch, the look, the sexiness... she got the scandal but the only thing she didn't get was an Oscar nomination, and that was a scandal too.I didn't like the film at first because I have a problem with the schematic aspect of screwball comedies, the two men in love with the same woman and one of them has no chance because the other is Grant, that's why I didn't like \"The Philadelphia Story\"... but here, Grant is so unlikable you've got to wonder how come he had to get Russell at the end except to show that these two were equally unlikable thus meant to be together, which in that case makes the film modern in its daring anti-family bias. And the ending doesn't imply that Hildy made the right personal choices, maybe journalists have a way with every non-personal matters but are totally ignorant of the things of life. I recently saw \"Sweet Smell of Success\" and I guess it's a common trope of Hollywood to depict journalism as a business dealing with cops, politicians, uses of bribes or blackmails and many methods that can only give it a cynical flavor.Grant could embody these traits without being totally detestable, maybe it's because we try to see them from the eyes of Hildy and we accept that he's not such a bad guy after all. Ironically, when Hildy becomes the newspaper man, she lets the woman takes the upper hand and encourage Burns to show a more comprehensive and gentle side. But Hawks was a smart director, if he was smart enough to know that he could remake \"The Front Page\" with a gender swap, he could handle his characters as well.After all, they might be unlikable but they have a likable way to be unlikable, and that's also the stuff durable greatness is made on.",

The acting is marvellous, for me Cary Grant has never been better and I have yet to see a movie where Rosalind Russell was as tough as she was here.

There're more lines crammed into a 30-second spot here than there are in most 2-hour movies. Thank goodness most of them are funny. My guess is Grant and Russell went home at night, took out their tongues, and massaged them. So, can editor Walter (Grant) rescue reporter Hildy (Russell) from entering a conventional life with the agreeably dull Bruce (Bellamy). Walter's doing his best, by fair means or foul, mostly foul. Poor Bruce, it's like he's trapped in a jail cell revolving door thanks to the endlessly conniving Walter. Then there's the luckless Williams (Qualen), headed for the hangman's noose, and sounding like a communist when spouting such suspicious slogans as \"Production for use\". Looks like it's either the gallows or spending the rest of his life locked up in a desk. No wonder reporters are flocking around like flies on a carcass.This is madcap at its maddest, and I would guess signature roles for both Grant and Russell. Their pairing here turned into a casting coup for director Hawks, who specialized in rapid- fire, overlapping dialogue. The lines themselves are from the stellar writing team of Lederer and Hecht, so the humor comes legitimately. All in all, the movie's a genuine classic. But my advice is that if you're hearing impaired like me, be alert to the verbal rounds as they fly by. It's worth it.",

This film follows the basic structure of a screwball comedy, the girl and boy start off by disliking each other and going through many obstacles; which, eventually lead to them falling for each other. But, don't be fooled, even though this film follows the basic outline of a screwball comedy, this film goes above and beyond and original material and techniques. This film uses Overlapping Dialogue, which adds to the already fast-paced plot and script. Overlapping Dialogue was rare and this film used it in the best, organized way. His Girl Friday does not skip a beat, and has the audience on their toes anticipating what is going to happen next-not to mention keeping the audience laughing the whole time. You would think being so fast-paced would make this film feel messy and too much, but it gives the opposite effect, it keeps the audience engaged and wanting more. The character development is outstanding. Howard Hawks(director) could have not picked a better cast. The chemistry between the two main characters, Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, made them the perfect screen pair; everyone was routing for them. Also, Russell's character wasn't the average 1940's women, she was independent, playful, sexual, and one of the \"boys.\" This type of women was not the social norm, and seeing a powerful female lead excited people as well(mostly other women). The plot was original and quirky, the script was well-written and full of humor, and the music matched the energy of the film. Also, Hawks incorporated realistic sound effects throughout the film, which helped increase the quality of this film even more. Visually, the black and white photography was high quality and the camera work used a variety of angles and movement, with short scenes that had smooth transitions. On top of all the excellent effort, the movie had underlying messages through its humor and story line. Even though this film is upbeat and funny, many controversial issues are incorporated and joked about. These issues include: race, corruption, abuse of power(police, city hall), nepotism, politics, dealth penalty, and questions around privacy and freedom of speech. It's hard to believe all these serious issues are apart of the movies story and humor, but is it, and I think Hawks did that for a reason. These underlying messages are intense, he jokes about them, but he shines light on how these issues are apart of every day life and affect many peoples lives.Overall, out of all the movies I've had to watch for my History of America Cinema class, I enjoyed screwball comedy and His Girl Friday the most. I usually don't like old films, but this movie was hilarious and incorporated love and social issues. I think it is important for famous people to shine light on social issues because they have a large fan base and audience who watches their content and they can make people aware of these problems through entertainment. Sadly, famous people talking about these issues can make people care about these issues when they normally wouldn't care, but since their favorite famous does, they do. Celebrities can do a lot with their platform, so I really like when they give these underlying messages, while still giving the public amazing films, music, television shows, radio shows, books, magazines, etc.",

The play by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur was an instant hit and ran for 275 performances. It wasn't long until Hollywood got the script for a film, and the first celluloid edition came out in 1931. Leading stars of the day had the top roles. Adolph Menjou was Walter Burns and Pat O'Brien played Hildy Johnson. Most of the subsequent films stuck to the original cast of characters \u2013 with Hildy Johnson as a guy. But, Columbia Pictures got the idea of casting the ace reporter as a woman. With a change of the title to \"His Girl Friday,\" this film came out to be a smash hit at the box office. Cary Grant as Burns and Rosalind Russell as Johnson put more life and comedy into the story. Other versions followed later. One was a 1945 TV movie made by WNBT in New York City, but there couldn't have been many TV viewers in those days. Most sources peg the number of TV sets in America then at fewer than 10,000. A 1974 film with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau returned to the original two-male leads. It was spiced up some with language, but it clearly lacked the fire and excitement that Grant and Russell gave to the story in this 1940 film. The story underwent some other revisions for \"His Girl Friday,\" but the plot remained the same. The electricity and chemistry between Grant's Walter Burns and Russell's Hildy Johnson light up the screen. This is by far the best rendition of \"The Front Page\" story put on screen. The supporting cast are all superb as well. All of the versions of this story show a press that in the early 20th century was quite hard-boiled. It often pushed sensationalism over accuracy and journalistic integrity. That was supposedly due to the competition among papers for readers. New York City and Chicago each had four competing newspapers in 1940.",

Another is the story (the film) about the story (the report) about the story (the murder).It is a now common trick: make three layers instead of the normal two: in this case a passionately made story about a passionately made story. Then the more the characters invest in getting into their story, the more we invest into getting into ours. That's why we dig ourself into this freight train.Be aware that there is an offensive racist joke.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",

            "review_title": "breathless and magnificent comedy; one of Hawks's very best",
            "content": "The kind of work executed in His Girl Friday is no shorter than masterful; it should be a frenzy, a fiasco of dialog going and overlapping and reverberating and the pacing clocking in at ridiculous amounts at times (other times, oddly enough, it slows down just enough for us and the actors to catch respective breath). But Howard Hawks and his screenwriter Charles Lederer have the material down to a T. The film brilliantly interweaves a newspaper story that unfolds over the course of a day and night around a man who's to be (wrongfully) sentenced to death, and a love-triangle played out between Walter (Grant), Hildy (Russell) and Bruce (Bellamy), as Walter can't stand that his ex-wife is not only leaving the paper- which she's wildly amazing at as a writer and reporter- but for Albany insurance man Bruce Baldwin as new husband. He constructs an ingenious lot of tricks, mostly to put Bruce in jail, so that he can play on Hildy's ego to come back to the paper and, maybe, to him too. But it won't be easy.Hawks overcomes what could have been stagey picture- since it is based on a play, and feels it at times with its main set at the newspaper office- with what is first a true intuition to how to tell the story without getting in the way of a good conversation; sometimes going in three directions! It's not exactly a movie that brings out a whole lot of belly laughs; rather it's the accumulation of just solid chuckles, guffaws, and the occasional fall-on-the-floor moment that hit the best with characterization, behavior, mannerisms, manners. Matter of fact, it's extremely, keenly observed about how every character is who he/she is, and is fairly stuck in their ways, from the headstrong Hildy, the good but flabbergasted Bruce, his old mother, the \"I'm innocent!\" pleading man on death row, the Sheriff, the Mayor, the bunch of gruff and grizzled and card-playing newspaper men. But everyone's about as close to being, if not incredibly, fully realized, and there's barely a scene where someone doesn't say something, or repeat something, or refer or make some quip that doesn't get a laugh. This is how it's done, basically, in the best \"screwball\" style.Even Hildy, who seems to be completely set upon leaving the newspaper biz, isn't without moments of vulnerability that crack through her tough, Hawksian-exterior. And Russell, I should add, comes off a lot of the screen time stealing the show. While Grant is no sleepwalker and puts to work his skills at being charming and amusing while also playing a conniving persona, Russell puts everything she's got into a character that is probably far stronger than Bruce can take and is just about an even match for Walter Burns's double-crossing. Hell, she can even do a dramatic scene here or there, or make it so that she's right on the level with another actor (i.e. the one playing the death-row guy) so that comedy and drama come and go depending on the beat of the scene. It's breathtaking to watch her work, and it's likely her best performance (Grant, too, comes away with much of his screen time).Just make no mistake, this isn't a comedy that is based on the actors for most of the support. It's a wild combination of the pacing of the story, of the rat-tat-tat-tat style of overlapping and interweaving dialog (the likes of which one might see today on the TV show Gilmore Girls or, more cinematically, Altman) and that it never comes along as too rushed within the suspenseful narrative. And it floored me as being somewhat unique, and it only takes itself so much seriously in the world its set in so that it's always entertaining. If you're tuned into His Girl Friday, Hawks won't bore you for a second, and it's a mighty achievement.",

I figured that with that many people rating it favorably, it was bound to be a good movie. Wrong again! I found it to be incredibly stupid and completely unfunny, plus the rapid-fire dialog where everybody constantly talks over everybody else was extremely annoying. The Cary Grant character was a very mean person. I saw right away that he was what I would describe as a certain word that they probably won't let me say here but it begins with an a. The Grant character was dishonest and manipulative, and he did bad things. In real life, I would have had nothing to do with a person like this. Yet he is the one that we are supposed to think of favorably. Why? What does he have to recommend him? Absolutely nothing. He is a first-class jerk. I saw reviews calling this movie \"hilarious\" and \"incredibly funny.\" There was absolutely nothing funny about this movie, let alone hilarious. I guess some people think that a person doing mean things to an innocent person and trying to manipulate someone to do things to benefit him are hilarious. I happen to think that cruelty and injustice are not funny in the least. And things were done that made no sense. I couldn't understand why these people would do these things which in real life nobody would do. I watched the whole film, but I sure wish I hadn't wasted my life in so doing. Apparently there's no point in going by ratings. This movie got a higher rating than any other movie in the schedule, and yet it was awful.

            "content": "Ace reporter Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell) decides to give up the newspaper game for a 'normal' life with fianc\u00e9 Bruce Baldwin (Bellamy), a steady, if bland, insurance salesman from Albany, much to the chagrin of her boss and ex-husband, the conniving, abrasive editor Walter Burns (Cary Grant). Her matrimonial plans are quickly derailed by the escape of an alleged murderer who may have been set up by a corrupt mayor to court votes. An early example of gender swapping, the film is a romantic comedy adapted from Ben Hecht's play 'The Front Page' in which Hildy is a man. The film is famous for its rapid-fire dialogue and ad-libbing (including 'meta humour' such as Grant referring to Bellamy's character as looking like the actor Bellamy or referring to an 'Archie Leach', which was Grant's real name). The film was directed by Howard Hawks who deftly switches from character to character as Johnson and Burns bicker or while the rest of the reporters in the courthouse press room shout into their telephones as they compete for scoops. Led by the great comedy combination Grant and Russell, the entire cast is cast is excellent. Bellamy plays a similar 'sincere' counterpoint to a blustering Grant that he did in 1937's 'The Awful Truth' (and again is accompanied by his mother) and John Qualen, the character actor best known for faux Scandinavian roles, is Earl Williams, the 'killer' nebbish who Hildy is intent on saving from the gallows. The film is a product of its times, with references to a war in Europe, New York Mayor La Guardia, President Roosevelt, and the threat of 'Reds', (Hildy's proposed defense, an attempt to get William's declared insane, is that the shooting was an example of the Socialist tenant 'production for use'), but remains funny and relevant today (although the 'reporter as a hero' days are over, corrupt politicians are perennially fuel for satire). The comedy is quite black at times (especially Burns' response to the possible death of Bellamy's mother, whom he had abducted by his gangster side-kick 'Diamond Louie' (a funny Abner Biberman) to hide the secret of William's location) and the film has a bit of a nihilist feel at times (especially towards truth, love, and politics).

            "content": "I don't really like how this is categorized as a screwball comedy. There are certainly screwball elements, but it gets too somber for too long. The characters also are simply too composed and professional. The only thing that really lends itself to the screwball comedy aspect is the sheer speed that the characters speak. Hawks had become well known for his fast dialogue that he directed, most evident in his drama Ceiling Zero, but His Girl Friday takes this up to an almost ridiculous level. Add in the embrace of overlapping dialogue, and you've got one of the fastest talking movies ever made. I watched the first twenty minutes or so with my seven year old son just before his bedtime, and he asked, \"How do they talk so fast?\" \"Practice,\" was my response.Adapted from The Front Page co-written by Hawks' former writing partner, Ben Hecht (as well as Charles MacArthur), the screenplay written by Charles Lederer, His Girl Friday tells the story of a two newspapermen and the pending story of the execution of a white man accused of shooting a black police officer. The one major change to Hawks' adaptation is that Hildy Johnson went from a male to a female. Played by Jack Lemmon in Billy Wilder's adaption from 1974, Hildy is played by Rosalind Russell here (never once wearing the dress in the poster above because she's a newspaperman, not a socialite). She's on her way out of the newspaper business, marrying a nice man, Ralph Bellamy's Bruce Baldwin, despite the protestations of her former managing editor and husband, Cary Grant's Walter Burns. He turned her from a young no-nothing into an ace reporter, and he's indignant that she's leaving the business and him. In an amusing reversal from Bringing Up Baby, it's Grant who has a plan from the beginning to win over his female costar.This story about Earl Williams, the man under threat of execution by the state, is just too good of a story to let by. He was let go from his job of fourteen years as a bookkeeper, spent a quiet evening with a girl he met that day, and then ended up shooting a black police officer. There are questions about his mental state, but Earl Williams' well-being is as important to Walter Burns as Leo's health was to Chuck Tatum in Billy Wilder's Ace in the Hole. He's a story, and Burns is willing to get the exclusive on Williams' mental state and the end of his fight with the state no matter what it takes. He wants to be able to put up a headline that says that his newspaper, The Morning Post, saved Earl Williams' life, not because it will save a life but because it's just the goal of playing the newspaper game.And the newspaper game is addictive. Like the manager of a casino, Walter knows that all he has to do is get Hildy back into the game once and she'll be his again. It's not quite that simple, though. Hildy says she wants the normal life being married to an insurance salesman will entail, and she keeps trying to run to him. Walter gets her involved a little bit, she goes as far as the current high of activity will take her, and then she returns to earth, looking for her bag and her way out.The screwball elements are around the plotting of Walter keeping Hildy around. The promise to buy a large life insurance policy with a certified check, the hood he hires to plant a stolen watch on Bruce, and giving Bruce counterfeit money are all designed to keep Bruce from getting on the train out of town to Albany and, by extension, Hildy. As Bruce deals with all the setbacks that keeps him from the train, Walter distracts Hildy with the next step in finding the story. First is an interview with Earl Williams, where Hildy gains a personal perspective of the man that she wants to highlight in her writeup of the talk. After she tears up the paper to spite Walter for his continued torture of Bruce, she's ready to get out again.Everything turns around when Williams escapes from his last psychological examination (through the complete and comical ineptitude of the sheriff) and drops into the press room where Hildy has stayed behind as the rest of the newspapermen have gone out to investigate the jailbreak elsewhere. It's another jolt of excitement for her, and she quickly hides him in the desk with the help of the girl Earl had spent the night with, Mollie.This is where the movie turns somber as Earl Williams' plight comes to the fore for a solid chunk of time. There are still slapstick/screwball elements especially around Williams being inside the desk as things play out around him, but the overall tone is much more tense and serious than one might expect. A man's life being on the line really comes into focus, and I think it's important for how the movie's final moments play out.The governor of the state had sent a reprieve, and for political reasons the mayor had hidden that. The resolution revolves around Walter and Hildy figuring that out and using it to their advantage to take down a mayor and proclaim The Morning Post heroic. Removing oneself from the delirious fun of the fast moving dialogue and action, the opening text crawl that implies that everything we're about to see is representative of untoward behavior on the part of the press. It's about men (and a woman) who will do anything, say anything, and undermine anything in order to get a story before their competitors. This is the comedic version of Ace in the Hole.The dialogue is really rapid fire to the point that it's sometimes hard to hear. However, there's never a question about the overall point of conversation. The rapid fire nature of the delivery can make some of the witticisms difficult to discern, but never who wants what and why. This helps turn what probably should have been an hour and forty-five minute film into just over an hour and a half, making the movie feel like its constantly veering ahead, paced really, really quickly, and it's all done without many editing tricks. The movie is largely filmed in long shots that track the actors speaking quickly back and forth, only going into tightly edited moments at particular instances of intense action that use cross-cutting dialogue. This is an approach that I think more modern filmmakers could and should take. It's easier to appreciate the actors the longer we see them, and they get more time to play off of each other directly.And Grant and Russell play off each other wonderfully well. Encouraged to improvise, the two bounce witty dialogue back and forth in ways that make it obvious how they are both completely toxic for each other, especially Walter for Hildy, but also how they are a perfect match at the same time. It's a relationship that could never last, but they'll keep coming back to each other because they're addicted to the same thing, the newspaper business. They get the same highs and lows from chasing a great story, and any promise for a nice honeymoon at Niagara Falls is always doomed to failure because there will always be a strike to investigate.This movie is fast and entertaining from beginning to end, but it has a surprising amount of pathos to it centered on Earl Williams. That our main characters are completely unconcerned with him as anything other than a story gives them a nasty veneer that the fast nature of the movie largely glosses over, creating a subtext that adds an interesting layer to the action. On the surface, it's a fast, entertaining bit of newspaper business, but just underneath it's more savage. That, I think, is what really helps this version rise to greatness.",

            "content": "On Dutch television there was recently a filmprogram about sequels, prequels and remakes. I am particularly interested in remakes that are better than the original (which was also good because otherwise there wouldnt be a remake). \"His girl friday\", which is a remake of \"The front page\" (1931, Lewis Milestone) is a film in this category.The brilliant switch in \"His girl friday\" is to make one of the main characters a woman in stead of a man. The film thus becomes a \"screwball comedy\", one of the specialties of Howard Hawks. As in many screwball comedy's there is a relationship between a softy (in this case insurance agent Bruce Baldwin played by Ralph Bellamy) and a fierce lady (in this case star reporter Hildy Johnson played by Rosalind Russel), a relationship in which the woman clearly has the upper hand. In most of the films the woman, in spite of her initial spirit, marries the man and settles as a housewife.Not so in \"His girl friday\", where there is also an ambitious ex (Newspaper editor Walter Burns played by Gary Grant) who tries to win his wife back. He does everything to make his ex wife see that her current lover is much to tame for her. At the end he succeeds, something which the viewers had already anticipated after 10 minutes. Just like in \"When Harry met Sally\" (1989, Rob Reiner) Hildy Johnson and Walter Burns are destined for each other, and they are the only ones who do not see that right from the start. Not only does Hildy in the end choose agianst her softy, she also choose for her career. This makes \"His girl friday\" a sort of feminist screwball.Apart from a screwball comedy \"His girl friday\" is also a film about the newspaper industry. This industry is portrayed as rather cynical and reminds me of \"Ace in the hole\" (1951, Billy Wilder). Yes, municipal politcs is corrupt, but the journalists do not report on this to make the world a better place. They are only interested in their own scoops and their own careers.",

It is an anti-capital punishment movie which pretends to be a comedy. It's merely leftist Hollywood propaganda with a moronic plot, unlikable characters (except Bellamy's), and unfunny machine-gun-style line delivery; it would appear that the cast competed not in who would be funnier but who would say their lines fastest, resulting in a series of tediously fast \"blab-blab-blab\" verbal exchanges that are pathetically short on laughs.Then there are the numerous idiotic plot-devices, and various one-sided attempts to hammer in the point about the injustice of capital punishment. Bellamy getting repeatedly framed isn't funny: it's dull and stupid. The killer's girlfriend jumping out of the window is a mind-bogglingly dumb event, and only further proves that this is a political propaganda movie, first and foremost. And what's with the journalists all being middle-aged, bald, card-playing little weasels, with Russell sticking out ridiculously? Dumb, dumb, dumb. Typical old-movie nonsense.The writer's disdain for capitalism and authority is so strong that he didn't even give the killer a single line in which he expresses sorrow over having taken the life of another man; but because the victim is a cop we are supposed to not care about the \"accidental\" killing! Cary Grant has never been so unsympathetic as a character who was meant to be likable! The second half, in particular, is literally unwatchable.The film was made in the 40s, before McCarthy joined the celluloid fun and cleaned the house a bit.

And being voted #10 in Total Film's 100 Greatest Movies Of All Time list . Very good recounting about known story in which a beautiful woman reporter (Rosalind Russell , though Katherine Hepburn ,Carole Lombard, Joan Crawford , Ginger Rogers, Claudette Colbert , Irene Dunne turned down the character and whose role was based on the real-life a notorious reporter) wants to marry a young (Ralph Bellamy) but his mean editor (sympathetic and charming Gary Grant) impedes it . Rip-roaring vintage newspaper slapstick comedy and subsequently remade by Billy Wilder titled \u00a8The Front Page\u00a8; this 1940 retelling is the best one titled \u00a8His girl friend\u00a8 and with awesome acting from everyone . Cynical editor named Walter Burns (Gary Grant) wants to get a big scoop on an execution which involves convincing star reporter Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell who resented the fact that she wasn't the first choice to play Hildy for director and she then showed up to the audition with her hair wet from swimming) to come back to work and put off her marriage to handsome executive . Walter tries to keep him in town and break up her upcoming marriage takes place against the backdrop of a botched death row . Hildy can't resist covering some good news , even when it mean helping a condemned man (John Qualen) getaway the law as she attempts to help an innocent man is about to be executed . And the escaped convicted murderer offers the journalist an exclusive interview . Other reporters also give hilarious acting in this breathless pursuit of an exclusive with the escaped death row inmate .Great cast gives powerful performances as Gary Grant as a scheming publisher , Rosalind Russell as a convincing as well as impulsive journalist and Ralph Bellamy as an incautious boyfriend . Enjoyable play and screenplay from Ben Hecht , Charles MacArthur about a cunning managing editor of a known newspaper and his ambitious reporter . The journalists are all based on actual reporters who were Chicago colleagues of authors Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, with most working alongside them at the courthouse ; the real names were only slightly changed . Ben Hetch's brilliantly tart dialogue overlaps story to carry the black farce along the roller-coasted speed . Agreeable performance from attractive Rosalind Russell as ace journalist who wants to quit the business and get married , though Jean Arthur, the first choice by studio head Harry Cohn, turned down the role of Hildy Johnson because she and Howard Hawks had been cool to each other during the filming of Only angels have wings (1939) the year before . Likable Gary Grant as an editor who finds out his main reporter wants to leave him and gets in the way , though many critics in 1940 felt that Cary Grant was badly miscast as Walter Burns, and that Clark Gable would have been much better in the part . Inventive and furious screen combats in which Gary Grant and Rosalind Russell are given equal footing with staccato dialog and sparkling interpretations . Phenomenal playing from everyone , including a top-notch secondary cast such as Gene Lockhart , Porter Hall , Cliff Edwards , Regis Toomey , Abner Biberman , John Qualen and Helen Mack . Adequate photography by cinematographer Joseph Walker , being necessary an right remastering because of the film copy is worn-out and suffers the public domain . The only music is in the first and last two minutes of the film . Stunning direction by Howard Hawks renders more funny than usual , and achieved success enough . Rating : 7,5/10 . Worthwhile watching and premiere voted this movie as one of \"The 50 Greatest Comedies Of All Time\" in 2006. Other versions about this this frequent-told story are the followings : The play \"The Front Page\" opened at the Times Square Theater on August 14, 1929, and ran for 276 performances .

The story is not exactly and ingenious one, so it is really the charisma and obvious chemistry between the two leads that makes it run smoothly, and what made it a worthwhile viewing. My only true qualm with the movie, besides its rather dull story line was that Grant's character remains pretty one-dimensional. Right to the end he remains the hard yet charming \"newspaperman\" dedicated to a story over everything else. While the Russell's character does a 180 from a strong female lead, to one ready to fall into the arms of her obnoxious ex-husband; who in all honesty has done nothing to actually earn her affections.",

You have to see this one several times in order to get all the priceless dialogue, some of which overlaps, a phenomenon that hardly ever happens in movies from this era. Grant, Russell, and company are still funny sixty years later. This classic is one of the reasons I so often choose witty comedies over slapstick, ie, the Marx Brothers over Jerry Lewis.One of the little things I picked up on after repeated viewings is how Billy Gilbert, playing the guy with the governor's reprieve for Earl Williams, steals both scenes he is in. Gilbert can be seen in dozens of other movies in which he blows his stack, especially when he is working with Laurel and Hardy. Here, though, he hardly raises his voice at all, yet you watch his expressions when he is on screen with the other actors, and he becomes the center of attention without speaking a lot of dialogue.",

            "content": "Hildy Johnson is an ace reporter who has decided to throw in the sleazy newspaper game for a decent life. But when she comes to break the news to Walter Burns, her boss and ex-husband, he manages to drag her back into a fast-breaking story.If you like fast dialogue, this is the movie for you. The actors speak so fast you'll wonder if it's physiologically possible to do so. Based on Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's hit play The Front Page, it's an incredibly cynical but extremely funny story. Nobody is very interested in Williams the killer or the details of his crime, only in its context as relates to them. The reporters want a scoop, the Mayor and Chief want the black vote, the Governor wants to be popular, the girlfriend wants to be noticed, Hildy wants the rush from beating out everyone else. From my viewpoint it's a stinging indictment of newshounds (and as relevant as ever today) but Hawks was a pragmatist and he plays it as a nutty comedy as everyone scrambles over everyone else fishing for the best angle. Screwball comedies of sexual dynamics and goofy situations were big in the late thirties and early forties, with films like It Happened One Night, Bringing Up Baby or The Philadelphia Story, and stars like Grant, Katharine Hepburn and Carole Lombard made their reputations with them. If they have one major attraction, it's the leading ladies' potential to let rip and Russell does not disappoint, with a fantastic ear-chewing swaggering tour-de-force performance as she out-shouts and out-mugs a very funny Grant, a sort of acting equivalent of a headbanging hard rock guitar solo. Bellamy, as the hopelessly out-of-his-depth nice guy, heads a great support cast full of nutjobs (such as Billy Gilbert as the doofus delivering the pardon), all of whom are obviously having a whale of a time. And for me that's kind of the problem with this movie - they had so much of a blast making it, they didn't think what if the audience doesn't understand the plot and can't hear half the cracks. It's hilarious, but like Burns it's also so full of itself it doesn't know when to quit. Rhythm is key in movies and while ninety-miles-an-hour from start to finish is fun, for me it doesn't quite work. It's an unmissable classic though, if only to see Russell go at it and hear screenwriter Charles Lederer's crazy dialogue. There are several other film versions of this plot, notably the 1974 Billy Wilder straight adaptation of the play (in which the Hildy character is male), but this is the best and one of the sassiest comedies of its era.",

            "content": "His Girl Friday (1940)This is, in a way, another great 1939 film, filmed and copyrighted that year but not released until January 1940. But never mind that, His Girl Friday is maybe the best of that very cinematic genre, the screwball comedy. Oh, there are other great ones--My Man Godfrey and Bringing Up Baby, certainly, and two slightly less zany ones, Philadelphia Story and of course the one that started it all, It Happened One Night. But just listen to the perfect pitch writing and the even more perfect delivery by the two leads, the always astonishing Cary Grant and the even more astonishing Rosalind Russell. But wait, every single actor is on target here, and the delivery of every hilarious line is so compacted and intense, yet so brilliantly ordered and edited, you end up bowing down before the man pulling this all together, none other than Howard Hawks. Even the camera-work is fast and makes this chaos look completely reasonable, from the first scenes in the complicated newsroom to the later swirling scenes in the press room at the criminal building. Watch. And listen. If you can keep up.It probably helped just a little that the bugs were worked out of the screenplay here by the fact this began as a 1928 Ben Hecht stage play called The Front Page (in fact, one of the turning points has to do with soapbox politics that sound a decade out of date by 1939). This is also already a remake of the same play, under the original title (and this 1931 screwball prototype is quite amazing, too, though second fiddle to the Hawks version). Hawks and his screenwriter Charles Lederer updated the writing in other ways, though, mentioning the war in Europe, Hitler, and, for a big laugh, Grant's dimple. But if Cary Grant is already appreciated, Rosalind Russell needs to be remembered better. She had a number of terrific films, and she plays the smart strong woman perfectly. It's almost as though that kind of character became unpopular after the War, strong women taking the form of the mature Bette Davis or Joan Crawford instead, or any number of femme fatales (who are, you have to admit, strong). But Russell (see her Sister Kenny for starters) is fast, physically adroit, coy, and willing to take a joke.You'll probably want to see this movie twice, either twice in a row and again very soon. And you'll be amazed what you missed the first time, the kicks under the table (several), or the innuendoes (straight and gay both), and the straight up funny comebacks. Hold on to your hats!",

Why any woman would want to be married to such a jerk in the first place is beyond me. Add in a ludicrous subplot (a pathetic clod, convicted, possibly unjustly, of murder must be hanged in the morning so the mayor and local sheriff can be reelected in three days). Yeah.

            "content": "I seem to find myself coming under the \"Yes, but...\" camp on this one; yes, I enjoyed the film, but I didn't love it. Nor would it find a place in my personal pantheon of classics.Part of my problem is that Walter Burns is apparently intended to be secretly attractive by dint merely of being played by Cary Grant -- at least, he never does or says anything in the course of the screenplay that would otherwise give him any appeal. Burns will lie, cheat, double-cross and murder (at least, shrug off the supposed death of an old lady without a qualm) in order not merely to get a 'story' but simply to get his own way, and by the end of the film I was hoping for nothing so much as to see him get what was coming to him; no such luck. In the original \"The Front Page\" (which, like this, was good but not superlative), the no-holds-barred relationship between (male) Hildy and Burns made sense in the rougher male-bonding context; seemingly, I'm the only viewer who finds it rather less credible transplanted into the context of a love affair. I can't swallow the psychology of the ending at all -- it seems to come out of nowhere, or rather, out of arbitrary movie convention.But then, that's screwball comedy, which I suspect is the other part of my problem with the film. Screwball comedy has always struck me as the verbal equivalent of slapstick: personally, if Katherine Hepburn were to smash the dinosaur skeleton I'd just spent months reconstructing, I wouldn't find that a rationale for falling in love with her either...It's interesting seeing this picture after seeing \"The Front Page\" first. Although I wouldn't have said I had any clear visual recollection of the earlier film, certain setups -- such as the press-room overlooking the courtyard -- are instantly familiar. And \"His Girl Friday\" very clearly shows their joint stage origins in the way that almost all the actual action takes place off-screen; characters rush in and start telling each other all about what's just happened, or start delivering exposition over the telephone, but the entire story more or less takes place on three indoor sets, and the vast majority of it in a single room.Rosalind Russell makes a credible female news-hound (although the way that her middle-aged male counterparts treat her exactly as they treated male Hildy is a little incongruous -- 'one of the boys' or not, they don't even seem to notice she's female), and she displays an impressive range in the course of this film. The unmistakable features of Cliff Edwards can be spotted among her fellow reporters, and Helen Mack brings a darker note with her hectic portrayal of Mollie Malloy, victim of tabloid journalism. I'm not a tremendous fan of Cary Grant, and I was less impressed with him here that I have been elsewhere. The weak and corrupt elected officials, however, were beautifully judged, and Billy Gilbert shines as the emissary too stupid to be effectively bribed.The film is a fast-talking black satire on journalism and the US justice system, and thus far it admirably succeeds. It's also trying to be a screwball romantic comedy, and this aspect I find less convincing.My IMDb rating: seven. Worth seeing, worth recommending; not worth putting yourself to discomfort for.",

His ace reporter is also his ex wife, Hildy (Rosalind Russell) who has turned up with her new intended Bruce (Ralph Bellamy) a lowly, kindhearted but a bit of a doofus insurance salesman from Albany. Hildy wants to settle down as a housewife away from the rat race of journalism.Walter does not want to let her go either professionally or privately and resorts to all sorts of chicanery to stop her from leaving with Bruce. However a prisoner in death row could be just the story that pulls back Hildy to cover one last big story.The film is daring for its time with its political overtones, the newspaper which Walter edits is Democrat leaning, anti capital punishment and dislikes the Republican Mayor and Governor widely hinted as being crooked and holding back the city.The film is also self deprecating, when Walter is asked to describe Bruce, he replies a bit like Ralph Bellamy! Walter also mentions that incident involving Archie Leach.The film goes at a cracking place and stays that way, it gets convoluted as the prisoner from death row escapes and Hildy's life gets increasing frantic as Bruce keeps getting arrested for incidents set up by Walter.Cary Grant does well to make the conniving Walter almost likable but and charming you do think that the man is as corrupt and self serving as the Mayor, Governor and the police chief he so despises.Hildy on the other hand is a born and bred journalist mixing it in the tough male dominated world (the so called 'wage slaves') of crime journalism and scoops. You do wonder what she exactly sees in Bruce and why does she want a quiet life?The film hangs well over seven decades later and is rightly regarded as a classic.",

            "content": "Utilizing one of the greatest screenplays ever written for a film, this update of \"The Front Page\" takes on a feminine twist as the male \"Hildy\" of the play becomes the ex-wife of fellow reporter Walter, quitting to go get married to the boring insurance salesman in Albany of all places. All Manhattan newspaper offices should be located between a jailhouse yard with a hanging platform right outside the window, with a schoolhouse appropriately placed on the other side. Just the thought of this sends off a ton of cynical laughs in the hard-brittle world of journalism which almost 90 years after the original play still remains as intense and biting as it did back in the late 1920's. Hildy is Rosalind Russell, the tough-talking journalist who has a true knack for getting the story, and her ex-husband Walter is the fast- talking Cary Grant. If you gave him a nickle for every scheme he succeeded in to either get a story or get a reporter to do what he wanted them to do, he could retire from the business. Here, he's not amused to find out that his wife is getting out of the business to settle down with the staid Ralph Bellamy. Grant gets on his high horse extremely fast in order to prevent the two from leaving town, and in one call, amusingly describes Bellamy's mild-mannered Bruce Baldwin as looking like a certain movie actor. Even more amusing is his first meeting with Russell's fianc\u00e9e, whom he pretends to assume to be a very old man at their pending introduction.Every detail of this screenplay is A+++. The gentlemen of the press are all preparing for the upcoming execution of Earl Williams (a marvelous John Qualen), the pathetic out-of-work milquetoast who got a little too excited and accidentally killed a cop. Grant wants Russell to get Qualen's last interview, and through various means of manipulation, manages to succeed. This, he knows, will get Russell's journalistic juices flowing and will prevent her from leaving either his employ or as he hopes, his bedside. Veteran actress Helen Mack plays the tough-as-nails Mollie who showed off a heart of gold when she allowed Qualen into her room one night and did nothing but listen to him repeat his sob story to her. Now, she's got a reputation, and as the time for Qualen's execution approaches, wants to get her last word in with the reporters whom she accuses of manipulating the situation just to get a good story.While the story definitely has its tragic moments, there's a cynical edge of comedy here, and the writers are obviously utilizing this as an attack on the power of the press which is still often abused. Grant hysterically demands that that pesky war in Europe be taken off the front page for the newest developments in the Earl Williams case which is now a bed of a political battle between the local sheriff (Gene Lockhart), the mayor (Clarence Kolb) and the unseen governor. A veteran cast of famous character performers fill out the parts of the other reporters, from Porter Hall and Cliff Edwards, to Alma Kruger as Bellamy's outraged mother. Billy Gilbert is a riot as a messenger from the governor's office, and Marion Martin is fun as one of the elements of Grant's schemes against the engaged couple.So few films hit pure and absolute perfection, and \"His Girl Friday\" is one that comes out to be even better than its excellent original, filmed ten years before with an all-star cast equivalent to this one. Remakes of both versions (one updated to a television newsroom) weren't bad, but placid when compared to these two films. As social comedy with elements of drama and tragedy involved, this hasn't been beaten, even by Frank Capra at his finest. Grant and Russell are as outstanding a movie couple as there ever has been, and Bellamy, who has had his share of leads, has never been better here as he is as the mild-mannered clod who has no idea of what he's up against. The excellent direction by Howard Hawks helps keep everything together and he is aided by excellent work by the photography and editing team.",

I hadn't seen this for about 10 years until tonight but remembered all the peppy back-chat perfectly \u2013 the effect a truly Great film has on me.Feisty female journalist Hildy Johnson refreshingly played by Rosalind Russell is trying to leave town to go to Albany with her future staid husband, who looked like Ralph Bellamy, gets ambushed by her ex-husband/editor Walter Burns on the trail of a hot crime story and hammed up for all he was worth by Cary Grant. Over the course of the film we realise even if she doesn't that she still has the fire of investigative journalism in her blood, so the outcome should be pretty obvious to all. The dialogue is breakneck, witty, cynical, and clever. Would it be remade now with everyone feverishly texting or bellowing into their mobiles? Favourite bits: the marvellous opening 14 minute section story-setting interchange in the Tribune's offices between Russell and Grant \u2013 a masterclass; Bellamy's face at the police station reporting he'd been accused of \"mashing\"; the peremptory treatment by Louis of Mother in the press-room; so many others it's impossible to separate all the quick-fire one-liners. Two slight downers though: usually nice guy John Qualen hiding in the bureaux (surely not it's intended production for use?) slowed it down and introduced a clownish element to the proceedings; also the film's treatment of him and his problems seemed as cavalier and callous as was the newspapermen's \u2013 literally no one except Mollie cared. Mayor Kolb & Sheriff Lockhart actively promoting his murder was laughed off. I never knew why Hugh Herbert's face had been drawn on the wall above the bureaux \u2013 by a really bored newspaperman I suppose.The film takes no sides on the utter cynicism and corruption shown and it also helps me realise that phone hacking for information by journalists must have been standard practice for decades by now. A fantastic production for use, showing how good olde Hollywood could be.",

Rosalind Russell may not be a well-known actress today, but her Hildy Johnson steals the show. And Ralph Bellamy's Bruce Baldwin is also quite nice.What makes this film great? Well, besides being a good story, it is full of in-jokes and back-and-forth lines so fast it is almost hard to hear them all. When Grant refers to Baldwin as looking like Ralph Bellamy, that is hilarious. Or references to Archie Leach (his real name), among others.Russell talks so fast that she could sell Micro Machines. The way her and Grant go back and forth is just funny by itself, in the way the dialogue is delivered. Maybe not as witty as the Marx Brothers, but the pace evokes their humor.I was a bit surprised to find this is one of Quentin Tarantino's favorite films (he has lifted lines from it in \"True Romance\" and \"Kill Bill\"), but after watching it I find it hard to believe that anyone could not consider this to be a masterpiece of its era, if not still today.",

He doesn't want to lose her so must think quickly. His first move is to persuade her to do one last story; a report on a man who is due to hang at seven o'clock the next morning. He also does everything he can to ensure she can't catch her train... including playing some very low tricks on her fianc\u00e9. As the reporting of the impending execution progresses the film turns its sights on incompetent police, corrupt politicians and a media that isn't too concerned about accuracy when sensationalism sells more papers.Next year this film will be eighty years old but it still feels remarkably fresh largely thanks sparkling performances from Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell as Walter and Hildy. While the comedy is fairly screwball at times the central story still feels fresh... it would only take a few tweaks to create a modern remake; not that I'd want that. The dialogue is mostly delivered at breakneck speed that captures the urgency of the reporters. I liked the fact that one of our leads has a less than perfect character; Walter is particularly devious but even when he is at his most conniving he is likeable. Overall I'd definitely recommend this comedy for anybody wanting a good laugh with minimal offensive material.",

            "content": "A few weeks ago I reviewed one of Grant's earlier projects with director Howard Hawks called Bringing Up Baby and completely despised it. It was annoying, unfunny, and the timing was completely moldy. Well, maybe Hawks learned from his mistakes because His Girl Friday was the direct opposite. While in Baby I thought that Grant and Hepburn made a horrific team whom couldn't play off each other, in this film Grant's chemistry with Rosalind Russell is impeccable. They both know timing and they both are able to keep up with each other. Both have their characters developed and understood so even if there was some ad lib mixed in with the script, we wouldn't know because they are able to playfully compete with each other on screen. The story is rather dark, surprisingly, which keeps the viewer attracted to the themes and plot, which unfolds with lightning speed in front of us. You have the sensation that Hawks felt comfortable with this film, the challenges and the actors unlike the outcome of Bringing Up Baby. Everyone involved seems to be on top of their game providing yet another memorable chapter in \"screwball comedy\" history.I must say that originally my impression of Cary Grant was not a desirable one. My first film viewed in which he stars did not leave a great taste in my mouth, but thankfully he was able to counter with this film. Grant seemed born to play Burns, and I wonder if it wasn't more comforting for him. He seemed relaxed in this role, familiar with his mannerisms, and completely in control. His ability to be constantly above 100% in each scene we watch was impressive, but what I found most enjoyable was Rosalind Russell's performance. She matched what Grant had and raised it even higher. You could not keep your eyes off her as she controlled every scene she was involved with. Her ability to be stronger than the male characters, and honestly smarter, was impressive for a film made in the 1940s. This was a strong woman doing a man's job, and I wouldn't be surprised if Hawks wasn't trying to tell us something here. While the ending of the film didn't seem to fit as well as the rest of the film with Russell, she was so charismatic, so charming, and so innocent, that you could not help but root for her during the entire run. She captured you and never let you go! While the characters did create this film and keep you laughing constantly, the story wasn't shabby either. It was actually a very dark story, darker than I anticipated a film starring Cary Grant would be. Here you have a newspaper conglomerate that has the power to sway the decisions of Governors, to take sides in public matters, to cohort with evildoers and still remain at the top of their game. While I do believe Hawks was trying to recreate the reality of such a fast paced work environment, I couldn't help but wonder if he wasn't speaking even on broader terms. Did he hold some animosity towards the media? Did Hawks think that perhaps the media was swaying the public's image away from the truth? One scene that I thought was sheer brilliance was when Molly Malloy (Helen Mack) arrived in the press room frantically yelling about how the newsmen smeared the truth throughout the paper. It was so bad that she herself couldn't remember what really happened. It seemed that every word that came from Molly's mouth was twisted into a new, far-fetched story. It was similar to a game of telephone. The truth may be staring you in the face, but when it reaches the end of the line, it may be something completely different. I think Hawks was trying to tell us something. Even when Molly finally reaches her climactic scene, you cannot help but wonder if she doesn't represent a part of Hawks, or the entertainment industry, or anyone hurt by the media. Inside this \"screwball comedy\" was something deeper and very disturbing.Overall, I was impressed with this film. I loved the language of the characters. I love the way that Cary Grant embodied this manipulative man who got everything he reached out for. Beware those thinking that this is a feminist film, while there may be a very strong central female character, the smarter Grant constantly undermines her. The ending was the only part of this film that I had trouble dealing with. While Hawks was trying desperately to drive a point home, it just seemed choppier than the rest of the film. The ending felt rushed and completely bland. I needed a stronger structure, but was extremely happy with the rest of the film. This was an amazing feature, for both the creative and charismatic characters that were painted onto the screen, but also with the hidden themes that Hawks threw in between jokes. I found myself laughing and thinking at the same time. This truly was one of those films that was released well before its time.Grade: **** out of *****",

So much has already been written by others in the IMDb reviews about this marvelous film treasure that I have only one additional comment. To me the funniest scenes in the movie, which I have seen now at least a dozen times, are the ones with Billy Gilbert as the confused but honest Joe Pettibone. Billy Gilbert's only other film roles that even came close to this one were when he played opposite Laurel and Hardy in \"County Hospital\" and \"The Music Box.\" It's a shame that Cary Grant never received an Oscar (except for the 1970 Honorary Oscar). He certainly deserved one for \"His Girl Friday.\" This is also a shining role for Rosalind Russell. The many supporting players match the leads in their adroitness. Though this movie has been remade several times and was itself a remake to some extent, none of the copies come close to a match. Watch and savor.",

            "review_title": "So where exactly were the jokes?",
            "content": "His Girl Friday is a screwball \"comedy\" about a talented newspaper reported named Hildy Johnson trying to escape the newspaper business and her duplicitous taint of an ex-husband Walter Burns. Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant play our leading actors, and actually do a very good job. They move at a fast pace, turn their roles into unique feeling characters, and do, for the most part, have a good chemistry (until the very ending). The film is generally well acted all around, but this is where my praise of the film will be coming to a screeching halt. This film has left me fairly confused, and that confusion has turned into a chafing irritation the more I look back and contemplate what exactly I had watched. The root of my confusion stems from the genre this film is labeled under. According to everything I've seen this is a screwball comedy, but I don't understand how a film should qualify as a comedy just because we have an odd couple butting heads throughout what is in all other aspects a crime drama. Despite the way this relationship clashes with the narrative of the film, it does manage some good moments. About 1/3rd of the way into the film we follow Hildy as she covers the story of a man facing the death penalty for the of shooting a police officer. She visits the jail where he's being held to interview him through the bars of his cell in a way I found very reminiscent of the interview scenes in Capote. She meets with a women grief stricken over her friend's impending execution, and cleverly records her lamenting of the situation. This aspect of the film progresses in a very enjoyable way, and if it was separated from the sort of broken love triangle type deal we have to suffer through otherwise it would have been very good, but it deals a pretty devastating blow to the screwball comedy aspect of the film by becoming far too dark and dramatic. It ends in a suicide and the capture of the man accused, who will now certainly be facing an execution. How does this have any place in a comedy? It really doesn't at all. This brings us to the odd couple/screwball aspect of the film. The parts that really dragged this film into a deep, dark grave for me. This portion of the narrative centers around Hildy's impending marriage to an all around nice, trusting man named Bruce Baldwin, played by Ralph Bellamy. A guy that could very easily give Hildy exactly what she claims to really want out of life after her plan to leave reporting for good. Upon hearing of her engagement, Walter immediately starts scheming, lying, stealing, cheating, and tormenting his way into their lives in the hopes of splitting them up. He tells Hildy all about how much he wishes they could get re- married, but she quickly rebukes him with all of the many valid complaints she had about his treatment of her as his wife. Throughout the course of the film Walter ends up getting Bruce arrested and sent to jail on three separate occasions, and Hildy really has very little problem with all of this, and in the end, Hildy goes from being engaged to Bruce one minute to planning her re-marriage to Walter, her complete scumbag of an ex, the very next. This movie has to have one of the absolute worst, most ridiculous and completely forced endings I've ever seen. It sloppily ties (most) of the loose ends from the crime drama narrative together in a crusty meat sack of an abomination unto film in the very last two minutes, then has Hildy and Walter holding each other tenderly and planning their coming honeymoon only for it to devolve into exactly what caused them to divorce in the first place. I get that this is supposed to be outlandish and funny, but it is so completely straight out of left field and absurd that it just becomes insulting. Why would Hildy ever agree to this, let alone think it's a good idea? The world will never know. And how did I miss every single laugh in this film? Because they didn't exist.",

The witticisms and insults come flying so fast and furious that it's impossible to catch it all, especially with so many of the actors speaking roughly at the speed of light. (No doubt that this is the kind of comedy that improves with each viewing.) That may make it hard for some viewers to make a lot of sense out of it all, but the film still benefits from high energy and a blazing pace. It barely allows its audience to catch its breath!Cary Grant is hilarious as Walter Burns, a conniving sleaze ball who works as editor for the Morning Post newspaper. His ace reporter and ex-wife, Hildy Johnson (gorgeous Rosalind Russell), announces her intention to leave the business behind and marry insurance man Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy). This he WILL not allow to happen, coming up with assorted schemes to put monkey wrenches into her plans. And all of this while a breaking story about a pathetic cop killer (John Qualen), who's set to be executed very soon, occupies much of their time.The cast couldn't be better, in a yarn in which the news media take a serious drubbing. They're portrayed as ruthless, cynical, and willing to do almost anything in order to \"get the story\". (The opening disclaimer does read that the screenplay doesn't necessarily bear a resemblance to real life, although in THIS day and age, it's often easy to believe the worst about some characters in this line of work.) The stars are extremely easy to watch, and are backed up by a constant stream of superior character actors: Gene Lockhart, Porter Hall, Ernest Truex, Cliff Edwards, Clarence Kolb, Roscoe Karns, Frank Jenks, Regis Toomey, Abner Biberman, Frank Orth, Alma Kruger, Billy Gilbert, etc. The pretty Helen Mack has a memorable role as a sad-sack woman whose heart has gone out to the doomed Earl Williams (Qualen).Hawks' style has transferred between the films in his resume, with actors BARELY waiting for co-stars to finish speaking before barking out their reams of dialogue. As this viewer already said, it makes the film run the risk of being incoherent, but overall everything is so fresh and funny that it makes \"His Girl Friday\" quite entertaining to watch.Filmed again in 1974, and updated to the satellite television era in 1988 as \"Switching Channels\".Eight out of 10.",

They can't sit still, all the time determined to gel the wheels of their countless devices and schemes into action. This has to be the most urbane film of the classic screwball comedies, Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, both in their very top comic form, playing a tough, cynical editor and a star reporter with their ears forever to the ground and their fingers on the pulse of fashionable social drifts and developments. The ideal insiders, they gain access to whatever scene, privileged or specialized that occur to their whims: Russell forming chummy alliances, Grant ringleading, and ever living by their own arrays of convention. They have the souls and mouths of a Dashiell Hammett or an Allen Ginsberg from an older generation, so they have gravitated toward media-driven vocations, those steeped in the commercial exchange of ideas, which brings them into contact with an ever-revolving cast of characters. In scarce flashes of downtime, they still pine for activity, painting the town red with cliquey associations.Hawks can step to one side and psychologically react to things from both slants at once. He grasps impressions and information, simultaneously conveying his own messages and agenda. Interaction is what it's all about for Hawks, a master of commerce, communication, and all such exchange.Russell traverses a thin edge between inherent liability and an uncompromising need to claim her own agenda both professionally and in her personal life. She is very conscious of her womanly charm, utilizing them to her best benefit, playing coy or bright so as to win the affection of men and win position. No other woman around her generates more commotion. Russell does not play a laid-back or even very considerate character, her presence running entirely on nervous energy. She's able to gain the greatest triumphs on top of finding herself in the severest predicaments. She puts everything into keeping count of any ambition.I'm stunned to find that Russell herself is not as iconic as this character of hers, if not cyclonic: She leaves every situation, and every person involved, tainted following her involvement. When it comes to her regretted past marriage to Grant, she had thrown herself into the situation the same way she does with all of them, out of an alternating need to indulge desire and impose dominance, letting herself be swept away by curiosity. Now however, much to the chagrin of Grant, she is touching down and planning to settle into an accepting marriage with Ralph Bellamy, as always playing a meek, bland cornball romantic, with whom she may safely swing between her two distinct personalities, helpless baby doll and ruthless boss.Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, who wrote the original play, and more immediately the screenwriter Charles Lederer, are acutely cognizant of mental mechanics. They think, and they are masters of mind games, for the sake of our amusement as well as putting the wheels of the lightning-paced plot in motion and pulling out all the stops too, but the incidental appearance of a hilariously reactive and zealous fat man. His Girl Friday is undoubtedly one of the greatest comedies ever made.",

In fact, as a newspaper reporter, Hildy Johnson shows her own seamy side as she leads convicted killer Earl Williams (John Qualen) down a questionable path with her line of inquiry. That whole 'production for use' business left me more than a little confused.For her part, Russell reminded me a little of Martha Raye from that frenzied scene when she was getting ready to take off on her honeymoon with Bob Hope in \"Never Say Die'. Here you've got Hildy all full of vim and vinegar ready to charge after that jail break story, with Williams' life hanging in the balance. In the mean time, fianc\u00e9e Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy) falls victim to all of Walter Burns' (Grant) machinations, which you know he's done time and time again with other poor schleps. Can you imagine if Burns had ambition in law or politics - he would have easily eclipsed those two paragons of incompetence, Sheriff Hartwell (Gene Lockhart) and Mayor Fred (Clarence Kolb). By the way, when did New York City ever have a sheriff?If you're paying too much attention to the story, you might be put off by the whole 'colored cop killing' that's making the 'Morning Post' headlines in the story. Team that up with Molly Molloy's (Helen Mack) suicide leap and you have a queasy denouement that makes the story something of a downer. Kind of makes you wish the paper were covering something a little more upbeat.If you like the kind of energy the movie generates, it would probably be worthwhile to take in a second viewing for all the lines that whizzed by the first time around. In my case, I missed the 'Archie Leach' reference. But give Columbia Pictures credit for allowing one of the funniest lines to remain in the picture. When Walter has small time hood Louie's moll tail Baldwin, she asks him what he looks like. The response - \"He looks like, uh, that fella in the movies - you know, uh, Ralph Bellamy.\" - Beautiful!!",

Based on the stage play The Front Page (written by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur), His Girl Friday was actually the second cinematic adaption of this story (the first being the 1931 film also titled The Front Page). Director Howard Hawks made an excellent choice in changing the lead role of Hildy to a female character instead of male, as originally written. This decision not only allowed Rosalind Russell the opportunity to give a career-best performance, but set the foundation for this version to take a romantic turn by allowing our two leads (Russell and Cary Grant) to fall back in love (they were once married). It also gives us one of the earliest film depictions of a woman with a successful career. Russel's character is a force to be reckoned with, as she goes toe-to-toe with every male colleague in her no-holds-barred approach in a competitive newsroom. Filled with not-so-subtle jabs at the ethics and morals (or lack of) that the world of journalism is scrutinized for (still relevant today), this comedy has much more to say than most films of the era. The rapid fire dialogue is spoken at whiplash speed, so only a careful listener will catch the many thought provoking statements, especially since so many of them are not directly spoken. Truly one of the funniest films ever made, Russell and Grant shine in their roles. Intensely physical, the comedy here is at master level and both stars deliver some of their best work. There is an intoxicating quality to this film, mesmerizing audiences with the high energy of every moment on screen, matched with perfectly choreographed staging (it makes you wonder how much rehearsal went into every scene). This is a film that has stood the test of time, still revered by audiences and actors alike. It's influence is apparent in most American sitcoms and even classic television shows such as Gilmore Girls (this movie is referenced in episodes of it supporting my theory that show creator Any Sherman-Palladino found it inspiring). His Girl Friday is often referred to as the quintessential classic comedy. Watching it you will certainly agree with its earned legacy in the world of cinema.",

She breaks her good news to Walter Burns (Cary Grant), both her former editor and ex-husband, with the intention of giving up the newspaper game and living a simple and normal life, but most of all, being as far away from her ex-husband as possible. After meeting and dining with both Hildy and her future husband-to-be, Walter plots to keep Hildy under his employ by assigning her to the Earl Williams case. Earl Williams (John Qualen), an unemployed bookkeeper, is accused of shooting a policeman, and has already been tried and found guilty of the crime and to soon face execution by hanging. Hildy is to grant the newspaper an interview with him before he dies, and make this her final story for the paper. Putting their train trip to Albany on hold for a few hours, Hildy does the interview while Walter works every unthinkable scheme to do away with both Bruce and his mother (Alma Kruger). In the meantime, Sheriff Peter Hartwell (Gene Lockhart) and the mayor (Clarence Kolb) do whatever possible keeping Joe Pettibone (Billy Gilbert) from delivering Earl's reprieve for their own political gain in the upcoming election. Also in the cast are: Porter Hall (Murphy); Cliff Edwards (Elliott); Regis Toomey (Sanders); Roscoe Karns (McCue); Frank Jenks (Tim Wilson); and Ernest Truex (Roy V. Bensinger, poet), as press room reporters at the Criminal Court Building; Abner Biberman (\"Diamond Louie\"); Frank Orth (Duffy); Marion Martin (Evangeline); and Helen Mack (Mollie Malloy), among others.While \"His Girl Friday\" basically follows the plot elements closely to both play and original motion picture, it certainly holds its own from start to finish as something quite original. The first 15 minutes of the story is certainly priceless comedy, showing both Grant and Russell at their comic-timing best. Yes, there are some moments of serious emotions involved, including Mollie's (Helen Mack) tearful emotions towards the condemned man she feels to be innocent for his crime; or John Qualen holding Hildy hostage in the press room at the hold of a gun. Even with these dramatic scenes, the story moves at a fast pace before reaching its 92 minute climax. Ralph Bellamy, who's no stranger playing the naive mother's boy he initially enacted in THE AWFUL TRUTH (Columbia, 1937) which also featured Cary Grant, offers more of the same here for his record. Before Bing Crosby and Bob Hope's \"Road to\" comedy series over at Paramount, HIS GIRL Friday does have its share of in-joke humor incorporated into the story, the most famous being Walter's description of Bruce Baldwin looking like that movie actor named Ralph Bellamy. Be sure to hear what Cary Grant has to say about some guy named \"Archie Leach!\"The plot was later reworked as a musical titled THE THRILL OF BRAZIL (Columbia, 1946) featuring Keenan Wynn in the Walter Burns-type characterization, with Evelyn Keyes and Ann Miller in support. Later reverted back to its original title of THE FRONT PAGE, the latest 1974 Universal edition retained its original play structure of the late twenties, featuring Walter Matthau (Walter Burns) and Jack Lemmon (Hildy Johnson) in the cast. \"His Girl Friday\" was revamped once more in plot and script structure as SWITCHING CHANNELS (Tri-Star, 1988) starring Kathleen Turner, Burt Reynolds and Christopher Reeve, switching the setting from news room to television station.For \"His Girl Friday,\" it became one of the many public domain movie titles displayed on video cassette by various distributors in the early 1980s, as well as being most televised on television either on commercial, public or cable channels (namely American Movie Classics or Turner Classic Movies). Once seen, \"His Girl Friday\" regardless of its age, remains an instant classic of screwball newspaper comedies of Hollywood's golden age. -30- (***1/2)",

Mostly its the same thing over and over and by the time 'action' has moved to the smaller press room, I'm losing interest. Grant is fine and Russell goes at it well enough in similar vein. It all gets less amusing and more annoying. The stagey play being enacted out turns to farce. Slapstick farce and I'm reflecting just how much better this might have been without all the frantic phone calls and brickbats. Or maybe not.

The restored version on DVD is very nice, and includes a very interesting 28-minute 'extra' on Cary Grant's career, including clips from many of his most popular roles.SPOILERS follow for my own recollection -- he has not seen her in about 4 months, still longs for her, finds out she is about to marry an honest but dull insurance salesman from Albany, NY. Intent on spoiling the wedding and winning her back, he throws in several deceptions, including a hooker and some counterfeit cash, both of which land the intended groom temporarily in jail. Meanwhile she is doing an interview and article on a convicted murderer who claims he is innocent, a jail-break occurs, they hide the convict in the roll-top desk, police show up, but a pardon is granted, and in the end Grant and Russell plan to get married again, and take a real honeymoon, to Niagra Falls.",

            "content": "\"The Front Page\" (or variations thereupon) has been filmed many times, but Howard Hawks's gender-altering take on the classic newspaper comedy is far and away the fastest, funniest, and most memorable. It's \"gender-altering\" because Hildy Johnson, here played by Rosalind Russell, was a man in the stage version (and Pat O'Brien in Lewis Milestone's 1931 filming). Luckily Hawks resisted the urge to turn Hildy into one of his strangely glib and yielding heroines (see assorted Hawks dames played by Lauren Bacall and Joanne Dru), and Russell's witty and tough-minded Hildy has (or should have) served as a primary role model for several generations of working women.\"His Girl Friday\" is loaded with great \"in\" jokes about Archie Leach (Grant's original moniker) and how the Ralph Bellamy character resembles Ralph Bellamy, and it has a wonderfully spontaneous quality that was very rare in '40's films. The only thing I'd quibble with is that at moments, at least in the raucous context of the rest of the story, the Grant-Russell romance feels a wee bit mushy and out of place.Note to the next (inevitable) guy who's thinking of redoing \"The Front Page\": Why not go back to Milestone's Ur-version (no romance, no sentimentality) and keep Hawks's inspired sex change?",

Nothing is shown to indicate even the tiniest reason for her to change her mind about a finalized DIVORCE. Cary Grant is completely and criminally unsympathetic, and that is bad news for the lead in a romantic comedy.Tone problems. It's a comedy with dramatic moments that aren't the least bit funny.

I didn't quite care for Walter Burns, but I think that was Howard Hawks intention. Although during that time period women were trying to rise in the work force, it wasn't for everyone. Or even if it was, many women still wanted a family. Hildy felt mistreated by Walter and I agreed with her decision to get a divorce. Now she found a great guy, a gentleman which can be hard to find, and she wanted to marry him. She wanted someone who showed they cared about her. Then it went downhill for me. The viewer could see the passion in her face about journalism, Rosalind Russell did a very good job expressing her character, but it was possible to do this if she moved to Albany as well. But in the end Hildy and Walter hurt Baldwin and his mother, and neither of them had any remorse for what they did. The ending wasn't one I enjoyed, and I turned out very much disliking Hildy.Putting the plot aside, I think this was a very well representation of how press got their news, fake or not. They didn't have the technology that we have today, and they had to do a lot more footwork than they do today. It also showed how some were passionate about this and wants to get the truth, good or not out, and then you saw next to them how they didn't care if the story was real or not, just as long as it was good. Mixed in was a little bit of politics which holds true for today as well, that there are some corrupt politicians out there and only look out for themselves. I give this movie a 6 out of 10, because it was well made, but I didn't particularly like how the good guy got the short straw.",

            "content": "One of the finest examples of 1930s comedy, and an excellent adaptation of a story that has been told many times, *His Girl Friday* is Hollywood at its best. Perfectly pairing Grant and Russell with an excellent script by Charles Lederer, based on Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's 1931 play, *The Front Page*, it is the kind of studio magic that could occur when the powers-that-be assigned the best work to the best candidates. Grant, whom I found arrogant and repellant later in his career \u0096 not to mention redundant \u0096 is at his suave-and-smooth best here as Walter Burns, newspaper editor,, with the perfect foil in Rosiland Russell. As Hildy Johnson, Burns' ex-wife, Russell plays was in the process of cutting her teeth developing characters like this. Hildy is the archetype that gave Russell her reputation as a fast-talking dame, with machine gun delivery, and a smart-mouthed answer for everything. Hildy is off to marry Bruce, played by Bellamy, but her ex, Walter, still needs her to be his star reporter and cover the execution of a convicted killer. Every early journalistic stereotype is in full force \u0096 from reporters who would stop at nothing to get their story, to the city editor with a visor and sleeve-garters. Gene Lockhart, Ernest Truex and Clarence Kolb are all in fine form, but even the finest supporting performances pale against Grant and Russell. They are both delightful in this stylish slapstick farce that had previously been filmed as *The Front Page* (and later, again as *The Front Page* in 1974, and as *Switching Channels*). It also spawned a slew of imitators, not the least of which was TV's *Moonlighting*. Screenwriter Lederer's scripts have a freshness even today \u0096 1995 saw a remake of his script *Kiss Of Death* and 2001 brings us *Ocean's Eleven*, which Lederer wrote the script for in 1960.",

Luckily, my eye was momentarily caught by a young and sharp-looking Cary Grant, and I immediately identified the film to be 1940's 'His Girl Friday,' which I had been meaning to watch for some months. Just like Frank Capra's holiday favourite 'It's A Wonderful Life,' the film has fallen into the public domain, and so television stations are completely free to air it whenever they want. This also means that any company is allowed to throw a poor-quality print onto DVD at practically no cost to them, so this is something to be wary of. Unfortunately, I missed a few minutes of the beginning of the film, but I was too hooked into the story to worry about that until later.For his remake of the 1931 film 'The Front Page' (which was directed by Lewis Milestone and starred Adolphe Menjou), Howard Hawks took the story \u0096 complete with all its witty, rapid-fire dialogue \u0096 and changed the male character of Hildebrand 'Hildy' Johnson to a female \u0096 Hildegaard 'Hildy' Johnson (Rosalind Russell) \u0096 and also the ex-wife of the newspaper editor, Walter Burns (Cary Grant). When Hildy expresses her intentions of quitting the newspaper business and marrying Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy) in Albany, Walter takes every precaution possible to prevent her from boarding that train. With a convicted cop-killer, Earl Williams (John Qualen), set to be hanged in the morning, the press-room at the prison is abuzz with vulturous reporters scavenging about for a good story. Rather than simply admitting his continuing love for Hildy, Walter uses the great lengths to which he will go to stop her leaving to tell her how he still feels about her. Also, along the way, Hildy discovers \u0096 as the night gradually becomes more and more exciting \u0096 that she is a reporter at heart, and will never be able to rid herself of the desire to uncover that perfect story.The jokes come thick and fast, with the talented cast delivering the clever dialogue faster than you can register it, barely giving you any time to laugh. Especially in screwball comedies such as these, actor confidence is absolutely essential, and everybody involved here performs admirably. In addition to the entertaining and often-heated banter between Walter and Hildy, other excellent characters include Bruce Baldwin (the unfortunate would-be future husband whose is arrested on no less than three occasions, and whose mother is kidnapped), the bumbling Sheriff Peter B. Hartwell (Gene Lockhart), Walter's sneaky henchman, Diamond Louie (Abner Biberman), the governor's clueless delivery-man, Joe Pettibone (Billy Gilbert) and a long line of newspaper reporters, each of whom witnesses the same event and yet still reports it in a completely different and entirely inaccurate manner.",

That however, does not take anything away from this funny comedy.  I liked the movie, and I must confess that sometimes even the natives have problems understanding such fast paced English.  That is a clever idea because the audience feels that many facts are happening,   when in reality no one is going anywhere, and what we are seeing is just a very witty script.  I recommend it, and I believe that most people would enjoy it!  I also love those 1940's dresses that  Rosalind Russell wore in the movie. My favorite scenes\": Walter Burns\" Cary Grant (Father Goose, An Affair to Remember) framing the other guy \"Bruce Baldwin\"  Ralph Bellamy (Trading Places,  and 133 other movies) getting him into trouble all the time. The way \"Hildy Johnson,\" Rosalind Russell,  (Auntie Mame, Gypsy) will be at Walter's by Friday. The situation comedy is just hilarious! Favorite Quotes: Hildy Johnson: \"Walter, you're wonderful, in a loathsome sort of way.\" Bruce Baldwin: \"Nice little town, Albany. They've got a state capital there, you know.\" Bruce Baldwin: \" He's got a lot of charm.\" Hildy Johnson: \"Yes, it comes naturally; his grandfather was a snake.\" This movie is a classic. It is so much fun! I recommend it. After you watch try to talk as fast as they did in this movie, ha!",

            "content": "Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are two of my favourite screen personalities, but this movie's being 100% about the dialogue annoyed me, and the speed of the dialogue just made me anxious!If you don't like words and dialogue - don't see this. It is 100% dialogue. The words are all it is. The leads are just mouthpieces, the stagings very stagey and studio-based - what it has in abundance is words words words, a hundred miles and hour till they grate on your skull, itch at your skin and come out your mouth as you tell it \"enough, stop!\" This is what Stroheim feared movies would become - all talk, no cinema.Interestingly, the reason the talk grated on me was half how rushed and urgent it was, half the fact that i could only half hear it because it was a cheapie DVD with bad sound. The insight it afforded me was to point out to you all that the words are the artifice that this film consists of. There are many movies in this world that you could turn the sound off and not only still understand it, but have a ball of a time watching them: Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Touch of Evil (1958), The Searchers (1955) and 2001 (1968) spring to mind - but there are heaps of them. The best movies combine dialogue with pictures for a terrific experience (Citizen Kane, 1941 is one of the best).Everything cinematic was forgotten in this film, though, and Stroheim's worst fears for the end of silence and the coming of sound were proved true.If I can stand properly hearing the dialogue, i'll probably watch this again some time - but i did not enjoy it at all.2/5.",

You'll want to watch this one again and again to catch all of the terrific dialog. Some of those witty lines (at least as legend has it) were improvised, such as when Grant describes Bruce Baldwin, saying that he \"looks like that film actor, Ralph Bellamy.\" Later, during a rapid-fire telephone exchange, Grant responds to another actor's line with \"The last person to say that to me was Archibald Leach just before he cut his throat!\" (Archibald Leach of course, being Grant's real name.)

In fact, for a slapstick, down and out laugh-o-rama, this movie tries to instill a lot of depth into their characters. The plot is about the distinguished journalists of the era, and pokes fun at what they were really like. Everyone is out for a scoop, and will do anything to get it. Corrupt officials and an escaped soft spoken murderer make this even easier for the reporters. Cary Grant, of course, leads the stellar cast. He could make \"Equus\" look exciting, so give him a great screenplay, and he comes through. Of course all the movie versions were hilarious. It might depend on whether you prefer Grant or Mattheau.

            "content": "***SPOILER INCLUDED***His Girl Friday is the film version of the play The Front Page. Lee Tracy played Hildy Johnson and Osgood Perkins played Walter Burns. In this film, Hildy Johnson was changed to a woman.Don't know why some people think this movie lacks humor. I was chuckling right from the very beginning. Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are Walter Burns and Hildegard \"Hildy\" Johnson. He's a newspaper editor for the Morning Post and she's a star reporter. They're divorced with no children. I thought their dialogue at the start of the film was so goofy and sarcastic. Despite the funniness in their negative exchanges, one really does get the impression they truly loathe each other. I think it's interesting how some of the earliest movies Cary Grant starred in mirrored his personal life. He found it hard to maintain serious relationships with women, and he didn't have kids from any of his marriages throughout the 1930s and 1940s (his first and only child wasn't born until 1966). Anyway, back to the film - after finding out she's going to marry a dull insurance agent named Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy) and live in Albany, NY, Walter persuades her to cover one last story. Earl Williams, a bookkeeper who stays to himself, has been convicted of killing a black policeman, and he (Williams) is going to be executed. Walter tells Hildy that she's William's only hope, because her story can prevent him from being executed. The middle of the film was pretty slow, but over time action and hilarity ensues. I know some reviewers said it was annoying how everybody was talking at once, but I thought it was funny. Towards the end when Walter and Hildy were on the phone at the same time, and he started yelling at whoever he was talking to - I lost it and started laughing to the point of tears. There's a lot of name calling and quirky expressions, but it never feels out of place or too random. The only thing I didn't like was how, at the end, she blew off her engagement to Bruce to remarry Walter. So they were trading insults much earlier, but just because they worked together and saved the day, they thought it was a good idea to be a couple again? If only life was that simplistic. Otherwise, I enjoyed His Girl Friday. Where I live we had gotten remnants of Hurricane Ian. It rained for 5 days straight, so this movie was just what I needed to lift my spirits. I highly recommend if you're a fan of old films!",

            "content": "In the 1928-29 season on Broadway, the Ben Hecht-Charles MacArthur collaboration of THE FRONT PAGE was performed for 276 times. Soon thereafter, Hollywood Beckoned and the movie houses were doing a good business in the filmed version of THE FRONT PAGE (Caddo Company/United Artists, 1931). The film has a quite distinguished pedigree; what with Producer Howard Hughes, Director Lewis Milestone and co-stars Adolph Menjou, Pat O'Brien, Mary Brian, Edward Everett Horton, Mae Clark, George E. Stone and a fine group all turning in excellent and properly cynical, yet humorous performances. This was not to be the only version, though, as Tinsel Town would return to the well frequently.Once again as THE FRONT PAGE (Universal, 1974), the story was filmed; but this time it was the creative team of Director Billy Wilder and \"the Odd Couple\" of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. Additionally, no less than four times (Count 'em folks, 4!); it was adapted for the TV audience. The small screen brought us versions in 1945, 1948, 1949 (As a TV Series, yet!) and in 1970.But the story has much more to it. A reworking of the Premise from being about the Newspaper Racket to the running of a Central American Banana Plantation was the basis for TORRID ZONE (Warner Brothers, 1940); which co-starred James Cagney, Anne Sheridan and Pat O'Brien. This time it was Pat in Walter Burns-type boss role, instead of his being the patsy.A \"modern\" and updated version transforms the whole scene to the Electronic Media, substituting a Cable News Channel for the \"STOP THE PRESSES\" Newsprint world in SWITCHING CHANNELS (Tri-Star Pictures, 1988); which Starred Kathleen Turner, Burt Reynolds and Christopher Reeve. This version was Directed by Ted Kocheff. It was different media; but the same old stuff.Now as to Today's Featured Feature Film Festivities, we present, the Star of the Show, Director Howard Hawks' HIS GIRL Friday (Columbia, 1940); which many consider to be the best FRONT PAGE filmed version or adaptation. The story is essentially the same; but there are a couple of major roadblocks thrown in just to make things interesting. Quite simply, they made 'Hildy' a nickname for Hildagard, instead of Hildebrand; then they made the Walter Burns and Hildy Johnson characters into Man & Wife, or more precisely newly divorced Ex-spouses! The rest of the plot is the same. Managing Editor Walter Burns (Mr. Grant) tries to prevent his best reporter, Hildy Johnson (Miss Russell) into staying on to cover the top story of the day. And that story would be the pending execution of an apparently mentally disturbed Cop Killer, one Earl Williams (John Qualen). The seemingly simple premise becomes a most fast moving, breathtakingly paced farce as seen on the Silver Screen.The outstanding performances in the film, and they are many, should be recognized at this time; so then we shall. Beside the Co Stars of Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell we must consider Ralph Bellamy (Bruce Baldwin), Gene Lockhart (Sherriff Peter Hartwell), Frank Orth (Editor Duffy), Helen Mack (Mollie Molloy) and Abner Biberman (\"Diamond Louie\") all turn in true character performances. Clarence Kolb (the Mayor) and Billy Gilbert (Joe Pettibone, Reprieve Currier) provide the sort of interplay that one would expect from a pair of top-flight Vaudevillians; which, of course, they were! Rounding out this little \"Recognition Ceremony\" of ours is the group who portrayed \"the Gentlemen of the Press\", that is the guys camped out in the Press Room at the Jail who await the execution of Earl Williams. That great little group of fast-talking', wise-crackin' men of literature was made up of Ernest Truex (Bensinger), Porter Hall (Murphy), Cliff Edwards (Endicott), Roscoe Karns (McCue) and Regis Toomey (Sanders).",

Because the genre tends to carry various aspects of life in one story, making a Screwball Comedy masterpiece requires the craftsmanship of writers and directors. A struggle to balance one's professional life and private one, a positively depicted battle of sexes, an energetic journalism scene and its people--the director Howard Hawks masterfully interweaves these ingredients in His Girl Friday. In addition, the contribution of the celebrated actors can never be appreciated enough. For example, Cary Grant gains the viewers' laughter by his distinguished acting, while nowadays actors in numerous mediocre rom-coms can only do it with situations and deadpan humors.One small drawback is that some side characters, including Bruce Baldwin (the new fiance of Rosalind Russell's Hildy Johnson), Earl Williams (a guy who would be executed), and his girlfriend Molly Malloy, are treated dreadfully, as if they were props.",

Remade several times, (and in fact, this was a remake itself) `His Girl Friday' is about Hildy Johnson (Russell), an intrepid reporter who decides to leave the journalist life and marry Bruce (Ralph Bellamy), a boring and bland man who is direct contrast to her conniving and charming ex-husband (and former editor) Walter (Cary Grant).  During the course of the film, Hildy finds herself sucked back into `just one more story' and mayhem ensues.  There is nothing wrong with the acting in the film, it is all quite good; and the script is also fairly funny, if a little dead at times, but I guess my expectations were higher since it was in a fairly high position on the IMDB 250 list.  I'm sure that popularity and exposure is the answer to my question, but I found myself comparing other films from the same time that I thought were much better, (notably, Preston Sturges' `Unfaithfully Yours' which is an absolute scream) and wondered what made this film more highly regarded.  Certainly, star power is another factor, and Cary Grant had it in spades.There isn't a lot that I can specifically criticize the film for, and while it certainly didn't raise my ire up like a lot of films I dislike, it instilled a feeling in me that is almost worse \u0096 ambivalence.  I'm glad I saw it finally, but there was nothing exciting about it to deem a repeat viewing anytime in the future.--Shelly",

I agree with everyone else; this is a stroke of genius. (And I'm very familiar with the original.) While I don't dislike Cary Grant, I'm not in the \"He's so classy and talented\" crew. But he has some damned funny scenes in this.By the time Grant and Russell are alone in the pressroom making phonecalls and shouting a lot, you may have reached your limit. It's pitched a little too frantic and loud, like the entire movie Arsenic and Old Lace did (also a Grant pic). But it's a small flaw.In comparing this movie to a similar movie concerning a little man, Capra's Meet John Doe is such a treacly, less honest, more conniving take on the topic. You may forget at certain points through all the cynicism that HGF supports a form of activist and advocate journalism. And that even if the leads are externally hard-bitten they are trying to save the life of an innocent man; the moral center of the movie.There are still rubes who believe that a president is exactly whom he presents himself to be.

His Girl Friday doesn't have a single one of them. Directing is pretty usual, the story is cockeyed. Only actors did a really good job, especially the leading ones.

Sometimes the plot got lost along the way (\"The Big Sleep\") but he was always a superb story teller.Hildy Johnson, Rosalind Russell, is an ace reporter about to marry a dull insurance salesman, Ralph Bellamy, but her editor wants to keep her on the paper. Cary Grant couldn't have been a better choice for the role of Walter Burns, Hildy Johnson's editor. He's handsome and roguish and lies with every breath he takes.Hawks rewrote the play. In the original, Hildy was a man but Hawks, who never quite got his gender roles straight, heard a talk-through and decided it would be more interesting if Hildy were a woman. And that enabled the writers to introduce the jealousy element, which wouldn't have fit the original story unless we're talking homoeroticism.I felt kind of sorry for Ralph Bellamy's character. Even his name -- Bruce Baldwin -- sounds like the noise a foot might make when it's being pulled from sludge. The poor guy is earnest, sincere, highly principled, and lives with his mother in Albany. He's the kind of man that every woman in the 1930s wanted to build a home with -- a beastly impulse in itself -- only they'd have to get rid of mother first. Ground glass in the Pablum perhaps.That mother is a real pain in the neck too. She's supposed to accompany them on the overnight train to Albany and travel with them on their honeymoon. Burns traps the feisty old lady into some contretemps and tells his goon, Louie, \"Take her down to Polack Mike's and tell the cops she was plastered,\" or something like that.Try putting a line like that into a politically correct movie today. Polack Mike's. Notwithstanding the fact that the Polish word for Polish people is \"polaki.\" The movie rises into the surreal once in a while. The assembled reporters, when they're not playing poker in the press room, speak in headlines. They call their editors with stories that can't possibly be printed. If additional guards will be placed around the scaffold during Earl Williams' hanging, the lead is \"Sheriff just adds new family members to city payroll.\" Roger Ebert, a Chicago newsman himself, took some pleasure in seeing how much things had changed since the 1920s, but the change was to be expected. The eternal verities aren't very eternal when you get right down to it. When I was a kid, every car looked like it had been made in 1939, the mass was said in Latin, and you could supposedly look up girls' dresses by covertly glancing at their patent leather shoes. Now -- it's all changed. And where did it go? (Sob.) Kleenex, please. Thank you.What an enjoyable and funny movie this is. Oh, it creaks at the joints, but that's to be expected because it's so old. It's like Cary Grant talking Ralph Bellamy into writing out Grant's insurance policy with Rosalind Russel as the beneficiary. Bellamy objects a bit because he wants to provide for her all by himself. But what if he can't? \"Can't you just imagine Hildy when you're gone? Sitting on the porch swing? Old lace and lavender?\" Bellamy says dreamily, \"Yes, I can.\" Grant stands back and snaps, \"She's OOOOLD, isn't she!\" I can't stop laughing at the irreverence.",

The couple plans to move up to the state capitol of Albany, where Ms. Russell wants to keep house and have Mr. Bellamy's children. Russell rejects Mr. Grant's offer to re-marry and remain a reporter. Sensing Russell really loves him and wants to continue her assignments, Grant maneuvers to have her cover the recent shooting of a \"colored\" policeman, by troubled bookkeeper John Qualen (as Earl Williams)...This re-make of Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's \"The Front Page\" most notably swaps the gender of the roles played by Russell and Bellamy, which gives everything a lift. Russell plays a strong \"Hildy\" but succumbs to some stereotypes by the end; still, we believe she will manage to asset herself in the future. The pace is breakneck and the script fast, with overlapping dialogue spilling out of the newsroom. Double-takes include the \"pickaninny\" story (carried over from the original) and the way Bellamy's character is described by Grant, \"He looks like that fellow in the movies - Ralph Bellamy.\" Director Howard Hawks knows when to leave a take alone, and walk-ons like Billy Gilbert are great.******** His Girl Friday (1/11/40) Howard Hawks ~ Rosalind Russell, Cary Grant, Ralph Bellamy, John Qualen",

            "content": "There really aren't any good comedies around at the moment.  Within the past five years or so, there have been only two that have really stood out; There's Something About Mary, and The Castle.  If you don't like Jim Carrey, lazy spoofs, or the gross-out 80s teen revival, you're not going to find many laughs in the cinema.There seems to be an increasing reliance on cross-genre films, that describe themselves as comedy-drama to excuse their lack of laughs.  One good joke every half hour is the usual average, and the TV sitcom has overtaken cinema as the most reliable joke-teller.  It's frustrating that there are a few laughs every minute in a 22 minute episode of Seinfeld or Roseanne, but a movie sets its sights so low that you're lucky to find one memorable line in the whole thing.It's refreshing, then, to go back to when comedies were actually funny, and funny for their intelligent dialogue as opposed to second rate sarcasm, and funny for their inventive slapstick as opposed to someone just slipping on a puddle of vomit and falling on his arse.  The speed and intelligence of His Girl Friday puts modern comedies to shame.Every Cary Grant movie has charm just from his being cast, and he is matched here by Rosalind Russell.  They combine to bring one of the funniest partnerships in film, and their extraordinary chemistry lends credibility to the obvious ending.  It's predictability comes not from being such a clich\u00e9d plot device, but from their attraction being obvious and genuine from the outset.  The venomous insults from Russell and the devious flirting from Grant are just perfect.The pace of the film is mentioned in every review, and it has to be mentioned again here.  It's simply breathtaking, and shows supreme confidence in getting more jokes out in one scene than most movies manage in their entire running time.  There are moments when it gets frustrating because laughter from one joke drowns out the next, and without the rewind button half the script would go unheard.  The quality and concentration of the jokes guarantee that this is one to watch over and over.Beyond the manic pace and endless one-liners, there are serious points that give the film a greater depth.  It has much to say about career politicians, who care only for their ambitions, and the role of the press, who care only about their story.  There is a surprising cynicism that translates perfectly to a modern audience, and Grant's idea that `divorce doesn't mean anything nowadays' is wonderfully cutting and more relevant now than back then.  It is equally modern in its presentation of Russell, who is acknowledged as the best of the reporters.  Surprising for a film of such age, her character is never patronised, and never treated as a gimmick.  Indeed, the only things that date it at all are the few references to Hitler and the `European War'.It's hard to write a review that does justice to such a great comedy without quoting half of it, but the jokes deserve to be seen in context and delivered by the cast itself.  But I have to mention the great in-jokes, of Cary Grant describing Russell's fianc\u00e9 as looking `like that actor Ralph Bellamy', and then making a quick reference to Archie Leach.His Girl Friday is one of the funniest, fastest comedies ever made, and when you next come back from the cinema in a bad mood after seeing the latest non-comedy, stop by a video store and rent this to remind yourself that some films can actually make you laugh.",

At one point in the screenplay, he tells a blonde moll to look for the man in the taxicab who looks like that movie actor--you know, Ralph Bellamy. Another quip has him bringing up the name of Archibald Leach, another inside joke for those in the know.Russell is the mistress of fast dialog and has a role that is way over the top, a parody of a fast-talking newspaper woman if ever there was one. She, Grant and Bellamy have a delicious scene early in the film where Grant is treating them to lunch after she breaks the news of her engagement. The interaction between these three stars as they prepare to lunch together is the ultimate in timing and comic interplay between three pros.As screwball comedies go, this is one of the best.

She loves her job, but her sweet yet boring insurance salesman fianc\u00e9 Bruce (Ralph Bellamy) would prefer her to be a housewife, not a career woman. Hildy warms to the idea, and goes to the office to tell her editor Walter Burns (Cary Grant, great as usual)she's through with the newspaper game and ready for the quieter side of life.

Poor Ralph Bellamy. In both this and 'The Awful Truth' he has to play the poor sap to the witty, urbane Grant. Ros Russell matches Grant with every line, and it is amazing how fast she could deliver her lines. Grant was the undisputed king of comedy and fast-pacing, yet Ros almost tops him in this one! They are marvellous together, and ooze sophistication. The funniest moments in this film definitely come from the Grant-Russell teaming, and Grant's series of pranks to get rid of Bellamy. There is rarely a gag that fails to deliver. My only query about the film is, surprisingly, the dialogue. There's nothing wrong with it, it's just delivered so fast that some words are missed completely in the speed of it all.'His Girl Friday' is also a great satire of the newspaper industry and the length reporters will go to to cover a story.

Directed by Howard Hawks as a worthy followup to his hilarious Bringing Up Baby. The production is too stagy and the conclusion is somewhat sour when figuring one factor tampers with the affairs of another. Russell is terrific as a woman wanting to settle down yet motivated by her career. Grant is on target with fast talk and faster thinking. Bellamy is a great foil, bewildered as to the predicaments he is thrust within. Gene Lockhart plays an airhead Sheriff. John Qualen plays a convict up for murder and Friday is doing one last story on this individual. Qualen eventually escapes but turns up during the comedic climax.

His character is so amoral that the guy's just ... he's damn likable. But the real star of this movie (at least, to me) is Rosalind Russell. I know nothing of the play on which this is based, but I wouldn't be surprised if her character was originally a man. She trades jabs with the other newsboys like a fellow man. But this is hardly a complaint; it makes Russell and her character a thrill to watch. She's the fulcrum on which the story pivots and it's heartening to see her go toe-to-toe with any other male character. Poor Ralph Bellamy's naive character has to play straight-man to the others' chicanery, but he's at least the beneficiary of one of the movie's best lines (and a bit of meta humor that directly references himself as an actor).

But if someone says \"I don't like Casablanca,\" I can understand that. Not that I don't like Casablanca. I like it quite a lot. It's just that, well, as much as I like Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart, I just don't think that their skills as actors are very high (well, Bergman's good, while I would pick any number of actresses from foreign films or silent films or more modern films). This is because I do not think true acting, at least for the American talkies, came about until the likes of James Dean and Marlon Brando. Acting before seems only to have been born from the style of acting you see in the theater. I have never been a huge fan of the theater because of this same reason. Actors act only with their voices. They have to get what they are saying heard, so nothing ever sounds sincere. There are so few silent moments.His Girl Friday is a great example of this. There is not a second where people aren't talking a mile a minute. Even when the dialogue is great, it starts to grate on your patience. But this is just a small criticism of mine. Although I would completely sympathize with someone disliking this film, I liked it a lot. Even if the dialogue does grate, it is still great. And the actors, even if they do act as if they're on a stage and not as if they were human beings, are very good. Cary Grant is always great to watch. His abilities are effortless. I could never imagine him in a serious role (I'm sure he had to have had a few; my only other Cary Grant experiences are two of his Hitchcock films: To Catch a Thief and North By Northwest). He's a lot like Bogart, and any number of other stars (as opposed to actors), whose persona is so fun that we go along with him wherever he goes. Rosalind Russel is an actress I've never seen before. If I ever do, I won't be able to see much beyond the persona she establishes as Hildy Johnson. She may have been a very popular actress, for all I know, but even if this were her first film, she holds her own with Grant. The supporting character actors, especially the other newsmen, the gangster, the sheriff, the mayor, etc, are all very good. My only other complaint is that the few dramatic moments in the film tend to work against the overall comedic mood of the picture. The entire execution part of the plot seems almost as if it is from another movie. And especially the suicide attempt of Molly Malloy (what a terrible name, by the way) hurts the film. In fact, the rest of the movie is so good, that it almost cancels out these creaks. Almost. 8/10.",

            "review_title": "Comedy of Remarriage",
            "content": "I have never seen \"The Front Page\", the stage play on which \"His Girl Friday\" was based, or either of the two filmed versions of it from 1931 and 1974. I understand, however, that in those versions of the story the character of Hildy Johnson was male, and that when Howard Hawks made this version he originally intended to follow the original play in this respect. He eventually, however, changed his mind and made Hildy female. (At this period a \"girl Friday\" was a junior female office assistant; the application of the term to Hildy, an experienced journalist, is presumably ironic).Like many of the screwball comedies of this period, this one is a \"comedy of remarriage\". (In the same year, 1940, Cary Grant made two other films of this type, \"My Favourite Wife\" and \"The Philadelphia Story\"). The normal plot line is that the male and female leads are a divorced or separated couple who end up rediscovering their love for one another, and the attraction of this sort of story for filmmakers was that it allowed them to deal with the theme of divorce, then considered very daring and sophisticated, while providing a happy ending which would please even the most hardened moralist by showing the triumph of conjugal love. (Although the heyday of comedies of remarriage was in the thirties and forties, they have never gone away; \"Bird on a Wire\" and \"Sweet Home Alabama\" are two more recent examples).Grant here stars as Walter Burns, a newspaper editor. Hildy (in this version it's short for Hildegard) is not only his former star reporter but also his former wife. Their marriage and their business relationship have now come to an end and Hildy intends to settle down to a quiet life of domesticity with her new fianc\u00e9 Bruce Baldwin, a rather dull (and none too intelligent) insurance salesman. Walter, however, asks Hildy to cover one last story for him, the execution of convicted murderer Earl Williams, and she accepts, less as a favour to her ex-husband than because she wants to help save the life of a man she believes to be innocent. Which leads to many further complications, including the inevitable discovery that Walter and Hildy are still in love with one another.Although \"His Girl Friday\" is primarily a romantic comedy, it does contain some satirical barbs aimed at the American newspaper industry; Hildy's idealism and concern for accuracy set her apart from most of her colleagues in the press room, who are only concerned with landing a spectacular scoop which may or may not bear any relation to the truth. On a more serious level the film also has some things to say about the death penalty and about political interference in the judicial process; the city's corrupt mayor and sheriff are anxious, for political reasons, to see Williams executed so do all they can to bring this about, even trying to bribe the messenger bringing a reprieve from the governor to go away.The film is noted for its quick- fire dialogue, particularly in the \"battle of the sexes\" exchanges between Walter and Hildy. It manages to pack a large amount of verbal material into a relatively short running time. One notable innovation is the use of overlapping dialogue with one character speaking before another finishes. (This technique has also been used by a number of more recent directors, such as Robert Aldrich). This development not only has the effect of making conversations sound more realistic, it also adds a greater sense of pace and rapid movement.The film also plays games with a well-worn movie convention, the convention that nobody ever notices the resemblance between a fictional character and the actor playing that character. Normally all films starring (for example) Cary Grant take place in a parallel universe in which the actor Cary Grant does not exist. Here, however, Walter describes Baldwin by saying \"He looks like that fellow in the movies, you know...Ralph Bellamy!\" Bellamy was, of course, the actor playing Baldwin. (This line was, apparently, an ad lib on Grant's part, but the director Howard Hawks liked it and allowed it to remain). Another film which plays a similar game is the more recent \"Ocean's Twelve\" in which Julia Roberts plays a character who is pretending to be Julia Roberts \"because everyone says I look like her\".Cary Grant had a natural gift for screwball comedy which made him the obvious choice to play Walter; Hawks had two years earlier directed him in another famous screwball, \"Bringing Up Baby\". Rosalind Russell, however, was not the first choice to play Hildy; that was Carole Lombard, but the studio could not afford her. Nor was she the second choice; that was Katharine Hepburn, Grant's co-star in \"Bringing up Baby\" and \"The Philadelphia Story\", but she turned the part down, as did several other actresses. Russell, however, makes the part so completely her own that it is difficult to imagine anyone else in the role, and combines well with Grant in a two-person comedy team. (I was not previously particularly familiar with Russell's work, except as the stage mother from hell in \"Gypsy\", so I was interested to see another side to her).I would not rank \"His Girl Friday\" quite as highly as \"The Philadelphia Story\", one of the best comedies of the period, but it is certainly better than \"My Favourite Wife\", a dated, sentimental film which today comes across as more cornball than screwball. It is a fast-moving, witty comedy which still stands up well today. 8/10",

It's funny throughout and it even features a fairly well-rounded plot, which unfolds essentially in tandem with the character sparring that serves as the main event. There's more to it than you might expect and Rosalind Russell makes an excellent leading lady who's more than capable of keeping up with Cary Grant. It's a really enjoyable affair. 7/10",

The actors have done a magnificent job of being able to remember and recite long trains of complex rapid fire dialogue combined with precise stage directions necessary for the early years of complex sound recording. The unfortunate part is that while sometimes it's a good thing for jokes to come fast and furious, other times it's good just to sit back and let a joke sink in slowly. the director in his zeal to pack as much in to 90 minutes as possible does not grasp comic timing so well. an otherwise great movie suffers for it.",

There's plenty of plot too though as Hawks mixes his mastery of the screwball comedy with an escaped prisoner, newspaper machinations, political corruption and of course, a twisted, barbed love story into one heady, breathless mix.The film is famous for its overlapping dialogue and even when it's not it's delivered lightning fast demanding perfect timing from its lead actors in the main. Enter Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell as editor and top reporter, ex-husband and wife and on-going sparring partners, both happily on top form as they go at each other hammer and tongs before the inevitable conclusion is reached at the end of the film.Only when the humour takes in the character of the portly court messenger delivering the governor's pardon does the humour become weak and forced, otherwise it's pacey, racy and at times risqu\u00e9 especially when Grant is in full-flow as only he can. I loved the insertion of the in-joke on Ralph Bellamy and wonder if it was an improvisation which the director liked and kept in. I also picked up on references to a number of topical subjects such as the European War the US hadn't yet entered and the gangster-crime of the day, highlighted when Grant in a phone call to his paper rejects potential lead stories one-by- one, to make way for Hildy's scoop covering the condemned prisoner's break-out.Set-bound as it is, perhaps unwittingly betraying its theatrical originals, Hawks' fast-moving direction ensures the viewer's attention is held from start to finish and in Grant and Russell, he had the perfect actors to make his film fly.This is classic Golden Age Hollywood film-making of the top-rank and although other versions of this story have been made down the years, this has to be the definitive version, I'd wager.",

The film is at its best early on, but when it begins focusing on the convicted killer, the plot line that gives Russell the lure to return to reporting, it bogs down and loses my interest.Fans of zany, frenetic, screwball movies will like this film, but at some point everyone just seems to be shouting at one another, and there just isn't enough balance in it for me.It's somewhat incidental, but I wasn't a fan of the premise that the white killer was convicted and unfairly sentenced because he had killed a black policeman, as if this and not the reverse was (and is) the problem in America, and the heaviness of the satire on the free press.",

Walter's sharp-tongued and highly independent ex-wife, Hildy Johnson, has since quit the news business, but has dropped by to let him know she is remarrying the following day. The clock is ticking on the innocent man's life, as well as Walter's presumed second chance with Hildy, so what are a couple of fine talents like Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell to do but spew out their inspired and quotable dialogue out twice as fast.

Walter still loves her and does not want to lose his best reporter, so he sets out to undermine her decision and keep her on staff.The real star of this film is the writing. Throughout most of His Girl Friday the dialogue moves along at breakneck page. Take a look at the first scene in Walter's office, where the ex-spouses are bantering back and forth. You have to wonder how long it took to get that one film. Great work by the two actors to remember those lines and spit them out so quickly while retaining the intent of the lines.This is a multi-layered comedy. Where most comedies employ only one or two elements of comedy, HGF layers many elements and achieves success with each. Note the use of physical comedy (as when Walter lifts his shorter minion high enough to look through the glass into his office). The script is filled with inside jokes, which are more fun if left to the viewer to discover. The dialogue moves so quickly that you might miss some of the wordplay, but even on first viewing you can pick up more than enough to dazzle. A running gag is the dueling phone conversations, displays of great timing and, probably, much rehearsal. Speaking of timing, certain scenes are classic farce.Through all the fun and games, HGF also manages to comment on some serious issues. The politicians and the journalists sometimes battle, but they both are shown to be unscrupulous and unconcerned with truth. Another reviewer called HGF a \"tribute to journalists\", but I say it excoriates the trade--depicted in this film as exponents of yellow journalism.A reviewer also said that it is difficult to imagine anyone else playing the leads in this film. I often feel that way about a film, but not in this case. When you read about all the actors who turned down the roles or who were passed over, I can imagine most of them playing these parts. Clark Gable as Walter? Absolutely. Ginger Rogers or Irene Dunn or Jean Arthur as Hildy? Sure. The writing is so good that it rises above the actors who inhabit these roles. That is not to say that I didn't appreciate Rosalind Russel's ability to play a believable reporter who hangs out with and competes with the boys. I like the way she uses her ambling walk when Hildy is in her reporter mode. And Cary Grant really captures the shrewdness of Walter--a man who can change strategies or personalities on a dime. He is the real salesman, not Bruce. In the scene were he treats Hildy and Bruce to lunch, try to imagine Grouch Marx in the role of Walter. The writing is so good, it can mold itself to the comedy stylings of many actors.",

            "review_title": "Another Cary Grant Re-marriage Classic",
            "content": "It's always interesting to watch classic films that have a very different tone and feel to anything that comes out in today's world. His Girl Friday is very much a screwball comedy, and that genre in itself is a product of its time. It still holds up 70 some odd years later, but films just aren't made this way anymore. It's a fast talking and dialogue driven film about a man who is willing to do whatever it takes to keep his ex-wife and former reporter from marrying an insurance man.Cary Grant plays Walter Burns, the editor of the Morning Post., while Rosalind Russell plays his ex-wife and reporter Hildegard 'Hildy' Johnson. It's based on a play, but Howard Hawks, the director, made one bold but brilliant move by switching the sex of the Hildy character. I'm not sure how the play was written, but the dynamic between Hildy and Walter creates not only immensely funny moments, but also a relationship you root for in a film. Normally, it's not easy to root for a character who wishes to break up a soon- to-be marriage, but Grant brought a great sense vulnerability that proved to make it easier to feel for his character. It doesn't hurt that Cary Grant is one of the most charismatic actors of all time. What I found most impressive wasn't the acting or the notably funny script, it was the direction of Howard Hawks. I had seen a few of his films in the past including The Big Sleep and one of my favorite films of all time, Bringing up Baby, but it was his direction here that caught my attention the most. It's very difficult to keep an audience's attention without any real action or a ton of physical comedy like his other films, but Hawks uses these dialogue driven scenes in a way that doesn't feel overwhelming, instead, it proved to be very entertaining. I understand that the invention multi- track recording wasn't developed yet, so he told the sound mixing crew to turn the overhead microphones on and off throughout the film to create the final product. It's that dedication and attention to detail that makes Hawks one of the most celebrated filmmakers of all time.As I said before, this film is a product of its time in the way it's made. If you look at the editing for films that come out today, it's smoother and the cuts aren't usually very noticeable. In His Girl Friday, you can tell that the technology wasn't available for them to make each cut appear as seamless as they should be. It doesn't necessarily dampen the film's greatness, it's just a way of telling when it was made. In comparison to other comedies close to its release, such as The Philadelphia Story, another one of Grant's remarriage films, I think His Girl Friday has a much lighter tone. The sub- genre of screwball comedies known as the 'comedy of remarriage' has turned out some great entries like Holiday and Bringing up Baby. The ladder being far more like a Chaplin comedy than this film was in its humor. But His Girl Friday proves to be lighter, wittier, and probably aesthetically more important for its significance historically.The narrative focuses a lot on getting a 'scoop' as most of its main characters are writers of some sort. While newspapers are nowhere near as popular as they were during that time, I think the days of getting 'scoops' have returned. Whether it's breaking the latest in a political race, what the Kardashians have been up to, or dropping the latest scoop on the next superhero movie, the media is still obsessed with being first at something, except now it's on social media. So in a way, that's an argument against that His Girl Friday is a product of its time and more so proof that this film is important and should be taught today.The film is brilliant with its comedic timing. Whether it's the delayed reactions between each of the fast talking characters, or the insane and hectic phone conversations the writers are having throughout the picture, His Girl Friday has plenty of entertainment. You can definitely tell that it's based off of a play through the line delivery and its far-fetched plot, but everything works. It did a lot for films at the time as well. Hawks' big change from the play was the decision to make Hildy a woman. Not many films did something like that, if at all. Even today, you see far too little female roles on screen and His Girl Friday was one of the few films to change the story and add a female because it makes the plot far better. It's that type of progressive work that makes His Girl Friday a very important film then and now.+Grant is perfect+Witty+Phone conversations8.5/10",

Journalists could be bad or good, it's just a matter of which side they want to show with full conviction but what if we get to see both the sides together? Here comes Howard Hawks's His Girl Friday based on Journalism but exploring multiple genres like Drama, Romance, Comedy and little of satire. The film seems to be dated now cause many films have been made on hardcore journalism which left strong impact on society so a popcorn flick on such a universal concept might not be known as a Great Film. However, it can be called a Great Fun ride. We don't need to give stamp of Conceptual misunderstanding if Rom-com is one of the most popular genre for the audience. His Girl Friday doesn't make much sense in characterisations and thier behaviours are illogical too. But the babbling and tricks are 2 big things which makes it a terrific Comedy Flick which can be enjoyed multiple times. Sadly it fails to give justice to some big characters involved in the storyline because they had to give more space to the leading pair. Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell's continuous chaos, arguments, quarrels and chatterbox gags are fantastically drawn. They might not make much sense if you are looking for quality but otherwise it is so much fun and laughs to see them tearing apart each other. The heavy rush of continuous disasters and Twists could have been handled sensitively and calmly but the screenplay failed to provide the moments. Maybe a sensible director like Howard Hawks could have looked into it and sorted it out if wanted but don't know why it did not happen. It could be because he wanted to keep it busy and chaotic, but if not then i am sorry. Even in positive manners, the sense was missing anyway so there is no point to discuss further on it. The bottom line is, His Girl Friday is ENTERTAINING and if it's the only thing that matters then BIG YES for it.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "content": "This just in--- I like this movie. Directed by Howard Hawks, the movie is most famous for its clever fast-track dialogue, inside jokes, dark humor, and crafty one-liners/comebacks. This was really unheard of, from most 1940s film industry that was still kinda unsure in people wanted to see talkies or silent films. Indeed, it's one of the first, if not the first, films to have characters talk over the lines of other characters, for a more realistic sound. Prior to this, movie characters completed their lines before the next lines were started. It's in a rapid fire machine gun talking. I find it astonishing that human beings can talk this fast! The movie had lot of spontaneity and ad-libbing, and you really do see it. Honestly, if you take away much of the dialogue, you only got like 10 minutes of footage. There were some scenes that went a little too long in the pacing department, but it seem like it went fast, most of the time. The movie is adaptation by Charles Lederer, Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur of the play The Front Page by Hecht and MacArthur. The major change in this version, introduced by Hawks, is that the role of Hildy Johnson now played by female actress, Rosalind Russell. When director Howard Hawks was planning to make the film, he was going to cast a man for the part. While auditioning actors, a female secretary would read the lines belonging to that man part. Hawks loved the words coming from a woman so much, they decided to rewrite the part for a woman. Honestly, it's great to see a women actor in a more commanding equal role. It's also nice to see women, outside of the roles that normally you find in films from the 1940s that portray them as housewife, young unwed-daughters, or rich socialite. Honestly, I think this is one of the first movies that portray a newswoman. It shows that women are just as good in, gathering up the news, in what was once deem as a male's club only profession. Rosalind Russell is just as good as her co-star, Cary Grant, as Walter Burn, her ex-husband and ex-business partner. She indeed pretty much, carry the second half of the film, despite being Hawk's last choice to play Hildy. Yes, she did had help writing clever dialogue, by her brother. Still, she gave one-hell of a performance. One of Rosalind Russell's many gifts as an accomplished actress was her ability to act by not only words but by using great body language and amazing facial expressions. You see it, here. Cary Grant is just charming and funny as Walter Burns. It's odd to hear that 1940s critics thought he was badly miscast as Walter and Clark Gable would made a better choice. In my opinion, I do believe that, if you put Cary Grant in this movie against Clark Gable in 1934's It Happen One Night, you can see Cary Grant channeling his inner Clark Gable impression. No matter, what. Cary Grant was great in the role. There was still a bit of things that he did that was a bit unlikeable, but for the most part, he seem right man to play the wise cracking, always get what he wants, Walter Burns. In all cases, the adaptation stay close to the basic outline: Hildy Johnson, reporter, wants to quit the business and get married. Walter Burns, editor, doesn't want to lose her star. In the background, there are a convicted man, a hangman's scaffold, a courthouse newsroom full of cynical reporters, and an incompetent and corrupt sheriff and mayor that needs to be reported on. There were a few other different, as Walter does everything he can to keep Hildy from leaving, including setting up Hildy's soon to be husband, Bruce Baldwin, (Ralph Bellamy) with trumped up charges to get arrested over and over again. I felt this was bit too crude. After all, Bruce wasn't a bad guy. Walter even got his henchman to kidnaps Hildy's stern mother-in-law-to-be (Alma Kruger), all for mashing. How wasn't that not illegal? The man is really going all dark in his attempts and manipulation to win her heart. It's a bit disturbing. It's also a bit upsetting how both character mistreat the characters of the murder trials to the point, that one of them jump out a window. The character plead with the newspapermen to tell the truth and help him is heart-wrenching, and they lied to her face. That's really crude for a comedy. They ain't human. I know; they're newspaper men. Another fault is that the movie has no conclusion. It was all for nothing. They still dealing with the same old problem that both reporters character dealt with in the beginning. Nothing is learn. Other minor complains is the lack of music. Since the producers fail to renew the film's copyright. The movie falls into public domain, meaning that virtually anyone could duplicate and sell a VHS/DVD copy of the film. Therefore, many of the versions of this film available on the market are severely or badly edited or of poor quality, having been duped from second- or third-generation copies of the film. You can probably find a copy on the internet. Good copies are out there. Even with the movie way over 70 years now. There are still things worth watching that you probably didn't notice before, like the short scene of \"Stairway Sam\". Even the Hayes office seem to not to notice that. If you can't find this movie, watch 1931 Lewis Milestone's film, and 1974's Billy Wilder's film, The Front Page. Both are good watch, as well. Overall: His Girl Friday is a great satire of political corruption, the callousness of the pressmen, and how cold the news media is. No wonder why this film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. It's that good.",

Walter's quest to prevent Hildy from leaving the paper reaches ridiculous extremes, as death row inmate Earl Williams (John Qualen) breaks out of prison. As the police hunt Williams, Walter draws Hildy back into the business - leaving poor Bruce taking the fall for everything. It all builds, of course, to a ridiculous, over-the-top, feverish climax, as Walter and Hildy are hiding Williams from the police, the Mayor (Clarence Kolb), and, perhaps more importantly, from their fellow journalists.\"His Girl Friday\" is the epitome of the screwball comedy - the genre of rapid-fire dialog and misunderstandings which snowball to gigantic proportions. And what a film it is. A fabulous cast and amazing script propel this flick to stratospheric heights. Its amazingly fast-paced jokes, lovable cynicism, fabulous cast, and overall outrageousness make for a hilarious combination. I can't think of a single comedy I've enjoyed more than this film.The film contains an extremely cynical outlook on the world. The depiction of journalism is either flattering or damning, depending on your point of view. On the one hand, we see journalists depicted as scheming, conniving, amoral jerks, who will literally do anything to get a story - including manipulating and trampling everyone else. Walter of course devotes everything he has to winning Hildy back - including legally dubious methods - and get the big scoop, which for once may be complimentary motives. The murderer, Earl Williams, and his alleged \"sweetheart\" Molly are used as pawns by everyone - the journalists eager for a story, and the politicians hoping to get re-election. This isn't even to mention poor hopeless Bruce, who finds himself the butt of everything that's going on. On the other hand... can we really fault them? After all, Cary Grant and Rosalind Russel are so witty, snappy, and sexy that it's impossible to side against them. And hey, the politicians are doing it too - and who can side with the ineffectual Sheriff or the scheming Mayor, with an even more callous disregard for human life? It's a dog-eat-dog world, and when everybody is a jack-off (or a helpless loser), side with the cool guys.Hawks' direction is marvelous; the film isn't visually astounding, although the use of shadows in the jail and courtyard scenes are effective, but his handling of the actors and story are extraordinary. Hawks and writer Charles Lederer also make a great improvement over the source material (the play \"The Front Page\" by Charles MacArthur and Ben Hecht) by making Hildy a woman. This seems like a minor difference at first, but it unquestionably enhances the chemistry and relationship between the two actors, making Walter's manipulation of Hildy more urgent and endearing. All other considerations aside, you have to give His Girl Friday at least one point: This is undoubtedly THE fastest-talking movie of all time. Charles Lederer's script is filled with endless zingers, comebacks, and wit - along with amusing ad-libs (mostly by Cary Grant - you know the ones). And the actors are absolute naturals at it. This kind of humor makes modern comedies like \"The 40 Year Old Virgin\", \"Meet the Parents\", and even \"The West Wing\" (its closest modern counter-part) look lame in comparison.Cary Grant is an old hand at this genre (Arsenic and Old Lace, Bringing Up Baby) and his Walter Burns is a wonderful character, obnoxious yet charming throughout. His motives would be sweet if it weren't for the situation - and the methods. Rosalind Russel matches him quip for quip as the extremely sexy \"modern woman\" Hildy. The whole supporting cast is fabulous. Ralph Bellamy makes the sad-sack Bruce an endearingly honest fall guy. John Qualen as the criminal and Helen Mack as his \"girlfriend\" contribute amusing characters, who find themselves trapped in the ridiculous webs of journalism and politics. The whole supporting cast - Gene Lockhart as the inept Sheriff, Abner Biberman as Walter's pickpocket buddy, Martha Kern as Bruce's beleaguered mother, and Porter Hall, Ernest Truex, and Cliff Edwards (among others) as journalists - are fabulous. If even one actor were off their game, this film wouldn't work - but everyone down to the extras is fabulous.In conclusion... what more can there be to say? His Girl Friday is perhaps THE greatest comedy of all time. See it, laugh your ass off, lather, rinse, repeat. You won't regret it.10/10",

            "content": "Morally objectionable journalism practices instigate absurd high jinks in Howard Hawks' \"His Girl Friday,\" based on the play \"The Front Page\" by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur. The only thing more over the top than the rapid dialogue would be Hawks' portrayal of the newspaper business during an era where the press became part of the story rather than covering it objectively from the outside. Either way, it makes for good fun from an audience perspective.Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell star as Walter Burns and Hildy Johnson, ex husband and wife, the former the editor of a major New York City paper and the latter his ace reporter, one who intends to quit her job (and the profession for good) and remarry with a nice insurance salesman (Ralph Bellamy) in Albany. As a man on the losing of a divorce settlement who hardly has any scruples to begin with, Walter doesn't take kindly to the news and pulls the necessary strings to turn keep Hildy within his grasp. Apparently, that even means exaggerating the story of a man expected to be hanged for shooting a police officer to make it so juicy that Hildy can't stand to lose the scoop.The two have an excellent chemistry, but a kind much different than most films of that era. For one, the speaking lines are rattled off faster than usual and the banter much more hectic as a result. In ways this ups the humor because you barely have time to catch your breath in between the jokes, but at times it requires more focus than usual for a comedy. Hawks' likely desired to capture the hectic nature of 'the biz,' but it really just makes the film more ridiculous. Grant surprisingly thrives as Walter, a rather despicable role and Russell really stands out amongst the boys. It's hard to believe her character was male in the original play; she adds so much dimension and character to the film.Goofy would aptly describe \"His Girl Friday\" in a number of instances. It makes very light of some serious subject matters to suggest a satire of journalism in some regards, but it's mostly just insanely witty slapstick in fast motion. The character dynamic between Grant and Russell carries the first act until the goofiness takes over into a farcical second act. Although at breakneck speed, it's amusing to watch the reporters call up their news desks the second events change and start giving exaggerated accounts of everything.\"His Girl Friday\" is not the iconic romantic comedy of the Golden Age, but then again, it was never intended to be a romantic film in any regard. Unusual for that time as well, it would probably require a second viewing to be most enjoyed as not having to figure out what's coming next would free up some time to truly listen and ingest Grant and Russell's terrific lines.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",

            "content": "A remake of the 1931 film \"The Front Page\", in turn, based on the play of the same name. In the previous versions, the starring role played by Rosalind Russell was a man. Here, not only is she the top reporter for a newspaper Cary works for, she is his recently divorced wife, Hildi. Cary's character several times admits that he was a poor husband, hence doesn't blame her for seeking a divorce. He never specifies in what ways he was a poor husband. However, Hildi says she is looking for a husband who will allow her to be a kept woman with a normal middle class life, with kids, and an adequate social life and occasional vacations. Hildi has already found a prospective husband-to-be in a character played by Ralph Bellamy, who is superficially approved by Cary. But, secretly, Cary wants her back, both as his girl Friday and as a wife. He is sure she will soon get bored without the excitement of being a competitive reporter. He is proved correct when Hildi, against her claim, jumps at the chance to be the first reporter with the scoop on an escaped cop murderer due for an imminent hanging. This is reckoned to be a big newspaper story, bigger even than the war in Europe! Meanwhile, Cary arranges to have her husband-to-be look like a crook. Several times, he lands in jail. Eventually, when given a choice, Hildi decides to type up her story rather than follow her husband-to-be to his home in Albany, where they would live with his mother for a while. As a result, he gives up on her, and she sobs that her apparent escape has collapsed. The implication of the last scene is that she has decided that she is better off giving Cary another chance to prove that he can be an adequate husband for her. She asks for a honeymoon at Niagara Falls, which Cary agrees to. But just then he gets a call that a strike in Albany has been called. He says they can stop at Albany long enough to get the story, before going to the falls. By her action, Heldi apparently agrees to this plan. In the beginning of the film, Hildi complained that on their way to their first honeymoon, they got sidetracked into covering a coal mine accident, and never made it to their honeymoon destination. Is this going to happen again, or is Cary going to manage to squeeze both in? Apparently, Hildi has faith in the latter scenario.A newspaper newsroom was an excellent setting for a comedy of this type, dependent on short deadlines, confusion, and ultrafast dialogue for most of its comedy. Rosalind, as well as Cary, was excellent at executing the snappy dialogue, and juggling frequent simultaneous conversations on and off the multiple telephones on and around Cary's desk. Although most reviewers found this film amusing, I can understand why a minority would not. Roseland was hardly the first choice of the studio to play Hildi. After numerous offer rejections, she was chosen as a last resort, borrowed from MGM. She felt an initial coldness at first, before complaining about such. I suspect the others wouldn't have been quite as good at this type of comedy, with the possible exception of Katherine Hepburn.Cary costarred in 2 other romantic comedies in 1940 :\"The Philadelphia Story\", and \"My favorite Wife\", neither of which were as good as the present film. The 1938 \"Bringing Up Baby\" was more in the class of this film for comedy. The also very popular 1937 romantic comedy \"The Awful Truth\" provides far inferior comedy, on the whole, to my mind.",

            "content": "\"His Girl Friday\" is one of the most famous, fastest, and funniest of the \"comedies of remarriage\" popular in the 1930s and '40s. In it, newspaperman Walter Burns (Cary Grant) tries any means necessary to get back his ex-wife and ace reporter Hildy (Rosalind Russell) before she marries a mild-mannered insurance salesman (Ralph Bellamy) the next day.I had seen the first scene of \"His Girl Friday\" in a film class as an example of screwball comedy dialogue: Hildy comes into Walter's office to announce her upcoming marriage, but it turns into nearly ten minutes of reminiscing, bickering, and talking circles around each other. And they speak as fast as they can spit the words out! Grant and Russell obviously have a lot of fun playing off of one another, and their scenes made me almost dizzy with delight--marveling at the writing, the acting, and the sheer speed of it all! But, while I knew to expect a love-triangle plot and fast-paced dialogue from \"His Girl Friday,\" I wasn't expecting it to be such a cynical and tough-minded look into the newspaper business. More than just a romantic comedy, it has an exciting subplot centered on serious issues like the death penalty and political corruption. An escaped prisoner points a gun at Hildy; Walter conspires with lowlifes to get Hildy's fianc\u00e9 arrested. Both Hildy and Walter are pretty unscrupulous in pursuit of a good story, but this serves to humanize them--they're real people with big desires, not just machines spouting rat-a-tat dialogue. So above all, I loved how \"His Girl Friday\" maintains a balance between the down-and-dirty newspaper world and the ethereal giddiness of great comedy.",

Hawks gamble pays off in spades with as fine of an example of screwball comedy in film history to be found this side of Preston Sturgis.Cop killer Earl Williams is about to be executed but the governor is having second thoughts. Both the mayor and sheriff want him executed to improve their re-election bids. Hildy drops by the press room at the jail to bid fond farewell but Walter wants to keep her on the job as well as have second thoughts about leaving her so he concocts a plan to get her fianc\u00e9 arrested repeatedly while he keeps Hildy on the job.In one of the truly great pairings in comedy film history Russell and Grant are sharp as tacks spitting benign venom at each other as Walter connives and pushes buttons to drive Hildy on to do her job and away from the arms of the haplessly perfect and put upon Ralph Bellamy as the fianc\u00e9.As a cynical Greek chorus (Roscoe Karns, Regis Toomey among others) the newsroom boys chip in another fine performance en masse as they wax acerbic Hecht and Mc Arthur's biting dialogue. Clarence Kolb as the mayor attempting to stay on point bribing an official with double talk is another highlight as well in a film that never stops to catch its breath as Hawks masterfully keeps the energy level high from start to finish smoothly intermingling both of Burns ulterior motives to make Hildy stay put while making wry commentary about political corruption and the death penalty. Few in film have re-tooled a proved winner and come up with a better version. Going from Front Page to Friday merely turned it into a film classic.",

He's eaten alive, almost literally. The ex (Cary Grant at the height of his stardom) isn't quite ready to move on from that lost love, and though the fiancee (Rosalind Russell, in a show-stealing turn) is wise to his tricks, she (and Bruce) find themselves mired by them nonetheless. In the midst of a scheduled execution, a midnight prison break, late edition deadlines and bombshell headlines, the brusque, self-assured lady at the heart of this two-room maelstrom must choose between her lust for a juicy lead and the promise of a fresh start.

It's rightly revered by some, and ignored by others, and both attitudes have their basis of truth, as I can understand there's something to be enjoyed, in terms of movie-making, and something to be ignored. Hawks could be very unpretentious about the dramatic quality of the scripts, and this modified Ben Hecht play is an instance.The movie is masterly, zestfully crafted, the scenes are genuinely funny; the plot is but a heartless, astringent satire by Ben Hecht. It's boulevard theater. The fact that, in terms of acting, I sided with the petty bourgeois played by Bellamy testifies to the script's efficiency. Hildy reminded me of Doug's wife from 'King of Queens'.The main characters haven't been written as a couple (the story of the cast is known), and are essentially cardboard; if the romantic screwball seems trite and uninspiring, it's because it never has been in the stage play, but was an improvement suggested by the actress. The play is a satire, with bourgeois wit, urban wit, and it's heartless and dry, unromantic, without any romance. The witty mercilessness isn't feigned; the empathy is. I have found the satire bombastic and pungent, and insincere, in the sense that the satirist belongs fully to the world he thrashes, and his awareness is cheap (and if it's meant to be socially conclusive, it comes across as hypocritically self-critical). Hecht's play belongs with other works of socialist novelists and satirists from the 1st half of the past century.I can see why some would shortlist Hawks' movie as one of the best (?) movies, while others wouldn't. For me, it was too unromantic, too heartless, too cheaply sarcastic (people are scum, let's laugh; but I did laugh at many scenes \u0085). The play is very dry. Dry not as in discretion, but as in crassness. Reporters are hyenas. Who cares whether the girl cares about the excitement of her job, or the streetwise ability of her manipulative boss, or both? This, like other comedies of that age, was the superior form of the mystery comedies.The satire as such is not only demoralizing, but useless and cheap. A satirist such as this has the right to care. He hasn't the right to be indignant.",

But it did lend a certain seriousness to the movie that neither Bringing up Baby or It Happened One Night had. There was also some excitement with the gun fight and the police cars speeding about Rosalind Russell. I started to get a little annoyed and tired of the bickering between her and Cary Grant after while, but in the beginning it was quite fun. There was also seriousness when the convict's girlfriend jumped out the window. I can see that Howard Hawks directed both this and Bringing up Baby as they have the same witty, fast conversation and movement, however I thought Bringing up Baby the more superior and funnier movie.

            "content": "There were a lot of so-called women's pictures around this time, typically romantic dramas, and pretty much the only movies of that era with female protagonists. His Girl Friday is an oddity in that it began life as a Ben Hecht/Charles MacArthur play with a male lead. Somewhere in pre-production the decision was made to turn the hero of what was originally called The Front Page from Hildebrand to Hildegard. But this did not simply make it another women's picture.You see, although the title now reflects the gender-swap and the lines have even been re-jiggled to make Walter Burns the hero's ex-husband as well as ex-boss, this is still very much the same story as before. It's as if the female Hildy was there in potentia all along, with the familiar, quarrelsome relationship between journalist and editor having been very much like antagonistic ex-lovers all along. It's significant because this makes her a strong, professional character, as opposed to the floppy, flimsy females that screenwriters usually came out with in this era.The new Hildy is magnificently brought to life by Rosalind Russell. Russell is fluent in sarcasm, and the knowing, world-weary tone she brings to her lines is exquisite. She seems totally at ease amid the boys' club atmosphere of the newsroom, and more than able to carry the movie and match up to her exuberant co-star Cary Grant. Grant shows a touch of Ned Sparksism in his performance, and it is easy to see Burns as the sort of pompous grouch that Sparks would normally play. By and large though this is prime Cary, with plenty of ridiculous exclamations and indignant gestures, best of which is a dismissive flick of the hand as he tells everyone to \"get out\". There are plenty of fine supporting players too. Ralph Bellamy is perfect as Hildy's would-be husband Bruce, Bellamy being an intelligent man who is good at acting a buffoon.The action is overseen by ace director Howard Hawks. Hawks is brilliant at handling smooth switches between the general and the specific. The movie begins with a lengthy tracking shot (or rather two shots, but the blend is disguised) going right-to-left, showing off the indistinct business and bustle of the newsroom, before coming to rest on a slightly more empty end. Then Rosalind Russell enters, and we follow her with another tracking shot left-to-right. It's a great way of introducing the character. This second tracking shot is ostensibly a reversal of the one before it, but the first one is a broad picture of a place and the second has its focus on one person. Throughout, Hawks encourages not only the oft-praised overlapping dialogue, but also punchy visual collages of tense and hasty movements. Whenever the gaggle of reporters are in the room there's always one chewing gum or shifting his balance. His Girl Friday begins at high speed and from then on barely pauses for breath.Of course, not all the genuine women's pictures of the 30s and 40s were poorly-written, and in fact a lot of them I enjoy immensely. But seeing His Girl Friday, a woman's movie that became one almost by accident, is a breath of fresh air when one compares it to the stereotyped imagery that was actually pitched and presented to women. It also happens to be a fun, witty and nicely-made movie.",

And that's not the half of it. Older films are notorious for the actors sometimes talking too fast, but this film raises the bar (or lowers it). And believe it or not, they did it on purpose! It turns out director Howard Hawks suffered from the tragically misguided notion that 'talking impossibly fast translates into superior comedy,' and so he purposely sped up the dialogue in this film to an incredible 240 words per minute! (Average speech is about half that.) He even held side-by-side comparisons of this film with the one on which it was based (1931's \"The Front Page\") so that he could prove his film was faster. And it is so fast, in fact, that the viewer can't possibly keep up with it. I had to turn on the closed-captioning AND hit rewind no less than 20 times, just to catch things that had been said by one character or another....because they are talking so ridiculously fast AND they are often talking over each other. How is this funny? Dude, it's not. It's really irritating and frankly, got very annoying after a while. The rapid-fire repartee makes this film an absolute chore to sit through. Another reviewer here recently stated the too-quick and overlapping dialogue gave him or her a headache, and I could absolutely see why. Talking really fast is NOT comedic genius.And that's sad, because without that this would have been pretty decent. There is a fair amount of fun dialogue/exchanges between Grant and Russell - when you are able to understand them - making this a good but also rather typical comedy of the period. (Those claiming the dialogue here is superior haven't seen enough films of the '30s, like the Marx Bros. or \"The Thin Man,\" or they'd know better.) The story is interesting, and the screenplay works, so that I would have probably given this an '8' had the actors spoken like normal people. As it is, 90 minutes of aggravation knock it down a few pegs, making it a '5.'Best Line: Grant (to Russell): 'Let's see this paragon! Is he as good as you say?' Russell: 'Why, he's better!' Grant: 'Well then, what does he want with you?' Russell: 'Ah, now you got me!'Times watched: 1. Would I watch again (Y/N)?: No way. I can't do irritating more than once.",

            "content": "\"His Girl Friday\" is actually a remake of the 1931 film \"The Front Page\", which was based on a hit stage play of the same name. However, for this version the filmmakers changed the character of star reporter Hildy Johnson to a female (Rosalind Russell) and made her the ex-wife of editor Walter Burns (Cary Grant).The story opens with Johnson announcing to Burns that she intends to remarry and is leaving town with her fianc\u00e9e in a matter of hours. Burns doubts that she's really serious about settling down so he lures her into covering one last story under the pretence of aiding a wrongfully condemned man.The screenplay is fast-paced and chock full of incisive wit. However, I have to take issue with the change made to the character of Hildy Johnson. To me, the romantic element seemed to be somewhat tacked on and lost in the shuffle. Then again, the unfolding of the big newspaper story didn't really do much for me either.The cast is a good one, though. Rosalind Russell is the best of the lot and she should've been nominated for an Oscar. Cary Grant's up to his usual standard and Ralph Bellamy contributed a good performance as well. Meanwhile, the remainder of the cast is well chosen and uniformly capable.In the end, the movie delivers everything I'd expect from a Howard Hawks film but the end product seems to be less than the sum of its parts. The breathless pace merely serves to mask an uninteresting plot. It has some strong points but, as a screwball comedy, it's certainly no match for \"Bringing Up Baby\".",

The dialogue is delivered at a breathtaking pace by actors with a real chemistry (Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell) that delivers all the facets of the genre superbly.The film is focused on newspaper media and in particular The Post edited by Walter Burns (Grant) who we see at the start of the film discovering his divorced wife, ex-ace reporter at The Post, Hildy Johnson is about to up sticks, leaving her career, indeed the city and marrying an insurance salesman (Bruce Baldwin played by Ralph Bellamy) the next day and they are leaving town that today on a sleeper train to Albany, New York!Burns uses all the tricks he can muster to delay or even prevent Hildy leaving with hilarious results with an execution sub-plot leaving Hildy struggling more and more as the film progresses to leave and start a new life with her rather boring fiance or hang around for one final scoop.Director Harold Hawks overlaps dialogue ensuring a rapid turnaround of words per minute that can be quite mind blowing especially if it went over its 92 minute run time.The film is notable for the ad-libs by Grant which in itself add to the comedy of the film and bring new meaning to Archie Leach (A Fish Called Wanda (1988)) and co-star Ralph Bellamy when Burns in one scene describes Bellamy's character as like that man in the movies, Ralph Bellamy.Hawks cleverly uses camerawork movement when showing characters answering one telephone and answering another ringing telephone.The newspaper hacks shown in the film notably in the courthouse press room are all shown as corrupt media types.

Have you ever heard anyone put so many words into a sentence without drawing a breath as when she finally for the umpteenth time tells Walter Burns (Grant) that she's out of the news business while tearing up her last interview?  And then, maybe predictably, as the latest news breaks right in front of her, she automatically turns into a relentless news hound! This is a smart movie, it has plenty of plot and character development, it has great strong characters, it makes commentary on the newsbusiness then that is relevant to the newsbusiness today and sarcastically shares the modern view of government I think, as well.

Adapted from a play by the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, director Howard Hawks changed the second lead to a female, centered the story more on the hustle and bustle of journalism and a success was born.Of course it helps that the two stars were Cary Grant, arguably the greatest of all comedic actors in early Hollywood, and Rosalind Russell, an actress borrowed from another studio but may very well be the only one who could have pulled this part off. The dialog also works as something of true genius. Charles Lederer adapted the play, but it is really Hawks that deserves the credit as he was open to allowing virtually any type of spontaneous idea or improvisation to further improve the story. Here, I am sure there were countless instances and it works seemingly every time.Here is a film that is a great success and it isn't all just one person. Hawks directs furiously and paces so well, fitting in just what we need to understand exactly what is going on, Grant and Russell have wonderful chemistry and can handle the rapid-fire dialog, and all the supporting characters pitch in as well and do a marvelous job, particularly Ralph Bellamy as the boring fianc\u00e9 who even allows an in-joke at his expense.

            "content": "Comedy just isn't done quite like this anymore. Back in the days of classic actors like Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell comedy was a much more respectable genre. In a time of such war and peril comedy was looked to as the most important film genre as it let people escape the horrors of real life, if only just for a couple of hours. Of course here I am in 2011 watching the film, so that aspect doesn't really affect me, but that's beside the point. His Girl Friday is a fun and charming story about the newspaper industry. Cary Grant plays Walter Burns who is trying to prevent his ex-wife Hildy Johnson, played by Rosaslind Russell, from remarrying. He gets his opportunity when a huge story about a falsely accused man on death row lands. He prolongs her departure from journalism allowing for all sorts of screwball antics. It's a movie you can't regret watching whether you like it or not.I should point out that I'm not the biggest fan of older comedies like this. I'm not a huge fan of comedies anyways. But I can't deny that this is a very well made film that has a lot going for it. First off, the way the dialouge works is masterful and it's something that is all but absent from modern day comedies. All the dialouge is delivered very fast and articulate. It has a very natural nonstop cadence to it. These actors deliver their lines with the utmost flawlessness, never stopping for a breath and never missing a beat. Cary Grant is obviously one of the all time greatest actors and in His Girl Friday he proves what he's worth and displays himself as a master fast talker. The other actors do just as well in their articulate delivery and it gives this film's cast an ensemble stature, and all of their talent brilliantly culminates into one magnificent final product.Today we very rarely see comedies with a point. Your average idiot comedy is good for nothing more than a chuckle so that afterwards you completely forget you ever saw the film. Back in the old days where comedy flourished, comedies had a point. His Girl Friday is not only an entertaining comedy but it serves as an interesting look into the politics and ethics of journalism. There is all sorts of lying, backstabbing, and double crossing going on in this film. It's all tongue-in-cheek of course but it is very prevalent. In some ways this film could be considered a satire of the newspaper industry. Amazingly enough, the things this film parodies are still relevant today. Scary right? And for what it's worth the story in His Girl Friday is much smarter than you would expect. It has a plethora of characters and plenty of twists and turns to keep the whole story interesting.To those who like this kind of genre in this time period this is an absolute classic. To people like me who aren't quite as interested in it, it is enjoyable but not something I would watch again. I don't regret watching the film and was mildly amused for an hour and a half, but that's the extent of it. I would highly recommend this film to anybody who likes classic cinema, screwball comedies, or Cary Grant. To those who don't, why would you consider watching this anyways?",

He has also got on screen two of the finest comic performances from two of the finest light-comedy actors ever. Rosalind Russell is a rare blend of determination, cool-headed excitement and compassion, and is a formative female protagonist in an otherwise totally male film. Her performance appeals to our sense of fairness as well as our sense of humour, and we both share her desire to escape the newspaper world and see that such a dynamic soul will never be truely happy in the secure but dull arms of Ralph Bellamy's character. Cary Grant is the perfect antagonist, and the perfect opposite to Bellamy. Despite the fact that so many of the qualities Grant displays are morally dubious, we delight totally in his unscrupulous machinations, and have very little sympathy for the morally correct character that Bellamy plays. This is a fascinating observation on the way screen sympathies defy normal day-to-day behaviour. Cary Grant gave many fine performances during a particularly dignified career, but this is in my opinion one of his best, and is certainly my own favourite. There is something of the Falstaff mentality in him -both can lie and exagerate without compuction, and we love them for it even though we are horrified too. And yet there is always a little glimpse of something more in his character than the flippant rogue. The machine-gun retorts, the scheming and the suave \"performance\" all mask something -though we never learn enough about him to know what. Thus the part is ideally suited to Grant, whose charming screen persona was in many ways a cover for a more introverted psyche. The film cannot lose with these two and the script, and the way Hawks allows his actors to \"cover\" a scene. Look at some of those scenes and you will see how many of them are done in one shot. The dialogue and the chemisty between Grant and Russell is really allowed to sparkle because of this, and the scenes are very slick in their dynamics. Fortunately the supporting cast are marvellous too, and the scenes in the newsroom at the jail have an intrinsic comic quality of their own which marry very nicely with the \"main\" body of the comedy in the action between Grant and Russell. There is an invasion of this world when Grant arrives there towards the end of the movie. The pace quickens there as soon as he appears, and it is as if the story goes into a different key -more intense and electric, and it stays like this until the end.   HIS GIRL FRIDAY is a movie that demands multiple viewing, and which will continue to delight each time. If you get tired of the plot or the script, just enjoy the performances and note the countless nuances, or take a moment to admire the stylish ease of Grant's suits against Bellamy's awkward costume, or indeed the photography, the lighting, the editing...or if (God forbid) you finds it really boring after a hundred viewings, try counting how many words are said in the first scene between Russell and Grant!",

It's not everyone's type of comedy, but it's exactly the type of comedy that I like: witty, cynical, and slightly absurd.Some people complained in other reviews that it's too loud and annoying, that everyone talks on top of one another, and that the characters aren't like-able. But that's pretty much everything I like about it. Not many movies are willing to take the risks that this one does, but it totally pays off. And, despite their gaping flaws, I end up liking the characters anyway.This movie makes a lot of statements about politics, the media, gender roles, and more that are still relevant today, 80 years later. Of course, that's probably another reason people don't like it. But as far as films that make statements about such heavy topics go, this one is one of the best, tongue and cheek just enough to make you forget how real some of it is.I still question how I feel about the title, considering it refers to Hildy as Walter's loyal and competent \"right hand man\" but the reference also puts her in a subservient role, which the movie doesn't reflect. It's something to mull over, like so many other bits and pieces of this clever film.",

Classic screwball style comedy. Excellent photography, lighting was good and also the story was a lot of fun. Carey Grant really made the picture, his arrogant and confident personality made him the hero of the entire movie. Ralph Bellamy playing a gullible unaware nice guy was absolutely hilarious. I think the romance in this movie was so well done, because the couple tried everything they could to let it all go.

Howard Hawks' 'His Girl Friday' (1940) is a film that all comedies should aspire to, not plagiarize, in one way or another. For in it do we get a hyper-real, deliriously delicious blend of ludicrous situation, pitch-perfect acting and, most importantly, ingenious dialogue. What's also important is that we don't think for one second that there's the slightest measure of implausibility in this film. That's because these characters are essentially human \u0096 we get a peek at both their glorious and vulnerable moments.Hildy Johnson is the girl Friday ace journalist for the newspaper run by the conceited, incorrigible corrupter of news items Walter Burns. She wants out. Bruce Baldwin, the clueless insurance salesman, is the chute out of the fast life that she'll ride. Early in the film Hildy approaches Walter in order to tell him that she's quitting the newspaper business in order to fulfill her natural role as a female by getting married to a buttoned-down, decent, and unambitious man and pushing out some pups with him. Well, this troubles Walter and he barely lets us, the audience, know this \u0096 all we see is a back going rigid and hear a voice silenced. Cary Grant as Walter Burns is uncannily good as a bloodless newspaper hound. He applaudingly defeats his romantic, man-of-every-woman's-dreams persona with this nasty, in-the-media-dirt being (we relievingly don't see him in a tux for a change!). The rest of the film depicts the underhanded travails and sadistic maneuverings of this conniving, yet affable beast of a human being.Granted, we are needlessly subjected to cheap, dollar-book Freudianism but we don't care \u0096 our adrenaline more than compensates for it.'His Girl Friday' repays repeated viewings for several reasons, but I'll only mention one: the film is overstuffed with jokes and lyrical, well-timed dialogue. I'd rather not give any for-instances because that'd be unfair \u0096 only the actors are deserving of delivering.",

Improvisation is obvious, especially in areas in which characters fall into each other's word.

Of course, Grant's ex-husband and was again excellent. Tired of it or not, he is in the role of ex-husbands excellent.

And Walter Burns is exactly this kind of a reporter.\"His girl Friday\" was directed by the great Howard Hawks and stars wonderful Cary Grant and impeccable Rosalind Russell. Cary plays Walter Burns, this hard-boiled reporter who will not stop at anything for a good story and Rosalind plays his ex-wife who tries to start a new life with a new man, played gorgeously by Ralph Bellamy - he's just superb in this kind of supporting roles - even his character in the movie looks like Ralph Bellamy. In the end, no matter how bad something or someone is for you it's what and who you love that counts.\"His girl Friday\" is so much fun to watch because it shows how the conversation happens in real life - when people interrupt each other and speak while somebody else is speaking so the cacophony of voices occur. To tell you the truth it was confusing at first to observe this verbal crossfire when I first watched this movie but with each time it gets more and more amusing. The cinematography in the movie is remarkable and masterfully done long shots are being used each time the characters have a talk-out what creates a presence effect and you can't keep but enjoying every second of it.Newspaper world, shown in the picture, touches upon its true nature - senselessness. Reporters don't care about the feelings of the people they write about or the true events - they care about making a headline, the front page and selling more copies of the newspaper and getting money. In a way nothing has changed since because we ourselves do not need the truth, we just need to be on the same page with the rest of the world.

Howard Hawks who directed this was a great director who has made some fine movies, even great movies and this is a great movie.Interesting is the setup and it's a relationship between an editor and journalist, and how they converse. Now this journalist Hildy is engaged to her fianc\u00e9 Bruce Baldwin (ralph Bellamy) and editor Walter wants her back. To be right, Hildy is the ex-wife of Walter. Noteworthy is the audio graph of the film, I have seen through this film that right in 1940 people were having such an overlapping tone and the conversations were so free flowing. The sound was so realistic that at times I was amazed considering that in 1940 there was such technology put into use. Hats off for this, to the makers and to Hawks specifically who got every note of the dialog pitch perfect. I am say that most of the dialog was mellifluous.Also admirable is the pace of the film, in 90 odd minutes, so much was happening in an editor's office. And each time I heard them speak, I was mostly smiling. It brings smiles to us, and that's what this very film did. Most of the time, I was happy and I love it coz it made me happy. The art direction, the cinematography just seem to be complementing the vision of the director, the expression and dialog of actor so well that I was struck to it in admiration. I so very wish that we make more such movies in Hollywood than some crap action and comedy pieces. If today's comedy is either sleazy or slapstick, this genre was called screwball comedy because a few balls of the audience were screwed by the laughter it brought out. It did not make me laugh out loud though but made so very happy. Thanks to Hawks for taking this up and making a fine film from a wonderful premise. The acting by each one is apt, in-fact the enunciation, the body language, the expression all are in sync with what is needed for the scene. And that's the hallmark of great director, who can extract some great performances. Hawks certainly did extract some memorable performances. I am going with 4/5 for this wonderful fine gem.",

            "content": "This comedy is one of those considered one of the best within the screwball department, and for good reason. The movie is all about Walter and Hildy, a divorced couple whose relationship really never worked out for them and now Hildy is going to get married again to man named Bruce Baldwin. Hildy used to work on the newspaper that Burns is editor of but has since realised the journalist's world is not for her and she wants to settle down in Albany with her new husband. Of course the plot never quite goes smoothly, Walter wants Hildy back on the job being his star reporter but she simply doesn't want to go back and not even a murder case where the accused may be innocent will tempt her back in when Walter first asks. The movie is a great mix of fast humour and wit, sarcasm but also just generally great characters and although some are pretty unlikeable, they are well acted throughout the movie.The two big stars of this are Cary Grant (Walter) and Rosalind Russell (Hildy) and they bring with them an expert class of acting that really makes this comedy come alive. The film even suffers slightly when we don't have say Grant in the picture for a little while, for me he is the stand out and some of the lines he is given are delivered with incredible style. The whole cast are pretty good to be fair too, Ralph Bellamy as Bruce is good and plays ever so well when the film see's Walter basically mocking the man without his knowing. The character of Earl Williams is very strangely funny, just his voice works to get most of the jokes out well and another character too Mr Pettibone adds to the speedy plot that never stops for breath.Howard Hawks brings the film in nice style to the screen and really brings the most out the actors at his disposal. It is Hawks who gets the film really going fast and also he that sets up this busy style film where everyone seems to rush in and out of a room in a split second. The adaption of the play \"The Front Page\" comes out funny on the big screen I mean this movie is never laugh out loud funny not really but it is the true intelligence of all involved that makes it really good. I think if anything stops it from being perfect then it is the fact that the middle and end can feel a little flimsy but all in all never breaks up, the actual end scene is very very fast and ends the movie is a way you probably won't be expecting.So His Girl Friday is just a real classic and one I couldn't recommend more to people, I know some will think they will not like it but I watched this twice in two days not because I loved it so much but because after the first viewing I knew I had missed many gags and knew it was better than I thought it was. Some could say this movie is also one of the very best in the careers of Grant and Russell, both give stunning performances so much so that after viewing this film and researching it I expected them to have taken some awards home for this but no. So anyway a screwball comedy that really makes you laugh but it is also really interesting as well, the kind of movie that if watched right, you won't take your eyes off it for a second.",

            "content": "I wanted to go back to the classics and, since I have an interest in journalism of the time, along with being a fan of fast paced, dialogue heavy comedies, His Girl Friday seemed like the obvious choice for me and after watching the film, I made the right choice.The film follows journalist Hildy Johnson who has left the newspaper she works for, The Morning Post, and is going to marry insurance salesman Bruce Baldwin. When she goes to inform her ex-husband, newspaper editor Walter Burns, of the news, mainly so he would stop calling her all the time, Burns does everything in his power to sabotage the marriage as he still has feelings for Hildy. At the same time, an execution is planned for convicted murderer Earl Williams, which the mayor and sheriff want to be carried out so they can keep their jobs, and Burns wants reprieved so he has a better story, getting Hildy involved, which reignites her passion and skill at journalism, although things take a turn for the worse when Williams escapes from jail just before the planned execution, and takes refuge at the newspaper office. The thing that makes the film work so well is the dialogue. The fast paced nature of it allows for some great comedic moments to come out, mainly in the scenes involving Hildy, Walter and Bruce. This is aided by the performances which I'll talk about later, which allow for the dialogue to be bounced off at such great speed, which helps make it so funny. The overlapping nature of the dialogue, covering multiple conversations, is brilliant to see, and it's clear to see how this film influenced other comedies in the future, such as the films of Robert Altman. There are also some great satirical elements at play, mainly in relation to the politics, mainly the crooked nature of the mayor and how him and the sheriff are willing to let someone die in order to get better approval ratings.The performances matched with the dialogue are what really make the film though. This is actually the first film with Cary Grant in that I've seen and this was a great introduction to him. His fast delivery of the dialogue is excellent and he does a good job showing his love for both journalism and for Hildy, along with the amoral components of the character, it feels completely believable that he would have someone arrested on false charges because of his jealousy and using the diritest tricks possible to get a story, showing his lack of morals. This performance is matched by Rosalind Russell as Hildy. There's a clear commitment to the character throughout the film, aided by Russell hiring someone to help write her lines to ensure she had good material and it works for the character. The love-hate relationship between Burns and Hildy works because of how well Grant and Russell bounce off each other, especially when the dialogue gets faster and faster. Russell also does a good job at showing that, whilst she does have affection for Bruce, Hildy is too good at reporting and cannot resist the allure of it to settle down with Bruce. Speaking of which, Ralph Bellamy does a good job as Bruce, showing that he is a nice person but too boring for the likes of Hildy and Burns, his timid demeanour being a great counterpoint to the amoral nature of Burns, which helps show why Hildy finds herself more drawn to Burns than too Bruce. Good performances are also seen from Abner Biberman, who's delightfully slimy as Burns' hired goon Louis, Gene Lockhart and Clarence Kolb who do a good jobs showing the corrupt and incompetent nature of Sheriff Hartwell and Mayor Fred, John Qualen, who gives a quietly sympathetic performance as Earl Williams, and Billy Gilbert, who's a good comedic foil as Joe Pettibone. The only weak link is Alma Kruger as Bruce's mum, mainly because of the stereotypical nature of the mother in law jokes made at her expense.Overall, His Girl Friday is a really entertaining film, mainly due to the strong performances from Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, with excellent dialogue that helps accentuate the performances, whilst also having a bit of a satirical air, particularly to the relation between journalists and politicians. It's easy to see how this film has helped influence other comedies in the years since it came out and I'm glad I saw it",

With the man hiding in the desk to the crazy amount of phone calls that left the press room, I thought it was funny at times. Cary Grant's character Walter Burns was such a jerk. He made it nearly impossible for Johnson to escape the paper man business and he did succeed. It was a sad ending to her and Bruce's relationship.

            "content": "Screwball comedy is a genre, which was born in 1930's and it is one of the most interesting genres of the American film history. For those who are unfamiliar with the genre, screwballs were about fast-word persons, marriages, divorces and getting married again. To quote Andre Bazin: \"Screwball is like a sex comedy without sex.\" That sentence has actually become the most famous description of the particular genre. Frank Capra and Howard Hawks have often seen as the pioneers of screwball. It's an endless fight, which one gets the title as the first screwball Capra's It Happened One Night (1934) and Hawks' Twentieth Century (1934). But many historians and critics tend to choose It Happened One Night as the pioneer. Frank Capra most certainly didn't stop at that he continued making several screwballs such as Mr Deeds Goes to Town (1936) and Arsenic and Old Lace (1944). But so did Howard Hawks with Bringing Up Baby (1938) and His Girl Friday (1940). It was a real fortune that this unique genre got so many brilliant stars in its films such as Gary Cooper, Cary Grant and Clark Gable.Wiring the front page was a very familiar subject for screwballs and films built around that have been made so many times that I've lost count: Mr Deeds Goes to Town, It Happened One Night etc. But His Girl Friday is truly one of the greatest. It tells the story of a newspaper editor (Grant), whose ex-wife (Russell) is getting re-married. Screwballs were always filled with sharp and fast dialog, immorality and ruthlessness. In His Girl Friday Grant's character tries the every possible trick to keep his ex-wife by his side in the middle of the case of the century.The criticism for media is an interesting thing for one to look in the history of cinema. Screwballs loved to criticize media and make fun out of it. But more \"serious\" film did it too for instance Scandal (1950) by Akira Kurosawa, which also deals with the postwar Japan. In His Girl Friday Hawks shows the people that they shouldn't always believe what the papers tell them. They lie, exaggerate, make things up, do the most ruthless things one could imagine and are just trying to make a living. He doesn't show reporters as inhumane monsters, but just shows the flip side of the exciting stories.His Girl Friday is a very entertaining film, it is an important part of the screwball genre, but it is also historically interesting. It was made in 1940 when WWII was going on in Europe, but the economy, politics and film industry was running wild in the States. The film could easily work as an allegory for the disregard of America, but when knowing the thoughts of Howard Hawks the possibility of that is weak, but it is an interesting perspective to approach the film. In any case it is clear that His Girl Friday is a screwball about the ruthlessness in politics and the good old marriage.",

Information brokerage is the key, a frightening way that newspaper tidbits can change reality at the drop of a hat. The love triangle between Grant, Russell, and Bellamy was brilliantly played. Grant plays a ruthless reporter who will do anything to report the news. Although this was way before the advent of the Internet and cell phones, there were phones all over the reporters' office. It was almost like a horror film - Don't answer the phone. It can change your life. Russell plays another ruthless reporter who decides that maybe she needs to quit and settle down with her new fiance, Bellamy (Trading Places). Bellamy's character is critical. He is the nice, stable guy who is not a reporter. Grant's character was once married to her, and it is his object to win her back by appealing to her addiction to reporting. Outside the reporter's office is a hangman's noose for someone accused of killing a police officer. The suspects guilt or innocence is irrelevant in the \"info wars\" of the Media. The cowardly mayor (Gene Lockhart - father of June) wants to execute him until the phone rings. It is hard to keep pace with the screwball comic pace, but it was not just another comedy. It was about how new information to reporters is everything. The Mayor repretends to be this conservative, proud, and moral man, but he is up for re-election. With every new phone call to the reporters a new twist in the story about the police officer who was shot. One moment the mayor is supremely confident of re-election, the phone rings, and all of a sudden he is backing off and changes his story to save himself from losing the election, or even prosecution. This movie was a great satire about the Media, and it is even more scary than comic.",

            "content": "This film is one of those screwball comedies where you have to watch it again and again to get the feeling of it, to catch all of the dialogue (the line delivery has been clocked at 240 words a minute- the average for this time period was 90 words), to get a feeling for the story, to be able to tolerate the stars.I'm not overly fond of Cary Grant, but I like most of his movies from the late 1930s/early 1940s (anything from Bringing Up Baby to Notorious). He is very good here as Walter Burns, who does very thing and anything in his power to keep his star reporter (and ex-wife) Hildy Johnson from leaving the paper. He may seem mean-spirited on paper, but if you watch the movie a couple of times, you will grow to like him and see why he is doing it.Rosalind Russell is in top form as said Hildy Johnson. She would never quite match the one-two punch she had with The Women (1939) and this film (HGF) back-to-back, but while her character of Sylvia Fowler is a gossipy clown, Hildy Johnson is more level-headed and calm, although with the way the characters are written in this film, you're not sure if she's the straight man, or if Walter Burns is.Ralph Bellamy is also good as the man Hildy is planning to marry (she was also planning to leave the newspaper business behind, but watch the film and you'll see how that turned out). The rest of the cast is good, delivering their lines at rapid-fire pace, leaving you wondering how these people even breathe. The guy who played Earl Williams (the murderer) could have been better, but in most scenes you don't notice him.There must be a sub-genre of screwball comedy where the snappy dialogue and fast pacing hide the fact that the plot is quite dark. I mean, they're trying to defend a man about to be hanged for murder with a news article. There's also a suicide of a fairly important character in the middle, Ralph Bellamy gets arrested a bunch of times, it's implied that Walter and Hildy had a fairly toxic first marriage (or at the very least, they didn't get along that well, even if they did love each other and still do)...it's not light stuff.His Girl Friday may not be to everyone's taste- it's fast-paced, the romantic ending may come as a bit of a surprise/shock, AND it was filmed in 1940...so it's in BLACK-AND-WHITE. But it gets better with each viewing, and you understand it more. My initial rating for this one was a very weak 6/10, but I watched it again, and now I give it a very strong 8/10.A little surprised that there weren't a lot of HGF wannabe films that came out after this one. But maybe they were too scared that they might ruin the original (funny thing is, this is a remake).",

After a while, everything goes so fast you hardly remember a bit of it; in fact, you hardly remember hearing most of the details in the story that everyone keeps talking about.  But it's still funny!  In fact, it keeps you at the edge of your seat in some spots!  How a movie can do that, I will never figure out.    Sure, it's a classic.

It was interesting to me how Hildy was seemingly in a position of power of many of the men in the film. We see Hildy, being swooned over by all the men at the paper, and she really just couldn't care less. When she's in Walter's office, she does not take on the submissive, subservient role we often expect women of vintage cinema to be in. She's his equal, and maybe even his superior. She gives him attitude, brushes him off, and most importantly, it's revealed that she is the one who asked for the divorce. Which I feel like is part of why Walter loves Hildy so much, it's because of her fire. We kind of get a sense of thus because of his abhorrence to the idea of her being a housewife. It's kind of funny though, even though Walter likes her spark and independence, he still tries to control her. The whole movie is spent with Walter trying to control Hildy's life and future and by extension taking away the very thing he loves about her. This all could be a huge reach, it's something ,my girlfriend and I both picked up on and I thought it was interesting.",

            "content": "While he was undoubtedly a master in the field of cinema, Howard Hawks had a gift in regards to comedy, particularly romantic comedy, which he showcased in 1938's Bringing Up Baby. As if making one great romantic comedy wasn't enough, he would return to the genre two years later with this 1940 effort. And if you were to say that he excelled, that would be putting it lightly, because this film is truly something incredible.His Girl Friday is a hilarious and lightning-paced comedy that is truly one of the funniest films of all time. Filled with witty and memorable dialogue and an extremely compelling story, this film represents Howard Hawks at his most brilliant. The film also features numerous dramatic elements, such as murder and execution, but Hawks manages to handle it in a way that combines these elements, all while being able to maintain the humor. If there is a film that could be identified as a perfect comedy, then it would certainly be this one.The film is a combination of comedy and a genuine and unflinching feel that usually represents the type of newspaper people who will do anything for a story. More specifically, the film is the story of Hildy Johnson, the ace reporter for a newspaper known as The Morning Post, with the main editor being her ex-husband, Walter Burns. The story begins when Hildy comes to visit Walter to tell him that she's going to be leaving soon, as she's planning to settle down with a new husband to start on a new life. However, Burns is determined to win her back, so he convinces her to join him in following one more story together. However, they get caught up in a frantic case involving murder and city corruption. What ultimately follows is one of the most breathless and hilarious comedies that one will ever have the pleasure of seeing, with a seamless mixture of laughs and satire.The humor is as brilliant as it gets, with the laughs coming a mile a minute, which is very much in a literal sense. When he made this film, Howard Hawks said that he was aiming to break the record for the fastest film dialogue, and if that was the intention, he certainly made a superb effort. Most of the film is focuses on the dialogue, particularly the exchanges between Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell. With their dialogue overlapping with one another. Just listening to those two is an absolute pleasure, as they have a dynamic that's among the best of any of the leads in Howard Hawks' comedies, with Hildy being among the best of the \"Hawksian women.\" There's also a few meta jokes involved, with Cary Grant saying something about somebody named \"Archie Leach\", which was in fact, Cary Grant's birthname. He also mentions something about Hildy's boyfriend looking like Ralph Bellamy, which is hilarious because he is Ralph Bellamy. The film can get rather relentless in regards to the comedic pacing, but it's not done in a way that's exhaustive, which is the result of how clever the writing is. In fact, by the time the film's over, one might even be asking for more.As previously mentioned, the acting in the film helps to make it all the more excellent. Cary Grant is at his comedic best as the newspaper editor who is undoubtedly conniving, but at the same time, very charismatic. It would've been very easy for Burns to come off as incredibly unlikeable, but with his charm, Grant makes him likeable and easy to admire. Rosalind Russell is absolutely wonderful, with some lively lines showing that she's more than capable of holding her own against the male parties, which, as started before, makes her one of the best of Hawks' female characters. Ralph Bellamy is perfect in his role as the straight man, and also has many unfortunate things happening at his expense. Like all of his Hawks' great films, every character in the film contributes a sort of significance to the story. One of the most notable is a smaller role from Billy Gilbert, who plays a messenger from the governor who gets accosted in all of turmoil that unfolds. For the minimal amount of time that he's onscreen, he manages to steal the audience's attention with his comedic talents.To reiterate, His Girl Friday is simply put, one of the best comedies of all time, and is about as perfect as a film can possibly get. From the minute the film gets going, it doesn't let up, with the laughs coming in rapidly, one right after another, and as a result, the film never has a dull moment during the course of its length, as the laughs are literally a mile a minute. Ultimately, the film is a blueprint in regards to how to perfect a cinematic comedy, one that will still have people laughing even decades after its original release.",

This wasn't the first film to marry romance and newspapers, nor the last, with the likes of Capra and Cukor concocting their own tabloid funny pictures. But the play \"Front Page\" by Hecht and MacArthur came out years before, and Hawks's film superbly captures the atmospheric mania and chaos of paper journalism. The chatter of reporters relaying the big scoop into their telephones is handled brilliantly through complex, overlapping dialogue that was painstakingly captured by the sound mixing team. The romantic quips between ex husband and wife Walter Burns and Hilde Johnson (Grant and Russell) are entertaining enough, as is the subplot with her hapless fianc\u00e9, but it's the hysterics of seeing the characters holding conversations between, say, two candlestick phones and a coworker that provides the real physical and situational gags. You feel the urgency as an inmate is on death row for shooting a cop, only for him to escape, as the myriad of journalists all scramble for a story. The complex plot becomes even more intricately fast paced the further the characters become entangled in the escapades, as political intrigue, a love triangle, and a thrilling manhunt all conflict to create unbridled bedlam. At times it's easy to lose yourself in keeping track of the details but that becomes part of the film's charm; making sense of all the pandemonium is half the fun! But beneath the humour is a sardonic poke at the callous influence of the media, something that affects everyone from innocent bystanders to those who hold office. The story makes a darker subtlety about the manipulation of truth although the satire is softened by the romance inserted by the scriptwriters. Luckily this only means that the film has something to offer for everyone.It's a real pioneering work, and its impact on cinema can be felt all the way to contemporaries like Aaron Sorkin and Quentin Tarantino (of who the film is a personal favorite). Just be prepared to feel as the characters do; trying to catch onto the story amidst all the madness.",

Although its a hilarious screwball comedy I also felt like the film made some interesting commentary on journalism and maybe on the passions of life. The film really brings the feeling of a news room with constant rapid dialogue, always cutting each other off in a way that feels realistic, but also pushes the film forward and makes it feel much faster than it is. Although the romance is a main point of the film it does so without pushing it and having only one real sappy moment quickly pushed aside by Walter in a way that is brilliant, but also shows how nothing has really changed and Hildy has simply returned to her roots. Overall I thought the entire film was hilarious and perfectly paced to keep the film moving throughout its duration. This film may have turned me on to screwball comedies as a whole.",

            "content": "This is perhaps Cary Grant's funniest film (I'd rank it a hair behind \"Arsenic and Old Lace\")  The rat-a-tat dialogue has rarely been so perfectly timed as between he and Rosalind Russell, who delivers the definitive caricature of a 1930's career gal.  And Ralph Bellamy's hamhanded nice guy was so effective that his name became synonymous with that type of role. Amazing that he was ever taken seriously afterwards. The writing is superb, better than most any dialogue you'll hear today.  And Howard Hawks directs the whole shebang at just the right pace and tone to keep it all together.The story is pretty simple.  Russell is Grant's ex, and she's come back to see him at the newspaper he edits and she used to write for to inform him that she's getting remarried (to Bellamy)  Whew! Meanwhile, Grant decides to win her back at the last minute, sucking her back into the newspaper game by tricking her into covering the last day of a man on death row.  Can't tell you what happens, you'll have to watch for yourself.If this all sounds a bit familiar, but you know you haven't seen  it, there were several other filmed versions of the play this was based on, \"The Front Page\".  The Matthau/Lemon version was okay, but avoid the painfully unfunny 80's version, \"Switching Channels\" with Kathleen Turner and that Superman fella.Veddy veddy funny.  It makea me laugh.  10 out of 10.",

Hawks finds a way to include all the dialog without making it confusing or tedious. He establishes a very tight flow for all that is going on. I almost felt out of breath at the conclusion. The actors do a superb job of not merely reciting their lines, but reacting to each other, vocally and physically. One could almost watch this movie without sound and still follow the interplay. The subtle body language and facial expressions are as perfectly timed and choreography as anything else. I really enjoyed that this wasn't just a wacky comedy. Underneath the flashy surface is a very direct satirical commentary. This film makes a strong statement on the cutthroat mentality of the press and their skewed method of reporting the \"facts\". The reporters don't actually deal with facts; they spew out opinions disguised as facts. The state of the press is not much different today. None of the characters are very appealing. They are either jackals or pansies. It is easy to forget that with all the witty banter. I think this is a highly entertaining, very insightful film. Top notch.",

Well the premise itself is engaging enough, the movie for the most part is entertaining, it definitely has some funny moments of dialogue. It even has some light moments of action which was something that I wasnt expecting. Although when it comes to the film's dialogue, it moves at such a pace it can be overwhelming at times. Seriously, if you look away from the screen for longer than a second I swear you can miss like ten lines of dialogue.There's also times where the movie can drag because of this, there were a couple of scenes where the characters fast talking over stays It's welcome. I rate movies based on their rewatchablity and it's because of that I'm giving His Girl Firday 6 out of 10. It probably deserves at least a 7 out of 10, but the odds of me rewatching this over other classic films of the 40s is very slim.",

But as this happens they find out that the mayor and sheriff were suppose to let this man go cause they got papers that said so and they didn't want anything to do with it.

Cary Grant, who plays Walter Burns, has an unbelievable wit and Rosalind Russell, plays Grant's ex-wife, Hildy matches this. The duologue between these two throughout the entire film is so fast paced and smart it's almost hard to keep up. It's as if each actor is always one step ahead of the other. Along with the acting, the storyline itself moves along rather quickly and doesn't give the audience time to become bored or disinterested. At first it seemed as if the plot would be solely centered around Walter breaking up Hildy's new marriage, but as it progresses a entirely different story is included in the film. The filmmakers did a wonderful job tieing the story of Earl Williams to Walter and Hildy's rocky relationship. The Earl Williams case brought a level of seriousness to the film which I think brought it to completely new level. In the beginning of the film the banter between Grant and Russell is quite funny but as the Earl Williams case is weaved in you begin to see a more serious turn to the movie. There are multiple scenes where the filmmakers tie comedy in with a bit of drama, for example at one point the sheriff is given news of Willaims reprieve by a bumbling assistant and the next scene is of Hildy being held at gun point by Earl Williams. The sets were also very well done, although most of the film is shot indoors the sets were so intricate and believable that I hadn't even noticed until the end of the film. Overall this film was very well done and each aspect whether it was the acting, directing or set design brought the film together very well.",

Hildy, played by Rosalind Russell arrives to tell her ex husband Walter, played by Cary Grant that she is done with the newspaper business and is getting re married. Desperate to keep Hildy around Walter invites her and her fianc\u00e9 Bruce out to lunch. Through the manipulative touch of Walter, Hildy begs to interview the prisoner who shot a \"colored\" police officer who was trying to calm him down, in the hopes of getting him a reprieve from the governor. Bruce reluctantly agrees since they were scheduled to take the afternoon train to Albany, along with his mother and he gives Hildy all their money. Hildy bribes the guard to let her talk to the prisoner, Earl Williams, who is scheduled to hang the next morning. During the interview Hildy discovers that Williams shot the police officer because he had just listened to a soap box speaker talking about \"production for use\". He said he had never had a gun in his hand before and that was the reason he shot the cop. Hildy returns to the press room to type up her interview when Bruce calls to say he is in jail. He's been set up by the ever clever Walter. Hildy bails out Bruce and leaves him waiting in a cab while she returns to the press room where her story is being ridiculed by the reporters who are there. She tears up the story, calls Walter and tells him she's leaving \"in twenty minutes\" and he can forget about the story. As she's getting her coat on gun shots ring out, all hell breaks lose and Hildy finds out that the prisoner has escaped. She forgets about leaving, calls Walter and promises him an exclusive for $450 which she wants right away. Meanwhile, Walter gets Bruce arrested again, this time for consorting with a prostitute. Hildy needs the $450 to bail Bruce out and Walter's henchman, Diamond shows up and hands her $450 worth of counterfeit money (which gets Bruce in trouble again). After Diamond leaves, Earl Williams appears outside the press room window and Hildy hides him in the roll top desk. Walter shows up next and soon after all the press show up. Williams stays hidden in the desk until Walter raps on the desk and Williams bangs back. Finally, Hildy cannot refuse her love for the scoop or for Walter any longer and Bruce and his mother go back to Albany without her. Throughout the film, the characters are constantly talking over each other, Walter is cleverly manipulating the situation to keep Hildy in town, the Mayor and Sheriff should win awards for stupidity and Walter and Hildy's constant back and forth make for some great comic relief. Underlying all the humor however is the underlying decision that women of the 1940's were forced to make; home and family or a career. It was unheard of at the time for a woman to have both. Hildy chose her career which no doubt surprised many women of the time but it was a courageous decision that many women would have loved to make.",

As the movie starts the first thing you see that stands out is Hildy in her outfit, all stripes and over the top. The next is the obvious feeling that Walter Burns still holds for Hildy, as he welcomes her to sit on his lap as he says \"there's a lamp been burning in the window for you hunny\". This becomes the focus of the movie.\nThe futile attempts of Walter makes this movie comical in the way that he tries and his creativity in which he does it, time after time. The movie turns into a whirl wind of mystery and big news stories that are combined artfully with laughs and comical jokes.",

Winning back the girl of his dreams his wife....or ex wife Hildy Johnson (Rosalind Russell). The thing that stood out the most about Cary is that he is very confident and pleased with himself all the time and that is what a girl usually likes in a man. A man that can take charge and take care of problems. Hildey is a powerful and demanding lady at her job that finds another man and almost ends up considering leaving with him. I liked this movie because at times like today, there are more movies like this that are being made and can be also related to reality situations.",

I felt bad for Bruce who never seemed to be enjoying himself except for maybe the dinner scene. I don't think that marriage would've worked out since Hildy was still so transfixed on the paper business. And in that case Walter did the right thing in keeping her there. Cary Grant's performance was good and I liked his charismatic character in this. The best part was when the fugitive was in the desk. One thing I didn't like was the end and how easy it was for Walter to talk Hildy into marrying him again. Persuading her to stay is one thing, but it took him just a second to persuade her to marry him again.",

The movie has hysterical moments in the beginning such as when Walter purposely shakes the old man's hand pretending that he is his ex-wife's fianc\u00e9. Walter was also very clever in the ways he set up for Bruce, (Hildy's fianc\u00e9,) to get arrested three times in one day. I also enjoyed how Hildy, (Walter's ex-wife) was a tough girl. She would always give her opinion right back to Walter. The only time she acted like a normal \"in-love\" woman was at the end when she decided she really did love Walter, and they started talking about the honeymoon they would now take.This movie starts off strong, with a lot of humor, but by the end it seems somewhat dragged out. The whole time Earl Wilson (the murder) was hiding in the desk just seemed much dragged out. The effects of when Earl escaped were very realistic. The gun shots and all the police cars running down the road, you feel like you are really there.",

Even though ninety percent of the movie takes place in the same room, His Girl Friday never gets boring. The film is hilarious. I loved how the characters spoke in the film, especially Walter. They all spoke really fast, made really witty remarks, and all spoke at the same time. It was like organized chaos and all of the actors had impeccable timing. I think my absolute favorite thing in the movie was the guy who showed up to deliver the reprieve. Everything he said was completely hilarious and was totally my style of comedy. The film is considered a screwball comedy, and rightly so, but it also has a great deal of suspense; the whole fiasco with Wilson's escape, his hiding in the desk, and everything that happens while Walter and Hildy try to get the story for themselves. As hilarious as these events are, they're also super exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat. The film also has a gripping love story. The relationship between Walter and Hildy and the love triangle with Bruce, Hildy's current fianc\u00e9e, makes the film all the more fun to watch. At the end when Hildy starts to cry I at first thought she was crying from sadness at losing her fianc\u00e9e, but really she was sobbing from happiness because she had learned that Walter still loved her as much as he ever did.",

This film proves the continual advancements in technology for film making. The cinematography is wonderful, as the camera enhances the story line. The story line is a little fast past, if you get up for just a couple minutes you might miss something good. Delving deeper into the script, I think it was a little bit risky to portray a woman who was recently divorced, and getting married very soon after the divorce. During the 1940's, this was not as socially accepted as it is now. However, I think incorporating something like this in a film helped to strengthen women's role in society. Overall the film was just remarkable, it keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat waiting for the next witty punch line, and Walter's (Cary Grant) behavior trying to get his wife back was spectacular. Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell clearly exhibit why they are still well renowned today, their skills in front of the camera are a huge part of why the film is so great. They seem natural and comfortable, it's easy to imagine yourself in the film with them. You really couldn't ask for more in a film.",

Nothing could keep her from it, even her fianc\u00e9 being in jail...she cared more about the paper than getting him out. And although that may seem selfish, it shows that maybe she wasn't as in love with him as she would like to believe.

It stars a snarky newspaper man in Walter Burns (played by Cary Grant), and the woman in question now being played by Rosalind Russell, as Hildy. Burns wants his old wife Hildy back, and will do anything to stop her new wedding from happening.This is what sets off the rest of the movie. It paints Russell's character Hildy as strong and self-serving, something not normally seen in that era of movies. She does however have the typical \"moment of breakdown\" however it lasts briefly and its at the end of the movie. She has undeniable chemistry with Grant's character, and it shows in any scene they have together. Especially with the director apparently promoting ad-libbing, them being able to play off of each other for their snappy, back-and-forth deliveries gives some of the best comedy in the movie.The film itself bends gender stereotypes, even though Hildy pushes Grant's jackass of a character (but somehow charming) away the entire movie, but Burns still pulls her back in at the end. After all, all the girls want to end up with the bad boys. The movie starts Hildy's perceived need to settle down, but the hustle and bustle of the old journalistic lifestyle keeps calling her back, and Burns' undeniable charm, plus a shared experience always creates some sort of spark, for instance, being arrested together.Meanwhile, her future husband Baldwin is painted as a dolt caught in another man's old desires, and is constantly being harassed in some form or another, being arrested twice. It's supposed to be funny, but it actually comes off more tragic because all this guy wanted was to get married to Hildy. A funny, snappy movie, but muddled in a dystopian message.",

It was fast but perfect at the same time because the audience was still able to follow along with ease.What was different about this movie, in which I found interesting, was they showed women in a more dominant, independent light. Movies previously to this portrayed women in a damsel in distress and less independent light. For instance, Hildy's character is always shown taking charge of every situation she gets in, calling the shots and not letting men walk all over her.

Its really hard to catch everything that is said because it comes at you so fast. The story is really well done, it starts off simple enough only to take some drastic turns and venture into serious territory only to swing right back into comedy and then take a few more twists leading up to one hell of a climax. This is a film that just builds and builds, there's so much going on in every scene, its never boring. The story also tackles some heavy issues which were prevalent at the time, things like the red scare. Cary Grant plays such a delightful scumbag who's trying to con everyone into doing what he wants while Rosalind Russell plays off of Grant perfectly matching his sleazy reporter with her sarcastic witty tough girl. Ralph Bellamy is a good straight man, he really isn't given too much to do and its a rather stiff character but he does very well with what he has. The only complaints that people may have with this movie will be a few instances of mildly racist dialogue and if you are from Albany you might not take too kindly to hearing it ripped on by Cary Grant.",

The clock is ticking on the innocent man's life, as well as Walter's presumed second chance with Hildy, so what are a couple of fine talents like Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell to do but spew out their inspired and quotable dialogue out twice as fast.

By the climax, an accused criminal is hiding in a desk in the courthouse press room to avoid a hasty hanging, with a retiring reporter and her boss helping him. But this version offers so much more.There's Cary Grant. In any other version of The Front Page \u2013 like the previous one with Adolph Menjou \u2013 before long you're filling with contempt for scheming, unscrupulous, self-centered news publisher Walter Burns. But when Cary Grant plays Burns doing those same things, we cheer him and love him for it. The gender change for Hildy was key: it works so much better that Burns' unstated goal is to get back with his sharp-tongued, perfectly matched ex-wife - not just to scam his paper's best reporter into staying on. Grant lets us in on every motivation and joke - he practically winks at the camera when he cracks wise at Hildy's boyfriend Ralph Bellamy's expense, with zingers only his dear ex-wife will get.How could we like someone who pays a thug to rough up an old lady? Someone who flatters and even hires a rival paper's reporter, just to get control of his desk \u2013 a minute later giving the order to \"kick him down the stairs\" when he reports for work? No other actor could get away with any of this, not remotely. In the last line of the movie there's Hildy, in love again and struggling to balance a suitcase over her head as they rush down the stairs. As Grant helpfully asks without breaking stride, \"Why don't you carry that in your hand?\" we forgive him one more time in exchange for that laugh.Even more important, there's Rosalind Russell \u2013 not the character she plays \u2013 the actress. Russell was so determined her Hildy must have as many great zingers as Grant's Walter Burns, she started quietly paying writers to add hilarious Hildy comebacks throughout every conversation. She delivers them without a breath or a pause, and \u2013 impossibly \u2013 without making the scene any longer. In other words, she interrupts and talks over Walter whenever she can and comes off as the sharpest wit in a story brimming with sarcastic reporters. When critics caught their breath, some credited director Howard Hawks with an innovation: uniquely naturalistic dialogue, with people talking over each other as they do in real life. This movie is full of genius from its writers - the acclaimed Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur were news reporters in the corrupt Chicago they depict, while Charles Lederer was known for making dialogue spark. Don't miss it.",

This comedy is one of those considered one of the best within the screwball department, and for good reason. The movie is all about Walter and Hildy, a divorced couple whose relationship really never worked out for them and now Hildy is going to get married again to man named Bruce Baldwin. In the file, the dialogue is lightning paced and flows quickly from one character to the next without a break in between. I wanna say this is a classic of madcap rom-coms, featuring some of the funniest, fastest dialogue ever written, and Cary Grant's performance is just genius.",

            "content": "Personal Rating: 5/10 (Average)I wish I could chalk up my dislike for this movie to it being overhyped as 'the Grant classic that you must watch.' Yes, high expectations helped it fall further, yet the faults I find lie more in that there was hardly a single line of dialogue that wasn't shouted (please find me just one line). As well as the complete and utter lack of character arcs, with Hildy Johnson regressing past the point she was proud to have worked to at the onset of the film.This movie had great dialogue, don't get me wrong. Fast, snippy and smart. Yet for a movie relying entirely on the dialogue, it fell flat. It had a major lack of visual storytelling, character arcs as was touched on. Nor any real consequences behind any of the actions. Relationship, didn't matter. Going to jail three times, just illustrated the same useless point over and over. For a film that stood out among others of the time in portraying the strength of women, with Hildy knowing what she wanted and working towards it as well as being gifted and well respected in her secular field, she was still pushed into a relationship she didn't seem to want (again!) at the end of the movie. With the last line of dialogue hinting at that, erasing any progress made up until that point. And the whole execution attempt going on during all of this, seemed merely just a confusing subplot that was there only to motivate dialogue and chemistry (If you could be so generous as to call it that) that furthered to develop between Hildy and Walter.All said the acting is superb by Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell. So if you're going through all the Grant movies, chuck 'His Girl Friday' a watch, but otherwise, I wouldn't waste my time.\"Walter, you're wonderful, in a loathsome sort of way.\"",

In this film they both truly shined and worked so well together, Grant played Walter Burns, a big time editor for a major newspaper called the Morning Post and Russell played his former star reporter and also his ex-wife!. Hildy Johnson (Russell) is about to marry Bruce, an insurance man, and they are planning on moving to Albany NY to live a quiet and peaceful life. Walter (Grant) isn't too pleased with the idea and talks Hildy into writing one last article for the paper, as she was the star reporter. The three characters get involved in many different situations mostly revolving around Walter's fear of letting Hildy go, some funny and some pretty serious with a twist. All in all this movie was really great and it was great to hear of a local place (Albany) in a big time film such as this.

At all.This is supposed to be a romantic comedy, we're here to watch the relationship overcome obstacles and that's what you've sold us. So why on Earth do the main characters completely separate for FORTY MINUTES? The entire movie is only ninety minutes long! Aside from one brief all-business phone call, the people who are supposed to finding their way back to each other haven't shared another second of screentime.

Romantic couples are constantly finding new ways to fall in love with their loved ones or their ex partners,such as playing tricks on their partner's other romantic lover just to get their original partner to fall in love with them again.Sometimes,the male or the female would have to go out of their way to make sure that their partner don't have any feelings for anybody else so that way, they can keep their romantic life to themselves. Lies and tricks are horrible ways to get people to like or dislike you or put people in slander. Only when the truth comes out does romance and friendship become pure and faithful, and the couple will like each other for who they are.The filming and lighting in this film had gotten more advanced and better in 1940. There were a lot more panning in and out of the main characters with dramatic lighting on their faces that would create suspense and dramatize the scene. There was more cast shadows and reflected lights that almost looked as if they were created by real natural light on the wall, in a few scenes. The movement from scene to scene was more fluid and moved at a fast pace to give the film a more dramatic feel and make it more frantic and conveying the urgency of the character's actions and motives in the film, especially the news that was being shown throughout the movie within the narrative. The comedy was brought to a standstill throughout most of the film, except for a few awkward scenes with Grant, Johnson, and Baldwin.The comedy that was briefly showed flowed well through the film in a dialogue realistic manner. The acting in this movie was excellent. The narrative and plot of the film jumped around too much between the romance issues, the lying, and the main focus of the story that needed to be simplified into one main narrative that could have been easier to follow.Either than that, it was an okay film to watch.",

Advertised as a romantic comedy, starring one of my favorite actors whose romantic comedies I have always enjoyed, I fully expected this movie to be another classic romp like Bringing Up Baby, I was a Male War Bride, Arsenic and Old Lace, or the Philadelphia Story. Instead, after the opening scenes introducing the characters, nearly all of the humor seems to be mean-spirited and manipulative, or very darkly satirical. The only romance the main characters engaged in was with their own egos and the thrill of hunting down sensational stories, abandoning sense, decency and professionalism along the way.It may be possible that I'm simply lacking some crucial context that would cause any of this to make sense, but I found this film to be very distressing, even disturbing at times. The scene with Mollie's introduction I thought was rather poignant, with how guilty the reporters looked and acted afterwards, but for the rest of the film, they completely disregard any of that remorse and fight over every scrap they can get, eventually leading to a fatal or near-fatal tragedy. I cannot imagine how a distraught young woman leaping out of a high window to protect her confused and terrified friend from being murdered for political gain could be construed as comedy, or how I could empathize with the main characters after how callously they regard the whole situation. There were other faults I found but that was the moment I started feeling a bewildered hatred towards this movie.The acting is great throughout, I must say, but I've never liked despicable protagonists. I can abide antiheroes with a soft spot or two, but the only positive trait His Girl Friday's main characters have is cleverness and that's just not enough.",

Director Howard Hawkes' camera flits around the claustrophobic set (entirely in the Press Room of the local police precinct where unjustly condemned prisoner Williams has been bound over for 'justice'to the corrupt Mayor and his henchmen) creating heightened tension which finds release in the barbed wit (Sample: \"Say, I hear you're consorting with Stalin now?\" \"Yeah, they say you wear red underwear\" -- would anyone under age 30 even catch the reference to 'red,' an early (and pejorative) term for Communist -- from the red of the former USSR's flag)? But never mind -- there are few dated references; most of the dialog is as fresh and clever today as it was in 1940. And the plot -- as newspaperman Grant tries to woo back ex-wife Rosalind Russell -- unfolds as easy on the eye as on the ear, with quick-reflex performances from the leads and rollicking assistance from Hawkes' impeccable style and deftness with the camera.

Howard Hawks delivers an adaptation of Ben Hecht's play, The Front Page, that is funnier and more fine tuned than most comedies today. This film's influence is still felt today with movies like Clerks and Pulp Fiction with their quick and witty dialogue.From the beginning, this film will hypnotize you with its ultra fast dialogue. The exchanges seems so meticulously rehearsed and prepared. Characters hit their lines with complete perfection and air-tight pace. There is probably ten seconds in the whole film where nothing is being said. This masterful use of dialogue can easily be credited to director Hawks, but it is the performance of Cary Grant that drives this film. He plays a corrupt, immoral, and unethical newspaper editor who forces us to like him. The entire film shows us how evil a newspaper can be but it shows us from their point of view. This enables us to empathize with Cary Grant and his staff. They lie to and set up Bruce Baldwin. That should make us dislike them and position them as the villains of the film. However, Cary Grant's performance is so engaging that we end up admiring the level of power he has and the intelligence he displays. He takes what would be a villain in most movies and makes him likable. He almost acts as a lawyer or politician with how slick he is. His upbeat delivery of lines and dry humor show the dialogue in another light, from his point of view. His intentions are to serve his newspaper and his ex-wife, Hildy. This film should be re-released today so people can see what real comedy is. Not just some random and pointless comment that makes no sense we can't help but laugh. That seems to be what comedy is today (Family Guy, Dane Cook, Seth Rogen, etc.). His Girl Friday is a smart comedy with relevant jokes that build character.Go see it.",

The film was so good that I found it interesting. When I first heard of comedies like this, it really got me getting into some laughs. I remember a lot of moments when Walter and Hildebrand (a.k.a. \"Hildy\") were together, and that was when I knew that something was going to happen. It really got me into laughing at a lot of what they do. It seems that people have been loving comedies, whether they're shows or movies, and people would want to see them again. It will keep saying, \"Watch me again!\" in my mind.",

Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell have great chemistry on screen and do a fantastic job at making the crazy relationship between Walter Burns and Hildy Johnson a reality. The fast pace of the film makes the hour and half fly by, although the insanity between Burns and Johnson does get a little tiring after a while. It becomes obvious after a short period of time Johnson divorced Burns, but his antics makes him a lovable fool. The script writing is fantastic! The jokes range from witty puns to very clever political cracks. The costume design was good. The only notable costume pieces were Burns' suits and Johnsons hats. Overall the film is a successful screwball comedy, but I could have done with less shouting and people talking over the top of each other. It made the film difficult to understand at times and took away from the films quality.",

Even though this movie was made over 50 years ago, I still found the comedy to be funny, I caught myself laughing more than I thought I would. Howard Hawks used short and quick humor to his benefit. Cary Grant starred in this movie and he did a great job just like he always does; Rosalind Russell also did her part to make this film a classic. Both of them carried themselves in a recognizable comedic manner. A bit about the movie, Walter and Hildy are a divorced couple that can not work together. Walter wants to be back with her but she already has another man. Walter wants Hildy to work for her again and write a story on a murder case but she keeps denying him. This gets the two into a hilarious and entertaining pickle.

The realistic dialogue between him and Rosalind Russell as they play ex-spouses Walter and Hildy adds a lot to the sincerity of the comedy in the film. In fact, it's so fast-paced that the jokes alone seem to be moving the story along. When the other noise factors are considered, including (near constantly) ringing phones and the like, it can get almost overwhelming.Sound as an emotional tool is something that I'd find more typical of a dramatic film. But the stressful, fast-paced, noise-filled aspects of this movie (that permeate what would normally be portrayed as some simple, straight-forward situations or conversations) has a lot to tell about Walter's personality, Hildy's true nature, and the often morally ambiguous (or often just corrupt) life and career of \"newspaper men\" that the film warns the audience about right in the beginning. It was completely effective in doing so, but it honestly made me very anxious, which took away from some of the jokes.The jokes themselves, while witty, were sometimes quite topical, and I felt it aged the movie a bit. The story of things getting exploited and spun out of proportion by the press however, is fairly ageless.The cinematography itself was very straightforward. Visually, there weren't too many artful decisions. Not in costumes, framing, light, etc. This was not exactly disappointing, however, as it is a straightforward comedy and to expect a ton more seems unfair.",

They were deliberately told to be as fast as possible for effect. The pacing is probably one of the best parts of this film, as it matches the stereotypical \"news reporter\" quickness.

Both the acting and directing of this film are both top notch work and really help pull everything together in the plot. I found it interesting that a comedy movie could dip it's toes in touchy subject matter (murder, execution, suicide) and still be funny from started to finish especially in the 1940's. The nice mixture of romantic comedy and satire help the flow of the film as do the supporting roles. Another great screwball comedy from a golden era of movie making.

I couldn't help but notice is in His Girl Friday. Hawks creates the semblance of a dance between the characters of the film. It start with how fluid the dialogue is between characters. Characters start talking before another character finishes, it sets a wonderful, fast pace for the film. Hawks doesn't stop there though. he doesn't let the characters just talk to one another, he moves them around the environment they inhabit. Occasionally interacting physically with each other and the objects in the surrounding environment. It matches the pace of the dialogue to a tee. What this does is draw the comedy - often biting in this case - from the seemingly benign scenes. It is a testament to how to effectively construct a comedy out of a story that does not necessarily need it. And that's just it, it's hilarious.

There's some really insane comedic moments in the film that make the film fun as it is, such as the brilliant chemistry between Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell and the insane, super fast talking used throughout the picture, but it's not a perfect film. I didn't care too much for the behind the scenes frame-up news story that plays a major part in a film. It just seemed too forced in what's supposed to be a comedy. Another scene where a character commits suicide also seems out of place in a comedy. But like with other flawed films, when Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are on screen together, sparks fly and the film's extremely fun to watch.It may not be the greatest screwball comedy ever made (I have a higher preference for Bringing Up Baby and You Can't Take it With You), but Howard Hawks delivers in making an enjoyable film nonetheless.",

            "content": "Rather than posting a bit of the synopsis, although I might reference some scenes and such, I just want to say: ANYONE WHO ADORES COMEDIES, PARTICULARLY SCREWBALLS SHOULD WATCH THIS. I really loved it although I'm not sure if there was much chemistry between Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell. Like most screwballs I've watched, this one also sets place in a newspaper publisher (The Morning Post), which already sets up the stage for people talking over each other and quick dialogue. Russell is Hildegaard (Hildy), the ex-wife of Grant, who is Walter Burns the editor of The Morning Post, and of course, it's obvious that Walter is going to try to get Hildy back. And like most screwballs, Hildy already has another man! While the story is quite predictable, it's the acting on Russell's end and sometimes Grant's that makes this film great. I knew what was going to happen, but the quick dialogue is what kept me watching. I could have cared less about the whole newspaper story, but I couldn't keep my eyes off of Russell. Grant had some great moments when he would make these weird groaning/moaning noises that were perfect for the scene. Ralph Bellamy plays Bruce, and of course, he is the guy Hildy is going to marry, but if you've watched some screwballs, you probably know what happens to Bruce in the end. There was a great line when Walter tells one of his assistants to find Bruce and when he describes Bruce, he says, \"He looks like that fellow in the movies - Ralph Bellamy.\" I should be on the look out for more movie references in screwballs since I noticed one in Bringing Up Baby as well. It was nice to see Ralph Bellamy again since I saw him in The Awful Truth as well and he pretty much played the same character, which made me chuckle a bit. And how could I not mention Howard Hawks in this post, right? For those who don't know, Hawks is a well-known director by film buffs and has directed numerous famous films. Maybe you know him as the director of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (you know, the film with Marilyn Monroe singing \"Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend\"!) but let me tell you, he has never disappointed me with any of his films. I loved how he used some subtleties like in a scene when Hildy, Bruce, and Walter are at a restaurant and with the things they ordered and their actions, it was as if it was foreshadowing the ending of this film. First it starts with Walter deciding what he'll get and Hildy simply saying that she'll get the same, and Bruce kind of goes with it as well. Then both Hildy and Walter take out cigarettes and when Hildy lights a match, Walter simply drags Hildy's match over to his cigarette and Hildy gives him a look of annoyance and then lights her own cigarette. I noticed that Bruce didn't smoke in the scene and then Walter orders coffee with rum and Hildy gets the same thing, but Bruce says that he doesn't want it. After watching the film, I realized that the scene (the one I just mentioned) was the film in a nutshell. At the beginning, it all appears to be that the three characters are on an equal plane, yet it is Walter who orders first in a forceful voice and when Hildy orders the same in a simple manner, it was as if ordering the roast beef sandwich was something they usually did and was nothing new to her. Then when they both start smoking and Walter doing the thing he does with the match, it's like bringing Walter and Hildy together and finally with the coffee, it is solidifying the bond between Walter and Hildy while Bruce is in the outskirts. Well, that's just my interpretations of things, but I thought that Hawks directed that scene and the rest of the film incredibly well. I highly suggest that you watch this film if you're up for a good laugh. The DVD I had was by some company called D3K or something and the transfer was HORRIBLE so if you plan to buy the DVD, don't buy the one from them.FILM BLOG - http://sachlichkeit.net",

The antagonist is a strong woman named Hildy Johnson played by Rosalind Russell. It is great to see an independent woman in a film taking place in the 1940s. The dialog starts off incredibly fast and stays that way. I feel that much of the humor is created by confusion. The film slows towards the middle. The press room scenes (where most of the film took place) had me falling asleep. I found some topics not so funny such as suicide. The film lacks the silliness that is found in other screwball comedies, it is not worth checking out.",

You learn things about the past and how things used to be through old movies such as these. The plot was great and it had several twists that you never see coming. I feel bad for the main character a little but later you learn that everything works out well. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and recommend it!",

It was very fast paced, but their dialogue was quick and witty. The dialogue had to be fast because life in a newsroom is always going at 100 miles per hour.

For it's time, the film was an entertaining marvel. Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are irresistible and really the strong points of this movie. Their chemistry and fast paced responses keep the film moving.Because the newspaper industry is prevalent in the film, many of the characters are affected by this and thus, the actors have a tendency to speak rather quickly. This works for comedic effect but some viewers may be turned off by this fast paced dialog.Ironically, the film felt slow for me at certain points. I believe however that this just might be a personal fault, as I'm used to watching so many modern films.Overall however, this is a great film for those who are fans of the screwball comedy genre.

Then, there's the final scene with the murderer, where they hide him inside a desk to avoid his detection.

It was remarkable how quickly they were speaking throughout the movie. It was as if the script was twice as long as anticipated and they had to babble through to finish it all. The speed adds comedic value, though. A lot of times throughout the film people were talking over each other to create a more realistic context of conversation when arguing or excited about something.

I thought that they both played their roles amazingly, as Cary Grant is a master at the screwball genre. The film includes a very fast-paced environment, much like what a real life reporter's daily life would be like. The characters spoke very quickly, and this film is the first/ one of the first films to ever have characters talk over one another's lines. This created a more authentic experience, making it seem as if this were a real life discussion instead of one created by writers. The comedy was driven through creative dialogue, as Grant's character had many deadpan lines throughout that you had to really pay attention to understand, as did Russell. The love story seems to take a backseat, so that we could truly appreciate the humor and delivery of the characters. The photography was great, and it being from 1940 caused no issues in terms of the smooth editing. The lighting wasn't dim, and we could see what is happening quite well. The mis-en-scene was wonderful, as each scene included accurately dressed characters, and nice background props to give a sense of where they actually were. The movie took place in only a couple of rooms, and they were very simple. There was not too much going on to distract the audience, to ensure that Cary and Rosalind were rightfully the center of attention for the entirety of the film.",

While the Communist jokes are so obviously irrelevant today (just a part of the times) the quips and comebacks are still sharp and witty.

Rosalind Russel's Hildy Johnson demands your attention as soon as the film starts. With her front and center of the camera, and an outfit that stands out, Russel's performance is immediately exciting and with it brings that same excitement throughout the film. For being 77 years old, this film's comedic material still holds up, however the aforementioned pacing can produce issues. Sometimes the jokes come too fast, and it can be difficult to register them all. In addition the normal dialogue can be lost in the motor-mouthing that practically every character exhibits. While it is entertaining and without question, rather impressive that the actors can speak so quickly, it loses something in the process. These quick remarks come frequently and as a result the dialogue can be hard to relate to. It loses a sense of realism when every character is rambling on so quickly. Nobody talks like this, and if there were only say, one or two characters (like the main leads) that spoke this way it'd be less of a problem. However, as it stands it does lessen one's enjoyment.

It's ostensibly a comedy; Grant and Russell do have great chemistry. But at the same time, the major question of the movie (released in 1940!) is whether or not a woman (a divorc\u00e9e at that) wants to forego her passion for her profession or become a mother. And while the sheriff is a buffoon is cahoots with the mayor, their willingness to kill a man for political gain speaks to a level of corruption we've all to expect from our elected officials.

The reporters want a scoop, the Mayor and Chief want the black vote, the Governor wants to be popular, the girlfriend wants to be noticed, Hildy wants the rush from beating out everyone else. From my viewpoint it's a stinging indictment of newshounds (and as relevant as ever today) but Hawks was a pragmatist and he plays it as a nutty comedy as everyone scrambles over everyone else fishing for the best angle. Screwball comedies of sexual dynamics and goofy situations were big in the late thirties and early forties, with films like It Happened One Night, Bringing Up Baby or The Philadelphia Story, and stars like Grant, Katharine Hepburn and Carole Lombard made their reputations with them. If they have one major attraction, it's the leading ladies' potential to let rip and Russell does not disappoint, with a fantastic ear-chewing swaggering tour-de-force performance as she out-shouts and out-mugs a very funny Grant, a sort of acting equivalent of a headbanging hard rock guitar solo.

You can see the camera would follow the character all through the office to show how busy and hectic people are working. It really gave you a sense and feel of the setting. Overall, this is one of the best films from this era I have seen by far.",

            "content": "This film by Howard Hawks was brilliant. The characters were believable in the sense that they seemed exactly what you would expect from Newspapermen(and women) and balanced each other well. The movie went by fast and people could argue that it went by too quick but I would disagree. The director did it perfectly. The fast paced film showed the life of a reporter and how those who weren't a part of that world would get swept to the side but if it was your world you would thrive. The camera didn't move much with interesting camera angles and such but it did a good job of zooming in and out and showing the entire scene where certain characters were concerned. The by far best part of the good use of the camera was when Hildy and Walter were talking on the phone and it would swap back and forth. It didn't do it in a way that would make you dizzy but in a way that gave you a good picture of what was happening and of the conversation. The actors all helped because even though things would happen really fast you could understand them. The film wouldn't have been successful without the cast they used because they really helped bring the feel of the film to life and in the mist of all the confusion they made it clear through organized chaos. The movie was fast paced with fast talking and would have multiple conversations going at a time. It was great how the director could capture the conversations and the most important parts. The film gave a great portrayal of the journalism world, corruption within a government, and (yes cheesy but it was part of the film) a quick but accurate view of working men and women getting caught up in their jobs causing them to neglect their loved ones. It showed lying and sarcasm, and so much between the lines that swept the viewer. I would recommend this movie and am definitely going to watch it again in fear I have missed things. It was brilliantly done with characters, accurate portrayal of things, and the camera work limited though it was.",

The actors really must have worked hard in order to talk that fast. Hildy Johnson was married to Walter Burns but their marriage burned out as quick as they talked. The fast paced talking and changing story convinces us that this movie is about journalists. One of its messages is that the media has a great effect on the government good or bad. This is shown when there is a manhunt for a fugitive who is supposed to be hanged the next day. He escaped and somehow the journalists heard he was in a house across town where he used to live. The police used the rifle squad to try and take him down but in reality he hadn't even left the block. The escape is a panic manufactured by the media. And the media portrayed him as a homicidal maniac. Also this man was obviously mentally unstable but due to politics they had to make an example of him. The movie is hilarious throughout keeping it moving as fast as possible. His Girl Friday is a very good fast paced comedy movie that never stops its flow.",

Considering the feminist movements in the early-mid 1900s, this movie can come across as a misguided attempt to suppress feminists. The love interest, Walter, is manipulative and crass, and there is no reasons at all for Hildy to have changed her mind at the end, save for a wild stretch for a classic rom com ending. The rapid fire dialogue is annoying at best.",

They all seemed to talk to each other just fine without any fighting which surprised me. I liked how this movie was fast paced because it really made the movie come to life. The seriousness of the movie made it very suspenseful. The seriousness had me hooked to watch the rest of the movie.Right from the beginning I knew that Hildy was going to miss her ex-husband because they communicated very well, and worked together to try and make the paper the next big thing. What shocked me was when Walter kissed Hildy before she was \"leaving\" to go to Albany. It shocked me because Hildy was supposed to get married the very next day.The only thing that I didn't like about this movie was that it was hard to understand in the beginning of the movie since there was so much going on.on a side note, why did Hildy change her hat after the first scene from a striped to a solid color hat?I would rate this movie a 9 out of 10",

Without giving too much away, the entirety of the time the camera spent in the Press Room was complete chaos to the point where it just because ridiculously hilarious. Considering how this movie was produced in 1940, I still can't help but think about the volumes that it speaks about today's press. I mean, let's be honest, it is still an utter mess! My last thought has to be about the love story.

This movie is a great example of the type of comedy I like best. Hildy and Walter are my new favorite movie couple. They're both just super intense, amazing at what they do, and by the end they both have a pretty decent idea of what they want. Watching the movie its easy to tell they probably aren't great for each other, but I can't help but hope that after the end titles, the relationship would have worked (if it were a real relationship).

While they both fit the roles they were given perfectly; I do feel that together their performances sort of tug at the limelight one way or the other in a number of scenes. This, at least to me; kind of muted their respective charisma's; at least until the second half. By the time the second half comes around, the characters gel together much more seamlessly. Having come into this with little idea of what to expect; I was pleasantly surprised when the climax of the movie made its' appearance. The moments where his 'Con-man,' persona comes to light are hilarious; his talent to make an innocent bystander feel guilty for something that Carey himself has done wrong is pure delight.

I also found Cary Grants character to be just annoyingly selfish throughout this movie and really didn't care for his wife or what she wanted and would only be satisfied if he got his way.

Rosalind Russell plays Hildy Johnson, a popular, respected and successful journalist who decides to leave the journalist life behind and settle down with her new husband in Albany, NY. Cary Grant plays Walter Burns, Hildy's boss and ex-husband who cant bear to see her leave the company. Throughout his numerous attempts to change Hildys mind, I realized how extremely manipulative Walter can be if he needs to. He is outwardly very charming but always has an arterial motive. I was also amused by the banter between the journalists, always going back and forth . They treated all things as just a potential story to the point that they ask the mayor to reschedule a hanging so they can have a headline about it. in fact, all of the dialogue was interesting sue to it being so fast. I even looked it up and the director wanted to break the record for most words said in a movie, which really shows. Nearly every conversation is a witty exchange of words that keeps you entertained, even though things happen very fast. I think this movie was very good, I just wish they talked a little slower at times",

It was neat to see that some of this film took place in my hometown on Albany, New York, and getting a look at the 1940's version of the city was very cool. The dynamic between Hildy and Bruce is very funny and seeing him obsess over her is a fun and engaging dynamic. The screwball comedy aspects were fun at times but I found many that didn't land for me which is where my disappointment with the movie lies. The ending is well executed, with the implication that the cycle will repeat all over again, and this was a high point of the movie for me. Overall however, I just didn't think many of the jokes landed, but it was still engaging enough to be worth the watch.",

The fast paced and witty dialogue is a rarity today and is very funny and enjoyable. However, this may be one of the few times where I would have preferred a non-traditional, sadder Hollywood ending. The the suspense that builds during one of the final scenes in which the killer is hiding in the desk, would have really paid off if the squabbles ended in an accidental killing of the insane killer instead of everything working out. Although that may sound gruesome, it would have been a perfect way to resolve the petty bickering between the characters during such an intense scene as it would have put the whole situation in perspective. I guess that would have made it a different film. The film we do have is still very enjoyable, even to a modern audience.",

Meanwhile, her ex husband, and the newspaper's editor, does everything in his power to win her back. It's a pretty interesting and rather original set-up. The plot is very busy and fast-paced, most likely to mirror to chaos of a newsroom. The humor is also very quick, consisting of witty, conversational one-liners and wise remarks, so some of the jokes can definitely go over your head. Regardless, the film is hilarious. My favorite line is when one man asks another, \"you always carry an umbrella? Rubbers too I hope,\" while motioning to his rubber rain boots. A lot of the humor still holds up today. His Girl Friday, while surely comedic, is also a satirical look into the press at that time. You can tell how corrupt the industry, or at least this company, is. The lengths some of the reporters go to get a good story is absurd. I really enjoyed this film and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh.",

The film was very lively and entertaining, while moving at a faster pace but keeping the audience interested. The relationship in the movie is that Hildy Johnson has an ex husband, Walter Burns, and she is now engaged to Bruce Baldwin. I believe the height of comedy in this movie, for myself is how even though Hildy has harsh feelings towards Walter and has moved on, she still knows him very well. For example, she has Bruce give her all of their money to hold on to, and when she is on the phone with him tells him to put his check in his hat. Later, Bruce realizes hat his wallet among other things were missing. This proves that Hildy was right and still knows her ex husbands character. This also shows how smart and independent she can be, which is a very positive outlook on women, especially during that time period.",

This film has you laughing at just 10 minutes into the film and has you laughing until just about the very end of the film. Has a basic but decent story to it, nothing too intricate but also not dull in a sense.

Through out the whole movie you expect Hildy to be with Bruce but the last minute she ends up with Walter.

The dialogue is very fast paced, but done to perfection.

The characters aren't trying to be dead serious, so their over the top nature adds to the somewhat mocking nature of the genre. I also think the strength of Hildy as a character helped to make the movie more enjoyable and believable. She wasn't constantly fainting or acting helpless like many female characters of the time, which seems pretty unnatural in modern times.\nWhile most screwball comedies are meant to be just that, comedies, I found His Girl Friday to be more sad than funny. While there were plenty of funny jokes and exchanges, the underlying mocking of the callousness of the press seems all to relevant nowadays and I couldn't help but root for Hildy to get out and leave with Bruce. Instead of finding her constantly getting sucked back in by Walter funny and comical, I found it disheartening. Perhaps I am taking the movie too seriously.

This film was one of the first to utilize overlapping dialogue and it worked really well. Alongside the overlapping, the fast paced dialogue moved the story and character development along in a coherent way that allowed us to see what each character was like & how they behaved. Also, the fast paced dialogue made certain parts of the movie very funny. The characters skipping around in conversations allowed them to quickly say comedic things that worked well with the situations. Some of the characters did seem to be kind of annoying and unlikeable, but I overlooked it because the movie was funny and enjoyable because of how those characters were portrayed.",

This corny movie could not make it today, it is just over rated and I am disappointed I sat through this whole thing.",

This also saved the film from feeling over dramatic at times. Many of the scenes in this movie were very long but I felt it was great content because of the comedy in the movie. The acting of Hildy was done brilliantly and I felt that this movie must have felt very empowering to women at the time because of what Hildy was capable of achieving in this movie.

Despite the characters being more likable, the genre of the screwaball comedy is just so uninteresting to me, which severely hindered my enjoyment of this movie.

It is also interesting to note the cultural norms of the day. Rosiland Russell plays a no nonsense reporter who is the equal of her former husband and newspaper editor, Cary Grant. The movie is interesting for the use of a \"battle of the sexes\" theme that is actually a courtship ritual for a woman who is a independent as Russell.

I had to re-watch this movie 2 times to fully understand every part in it. I was happy that I watched this movie 2 more times because I missed a lot of the little funny humor that is in it. This is an excellent screwball comedy for the Great Depression Era, you can see how most of the characters are middle class while Hildy is Extremely Wealthy. My favirote character was Bruce. Bruce is so nice but he gets played and used so many times by Hildey and Walter which is hilarious. Bruce doesn't understand that he is just being pushed around.

The quick choppy conversation leads to quick misunderstandings that cause you to laugh just a little bit. Cary Grant plays the roll of Walter to perfection. Even just the scene where he meets the new husband for the first time, the mistaken identity on the older man get the audiences to burst out laughing. Walter carries on during the rest of the movie with the audience knowing all he's trying to do is get Hildy back and this makes for the great comedic action. Everything that Bruce is put through adds so much irony. He looks like a really upstanding guy but as soon as Walter gets his tricks going it becomes just a series of amusing situations for the audience.",

The writing is superb, masterfully crafting a battle of jibes between two great actors. The other characters of the play, the story and setting, all seem of little importance to the rapid fire exchange between Grant and Russell. The speed, timing, and wit of the film are first rate. The speed of delivery is enough to make the dialog in West Wing seem like a slow tugboat ride to China. If you are in the film or theater biz you need to buy it, trust me. It amazing how casually the actors pull off the comic timing, you'll find yourself watching it again many times just to catch all the hyper-speed jokes. It definitely deserves a place in the top 50 films of our history if not the top twenty.",

Becoming for more involved than she first intended, Hildy is swept up in a whirlwind involving her family and even the governor, all the while Walter uses the desperate situation for his own means. Does he succeed? There is nothing that stands out significantly in the cinematography. Perhaps the most distinguishing part of the image is the lighting.",

Excellent acting accomplished by the prisoner (hiding in the roll top desk) and his girlfriend throwing herself out the window to distract the press pool located in the very same second story room. Reminds me of \" Bringing up Baby \" with a role reversal for Cary Grant. Whereas Kathryn Hepburn plays the trickster.

Walter Burns is the big editor of a newspaper and has less than 24 hours in order stop the departure and the imminent marriage of one of his best reporters who ...by the way...happens to be his adorable ex-wife!In order to do that he invents every possible trick in order to keep her by convincing her,in the first place, just to postpone her departure for a couple of hours in order to cover a scoop..but that is just the beginning...!Rosalind Russell is absolutely perfect on the role of Hildy Johnson, Walter's ace reporter and ex-wife, using sophisticated and hilarious lines in order to outsmart Grant's intelligence and she proves to be an equal opponent on this perfect and romantic battle.In my opinion,the battle of the sexes can turn out to be an excellent way to unfold a love story under the condition that is promoted in a clever way and \"His girl Friday\" is just one of the best examples.The chemistry of Grant and Russell is radiant and depicts perfectly the electricity between the two exes who are too proud to admit their feelings to each other!One of the best of screwball comedies ever made ,\"His Girl Friday\", definitely deserves 10/10.

Turning \"Hildy,\" into \"Hilda,\" and throwing into the reporter-editor relationship the complication that they are ex-spouses who are still in love (sort of), seems sappy.Yet, this is the exception. Having seen several versions of the original \"Front Page,\" including the Pat O'Brien/Adolphe Menjou film and the later Jack Lemmon/Walter Matthau movie, I feel that the Rosalind Russell/Cary Grant \"His Girl Friday\" edition is in fact a huge improvement. The romantic subplot doesn't distract, it truly enhances the fun, and wit, and cynical sharpness, and allows Ralph Bellamy (the would-be new husband) to really get to join the comedy. Of all the adaptations of the play, this one is truly the wittiest, quickest, most rollicking, without losing the moments of darkness that do show up in the play.Don't miss the tiny gems: Cary Grant referring to a story about a suicide, Archie Leach (Grant's birth name); Grant telling \"Bruce\" that he looks like \"that fellow, what's his name, Ralph Bellamy\"; Billy Gilbert, John Qualen, and Gene Lockhart (as Sheriff Peter \"pinky\" \"B for Brains\" Hartwell) turning in perfect little performances in lesser parts.",

She asks the secretary where the boss (her ex-husband) is, once the secretary said do you want me to get him for you, she said no, I'll let him know myself. So right from the beginning of the film you get that this woman is in charge. Also having a female protagonist, itself was rare for the times. Statistically is rare now days also. But not as bad as before. As she was about to go meet with her ex-husband, Bruce, her now romantic lover offered his protection to her if things get rough. But she down played it by saying \"oh\u0085 I'll come running\". As if she is a damsel in distress. But this was in a sarcastic way and the audience gets it right away. Once she gets to meet with her ex-husband, we quickly find out that she was the one who divorced him. Yet another indicator that she is the decision maker in the relationship. And later at the lunch scene we find out that the reason for her leaving him was probably because he slapped her. Thus the reason she chooses to end the relationship. After that the first incident or luck as one might put it, took place. Sweeney (a writer at the press room) was having a baby and this caused Walter (ex-husband) and the head of the new paper, to ask Hildy to stay and do the story for him. This is when we finally find out, why Hildy is there. This is the most important part in the movie, because Hildy is there with an agenda as we find out later in the film. Her decision to let Walter know that she is engaged, about to get married and leaving town tomorrow, sets in motions the events that follow. Once we put one and two together based on her actions towards Walter and Bruce, we quickly find out that she is trying to get Walter jealous. She still has feeling for Walter, but Walter is not the guy she can trust. Thus she uses Bruce, a well-rounded gentleman, to pull the strings and play with Walter's emotion. So as you can see, Hildy is in charge during the entire film based on her calculated decisions. A couple of seen that come to mind that was empowering for women were; when Hildy was being referred to as \"newspaper man\" meaning she is as good as any men or equal. When Hildy walked into a press-room with guys playing poker and calling them ladies and telling one of the guys that he could be her bridesmaid. And finally the scene where she tackled the guy to the ground. These were very empowering scenes considering the times. The character development in the film is also interesting. Hildy wants a traditional guy but she is not a traditional woman herself, nor is Walter. Thus at the end of the movie she finally goes to the honeymoon that she never had, but with some compromises.",

It was genuinely funny, which already caught me by surprise, and it was a fast-paced and frantic film. The continuous dialogue and witty comments kept the film interesting. However, despite being a lovely film, it has its flaws. Seeing the film in 2017 and not in 1940 could alter the expectations I had for this film. The first one would be the relationship Walter had with Bruce, I'm uncertain how different my perspective would alter the 1940's context, but through my modern day perspective, I found it strange how understanding Bruce was of Walter and Hildy. I'm unsure whether that was supposed to show the Bruce was a bleaker man compared to Walter; that he was just a boring insurance man. Compared to Walter, who lies, manipulates, and cheats to get what he wants. Yet, I still find it odd that a man would let another man say he loves his future wife and acts horribly towards her without anything negative reflecting consequences. It's confusing how this was meant to be interpreted. Was this a way to show Walter as a caring and loving man from a comedic point of view? Or were the viewers supposed to think that Bruce was a chump who didn't deserve Hildy?Another thing I dislike about this film was the ending. When Hildy decided to remarry Walter despite him making empty promises, I was left with the feeling that their second marriage was going to end for the same reasons the first marriage ended. I disliked this so much because I truly thought that Rosalind Russell portrayed Hildy Johnson so brilliantly; she quickly became my favorite character in the film. A memorable and vibrant character, who was also the funniest. I was rooting for her to have a better, more suitable ending for her character. Having her start crying because of Walter's manipulation (where he immediately stopped wanting her as soon as she wanted him) halted the mood of the film. The ending was ruined for me personally, due to the fact that Walter spent the whole movie dominating her and standing in her way. Only to see Hildy being mistreated all the way through the end.",

            "content": "\"Once upon a time\u0085\" usually acts as a precursor to fairy tales and other fictional stories. Though beginning with this phrase, His Girl Friday presents no fairytale to the audience, but rather a romantic comedy sopping with farcical reporters, bickering, and trickery. Cary Grant's somewhat stiff physique relays a slight emotional distance from his costar, Rosalind Russell, but through other effects, such as parallelism, their film consortium rekindles. Hildy Johnson (Russell) and Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy), when juxtaposed to Hildy and Walter Burns (Grant), relate a safe, lackluster relationship. Hildy and Walter possess similar qualities that draw them closer chaotic scene after chaotic scene; they both smoke, express assertion, and lust for current news. Early in the film, when Walter treats Bruce and Hildy to a multi-intentioned lunch, opposites clarify as the men battle for Hildy's attention. Bruce chooses not to smoke but Hildy and Walter do; this emphasizes merely one of the various differences between the two men in Hildy's life. Mother's boy Bruce seems light-years away from independent Walter. Through the dynamic grouping of Hildy and Walter throughout the film, His Girl Friday foreshadows that they will end up together. This technique of grouping can provide the inclination or extrapolation to audiences of possible outcomes; and I find it beneficial to the plot of the film because relationships in my own life could be better if I find similarities within them. Puffing smoke will not save the relationship on its own, but the parallelism launches the plot and pulls the hard-hitting journalists together for their whirlwind of a chase.Hildy's dynamite of a character certainly asserts herself and stays one step ahead of all the shenanigans Walter tries to pull on na\u00efve Bruce. Intelligent, independent Hildy portrays a more masculine woman, especially set in the forties, as she presents herself as career-oriented firecracker. Her souped up outfits complete with suits and fedoras flashes her personality as she works alongside men. Gender tension commonly appears in 1940s films, and His Girl Friday presents this with Hildy acting out of social norms, especially as a female reporter. Though Hildy contradicts many common characteristics of her time, she still gleams as the leading lady vulnerable to love. In the end, her heart goes to the man that closely reflects her qualities and fits into her intense personality best.Constant ringing of telephones, uneven window shades, and, at times, bustling reporters allude to chaotic undertones of the film; tumultuous conversing ensues as light-hearted murder looms. Layered banter and verbal sparring transform the film into a dialog-driven story, and much of the film contains scenes of confabulation rather than imagery and action. The scene at the very beginning of the film where Hildy tries to communicate to Walter that she will marry Bruce the next day works effectively within the plot because of its realistic nature. I also find that in conversation trying to explain myself and not knowing how to deliver my message quickly and to the point can further delay the inevitable. Especially evident through Mollie Malloy (Helen Mack) and her accusatory complaints, the film portrays journalists as cynical, hyperbolizing people, nearly dehumanizing them. Thus another chaotic-like facet of the film emerges through the fa\u00e7ade of the journalists.Altogether the film presents a stream of laughs in an ocean of words as the characters juggle a murderer on the loose and controlling local officials.",

            "content": "You'll need subtitles just to catch all the fast talking, transatlantic, double talk. \n\nDirector Howard Hawks' romantic comedy His Girl Friday (1940) is very humorous, but also kind of too chaotic to even make sense. The entire movie is every character yelling over one another in hectic double talk sequences. Hawks' direction looks fine, but I found myself horribly lost in the pointless side stories and not really enjoying the stressful double talk and randomly serious drama that critiques unethical journalists that just lie for headlines. \n\nHis Girl Friday wants to be a smart satire, romantic comedy, screwball comedy, and earnest melodrama and so it only accomplishes all of these to a moderate extent. It's too cluttered. The simultaneous conversations seems like a neat gag, but when it's the only real joke, His Girl Friday failed to make me belly laugh until Billy Gilbert's Joe Pettibone character showed up. His Girl Friday felt longer than 92 minutes, honestly.\n\nIt's sort of funny as writers Charles Lederer and Ben Hecht's script is clever and full of wit. But the endless talking around matters is obnoxious and incredibly hard to follow. The charismatic performances bring all this stream of conscious dialogue to life. His Girl Friday is not very romantic as Cary Grant is practically the villain, manipulating his ex-wife into getting back together with him in a relationship and at work. I found Grant's character sexist and overbearing like his only redeeming quality is that he's Cary Grant. \n\nCary Grant is excellent as Walter Burns, but I don't like seeing Grant as a sexist newspaper editor. He's casually cruel and manipulative with his endless lies and deceptions. He is fun, but Grant is better as the nice everyman rather than a fast talking con man. Everyone talks quickly with Grant's same Transatlantic accent, so Grant doesn't even stand out vocally as much as normal.\n \nRosalind Russell is charming, but gullible herself as Hildy Johnson. I feel like she's introduced as a smart independent woman, but she gives up her family life and fiancee for a man that treats her terribly. If all she wanted was a career, that's fine, but Grant gives her no reason to fall in love as they're barely on screen together. Ralph Bellamy is fun as a completely gullible fool named Bruce Baldwin. He's almost too stupid to believe. Abner Biberman is fun as the con artist and thief Louie.\n\nJohn Qualen is touching as the wrongly convicted death row escapee Earl Williams. He's far too sincere for a comedy as these serious scenes drag the tone and pace down considerably. Helen Mack is shockingly moving as Mollie Malloy out of nowhere. She's the only person that cares about the man about to be wrongly sentenced to death. Billy Gilbert is hilarious as Joe Pettibone, who delivers the pardon of the criminal. His boisterous laugh and charming personality are very funny as the clueless fool. He elevates the film considerably.\n\nGene Havlick's editing could have cut this down into something slicker. It's fairly slowly paced for how much talking takes place and how short His Girl Friday is actually. Joseph Walker's shots are pretty flat as it looks like a play rather than a dynamic film. It's all wide shots with a few choice close-ups and medium shots to freshen things up. I thought the camera held too long in the same place to really hold my attention. \n\nComposers Sidney Cutner, Felix Mills, and Ben Oakland wrote a fairly forgettable score that's slightly lively, I suppose? Lodge Cunningham impressively mixes all the voices together so that you can clearly hear what each person is saying despite them talking over one another. Robert Kalloch gives Rosalind Russell a crazy patterned suit and Cary Grant a neat tailored suit. Everyone else has regular suits of the era.\n\nIn all, I am a bit disappointed by His Girl Friday. It is funny, but not nearly as hysterical as it should have been.",

There is always something happening, though Hawks dedicates a surprising amount of time towards darker moments that haven't seeped into the film's reputation - criticisms of the police and judicial systems, and particularly the press and yellow journalism (a woman literally attempts suicide due to the mischaracterizations of a group of backroom wordsmiths, and it stops the film dead with sobriety for a moment). The plot is convoluted, but that's part of the point - that Grant's Walter would go to such bizarre lengths to create the opportunity to preserve his relationship with Hildy (Russell), as faking phone calls gradually escalates to harboring a convicted killer. The fast-paced dialogue and consistent one-liners and brisk jokes often make this film seem like a slightly more fleshed out, romantic version of a Marx Brothers film, though championed by a magnetic performance from a single actor rather than a trio. Funny, short, and distinctive, His Girl Friday is still an absolute must see for both fans of classic film and those just looking for some entertainment value. (4/5)",
