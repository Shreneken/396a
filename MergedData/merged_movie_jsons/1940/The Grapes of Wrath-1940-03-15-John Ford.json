            "content": "John Ford's film of John Steinbeck's novel has deservedly a classic film mirroring the views of both men and the times the book was written and filmed. Ford won his second Oscar for Best Director and Jane Darwell was the Best Supporting Actress of 1940.For most of America the Depression started with the stock market crash of 1929. But for the farmers it really began at the end of World War I. Those were good years for agriculture, the war in Europe was a boom for agriculture. But when farm prices dropped after the Armistice, a whole lot of family farms went belly up. Lots of people left the farms for the big city and industry jobs. The Depression years unhappily coincided with some of the worst drought ever seen in America.This is what many families like the Joads were facing in 1939 when the book was written. The banks had foreclosed on land that had withered to dust in any event. Folks like the Joads picked up and moved elsewhere, like California on a rumor of prosperity and jobs. America was still changing from an agricultural to an industrial society back then. That causes a lot of trouble for people unskilled in any industrial job training. As a country we're going through something similar today in many areas. We're moving from an industrial to an information based economy. Industry jobs are being lost to other nations and older and poorer workers are suffering for it. It's progress I guess, but it takes its toll.Some factory worker who has lost his job for any number of reasons can identify to some degree with the Joads, especially if they've lost a home they owned. For the Joads it was worse because they made their living off the land for many generations, identifying with it in a way that industrial workers could not.Henry Fonda got his first Oscar nomination for Tom Joad. To get the part which he knew he was so right for, he signed a studio contract with 20th Century Fox. That caused him many problems later on, but those are stories for another film review. Tom Joad is a midwest country kid, a whole lot like Fonda himself. Part of the story of The Grapes of Wrath is Tom himself trying to figure out why these economic forces are crushing him and his family and the way of life he's known. In the end when he leaves the Joad family and hits the open road, he's not got all the answers, but he's asking the questions. Tom hasn't figured it out, but a lot of people with many letters after their names haven't either. He only knows that he's got to get in the fight for economic justice.Jane Darwell was in films from the earliest silent films to Mary Poppins in 1965. This became her career part and the mother role of all time. She's what holds the Joad family together in good times and bad. That's what moms do and get little recognition for it. Except in this case by the Motion Picture Academy.John Carradine has his career part in this also. Another John Ford favorite, Carradine plays Casy the defrocked preacher who as he tells it disgraced himself with a female parishioner. After that preaching the gospel didn't seem quite right. When Fonda meets Carradine after Fonda's been released from prison, Carradine is asking a lot of questions about what is man's place in the metaphysical scheme of things. He's developing what we would now call situational ethics. Carradine's questions are on a higher plane, but he certainly inspires Fonda to ask for some answers himself.The Grapes of Wrath illustrates that at least government can give first aid in a crisis. After being in privately run agricultural camps where they're treated like less than dirt, the Joads happen upon a camp run by the Department of Agriculture where at least they're treated like humans. As it turns out, the Secretary of Agriculture was one Henry A. Wallace who was running for Vice President that year with Franklin D. Roosevelt. I'll bet any number of people saw The Grapes of Wrath and saw a message of support for FDR and the New Deal.Given some of the problems of the American economy today, The Grapes of Wrath though it appears dated isn't really all that much a relic of our past. It's both a timeless book and a timeless classic film.",

            "content": "The Grapes of Wrath is the story of the Joad family, who are run off of their land in Oklahoma because of drought and poverty. I think that one of the most striking elements of this movie is the black and white cinematography. Obviously, there wasn't a lot of variation on this particular subject in 1940, but especially today, the lack of color enhances the feelings of poverty and desperation and emptiness due to the family's loss of their home. In this way, because it would not be nearly as noticeable in 1940 as it is today, this time-enhanced effect of the black and white film stock has allowed for the film's impact to actually grow with time. Henry Fonda plays the part of Tom Joad, a young member of the family who is released from prison at the beginning of the film, only to find that his family has been driven from their home and is staying at his uncle's house until they can figure out what to do about their sudden homelessness. It is by pure coincidence that Tom was released early on good behavior, otherwise he may very well never have seen his family again. He finds them in a state of near desperation, as they begin more and more to realize the predicament that they are in. Their trek across half of the country, on their way to California to assume jobs that they've heard about, provides for a substantial portion of the plot and is extremely well-structured.\nThe family encounters every hardship imaginable on this journey, from family members dying to their struggle to feed themselves to their rickety old truck constantly breaking down. They run into disillusioned people who claim that they've been to California and there are really no jobs there, at least not nearly as many as there are people going to look for them. They are periodically and derogatorily referred to as `Okies,' a term which places them in a broad category of poor folks driven from there homes in middle America who are traveling to the coast to get jobs that aren't there. There is so much doubt and hardship presented that it is never really certain whether they really will find jobs. The audience is never able to assume a happy ending, because there is so much contrary foreshadowing throughout the film. The struggles do not abate once the family reaches California and takes up shaky residence in residential areas that would be more accurately referred to as shanty towns, and the rest of the film is dominated by the family's efforts to survive in a new and unfamiliar place, while working for wages that are barely sufficient to prevent starvation. Ma Joad spends the majority of the film stressing the importance of keeping the family together, seeing it as the only thing that they really had left, but this is eventually set aside in favor of each member of the family not only surviving but also flourishing, which provides for one of the many powerful messages that the film delivers. The Grapes of Wrath is not exactly an edge of your seat film, but it is a shockingly realistic portrayal of the suffering that so many people and families experienced during the Great Depression. The performances are flawless, and the experience is not only powerful and moving but also educational. It's no secret that most people do not watch movies to learn, but there comes a point, at least once in a great while, when a person should watch a film that requires a little mental thought processing, and in such cases, The Grapes of Wrath is an excellent choice.",

            "content": "It's difficult on a first viewing of \"The Grapes of Wrath\" not to be somewhat disappointed with it. So much of Steinbeck's beautiful novel is left out of the film, and it's hard to see his story and characters wedged into the \"gee whizz\" style of film-making so prevalent at the time. But once you get beyond a comparison of the movie to the book, you begin to realize that John Ford created a beautiful piece of work of his own, and the film inspires a great deal of admiration, and deserves credit for its gutsiness at tackling a story that wouldn't have gone down smoothly with film executives at the time.Of course the most controversial parts of the book are left out (like its final image, for example), but Ford still managed to work around the constraints forced upon him to fashion a hard-biting film. Henry Fonda is perfect casting for Tom Joad--never have his otherworldly eyes been used to greater effect. And Jane Darwell is pitch-perfect as Ma Joad--she captures the tough-as-nails dignity that the character has in the novel. The whole movie is lit by expert cinematographer Gregg Toland, who uses shadow and reflection to cast a ghostly pall over everything. Indeed, much of what Ford wasn't able to include in the film as words he communicates instead through images, and isn't that what a good book-to-film adaptation should do? One of those films that feels ahead of its time.Grade: A",

            "content": "In rural Oklahoma, Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) is walking and hitchhiking home from prison, after a stay of four years. After taking a knife at a dance, Tom hit the attacker with a pan, killing him. Nevermind that it was self-defense, Tom still gets sent to prison. He hasn't heard from his parents, Ma (Jane Darwell) or Pa because they aren't the \"writing types\". A fierce dust storm makes Tom's final few steps treacherous. Arriving back at their small cabin, where his family are sharecroppers, Tom and his passing friend, Casy (John Carradine) are startled to find no one at home. A shell-shocked neighbor informs the other two that the family has been kicked off their land in foreclosure. They are nearby at Uncle John's house, where his family is about to suffer the same fate. Its the Depression and the Dust Bowl has ruined the land, taking off the top soil; no one can grow crops. When Tom catches up with his Ma and company, they are overjoyed to see him, for their plans are to pack a truck and move to California, where handbills show pickers are needed. Grandpa doesn't want to leave the only home he has ever known, so they drug him with medicine and haul him along. Now on the Mother Road, route 66, the journey is difficult; the truck breaks down frequently, no one wants them to stay long anywhere they rest, and Grandpa dies of a stroke. Will California really be the Golden, Promised Land? NOT ON YOUR LIFE! This heartbreaking adaptation of Steinbeck's classic is a must-see for the whole wide world. This family of hard-working folks has one calamity after another, just trying to earn an honest and living wage. Those who lived in the Dust Bowl part of the country were hit especially hard, as the soil had been overworked and winds took the topsoil off, creating damaging storms to crops, humans, and animals. No better were the \"lies\" of the handbills, advertisements that migrants were needed in California, where over 300,000 poor helpless folks showed up for very few jobs. The cast, with Fonda at the helm, is wonderful as is the scenery, costumes, and careful direction to show the truth of a desperate situation. Wanna get down on your knees and thank the Lord for what you have, Americans? You will when you view this amazing film!",

            "content": "During most of the decade of the 30s, the United States lived under the shroud of the Great Depression, a decade of unemployment and high poverty that would changed the face of the country forever. While the entire country suffered the effects of the Depression, the inhabitants of the prairie lands had to face an extra difficulty: the Dust Bowl. The Dust Bowl was a terrible ecological disaster that destroyed many farms in the area of the Great Plains, and forced people to migrate looking for better working conditions. The difficulties and social problems that those migrants had to endure in this sad chapter of history became the inspiration for John Steinbeck's novel, \"The Grapes of Wrath\", a book that quickly became a classic due to its powerful depiction of the era. Soon after it's release, plans for a film adaptation began to be made, and the man who would bring the novel to the screen would be none other than John Ford.In \"The Grapes of Wrath\", Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad, a young man recently paroled from prison who is traveling to his family home in Oklahoma. When he arrives, he discovers that the farm is deserted and the only person he can find is Jim Casy (John Carradine), the former preacher of his community. Together they decide to go to the house of Tom's uncle John (Frank Darien) looking for the Joads, and it's there where they find them packing their belongings as they get ready to move. The Joads explain Tom that the bank has foreclosed their farm, and that they are moving to California looking for work and a better life. While he is not supposed to leave the state by the conditions of his parole, Tom decides to join his family and convinces Jim to go with them in the long and arduous trip to California. However, things won't be as easy as they thought they would.Adapted to the screen by Nunnally Johnson, \"The Grapes of Wrath\" takes on the spirit of John Steinbeck's novel and delivers a harsh, crude and very realistic portrayal of poverty during the Dust Bowl. Despite not being an exactly faithful adaptation of the novel (changes were done due to censorship), the movie remains true to that powerful and very human essence that the novel had, and it could be said that Johnson distilled the themes of the novel and made an unabashed story free of any political compromises. While this kind of stories often suffer literary embellishments, \"The Grapes of Wrath\" avoids stereotypes and shows humanity as it is, with all their vices and virtues. It is the excellent development of the main characters what gives that very human touch to the story, as it really shows a real understanding not only of Steinbeck's novel, but also of the real social situations that inspired the book.In 1939, John Ford was in one of the best periods of his career, having directed \"Stagecoach\", \"Young Mr. Lincoln\" and \"Drums Along the Mohawk\" in less than 12 months. \"The Grapes of Wrath\" would also be shot the same year, being the culminating work of that extraordinary series of masterpieces. While Ford was better known for his legendary westerns and larger-than-life heroes, \"The Grapes of Wrath\" was in many levels a very personal movie for him, so he basically took Steinbeck's novel and completely made the story his own. Framed by Gregg Toland's wonderful cinematography, Ford brings to life the Joads' story in a way that mixes his own style with a focus so realistic that almost feels like a documentary. Without excessive sentimentalism, Ford tells in this movie a very human tale of survival, so universal that could easily be related to any group of people migrating due to poverty.While Ford and Toland deserve a lot of the credit, the movie wouldn't be the same without the extraordinary performances of the cast. Leading the cast is Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, delivering one of his best works of acting in his portrayal of the young man. Considering his performance in Ford's \"Young Mr. Lincoln\", one could say that Fonda's career reached legendary status under Ford's direction. While Fonda's work is worthy of praise, two actors actually manage to overshadow him in this movie: Jane Darwell and John Carradine. As the idealist preacher Jim Casy, Carradine makes a terrific job in what's probably the story's most interesting character, completely embodying Casy's persona in an atypical role for him. Like Carradine, Jane Darwell makes a wonderful job (probably her finest) as Ma Joad, and without a doubt she truly deserved that Academy award she received for her performance.As written above, the movie has several considerable differences with the novel (specially the second half), so fans expecting a complete translation of the book will be a bit disappointed. However, Johnson and Ford did a wonderful job in the adaptation than while considerably different beasts, both the movie and the novel carry the same spirit and the message that Steinbeck tried to give in his book. Interestingly, producer Darryl F. Zanuck also saw the film as a personal project and certainly his involvement helped the movie to get away from censorship as most as possible. While the film has indeed some flaws (most famously the sudden and unexplained disappearance of a minor character), it's hard to diminish its value due to them, as the beauty of its craft is so big that they can be easily dismissed.With a haunting atmosphere, a beautiful visual composition, and superb performances by his actors, Ford created one of the first masterpieces of the 40s and one of the finest American movies ever made. While already a celebrated director by the time of its release, this movie consolidated Ford as a master of his craft. Despite their differences, John Ford's \"The Grapes of Wrath\" truly carries the spirit of Steinbeck's novel, as well as the ghost of Tom Joad. 10/10",

I thought about this movie during the recent Real Estate downturn and what the banks did in real life was indeed captured in this movie way back when. Indifferent, callous, and greedy while practicing their rights leaves one with a bad taste in the mouth and we bailed them out if that isn't the gall of galls.

John Ford, with this nifty little film, made the greatest argument for populist/socialist politics in cinematic history. This movie understands the Depression and the Dust Bowl and the poor and the hungry and the starving and all those people that the sign at Ellis Island (or is it at the Statue of Liberty?) says that we'll take on and help. It understands those people better than anyone or anything else I know. Steinbeck's novel helps this movie get to where it needs to be, but, let's be honest, the Grapes of Wrath is all John Ford. The sweeping vistas, the excellent editing and pacing, and the acting are of the highest caliber, as befits a John Ford film. I'm amazed every time I see this movie just how moving it is without straying into trite sentimentality. Tom Joad's speech at the end always makes me cry--his chilly delivery of the word homicide at the beginning continues to give me a prickly spine. Fonda was a great actor, and he is certainly at the top of his game here. Without him, interestingly, the film would have probably floundered. No one else could have possibly played Tom Joad; no one would have that charm and charisma and, most importantly, that voice. The rest of the cast is amazing, don't misunderstand, but Henry Fonda is Henry Fonda--an actor unto himself. There is no one like him and never will there be; he is the single most watchable actor of all time. And this isn't even my favorite John Ford movie! Nevertheless, it's a great film with a great message. Call me a pinko (it's been done before), but what's superb about this movie is its humanism. Yeah, the ideology promotes a type of socialism (ahem, I mean, let's not forget that that is basically what the New Deal was and if you think that system was a bad idea, then fine), but, really, the movie is about caring for people who don't have the resources to care for themselves. Grapes of Wrath is not a scathing indictment of anyone; it's a simple portrait of a family's struggles to overcome the Depression. It's uplifting and shows a real feeling for the downtrodden, and that's more than you can say about most American films that intend to deal with the poor and hungry.",

Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell are well-remembered for their roles, which are among the defining roles in their careers. The only limitations that it has come from the original novel, with its heartfelt but sometimes contrived story.Besides Fonda and Darwell, the supporting cast features plenty of good supporting players, including Charley Grapewin and John Carradine. All of them make their characters come alive believably. They also fit together well and complement one another's performances, which accentuates the themes involved in the struggles of the Joad family.For all that the Steinbeck novel is so revered, and for all that his story is an often compelling depiction of its characters, with whom many in the era could identify, it would have been better if it had not been so heavy-handed. Even given that the times were bad, more balance in the characters outside of the family, and in the Joads' experiences, would have made it an even better story. Certainly, this is barely even noticeable when compared with the stories in many present-day movies and novels, which often dispense with any attempts at plausibility.And that does not stop this adaptation from being a worthwhile and often moving film. Ford clearly appreciated the potential in the material, and he and the cast work together to make each character count, and to give meaning to each scene.",

That is why it was remarkable that Oliver Stone was able to capture the \"feel\" of Viet Nam (in \"Platoon\") so soon (13 years) after America's withdrawal.  Usually, an honest perspective takes more time to develop.But, when you consider that John Steinbeck and John Ford needed less than ten years to bring the 1932 \"dust bowl\" to life, you really have to admire their magnificent achievement.    Of course, in 1940, Ford could not film much of the graphic squalor described in the novel.  For example, the film cannot show a starving hobo suckling at the breast of a young Rose of Sharon, who has milk to spare following the death of her baby.  But, far from degradation, Rose of Sharon's gesture is a reflection of the goodness that resides within her, and that quality is well illustrated in the character development seen on the screen.  Tom Joad may be an ex-con, but he is a good man.\nOne of the commentaries (below) uses this film to rant about the exploitation in today's society.  That completely misses the point.  Ford, who was as conservative as anyone in Hollywood, even more conservative than John Wayne, used this movie to show that Man can triumph, despite the natural and human barriers that are put in his way.   \nThis is ultimately a movie about hope and the human spirit.",

I will tell a short version of my personal life to let you know how it affected me from my own experience of growing up in the ThirtiesI think their must have been more then one car because ours was full of stuff in the back seat, clear up almost to the roof. Frankie, Bill and me (my brothers) all was on top of the stuff in the back seat, had to stay lying down was not enough room to set up. What I remember most about the trip was it was awful hot when we went through Arizona and we had not much water, the water we had was in a canvas bag, hooked to the front bumper to help keep it cool. We did not get much because dad was saving it for the car when the car got to hot. Mom told us to suck on pebbles, and we did. It was a bad time every where. No jobs or anyway to make any money. We were going to California because their was suppose to be some picking work their, after we got to California we saw miles of potatoes all loose piled up high my guess would be about six feet high, they had put lime or something that looked like lime it was a white powder to keep people from taking them to eat.We found a place to pick plums that they used to make prunes and we lived in a Quonset hut made of corrugated metal setting on a concrete slab. The public toilets were near were we stayed, Joe and his wife (Family friends)had their own Hut\u0085this was the time that dad & Joe would sell tickets for people to watch them box each other in a ring at the recreation hall on the property. Also they joined a baseball team and played baseball, dad played left field. We got to watch them play for free.Seems like Frankie and I played together a lot don't think Bill did because he was still a baby his self, Doris and Dorothy (my sisters) was still crawling so Bill could not have been very old at that time. Frank & I would go pick up plums off the ground and we would bring them home, Doris and Dorothy would set in the box and eat them. You can guess what they would look like when mom and dad got home, their was no air condition back then so they would take a hose and squirt water on the tin Quonset hut to try and cool it off some, I know when we went west we looked like those grapes of wrath folks in the movie.That area was the first time I ever saw a frog walk, it was to hot for them to hop, when they tried to hop their bellies would touch the ground ( gravel) and would burn them, any way that's what we thought at that time. I saw the movie of Grapes of wrath a long time ago, and I remember it so well, I cried most of the time it was on because it reminded me of the hard time we all had back then, I was born in Oklahoma and it was just a terrible time in the late thirties I would love to see the movie again, its to me a history of my family, I am 71 1/2 years old now and still remember it very clearly.Gene McDaniel",

            "review_title": "The definitive Great Depression film",
            "content": "Classic Hollywood films that tried to tackle important issues or answer big questions, typically were cheesy and hard to take seriously. They had gratuitous overacting, fake \"Hollywood\" dialogue, and just general over dramatization. Since these films are typically over-dramatized in this way, their attempts at having a deeper or meaning or some sort of a message are ruined. But not all classic Hollywood films fall into this abyss of clich\u00e9s. And the ones that don't are still remembered and cherished to this very day, films like Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, or Modern Times, or 12 Angry Men, faced serious social issues at the time and succeeded. Films like these are unforgettable and in many ways life changing, and John Ford's Grapes of Wrath is one of these precious films.As I'm sure you all already know Grapes of Wrath is an adaptation of the John Steinbeck Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name, that was published only a year before the film was first released. The novel is one of the greatest of the 20th Century, and I highly recommend that you should check it out. The film and the novel are both about Tom Joad, (played by Henry Fonda, who collaborated with John Ford several times.) who returns to his family's home in Oklahoma after spending 4 years in prison, but unfortunately by the time Tom Joad makes it out of prison, the country has fallen into the Great Depression. And the Joad family were unfortunately sharecroppers, so of course the bank repossessed there home and land, and the Joad family are forced to head west to California to look for work. But as they get closer and closer to California things begin to seem hopeless as they learn the truth about what is going on out in the west. If I were to choose one word to describe The Grapes of Wrath it would be haunting, so many scenes and lines of dialogue send shivers down your spine and make tears grow in the back of your eyes. I won't spoil any of these fantastic moments, but dear god the combination of John Steinbeck's masterful writing and the actors's somber performances combine to make these scenes and lines of dialogues absolutely devastating, you will be thinking about them for weeks after you watch the film. The cinematography (done by the legendary Gregg Toland, who also was the cinematographer for Citizen Kane.) is also outstanding. Shots of the deserted houses in Oklahoma, the wide open road on highway 66, and the overcrowded filthy slums of California, all give The Grapes of Wrath a bleak depressing atmosphere. Every single actor in the film gives it his/her all, Jane Darwell won the Oscar for best supporting actress for her role as Ma Joad, and Henry Fonda was nominated for best leading actor. And while these two performances are just perfect, every single roll in the film no matter how small is also perfect. (well, except for some minor child-actor roles.) John Ford is an excellent actor director though, so this should come as no surprise. John Ford also won the Oscar for best director, this was his second Oscar (his first was for The Informer.) and it is well deserved, each scene is meticulously crafted to dig real deep into the audiences emotions and not in a way that feels cheap by exploiting the audience or something. No instead of going for cheap shallow emotions the way an Oscar-bait movie would, Grapes of Wrath instead has characters that don't even feel like characters that are going through actual struggles, there is no cheap manipulation in this film. It is 100% genuine.John Ford was a strange person for 20th century fox to pick to direct The Grapes of Wrath, because he was politically conservative and the book/film supported several liberal political ideas like strikes and unions. But John Ford was definitely the right choice. (see what I did there.) Grapes of Wrath was one of the few American films that was allowed to be released in the Soviet Union,it was only allowed because it supported pro-communist ideas. But it eventually had to be pulled from The Soviet Union when Soviet audiences saw that even dirt-poor begging Americans could still afford cars. In 1989 The Grapes of Wrath was one of the first 25 films to be added to the national film registry, alongside films like Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Casablanca. And it deserves its spot there, Grapes of Wrath has become the definitive Great Depression film, and should be viewed by everyone.9.5/10",

The Remainder of the Strong Ensemble of Acting all do Excellent Work and the overall Verisimilitude of the Film is Striking.Gregg Toland's Haunting and Beautiful Cinematography Captures the Mood of Melancholy and the Film as a Whole is Widely Considered one of the Great Films.Some Film-Scholars even Rank it \"The Greatest\". This of course is Obviously Objective, but suffice to say it is always a Contender when the Category of \"Best\" or \"Greatest\" arises.

            "content": "I'm will be there\u2014to review John Steinbeck and his great American novel, The Grapes of Wrath, about the westward migration of people during the dust bowl in the Depression of the 1930's. It was a huge hit in 1940, and soon it was turn into a movie directed by John Ford. The film stars Henry Fonda as Tom Joads, the incredible Jane Darwell as his mother. The film stands today as one of the finest examples of sensitive American cinema. It is an incredible combination of gut-wrenching scenes threaded through feel-good scenes that make you laugh and then sob. The movie is about The Joads family. They were destitute by faceless, corporative banks that seized their lands just when Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) got out of prison. Forced out of their farm, the Joads are heading from the dust towns of Oklahoma to California for hope of a job. As aggressively coaxing is needed to acquire Grandpa Joad (Charley Grapewin) from leaving his abode, while the family meek existence is depended on the nurturing of Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) who's strong upbringing sturdily holds them together. When the family arrives upon destination, they harbor terrible living conditions and given low wages in the migrant-worker camps. Hot tempered Tom Joad eventually collides with the wrong side of the law, as he is cornered to leave his family behind. A documented-style production in which seasoned pioneer John Ford received an Academy Award for his appraised directing. The Joads suffers much, and struggle in times of adversity. The visuals of the film, was outstanding. The desolation of the land and the desperation of the people were depicted very well. It does have an uplifting message despite its gloom. A black and white cinematography that would inspire Ansel Adams. Tom Joad's speech is very powerful, and makes you appreciate every meal you have. The idea of the interpretation of the film is that despite being in hard times, the Joads gave to others. Letting others stay with them, helping out others, giving away their food. The faults of the film are these\u0085 it's really heavy, slow tempo, long, and the Okie accent and dialect is hard to understand. Some harsh language in the book that wouldn't have been allowed in mainstream movies of that time is left out from the movie. The production codes did not allow for the shocking scene of a woman breast feeding a starving man that ends the book. In the book more detail is given about Tom Joad's older brother Noah. In the movie he's hardly featured at all, and in fact completely disappears from the latter part of the film with no explanation given as to where he went. The big difference between the movie and the novel is that the movie goes uphill while the novel goes entirely downhill. This makes all the difference. The uphill fashion of the film version fails to provide closure. For example, it lacks the powerful ending of the book, which I will not spoil. Anyways, this film and book should be read and view in EVERY school to show how lucky we are today and don't appreciated it with our many luxuries our money buys today. It doesn't belong 2 a particular era or country. It's the story of the struggles of humanity.",

            "content": "In which John Ford holds up John Steinbeck's black mirror to America at the end of a decade which started with the Stock Market Crash, continued with the Great Depression and ended with the nation contemplating its world position as Europe entered into war. The question posed by Steinbeck, amplified elegantly here by Ford, is what happens to the little people, the working class, indeed the underclass who get squeezed the most when the checks and balances in society break down. It's also about how fickle human nature becomes when the haves indeed have power over the have-nots and how cheaply some people can sell their humanity to maintain that superiority.The story is naturally episodic but the simple journey that the Joad family has to undertake to the much heralded promised land of California after being evicted from their land by the bank gives the movie a natural flow, although with this tale there are many more ebbs for the family to endure.My criticism of other Ford films has sometimes been the sentimentality and forced masculine humour he frequently inserts but there's no room for either of these traits here. The nearest we get to one of his familiar tropes is the weekend dance at the \"clean\" government camp at which the Joads eventually arrive and are for the first time treated humanely by the staff, but even amongst the high spirits there's danger in the wings as the state troopers seek to gatecrash the party to make an arrest.While there are twelve in the extended family which first hits the road, there are only eight of them alive by the time they reach the relative safe haven at the end as the elderly grandfather and grandmother expire on the journey and two others drop out. The main characters though are Henry Fonda's Tom Joad, the family matriarch Ma Joad played by Joan Darwell and the idealistic lapsed preacher Cristy, played by John Carradine. They each come to very different ends but the film does at least conclude on a vaguely optimistic note with stirring speeches of defiance and even hope by Fonda and Darwell, both of which in fact were interpreted by the soon to be all-powerful House Un-American Activities Committee as evidence of a Communist propaganda subtext.Oscar-nominated Fonda is excellent as the combative, already road-hardened Tom, just released from jail for killing a man, who soon becomes the head of the family and so supersedes his father and his father in the hierarchy. Darwell won the Oscar as the Mother Earth character whose indomitable spirit drives the family on while Carradine memorably portrays a man who has lost his faith and who now channels his energies into human rebellion.Ford (and screenwriter Nunnally Johnston), even if he does bend to the box-office by editing and tweaking events in the book to afford at least a smidgeon of optimism at the end, treats the text in a starkly realistic almost quasi-documentary style as befits the seriousness of the subject matter, aided in this by the masterful black and white photography of the acclaimed Greg Toland. The sense of abject poverty is manifest in the way Ford and Toland frame their cast's often gaunt portraits against dark skies and blasted landscapes.This classic movie is a literary adaptation, history lesson and cry for social reform all rolled into one.",

Tragedy and betrayal beset the Joad family from the outset. But it is nonetheless an uplifting movie. Spirit, compassion and tenderness mark them out. Fonda's role is particularly understated, and we see, as in Steinbeck's masterly epic, the maternally robust figure of Ma holding the family together.The performances all round are wonderful, and Ford's direction and sense of space under the big sky of the Midwest is breathtaking.This film is now largely a testament to the time in which it was set, but like the war movies that were soon to follow, a story that needed telling lest we forget.",

            "content": "The movie itself is generally recognized as about as good (or great) as you can get, especially considering that it was shot in 33 days. But it often gets nailed for two scenes, one absent from the film, the other changed drastically. No Rosasharn is not seen in the film nursing the dying old man from her swollen breast. If the scene had been shot in 1939 (or even suggested), the movie would never have been released. The second problem often pointed out is that the ending is too upbeat, what with Ma Joad's carrying on about how men live their lives in jerks while women flow along like Anna Livia Plurabelle, and \"we're the people that live.\" That last scene was written by Zanuck and was almost essential to a successful film in the late 1930s. Of course tragedies had been filmed for years, but ordinarily the tragic hero or heroine had earned his or her fate. Both audiences and authorities would have waxed wroth seeing an honest close-knit family crushed by an American economy that was totally inimical to their welfare. We need to look at art in the context of its time.From the Marxist perspective that Steinbeck used in writing the novel, Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) is the protagonist but the two most important characters are Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) and Casey the Preacher (John Carradine). Ma represents what Marx called \"false consciousness,\" the tendency to attribute our misery to our own flaws, to bad luck, or God's will. Ma Joad's solution is retrograde -- to hold the \"fambly\" together. Casey, on the other hand, discovers \"class consciousness.\" It's not our fault. The flaw is systemic, and the solution lies in correcting the inequities in the system. Our allegiance has to transcend groups like the family and embrace all the exploited workers. The film endorses not Marx's revolution but a milder form of socialism -- the government-run labor camp with its democratic \"sanitary units\", and the emerging union movement with its collective bargaining. Steinbeck's polemic is more acid. The novel has a reference to the extremely wealthy William Randolph Hearst (better known as Charles Foster Kane) who is described as have \"a mean face and a mouth like a a**hole.\" There aren't many references to communism either in the novel or the film, just a few remarks about \"Who is these Reds, anyways?\" Still pretty bold stuff for the 1930s with the public in one of its periodic Bolshevik scares!No need for anxiety, though. By the late 1930s the Great Depression was easing up, and World War II was about to bring it to an end. Bakersfield now looks as if Tom Joad had made a successful escape and decided to open a chain of organic food stores. This is a marvelous film. To single out just one shot, note when the Joads drive through the first starving Hooverville. The camera is mounted on the front of the old truck and travels slowly, without any cuts or dialog, through groups of wary, singularly ratty looking people, men and women, young and old, some resembling photos of criminals from old Police Gazettes, who \"don't look none too prosperous.\" If nothing else, the film is a valuable corrective to the current view that people are poor because they're lazy. How did one third of a nation become so terribly lazy in the years following the 1929 stock market crash?",

            "content": "The Grapes of Wrath was impressively released less than a year following the release of the novel and yet within this short timeframe director John Ford crafted one of the greatest motion pictures ever made. A number of John Ford's movies have that foreign film feel - a feeling of very raw, lifelike emotion. The Grapes of Warth itself is one of the most emotionally draining films of all time with one scene after another drawing up such feelings of pity; everything is rough, dirty nor is there makeup on any of the actors. Just take the scene in which the depression-ridden Joad family on their way to California attempt to buy bread from a dinner (a scene which really puts the value of money in perspective) - The emotion is one part humility and the other part pathetic.Yokels, rednecks, hillbillies - everyone's favourite punching bag. The Grapes of Wrath doesn't look down America's uneducated, rural white folk nor presents them as a caricature but that still doesn't change the fact that none of the Joad clan are the sharpest tools in the shed nor don't understand how the outside world works. Just as we are introduced to the family the youngest daughter Rosasharn is pregnant and married when still a teen while the family is dirt poor and huge as it is.Henry Fonda's performance as Tom Joad may be the pinnacle of his acting career. His stone face alongside the laid-back manner in which he walked and talked is mesmerising yet Joad is not someone I would fancy being in the vicinity off. Fonda's performance has a sinister edge to it and a sense of barely restrained violence. His proclamation to the truck driver near the beginning of the film when telling him the reason he was in prison, a simple uttering of \"homicide\" could come straight out of a horror movie. Jane Darwell on the other hand as Ma Joad is the other great scene stealer with her hauntingly sombre, tour-de-force performance as a character with one ultimate aim - keeping the fambly together.The amazing landscape shots, use of German expressionism and high contrast lighting give way for such unforgettable images from a car light driving along the horizon to silhouettes walking across a hill, thanks to cinematographer Gregg Toland. Take the scene at the campsite in which the characters discuss their present situation; it's so dreamlike with the odd, unnatural angles, it couldn't be more mesmerising. I also recommend watching the South Park episode Over Logging which parodies this scene (and the movie as a whole), right down to the black & white cinematography.Once the Joads arrive at the Farmworkers' Wheat Patch run by the Department of Agriculture it is a temporary relief to see something good happen to the family, after all, they have been through. When The Grapes of Wrath was released in 1940, the US Secretary of Agriculture was Henry A. Wallace, whom that same year was running for Vice President with Franklin D. Roosevelt; a message of support for FDR and the New Deal no doubt? At the government camp they are greeted by a seemingly genuine, honest man who looks like FDR and tells them they have washtubs with running water; a world away from the corporate run camps the Joads took residence earlier in the film - all sounds too good to be true? The government is the solution to the Joad's problems (temporally at least as they end up leaving at a later point), nor at any point in the film do we see any charitable organisations out to help the poor. It's fairly obvious that The Grapes of Wrath doesn't exactly lean to the right of politics; evil bankers running people off their land, corrupt police, capitalists treating people like dogs, total collapse of the free market, socialist camp run by the government is only decent place to be in which cops are not allowed to lines of dialogue such as \"people are going to win rich, people are going to die\". - A world of oppressor and the oppressed if there ever existed one. Regardless of one's politics, I still contend The Grapes of Wrath to be one of the most emotionally draining films in all of cinema.",

The film follows a poor Midwestern family during the depression who are being forced off their land. After being released from jail, Tom returns home to find it abandoned. He learns that the land is no longer producing enough crops to provide for their family and the whole family heads to California to look for work. The best parts of the film are the acting, the plot, and the cinematography. The acting and casting are excellent. The entire cast is full of life and they deliver their lines with perfect execution. When Tom Joad returns home to see his family, they are all lit up and full of smiles. You are able to see the happiness and utter joy that they are feeling to be reunited with a family member and you can sense the fear and anxiety that they are feeling regarding their upcoming move.The plot is riveting. Rarely do you see a historical film that is as much of a work of art as The Grapes of Wrath is. The story will take you into the Great Depression years ago and give you a glimpse at what a poor family during that time might have gone through. The timing of the script is great and will have you hoping for the main characters to be able to keep their home some way or at least find a nicer one. The plot allows for many emotional performances.The cinematography is excellent and professional. It proves that not only the cast and actors were perfect for the jobs, but the crew must have been as well. There are no shaky shots and there are no scenes where something is out of view that should be able to be seen by the camera and there are no scenes that were too zoomed in that you couldn't see anything. The camera pans between characters based on who is talking.I would recommend this film to anybody who enjoys drama movies or anybody who is interested in history. Although this film is long (over 2 hours), there are no boring or dull parts in the film and it is definitely worth taking the time to watch it. Also, this film was made in the early 40s and it is in black and white. Even if you usually don't like or watch black and white films, I would recommend that you watch The Grapes of Wrath. This would also be an excellent film to show in history class when teaching about The Great Depression.The Grapes of Wrath is an excellent classic film that I would recommend to anyone regardless of whether or not they enjoy old films or black and white films. This film is worth the 2 hours that is takes to watch it because the acting, plot, and cinematography are phenomenal. The emotional scenes were executed to perfection and will leave you feeling sorry for the characters. The plot will have you interested in the beginning and the cinematography makes it easy to understand and see what is going on in the film. Overall this is an excellent film and deserves 10/10 stars.",

This famous movie milestone goes about the Joad family. They have to leave everything they own in Oklahoma behind. Them and several other poor families are attracted by California because there is supposed to be work and a place to live. The long trip is filled with misery and when they finally get in California, it seems that they've been deceived once more. There's almost no food and 8 hungry mouths to fill. It's impossible not to get touched by the Joad family. All the characters are so sad but at the same time so brave. They don't give up and keep fighting...you just have to encourage them while watching this film. The Grapes of Wrath really makes you feel happy you live in this era and in this part of the world. You know stories like this really happened in the old days and they still do in some parts of the world. This kind of film is excellent to make you realize you have nothing to complain about.The dramatic highlights in this motion picture are countless : The flashbacks about how families are driven away from their homes, the grandfather's \"funeral\" , the mother and son conversation near the end...

While I don't think it's director John Ford's best film (I preferred HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY, THE QUIET MAN and FORT APACHE), it is superb and well-crafted. Some of the acting (in particular Jane Darwell as \"Ma\") was terrific and very realistic, while occasionally it was a bit over the top (John Carradine as \"the Preacher\"). And the story itself was excellent and well-constructed--making an emotional and heart-felt appeal for justice and a more Socialist nation in response to the poverty of the Great Depression. You can't help but be sucked into the pitiful yet somehow hopeful lives of the Joad family. While some of the facts were definitely exaggerated in order to make this point (making it a one-dimensional fight between good and evil), the overall message of upheaval and loss was important and potent.I am a history teacher and so naturally I gravitate to films like THE GRAPES OF WRATH. It is an amazingly powerful film that is extremely touching and lovingly made--though historically, some of the film is pretty much fiction. While most web sites I checked praised the book, one presents a thoughtful and documented analysis of the actual Okie experience and compares it to the book and movie--coming up with many ways in which THE GRAPES OF WRATH isn't a totally accurate portrait of the times. Some examples cited were the general success the \"Okies\" had when they arrived in California, that the exodus to California from most of America PRE-DATED the Dust Bowl years and the Dust Bowl itself had very little actual impact on Oklahoma (though it DID affect Kansas and some other states considerably). This isn't to say that the film is completely fiction or it was a bad book or that Steinbeck was a Communist, but that Steinbeck wasn't always careful in his research and seemed to stretch facts to make his social and political statement.

            "content": "When you watch the opening credits of \"The Grapes of Wrath\" you'll see a veritable parade of legendary names in multiple areas of production: Fonda, Steinbeck, Toland, Newman, Ford. Living up to a lineup like that is a tall order but this film manages it.For those unfamiliar with Steinbeck's novel, the story concerns a family of depression era farmers who are forced off their land in Oklahoma. They resolve to travel to California in order to seek work but are continually beset with hardships as their hopes are dashed time and again. The screenplay, adapted by Nunally Johnson, was rewarded with an Oscar nomination.The cast features Henry Fonda in one of his most iconic roles, that of recently paroled Tom Joad. He instills his character with a keen sense of justice, matched with the will to fight back when driven to do so. He was nominated for an Oscar but lost out to James Stewart for his performance in \"The Philadelphia Story\". I expect that was mainly due to Stewart losing out the year before for \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\". Jane Darwell, on the other hand, saw her Oscar nomination turn into a win. As Ma Joad, she was an effective counterpoint to Fonda's character. A couple of other standouts in support were John Carradine as a disillusioned former preacher and John Qualen in a small role.In terms of technique, the film is practically flawless. John Ford's direction is impeccable and the Gregg Toland cinematography is excellent. Ford took home an Oscar for his work but, strangely, Toland wasn't even nominated. For that matter, Alfred Newman's stirring score wasn't nominated either (perhaps because it's mostly based on the song \"Red River Valley\").I haven't read the novel but I know that the storyline of the film deviates from the novel somewhat, particularly when it comes to the ending. Ultimately, though, the movie's grueling enough already; I can't imagine it ending as miserably as the novel supposedly does.I haven't seen Hitchcock's \"Rebecca\", either, so I can't say whether or not this movie deserved the Oscar for best picture, though it certainly would have been a worthy choice. Simply put, \"The Grapes of Wrath\" is an essential American film.",

            "content": "Painting a gritty yet authentic portrait of family life ravaged by economic hardships, The Grapes of Wrath covers the strenuous ordeal faced by one family as it struggles to keep itself together when everything around them is falling apart. Steered by John Ford's assured direction & powered by a couple of stellar performances, it remains one of the most memorable works of its era.Set during the Great Depression, the story of The Grapes of Wrath follows Tom Joad who's out of prison on parole, only to find out that his family has been forced off their own land. Managing to reunite with them eventually, Tom & the Joad family set off to California in search of better work, opportunities & a hopeful future but face one misfortune after another, each testing their strength.Directed by John Ford, the film doesn't even try to sugarcoat any of its events and brings back the gruesome memory of living through the Great Depression for its viewers. There's constant friction between hope & hopelessness in the script but it is deftly written & wonderfully balances the arcs of its characters. Ford's direction also makes sure that the narrative is always on point & not tread around the edges.The production design team & location setting work in tandem to recreate the era that devastated thousands of lives while further assistance comes from its smart camera-work & patient editing to help the movie achieve its desired look n feel. But what holds it together is the outstanding inputs from Henry Fonda & Jane Darwell, especially the latter who delivers a powerful performance that only gets better as story progresses.On an overall scale, The Grapes of Wrath is tragic, heartbreaking & harrowing but, despite its bleak appearance, it isn't entirely devoid of hope & optimism. We witness the Joad family disintegrating under the burdens of crashed economy yet the end result is a reflection of the strength that lies in unity and how a strongly-bonded family can steer through any situation. Expertly directed, deftly written, brilliantly performed & culminating with one of cinema's most inspiring monologues, The Grapes of Wrath comes thoroughly recommended.",

The Joads pack up everything and head west. Of course, there's the Woody Guthrie song \"If You Ain't Got the Dough Re Me.\" There really isn't an easy answer. California represents the great unknown where the streets are paved with gold and there's work and land for everyone. Naturally, the whole country was wallowing in poverty, and California was pretty well overextended. There's a point where all of us would say, 'It's either me or them.\" Henry Fonda who looks like Jane (or is it the other way around) is young Tom. He can't stand any more of the stuff his family must deal with. He is going to become enterprising. Unfortunately, he finds himself on the wrong side of the law. It's a group of socialists (some would call them dirty Commies) who come to the rescue with their collectivism setting things right. We see things through a filtered glass. John Ford had his own belief system. I felt good and clean when the Joads had some things look up for them, but I realize, also, that it's not so simple.

Many families have been driven from their homes by banks looking to reap profit despite the miserable conditions. As such the Joad family packs itself onto an aging truck and sets out towards California in hopes of finding a Golden Land. Based on a novel by the same by John Steinbeck, although I've been led to understand that the book is a lot more depressing and politically minded than this film. And if that's the case, what a depressing book it must be. Because the film isn't exactly a ray of sunshine either.And yet it is a triumph, in a sense. Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell play the leads as Tom Joad and his mother, and in them crystallize the themes of the film. All good things will end, nothing lasts forever and when hard times come, it's up to us to pick ourselves up and journey through them. Individual humans may falter, may fall, may perish, but humans as people have always survived. The film has some truly great monologues and speeches about this, and as an overall film it's all about that willingness to rise up, to bear the load, to survive. The Joads travel from one tragedy to another, and it is truly heartbreaking, but yet they endure. And that's what matters.The film also questions the basic necessities of life. When it matters, what do we need? We all need to eat, we all need to sleep. And if those basic needs are fulfilled, what then? It's natural for us to look after ourselves, including our families, perhaps our closest friends, but it takes something extra to care for anyone else. And yet, that extra caring has a meaning. Is that meaning needed, warranted or even essential? That's the question.The Grapes of Wrath shines as a rare gem. A film brilliantly acted, brilliantly told, with brilliant themes.

            "content": "Those shacks with their scrawny kids and threadbare mothers are right out of a Dorothea Lange photo essay of the Great Depression. Now, I'm no particular fan of director Ford, but he does nail this social protest film, which remains an affecting classic even 70-years later. Production notes indicate Ford had to battle TCF to get as much realism into the movie as he did. Yet, without those revealing touches, the dramatic impact would be sorely undercut.What impresses me is the similarity of conditions between then and now, that is, between the great Depression of the 1930's and the Great Recession (housing bubble) of the 2000's. Instead of a stock market collapse and a rural Dust Bowl, our era has seen a collapse of housing prices and a loss of jobs that has wiped out trillions in home-owner wealth. The collapse has created a new class of dispossessed as banks move in to repossess overdue mortgages. At the same time, the unemployed hope to find a job before government compensation runs out.In the movie, uprooted families pack up and move west to new horizons, living in tumble- down shacks along the way. Nowadays, uprooted families are either homeless or live in cars, there being scant new horizons to move to. Meanwhile, nameless bankers and Wall Streeters hover in the moneyed background, profiting off the general misery from behind gated communities. The movie goes easy on the contrast between the few rich and the many poor, but the implications remain embedded in the screenplay, especially when the sheriff evicts the sharecroppers from the land.This brief comparison is not meant to be political. Rather, it's meant to suggest that certain economic dynamics are still with us, even 70-years later, a parallel making the movie's social topic as relevant now as it was then. Of course, as yet there's no Steinbeck or Ford to dramatize the plight in the moving way of the novel or the film. But then, this new era of collapse is still pretty young.The film itself remains a triumph of casting, staging, and scripting. It's really Ma Joad's (Darwell) film, her strength and sensitivity a stand-in for migrant resilience as a whole. I'm so glad Ford refused to prettify her appearance in any fashion. Fonda too provides just the right humorless edge, that of a good man rendered an outlaw by onerous conditions of the time. Carradine's preacher may be the most interesting of the characters. Having lost \"The Call\", he's a lost soul amidst the general collapse of all that was familiar. Yet, he retains the capacities of a visionary leader, someone who can help guide the new Israelites into a land of milk and honey. It's part of the movie's tragic sense of dislocation that his new understanding is cut short. Among many memorable scenes, my favorite is the kids at the roadside diner. The hash- house waitress is a typical sassy type, used to fending off jibes from weary truckers. So, when the deal-making Pa Joad comes in with his two hungry kids, she's at first resistant. But then with the cook pushing, her resistance gives way to the humane person underneath. At the same time, the sentiment proves infectious. And instead of the diner losing money by befriending the needy Joads, the truckers leave a sizable tip. In short, a layer of everyday life is peeled back to show a seldom seen solidarity beneath.To me, not everything is roses. Ford shows his penchant for broad character humor with Grandpa Joad (Grapewin). I know Grandpa is supposed to be borderline senile; however, his overdone antics threaten to undercut the movie's concern with realistic effects. Also, the waitress's scene ending tribute to the generous truckers is unnecessary. Letting the audience grasp the humane gesture would have been more effective.Nonetheless, these are small blemishes within a beautifully wrought canvas. My lingering image is the final shot of Tom as he crosses the skyline, a silhouette of the reformist spirit now loose upon the land. My hope is there are many Tom Joads still among us.",

            "content": "John Steinbeck published \"The Grapes of Wrath\" in 1939. A well-regarded work of early 20th century social realism, the novel watches as migrant farmers struggle to survive the Great Depression. Droughts, landowners, banks, business cartels, technological changes and strikebreakers weight down upon our heroes, but they stand tall. The novel ends with Tom Joad, one farmer's saintly son, vowing to defend the oppressed and the downtrodden. As Tom embarks upon his quest, ominous flood waters threaten to drown his family and, by extension, his social class.Steinbeck's novel contains a famous sequence in which a farmer's home is demolished by a tractor hired by a bank. The angry farmer attempts to shoot the tractor's driver, but the driver insists that he is \"only following orders\". When the farmer counters that he will shoot the person who gave the orders, the driver replies that this too would be useless, as this individual is simply another bank employee. \"Well, where's the president of the bank?\" the farmer growls. The driver states that there is no president, only a board of directors who themselves receive their orders from the \"East\". \"Where does it stop?\" the farmer cries. \"Who can we shoot? I don't aim to starve to death before I can kill the man that's starving me!\" The reply: \"Maybe there's nobody to shoot. Maybe the thing isn't men at all. Maybe it's a bad thing made by men, and by God that's something we can change!\"Steinbeck's point was clear. There is no individual who is ultimately responsible for the economic forces which are harming people. Rather, all individuals are complicit in, and beholden to, a system they are themselves a product of. Such a stance would get Steinbeck labelled \"anti-American\", \"a liar\", \"communist\" and \"a Jew acting for Zionist-Marxist interests\". His book was burned in the streets, attacked in Congress and banned from schools and libraries. The fact that his first wife was a communist, and that he publicly picked fights with FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, notoriously anti-union and anti-worker, only made things worse. Over the next few decades Steinbeck would be hounded by the state, and everything he wrote would wind up in a FBI document. It would later be revealed that he was put under government surveillance as early as 1935. Fearing attempts on his life, Steinbeck would buy himself a gun for self-defence.John Ford directed \"The Grapes of Wrath\" in 1940. The film is regarded as a classic, was showered with awards, but Ford ultimately disliked the picture. The film's leftist slant rubbed against Ford's political conservatism, and the meddling hands of producer Darryl Zanuck oft irked the director. Zanuck is himself responsible for the film's hokey ending, which was installed without Ford's consent.Ford's grievances aside, \"Wrath\" remains one the director's finest pictures. Like Steinbeck's novel, it watches as a family of Oklahoman farmers are torn from their land. Seeking employment, and respite from drought and sandstorms, they venture toward the state of California, the new Promised Land. Unfortunately their journey points only to broken promises and shattered dreams, an entire nation's notions of \"manifest destiny\" mocked along the way.Ford has a number of exceptionally photographed pictures (\"My Darling Clementine\" and \"Drums Along the Mohawk\" especially). Aesthetically, \"Grapes of Wrath\" is every bit their equal. Poised between myth and social realism, the film boasts fine cinematography by Greg Toland, which is abstract in places, expressive, poetic, even ghostly. Unfortunately, like most realist and neo-realist works, which sanctify the poor, the film's photographic depiction of poverty is highly sentimentalised: a continuation of very specific type of Victorian-era aestheticization.Like most John Ford films, \"Wrath\" features endless waggon trails, armies of travellers \"heading west\", bands of folksy old-timers, expansive vistas and puts a wonderful emphasis on \"community\". Unlike most Ford films, however, \"Wrath\" re-contextualises Ford's usual tropes and embeds them within a plot which counters the conservatism (and stands against the class-bias and implicit racism) of some of his more popular films. Ford would continue this trend with his next picture, \"Tobacco Road\".\"In the souls of the people, the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy,\" Steinbeck would write. The line, ominous, hinted not only at violent revolt, but the ushering in of a better society. This call for socialist solidarity is erased in Ford's film, which engages in subtle forms of depoliticization and which for the most part avoids Steinbeck's critiques of state, private property etc in favour for populist boss-bashing. Leading the charge is actor Henry Fonda, who plays Tom Joad. Like his role in Ford's \"Lincoln\" some years earlier, Tom's part folk hero, part Jesus Christ, a homespun redresser of social wrongs.Ford and Zanuck dilute Steinbeck's novels in other ways. \"The old methods of intimidation and starvation perfected against the foreign peons are now being used against the white workers,\" Steinbeck would write, the author aware of America's long history of exploitation. Indeed, the refugees from the dust bowl accounted for only six percent of the southwestern migrants to California. Most were Mexican and Filipino workers, but this doesn't fit Ford's view of quintessentially white, rugged, American pioneers. The film is also wary of pointing fingers at the state (the land retirement policies of the US government \u2013 like the notorious Agricultural Adjustment Act, which was designed to artificially inflate the cost of crops \u2013 were instrumental in displacing farmers and landowners) and ignores the confluence of forces (The Depression, the collapse of the tenant system, the rise of mega-agribusinesses, mechanised farming etc) which were pushing people into poverty. Expecting such nuance from one of the most mainstream directors and producers of the era is silly, but it nevertheless partially explains why Ford and Zanuck received comparatively little resistance when assembling their film.8.9/10 \u2013 Masterpiece. See \"Wendy and Lucy\", \"The Wild River\", \"Bound for Glory\", \"Bread and Roses\" and \"Land of Plenty\".",

The grief and agony that the characters in this film undergo is quite unlike anything you will ever see again, and the most difficult part to accept is that it's all true. Set in the time period when America was still mired in the depression, the government has been forcing people off of their land in the american heartland and bulldozing their houses with caterpillar tractors. The evicted family the film focuses on is then forced to move to california, which promises to provide them with happiness and prosperity as best it could. When they arrive though, they are met with something arguably even worse than what they just ran from, and the family is forced into a migrant camp, where they encounter other people that are starving, tired, and barely alive. Through superb acting and writing, the perils faced by Henry Fonda drive his actions as he tries to lead himself and his relatives out of this nightmare. By the time this movie came out, it was 1940, the depression was over, and the economy was booming again, but we must never forget those extremely difficult times when people were forced to live in uninviting locales like those depicted here, and work themselves to death just to buy food. In an era where the depression was still fresh in everybody's mind, and people were actively trying to forget about the pain it caused, The Grapes of Wrath revisits it in all its grim detail, not to agitate those who lived through it, but to pay homage to their efforts and how they survived.",

Its somewhat easy to pocket his presence when in the company of a great director. Its why you need to see something like this where his influence is so obvious it is hard to ignore.Ford isn't a BAD director, so much. He's actually something of a genius in taking life and simplifying it into one or two tosses of simple objects, then framing those simplifications in an effective way. His films work, pure and simple. But that's what they are, pure without challenging ambiguities. And simple in the sense that so-called conservatives politicians mime.Once you escape the pull of those simplified values you see that his films are a huge waste, fake values manufactured only to support a story strategy; values that have since taken on their own selfish lives.And here. The story is vapid. The acting trite (excluding Carradine) and offensively staged. Its actually demeaning as if these people suffered not in vain because they can \"teach\" us something. Suffering is suffering, not lessons. But you won't see the frustrating reduced, artificial here, even with all the obsolete stagecraft. Its because Toland has rendered this so with such remarkable richness that the art of photography overcomes the thing. He captures nuance that Ford cannot see. His documentation surpasses the fact that it is film extras and constructed sets in front of the lens; the lens sees beyond that and gives us genuine pathos, disconnect. Its never in the parts manipulated by Ford in the foreground, but the background elements, the world in which our little play is staged.There's something about the quality of the film that I think we will never see again. Even the Coens, when trying to reproduce the textures in \"Man Who Wasn't There\" Had to shoot it in color and print it in black and white. In a few years, it will all be digital. It may even look like this sometimes. But what was happening then, in Kane, here, was that there were chemical memories being formed in catalyzed emulsions in a device, while a master of that device had similar chemical processes working in his brain, and he was able to coordinate the two.

            "content": "John Steinbeck's \"The Grapes of Wrath\" undoubtedly ranks among the greatest works of American realist literature. It stands as a testament of the Great Depression era where tenant farmers of the dust bowls suffer under drought, then are brutally dispossessed and driven from their Oklahoma homes, forced to find their luck elsewhere. In the end all they have is themselves, as the trip to find the blessed land California demands a heavy toll, is accompanied by tragedies and setbacks and the outlook is bleak in the face of the greed that exploits honest workers to make a buck. John Ford tries the impossible - to go for an authentic rendition of the multilayered, detail packed, all around magnificently written Steinbeck material, and definitely succeeds in delivering an indispensable heart-wrenching film portraying the never ending struggle of the Joads. Any direct comparison between book and film however is moot, enjoy both for what they are. On board in this road movie of the existential kind are Henry Fonda as an ex-convict, John Carradine as a disillusioned preacher and the Oscar winning Jane Darwell as Ma Joad, all first-rate acting with strong support of an array of bit players who help the crude reality take shape. Highly recommendable! There are downsides, though. For one the two hours of screen time can barely correspond to the epic proportions of the novel. However, the entry is still much more complete than Kazan's adaption of Steinbeck's other epic drama \"East of Eden\", starring Jimmy Dean, which only shows a fraction of the story. The one real liability however is the diluted ending which was tucked on as a concession to the mass audience while Steinbeck's epic hits you with full force. Well, if you want the real thing, read the book. With the film you get a pretty good taste of it.",

            "content": "The \"Grapes of Wrath\" film is a somewhat simplified version of Steinbeck's Pulitzer Prize winning book about an Oklahoma tenant farmer family in the Dust Bowl days. After being evicted from the land they'd farmed for generations, they join many other Okie families migrating to California seeking opportunities to work. In California the Okies were often taken advantage of by affluent land owners who promised fair wages but then paid half what they promised. Those migrants who resisted exploitation were sometimes viewed (and treated) as \"reds\"; local police (or private security agents) were too often used to intimidate or quell resistance. Steinbeck's criticism of such exploitation of workers led to banning the book in some places although it became quite popular through most of the US and led to reforms. Henry Fonda's role as Tom Joad earned his stardom; Jane Darwell (as Ma Joad) won a deserved Oscar for best supporting actress as did John Ford for directing.Steinbeck was very critical of an economic system that allowed such mistreatment of sharecroppers and tenant farmers by wealthy land owners, bankers, etc., (supported by local officials wherever the owners/bankers resided). But while the movie piles worst case on worst case, IMO it's a fair view of how bad things sometimes got in the Great Depression era (1929-40). I spent 2 summers (1949, 1950) in the Bootheel of Missouri working in communities of former sharecroppers who'd been evicted from their jobs and their shack homes in circumstances parallel to that of the Okie families. These evictions happened when the owners of the cotton plantations, after receiving federal agricultural subsidies for NOT growing cotton, decided to keep all the money for themselves by evicting their farm families (January, 1939), making thousands homeless.The tenant farmer/sharecropper system was based on the land owners providing substandard housing to farm families plus advancing them credit (in their company stores) for food, clothing, and seed. In return the farm families planted, tilled, and picked the cotton. But their share of return from the cotton harvest was never sufficient to get out of debt to the store. The system made the farm families, in essence, indentured servants. Until they were kicked out.While the motivations (land owners' greed, farm families' struggles to survive in extreme circumstances) and conflicts were very similar to what the Okies experienced, the resolution of this Bootheel crisis became far more uplifting and inspiring than the struggles without victors presented in the \"Grapes of Wrath.\" But almost certainly, the popularity of this book and movie helped lead to such a different outcome in the Bootheel only a few years later.This video describes the Bootheel situation: http://www1.teachertube.com/viewVideo.php?video_id=148227By Googling \"Sharecroppers Strike\" and \"Cotton Patch Moses\" you'll find a number of links that describe this Bootheel crisis, its conflicts, significant people, and outcomes.",

At no point did I care whether the Joads made it to California; the deaths of the old folks made no impression on me. The villainy of the local cops and those who ran the work camps was much mitigated by its obvious artifice. The only emotion any of these people inspired in me was a deep desire to punch that self-righteous jerk Tom Joad right in the mouth--which I don't think was what Ford was going for. I have to admit that I did like John Carradine, but I always like John Carradine.And when the Joads drove into that federal government work camp, and it was like arriving in heaven with an obvious FDR lookalike (sans wheelchair, of course) as God, I completely lost it.

Joad and his family head to California to start a new life, but this journey proves to have more hazards and pitfalls than they could ever have anticipated.The Grapes Of Wrath is a film adaptation based on the John Steinbeck novel. I'll start by saying that I haven't read the book, but I can safely say that the 'cinematic' version of the book fell well below my expectations....For starters the film takes an immensely long time to get going (one could actually argue as to whether it ever gets going). The problem is that the first half is awfully slow and dull with very little happening to drive the narrative forward. To me, The Grapes Of The Wrath came across as a character-driven film but when the film is filled with uninteresting and poorly developed characters it became very hard for me to remain interested or give a damn about anything that happens to them on their journey to California.The second half of the film is slightly better (in the sense that it has a bit more urgency about it). Although the better pacing made the second half more tolerable than the first half I still felt that the whole film had a superficial feel to it - we get to see glimpses of the suffering and pain that has been bestowed upon the family, but it's never really examined in much depth and this resulted in a film that just never seemed to take advantage of all of its potential.The cast are all OK and whilst Fonda wasn't particularly brilliant here I appreciated that he tried to give the film some emotional weight (which again probably would have worked better if both the narrative and character dynamics had been stronger and more interesting).So yes I didn't like this film but will say that this was more down to the slow-paced first half, poor characterisation and the missed potential in fleshing the story out and making it more interesting.",

What truly lies at the center of this classic American film is not a socialistic message but rather a universal message; one that says that all people suffer in one way or another and it is the defiance and resistance that separates us from anyone else and our ability to choose not to take this lying down.The story is well-known: the Joad family is forced off their Oklahoma farm along with thousands of other Dust Bowl victims and decide to move to California in search of jobs and wages. Along the way they encounter kindness, hatred, peace and anger. There are times when the tribulations they face in California are more difficult than trying to survive in the Midwest, but push on they do led by the recently-paroled Tom, played quietly and most effectively by the great Henry Fonda. Jane Darwell won an Oscar for her role as the mother who also does her best to try and keep the fit together despite serious situations that could force them apart. Every other role is well-cast and adds a rich realistic tone to this movie that only makes you feel even more for these people who are just trying to get by each day, hoping for some sort of break or providence as a sign.I can see how this was such a politically-charged story but I don't think Ford intended that to be the priority of the film. Rather, I think it can all be summed up in the words of the two gas attendants early in the film. One says he thinks Okies have no feelings because no human would live like they do. Really, he was complimenting them as they believed the same way and this whole movie is about them attempting to rise above that which they were previously part of and become part of something better or at least more substantial. All this because they're the people.",

            "content": "This tragic tale of the Joad family and their struggles living in the dust bowl during the depression is one of the great literary novels of all time. The movie version has propelled the story to legendary status and is considered one of the greatest movies of all time, sometimes even appearing in the top 10 lists of various film critics and classic movie fans. John Stenbeck's novel also became a great play in the 1990's, one of the few times in the American theater where something already so familiar to audiences could strike a cord and remain as fresh as it had been when it was first written and filmed.The tragic figure of Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) is a quiet man who has been beaten by life, and there is no getting back up for him. Already having been put in prison for murder, he knows there's no way out for the second time, an accidental killing during a riot involving unsympathetic work camp guards and striking workers. All through his journey is his devoted and loving mother, Ma Joad (Jane Darwell), who provides the voice of reason, still not quite beaten even though she definitely has the weight of the world on her shoulders through the tragedies her family has seen.If there was ever a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, that is the tragedy of Tom Joad's life. It seems that the fickle finger of fate is constantly pointing at him, making him doomed to suffer at the hands of chance. There's a big heart tucked away inside a soul that longs for release, and he quietly deals with every unfortunate incident of his life with grace and dignity. It is as if his life is one big shrug of the shoulder. There is no bitterness, only acceptance of the fact that this is the way his life is destined. Yet, he doesn't want to see anybody else taken down with him, particularly an embittered former preacher (John Carradine) and a sad little pipsqueak of a man (John Qualen) whom he encounters along the way.Then, there's his family, sticking together through thick and thin and never any personal judgments, especially against ex-con Fonda. Grandpa Charley Grapewin (\"The Wizard of Oz\", \"Tobacco Road\") jumps up and down with excitement like a little kid, but the same fickle finger of fate that points at Fonda has turned into a visit by death for poor Grandpa. There are no tears in the Joad family, no maudlin cries of \"Why?\", just the realization that they represent the people, always stepped on by those in authority, but some day, those meek people will inherit the earth. Two soliloquies, one by Fonda, another by Darwell, are the glue which holds this together, expressing the depths of their souls and their totally unselfish natures which only long to survive somehow, as long as they are together.The film has no real conclusion, which represents life which doesn't always have a connecting beginning, middle or end. That's the power of Stenbeck's tale, superbly directed by the amazing John Ford. Every character is there for a purpose, giving some minor players great opportunities to shine. Zeffie Tilbury, the elderly character actress who played bits in some big films and supporting roles in some \"B's\" (and is best known for the feisty old lady whom Spanky, Alfalfa and the rest of \"Our Gang\" encounters in \"Second Childhood\") is moving as Grandma, sitting there quietly and accepting her fate, only briefly mourning her husband.Darwell, who deservedly won an Oscar, is actually a leading lady in this film, but in 1940 Hollywood, if you were portly and middle aged, you were deemed as a character actress, and character actresses (unless you were Marie Dressler) were supporting. Fonda lost his much deserved Oscar to old friend James Stewart who won pretty much because he had lost the previous year for a film he had deserved to win for. Such are the Grapes of Wrath, whether they are the bitter grapes of man's inhumanity to man or the honoring of the most honest performance of an actor's career that has nothing to do with ego but everything to do with brilliance.",

            "content": "Often cited as a prime example of 'The Great American Novel', John Stienbeck's \"The Grapes of Wrath\" was hailed more for tackling unpalatable political truths at a time when the nation as a whole would rather have buried its head in the sand, than for its literary merits, though they are many. In filming the book in 1940 producer Darryl F Zanuck and director John Ford pulled no punches; even seventy years on this extraordinary film still has the power to shock as American moves ever closer to the possibility of recession: it is just as relevant today as it ever was.It's about the Great Depression, essentially about the Oakies forced off their land, initially by nature itself, thereafter by the banks which took over their share-holdings, and about their migration to California. It's a bleak, harrowing film with no real happy ending. Speeches by Tom Joad and his mother about 'how he'll be there when ever there is a fight so hungry people can eat' or about how 'they can't lick us 'cause we're the people' may have the whiff of optimism but 'not licking us' isn't quite the same as putting bread on the table. Consequently, the film's success has largely been critical and while Ford and Jane Darwell won Oscars the film itself was overlooked in favour of \"Rebecca\", (an oversight rectified the following year when Ford's far inferior \"How Green Was My Valley\" won Best Picture).In the hands of a lesser director it is unlikely the film would have been quite so grim. It's certainly not flawless; there is a penchant for Fordian sentimentality and the characters of Grandpa and Grandma never rise above caricature, but it's still remarkably faithful to Stienbeck's original and thanks, in the main, to Gregg Toland's superb black and white cinematography a good deal of it has the look of a documentary.It is also very well acted. John Qualen's Muley is a beautifully etched study in despair and John Carradine has one of his best roles as 'The Preacher' who finds himself in the unlikely role of a union leader. At the centre, of course, are two great performances. Henry Fonda brings his gangly, liberal integrity to the part of Tom Joad which fits him like a glove while Darwell's stoic, Mother Courge of a Ma Joad rises above the sentimentality and the penchant for caricature into the realms of the truly tragic.",

Even if you don't like the social politics, which people in 1940 often did not (the government was helping the poor too generously and so forth), you have to love the movie. Henry Fonda is only the beginning of a series of tough, beautiful performances. And the series of heartbreaks is balanced by glimmers of hope.Most of all, oddly, is that this is a cinematic masterpiece, tightly constructed, and seen (and photographed) with aesthetic intelligence. Maybe the most amazing performance is Ma Joad (Jane Darwell), who commands the role of an earthy, wise, smart woman fighting the disintegration of her family. She's quite astonishing.Toland's photography is worth noting not only for the usual framing of the shots or the occasional moving camera (when it moves through the squatter camp, slowly, showing the parade of poor people, it's quite striking), but for his use of minimal light. This isn't some film noir effect, but a way of capturing the candlelight, firelight, and just dim night skies that were very real, and very effective here. Great stuff.Dorothea Lange, the FSA photographer who set the framework for the visuals in this movie, is of a special order of photographer, visual but highly human and emotional. And empathetic. Ford and Toland manage to make this into a non stop moving experience, over two hours, and it's no small feat. The fact these are all actors, and yet they are so convincing, adds just another level of appreciation. Yes, great stuff.",

And then there's the acting. Henry Fonda was, no doubt, one of the greatest actors of all times, and this might just be his best film (other great roles of his include The Lady Eve, made the following year, and Hitchcock's underrated The Wrong Man). John Carradine has his shining hour here - too often he was cast in B-movies. Even in Stagecoach, his role was kind of, well, cheesy (I'm not a big fan of that particular Ford film). That scene where Tom Joad meets him in the tent is excellent; Carradine is brilliant (and so is Greg Tolland; man, look at the lighting job!). I do, however, wish he had kept his mustache. It's hard to picture him without it! But even with those two masterful actors, a viewer's attention will always shift to Jane Darwell, who plays the Joad matriarch. She won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, perhaps the most justly won Oscar in the Academy's history. There is a scene near the beginning of the film in which, as the Joad family is just about to flee their home, Mrs. Joad finds some old earrings. She puts them up to her earlobes and looks in the mirror. How long has it been since she was young or beautiful enough to wear earrings? The past is past, and it will never come back.",

            "content": "Based on John Steinbeck's Pulitzer prize winning novel of the same name, about the mid-west proletariat struggle during the great depression of the 1930's, John Ford's adaptation to film is a sweeping and emotional drama, displaying the problems entailed when a family are forced to move west in the search for work. Tom Joad (Henry Fonda), is travelling back to his homestead after five years in prison for manslaughter. On arriving back he discovers that his family have been evicted from the family farm due to a corporate take overs, and banks foreclosing on the land. So the only option is to travel to California, as they had been presented with a flier advertising picking work.We follow the family through series hardship across the breadth of the USA. Deaths occur, and the working part of the family are mistreated and abused by ruthless business's, who have seized the opportunity to take advantage of the mass exodus of farm workers, making the \"pilgrimage\" from east to west. The film is an indictment of the times. Many families would have had to make this journey, mainly due to the greed of financial institutions (sound familiar?).The film is majestically shot in beautiful black and white. The fact that it was filmed in studios does not seem to make the journey any less real. The film ends with Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) making a statement for the entire proletariat population: \"We'll go on forever, cause we are the people\". A bold statement, that could be used today. The working classes will always be here, and will always be needed. The people are the most important functioning body in the world. What the film shows historically, socially and politically, is that all moments of history (that is each moment there is failure or change) are in a perpetually cyclical motion - therefore, history perpetually repeats itself.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

            "content": "This remarkable movie is among the best ever done for emotional content and in spite of its old age, it confirms me 3 facts:1) I have always heard John ford about open fields, distant horizons and that's true here: the unlikely journey of the family offers us stunning visuals about the wild, dangerous and yet beautiful american landscape and yes, it's maybe even more gripping in black and white!2) This old movie is an eye opener about exploitation of men by men and it's much more essential than the today cries about skin, gender, sex or arms. The last prejudices are just like toys for babies, bones for dogs, something easy and inoffensive to focus the attention while the main, big attack is left untouched and unchallenged! In a way, those old american movies were thus more intelligent, assertive and free back then than today because i can't name a single recent movie about the poor, the exploited and the left-over of the American Dream while crisis and inequalities have never been so strong!3) This old movie is like Missisipi Burning a precious proof for the case prosecuting America! So this country genocides natives, crushed workers rights, corrupts its politicians, makes war all over the globe, practiced slavery and segragation but ends up considered like the worldwide light of freedoom! Just unbelievable (and excellent propaganda)! Here the case is clear: money is the only value, reference to deal with people life, law is made for the rich and powerful and that's all! Thus destroying farms is lawful, mourning relatives and memories is a waste of time... In the same period, Soviets were into collective farming and they are the only bad guys! Honestly, in America, lands is owned by a few tycoons so i don't see a fundamental difference. In Germany, labor camps were built and those that we watched in sunny free California seems to be like them: workers behind barb wire, in barracks with the minimum of comfort and exploited to their death!And for sure, Ma Joad is an exceptional angel, a unforgettable ray of light in this world of terrible darkness: a must see if you have human feelings: Her scene when the family packs, not for a trave but because they are expelled from the land they built is one of the biggest moment in cinema: They must get rid of everything worthless and picks only the vital things. In other words, they are compelled to judge their own life and to forget a lot of happier time. So Ma Joad throws in fire all her family pics!

            "content": "This is a social conscience picture form the genres heyday. Although never described as such, the dust bowl was an American refugee crisis. Wrath follows some of the affected characters who are so poor they probably owe rent on their own skin. From the very first frame Gregg Tolands photography is amazing, whether it's simply a static composition or whether the camera is in motion.John Ford, as Orson Welles has said, was an artist, but he's not particularly known for getting anything more than serviceable performances out of his corral. And usually any of the finer points of a performances are held a beat too long, or are notched up well past what is necessary, as are movies of the period.But the real crime here is that the film's \"nobility of the common man\" pap is piled upon itself so high that a viewer begins to suffocate. A little of that goes a very, very very long way. I was shouting at my TV - \"Oh please, will you move on. We got your thesis! Everyone GETS IT!\" He also does this in They were Expendable. He does it in \"How Green was my Valley.\" He doesn't do it in \"The Quiet Man,\" which is a movie I like. In this world poverty is the signifier of moral righteousness. Grampa Joad gumming his way through addled, irritating, overacted speeches, and Pa Joad going for a bath with his junk flapping around are thrills I'd prefer to miss.As is the tradition in Amercan films, if a man over 70 gets in a car for a long trip he ain't going to make it. As was his style, Max Steiner selects a musical motif and beats you to a pulp with it. Here it's Red River Valley. The crew ends up at a Utopian work camp as unreal as the epilogue in Raising Arizona. But the conflict is still pretty accurate about how conservative reactionaries generate phony causes to dismantle any peaceful, progressive threat to their viability. And it only hints at what complete thugs conservatives will become.",

            "content": "\"The Grapes of Wrath\" is an inspired, harsh and critical retake on the Great Depression and its human fall out. While other studios were producing ultra high glamor and star driven vehicles, Darryl F. Zanuck chose to turn his spotlight on the crisis of the country and came up with an all time box office winner. It stars Henry Fonda as the forgotten man of conscience who is forced to leave his homestead in search of a hopefully better life that, sadly, is not to be. Jane Darwell is brilliant as Ma Joad, the defiant, resilient and compelling matriarch who keeps the family together through these tough times. Dark was the world of the 1930s in reality, but never was it more magically brought to life than in this inspirational film of hope, courage and the dream of prosperity that must have seemed so far out of reach at the time of the film's general release.TRANSFER: Previous versions of this film have looked as though they were caught in their own dust bowl. This DVD managed to recapture much of the lost visual style absent in earlier versions. Greg Tolland's evocative camera work is magnificently captured. Black levels are deep. The gray scale, for the most part is well balanced and captures the stark harshness of the original presentation. There are a host of age related artifacts present throughout but these have at least been tempered and do not terribly distract. There is some shimmering of fine details and more than a hint of pixelization in this transfer. Nevertheless, the image quality is an improvement over previous incarnations. Somehow it almost seems to add to the vintage of subject matter of this film. The audio is remixed to 5.1 but really \u0096 this is a mono film with very little spread or reason for it across your other channels.BOTTOM LINE: \"The Grapes of Wrath\" is an enduring tale of enduring souls caught in the uncertainty of their times. But there's no uncertainty about my recommendation of this disc. An absolute must!",

            "review_title": "one of the most unsentimental films of the 'Golden Age' of Hollywood, possibly Ford's best",
            "content": "For a motion-picture made in 1940, this one gets the depression probably more on-target than I have seen in any American work (Bound for Glory might be a short bit behind). This is due to two factors, one a little more obvious than the other. Steinbeck's book (still, sadly, unread by me, though other works like the Pearl are amazing on their own) is called the definitive account of the poverty-stricken mid-American experience in the depression, and it probably is. It allows for a very literary sensibility to form about such an American family like the Joads, who are the kind of folk that you'd think, if there wasn't immediate cynicism to be had with the like, politicians would be addressing first and foremost in speeches as the 'working man' and 'American family'. Sadly ironic then that the film had controversy for depicting some of California as corrupt, and that years later there would be charges on John Ford and Steinbeck of being un-American/communist for their respective work. Steibeck knew what he was doing, that's the short of it.The second part is that Ford and David O. Selznick had such faith and dedication to the material in making it so straightforward that none of the possible melodramatic fat would be noticeable. This is so pure a work of American familial drama that any sense of sentimentality seems to be stripped away (as opposed to sentiment, there is a difference, as also noted by Scorsese re: Paths of Glory). Considering the cast, such as stars Henry Fonda and John Carradine- plus the quietly scene-stealing performance of Jane Darwell- it almost has the feel here and there of (pre) neo-realism, at least as far as Hollywood could take it. There's such a matter-of-factness to the turns that are taken with the Joads on their journey across the southwest to California- the bulldozers, Tom coming home after killing a man, the deaths of grandpa and grandma (the latter just in time to see California), and the subsequent trials and tribulations of working on near slave wages, that it builds the drama unexpectedly. You want the Joads to keep on going because they've earned the emotional investment honestly.Only towards the very end, perhaps, does a tinge of the alleged communist &/or socialist stuff leak in, but it's not without some reason. By the time Tom Joad (Fonda) has gone through what's happened, his eyes have grown more empathetic than ever for those around him. His final speech, however full of the low-key gusto that calls out for attention, is effective because of what it means for the character, not even so much for the society at large. What's preceded this spirit for the working man has been very simple, the kind of style that many fans of the movies love Ford's work. It's a road movie essentially, and the story keeps on moving along to point after point that hits home what the Joads, and for that matter other families who've ventured out to California, have to deal with. And while there are some scenes where Ford and his DP Greg Toland move the story along in some stylistic flourishes (i.e. the montage of signs and roads, and the bulldozers in the flashback), the script doesn't allot for any time to take any more breathing room than necessary.And as far as an adaptation- even without reading the book- it's quite wonderful, particularly where one can see that a scene or a moment that probably had profundity in the wording is given an equal amount of emotional weight by what isn't said (the example I'd give is before the Joads leave Oklahoma, the night before, as Ma is in the house by herself, the somber accordion music in the background, as she looks at old pieces of memories and throwing them bit by bit into the fire- all around it's a masterful scene). And on top of there being a sense of truth in the source to screen (with, of course, the necessary cuts and omissions for 1940 production code standards), the performances are golden. Fonda was rarely better, exemplifying all that was good naturally to him as a persona into his character (this and 12 Angry Men his quintessential socially conscious 'Average-joe' performances); Darwell, as mentioned, takes up the screen in her role of a career; Carradine skates between being truly dramatic and campy, and comes off as, simply, intense.It's a gripping saga, and it may even surprise those who are expecting it to be an 'old-fashioned' tale of dust-bowl suffering during the depression. It is actually old-fashioned, in the most honorable way a picture from the period can be. A++",

            "review_title": "Misrepresentation Of History",
            "content": "This hyped classic has a number of problems seldom acknowledged by reviewers and serious film historians. Only the first 45 minutes or so take place in Oklahoma. Well over half the plot is set either on the road or in California. This is a curious plot structure for a film about \"okies\".Very few of the Oklahoma scenes were actually filmed in Oklahoma. Indeed, the Joad farmstead and surrounding landscape look nothing at all like Oklahoma; these scenes were all filmed in California. In point of fact, John Steinbeck was born and raised in California. His novel is based on second-hand information, distorted even more by a Hollywood cinema machine interested only in money.Viewers have come to assume, implicitly, that Steinbeck's book is factual. It is not. The story is fiction. The Joad clan is fictional. Their journey to California is fictional. The specific worker camps are fictional. The only elements of the film that are based on truth are the era setting and the struggles that most people from the Great Plains endured during the 1930s. That part is real.There was genuine hardship and suffering. But it's a mistake to assume that everyone who migrated to California during that period were as destitute as the Joads. I personally have ancestors who lived in Oklahoma in that era; some moved; some stayed in Oklahoma, but none were indigent. The Joad's decrepit car is a symbol of the film's visual misrepresentation, in addition to the fake Oklahoma landscape.The exaggerated impoverishment of script characters results from a Hollywood establishment eager to send a political message about social class inequity, a way to manipulate viewer perceptions. But the downside to that manipulation is that it has had a profoundly negative effect on Oklahoma and other Great Plains states in the subsequent sixty years. The resulting cultural bias against these dust bowl states has caused damage that far surpasses the damage done by nature and the economy. Such is the power of Hollywood and the gullibility of viewers to trust filmmakers.That said, the film's B&W cinematography is quite good. The story is rendered mournfully bleak, largely as a result of Gregg Toland's use of wide-angle lenses and dim lighting. The song \"Red River Valley\" is ideal for the locale and era. I also like the absence of actors' makeup, which adds a subtle touch of realism. Casting is acceptable and so is acting, except for the two most elderly of the Joads (Grandpa and Grandma), who overact dreadfully. Their portrayal of old people is insulting.I consider \"The Grapes Of Wrath\" a Hollywood sacred cow, critically untouchable. But Steinbeck and Hollywood combined to do far more damage to the dust bowl states than the hardships that actually occurred. The cultural residue this film has left has been most unfortunate.",

John Ford is the man who does it and who else it could have been. He brought possibly the most inspirational film for people in the beginning of 40s decade. Next year he also brought another people's film 'How Green Was My Valley\" and these 2 films changed some people's lives forever. When you make a film from experiences of people gone through tough times it becomes mandatory to end the film on high note and if it's inspirational then there's no stopping. The Grapes of Wrath is just not a film, it is something more than that. I can imagine how people would have reacted to the film in 1940 if i am reacting so enthusiastically in 2020. A story of poor family who have been thrown out of thier own land and how they battle out all the difficulties will surely leave you with an heart wrenching experience. In a feature film aspects, The Grapes of Wrath is work of a genius, truly. There are some brilliant scenes in the film that will force to you take a note that this kind of genius filmmaking was done in 1940 and anyhow you have to believe it. Acting of the long studded cast is fantastic but Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell are too good. The writing seems fantastic even after excluding few scenes from the novel. Dear John Ford why you so awesome? How did you manage to pull out an inspiring tale in early 40s like never before? That last speech of Tom Joad while leaving the family and Ma Joad's Inspirational words in the last scene will always stay with me. \"I'll be around the dark, I'll be everywhere\" and \"We're the people that live. They can't wipe us out\". Inhale with pride and i am done here.RATING- 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "content": "John Ford's \"The Grapes of Wrath\" stands tall in the history of cinema. Many critics would say it is the greatest Hollywood film ever made, even better than Orson Welles' \"Citizen Kane.\" Whatever stance the viewer takes, it is a must-see movie. A few scenes in this masterpiece were actually shot on location around Sallisaw, Oklahoma. Though many from Oklahoma were offended by parts of the book and film, especially calling the Joads \"Okies,\" others realized what Ford and the author of the book, John Steinbeck, were presenting. The Joads are depicted as honest, hardworking salt of the earth Americans knocked down by Old Man Depression and the Dust Bowl, not as ignorant hillbillies as some believe. The so-called respectable agricultural conglomerate heads and big businessmen are the ones shown as malevolent heartless persons, with the law, especially hand-picked deputy sheriffs, being represented as brutes and murderers. Sallisaw today honors the movie and the book by having a Grapes of Wrath Festival each year.Henry Fonda in a role of a lifetime--and he knew it--turns in his best performance. In one of the great film portrayals of all time, Tom Joad, Fonda is able to capture the essence of this set upon human being who is trying to survive in a world he never made. Pulled apart by society's pliers, Tom speaks for the common people with heart and soul. The viewer knows that this young man with somewhat of a chip on his shoulder who is easy to rile, often responding by violence, is destined to return to the prison from which he was paroled, McAlester, or one just like it. He is admired because he will never surrender, never back down, fighting to end injustice and exploitation of the working man. Amazingly Fonda did not become type cast as a result of playing Tom Joad and went on to play many diversified roles and start a cinema dynasty with controversial Jane Fonda almost equaling her father in acting ability.Though Tom is the main character in both the book and the film, he is not the hero. That title belongs to the indomitable Ma Joad, who is determined to keep her family together come Hell or high water. She too won't back down but she is also filled with Christian love and charity for all God's creatures, even the despicable and cruel. Jane Darwell deservedly won the Academy Award for best supporting actress for her brilliant performance as Ma. Her final dialog in the battered old truck heading for Fresno says it all. The rest of the cast, consisting of John Ford's regular troupe of actors such as Ward Bond, is fine tuned to the nth degree. John Carradine's key role as Preacher Casy is exceptional as is John Qualen's graveyard ghost Muley Graves.Director John Ford, who also copped an Oscar, with his cinematographer Gregg Toland captures on film the face of hunger by visualizing what it is like to be dispossessed of one's heritage. The most telling image is that of the Joads standing up to unbridled greed when the cats are pushing over their homes. The camera pans away from their defiant figures, a dusty wind whistling through their hair, to focus on their shadows. The wind-blown shadows are all that is left of their previous lives. Their homes gone. Their families torn apart and scattered. All their worldly possessions abandoned. Now they must look westward to California for what they pray is a new beginning.Modern viewers find it difficult to understand how \"The Grapes of Wrath\" was considered so controversial that John Ford and his crew had to shoot it in a surreptitious manner. John Steinbeck's socialistic message was watered down somewhat for the movie, but it does peek through every now and then. Tom wants to know, \"Who are these Reds?\" In those days being associated in any way with the labor movement could get you branded a Communist, even if you did not know what a Communist was. The ending was also changed to make it more upbeat and optimistic. The music is sufficient to convey the feelings and emotions of the Oklahoma refugees, especially the main theme \"Red River Valley.\" One of the high points in the film is when Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) sings the song to his mother when all are finally having fun once more at the big dance in a New Deal migrant workers camp. Yet had John Ford the foresight to utilize the talents of Oklahoma native Woody Guthrie for the songs the musical score would have been a masterpiece. Woody did write his own score inspired by watching the film. His \"Dust Bowl Ballads\" are among the artistic triumphs of the 20th century.",

Through the absorbing realistically-handled journey of the Joad Family, sharecroppers from Oklahoma, the movie is a tacit homage to all the farmers who were kicked out of their own land after half a century, and by an enemy even more redoubtable because he was invisible. Call it corporations, banks, politics, it's impossible to point a finger on a responsible person, let alone a gun, all the 'Okies' are left with is a bitter resignation mixed with the hopes for brighter futures in California, the promised land.Through its documentary value, \"The Grapes of Wrath\" works as the perfect contradiction to all the supporters of Capitalism as the core of American ideals. It's a film about the little people, those who had faith and lost it. The central character is Tom Joad, an ex-convict, released after four years. Joad was imprisoned for homicide but doesn't carry any regret, the 'victim' had it coming: he pulled a knife. Joad is the kind of more-or-less decent individual victim of unfortunate circumstances but learns to deal with them rather than whining. The second representative character is Casey, an ex-preacher played by John Carradine. The preacher lost the spirit, and it hardly surprises that it's Communism he embraces at the end.An ex-convict, an ex-preacher, ex-farmers, the gallery consists of a bunch of people who 'used to be', and seem incapable to conjugate the life in the future. In a world where farmers are forced to leave the land they walked on and died on, what positive can ever be presaged? The fear ends up killing Grandpa Joad, and the grandmother doesn't outlive him for long. But one person doesn't fear future; it's Ma Joad, and Jane Darnell embodies the pioneer spirit, temerity despite exhaustion, with her droopy but magnificently scintillating eyes. When they live the farm, she doesn't give a last look for they're going to California, and she has no time to mourn the past. She's not braver than the others: the night before, she meditated on her own sadness, alone, but as the heart of the Joadses, it's her duty to exude the happiness the Family is looking forward. The power of \"The Grapes of Wrath\" is to vehicle its powerful and inspirational message through characters rather than facts. Ma Joad, through her eyes, smiles and spirit, incarnates the ferocious and so womanly attachment to practical stuff like eating, living, being clean, she's the unwounded soul of that crisis-stricken America. On the other hand, men are more inclined to think, to translate the facts into abstract notions, and ultimately to fight. Tom Joad is no more eager to become an agitator than anyone else, but the odyssey of the road 66, opened his eyes on the new face of America. Either facing the disdain or the support of fellow citizens, he understands that the salvation cannot come from the individual but from solidarity. His \"We all got little pieces of the one big soul that belongs to everybody\" almost sounds like a spiritual protest slogan.It's even ironic that a right-wing conservative directed \"The Grapes of Wrath\", but the whole socialist and communist undertones were less taboo at that time. The film was adapted from the Pullitzer-prize winning novel of John Steinbeck, released in 1939, at the dawn of a worldwide conflict that put the Red Scare into perspective. Naturally, the farmer's contribution to the war efforts leaded them to a more prosperous state, from which their descendants benefited. But as a slice of the American life during the 30's, the film encapsulates all the desperation, the fears and the hopes of a population that stopped to believe in its own ideals. And now that the world is stricken by another crisis, with the financial system, and the most pervert side of Capitalism as responsible, it's time to look at \"The Grapes of Wrath\" with a new eye for the film is still relevant today, maybe more than when it was praised as one of the greatest American films of all-time.And cinematically speaking, it's also a gripping adaptation that conveys the oppressive feeling of this era through a very powerful black-and-cinematography. There's indeed a magnificent contrast between the shadowy photography of the earlier scenes and the sunnier ones when they arrive in the campground in California. At one part, Casey makes a poignant preach implying that he found a new faith, his face hides in the shadow while his eyes are clearly seen, as to suggest a new lucidity, as if the use of lights allowed him to shine within his own words. The same goes for Henry Fonda during his memorable \"I'll be there\" speech, although the lines seem less spontaneous or more cinematic. And this is not to blame on the script but rather on Fonda who magnificently played a character full of anger and hopes, always distant but never unnoticeable, that's Fonda's charisma, subtle but irreplaceable, Fonda who should have won the Oscar for Best Actor.The film was nominated for several other Oscars, it lost the Best Picture to Alfred Hitchcock's \"Rebecca\" but won a Best Supporting Actress for Jane Darnell and Best Director for John Ford. The two awards are much deserved for Darnell is the heart of the film, and fittingly concludes it with her immortal \"We're the people\", you sure are, Ma \u0085 and John Ford who works each shot with an admirable craftsmanship. Many of them show all the Joadses in one frame as to continually sustain the idea of their unshakable unity, which is the kind of values that the film stands for: unity and solidarity.Quite odd from an American film to celebrate these ideals, but this is what makes it such an endearing, timeless, and universal classic.",

            "content": "At first glance John Ford, a life-long conservative Republican, might seem an odd choice to direct the film of one of the most famous social protest novels in American history. The assignment was a success because Ford approached the novel more from the viewpoint of its human drama than its ideology. There simply isn't a more beautiful black and white film in the American canon. Gregg Toland's cinematography is exquisite; it's no wonder he went on to shoot \"Citizen Kane\" and \"The Best Years of Our Lives.\" Except for the fact that it uses well-known stars instead of non-professional actors, \"The Grapes of Wrath\" has in embryonic form all the stylistic hallmarks of Italian neorealism. Henry Fonda gives the performance of his life as Tom Joad, and Jane Darwell won a well-deserved Oscar for her portrayal of Ma Joad, the eternally stoic earth mother who keeps the family together in the face of insurmountable odds. My favorite character, though, is the renegade preacher, Jim Casy, played by John Carradine at the height of his acting career before his eventual slide into grade-Z horror and exploitation movies. The film's depiction of the persecution and oppression the Oakies faced in their epic trek to California is especially relevant in connection with the plight of undocumented workers in present-day America.",

The Grapes of Wrath is a depressing film, which I knew coming in, but I was surprised by the little instances within the film where kindness was shown. In a film peopled by crooked cops and harsh times, it was refreshing to see these acts of kindness and integrity.The lighting in the film was also superb. In the opening scene where Tom is in his old house at night it really looks like it's at night. And in another scene, where he has a candle at night, it looks real. I know The Grapes of Wrath is the text-book example of natural lighting, but there's a reason for that. :) And without spoiling anything, I love how the film ended.",

            "content": "When John Steinbeck wrote THE GRAPES OF WRATH it became a highly controversial book, which eventually became a highly controversial movie. For my money it's a near perfect film. The direction by two time Oscar winner John Ford is spot on. He tells his story and it moves along at a very brisk pace. One thing I always find that bothers me most about older films is that the pace tends to lag, a result of the film not aging well or it never had a good pace. This film, upon release, was highly successful and earned several academy award nominations including nominations for best picture and best actor for Henry Fonda. Fonda plays Tom Joad, a man on parole who returns home and discovers that his family has been driven off their land and now must leave Oklahoma and head to the promise of work out in California. The film has a dark view of life in the depression, but to view it any other way in regards to this family's story would be doing Steinbeck's material a great disservice. The family has to struggle to stay together. Grandma and Grandpa are quite old when the journey begins; Rosasharn is pregnant and, to leave with them, Tom must violate his parole. The characters in this film are very relatable because of the idea of family. We can all relate to the various things the characters do to help the family and sometimes to get away from it. One of the films biggest assets is Jane Darwell's touching performance as Ma Joad, a wise woman who is the glue that holds together the family unit. This is a film that must be seen, it's a true landmark film and a cinema classic.",

There's a strain that the narrative builds over the watcher, the pressures of an incredibly tough and depressing series of life events, where a viewer may be left thinking: \"well I don't have an issue with dramas or tough films, but why focus on such difficult and common life events ?\" It's one of these things about historical movies - a particular event having occurred doesn't necessarily make for a great film plot or story to tell. The incredibly rough Great Depression years were awful and all, sure, but to make 2 hours plus of film based on the Steinbeck novel... this is like an American Emile Zola, an American Germinal. That monotonous old naturalism/realism narrative of exploring the misery of the working class... why, out of everything else there is to write about or make a film about... You'd ask yourself why an author would focus all his energy on something so bleak and real, there's such a lack of fantasy, the story telling is just totally flat and linear. What, we're barely given 30 seconds of poetry at the end from Fonda and then a speech from the mother in that last scene, but 2hrs10 for that ?...Good film. Tough to watch. 6.5/10.",

The degree of accuracy of the film makes it at times painstakingly uneasy, but nonetheless the subject matter is given appropriate treatment. In terms of lighting, acting and direction it nears perfection too.

Historical films, which tell the history of the USA, as desired by John Ford, seen and perceived by simple individuals. And all three with Henry Fonda.What marks the mind at the vision of these grapes of wrath, it is not so much the story and the subject, hard, but the plastic beauty of the film, the framings, in particular in the medium and long shots. Of course, this story of poor people who immigrate to find work and to be able to live remains a contemporary concern and subject, factually and unfortunately, eighty years later (for the film), one hundred years later for the diegetic story. Here we follow the journeys of a family of farmers who have their farm taken away from them, towards hypothetical work opportunities, and how they are exploited. John Ford focuses on the family, its individuals, and all those who modify it negatively, that is to say those who exploit them, by force, enslave them. John Ford avoids the ultra-maudlin by focusing on the character of Henry Fonda, who is in a way the point of view of the spectator who discovers, and gradually understands how people like them are exploited.The film and the screenplay constantly show the state of pariah and embarrassment that these poor people and immigrants cause: the scene of the bombs in the store, or with Ward Bond, a policeman of the same origin who also repels them.",

Their is also Casey, the backslidden preacher with a heart of gold, Mulley the possibly unhinged farmer, lovable, confused Grandpa, and Ma, the long-suffering matriarch. The difficulty I have with the movie, and what prevents me from giving it a higher score, is that from Casey's death to its ending, the film seems to lose steam.

This is the kind of film you just don't ever want to end. Nunnally Johnson does an incredible job making John Steinbeck's words ready for the screen and John Ford never fails to do justice to the narrative. When a character performs a longer dialog, you can tell you're seeing it with the same impact readers felt reading it. When Tom Joad walks across a lonesome road under the dim blue sky of an early morning you just have to imagine Steinbeck was proud of the people who worked so hard to bring his work to a new medium.The story of the Joad family is a rough one. It begins with Tom fresh out of prison for what is described as self defense. It seems hopeful, but this is the last good fortune he'll see for a long while. Upon finding his family displaced and staying with an uncle, he learns that they've been removed from the farm where the Joad family had been sharecropping for decades. Their seemly only hope is a sizable journey towards California, so they load up a 'jalopy' far past its breaking point to set out on a trail ripe with misery in hopes of rebuilding. You start out rooting for the Joads, how could you not? But the film subjects them to a myriad of misfortunes along the way. Your hope turns to pity quickly, but you can't help but appreciate how much you admire their courage. It's remarkable how much I came to feel for the Joads. Tom is an outstanding protagonist, and you're with him till the very end.A film with a story this great would do fine without being technically impressive and pleasant to look at, but those aspects are wonderfully done too. The film looks incredibly crisp. I didn't manage to forget it was black and white, but I couldn't take my mind off how great it looked. You can see every mark on a person's face, every detail in Tom's scar, and California's ugly brown hills and beautiful green pastures are both presented just as they are to this day.I genuinely loved this movie. It had such an emotional impact. It was hard seeing the Joad family suffer, and it was such a relief to see them finally catch a break. Tom Joad was such a great character that by the end of the film he actually felt like a brother. The film really makes you feel like a Joad yourself, looking back at the family's history. I've been lucky enough to see Cannery Row on a few occasions, and I've seen with my own eyes the fields that the migrant workers of the time would have gone to in search of work. It gave the film a great impact. I'm glad I took the time to watch something so well done that I enjoyed so much.",

Here the stagecoach is replaced by a junk pile truck but the same desert has to be crossed and the same hazards faced. What has been termed Ford's 'rigid purity of visual style' suits this material perfectly and it remains arguably his greatest achievement.It is one of those rare films in which everything works. Producer Darryl F. Zanuck believed in it totally whilst Nunnally Johnson has done a brilliant job on the adaptation. The film is blessed to have Gregg Toland as cinematographer and his low level lighting is wondrous to behold. It is well known that Orson Welles was a Ford devotee and could surely not believe his luck when Toland offered his services on that little number called 'Citizen Kane'. The editing by Robert L. Simpson, one of the finest and longest serving at 20th Century Fox, is exemplary.You certainly won't catch anyone 'acting' here and every performance is of the truest. Henry Fonda as Tom Joad seems born to play the part but that is probably because he succeeds in making it his own.Memories are short and it is difficult now to appreciate the impact Steinbeck's novel once had and naturally later critics in their infinite wisdom have declared it overrated and that his Nobel Prize was undeserved. They are of course fully entitled to their opinion but as long as there exist those who exploit and those who are exploited, the power of both novel and film will never be diminished.",

The film follows a family westward as an exodus of lower class families are forced out of work and their homes due to the firm hand of \"the man.\"While several cinematography elements used within the film, such as the use of black as white as well as some camera tricks, elevated the 'run down' feeling of the Joad family it is my feeling that although the film was an homage to the novel it did not capture the intended thesis of Steinbeck.Throughout the plight of the Joad family the movie focuses simply on the obstacles and hard times that only the Joads had to encounter. I feel the lack of the strong sense of a community in the film really detracted from the moral of the book. The book has a strong lesson of the \"I\" becomes \"we\", whereas the film lacks the sort of artistic ability to really capture that phenomenon. The film puts forth a plot of the Joads against the world and the most important and striking part of the book was realization that a community of perfect strangers had come together, bonding over their nothingness and had become a greater 'fambly' of their own; a unit to reckon with. It is because the Director's cut of the film failed to bring to screen Steinbeck's message of the human nature: of a people coming together when they have no means of living and yet there they are - still fighting the silent fight. While the film has an impressive cast of actors and several other noteworthy aspects of the film which are quite beautiful when speaking the film in parallel with novel, the film has fallen short. This could justly be because of the times period and other circumstances but in short while this film pays homage to this timeless literary work the film is due for a remake with the world being in a place where one is not fearful to expose the truth.

But because it's such an extreme drama it often feels forced as well and causes the movie to be a long watch, even though it really isn't a that long movie. It's just a movie with a real slow pace and yes I would definitely call it boring in parts, even though lots of (dramatic) things are happening within this movie. It really isn't the most exciting movie to watch and therefore also not really a very effective one. Even though I could appreciate the movie for what it was, it just didn't ever grabbed me with its emotions, story or characters, no matter how very well it all got done.But no, I obviously didn't hated this movie, on the contrary really. Seriously, how can you hate such a well crafted movie like this? Even though this movie got released in the early '40's it still has a real typical '30's look and feeling over it. The '30's really used to be the era of some of the best and most effective drama movies.It's a movie that obviously got well directed, by John Ford, who loved to make real 'American' movies. His movies always have something proud and patriotic about it but without the flag waving and such. To the main crowd he is perhaps best known for the work he did within the western genre, with movies such as \"Stagecoach\" and \"Rio Grande\" under his belt.It's also a beautiful looking movie with its cinematography and sets and costumes, which really suits the time period the movie got set in.It has a really great story and amazingly enough things like this really happened back then in America. I didn't knew anything about this piece of history, so I definitely learned something new from it. It's a pretty amazing story and you would have a hard time believing it if you didn't know that things like this really happened in the past. The first halve of the movie is basically a road trip with lots of drama to it obviously, while the rest of the movie also tends to be very dramatic, when the family constantly tries to settle down where ever there is work (and more trouble).Henry Fonda really plays a great role and he himself also considered it to be the role out of his career. He also received an Oscar nomination for his role. The movie also has an amazing supporting cast, with for instance fine acting performances from Jane Darwell and John Carradine. Darwell even won an Oscar for her part in this movie. It was one of the 2 Oscar's this movie received. The other was for director John Ford. Both deserved their win I would say. The movie got nominated in 5 more categories, including Henry Fonda's nomination.Perhaps not the masterpiece I was expecting, it was too overdone and heavy handed for that but nevertheless one great movie, that I surely appreciated watching.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "At 20th Century Fox, the management was worried when producer Darryl Zanuck bought the movie rights to John Steinbeck's latest book. And you can understand why. \"The Grapes of Wrath\" doesn't sound like a suitable story for the cinema. But Zanuck convinced his executives that, in the right hands, the film would be artistically and financially successful. It was just a matter of finding the right director.The film is set during the Great Depression in the 1930s. It focuses on a poor family driven from their Oklahoma home by drought and bank foreclosures. Due to their hopeless situation they head for California along with thousands of other \"Oakies\" seeking a future.After working with Steinbeck's book for several months, Fox Studios sent over a finished screenplay to John Ford. Many feared that the story would be too left-wing for the famous director, but luckily he had no such problems. On the contrary: John Ford thought the tale reminded him of his own family's plight in Ireland during the potato famine. He was more than happy to work with it.Ford and his photographers immediately began shooting the movie on the Fox Studio lot. They tried to get the picture to look as bleak and harsh as a documentary, and it worked. Without using any makeup or diffusion, the actors came across as hard-edged, dirty Dust Bowlers. Finally, Zanuck selected an accordion version of the old standard \"Red River Valley\" to be the film's theme song.After a successful premiere in New York, \"The Grapes of Wrath\" went on to become one of Fox's biggest pictures of 1940. Steinbeck himself wrote that the film was even better than his book. But not everyone was equally happy. The FBI began an investigation of John Ford, John Steinbeck and others involved in the film for suspicious Communist activity. In the end, of course, nothing came out of it.",

            "content": "Besides entertaining, the motion picture can educate, inspire, or raise awareness about important issues occurring or having occurred in the world. \"The Grapes of Wrath\" is a film about the Great Depression. We don't learn much about it from the film, but the film's quality does something just as good, it raises the viewer's curiosity about it, and he is inspired to look it up. What caused it? How widespread was it? Did anyone actually starve to death because of it? If so, how many? How did it end, i.e. what was the solution to conjure up its demise?Many films have been made about the Great Depression. This is one of the best. It is based on the novel by John Steinbeck (who also wrote \"Of Mice and Men\" and was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962), \"The Grapes of Wrath\" was nominated for the Best Picture of 1940 by the American Motion Picture Academy (Hitchcock's \"Rebecca\" won).Henry Fonda gives the performance of a lifetime as a young man who has returned from jail to discover that his family's spirit has been crushed from their loss of land and home. They come across a flyer advertising 800 agricultural jobs in California and decide to head out west. Unfortunately, thousands of people responded in the same way to the add. Rather than hire only the manpower needed, the abusive employers hired all they could but cut their wages lower than what was required for survival.The Great Depression's desolation both in the environment and in the spirit of the people is effectively re-created. The characters were memorable with their weak command of English. \"Grandpa\" was a hoot. This is a classic. 10/10.",

            "content": "...Well, as starkly realistic as Hollywood could get in the 1940's.Ford's adaptation of Steinbeck's amazing social novel is terrific. The atmosphere of the source material is brilliantly maintained. The thing that impressed me most was that the film wasn't glossed over in the Hollywood studio-style. Yes, there are some omissions in the plot to comply with the Hayes Code, but it's still very dark and realistic. The hungry children rummaging through the waste piles for a sliver of food is shockingly compelling, as are the machines sent out to destroy the farmer's houses, crushing them easily as the onlookers watch in disbelief. It feels authentic.Henry Fonda is perfectly cast as Tom Joad, the hero of the tale. Fonda's underplaying and sense of the 'everyman' suit his character perfectly. The supporting cast are terrific, and they are not glossed-over, either. Jane Darwell appears to have just jumped off the pages of Steinbeck's epic as Ma Joad. So many families made the journey from the Mid-West to California, the land of supposed 'milk and honey' (which the Joad's find out is not true), but the Joad's struggle feels very personal to us.Very depressing in content- I had to watch this film in portions simply because it overwhelmed my emotions so completely. But the Great Depression was an awful event in America's history, and it's portrayed so accurately here. Students should watch this at school to realize how lucky they've got it now, and how dangerous it would be to fall into a recession once again (it would be different now, but still have the same effect on morale). This is draining to watch, but ultimately uplifting. Ford's direction is always convincing; Steinbeck's great work is in fine hands. The black-and-white photography emphasises the bleakness and realism.10/10.",

            "content": "I hesitate to write a bad review of The Grapes of Wrath because I know that to many people who view it apolitically, it is simply a very well made drama. To such people my criticism may seem merely like muckraking. If, however, you are observing the misinformation that the premise of this film is built upon, then I believe it legitimately fails. I understand the poetic license that artists take to make a good story, and I am willing to grant that license. However, I feel that, when tallied, this film's erroneous statements go far beyond the pale of poetry and cross into the realm of propaganda and silliness. It's the difference between \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" vs. Charlie Daniels \"In America\". The former inspires me, the latter is a joke.Another aspect of the movie that bothered me was its disconcerting take on morals. It begins, fittingly, with someone being mocked for obeying a rule. Henry Fonda, a murderer just out on parole, berates a truck driver for obeying a rule that prohibits him from giving rides. What if Fonda had hijacked him, would the truck driver be a prude or an idiot? In the next scene, God gets the ax. Fonda comes across a disillusioned vagabond, the family's ex-parson. He brags that his sermons were emotional hype and confesses that he liked to sleep with the women that got caught up in \"the spirit\" at his meetings. Now, he says, he has lost hope. He does not state this as a fault, so much as it is confusing to him why \"the spirit\" has left him. Strangely, this later state of the preacher is looked upon by Fonda as being clairvoyant. Everything that happens in The Grapes of Wrath happens within the context of morality being a relative thing, certainly one devoid of divine appointment. Everything from lying to murder is excusable if done by the right people or for the right reasons. A few examples: Upon seeing Fonda out of prison, most of his family is hoping he broke out. His parole comes as a disappointment.The murder he was sentenced to seems irrelevant.The sharecroppers are willing to kill the owners of the land to stop them from evicting them (they don't because it \"won't do no good\" not because it would be morally reprehensible).(slight spoiler) Fonda murders another man for murdering his friend, and Fonda's mother not only excuses the murder without knowing what her son's motive was, but offers to cover it up by hiding her son.I, personally, have a hard time rooting for such protagonists. I also found Fonda's character to be too abusive and insolent many times.Overall, I find the authors socialist overtones clich\u00e9 and cockeyed:Its opinion of authority is comical. All cops are evil thugs, all employed towns people are absentee cowards, all successful businessmen are thoughtless criminals, and essentially everybody in the film that has employment are only out for themselves and their first impulse is always to be rude and uncaring.The film's opinion of how people treated each other in the '30's is askew. No doubt, some people where cold and heartless, that is a given at any time, but where are the good people? There is not a single group or individual (with any means, that is) helping any of these people, esp. children? Where are the soup kitchens, churches, etc..? The premise of the script is built upon this nonsense. Quick research into the Great Depression will reveal a contrary reality. People where mostly very kind and helpful to each other. It's how we survived as a country. Many other countries turned to anarchy.Its opinion of progress is very cockeyed. The tractors are pictured as giant evil job gobblers. In reality, modernization made it so poor people could get better paying jobs and live a much higher quality of life.Its opinion of what role religion plays in American life is cockeyed.Its opinion of land ownership is cockeyed. If I rent land, and the owner wants to take it back, that is part of my contractural agreement. Oddly, it appears the farm owners were actually doing them a favor by getting rid of them. If they were not successful, their grandparents should have thrown in the towel decades before. But I am expected to sympathize with this.Its opinion of how the government helps people is not only cockeyed, it's backwards. If anyone is guilty of screwing people and taking away their rights, it's government. Reality is so much different that this issue becomes a farce. In one scene, the only thing missing from the government run workers camp were angles playing harps. You may argue that Roosevelt's WPA helped people, but many scholars argue that it actually prolonged the depression.The entire premise of the \"Okie migration\" is not factual as presented here, Google the topic to find out. For example; the migration of the Midwest was transpiring since the teens. The bulk of it occurred in the 40's, not the thirties, as employment became abundant in California due to WWII. There are a plethora of other non-truths in this script. So much so that the movie was protested by many people in California. Steinbeck grossly misrepresents the facts.I could go on much longer, but I am limited to 1000 words. All of this is not to say The Grapes of Wrath does not have good and valid points about how we should help people and think of them before profits. I just think they are lost in an ocean of deception and lies. As a movie making effort: 9.5 out of 10. As a whole: 3 out of 10.",

Eventually, Tom and his family must escape... which is as suspenseful as things get... And soon enough the Joads find utopia!Once the \"Okie\" clan acquires solace in a village run by the Department of Agriculture (i.e. The Government), where each member pulls his own weight (although there's not much work to be done other than chores within the camp), the political agenda is blatantly unveiled, only this movie, made in 1940, was one of the first of its kind and credit must be given for that alone...But alas, with Henry Fonda's stark realism and Carradine's offbeat charm aside, the performances seem right out of a stage play (especially the overrated Oscar winning role) while the unceasing, melodramatic tragedy is so deliberately overboard, it's difficult to find any real story there at all.",

Basically Tom Joad (Oscar nominated Henry Fonda) has returned home after serving four years in prison for killing a man, and he is joined on his journey by faithless former preacher Casy (John Carradine), and together they find the farm deserted. Tom finds his family who tell him that they were evicted, and the extended family of eight have to pack their things and set on the road to California, and there they hope to find work. The Grandpa (Charley Grapewin) dies from a stroke along the way on Route 66, and they have no choice but to bury his body on a roadside, and after being warned about the lack of jobs at their destination, Grandma (Zeffie Tilbury) dies also before they reach the border. They soon find a travelling camp populated by children, and a man and the sheriff do come offering the family members work, but with no indication of what the salary is, this man with the sheriff is trouble apparently. The sheriff killed the man, and Tom knocked out the sheriff before getting away, and the rest of the family keep travelling until the find a farm that needs workers, but it is suspicious for being surrounded by barbed wire and armed guards. They earn very little money when they accept a job picking pears, and Tom walking around comes across Casy again who is planning a strike with fellow labourers, but then thugs kill Casy and gash Tom. The family move on again and find a US government camp which has much better living conditions, such as toilets and showers, but they are wary of thugs coming and need the sheriff to take control. Tom must go away because the sheriff is looking for him, and he leaves his mother, Ma Joad (Oscar winning Jane Darwell), thinking that she won't see him again, but she is hopeful about the future heading for work in the north. Also starring Dorris Bowdon as Rose-of-Sharon 'Rosasharn' Rivers, Russell Simpson as Pa Joad, O.Z. Whitehead as Al and John Qualen as Muley. Fonda is alright as the one who almost leads the family, and Darwell is indeed intriguing as the mother of the family who is tries to keep spirits up. I will be honest, I didn't really pay enough attention to or understand the plot, and I didn't really understand the leading character's heroism, I'd probably only see it the once, but there are some good moments, costumes and landscapes to just about keep you watching, a reasonably worthwhile classic period drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Film Editing, Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay. Tom Joad was number 12 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 21 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Very good!",

Heartbreaking scenes include the sudden deaths, haggling for very small amounts of food and the children's surprise the first time they see a flushing toilet. Near the end, Tom takes breaks from bare survival mode to reflect on the unequal system perpetuating his poverty, taking up the cause of worker agitation but not getting far enough for the film to be truly subversive.

One of the hardest hit areas was Oklahoma. Many Oklahomans went west to California in search of work after being driven from their lands. The movie picks up with Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) coming home from prison to find that his family is gone. He was told a story by Muley (John Qualen) how all families were being forced off of their property by the banks. It was a depressing scene to see playout as Muley impotently stood by while a worker bulldozed his home for a $3 payday.Tom Joad caught up with his family before they got a chance to leave and the lot of them headed west to California after seeing a handbill requesting 800 pickers for a farm. When they reached California it was anything but a warm welcome. They faced one adversity after another with the police being the source of many of their woes.It was quite interesting to see the police being depicted the way they were. They were tools of the wealthy as opposed to being employees of the state paid to protect and serve. You couldn't help but feel for the Joad family. They only wanted to work for a living wage and be left alone. This movie showed a cross section of the worst of capitalism with the worst of government officials coming down on the most vulnerable of people.",

            "review_title": "An account of people trapped in the cage of poverty and misery !!!",
            "content": "The Grapes of Wrath directed by John Ford from a screenplay by Nunnally Johnson was the film adaptation of the very well known and renowned book of the same name by John Steinbeck. The film like the book is set during the era of the Great Depression in the 1930s and follows the Joad family from Oklahoma as they deal with poverty on their way to the 'promised land' of California after being thrown out of their own land and property.The themes of the film revolve around the concept of the loss of home. After the Joads get uprooted from their home like many other farmer families, they head out for California in their truck. This truck becomes their mobile home. They become wanderers in search of a real home. It is unreal how the issue of migrants that enrich Steinbeck's novel and Ford's film is still extremely relevant to this very day. We see the local officials mistreat, mislead and exploit them and all the poor migrants like the Joads go along with it with the hope that there might be a light at the end of the tunnel. The Darwinian concept of the 'survival of the fittest' also comes very much into the equation. Once the Joads leave their land, some members of the family lose their grit, hope and conviction like Grandpa, Grandma and Pa, while on the other hand, the misery and sorry plight of the circumstances emboldens Ma and makes her the source of strength for everyone including Tom. Tom Joad is a very interesting character. He starts out as the angry loner. He then comes into contact and becomes a part of the family unit. But the misery and struggles force him in an ironic sense to re-embrace the identity of the outlaw loner to bring about a change. The purity and sweetness of the mother-son relationship between Tom and Ma is given a lot of attention by Ford and Johnson, even more so than Steinbeck did in the novel.Ford's direction in the film is understated and not very flashy. There are moments of great artistic imagery, eg: the 3 shadows trampled by the tractor marks, Gregg Toland's brilliant cinematography under Ford's direction involving shadows specially in the scene where Tom and Casy meet Muley, the brilliant shot where the Joad family leaves on their truck bidding adieu to their home and Ford decides to hold the shot a few seconds longer after they have left to show the wind, dust and garbage blowing towards the house,etc. Ford's direction in the scenes in the Transient Camps is absolutely brilliant. He uses the moving camera from the perspective of the Joads to introduce them and the viewers to all the other migrants. The other aspects of those scenes involving the hungry kids are very touching.But the film I thought is flawed. First of all, clearly due to all the restrictions that films of that era were plagued by, there are a lot of crucial aspects of the original novel that get watered down a bit. I am certainly not someone who gets annoyed when the film is very different to the original source material because I have the maturity to understand that cinema and literature are two completely different fields. But I do think if the political aspect of the novel was explored more boldly in the film, it would have worked to its benefit. Another aspect of the film that put me off a bit is some of the hokey nature of the written lines. Nunnally Johnson's writing at times gets too cheesy and overt. The overt nature of some of the lines spoken by the characters might work on the page of a book, but on screen, it does stick out in an ugly way. The acting by the ensemble cast is also a bit too theatrical at times which made it difficult for me to maintain a constant emotional attachment with the characters. Although the quality of acting is not consistent from everyone, but Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, Jane Darwell as Ma Joad and John Qualen as Muley are the ones who stand out. Fonda accurately conveys the repressed anger and frustration that makes up Tom's character with moments of touching emotions. Darwell is as likable as ever as Ma. She exudes a caring and loving quality that is impossible to avoid. She also plays the character with some strength as Ma does in a way become the backbone of the family after they leave their home. Although John Qualen has a peculiar appearance, but the power of his performance forced me to really empathise with Muley's pains and struggles.'The Grapes of Wrath' is not flawless. In my view it has its fair share of issues much of which was down to rigid restrictions that were imposed upon the films of that era. But even with its flaws, it still is a very solid John Ford film which made me feel for the characters. Just like the novel, it forces the viewer to put themselves in the shoes of the central characters and live the struggle with them.",

            "content": "Any John Steinbeck title-turned-film tends to scare away contemporary viewers with thoughts of two-plus hours of depressing country drama, but we often forget how radical Steinbeck was for his time, particularly with his Depression-era Dust Bowl novel \"The Grapes of Wrath.\" With an adaptation by one of Hollywood's first great directors (and greatest frontier/Western director) in John Ford, this film is anything but a classic adapted for the screen just for the sake of it.Starring Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, \"The Grapes of Wrath\" centers on Joad, recently paroled after killing a man in self-defense, and his large family (including parents, grandparents, uncle, sister, brother, etc.) traveling out to California after being forced out of their Oklahoma home in search of work. This one flame of a new life out west, however, slowly begins to flicker away as they find out more and more that they're one of thousands competing for the same few hundred low-wage contractor jobs.The realization creeps up on the characters and even ourselves. A whopping 70 years later, if you come to the film without putting your history cap on, you'll almost be convinced the Joads have a shot. Screenwriter Nunnally Johnson hinges much of the film's movement on moments of realization, creating a growing shadow. Ford gives each scene a chance to sink in with his lingering closing shots that slowly fade to black. These are ancient foreshadow techniques, but Ford reminds us why they're timeless.The building tension keeps \"Wrath\" from festering too long in thoughts about good and evil and what actions make a man one or the other, which was sort of radical thinking for the Depression era. The former preacher Casy (John Carradine) who lives like a hobo and claims he no longer has the spirit because he cannot determine automatically what is right or wrong anymore was more progressive than we realize. Occasionally the script will go back on itself or insert somewhat needless moments of pause for Ma Joad (Oscar winner Jane Darwell) to sermonize about Steinbeck's themes, but audiences probably needed to be hit over the head with this stuff in 1940; it is a different philosophy, that's for sure.Tom Joad's famous speech to Ma as he leaves his family to go off and fight the cause (\"wherever there's a fight, so hungry people can eat, I'll be there ... \") is one of the earliest American \"one person can make a difference fighting for what he/she believes in\" speeches on camera. Since 1940 we've had so many more examples of real life people who have stood up for a cause and fought injustice. \"The Grapes of Wrath\" might seem unoriginal in that thought, but in American history, it's hardly the case. And most certainly, that message will never become irrelevant in spite of hope that it one day might be.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",

            "content": "As a film of the 1940's, the Grapes of Wrath does a wonderful thing.  It shows us humanity in only the way that someone like John Ford could show it. Primarily known as a director of westerns, Ford helms this project with all the love and care you'd expect from someone entrusted with such a great and beloved work of American Literature.  Even seen as a bit dated, the film harkens back to a time in American History when the government was literally throwing people off their land just so they (the government) could have more and more room for agriculture and farming purposes.  So, the Joad family like millions of other families in the midst of the Great Depression flees to California. They do this simply because they believe that work, not to mention a better life will be found there.  However, once they arrive in California the Joads begin to see just how wrong they were with so many of their assumptions.This has to be the definitive Henry Fonda film.  Fonda plays Tom Joad with sort of an everyman type of quality.  However, Fonda lost the Best Actor Oscar to James Stewart in The Philadelphia Story.  The Grapes of Wrath received two statuettes that year, Best Supporting Actress for Jane Darwell's iconic portrayal of Ma Joad, the undeviating strength at the core of the Joad clan and Best Director for John Ford (his second Oscar after 1935's The Informer).  The Grapes of Wrath was also nominated in the categories of Best Original Screenplay, Best Film Editing and Best Sound Recording, losing in all three instances.  The film lost Best Picture to Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca.All in all, this is an important piece in a director's legacy of great films.  John Ford would follow The Grapes of Wrath with Oscar wins for both 1941's How Green Was My Valley and 1952's The Quiet Man, not to mention what I consider his greatest film ever, 1956's The Searchers with John Wayne.My rating: 2 and a half stars",

            "review_title": "A Masterful Film That Lives Up to Its Reputation",
            "content": "Grapes of Wrath, The (1940) **** (out of 4) I'm sure many could take a political angle when discussing John Steinbeck's novel, which was the bases for this film, which today is considered one of the greatest pictures ever made but I think trying to label it left-wing or right-wing would really kill the deeper meanings in the film. The story is quite simple as a poor family from Oklahoma are kicked off their land and they decide to travel West where they think plenty of work will await them. The family heads off for a better life but soon they're hit with one heartbreak after another. Having watched this for the first time in over twenty-years, what really struck me was the simple message of the story and the rather simple tones that director Ford used to get those messages across. This certainly isn't a film that preaches to you but at the same time it's impossible not to deeply feel what it's saying as the film perfectly shows everything that's great about America and what's bad about it. There are so many classic. landmark moments in this film that many others simply get overlooked or are never really discussed at all. One such scene happens early on when the family, slowly breaking apart, enter a diner wanting ten-cents worth of bread but the rather snotty waitress tells them all that's available is fifteen-cents. What follows is certainly very touching and shows what good can come out of people. Of course, there's also the ugly side mainly dealing with, as Tom Joad puts it, millions of acres of land and thousands of farmers going hungry. Ford clearly wanted to make people feel as close to these characters as possible and I think one major reason he succeeds is because of the documentary feel he creates. The natural lighting was the perfect choice because it really makes you feel the dirt that is on all these characters, it makes you feel the baking sun and it makes you feel as if you're along for this sad journey. This journey from Oklahoma to California is filmed in such a way that you can't help but feel for the people going through it but it also gives you this strange feeling that you can follow your dreams no matter how unlikely they are to come true. Many stated that this film is about dreams that go unfulfilled while others see the ending as an incredibly positive thing to give one hope for going forward. I think my feelings are somewhere in between but there's no question the final speech by Tom Joad deserves its place in history.Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad and that \"simple man\" quality of the actor was certainly very much needed here and there's no question that it was born here. While Fonda turned in many good to very good performances before this film, it's clear that this here is where he really took off and this simple man part is something he would go onto play countless times in his career. Just that laid back approach to the way he walked and talked really took this character off the book pages and made him a film icon. Fonda certainly gets much of the spotlight but the supporting players are all just as impressive. Jane Darwell is perfect as the strong mother, Charley Grapewin as Grandpa, Russell Simpson as Pa Joad and John Qualen as Muley. Eddie Quillan, Frank Sully, Frank Darien, Darryl Hickman, Ward Bond and Joe Sawyer also appear. Then there's John Carradine who turns in one of the finest performances that any actor gave in any film from this era. It's always rather shocking to see how many terrific performances he gave early in his career before turning to \"C\" and \"Z\" pictures towards the end of his life. It's also rather sad that he wasn't given better film parts because his role as Casy.THE GRAPES OF WRATH was considered for many decades to be the greatest American movie but then the praise for CITIZEN KANE came around and while the Ford film has fallen over the past few decades it's certainly a film that still touches many. I don't think there's anyway to deny the true power as it's almost what one would call the perfect film. Everything on a technical level is top-notch and you're certainly not going to find many more movies with such terrific performances by an entire cast. Some might try to tear it apart for some political reasons but that would really be a shame and it would only show the flaws of said viewer and not the film itself.",

            "content": "The very first commentary on this movie says it all. Although I also was living during this disaster, for some reason I was not aware of its affects on my family, who came to this country with great wealth in 1924. By 1930, it was bankrupt; I kept wondering why we were moving from the big house to a succession of smaller houses on the same property, then entirely off of it. Mine was such a happy childhood, I can only surmise the loss of wealth did not register with me. I don't even remember being aware of it; by the time my family became being near penniless, I was the only child left at home - I was the youngest. My parents' battle to win it is a testimony to their resiliency and bravery. My dad became a master-carpenter, and helped build-renovate many homes his wealth had helped other people to obtain. My mother became the town-sempstress, sewing garments she would not have worn in earlier days.I suspect I may had read \"The Grapes of Wrath\" shortly after its publication; I was a precocious child. I know of my family's travails only from other family-members, during the Great Depression which could so easily happen again, for different reasons. I doubt seriously if today's citizens of this country - and the millions of immigrants - could survive one. Reading other commentaries on this movie, I wonder how-and-who decided it is of a communistic theme - I must have been too naive to grasp it from the novel. Although they were worlds apart in their cultures, my mother certainly was very much like Ma Joad, both angels on Earth. I proudly associate the two; my mom put-away her aristocratic demeanor to help pay my dad's bills. Ma Joad BECAME aristocratic through her gentility and compassion. I am so happy I inherited many of my mother's characteristics, because lineage means nothing to me. It's the person-as-is I love.\"The Okies\", although they received much less sympathy than those hordes who cross California's southern border with Mexico, brought the same magic power to California, because they did the dirty work. We politically correctly say, \"that's work we won't do\" -hmmmmmm. One doesn't know what one would do, until a situation confronts them. Being retired from night-club entertaining, I view everyone as being equal: I often confronted individuals of foreign birth with unkind things to say about America. I could only smile and ask, \"If that is true, why is everyone in the world trying to get here?\" Many of the commentators on this movie have written cogently about it. There is not much more I can add, except to say it causes me to weep for the goodness of the people during those times, when they had every reason to be evil. I see no comparison in the quality of the film to \"Citizen Kane\", because that film is mostly fiction. \"The Grapes of Wrath\" is a true-to-life historical telling of real situations. They are rampant all over the world, and in some parts of this nation. Let's pray they can be alleviated for everyone's good.I think Henry Fonda portrayed Tom Joad brilliantly, but don't see too much difference in his other roles. Perhaps he became a \"big star\" because of his cunning, to choose roles that would fit him. I agree with those who write the awarding of his Oscar for \"On Golden Pond\" was the culmination of a popularity contest. There is a dark rumor (in Hollywood) \"Pond's\" theme wasn't all that fictional; in true life, Jane and Dad didn't get along that well.....Watch \"Grapes\" as often as you can - there are many great lessons to be learned from it. It deserves every accolade given to it, and none of the tacky criticisms - it is pure art that just happens to depict a dreadful period of our history. I can't give anything but high praise for all who had a part in its production. \"Happy are those who are persecuted because they are good, for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs.\" Mathew 5:10.",

            "content": "As I write this, there has been rioting in the streets in Argentina and Brazil, rioting by the African and middle eastern immigrants in France and here in the US, tens of thousands of the poor remain displaced from their homes following Hurricane Katrina. A line from one of the best films of the year, \"Secuestro Express,\" sums up perfectly all these people's common problem.\"Half the world suffers from malnutrition, the other half from obesity.\" Even though it was made 65 years ago, \"The Grapes of Wrath\" is still relevant today, for the grinding poverty depicted in this film and the struggle to overcome it --in some cases just to survive it --remains today the all consuming battle for a large portion of the world's population.We should not forget just how controversial John Steinbeck's novel was when it was first published all those years ago. Called socialist propaganda by politicians and branded a pack of lies by the big California farmers, the book went on to achieve great acclaim. Yet it and stories like it will always be lightning rods for controversy because they dare to suggest that what separates the halves and have not's is not always just how hard people are willing to work. Some of those who work the hardest --and there may be no harder work than stoop labor --wind up with the least.Plenty of good hard work went into the motion picture version of this story of Dust Bowl immigrants of the 1930s trying to start a new life in California.The film, of course, was the work of some of the best in Hollywood. Produced by Darryl F. Zanuck, one of the industry's greatest producers, adapted for the screen by Nunally Johnson (Jesse James), photographed by Gregg Toland (Citizen Kane); staring one of the screen's greatest actors, Henry Fonda, backed by a remarkable cast of character actors including Jane Darwell and John Carradine, and helmed by a candidate for the honor of Hollywood's greatest director, John Ford, this film was assembled like a fine Swiss watch, which is probably why it continues to tick today, well over half a century later.Ford was at the top of his game when he undertook the project and its brimming with his unmatched visuals, thanks to the camera-work of Gregg Toland. From the opening shot of a solitary figure walking down a highway towards a diner, to shots of the Joad family, piled in their jalopy truck, passing through an Indian reservation in New Mexico, to the film's signature shot, as they wind their way through a transient camp outside Bakersfield, California, Ford and Toland use the camera to advance the idea that these are people on an odyssey, a search for a better life in a sometimes beautiful, but often hostile environment. Many directors are capable of making pretty pictures. Ford proves in \"Grapes of Wrath\" that you can tell a compelling story without a word being spoken.But like all great movies, from Murnau's \"Sunrise\" to Coppola's \"Godfather,\" this film is about a lot more than pretty pictures. The movie's words are powerful and haunting and resonate today. When John Qualen, playing the deranged sharecropper, Muley, describes how the Oakies have been pushed off their land by the banks; or when David Hughes playing a discouraged immigrant coming back from California empty handed, gives his dire warning about the perils the travelers face, you cannot help but be moved. And of course, there is Henry Fonda, who delivers his now legendary speech at the movie's end, as he sets out on his own to see what can be done about the plight of the poor. The screen may have never produced a better piece of dialog.\"The Grapes of Wrath\" continues to stand today as a landmark of American movie making and a film well worth the time of anyone who wants to try to understand what for much of mankind remains the most important struggle --the struggle for survival..",

            "content": "A revisiting of this movie merely confirms what is already established as fact: that this movie is great. It's grim story about people struggling to survive. That these conditions existed in the United States is a disgrace. To be thrown off the land is bad enough, but then to be humiliated compounds the injustice. The story is told in the form of semi-documentary which gives it further authenticity. The movie is about land. People own it, farm it, exploit it, divide it, fight for it, defend it, plow it, drive over it, drive through it. The people are transiting; the land stays. Tom Joad enters and Tom Joad exits; he is a metaphor for the transitory nature of existence. The only thing stable is the land. Ma Joad is trying to keep the family together but it's a losing battle. Only the will to survive gets them through. This movie is an incredibly powerful story, strongly acted, and told with candor.The Grapes of Wrath is director John Ford's homage to nature and a warning to all - that nature, in the form of rough terrain, inclement weather and immense distances, can be lethal to humans. In this movie the land is more than just mere scenery, more than just a back drop for a story, more than just a passing reference, it is an integral player, indeed it is the story itself. Briefly, the movie is about a family, the Joads of Oklahoma, who, after being evicted from their farm during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, become homeless and, in quest of work and a more secure place to live, embark on a long journey through prairie and desert to California. For them, California is the proverbial land of milk and honey and holds for them a promise of a new and better life, much like the ancient Hebrews may have felt when they left Egypt in quest for their promised land. As the Joads travel west in the their broken-down jalopy they are dwarfed by the sheer immensity of the landscape. The movie features several panoramic vistas of the rugged western landscape, prairie and desert, geographical barriers that the Joads must surmount to reach their goal and places where they can die. For the land is not friendly and benign; instead it is a source of contention and a cause for grief, such as that visited upon the Joads as they lose their homes and possessions and are forced to migrate in order to survive. The Joads' vulnerability is further reinforced by the distances they must travel and the stress caused by the move itself. Two members of the family die while on the road and another disappears; nothing is close by. Driving many miles means having to deal with the possibility of their truck breaking down en route and becoming stuck in the middle of nowhere. And like the land itself, the people encountered by the Joads on their journey are surly and begrudging at best. The message is unmistakable. Nature can crush us at any time and must be respected for what it is, an all-encompassing, awesome, stark entity that is both life giving and deadly, especially when ignored, as the Joads learned as the \"wind\" destroyed their lives, perhaps as a pay back for the way the land was abused. And when the Joads finally arrive in California, reality quickly sets in and with it comes more trouble and disappointment, all of this having to do with the land, which again poses a threat to the Joads' survival. The story ends with Tom Joad, who is in trouble with the law, shown trekking across the land and the rest of family again on the move as they continue to seek work. The foreboding mood that permeates this movie is further enhanced by the black-and-white photography that further brings out the stark emptiness and vastness of the land. This movie is a dramatic statement that warns the audience that human kind must be cognizant of the whims of nature for nature is something that cannot be ignored or trifled with. In the 1930s people did not treat the land with respect and the land responded in kind. That the Joads got caught up with that is the stuff for a dramatic story but nature itself is beyond our ability to control as so aptly shown in this movie. We build dams and they inevitably fail. We build dikes to keep out the ocean yet we still have floods. We build huge ships that sink. We build airplanes and rockets that crash. We build mighty bridges and buildings and they collapse. And in Grapes of Wrath, we farm the land and the soil turns into dust. And THAT is the story.",

Wherever there's a cop, I'll be there.\" If you actually make it to the point in the movie where Henry Fonda rattles off his big speech, congratulations. The movie is so dismal, and his voice is so irritating, it's hard to make it through the entire movie all at once.The only redeeming parts of this classic John Ford drama are the supporting characters. Jane Darwell (rewarded with an Oscar statuette and a Hot Toasty Rag nomination) plays the long-suffering mom. She's tough and hardened, and has sacrificed her whole life for her family and the farm. I can never make it past her famous packing scene without crying.Charley Grapewin also gives an impressive, but brief, performance. He plays the grandfather, without his teeth and with a constant palsy. It's very sad to hear his wobbly voice, but it's shades of things to come. To see more of a great thing, rent Tobacco Road to see his Rag-winning performance. John Carradine and John Qualen are familiar faces, even though the box office draw is Henry Fonda. Had he spent the entire movie in his little cap just enjoying some close-ups, it would have been much better. But, we all know his voice is annoying, and to hear him speak line after line of John Steinbeck drama... Well, it takes a very alert audience member.If you haven't seen this classic yet, you'll probably feel compelled to watch it. But don't worry if you don't like it. You're in good company. Try a different Steinbeck; there are many, many movies to choose from.",

            "content": "This powerful film starring Henry Fonda and directed by John Ford chronicles the Joads, a family from Oklahoma, driven from their home by greedy bankers and corporations after their livelihood was ruined by the dust storms of the mid 30s. These storms displaced around 500,000 people, many of whom went to California looking for work. This caused a serious overage of pickers and workers in that state and many of the displaced ended up and starving and suffering in squalor in miserable camps. Steinbeck chronicled this misery (his own version of Les Miserables) in Grapes of Wrath, which was adapted the following year for the screen. Henry Fonda took the role of Tom Joad, which turned his career into gold. All of the adults in the cast performed marvelously, from the crazy grandpa dreaming of squishing around in grapes, to Casey the former preacher who just wasn't sure anymore to Ma, (who won an Oscar along with John Ford for the film). The overwhelming message pounds home the misery of these people, the poor treatment they receive at the hands of the government, police and big business and how unions and worker rights are the solution to these ills. This movie is like bran muffins. Not just regular bran muffins, but bran muffins where part of the oil/butter has been replaced with apple sauce to make them more healthy than they already are. At first you are a little bothered and afraid that the taste will be diminished by the alteration, but it's not, they taste just as good, and the muffin provides lots of fiber for your health and little fat to make it guilt-free. The moistness is even enhanced to make the interior extremely moist and inviting. The little crumbs that you would normally discard are captured and gobbled up, making a very satisfying, healthy breakfast. 8/10http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies",

            "content": "This film of John Steinbeck's classic novel falls into the rare category of: must be watched by everyone. Everyone will come away with the stark impression of the Great Depression in America, the tragic lives led by families of this era, and the tenant farmer/slave wage and plantation mentality which still thrives (in more covert form) in the U.S today.Henry Fonda as Tom Joad returns to his family in Oklahoma to learn that they are being thrown off their land by a corporation; no work existed in the area, and flyer's proclaiming livable wages for peach pickers in California ostensibly represent a future for the Joad family. They pack up Mother (Jane Darwell, wonderful performance), grandma, grandpa and assorted children including Rose of Sharon who becomes pregnant en route to California.The vehicle they drive thousands of miles is a dilapidated jalopy, and they live a hardscrabble life, stopping at a gas station and barely able to afford a day old loaf of bread. The scene where grandpa buys the two children peppermint candy is particularly sad, the waitress charges him less as she realizes the family is dirt poor. Another telling scene is when Tom (Fonda) stops at a gas station and two arrogant gas station attendants survey his situation, saying. ...\" those Okies just aren't human, living like they do\"... the rejection of middle class America of these peoples plight is rancid and prevalent.It still exists today.Eventually the Joads get to a labor camp where they are treated like criminals and live in sub-human conditions. The DP captures the stark images of starving sad children begging mother (Darwell) for food, any food. They are all starving.Eventually the Joads drive on to find another camp, run by the department of agriculture, which at least provides clean water, bathrooms and food. Grandma dies when they finally reach California soil, the promised land.Henry Fonda is frankly flawless in this performance, depicting a young man attempting to make a life, but having no resources, no societal support.A truly perfect film, worth several viewings as you realize there are still impoverished people in America living this way, whether in the foothills of Appalachia, or the sugar cane fields of South Florida. 10/10.",

There were some scenes that it was easy to tell that there was a painted backdrop ( for example when Tom is arriving back home for the first time, he is walking through a field and there's an obvious backdrop.)The fact that the director was able to create a convincing look at the dustbowl so soon after it occurred definitely speaks for his talent.",

            "content": "For the adaptation of John Steinbeck's classic novel, the obvious choice for director was probably not John Ford, who was at that time best known for historical dramas. However, if the setting was not typical John Ford then its themes of family relationships, community spirit and social outcasts persevering in the face of all adversity certainly were. It was also a task which members of Ford's stock company of actors \u0096 Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell, John Carradine and John Qualen \u0096 were more than suited to.Considering it is a contemporary drama shot in black-and-white, the images in Grapes of Wrath are startling, from the opening shot of a distant Henry Fonda approaching a crossroads to Jane Darwell's close-up monologue with which the films closes. The director of photography was Greg Toland, one of the best in the business at the time. Combined with Ford's effortless talent for shot composition the results are among the finest images in black-and-white cinema.Ford knows exactly when to edit and when to move the camera, usually for maximum emotional impact. In a scene where Ma Joad is burning some personal possessions in preparation to leave the farm, he cuts to a dirty mirror reflection of her. It's hard to explain how but it works perfectly. He also makes far more use of close-ups than is his norm, building up a greater level of intimacy and bringing the emotions to the fore. This occasionally makes the lengthy patches of dialogue seem a little corny, but this is often a problem with motion pictures adapted from novels which few directors have managed to get round successfully.John Carradine performs in what was probably the best role of his life as the preacher Casey. He's cast completely against type (he usually played sinister villains), but he makes the role his own, creating a character who appears simple on the surface, but is full of down-to-earth wisdom and humanity underneath. There's also a small yet memorable appearance from another Ford regular, John Qualen, who gives a spirited performance as the farmer Muley. In what are some of the best scenes in the film he vents his anger and frustration at being turfed off his land, eventually breaking down until he's nothing but a ghost of his former self.Despite Ford winning Best Director at the Academy Awards for Grapes of Wrath (one of only two Oscars it received), it's probably more a classic borne out of group effort than the vision of one man. For a start, the plot is sourced from a great novel, itself brilliantly adapted by Nunally Johnson. That is combined with a great cast of actors and of course Greg Toland's cinematography. Ford definitely felt more at home when making a western. Having said that, he was never someone to do a sloppy job, and I'm by no means suggesting his Oscar wasn't deserved, but that's not what makes this a memorable picture.",

            "review_title": "Film about Dignity",
            "content": "The Grapes of Wrath is a 1940 film starring Henry Fonda and directed by John Ford. It is based on a novel written by John Steinbeck. The story follows the plight of the Joad family during the 1930's in Oklahoma. The family is impacted by the return of their eldest son, Tom (played by Fonda), as he returns from a stint in prison at the same time they are being evicted from their land as a result of the \"Dust Bowl\" drought and the Great Depression. The film explores the conditions and displacement that many midwestern tenant farmers endured during this period.The overarching theme of this film is dignity. Tenant farmers during this period were evicted from their land due to a long running drought and the advent of mass agriculture. The drought caused the farmers to lose income and not be able to pay the landowners. Simultaneously, the ability of machines like industrial tractors and combines decreased the value of the tenant farmer's labor. This swirl of devaluation was exacerbated by the Great Depression. The film shows how this extended to entire families being so devalued that they essentially became refugees in their own country.For example, there is a scene where the patriarch, Pa (played by Russell Simpson) enters a diner at a gas station and asks to purchase a loaf of bread for 10\u00a2. The waitress curtly replies that this is not a grocery store and they don't sell bread by the loaf. She then adds that, even if they did, they only have 15\u00a2 loaves. Pa movingly asks if he can buy 10\u00a2 of a 15\u00a2 loaf. His sincerity and dignity in that scene are apparent. He is clearly a man not asking for charity but compassion.The film's portrayal of a family struggling to maintain dignity is what makes it so timeless. Although the specific incidents may not resonate for every viewer, it is possible for anyone to empathize with a family fighting to stay together and lead meaningful lives in a chaotic environment. Also, the notion of technological advances displacing communities and tearing apart families has been seen in this country many times since the release of this film (use of robotics in manufacturing, globalization, etc). The Grapes of Wrath gives the viewer a glimpse of life in the Midwest during the 1930's. However, its timeless theme of maintaining dignity during periods of upheaval and its questioning of how society should treat workers displaced by technology make the film relevant today. The Grapes of Wrath is a film that should be seen by anyone seeking to think about these matters from a historical perspective.",

            "content": "A testament to the power of its source material and the skill of director John Ford and his able bodied cast, despite its age creeping ever closer to 100 years being in existence, black and white Great Depression set The Grapes of Wrath remains a poignant and gripping tale of one families battle to stay afloat in an unfair world, with the themes at the heart of author John Steinbeck's novel and Ford's adaptation sadly just as relevant now as they were then in a global system that doesn't make it easy for the common folk, the \"people\".Following the trials and tribulations of the Joad family as they embark on an uprooting of their lives from the dust bowl of Oklahoma to the green pastures of California after the Great Depression has decimated their farming lives and sent them on a desperate search for a chance at a new life, Wrath may not have an overall plot as such but Ford's understanding of the material his working with and care in ensuring that the Joad's feel like living and breathing creations gives his film a personal touch that will resonate with a varied collection of viewers.Centring its main attention towards Henry Fonda's recently freed from jail Tom, a man who returns to a whole new world to the one he left when first entering into prison, Wrath never settles too much around one sole protagonist as the Joad's and their close contacts get time in the spotlight as their cross country car trip to a fresh start involves run ins with the law, death/illness and above everything else hope, all documented by Ford (in an Oscar winner directional outing) and captured by some truly stunning cinematography from frequent Ford collaborator Gregg Toland.Importantly for the film, while it's unlikely many have ever experienced such hardship and overcoming as the unfortunate Joad's (to be absolutely clear Wrath is far from a jovial watching experience), the characters here and their motivations and drivers are all relatable and understandable and while there are times the narrative may enter into slightly soapy or over the top territory, for the most part Wrath feels true to the type of people it's documenting and has a carefully considered understanding of the human condition and the plight we are all on to make something of our lives.Throughout the film we as viewers are also gifted an array of memorable performances with Fonda as good as he ever was as the softly spoken but deep thinking Tom with the legendary Hollywood figure ably supported by the Oscar winning Jane Darwell as lovable motherly figure Ma Joad, John Carradine as ex-preacher turned wanderer Jim Casy and Russell Simpson as Pa Joad, giving Wrath an all-round winning ensemble that helped bring Steinback's classic words to life in a meaningful and memorable way.Final Say -A deservedly praised American classic that tackles themes and subjects that are still topical and relevant in today's climate, The Grapes of Wrath is quintessential cinema and one of the best cinematic examples of a classic piece of literature coming to life on the big screen.4 1/2 loafs of bread out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",

They have that electrifying Hollywood feel to them. Not The Grapes of Wrath however. This is a film that gives the world a reality check and tells a story dealing with the darker and more troubling side of life. It tells the story of an impoverished family moving from the Oklahoma Dust Bowl to California in hopes of finding work. However, the difficult trip takes its toll on them and when they arrive to find significantly less work than they hoped for things become even more difficult. It is the harrowing story of struggle and survival, as well as overcoming adversity with love and family, two themes that drive this film. It's an epic production to watch unfold, and it will leave you feeling so lost, so empty, and yet so amazed.It might not seem like it, but this really was what pushing the enveloped in 1940's Hollywood. To tell a story this challenging and this difficult to absorb was something rarely seen in this glimmering time period of cinema. Yet, it really gave way to revealing the impact that dark cinema can have on an audience. The bleakness of the film is what makes it absolutely gripping and endlessly compelling. It is such a harrowing story and one that constantly makes us want to know what is coming next. It strikes all the right emotional chords and plays out to be a magnificent experience. Add in incredible performances, a compelling script, and John Ford's direction and darkly moving cinematography and you've got yourself a true work of genius.By today's standards The Grapes of Wrath doesn't seem all that depressing or difficult to watch, but if you look at in context you realize the impact of the film. This is why I give this film so much praise for being a true pioneer film in the ever changing world of cinema. The Grapes of Wrath isn't fantastic enough to compel me to call in one of my personal favorites, but I have undying respect for it's quality and the important mark it left on Hollywood.",

            "content": "The Grapes of Wrath, starring Henry Fonda, is a raw depiction of the Joad family's displacement from their home and journey to find work and start a new life in California. It has been a long time since I've seen a movie that moved me the way The Grapes of Wrath did. The director, John Ford, along with cinematographer Gregg Toland used the timing of natural light to capture the raw images and create an almost documentary-like look. The actors wore no makeup to maintain the authenticity of their characters, and many scenes were shot on location in the areas the family travels through in the story. In this current era of big-budget films with stunning special effects and high-definition visuals and audio, it is refreshing to be riveted by exceptional screenplay and execution by the actors. From the beginning of the film, when Tom Joad is introduced as a man re-entering society after a stint in prison, you are transported to a time when the environment in America was rapidly changing. The great depression was in full swing, and class lines were being clearly defined, with rural Americans dropping to the bottom of the food chain. The Joad family, who for generations lived and prospered off of their land, were being forced to leave by big business and mechanized faming, leaving them with very few options for prosperity. Following a lead for employment in California, the entire family packs what they can fit into their truck and sets off on the long and dangerous journey. There is a particularly poignant scene when Mama Joad (Jane Darwell) is going through her belongings, deciding what was valuable enough to take, and what needed to be left behind, where you can feel the apprehension and sadness through the screen. That scene solidified how Jane Darwell won the best supporting actress Oscar for her role. The Joads were simple people, who worked hard and knew nothing about the world that they were being forced into. At many points along their journey, they are mistreated and judged for being rural Americans. In a scene where the family stopped at a gas station, when they pulled away, one of the attendants looked to the other attendant and said \"they ain't people.\" That line encompassed the general attitude towards families like the Joads during that time period. Not only does The Grapes of Wrath provide viewers with an illustration of life during the depression, but the movie gives the timeless lesson that hope along with the bond of family will persevere in the end.",

            "content": "What a powerful and moving story this is!  Steinbeck's novel of the harsh conditions that were faced by the migrant farm workers during the Great Depression is brought to life in a very convincing way in this movie.   What is especially good is how the victims are portrayed as real people with real faults and passions.  Tom Joad was a convicted murderer whose past crime is trivialized because he was drunk when he killed another man in a fight.  But yet, he was basically an honest man just wanting to make his way in the world without causing trouble.  The preacher is a fallen man whose sin destroyed his faith.  In the book, Grandpa was a vile and obscene man.  The mother put up with all the faults of her family as she fought to keep them together.  They were real people who were simply caught on the wrong end of the stick. Life was very hard at that time, and unfortnately the \"have nots\" were at a serious disadvantage.   Human nature being what it is, there are people of all political stripes who will take advantage of one another in the name of economic necessity. At the same time, the movie shows the real struggle of people on both sides of the problem when faced with limited resources.  One fact of life is that those who are most educated and know how to work within the system are the ones who are best able to survive.  This movie is excellent at showing the struggle of one family who is unfortunately caught up in forces that they are unable to understand and are unable to get themselves out of.  It's more than a story of \"good poor people\" versus \"bad rich people.\"  It also shows the real fears of the land owners who did what they thought they had to do to protect their rights and property from an invasion of homeless and hungry people.The person who wrote the review here saying that George Bush stole the election seemed to be writing his own \"sour grapes\" of wrath.  There was no stolen election.  His swan song about the glories of the Clinton economy ignores the fact that it was the previous administration's climate of moral decay and \"it's the economy, stupid\" policies that created the environment for all of the Enron-type corporate crimes that are just now being uncovered.   He blames the current administration for the recent recession but evidently doesn't realize that the economy had been heading for the tank during the last year of Clinton's watch; it is now coming back under Bush. \nI only mention these inconsistencies because it is tempting to view this film as a condemnation of conservative politics, when it is nothing of the sort.  The person writing that review is simply irresponsible to suggest that a George Bush presidency fosters the same conditions that caused all the suffering depicted in The Grapes of Wrath.   Democrat or Republican, it doesn't matter:  Those who own wealth will do whatever they can to keep it, while those who don't will do what they have to do within their means to get it.  Some people are just more honest than others in how they go about it. That's the human condition, and this movie depicts it in a very powerful way.Watching the movie, you can identify with the hopelessness of the Joad's circumstances.  You can also identify with the hope that no matter how badly they get pushed around by forces they can't control, they will ultimately survive.\nVery highly recommended.  IMO this is Henry Fonda's best role!",

Henry Fonda delivers what might be his best performance as Tom Joad a man struggling to get by but who eventually realizes that he is meant for greater things and that there's more to life than just helping yourself. The film is masterfully directed by John Ford and beautifully shot by cinematographer Gregg Toland. The outdoor shots are grand and bleak at the same time, bringing about a feeling of the insignificance of man compared to nature and the grand scheme of things. The lighting will go from very dark and depressing showing the characters in deep moments of suffering only for it to be broken by brightly lit moments where all seems well in the world. See this movie, that is all i have to say. Words almost fail to describe just how great this movie is",

            "content": "It's been way too long since I've read the book, and I've seen the movie now a couple of times in the past year. In a political discussion, I'd come across as the conservative, but I don't find issue here with the struggle of the Joad's to find a better life for themselves. History can't easily be defined in black and white terms, and the idea that government programs can be legitimately used to provide for citizens in dire need is to be commended. Those same programs, when used to create class warfare is where I take issue. Because director John Ford was such good friends with conservative stalwarts like John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart, one would think that he was a Republican as well. In fact, he was an activist liberal Democrat, who admired FDR and JFK. So perhaps it's true he was stirring the pot with this picture, pitting the haves against the have-nots in a way that can be viewed as left leaning. The term 'Reds' was used a couple of times by Henry Fonda in the picture in a questioning way.All that aside, \"The Grapes of Wrath\" is one of the truly great movie classics of all time. It works as story telling and as pure cinema. Ford's direction is impeccable and Gregg Toland's work with the camera is among the best in the business. The characters are perfectly cast, and even though Ford was working with a stock group of his players (Fonda, John Carradine, Ward Bond), their work in the picture transcends their personalities. For Fonda and Carradine, this has to rank right up there as among their best work. The other outstanding performance undoubtedly belongs to Jane Darwell, Best Actress for her role as Ma Joad, keeping the family together through every bad turn the road takes them.There are so many riveting scenes in the picture that it's hard to pick a favorite. But perhaps the most touching one for me was when Pa Joad takes Winfield and Ruthie into Bert's Diner while on the road. Bert orders the waitress to honor Pa's request to buy a dime's worth of bread, as Pa also contemplates a two for a penny candy purchase for the youngsters. While the truck drivers watching this exchange seem to be derisive in their observation, it's they who make good for the nickel candy. In that brief moment, Ford captures everything anyone needs to know about the good will of Man and the inherent goodness of what it means to be an American. You don't replace that with government programs, or legislate it with fancy sounding bureaucracy.",

            "content": "While the movie was still controversial for its time, it was too censored to fully convey Steinbeck's message. The movie reorganized the scenes so that instead of the Joads going from Hoovervilles to the government camp (Weed Patch) to the boxcars they went from Hoovervilles to the Ranch to the government camp (Wheat Patch). They changed the order in the movie and took the hard-hitting tragedy of the book and made it into the feel-good-movie-of-the-year. This censorship happened with many scenes in the movie. The Joads, in the book, ended by fleeing from flooding boxcars to the sanctuary of a damp barn while in the movie they leave a clean, nice government camp to go get 20 days worth of work while driving off into the sunset. The movie also completely leaves out the ending of the book where Rose of Sharon gives birth to a stillborn baby and then has to flee with some of the family to a barn to get out of the \"wet\". When they reach the barn she nurses an old man dying of malnutrition. This is a very powerful ending that was completely written out. Another major criticism I have for this movie is the lack of emotion and connection. When grandma and grandpa die in the movie, the audience feels nothing; there was no emotional connection between the audience and the characters. I also feel that by leaving out the land and by not connecting the land with the people we lose a crucial part of the story. Not once in the movie do we see a peach.The censorship of the movie destroyed Steinbeck's message. The book has a strong message of community, working together and building relationships to get through hard times. Steinbeck's way of saying this was \"I\" turning into \"we\" and if the \"we\" didn't form than everyone would fail. The movies message was that the Joads \"are the people\" and the people live on and that they were winning because they were still surviving. I do understand that if the movie wasn't censored it would never have been produced but I feel that if you cannot do a novel like The Grapes of Wrath justice then don't try.",

You just can't help but to feel for the plight of the main characters, and follow them intently as they continuously journey onward searching for hope and prosperity. In a rather grim fashion, the characters are forced to confront disappointment, and ultimately persecution and hardship at every turn.This classic John Steinbeck story is perhaps as relevant now as it was back in the 30s; it serves to criticize the ideals of the American dream, and it proves quite effective as it documents the migration of displaced farmers and workers across the nation. The story is a journey that pushes the characters to extremes, and provides a fairly hellish view of the dustbowl in general. It's driven by a constant pattern, in which the characters come close to finding what they're looking for, and then having it snatched away from them. It's pretty bleak, but the characters remain endearing, especially with their endless conviction and motivation.On film, the story is immortalized with excellent photography and editing. The acting is swell: Henry Fonda, John Carradine, and heck, just about everybody inhabit their characters quite well. The writing is superb. This production is loaded with good, real-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales. The music used is fitting.Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Perfect | Film: Very Good)",

The Grapes of Wrath is one of his finest pictures. His obsessions and political leanings come to life in Steinbeck's haunting and searing narrative.I agree with many of the other IMDB reviewers, there is much in this film that is pure leftist propaganda and that Reifenstahl and Eisenstien's influence can be seen.  This is certainly true in the masked stormtrooper bulldozer montage. But propaganda, like the very medium of film itself, operates on pure emotion. This film is loaded with one emotional image after another. The photography of Gregg Toland matches the best of Life magazine in its immediacy and realism, while at the same time dramatically recapturing the best of German Expressionism. There are so many frames that could stand as works of photographic art. The look of the film stands proudly next to the work of Benton, Hopper, O'Keefe, Capa, and Bourke-White as examples of American visual art.The cast is uniformly honest, sincere and utterly real in thier inhabitation of character. John Carradine, Russell Simpson, Jane Darwell, John Qualen and the great Charley Grapewin all give performances that are on the level with anything ever produced from a Actor's Studio graduate.Enough can not be possibly said about Henry Fonda's performance as Tom Joad. Simply put it is one of the finest characterizations ever captured on film. He was not just an American pop culture icon, he was a fine dramatic artist.The script captures much of the best of Steinbeck's novel with fantastically illuminating and human quotes. It preaches to be sure, but never at the expense of the narrative. This is a lesson so many \"serious\" film makers have yet to learn.The film has not dated in terms of its impact on the heart. Grapes of Wrath is about a specific time and place in American History yes, but it is also about what it means to be a human being. In that sense, it transcends nationalism and is fine work of World Literature. It is on equal with Citizen Kane as one of the finest films ever made. A 10 out of 10.",

Mostly stuff like The Wizard of Oz and It's a Wonderful Life that I had been weaned on from an early age. But, like most kids, I was far more into the movies of my time. I viewed most older movies, especially black & white ones, with a degree of contempt. However, that changed when I was fourteen. That summer I checked out two older movies on VHS from my local library. I had heard a lot about one of these movies being called \"the greatest movie of all time\" and the other I knew was based on a book that fourteen year-old me just wasn't about to voluntarily read (although I did read it years later). So I took them both home and watched them back to back, glued to the screen the whole time. The two films were Citizen Kane and The Grapes of Wrath and I was in love with classic movies from that point on. Interestingly enough, both films had legendary cinematographer Gregg Toland working on them.The Grapes of Wrath is a beautiful, haunting masterpiece from director John Ford, who deservedly won an Oscar. Nunnally Johnson's script brings John Steinbeck's novel to life but gives it a more optimistic finish. The cast is extraordinary, with Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell giving exemplary performances.

            "content": "John Steinbeck's \"The Grapes of Wrath\" is today very much a literary classic, but when this film came out in 1940 it was still a modern best- seller, having been published only the previous year. It tells the story of the Joad family, small tenant-farmers from Oklahoma, who lose their home and livelihood to the twin disasters of the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression of the early 1930s. Like many others in a similar situation, they head to California, which they believe to be a land of plenty and opportunity where they will be able to make a good living as agricultural workers. When they arrive there, however, they find that they have been misled. California, its population swelled by thousands of migrant workers from other parts of America, already has a surplus of labour. Unemployment is therefore high, work difficult to find, wages low even when any work is to be found, and decent accommodation unavailable.The novel was a controversial one when it first appeared, largely because of the author's left-wing political opinions, which are clearly reflected in the text. It was perhaps an unusual choice for a movie to come out of Hollywood, an institution which was far less liberal in the thirties and forties than it is today, especially as it was produced by Darryl F. Zanuck and directed by John Ford, both generally regarded as conservatives, or at least as far more conservative than Steinbeck. Zanuck did, however, have a reputation for occasionally making films with a social message- \"Gentleman's Agreement\" is another such- and the film does tone down the left-wing emphasis somewhat, removing Steinbeck's editorialising passages in which he comments directly on social conditions, and providing a happier, more optimistic ending. Nevertheless, there is still something socialist about the film, especially in the scenes set in the Government-run camp which imply that it is Big Government, not Big Business, which offers more hope to the little man. Ford and Zanuck might not have been pleased to learn that their film was twice used by America's enemies to make anti-American propaganda. During the war Dr Goebbels used extracts from it, passing them off as genuine newsreels purporting to show that America under Roosevelt was a backward, poverty-stricken land. In 1948 it had a brief release in the Soviet Union, but was hastily withdrawn when the authorities realised that Russian audiences were drawing the \"wrong\" conclusions from it, namely that in America even the poorest people could afford a car, something which in the USSR was a privilege reserved for high-ranking Party officials. Apart from drawing attention to social conditions during the Depression era, Steinbeck's book had two main themes, the relationship of man to the land and the importance of the family unit. The first of these is largely omitted from the film; it has been pointed out that, although the Joads are agricultural workers by trade, we never see them engaged in any agricultural work. The importance of the family, however, is something stressed in the film. The scenes in which the Joads' son Noah and their son-in-law Connie walk out on the family unit, while not omitted, are very much played down. The main characters in the film are Tom, the family's eldest son, and its matriarch, Ma Joad. Both can be seen as symbolic of the American people and their struggle against hardship, although the ways in which they react to their plight are rather different. When we first see Tom he is a rather wild and angry young man, just released from prison after serving four years for killing a man in a brawl. In the course of the family's journey he learns to channel his anger and resentment into a quest for social justice and becomes a committed socialist, but ironically is forced to go on the run after killing another man while trying to protect a friend. While Tom reacts with socialism, his indomitable old mother reacts with a defiant stoicism and determination not to be beaten. To her are given the last words in the film:-\"We're the people that live. They can't wipe us out, they can't lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa, cos we're the people\".Jane Darwell, at 61, was probably rather older than the character imagined by Steinbeck. (The Joads' youngest children are still of primary school age). She gives, nevertheless, a compelling performance as the tough, determined Ma, one which won her an Oscar for \"Best Supporting Actress\". Henry Fonda as Tom is equally good, but he lost out on \"Best Actor\" to James Stewart in \"The Philadelphia Story\".Darwell's was one of two Academy Awards won by the film, the other going to Ford as \"Best Director\". Ford's victory was controversial as he beat Alfred Hitchcock, whose \"Rebecca\" had taken the overall \"Best Picture\" award. Whatever the merits of that particular decision, however, \"The Grapes of Wrath\" is a fine film, and Ford's direction is one of the things that make it so. He was always a director with an eye for a striking image, something much in evidence here. His stark black-and- white photography is well suited to the film's social realism and unsparing look at the darker side of the American dream. Authors have not always been happy with film adaptations of their work, but apparently Steinbeck was delighted with this one, even though it is not always faithful to his storyline. That fact perhaps says more about the film than any critic ever could. 8/10",

            "content": "IMDb Top 250: 156I can't think of too many films that show the hardships of the Depression off the top of my head, but surely The Grapes of Wrath (what an intriguing title) weighs equally to the entirety of all others. Based on a novel I haven't read, 'Grapes' follows the Joad family leaving to find work in California with their recently returned son and finding misery. This is a heavy film, a depression in a Depression.I was excited by the prospect of seeing a John Ford film, because I associate him with two major things: beautiful cinematography and 'full' films, filled with themes and symbolism. I got the first one: dark, black and white photography, with breathtaking long shots and silhouettes, and faces appearing in darkness. The second was still there, but not as plentifully as his later films. However this is an adaptation, and thus Ford's leeway was quite constricted, plot and theme wise.A film this bleak, with such a feeling of desperation (the wind sounds are chilling) needs desperate performances, and 'Grapes' delivers. Fantastic acting. Henry Fonda is just- wow. I recently saw The Philadelphia Story, and I can say Fonda's performance is far more deserving than Stewart's Oscar winning role. Tom Joad is hot-tempered yet caring: walking the fine line between cool and volatile. Fonda perfects the role and elevates the entire film with his honest performance. He is backed up by solid support, like Ma Joad and Casy. The Joad family is large, and we don't get to really meet most of them. I'm sure the book fleshes the characters out more, but I can only remember the names of Tom, Ma, Pa, and Roseasharon (?) Joad. Like All Quiet on the Western Front, 'Grapes' teaches a solid history lesson. We see the 'Okies' plight in the Dustbowl, their trip across the country with everything in one truck, and their subsequent hardships faced in California by people who don't want them stealing jobs they need too. This story is told with good flow and a strong pace- no scene feels rushed, and no scene feels overdone.Mood is another of The Grapes of Wrath's strength. There's a very post- apocalyptic feeling about it- the scramble to ensure their families survival against everyone else. We see a form of society breakdown, where people can only fend for themselves. The major conflict is hard to describe, as everything goes wrong for the Joads. Nature, other people (but no singular antagonist) and it would even seem God wants the Joads to fail. So when the dance scene comes, it's one of the biggest sighs of relief I've experienced watching films.The Grapes of Wrath is a really bleak film with a really strong lead. It's a remarkably important film, in league with Gone With the Wind, and should be seen for that reason alone- something numbers cannot tell you. It's a story about the injustices done by the rich fat cats at the expense of the poor, and more personally a story of human resilience: that we can overcome lots, but not everything. It's certainly humbling- things can get better but they can also get worse. 8.3/10",

Or maybe one guy with a million acres and a hundred thousand farmers starving.\"Steinbeck's ode to the plight of dust bowl farmers during the Great Depression is put to film beautifully by John Ford and cinematographer Gregg Toland. You could also call it an ode to socialism, which was far less controversial a concept after the nightmarish decade of the Depression, and there are some truly stirring moments. The scene when the Joads reach a camp out of town only to find it filled with poor, displaced farmers such as themselves is haunting. Hungry children from the camp crowd around their already meager dinner, and it made me feel the weight of the question, how can you eat when you know another person is starving? The workers are so dehumanized and treated as disposable that it goes right to the heart, particularly when in many ways it's recurred 80 years later.As labor tries to organize by demanding a fair wage with up-front agreements, we see some of the usual responses from management to try to crush them: enlisting the police to arrest \"agitators,\" luring far more men out to job sites than there are jobs so they can pay less, breaking strikes with violence and by hiring scabs, and over-charging at the company-run grocery, the only one available to workers. The film is softer about this than the novel, but the film also alludes to workers who try to stand up for themselves as being labeled \"red,\" simply because they want fairness. Sound familiar? This may seem like a dusty old story but it's highly relevant today.We see the positive side of humanity in many instances of ordinary people showing a heart and helping one another throughout the film. The work is filled with religious references, e.g. the trials of the family Joad (read Job), the \"lantern\" who sacrifices himself, J.C. (Jim Casy/Jesus Christ), and the migration to the land of \"milk and honey\" - but it's in the best of ways, speaking to the need to be kind to those humbled by circumstances, and the immorality of the rich not sharing their wealth. It also mixes in elements of eastern religion, signaling the oneness of all people in lines like \"a fellow ain't got a soul of his own, just little piece of a big soul, the one big soul that belongs to everybody,\" and to me this is a highly enlightened work.Henry Fonda was very well cast for this part and does very well, particularly with the speech at the end ('I'll be there.\"). Jane Darwell also shines as his mother and has a rousing speech herself (\"We're the people.\") The stark visuals are beautiful, both in the sweeping vistas and the faces of the workers, and it's clear a lot of care went into them. The film never lags either, and I felt my heart rate was faster over its entire second half. The ending of the film is softened considerably relative to the novel, but this is a case where I love both versions. Powerful stuff.",

John Ford doesn't let us forget what it's like to be destitute as the film details the belittling attitudes they endure at every stop along the way, eating away at whatever pride they have left. And when the torturous journey claims the life of Noah Joad (Frank Sully), the eldest of the family, his haunting and memorable burial along the side of the road provides one of the film's most riveting scenes. Clear social and economic distinctions, police brutality, Red baiting, blatant injustice, and the glimmer of hope offered by the New Deal are all mixed up to make this epic saga of an American family.",

They struggled to feed their children. They had no choice but to leave their land and find a new home. Some traveled all the way across the country to find a new home. Lives were lost along the way due to illness or sickness. The darkness of the film gives you the realization of how depressing those times were. How some homes were occupied by 20 plus family members all trying to survive. The way that individuals had to suffer to get to a free land of living was gloomy situation. The part when the kids were all playing in the dumpster and then fighting to get soup was real touching and portrayed the struggle of families trying to feed their children. People lived in tents and they got used to the struggle of survival. People just wanted to work and provide for his family and they worked for pennies just to feed their children. This movie helped me to realize the little things that we take for granted today. How land could be lifted up from under people and they were left with nowhere to go.

            "content": "I had heard that 'The Grapes of Wrath' is a good movie. I watched it and I found it indeed is. It's a very well cast, written and directed film by John Ford. The movie is about a family from Oklahoma migrated to California to find work during the great depression. I don't know why we call it 'Great' depression rather than calling it 'worst' depression or 'Devil' depression. I think humans are romantic about misery and so all the brutes or incident which brought misery are called 'Great' like Alexander the devil, Napoleon the devil and Devil Depression of America (1929). I'm sure by the next century Hitler will also be termed as 'Great' as by then probably western anti-communist agenda would have subsided and people will find greatness in Hitler's policies. Anyways. Henry Fonda- a Criminal by circumstances comes back from jail on parole to his home during American economic depression only to find his land is grabbed by capitalism and his family has moved to his uncle's farm. He meets them there and as his uncle's farm is also doomed they have no choice but to move towards the west to find work. In rest of the film the whole family keeps moving from one place to the other looking for work. The film has some very moving scenes especially the one where family stops at a restaurant to buy bread. The closeness of the family members, their relationship with each other is shown beautifully. At one point I was really compelled to think they are better off as at least they are together but from the next scene onwards the family starts breaking into pieces. Staying away from the family members is a curse of capitalism and this movie has depicted it in a very formal way. People are just lost on the way. Husband leaves his wife for a job. Uncle takes a dive into the water and asks others to move on as he wants to live close to a river. How things become direction less in a money oriented society is very well done here. Jane Darwell as Ma Joad steals the show. Henry Fonda has never said a word differently in any of his film so no point in discussing what he does here.This is not a movie where you look for a story. Each and every scene is an anecdote for the people who have seen or have gone through the similar misery. It is a lesson for the future generation that the international conflict of 1914-1919 and 1939-1945 are no separate incidents. American, British and French postwar policies created global depression which resulted in unemployment and bringing communists in to power in Italy and Germany. The Great depression was a result of the First World War and a reason for the Second World War.I must admit that when characters in the film picked up the mud and called it 'my land' I did not confuse it with 'the land we confiscated from Red Indians'. I'm sure Americans found the whole 'my land' thing very moving but I have read history carefully and could not forget that the same thing happened just a hundred years back and persecuted was a persecutor then. This movie came out in 1940-the Second World War had already started by then. America was still in shambles as Great FDR of Great America had still not looted Great Churchill of Great Britain in the name of help and became a Great American President. It seems movie won two well deserved Oscars for the director and best supporting actress. This movie was a big hit and Henry Fonda became a superstar overnight. The legend goes he reluctantly signed a seven years contract with universal just because of this movie. A must watch.",

We are confronted with an economic system that suppresses downwards; nobody is held responsible. It even seems that \"nobody\" doesn't even exist.This is a story about how ordinary citizens, mainly farmers, gets affected by the big depression. We follow the Joad family who out of desperation tries to find a job in California. When they arrive at \"the promised land\" they quickly find out that life is hard to maintain. The jobs are difficult to find and when they find one the wages are an insult. Throughout the movie there is a constant battle to sustain the basic needs such as food and shelter. Despite this fight and the competition for the jobs the workers shows solidarity with each other but cannot use this to get proper organized even though a few tries (the story could be seen as a predecessor to \"In Dubious battle\" where the struggle to get the workers organized continuous).The Joad family are very poor given the circumstances but nonetheless they are looked down upon and stigmatized; being poor equals being subhuman; An Okie. If they ask questions or making a statement in front of a policeman or guard they are threatened to loose their job or getting the label \"agitator\".Only in one place do they find themselves at home; in the government camp. It is a society in its own that is a safe heaven. It is built on democratic principles and is looked upon as a threat by the big corporations who actively tries to destroy such. Democracy with it laws that regulates employer/employee relationship is a threat to maximum profit.The movie is shot in Black and white, the men are lean and the dialogue is very direct and without polite manners. You sense that the farmers doesn't talk this way because of hostility but simply because it is part of their cultural identity. The dialogue is in many cases taken right out of the book. That doesn't make it a lesser movie; it is hard if not to say impossible to compete with Steinbecks sharp pen. It may be a challenge to sense the affection in the Joad family but is there although it is not expressed overtly.In comparison the movie adaptation has a stronger focus than the more than 500 pages book had and therefore some of the characters didn't unfold enough to be understood properly. The ending is different but I think I understand the choice to let the movie finish off in a more bearable way.The part of the story where the Joads arrive at a farm full of guards, to harvest peaches scared the hell out of me in the book but not so much in the movie. It felt like the Joads where held in a combined prison/zoo and the choice they had to leave wasn't a real choice; it was a choice between annihilation or accept gruesome and absurd life conditions.The movie didn't dwell so much. It didn't stay so much with the important details that showed the reason to be desperate. How much can I get for a nickel? How much do I earn when I harvest a basket full of peaches? How much food can I buy for a day's work? Can I save money for the rainy days? Seems like boring details but to me these kind of never ceasing thoughts must have been a large part of being affected by the depression.Steinbeck writes the story with anger. You sense that he is furious; this is a piece of fiction that was needed, that had to come and thank goodness Steinbeck took it upon himself to put into words what was going on during the depression.The farmers are the 99% who tries to do what is expected of them. There is a growing sense of who the 1% are \u2013 and of course you can draw a parallel to the depression of today and the need to organize and criticize the financial system via the \"occupy wall street\" movement.Regards Simon",

Most of the existing society outside of this camp is fascist, police controlled, American Legion Nazi, exploitive and very greedy. Its a decent movie made to showcase the Depression Era effects on \" white Anglo Saxon \"American\" land owners.\" No people of black, or brown hue are in the movie. Evidently their problems did not exist. Its a classic , kind of dated ,yet relevant for today. California, the golden land, is a metaphor for the United States.

It's hard to imagine these historic events, having not gone through them and while 'Stranger Things' (2016-) and 'The Breakfast Club' (1985) were accessible to me, because I lived through the 80's, the older time periods feel like something that happened to someone else, in that awful and selfish way like \"Why should I care?\".And that's not what I mean, of course and I would obviously have cared then, but it was a struggle to recognise the family and the issues depicted here in a time 100 years ago and a place and situation that I've never been in.Even living in the current dystopian environment that I am, with a new Prime Minister every morning and energy bills higher than my pay cheque, those harsher times were really tough to associate with and the reaction seemingly so extreme.If this film was remade today and utilised all of the tricks that have been learned over those passing years and the best actors that are available, I believe that it could really emote something, but sadly, while the production values, Etc, were very good for the time and I would say that the director and editor both did their jobs well, it was \"Of it's time\".I felt detached from it in the same way I was when watching 'Ben-Hur' (1959) and 'Braveheart' (1995). It just seemed too far passed.That doesn't mean that the story wasn't interesting to watch and perversely enjoyable, because of course I didn't enjoy the pain and suffering that they all endured, but the tale was a good one and worth telling.I've never really enjoyed performances by Henry Fonda, except perhaps in 'On Golden Pond' (1981) and 'The Ox-Bow Incident' (1942) and he wasn't really that outstanding as Tom Joad. The role was very typical of many others I've seen from him, but he lead the story well along with Jane Darwell, who played his mother, Ma Joad. The others were all variously capable in their performances, some that should never have got work again and others that could have been showcased more. There were some characters that I would have liked to have seen more of, his sister, Rosasharn for instance, who I believe needed more coverage, especially as the film developed and Jim Casy, whose story might have been just as intriguing.At times I found the soundtrack was a bit jolly for the content, but I felt that the other filmic content such as the sets, locations and props, were all very apt, although the truck that they drove in scared the Bejesus out of me when there was a camber to the road.I think that this film probably features on a couple of the Top Film lists, because the story was and still is so good and maybe back in 1940 it was made the best way it could be. It really wasn't a bad film and it was well paced, but other than the story, nothing else stood out for me if I was looking to hand out awards.It was definitely a story with a lesson to be learned however, but too far in the past for me to connect with. The present is upsetting enough as it is and who knew that \"The Depression\" was so, ya know, depressing?I need more romantic comedies to watch, because this type of film is killing me with their anxieties and tensions.I would recommend it though.517.49/1000.",

Studio chief and producer Darryl Zanuck (20CF) wasted no time in buying the rights to John Steinbeck's 1939 best-selling, highly-acclaimed novel (Pulitzer / Nobel 62) that promoted people over gross profits, then picked Nunn Johnson (Three-Faces-of-Eve) to convert it to film, John Ford to direct, he finishing the 4-state shoot in about the same time (one month) it took the over-load of Joad to navigate the road to a pickers paradise by the Pacific.An indictment of the unregulated greed that led to the Great Depression and left un-educated, a farming population whose tilling techniques saw their top-soil turn to black tornado, Grapes was well received by viewers ($800k / 1.6M) and media critics, taking two prestigious Best Film awards (National-Board NY-Film-Critics) and seven Oscar nominations (Zanuck Fonda Johnson Toland Hansen Simpson), wins for its director and literal leading lady Jane Darwell (Ma) (BSA), the movie's sage and spiritual center (\"We keep a-comin!'), her soup-ladle and keepsake scenes some of filmdom's best.

And contrary to what at least one favored critic claimed (Ebert), it was not the onset of World War II which sold the mass of America on Grapes' themes in labor and freedom of interstate, its declaration of war nearly two years away, but rather, their satisfaction with six years under the New Deal, made clear by Franklin Roosevelt's landslide re-election to a second (Jan 37) of what would be four terms, a President who, had he sought divine authority, could've been made king (4/4).",

Ford's direction is assured, the Gregg Toland cinematography is stunning, and Henry Fonda is mesmerizing in what is probably his best performance. But the film just isn't all it's cracked up to be.For one thing, characters disappear with no explanation or exhibit completely unmotivated changes of heart -- as if the director's cut had been hacked to pieces by the studio after the first preview in Pasadena. Worse, in spite of the unmitigated suffering, everything has a squeaky-clean gloss, and the Joads are suffused with an unrelenting nobility that makes you want to strangle them all. Certainly Steinbeck's \"little people\" were heavily romanticized, but you could still taste the Demon Dust that engulfed them. Here it too often feels like a little wayward talcum powder.Fonda's Tom Joad is especially troubling, because he seems to exist as the mediating force between \"our\" prejudices about these people and their essential \"goodness\". He's clearly capable of violence -- and of realizing our worst fears about the poor and aimless -- but his faults are the result of an involuntary fall from grace. He's at the core an angel who's been cast from heaven by evil forces outside himself. This is rather simplistic.Still, if the film ended on Fonda's famed visionary, fevered soliloquy, it would be easy to forgive much of the gloss. Instead the last big (and seemingly tacked-on) monologue is given to Ma Joad, and its perversely buoyant optimism is utterly true to the soporific populism of Old Hollywood.",

He meets up with a former preacher, Jim Casey, and they venture out on the road. What they find is not pretty as the banks have foreclosed on countless properties and the rumor spreads that California is a perfect destination for good, high paying jobs. Unfortunately, the employers have sent out many more fliers than people needed for the work and use the oversupply to keep wages low. In order to force a living wage, attempts are made to form unions , which results in violence between starving transients living in camps and the owners who call them reds or communists.The book is one of the finest works of American literature and director John Ford retains the spirit of the novel using Henry Fonda as every man in the defining character, Tom Joad. John Carradine is also well cast as the doubting former preacher, Jim Casey. The mood is ominous but at the same time hopeful of a better time yet to come. We need to be reminded of our past mistakes in order to avoid repeating them, and this film is a good history lesson.",

            "content": "This film although made almost seventy years ago is as relevant today as it was then. It depicts a family struggling to survive the effects of a depression and trying to do the right thing in spite of enormous suffering and degradation. You could make a similar film today and probably film it anywhere in the world. There were millions starving in the world both in 1940 and now almost 2010 and without sounding too pessimistic I cannot see an end to this situation. I am not interested in politics mainly because politicians worldwide generally are not interested in changing anything for the better. Thats not to say that I don't hope for a better future but I think it unlikely that my dream of no poverty will ever come true. The situation is the same as it always was and has been the same for centuries and millions have died as a result. That is not just my particular opinion that is a fact. If you are down you will rarely get any help and indeed you are more likely to be taken advantage of because there is always someone that has the power and the lack of empathy to do that. This film graphically sets out what can happen should you and your family find yourself in a similar position. I would recommend anyone watch this film as another timeless classic. To me 'The grapes of wrath' is another warning from history, it seems we collectively are not listening.",

The performances stayed with me for years, and the power of the film too. I read the book and it showed how great a film they had made from a long, wordy, social tale. Recently re-watching the movie, it looked fresh and just as powerful as when I first saw it. Henry Fonda, John Carradine and especially Jane Darwell, give career heights performances and they add truthful weight to the characters. The story challenges the way we treat migrants and how we force them to be what we think they might be, in England we have a lot of this in recent times. All the character parts are effective, for example the caretaker of the government camp, who at last shows some understanding of the migrants problems and quietly helps them settle in. Unfortunately he is virtually the only kind soul the Joads meet on their journey. It is a solid drama, never adding any comedy or music to heighten the action, sticking truthfully to its source. I am sure Steinbeck was proud of this version.",

            "review_title": "classic narrative of the Depression dispossessed, including Exodus, with somewhat optimistic ending",
            "content": "Judging from the large number of reviews of this film, compared to most other well regarded films from this era, this must still be regarded as a classic portrayal of the plight of the rural poor during The Great Depression, dispossessed of their rented or sometimes owned land and home, forced to flee to distant overcrowded greener pastures or cities. Actually, this flight had begun around 1920, after the collapse of agriculture produce prices with the ending of WWI. Although only white Americans are depicted, African Americans were leaving southern states, especially, in large numbers during this period and subsequently. Although the Joads understandably didn't see it that way at that time, population dislocations, due to technological progress or resource exhaustion and resource discoveries is an unfortunate integral part of relatively recent history. This film dramatizes the generally greater adverse effect of such dislocations on the elderly, who have often invested near a lifetime in their dispossessed property and lifestyle, thus are more reluctant to abandon the familiar for a distant unknown, and are more likely to die trying to get there under rather primitive traveling conditions, as dramatized in this film. This particular point is more thoroughly emphasized in the subsequent film \"Wild River\", in which an elderly woman landowner refuses to leave her lifelong home and plantation, until forced to, even knowing it would soon be drowned by the rising waters behind a new TVA dam. In that case, the woman didn't die of traveling stress. Apparently, she simply willed herself to die, out of depression. She had no desire to start a new life in the TVA-financed alternative property awarded her, in spite of all the immediate and long-term benefits claimed by the TVA rep for the building of that dam.Instead of looking for work in some city, as many did, the Joads hoped to land some temporary labor jobs in the oversaturated farming lands of CA. They are put off by the primitive living conditions, thuggish guards, lack of work, very low pay, and high cost of basic supplies at the several farms owned privately. Later, they discover the more humane living conditions and friendlier attitude at a federal government-sponsored farm. This is, in effect, a plug for the New Deal projects designed, at least partly, to help alleviate much of the poverty and unemployment. The implication is that well off individuals and companies were only interested in exploiting the downtrodden, not in helping them reestablish decent living conditions. As Tom Joad, Henry Fonda, in articulating his parting ambition to act as a superman, helping the downtrodden, is really articulating some of the general goals of the New Deal and the liberal political agenda. He himself, as an accused murderer on the run and parolee, isn't likely to achieve much of what he claims he wants to do. But well-healed responsive governments could help the downtrodden in their fights against exploiting capitalists. That is the main message. Of course, in reality, this is an oversimplification. By developing new technologies and discovering new resources, private individuals and companies potentially gradually improve the living standards of their workers and consumers, with a degree of competition generally a positive influence.A few years before, Fonda had starred in \"You Only Live Once\", in which his character is paroled from a prison term for some youthful robberies, with the help of his acquired girlfriend. But, potential employers are put off by his status as a parolee, hence he can't keep a decent job, then is soon judged guilty of a large bank robbery he had nothing to do with.. Later, he accidentally kills a man during a prison break just before his scheduled execution, engineered by his girlfriend. They are later gunned down in an ambush near the Canadian border. Rather reminiscent of the historical Bonnie and Clyde, of the times. In all, a pessimistic comment on the refusal of society to ignore the past transgressions of people, especially poor people, in giving them a real opportunity to make amends. This film was made during the depths of the depression, whereas the present film, with its more optimistic ending, was made as the US was beginning to pull out of the depression, with the beginnings of producing materials relating to WWII.Jane Darwell, who plays Ma Joad, played an important role in the prior \"Ramona\", which also included Russel Simpson(Pa Joad), and John Carridine(Casy, in the present film). The plot of this film has some strong resemblances to that of the present film. but, the victims of forced evacuation of their homes and fields are Christianized California Indians, soon after CA had been wrested by the US from Mexico. Like the Joads, they packed up their minimal belongings and traveled to some unknown destination. Unlike the other, hostile, Americans, Jane's character was friendly and accommodating to these Christianized Indians. Near the end, she gives a lengthy encouraging speech, with a gist similar to her optimistic speech at the end of the present film. Thus, Jane's character is presented as sort of equivalent to the federally-sponsored farm in the present film. In contrast to the present film, \"Ramona\" was filmed in 3-strip Technicolor. B&W was probably a better choice for the present film. Another relevant film: \"Sullivan's Travels\"('41) explores the largely urban dispossessed during The Depression, and their prejudicial treatment by the legal and penal systems.....Of course, Ford soon followed the present film with the plight-of the-mining community tear jerker \"How Green Was My Valley\". Ford liked to champion the underdog, and the discriminated minorities, of which he, as an Irish Catholic, was one.",

            "review_title": "Handsome",
            "content": "Adapted from the novel by John Steinbeck, John Ford reunited with the star of his last two films in The Grapes of Wrath, the tale of a family of Okies moving from their lost sharecropping home in Oklahoma to the promise of a new life in California, only to find that reality is not the promise they had expected. Sanding down much of the more pointed political points of the source material, the end result is a very handsome, well-performed, but somewhat flagging portrait of life on the bottom rung of the Great Depression.Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) returns home from four years in the penitentiary for killing a man who had stabbed him in a bar fight. Returning, he meets the former preacher Casy (John Carradine) who tells him that everyone is emptying the area, the sharecropping farms no longer making any profit and being gobbled up by...somebody, the company. The Joads are preparing to leave as well, Tom's family having made it over to Tom's uncle's house for the final few days. Tagging along together, they collect the last of their things, lash them to the top of an old truck, and they head out west towards the promise of work for eight hundred pickers of fruit. The most notable member of the family is Ma Joad (Jane Darwell), the hearty matriarch who has to find strength to hold the unit together in the face of increasing oppression from circumstances and, later, outside forces.The odyssey to California is a hard one on the family. Grandpa Joad dies on the first night, unable to accept the loss of his home of so many decades. Grandma Joad dies the night they pass into California, providing Ma some solace in that Grandma will get buried in a place so pretty and verdant. Tom's younger sister Rose (Dorris Bowdon) is married to Connie Rivers (Eddie Quillan) who leaves the family once they reach the first camp, presumably to find work in radios like he had spoken about on the road. Most of the members of the large family are window dressing, though, the focus falling on Tom and Ma most particularly.I like the film through the odyssey to California most. It's the story of a family torn down by forces beyond their control, trying to keep it together with the promise of a new life over the horizon. I think this stuff works really well. It's when they get to California that I begin to feel a certain disconnect, like the story is finding easy villains and escapes in order to provide the cleanest possible conflict for our completely blameless and virtuous family of Okies.The first farm they get to work on is a peach farm, and the owners of the farm run it like a prison camp. People are behind fences, disallowed walking at night, and they only have use of the company store to spend their wages on, five cents for every bucket of non-bruised fruit. When Tom sneaks out and discovers Casy hidden just outside the fence with some agitators, the wayward preacher having lost his faith in God and replacing it with an amorphous faith in...the unity of man, I guess, the authorities find them. Tom kills one of the police officers after they strike and kill Casy, the scene happening in the dark to give Tom enough time to escape the setting but not before receiving a compromising cut across his face. The Joads have to flee or else Tom will be found out, and when they go they find a new camp run by the Department of Agriculture. In contrast to the hell on earth that was the place they just left, there are no gates, it's clean, everyone's happy, and they're greeted by a kindly old man Mr. Thomas (Roger Imhof) who lays out the rules of the place.All is well until the police, for reasons that are unclear, decide that they are going to take this happy little place and destroy it by staging a riot at the weekly Saturday night dance, but word gets to the inhabitants who are able to quell things before the police can arrive and get in without their warrant.It all just feels too easy. The antagonists are footmen of something larger. The nice guys are squeaky clean. It's amorphous dramatically, and I find it hard to get really involved emotionally.And yet...gosh darn it, this movie is pretty. Lensed by Gregg Toland, the man who would go on to be Orson Welles' cinematographer on Citizen Kane the next year, The Grapes of Wrath is flat out gorgeous visually. It struck me first in an early scene where Tom and Casy are asking Muley Graves (John Qualen) in the abandoned Joad house about what happened in the area. It's nighttime, and the scene is only lit by a single candle that Tom holds in front of him (knowing what little I do know about cinematography and lens aperture, I'd assume that the candle isn't the thing actually giving off the light we see but that it's enhanced by well placed and hidden electrical light sources), and it's beautiful to simply look at. There's a similar scene late in the film when Tom decides to leave to protect his family and he has to say goodbye to Ma. There are beautiful shots of the countryside with our characters right in front (they may be rear projection, but it's hard to tell because they're so well done), and the framing is always on point. Ford made a whole lot of these decisions, but it was Toland who executed them. His work made this Ford's best looking film, for sure.This is the film where Ford won his second Oscar for director (he won his first for The Informer), the film itself losing Best Picture to Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca, and I can see how the Academy would split the awards. Ford's direction is really great, the practiced hand of a master craftsman applying every cinematic trick to a story he could in order to elevate it, but Rebecca is simply the better overall film. Not that the Academy ever really thinks like this, but I get it nonetheless. The Grapes of Wrath is a movie about the message of justice for the migrant worker first and foremost by the end. The craftsmanship of the construction helps it tremendously, but I end up feeling preached to instead of entertained or enlightened. It doesn't help that sanding down the rough edges of the book's politics created a kind of mushy point in the film that's hard to discern on its own.It's respectable, really well-made, and pretty solid, but I end up feeling like it's kind of empty at the same time.",

He locates what is left of his family on his uncle's farm the day before his family is also displaced. Having heard of work in California they sell everything to buy a truck and get cash to make the trip west where they are hoping to work and earn enough to buy their own place...only they are not the only ones with this idea and when they arrive there are thousands of starving farmers vying for these migrant picking jobs, so many that the farmers are not paying a livable wage for the work being done and are in cahoots with the local sheriff's department.At times beautiful, at times difficult to watch...this film really captures a part of American history and is really worth watching.I really enjoyed the opening scene with just Fonda alone standing tall on a very flat horizon. I think Ford told a lot with the cinematography in this film. The big scene stealer has to be Ma Joad played by Jane Darwell...who really knew how to underplay a scene for maximum effect.

            "content": "(part of 30 essays I'm writing on what I consider the 30 greatest films of all time. They are written in no particular order)The film begins quietly. The time: The Depression. The setting: The Dust Bowl. The screen is filled with empty space, lonely and windy, as the camera keeps its distance from all of the characters. A man convinces a truck driver to give him a ride, even though his boss doesn't permit it. Finally we see their faces up close. The hitchhiker is Tom Joad (Henry Fonda). Some way to their destination Joad tells him he just got out of jail. The truck driver gets nervous. Joad says \"Bet your just dying to know what I was in for, well I'll tell you.\" It's his stop. As he gets off, he yells behind him \"Homicide!\" He got into a fight with a man when they were both drunk, and the other pulled a knife, and Joad killed him.This is how we are introduced to \"The Grapes of Wrath,\" a dark, lyrical and beautiful film that seems light years ahead of its time. An outspokenly socialist film, one may be surprised to find out the director, John Ford, was a republican capitalist. He did leave more of the incendiary parts from the book out, and toned down much of the original books anger, but there is still much of the same work here. The film is sad and gripping in the way it handles scenes like the one where they bury the grandfather on the way to California. His wife wants to buried with him, but they have to continue. Hundreds of miles away in California, the grandmother dies and they bury her. The sadness in this scene is underplayed, without too much weeping or excessive Hollywood-like tragedy, and it works. Death has become something these people are used to. But the depression destroys them in the way it separates them. Separation is something they are not used to, because they have lived in the same place for generations and generations.The Grapes of Wrath follows the Joads, who are kicked off their land and whose homes are destroyed like everyone else's, to make way for a huge field that will profit a wealthy landowner. Some refuse to leave. One man hides out it the fields, his family gone to California, not accepting he has to leave the land that was fought for and built by his great great grandfathers. When Joad encounters him, he is a little insane.The Joads, like many other families, get fliers advertising work for farmers in California. So the 9 of them and Casy the ex preacher (played brilliantly by John Carradine) pile into one truck which they worry could break down any minute. On the way there, they are warned at a camp from a man who received the same flier, and says they gave out twice as many fliers as they needed men, the work was taken, and if you did get it they would put you under inhuman conditions. They head on anyway and arriving they find he is more or less right. Once in, they are not allowed out, and are guarded by armed guards who tell them they will shoot them if they leave the house when its not work time. Joad escapes and finds Casy trying to organize a union. For doing so, he is shot by cops as he stands surrounded, with his hands raised. Joad helps the whole family escape.The next time they are incredibly lucky and are taken in by an FDR lookalike who treats them benevolently and kindly, and offers good pay. Just when it seems everything is going to turn out, Tom Joad's past catches up with him and he has to run away, alone. He bids farewell to Ma Joad (Jane Darwell, who won an Oscar for best supporting actress):I'll be all around in the dark - I'll be everywhere. Wherever you can look - wherever there's a fight, so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beating' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad. I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry and they know supper's ready, and when the people are eating' the stuff they raise and living' in the houses they build - I'll be there, too. So will we, Tom. So will we.",

Fonda's performances conveyed Integrity and never more appropriate than in this film. I must also praise to high heaven the work of one of Hollywood's fabled character actresses Jane Darwell. Ms. Darwell conveys more emotion in some scenes than some actresses in a lifetime. Desperation, Loneliness, Futility, Darwell encompasses all the great values that make a Mother. Jane Darwell is Mother Courageous. Fonda and Darwell's parting scene is one of the most achingly memorable scenes in film History, if one cannot share their feelings one has to be made of stone. My only critique of the film is its ending.I would have preferred one more to the book than one that the great legendary John Ford delivered.",

            "content": "The movie is set primarily in Oklahoma and California with the travel between during the Depression of the late 1930s.Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) is the eldest son of Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) and Pa Joad (Russell Simpson). He is freshly home from four years in prison for a bar fight in which he killed a man. As he nears the home where his parents share-cropped, he encounters the former preacher, Jim Casy (John Carradine), who now is a drifter trying to learn more about the reality of life.Tom finds the old home is empty and learns that the family is all at his Uncle John's (Frank Darien) home and that all the sharecroppers have been evicted by the banks since mechanized farm equipment can do their work. They have seen flyers advertising work in California and decide to go there in a rickety truck. The group also includes Grandma Joad (Zeffie Tilbury), Grandpa Joad (Charley Grapewin), Tom's younger siblings, including pregnant Rosasharn Joad Rivers (Dorris Bowdon), and her husband. They also invite Jim Casy to join them.Grandpa and Grandma die along the way as they follow Route 66 to California. They learn work is not readily available and that they are not welcome in the towns. They stop overnight at a shantytown and witness a rich landowner offering work but being coy about the wages. When one of the potential workers challenges him to put his promised wages in writing, he's called an agitator, and a local sheriff tries to arrest him. He runs, and when the sheriff tries to shoot him, Tom knocks him down, and Jim Casy gives him a kick for good measure. Jim tells Tom to run because the sheriff would recognize him, and Jim takes the rap and is arrested.The Joad family then quickly leaves when they hear townspeople plan to come and burn out the camp. Eventually, they reach the Keene Ranch, where people are milling around outside the gates. They accept work picking peaches for 5\u00a2 a pail. However, they learn some workers are striking because the owner will only pay 2 1/2\u00a2 per pail--not enough to live on. Tom takes a walk at night and finds a meeting where he learns how the system functions. Jim Casy is part of the group, as he had only been run out of town for the earlier incident. The men who are meeting hear noises of people arriving and try to escape. In the melee, Jim Casy is killed, and Tom kills the man who struck Casy. Tom suffers a cut on his face and knows he will be easily recognized.The family flees again and ends up at a relief camp operated by the U. S. government through the Department of Agriculture. Here they settle in, and Tom becomes even more engaged in social activism. One night he hears policemen taking down the license plate numbers of vehicles from Oklahoma and decides to leave to protect his family. He tells Ma Joad he wants to be like Jim Casy and become a social activist to help create a better world. The rest of the family heads to Fresno, where they have been promised 20 days of picking cotton.This is a remarkable social justice film, even though it is more optimistic than the novel it is based upon. It's almost as if the U. S. government helped to underwrite the film because of the positive portrayal of the relief camps. Still, it's a classic.",

Henry Fonda received his first nomination (Best Actor) as Tom Joad (voted AFI's #12 hero, even though his character is an ex-con that struggles to stay out of trouble during much of the story).Produced by Darryl F. Zanuck, the film was nominated for Best Picture, so was its Editing (Robert L. Simpson's only Academy recognition), Sound, and associate producer Nunnally Johnson's screenplay. It appears at #21 on AFI's Greatest Movies list, #7 on AFI's 100 Most Inspiring Movies list, and was added to the National Film Registry in 1989.The cast is chock full of recognizable character actors whose performances \u2013 along with Gregg Toland's dark cinematography \u2013 help to convey the squalid conditions of the situation and bleak outlook of the time. John Carradine plays the former preacher Casy, who makes the journey with the Joads. Charley Grapewin plays Grandpa, whose depression about his reality contributes to his failing health, while Russell Simpson plays his son and Fonda's Pa Joad.John Qualen gives the best of his prolific career as Muley, whose driven crazy by losing the land he and his family had tended for 70 years. Others in the credited cast are Dorris Bowdon, O.Z. Whitehead, Eddie Quillan, Zeffie Tilbury, Frank Sully, Frank Darien, child actor Darryl Hickman, Grant Mitchell as the caretaker of a most unusual (almost commune-like) Department of Agriculture facility, Ford company regular Ward Bond as a policeman, Selmer Jackson, Charles Middleton, Paul Guilfoyle as an agitator, Cliff Clark, Joe Sawyer, Frank Faylen, and Irving Bacon.",

But as viewers, we are cheered that Darryl Zanuck permitted John Ford and his cast to tell an important story. Although inferior, I think, to John Steinbeck's source material, arguably the greatest American novel, the film is brutally frank about terrible conditions imposed upon Americans. Gregg Toland's unsparingly bleak cinematography dominates the film; the scene in which the Joads ride into the labor camp is so unsettling that I am relieved when the camera stops panning the other residents and returns to the Joads. The unspoken resentment of the new arrivals is palpable; they are not looked upon as fellow Americans but as enemies: more people looking for work, more hungry mouths to feed. The Joads don't have much but when Ma Joad cooks something for dinner, it's as if Pa Joad can hear the rumblings of every hungry belly in the camp when he tells Ma, \"I can still see them in the tent.\"The acting is uniformly superb with Henry Fonda giving the necessary edge to Tom's character and Jane Darwell word perfect as the matriarch of the Joad family. The scene in which Ma models a pair of aged earrings in a faded mirror before leaving for California ranks with the greatest in American cinema. The first and last scenes of Ma and Tom together are guaranteed to touch one's soul. The story is too grim to support a happy ending, but what we have is about the best that can be hoped for, with Ma Joad reassuring her loved ones that \"they can't lick us because we're the family.\"",

            "review_title": "John Ford Created One of the Best American Treasures!",
            "content": "John Ford's The Grapes of Wrath is one of the best American films ever produced. Based off the literary sensation written by John Steinbeck only a year before the film's release, it tells a story about depression and poverty. It is a very simple, but well-told story with memorable characters and performances. More than eighty years later, the film remains socially prevalent today as it was back in 1940. Ford does an incredible job making his audience care about the plight of these poor folks- something that many people had to endure during the Great Depression. For the duration of the two-hour running time, I was at the edge of my seat deep within my feelings. The film is not built on shocking dramatics, but rather a story that is still striking because of how deep it is based on reality. This reality is shocking enough. On top of the actual story, Gregg Toland's black-and-white cinematography is super effective. Of course, that is how film were seen back during this time-period, but the camerawork added a realistic touch to these character's predicaments.Steinbeck's novel was a revelation when it was published. To this day, it remains probably the most social document of the twentieth century. The head of 20th Century Fox, Darryl Zanuck immediately swept up the rights for the book. But he was worried about the left-leaning politicization of the novel (keep in mind, this was a different time back in the late 30's and 40's when communist hatred was rampant). He actually sent people to see if the conditions of these \"Okies\" truly exist as the novel described. Yes, they certainly did. Still, they honed down the political overtones. In terms of the tone, the book is a bit depressing. I am happy that they gave the film a more optimistic tone and changed the ending from the book. Despite the prevalent bleakness, you cannot help but think about the word \"hope.\" Ma Joad symbolizes hope for her family as her ultimate goal is saving the family unit, which is also a slight difference when compared to the novel.This is the story about the Joad family. They are poor Oklahoma sharecroppers. Sharing the same fate as many other families during the Great Depression, this family is pushed off their lands by these wealthy landowners. Like many other Middle-America folks, they push towards California where they believe they can find plentiful opportunities to bring in the wealth. Once they arrive, they see that work is not as it seemed to be. In fact, labor unrest is very common throughout the state. Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) is the glue that holds the family together as she believes they should stay together as one unit. But her eldest son, Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) is the one who may be ultimately responsible for the well-being of this family.Excellent performances are everywhere here. Despite the film being more of a family unit when compared to the book, most of the family is relegated to background duty. When I say Ma Joad is the glue that holds her family together, I also mean Jane Darwell is the glue that holds all the actors together. She is magnificent. Her performance is raw, emotional. Henry Fonda likewise delivers a committed performance. His character is paroled from jail over a bar brawl, but Fonda plays his character as a man not committed to violence unless he has to in this unforgiving world. Also, John Carradine as Jim Casy delivers a sterling performance.The Grapes of Wrath is one of those movies that will make you think. You can compare the current labor movement to this film. This shows how the struggle stills exist even if they exist through different shapes and forms. Even the most hard-nosed person should feel some emotion when watching the plight of the family as they travel along Rt. 66 to California. John Ford is one of the best directors that tells riveting stories about America, in particular when it comes to westward expansion. Stagecoach is one of those stories that I love. This time around, Ford is telling a different type of westward expansion movie. A more raw, tender story. But unlike the novel, there is more hope here. This is one of the greatest American films of all time. A powerful story that is entirely relatable no matter the generation. It begs to be seen. So see it!My Grade: A+",

            "content": "John Steinbeck's epic novel of the poverty, dislocation, and injustices wrought by the Dust Bowl of the 1930s was unfilmable as is; it's raunchier, more political, and more left-wing than what 20th Century Fox could put in a major release. All the same, what they achieved was a masterpiece. The fraught journey of the Joads was boiled down extremely effectively by screenwriter Nunally Johnson, and John Ford's direction and Gregg Toland's superb photography are, in a word, unflinching. They're not afraid to thrust the audience straight into the suffering of the Joads and so many like them, and those hungry kids clustered around Ma Joad's pot of fried dough don't look like Hollywood extras, they look like real, poor, hungry Depression kids. The violence and capitalistic greed visited upon the Okies aren't soft-peddled, they're real and frightening. And the ending, very different from the book, is the right ending for this journey, especially in Jane Darwell's unfussy, deservedly Oscar-winning delivery. So many of the actors give career-high performances: John Carradine's haunted Casy, John Qualen's blighted Muley, Grant Mitchell's fatherly camp supervisor (the one component that feels a little soft: \"See, the government CAN do good\"). Small scenes, like the one with Mae in the diner, have large resonance, and the have- and have-not verities that are with us still have never been more realistically and heartbreakingly portrayed. \"Rebecca\" won Best Picture that year-good flick, of course, but this one's magnificent.",

            "content": "I once had the opportunity to read John Steinbeck's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \"The Grapes of Wrath\" but regrettably turned it down in favor of another novel that I was not so enthralled by. But now looking back a few hours ago on experiencing the famous film adaptation of \"The Grapes of Wrath\", I'm finding myself very eager to look upon the original text that inspired such an enthralling, potent, and strong movie.\"The Grapes of Wrath\" was directed by John Ford and stars Henry Fonda and this one of the two or three best films either of them ever made in their careers. Fonda stars as Tom Joad, an Oklahoma farmer recently released from prison during the dawn of the Great Depression. Fonda returns to his family, only to discover that they've been forced off their homes and now their only glimmer of hope for survival seems to be to head to California. But when they arrive, they arrive only to discover that things in California are just as back as they were in Oklahoma, if not worse.It has been eight decades since the crash of the stock market in 1929 and being locked in a global recession at this point in time, \"The Grapes of Wrath\" is a surprisingly potent little movie to look upon. Not to say that it wasn't always moving and powerful, but it's just that now, the strength of the movie is excelled and pulsed into the nerves of the American people.Henry Fonda was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in this movie (and ironically enough lost to his best friend, Jimmy Stewart for \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1940), an event that made Jimmy feel a little guilty afterward) and it would be forty-one years before Fonda was ever nominated for Best Actor again, when he finally won for \"On Golden Pond\" in 1981. And while any performance by an actor as multifaceted and terrific as Henry Fonda is a classic in its own right, his portrayal of Tom Joad is hands-down the cemented image of the struggling American, a performance that is rivaled in this allegorical category really only by Orson Welles in \"Citizen Kane.\" And these two performances really are the balance of what every human being wants. Welles's Charles Foster Kane has all the money and fame a man could want, but he would sacrifice it all to have a family as strong and close as Tom Joad's. And Joad watches his family crumble around him, envying men who can prosper and live happily.Now, that's just the allegory, but that's not all that makes \"The Grapes of Wrath\" a great movie. Nunnally Johnson's screenplay is arguably one of the best ever written, as it encompasses these characters and realistically recreates the Great Depression era so well to make it seem as though it were real captures images of that terrible chapter in the world's history. The movie also features a strong supporting cast including Jane Darwell, who won the Oscar for Best Actress. The cinematography is dusty, yet gorgeous at the same time and this too adheres to the psychological effect on the audience. And of course, as with any film, the director is due enormous credit. I'm not sure which film I would consider John Ford's definitive best, but this or \"The Searchers\" would be the two primary contenders.And yet, even though the movie does portray a Depression as terrible and family-wrecking, it does end on an optimistic, if not entirely victorious note for the Joad family and this is best, not finishing the story. Just giving the audience the right tone to assume and then using their imaginations and curiosity to wonder how to fill up the rest. This is a powerful, significant element of this powerful, significant film.",

            "review_title": "Overrated with flawed performances, but an overall effective adaptation of John Steinbeck's classic novel",
            "content": "John Steinbeck's novel, \"The Grapes of Wrath\", was originally published in 1939 and turned out to be both highly acclaimed and highly controversial. This film adaptation was released the year after the book and was also a success. Today, both the book and the movie are still hailed as classics. I recently finished reading the lengthy novel with the intention of watching this 1940 adaptation soon afterwards. Aware of its general reception, I was expecting a great film, better than both of the adaptations of Steinbeck's \"Of Mice and Men\" I had seen (the 1939 and 1992 versions). My expectations were definitely not exactly met. As much as I'm sure many would disagree, I don't think it lives up to the source material. I was still impressed, however.In Depression-era Oklahoma, Tom Joad has just been released from prison. He was sentenced to seven years for killing a man in a drunken brawl, but has been let out on parole after four years. On his way back to his family's farm, he meets Casy, a former preacher he used to know, who has since lost his faith. Together, they go to the Joad farm to find that it has been abandoned. Muley, a former neighbour, comes along and tells the two of them about the dust storms and how they have led to the eviction of farming families from their land! The Joads are now at Uncle John's place, and will soon be leaving for California, just like so many other farming families in the Dust Bowl are doing, including Muley's, but he refuses to leave Oklahoma. The next day, Tom and Casy go to Uncle John's farm, so Tom is reunited with his family (his parents, grandparents, siblings, and uncle). The Joads then begin their journey to California to search for employment, and take the former preacher with them on their truck. However, their destination may not be what they are expecting.Since I was expecting this to be a great film, I was expecting great acting, but unfortunately, I didn't see much of that. Henry Fonda's performance as Tom Joad is a memorable but flawed one, and this is clear from the scene where he first talks. Most of the other cast performances can probably be described the same way. Most of them aren't exactly bad, but Dorris Bowdon's performance as Rose of Sharon can be fairly poor, and the way Shirley Mills (Ruthie) says her lines can also be bad. Jane Darwell won an Oscar for the role of Ma Joad in this film, and her performance is probably better than most of the others here. There were times when I wasn't quite as moved as I felt I should have been, especially around the beginning, such as the part where Muley talks about losing his land. It just didn't seem convincing enough to me. However, I did find some parts more moving, especially later on, and found that maybe it got more intriguing after the Joads' arrival in California. For the most part, the film did hold my interest, with the story and the cinematography, though I also found that it ended too soon, leaving out too much of the novel, even though the movie is just over two hours long.After reading John Steinbeck's 1939 novel, it seemed to me that an excellent movie certainly could have been made out of it, and was convinced that this widely watched adaptation was it, but while many definitely think it is, I think it's overrated. However, overall, it is a good drama. Obviously, there are some differences between the novel and this adaptation. For much of the film, it closely follows the book (though obviously not everything is included), but takes more liberties later on. Also, some parts of the book obviously couldn't have been done in Hollywood in 1940, including the ending. This was long before the fall of Hays Code. Still, despite the differences, I would say this adaptation of \"The Grapes of Wrath\" is worth watching if you like the book (or maybe if you haven't read the book but like movies from this era), though you obviously COULD find yourself somewhat disappointed, maybe even severely disappointed, even if most people who have seen it haven't been disappointed at all.",

            "content": "John Ford directed some classics, and this might be his best. The Grapes of Wrath is of course based on John Steinbeck's seminal novel about the hardships of the Great Depression on Oklahoma sharecroppers forced to migrate to Californian for menial work. The film paints a stark picture of perhaps our country's most bleak period. A time when unemployment was around 25%, dust was choking off normally reliable farmland, and simply finding enough food to eat could be nearly impossible.This film was actually made when these kinds of conditions were still ravaging the United States. It would not be until the end of WWII that happiness on a large scale would be found once again within our borders.The film itself is skillfully made and acted. Some of the edgier elements of Steinbeck's novel could not be included in a film in 1940, but the audience will still have no trouble understanding the dire circumstances these characters face. This film basically made Henry Fonda a star, and he may have never been better. Fonda stars as Tom Joad. Joad is portrayed in the film's earlier moments as kind of a shiftless and violent type who has just been let out of jail where he had been sent for killing a man. He seems to want to brag about this to a truck driver who gives him a ride out to his family's farm. Once he gets there, he encounters a washed-up preacher named Casey who is played by John Carradine. It seems that since Tom has been away, things have gotten so bad in rural Oklahoma that even preachers are losing faith. Tom Joad then learns that his family, among several others, have been ordered off their farms by either banks or faceless corporations that own them. Tom Joad has to grow up pretty quick after meeting up with his family members, and soon enough they load themselves and their belongings into an old truck and are headed out to California to find work.The Joads encounter all sorts of hardships and prejudice on their journey, and things are even worse once they arrive in California. It seems that work is harder to find than they were led to believe, and the work there is doesn't pay worth a damn. Anyone who speaks out is likely to get beat over the head with an ax handle and killed. People are starving everywhere, and nobody in authority seems like they care. For a moment, the Joads seem to find a sanctuary in a government-run campground, but by this time, Tom Joad's fate is already pretty much determined. For reasons you will have to see for yourself, Tom Joad knows that he will have to spend the rest of his life on the run. And hopefully, he or his spirit will be able to help the \"little guy\" whenever he can. His goodbye scene with his mother is poignant, and it will touch even the most stone-hearted members of any audience.The picture looks great. B/W has never looked this good. Even though some of the sets were obviously sound stages, you won't really mind. Except maybe the scene where Fonda and Carradine are walking up the land to the Joad farm. You can actually hear their voices echo off the walls and ceiling! The film is preachy, but these were desperate times back then. To a guy who is starving and cannot feed his family, socialist dogma must have sounded pretty good. All of the performances ring true, including Jane Darwell as Tom's mother. She won an Oscar, as did director Ford. The film is bleak, but in its final frames there is a definite twinge of optimism. This is key because when the film was made, nobody yet knew of the prosperity yet to come. Pearl Harbor had not even happened. The film definitely scores points for ending with an upbeat theme and showing its faith in the people. Because after all, we the people keep on keepin' on! 10 of 10 stars.The Hound.",

At the heart of the story are a young farmer and his family who lost their property during the Great Depression.

Apart from the obvious failures at the end of the film Ford did a great job. People usually find happiness in the small things, and when these little things they lose with them is lost the meaning of life.Ideology is the journey and searching. Job, existence and life.Henry Fonda as Tom Joad is young and rebellious farmer's son who becomes so to speak organizer social unrest. His knowledge of the link between the two classes. He committed two murders, but finally knows that his enemy is not the people but an ideology.Jane Darwell as Ma Joad It is a pillar of the family and probably the most powerful character in the film. In the most difficult situations, trying to keep the family together, although this is impossible. Women and mothers are adjusted when living and when survives.John Carradine as Jim Casy He a key character. A good man and a former priest who does not know, but he's trying to learn.

I find it difficult to match actors with the characters in the book however, Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, the hot head. Fonda did a great job of portraying his character as the common man and his performance allowed me to understand the way many individuals were feeling during that period of history. While the movie did leave out many important scenes that were included in the book the scenes included showed the struggles of the Americans that experienced the Dust Bowl. The scene where the Joad family is kicked off their land was quite emotional and a good depiction of the past. The setting of the film was very accurate to the book and the way the scenes were The shot of the family traveling to California were very well done.

There is no explanation of what happened to him.The last time we saw him was when he was swimming in the Colorado river on the border of Arizona and California.Even the writer, John Steinbeck, almost left him out. He was far along in the book when he was questioned about Noah.

I like intellectual dramas, but not if they're melodramatic, and a film about an event they name after \"Depression\" I was sure was going to be too weepy. This is why I still haven't seen Schindler's List. I just haven't had a free week where I can afford to cry all the time.Also, a lot of \"classics\" are pretty boring, not from an film school perspective, but from a regular guy perspective. So I'm glad to say that The Grapes of Wrath is a winner. It starts with a lot of whining about land, which as I've moved several times in my life I didn't quite get, but when it ratchets up into labor camps and competitive gangs fighting for jobs, holey smokes.It's true that the film is preachy. But it's also a true story, and good one. The point of the film isn't so much the plot as the settings that the family is thrust into. And it's wonderfully moving. Similar to Across the Universe, you get a glimpse into all aspects of life in that period.I recommend it as a classic that's not too erudite or aging. I'll give The Grapes of Wrath an 8 out of 10, sort of a bonus 7 out of 10 for being a true story.",

The Joad's struggle is hauntingly foreshadowed at the beginning in the Joad's abandoned house, where a mood of tragedy is established. Throughout the film, use of deep contrast and shadow is appropriately used to emphasize moments of despair and sullenness, the preacher often comes in and out of shadow and plays a key role in Tom Joad's development. I found the mother to be exceptionally engaging, owning most of the emotional power and meaning in the dialogue. While the film is mainly a constant bludgeoning of sadness, and it feels as though the Joad's will never be at peace, there are moments of relief. The grandpa serves a dose of comic relief, and the government run housing camp is the only place happiness seems to exist. Over the course of the film you begin to feel connected to the Joads, and start thinking like them. As the Joad's enter the displaced farmers' camp, you feel a sense of apprehension along with Tom, and you find yourself waiting for the next injustice to present itself. You then grow attached to this haven, and feel accomplished when the police scheme against it is thwarted. The beautiful photography, top tier dialogue, and moving story all blend to produce an engaging style typical of great movies; a category in which this film rightly fits.",

            "content": "As a film of the 1940's, The Grapes of Wrath does a wonderful thing.  It shows us humanity in only the way that someone like John Ford could show it. Primarily known as a director of westerns, Ford helms this project with all the love and care you'd expect from someone entrusted with such a great and monumental classic work of American Literature as this is.Even seen as a bit dated by today's standards, this film harkens back to a time in American History when the Government was literally throwing people off their land just so they (the government) could have more and more room for argriculture and farming purposes.  So, the Joad family like millions of other families in the midst of the Great Depression flees westward to California.  They do this simply because they believe that work, not to mention a better life will be found there.  However, once they arrive in California the Joads begin to see just how wrong they were with so many of their assumptions.This has to be the defintive Henry Fonda performance.  Fonda plays Tom Joad with sort of an everyman type of quality.  However, Fonda lost the Best Actor Oscar to James Stewart in The Philadelphia Story.  The Grapes of Wrath recieved two statuettes that year, Best Supporting Actress for Jane Darwell's iconic portrayal of Ma Joad, the undeviating strength at the core of the Joad clan and Best Director for John Ford (his second Oscar after 1935's The Informer).  The Grapes of Wrath was also nominated in the categories of Best Original Screenplay, Best Film Editing and Best Sound Recording, losing in all three instances.  The film lost Best Picture to Alfred Hitchcock's suspense masterpiece Rebecca.All in all, this is an important piece in a director's legacy of great films.  John Ford would follow The Grapes of Wrath with 1941's Best Picture winner How Green Was My Valley (another Best Director statuette) and his 1952 homage to his homeland of Ireland, The Quiet Man (yet another Best Director statuette).  But his film career would be crowned later still with what many consider his greatest achievement, 1956's The Searchers with John Wayne, Natalie Wood and Ward Bond.My rating: 2 and a half stars",

            "content": "Some books are meant to be left as literature. They can't make the transition to film. I thought the 1984 release of Orwell's classic did make the jump brilliantly but it's rare. Here we have a beautiful\nmovie that captures much of the spirit of Steinbeck's work but it isn't valid to compare them, though inevitable. Steinbeck is probably my favorite author. The pictures his writing puts in my head are very different then those the movie forces on me, which is almost always the case. I mentioned '1984' because the visions were similar.There is no getting around the wonderful performances and 'zeitgeist' captured in this lovingly made work of art, the movie I mean. It almost obligates you to read Steinbeck if you haven't. I have read almost everything he's done. I love Cannery Row and Tortilla flats and Dubious battle, Of Mice and Men and The Pearl and on and on...... and oddly, East of Eden, meant the least to me.......but they all form one giant book to me, and as rooted as they are in time and place, his message seems more about humanity and kindness and cruelty, then the historicity in which the human forces play out.I have nothing to say that isn't likely gone over in the many comments. This is without doubt one of the timeless great motion pictures of our world. Steinbeck got his Nobel Prize at a time when you had to do something like discover atomic energy to get one, instead of the political joke it's become. The movie does honor to the text. A great feature of the book, as is almost always the case in literary art, particularly where the author has a message that means more then the tools of its conveyance, is that you stop noticing the words. Words are just the tools, the symbols that convey ideas and images, and Steinbeck never tries to impress like DeLillo or McCartney with massive vocabulary. You barely notice the flow of words...they are just the tools to convey the essence of his message, not a way to impress you like a masturbatory rock guitarist using 1000 notes when 3 would suffice.The imposed brevity of the movie makes it even more important to convey the message efficiently. And it is surely a success.",

All the performances are stellar, obviously to include Henry Fonda's Oscar nominated performance as the films main character, Tom Joad. While I have never read Steinbeck's novel of the same title, after viewing this film i will certainly put it on my to do list. This film seems, almost effortlessly, to perfectly capture and showcase the harsh conditions of the 1930's during the dust-bowl. Many aspects of this film were extremely well done and worth mentioning. The outstanding performances of the actors aside, the scenery, story telling, and overall misc-en-sene of the film is great. At no point did this film fail to keep my interest, as the characters in the story, although clearly in no way similar to my personal life's story, are truly relate able to the audience. As a viewer, you feel for the plight of the Joad family on their endless journey just to find work and some small semblance of creature comfort. Additionally, the harsh and severe treatment that the travelers as a whole experience at the hands of both law enforcement and local farm security made me nothing short of incensed. To be sure, during the scene in which Tom's friend is killed on the river, I found myself almost in shock, for I did not in any way see that action on the horizon. However, I think it , the killing and general treatment of the migrants that is, stands as a testament to what life must have truly been like at that dark time in American history. Furthermore, the fact that such blatantly gross abuse of power was allowed to persist speaks volumes to the wanton disregard that so many must have had for those that were unemployed. This is truly sad when you think about it; Most of the families that were traveling hundreds upon hundreds of miles at the cost of even further famine and illness only wanted work and some food to eat, and were met with admonishment and disregard. That is truly appalling. But I digress. The Grapes of Wrath is an excellent film that in its time served as a call to action for all those who wished to take a stand against the abuse and mistreatment of others. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and would recommend it to others wishing to glean some knowledge about a oft-forgot time in American History.",

            "content": "\"The Grapes of Wrath\" is considered one of the top pieces of cinema to ever be created, and even when viewed for the first time 80 years later, it's not hard to tell why. In the movie based on the book by John Steinbeck, we see the reality of what many American people faced. Tom Joad, played by Henry Fonda, is a wayward man, on his way home from prison to reunite with his family. Once home, he discovers that his family has been pushed out of their home by the people who own the land. The family, reunited with Tom decide that they can persevere and will relocate to California, where jobs will be plentiful, and money and housing will not be an issue. They decide to take Jim Casy (played by John Carradine), the old ex-preacher, along for the journey with them.\nThe Joad Family along with Jim Casy quickly discover that the American dream they were hoping for was not as easily attainable as they previously hoped. It seems that they are struck with hardship after hardship, beginning with the death of multiple family members during their journey just travelling, followed by lack of jobs, lack of food, questionable living conditions, and unfair treatment by employers. In one particularly shocking scene, Connie, father-to-be of Tom's nephew, runs away from the family, unable to deal with the pressures of the working camps, leaving his pregnant wife behind.\nIt seems as if the Joad family's misfortunes will never end. At one of the camps, ex-preacher Jim Casy finds himself involved in what is most likely the beginning formations of a union. Workers are forming strikes to protest the unfair monopoly the food store has over the workers of the farm. Both Jim and Tom find themselves amidst the strikers on one fateful night at which point Jim is struck dead by an officer. Tom retaliates back by killing the officer and running away, but not before getting struck in the face himself, leaving him with an identifiable scar. As the police begin their search for Tom, the Joad family decides to try again, and they pack up in search of the next camp.\nAt the final camp, it seems that the Joad family's misfortune may be over. Government run, there is plenty of work, food, showers, and even dances. It seems that everything may just work out for the Joad's until the police eventually come by looking for Tom, who has violated his parole by killing the officer at the previous camp. Tom decides it will be best to leave his family permanently to avoid them getting in trouble for hiding them. In a touching scene, Tom says his final goodbyes to his mother and reflects on his time with Jim Casy, the ex-pastor, deciding that he would like to follow in his footsteps and seek out some form of social justice. The two bid goodbye and the next day, Ma (played by Jane Darwell) heads out to work with Pa and delivers perhaps one of the best executed speeches in the whole film, discussing how despite the trials and tribulations the family has faced, they keep surviving and will continue to survive no matter what.\nUltimately, it is the movie's telling of the story, produced by Nunnally Johnson, that makes the movie resonate as strongly as it does. Though perhaps the acting seems a little over the top years later and the accents were hard to follow and understand, the ultimate portrayal of resilience that makes Americans American is a message that still instills a sense of pride in anyone who views this movie. Overall, I would give this movie a solid 8 or 9 out of 10. It is certainly easy to understand how and why this is still an ultimate classic of American Cinema.",

            "review_title": "A drama about the expulsion of peasants from their tenant farm",
            "content": "The Grapes of Wrath is an exceptional film, both in substance and as an artistic accomplishment. Since I did not read the book, my review is written without any prejudice. In the film we follow an extended family of small peasants, the Joads, who are expelled from their tenant farm. At first the story may seem a typical part of American history, which is of course true. For instance the illustrious folk singer Woody Guthrie had his roots in the Oklahoma dust bowl, and the eventual migration to California. I was truly fascinated by his biographic DVD \"This machine kills fascists\". But in fact the expulsion of small peasants is a universal theme. Already in the fifteenth century it started with the English enclosure movement. In the nineteenth century it was a recurring phenomenon in all parts of Europe. For instance, in 1903 the Flemish author Cyriel Buysse wrote a play about it (\"Het gezin van Paemel\"), and created one of the predecessors of Steinbeck's novel. Later a Flemish film version has been produced, which is highly recommendable. And then in the Bolshewist countries there was the forced transformation into collective farming. Although the Czechoslovak and Polish regimes shrunk from this move, which gives food for reflection. The making public of the American version through a book and subsequently a film was a courageous endeavor, since social critique is rarely welcomed (it could probably only be done because of the friendly New Deal atmosphere). Paricularly striking is the scene, where a farmer tries to prevent the demolition of his farm by threatening with a rifle. He asks the usher: \"Against who should I defend myself?\" The land owner? No, it is only an enterprise. The director of the enterprise? No, he just does what he is told to do. The bank? No, it simply reacts to the demand of the market. Of course the usher puts up a sham, because each and every one of these institutions is to blame (evidently in the first place the director, who has made a willful decision to break up the long-lasting business relation). The homeless farmers migrate en bloc to California (!), hoping to make a living as pickers. They live in tent camps, and are murdered by villagers, the thugs of land owners, and even the local police (especially the deputies are accomplices of the wealthy land owners). The main character is the peasants son Tom Joad (impressively portrayed by Henry Fonda). He has just served six years in prison for man slaughter, and is freed on parole. Here we see a glimpse of the family pride. When Tom returns home to Oklahoma, his family assumes: \"Did you escape?\" Especially grandfather is delighted: \"I told you so! They can't lock up a Joad!\" He and many others hold that they have a right to the Oklahoma land, because many of them died there: \"It is our dust\". All peasant communities share this same common isolation, caused by an apparent independence and self-provision (my grandparents were also farmers). This tends to make them inflexible. Grandpa and Grandma die during the ride to California. This does not come as a surprise, and therefore the Stalin-like director of the land owning company does not go free here. Characteristic of the small and collective peasant world is the mother of the family, who complains that she sees her family falling apart. Again Tom kills a man, this time not in self-defense. Frankly, I don't understand this aspect of the narrative. On the one side, Tom is no more a criminal than the policeman, who for no reason fires with his gun in a crowded camp of migrants and seriously wounds an innocent woman. On the other hand, it impedes the feelings of empathy and identification of the viewer/reader, and images the Joads as culpable wrong-doers. As a matter of fact, it can be argued that the Joad family (just like the Paemels) have neglected the change of time,and the agricultural revolution. This is a central point. Too often the changing policy of the society elite is far-reaching to such an extent, that the common people get no fair chance to adapt. And this can truly be called a crime. In conclusion: The Grapes of Wrath is recommended (which it doesn't need). If you like social films, see Het gezin van Paemel. Or consider reading my other reviews.",

            "content": "Growing up in a comfortable suburban community, I had the option of reading John Steinbeck's \"Grapes of Wrath\" in an English class. I wish I had. But I'm not sure I would have fully grasped its significance. Now that America is in a modern equivalent of the Great Depression, some 80 years later, I can fully appreciate Steinbeck's work. I have nothing against capitalism, but what is portrayed here is not capitalism, it is naked, ruthless greed destroying the lives of countless people. While the details have changed, the greed we see today is the same, and even more faceless and insatiable. This movie is not just a story, it is a lesson about the need for compassion for our fellow Americans and human beings, a lesson that desperately needs retelling today. In 1960, John Steinbeck traveled around America in a pickup camper to research the book that became \"Travels with Charlie.\" The Steinbeck who saw the horrors of migrant labor camps portrayed in \"Grapes of Wrath\" did not like what he saw Americans had become in 1960, especially the racist \"cheerleaders\" of New Orleans. He was so demoralized he eventually cut his trip short and headed for home. I wonder what Steinbeck would have thought about Americans today, especially the politics? I think John Steinbeck would weep.This is a movie that every American should watch, especially if you are living in a comfortable suburb insulated from the pain many of your fellow Americans are experiencing today. This is not a comfortable story, but it is one you need to see, and probably will be glad you did see, unless you are one of the 21st century robber barons.",

I've seen a lot of old movies and this one certainly stands out as being unique. It's gritty and focuses on characters who belong to the lowest classes. As soon as I saw the scene with a farm run by the US Government, I knew there was a political message being made. The message was clearly that capitalistic farm owners only seek to exploit their workers, whereas the government is more like the workers' friend and ally. Was this the reality and big picture taking place in the 1930s? I don't have a clue. I suspect the real truth is far more complex. It would be interesting to see how proponents of the current Critical Race Theory would view this movie, since all the exploitation shown is due to socioeconomic class and not race. All the characters were white. It was all about white people being cruel and exploitative towards other white people. Performances were credible although at times the script and direction were too \"theatrical\", veering from stark realism to performance directed at an audience. Very bleak and somewhat depressing social commentary, but worth seeing once.",

He returns to the farm in the Dust Bowl era only to find everyone packed up and gone, part of a mass migration to California where supposedly plenty of farm jobs exist for them. Tom catches up with his family before the authorities come to demolish the home where they're staying[1] and about ten of them head west in a big ol' beat up truck that reminds you of the Beverly Hillbillies.The story is how human beings, when faced with natural disaster and social structures that systematically destroy their ability to earn a living, press on with dignity and hope.

            "content": "This is one of the most watchable old films I've ever seen, right up with \"Citizen Kane\" and \"12 Angry Men.\" Direction, Photography, and acting all shine. The story is a little weak, as there's simply no way to provide all the rich characterization and settings that Steinbeck does in his novel. Because of that, the movie felt a little jumpy to me, but all in all it is one of the best adaptations I have seen. Of course, the ending is inadvisedly changed, but I don't think it's reasonable to expect a Hollywood film from the 40s to end with a stillborn baby and a woman breastfeeding a grown man, no matter how symbolic the imagery is meant to be.I have two complaints relating to discrepancies between the book and the movie. The first, as other reviewers have mentioned, is the total lack of explanation involving the disappearance of brother Noah. This left me very confused: in one scene, he is bathing with them in the river, and 2 scenes later they are down to \"4 men.\" This strikes me as either an editing or scriptwriting problem, and one of the only flaws I noticed in the film. The other problem I had, which is strictly personal of course, is that Fonda's \"Tom Joad\" came across as more confrontational than he seemed in the book. This is evident in the first scene with the trucker, and later on the porch at the $.50 campsite. My vision of Tom Joad after reading the book was a more softspoken man, not as likely to confront someone directly but certainly not willing to back down once disrespected. Let me be clear in saying that I still think his performance was fantastic.All in all, I would have liked to have seen maybe 20-30 minutes more of character development or plot points (from the novel) added, but that is just coming from someone who was blown away by the book, so take it for what it's worth.I would also like to address those who object to the movie on political grounds, saying it's pro-communism, or that it's an exaggerated account of the Dust Bowl. It's well-known that Steinbeck was a Socialist bordering on Communist for at least this period of his life, so it makes sense that he would write a book lambasting unfettered capitalism and progress. Whether you are socialist or capitalist is really beside the point on an IMDb forum. I wouldn't even be surprised if he exaggerated events to further his point. But I maintain that none of these facts, if true, detracts from his theme of disadvantaged people maintaining hope and preserving their dignity in the face of injustice.",

            "content": "The Grapes of Wrath is a 1940 Hollywood movie and is based on the book written by John Steinbeck. It was adapted for the film by Nunnally Johnson and directed by John Ford.\nThe film's main focus is on the Joad family's survival during the great depression of the 1930s. The film is in black and white which lends itself ideally to reflect the gloomy times and life circumstances of the main characters; they are poor tenant farmers, suffering from terrible climate catastrophe that destroyed their land and livelihood. The process of brutal bank repossession of the farm and eviction of inhabitants was presented in its entire cruelty, showing no regard for the dignity and destiny of its long-term occupants and their survival.\nThe film opens with the two main characters: Tommy Joad (played by Henry Fonda), and Jim Casy, a preacher and Tommy's friend, driving by some fields and talking about share cropping. Tommy discloses that he has been just paroled from prison where he spent 4 years for killing a man at a bar. That later puts him in a legally sensitive position. Returning to the share cropping land in Oklahoma where Tommy Joad and his family had worked for generations, he was immediately told that they are no longer allowed to work on those lands. After much effort to resist, the Joads join the caravan of other from Oklahoma on the journey west to California that advertised jobs and opportunities. That made them feel hopeful for their future.\nThe film follows their journey to California, where not everything is great: some family members die and some lose their spirit in addition to their descent into poverty, some split from the group, people quarrel and fight, the living conditions are horrible, people sharing sad stories of helplessness, low pay and more hopelessness. Jim Casy is very honest about losing his faith while still reminiscing fondly on his past time as a preacher. Both Jim and Tom reflect passionately on the conditions, the fairness and social justice.\nThe tragedy of this film is watching their long trek not result in a better life. Still the film includes scenes where people manage to dance and sing and cling to hope and stay loyal to land and farming.\nWhat I really liked about this movie is that it made me consider parallels of poor living conditions of people under capitalism versus the powerlessness of masses of people under communism. In spite of sad circumstances people in the movie were free to move and pursue happiness. Compared to the amalgamation of modern movies I've seen the characters were very authentic and much easier to connect with.\nThe movie was one of the best overall that I've seen. The absence of CGI was also surprisingly refreshing because it makes you just focus on the people, the acting and the story. I haven't seen any other films from this era which makes me not want to give it any kind of star rating.",

The Grapes of Wrath is more than just a good old fashioned movie; it's a lesson in American history. Many of us have probably heard a grandparent or older family member talk of \"The Dust Bowl\" days, \"The Depression Era\" and of banks foreclosing on farms during the 1930's. Director John Ford brilliantly captures all this in The Grapes of Wrath as it follows one Oklahoma family through all these hardships as they migrate from their foreclosed farm to California in hopes of finding work in a depressed economy. Superb acting by Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell and John Carradine bring raw emotion to a well written script based on the novel by John Steinbeck. Both the novel and the movie were extremely controversial during their initial period of release.

After more than eighty years this solid adaptation of John Steinbeck's masterpiece has lost none of its potency, serving as a document of the devastation wreaked by the Great Depression. The visuals provided Ford and cinematographer Gregg Toland have the stark power of a Walker Evans photograph.From the moment Steinbeck's novel was published, Twentieth Century Fox honcho Darryl Zanuck wanted to make a motion picture out of it. But he had to tread carefully to avoid the wrath of the big bankers, whom Steinbeck portrayed very negatively. To keep the project as hush-hush as possible until ready for release, production on THE GRAPES OF WRATH proceeded under an alternate title. Zanuck also sent men out to the California agricultural fields depicted by Steinbeck to make sure the author wasn't embellishing the exploitations against the migrants. He was quite stunned to learn that, if anything, Steinbeck downplayed their experiences, that it was much worse.THE GRAPES OF WRATH also afforded Zanuck the opportunity to sign two independent minded talents who were reluctant to be tied down by a contract. John Ford was a maverick director who cherished his artistic freedom but he also knew how to play the game in Hollywood. He already won an Oscar for THE INFORMER, and by the time of THE GRAPES OF WRATH, Ford was enjoying a hat trick with STAGECOACH, DRUMS ALONG THE MOHAWK, and YOUNG MR LINCOLN in 1939.Ford's leading actor on the latter two films was Henry Fonda, a man who also managed to freelance in an era where that was very uncommon. When he was filming JEZEBEL at Warners, Fonda had a clause in his contract allowing him to leave the set for New York to be present when his baby daughter Jane was born. Knowing how important THE GRAPES OF WRATH was to both men, Zanuck used the material to issue take-it-or-leave-it offers to entice Ford and Fonda over to Fox. Ultimately, both of them signed along the dotted lines.",

Homeless and out of work, they had to move to the extreme west (State of California) to have a chance of earning livelihood and survival. They move from Okhlahoma to California in a vehicle that is old enough to be kept in the museum. Their journey to California itself is a highlight of the movie. They venture through different towns and states, get the sometimes good and sometimes bad reception of local people of every state, Hell,loose two members of their family in the journey (The Journey in Little Miss Sunshine is inspired from this movie). Living peacefully all these years in their Oklahoma Farm, suddenly they are faced with the materialistic facet of human nature. Some days they go without eating, somedays without sleep, Looking here and there for a job, they are ready to do absolutely anything. In all this trauma and pain, the only thing that remains constant is the human emotion of love and belonging. As a family, they are emotionally richer than the most richest man around. The clear message given in this movie above all is the importance of a family and the attachment to it is the only constant thing in life.Performances are absolutely top notch. Henry Fonda gives a great all-round performance which can be considered one of his best ever. From the family, the one that impresses the most is the family Matriarch played by Jane Darwell who is responsible actually for binding the family. Actresses in the black and white era normally over-dramatized or in short over-acted especially in movies as these. But her's is a very natural performance. Overall, this movie may not appeal to people who don't have the basic human emotions of love, belonging, grief etc. I am not of that kind and thus I thoroughly liked the movie.Rating : 8/10",

He says that he got direction from his company; his company got direction from the bank in Tulsa; the banker in Tulsa got direction from the bank headquarters of the East, who makes all decisions to earn money most efficiently. This is the same with what is happening in today's world. Today, the greedy economic animals in the East of America are doing the same, and by their greedy acts the world is going to big depression. Therefore I felt this movie still has a strength that works today.Though I have not read the book yet, there were some scenes I could not understand well. Kasy was an ex-preacher. He did not know about the economic social problems of the poor and the rich. He is arrested at the camp site to let Tom run away. It seems only few days later when Kasy was in a tent of strikers and he knows the tricks of capitalists. And Tom is deeply moved with Kasy's insight. How come did Kasy get such insight that shortly?",

The negative element was that most of the sequences didn't have a strong substance. The black and white footage aggravated the situation; the reason was that the storyline was crumbling like breadcrumbs. As a consequence I lost fascination in the plot. Because of the terrible director the landscapes were matt with the colour. If it was Hitchcock motion picture the Black and White and the directing wouldn't of been an issue. In my opinion the soundtrack was rushing to the drains because of the instruments that were playing worthless chords. But on the other hand some of the camera angles captured quality moments for an example; far distance and sky view. The phycological element in the content was underneath the surface as John Ford's purpose. A few scenes of cinematography were impressive. I give John Ford's motion picture a 2 \u00bd /10",

I can't imagine why theatergoers would have wanted to see such a bleak, depressing movie during such a bleak, depressing period in American history. Audiences like to escape for a few hours and be entertained and uplifted when times are bad, not depressed further. The words and speeches in the book and the film are nice, but words don't fill the stomach or pay the rent. Idealism only goes so far and \"the little guy\" rarely comes out ahead and that's a long-established fact.",

            "content": "The Grapes of Wrath is a must watch film due to its parallels to The Dust Bowl and The Great Depression of the 1930's. The movie also portrays thoughtful cinematography and excellent choice of music which brings the whole movie together. A major theme in the movie is the Dust Bowl. The Dust Bowl was a series of major winds and drought during the 1930's that spread throughout the southern US which led to the death of all crops and livestock. The main characters of the movie, the Joad family loses their farm to the Dust Bowl and travel from Oklahoma to California in an attempt to rebuild their lives. They encounter many struggles along the way and have little money due to their crops being demolished from the unforgiving winds. In 1929 the worst economic downturn in US history hit, the Great Depression. It began when the stock market crashed and immediately impacted the rest of the US. During this time unemployment rose to 25% and many people lost their houses, cars, jobs, etc. This major economic downfall is portrayed so vividly in the movie when you see the characters struggle to find a job to make enough money to provide for one another. The American dream portrayed during the roaring 20's is now gone and reality has set in for the characters knowing they may not make enough money to live. As well as it's significant connections to history The Grapes of Wrath also should be recognized for its flawless cinematography and music score. Director John Ford uses storytelling through the cinematography of this movie with subtle hints shown in every shot. During the scene where the caterpillar passes over Muley's house the cinematographer slightly pans to show the shadows of the farmers going through the tractor tracks. The use of the shadows portrays an underlying theme of defeat coming from the farmers, only putting the shadows in the shot left a feeling of emptiness in the viewer, exactly what the farmers were thinking in the scene. The music in this movie compliments the theme almost perfectly, with songs such as \"She'll Be Coming 'Round The Mountain\", and \"Going Down The Road Feeling Bad\" Alfred Newman does an incredible job of placing the music within the movie. The entire soundtrack of the movie fits perfectly with the theme of hopelessness and traveling West which enhances the entire experience of the movie. This films tie ins with major historical events and incredible cinematography and soundtrack make it a must see for anyone.",

This was what opened up John Ford's black and white, seven award nominated film The Grapes of Wrath.The Grapes of Wrath (1940), John Ford's greatest film also in black and white was about the Joad's family from Oklahoma, Colorado who were evicted from their dirt bowl ancestry land. They migrated to California in search of jobs and to find a better way of life. Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) played a major role as mother of the Joad's family in the film. Ma Joad is a strong willed mother who always encourages the others to be positive and strong=g. She was the backbone of the family. She kept the family together throughout the migration and through the roughest times.It was a pleasure watching Ma Joad take care of her family and providing them with the love and support needed to motivate and comfort each family member even when they were dying. During their migration Ma Joad lost two of her family members. Ma Joad fulfills every expectation playing her part in the film.Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) played his role exceptionally well as the black sheep in the family. Tom who just got out of jail for committing homicide was released early on parole. He was very excited to see his family only to be told that his family and his neighbors were evicted from their ancestral home. He soon found them and joined them on the trip to California. Although he was very short tempered, and on parole he tried not to get into trouble because his mother has begged him not to get into anymore trouble. Tom played his part amazingly well in this film.The film settings in black and white along with natural and low key lighting made this film exceptional. Everything looked so real, I felt as if I was character in the film. It felt like everything was happening while I was watching it. It all seemed so natural with the sunlight during the day and the low source of light in the night. This was the best black and white film I have ever seen. All the shots that made up the scene of the camp grounds were excellent. The high angle camera shot that was taken of Tom hiding when they were looking at license plates at the camp grounds was a great shot. This showed me how vulnerable and hopeless Tom was after killing a cop after they killed Casey.While migrating to California I noticed there were a lot of informational signs. Most of these signs would say welcome to Arizona or welcome to California. These signs gave only a part of the information, they would then say the speed limit is, but the speed limits were never shown in the film. This family knew there were no limits to what they could do.The Danger sign posted on a tree at the end of the film reveals that they were coming out of harm's way and that everything was going to be alright. This film far exceeded my expectations. All the characters played their part very well.",

            "content": "\"We'll go on forever, Pa, 'cause we're the people.\" The Grapes of Wrath (1940), based off of John Steinbeck's epic novel, is, for me, director John Ford's most famous black and white epic drama that truly indicates the struggles to survive and the ultimate will to go on amidst a bleak and weary world. Do the Joads give up all hope or continue to pursue their dreams during the one of the most flavorless times in American history? Let's take a look. The film itself has many great points that I would like to point out, and also not some very good ones at that. A great moment in the film is in the beginning when Tom (Henry Fonda) comes back home only to dins it darkened and dim, and how the lighting appears on his face, which shows almost all of the left side of his face black and white only a little sliver of light displays his right. To me this implied that even though the darkness had come, a little glimmer of hope still remained with him. The acting was great, but it was really Tom and Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) that captivated me by their amazing acting with their facial expressions and Southern accents. Some weaknesses in the film were the bigotry towards the Joad family and anyone considered to be like them as well. People did not see other people as they should have during that certain point in time. Casey's death, I thought, was a weakness as well. I felt as they should have he should have fought back some more and for what he believed to be true. Tom's monologue near the end of the film was another strength because he believed in a better tomorrow and in the hope of his fellow people. Ma's closing statement as they drove onwards at the climax of the film (though I preferred the book's ending far better) was yet another great strength in telling the audience that her people will never be wiped out, as Ma states with confidence and pride in her last lines to Pa.This film, being my second viewing, has opened my eyes to what true cinematic history was during that period of fighting to stay alive amidst a barren oasis. A mesmerizing yet tasteful view on what the Great Depression era was like really captured the essence of how it really was. This picture was a true portrayal of living, struggle and having a glimpse upon utmost freedom amidst an hour of flavorless desperation but also carrying with it the utmost refute to give in to despair with the will to just live.",

Yet it is much more than that - it is simply one of the finest movies ever made. Better acting you will never see - and while it's arguably (a very young) Henry Fonda's very best film, Jane Darwell puts in a performance you will never forget (and you won't soon forget her final line - one of the most historic, moving and memorable final lines in all of movie history). You can't get a better story than one written by John Steinbeck, of course, and the stark cinematography blazes new territory and remains fresh to this day. Even the \"lesser\" character actors shine brightly here. Who will forget John Qualen's performance as Muley or John Carradine's performance as Casey? ...And that's just scratching the surface. Who doesn't fall in love with and care about the main characters, as they desperately try to survive the rigors of the Depression (and whom among us could withstand the horrors they went through)? This is a real story - one that every American needs to know; there is no exaggeration here. The inhumanity heaped upon the most defenseless during the Depression - as brought out in this film - is something few movies have brought out. This is the quintessential Dust Bowl and Depression film. The realism is incredible. The music helps move you to tears, too. The heroism so many of the characters display is not just moving - it speaks of a time when more people were truly noble. What a cast! What a story! What a film!",

A pure piece of political bully-pulpit pounding shame.When you whittle away the bare bones from the withered flesh of a story, you find a simple message: BIG GOVERNMENT GOOD, STATES & LOCALS BAD. The way they portrayed it was crazy obvious. What I don't understand is why people sympathize with a double murderer, though motivated to such actions. It is a slanted logic that dictated men's lives as worthless where local justice is involved....in America. Never seen a message so ridiculous in film, the opposite being the truth--abuse and lack of justice within centralized government (just read the news).The question in the beginning of \"who is to blame\" for taking the farms points to the evil bankers, the evil overlords all up the ladder of capitalism, as if the owners had no rights to their own land, and their own financial mismanagement wasn't the fault of the grassroots- decision-maker. But, never mind that: details get in the way of a good leftist message. By the end it portrays a world that will never change and the people who try will just wither and blow away for the sake of cigar smoking, besuited fellows in brand new cars with extensive peach orchards and businesses.When I moved to California in the early 90s I met a lot of the old transplants who moved to CA in that time of need. They did pretty well for themselves. Ultimately, a displacement creates need and need is sated by people creating work and making things, people finding their place in the world. Maturity to understand how the world changes and corrects itself is what the story lacks completely. But, it wasn't a film made to reinforce the nature of the world, just to stir up some wrath.",

Saying that though great backgrounds do not make a film great.",

            "content": "The amazing thing about this film, besides the acting, script, directing, lighting, etc., is how clear it is about class exploitation.  The sharecroppers are being kicked off their land, but no one seems to at fault. When the company man is questioned he says, \"It's not my fault, I'm only doing what the bank tells me to do.\"  Farmer:  \"Well, I'll go to the bank.\" Company Man: \"Well, it ain't his fault.  He's just doing his job.\" Sharecropper:  \"Well, whose fault is it?\"  \"Brother, I wish I knew.\"  So, the first principle of exploitation, still present today, is to make the source of economic misery unlocateable.  How is this achieved?  Well, for one, politicians are in the service of the wealthy, but they also appear to be working for somthing called the \"American People.\"  A President like George W. Bush is obviously working for only the richest 1% of the people who live in the U.S. but he constantly looks for ways to appears to be working for the entire population.  He said: \"My economic security policy can be summed up in one word: Jobs.\"  And then he proposed a budget that cut job training across the nation.  The second principle of class exploitation clearly outlined in The Grapes of Wrath is that owners will always try and undercut wages by laying people off and throwing people out of work.  The Joads are told they'll be paid 5 cents a box of picked peaches, and then the next day this is cut down to 2 1/2 cents a box, and because there are starving people all around, they can get away with this.  This is still in effect today.  The wealthy class needs economic misery to keep wages down of ordinary people--this is why no state in the US pays a living wage of at least 11.00 an hour.  People actually have jobs for 6.50 an hour with out health care in this country!  There is no way that the great economy of Clinton could be sustained with a Bush in Whitehouse--which is exactly why it plummeted so fast after Bush stole the election.  I find The Grapes of Wrath to be the boldest Hollywood film ever made.  And in the end, when Henry Fonda starts putting 2+2 together, realizes that there is systematic exploitation of poor working people, there is a light in his eyes, a presence beyond the boundaries of his physical body: \"I'll be there...\" and by the end of film, we have made the journey from the scared individual all alone and helpless (Muley--who recounts the destruction of his farm) to Tom Joad's realization that the 97% of us without much of anything have to stick together to beat the remaining 3% of the wealthy who have politicians in their pockets and control the media.  It is Henry Fonda's portrayal of this growth of Tom Joad that makes him the best actor around who could have pulled off such a change.  Bravo!!!",

One technical aspect was how great the photography looked, by cinematographer Gregg Toland, one of the best in the industry at that time period. John Ford gave this movie excellent direction, he conveyed good character development and the movie had movement and progression, both in the storyline, the core meaning and the character relationships. It's a sad movie made in 1940, but taking place in the 30's during the dust bowl, families are forced to migrate west to California in hopes of finding work. With thousands of families migrating, few can be accommodated. For the family of Tom Joad luck was rare. The emotions, mood and feeling that come from the very roundness and progressiveness is what makes this movie so desirable. Also the shot composition and lighting really helped me feel the mood of the story. \"The Grapes of Wrath\" is a very realistic and sad story of man vs. law and man vs. society. It shows us how the best thing to do is to stick together with your loved ones and you'll get by. This was such and inspiring influential movie.",

This is a story of a family and friend's journey from Oklahoma to California in search of work and a new way of life. Watching the film I felt sad, seeing the condition due to the depression. The film gave views great insight to life during the depression, and the hardship faced by the people who had to live and make through it. How the conditions were so bad at this time that this group of people had to leave their homes, for one evening violating parole, to find a place when they could work and survive. I also was sad because of the misfortunes of the group traveling. The grape of wrath is a film that has great actors who play their parts well. They are believable. This is a film of realism. It's done so well that it's not only believable the viewers could see this film as an actual even that occur during that time in history. As far as the quality of the film's production go.

            "content": "By the time John Ford begun filming his adaption of John Steinbecks' depression-era novel late in 1939, a whole decade had passed since the Wall Street Crash sent the USA spiralling into economic crisis, yet its effects were still very much apparent with many Americans out of work and short of the money they lost on the stock market. Film studios did their best to help ordinary Americans forget their troubles with lavish musicals and comedies of the screwball variety, but with this picture Ford used his remarkable movie making skills to document the true harshness of the situation depicted in Steinbecks' book.The picture is given its much needed authenticity by the opening scene. On a bleak, dusty, open road in Oklahoma, we see Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) walking alone against a howling wind as he heads towards his family home (\"We lived here fifty years same place\") for the first time since he was released on parole from the state penitentiaries (\"You can't keep a Joad in jail\"- Grandpa Joad). Here he meets Casy (John Carradine), a preacher who no longer preaches because \"I got nothing' to preach about no more\". We learn that decent, hardworking families such as the Joads are being forced off their land by the greed of the bank. Many such people have farmed their land for decades and yet their homes are being destroyed and they are forced to seek their fortunes elsewhere.The story is a heartbreaking one, especially since the life that the Joads are forced to leave behind is all that they have known. Grandpa Joad (Charlie Grapewin) has to be forced off the territory by his own family- \"This is my land and I belong here...my dirt.\" The family face an arduous journey to the promised land of California, a journey which has tragic consequences for them. Upon arriving at a campsite they find starving children and other families who are very much in the same boat. One telling moment comes when the Joads see their faces for the first time. All of these people look glum, hopeless and devastated. Their expressions reveal the hardships of life at the campsite- \"It sure don't look none too prosperous\"-Tom Joad. The little work that is on offer is hardly enjoyable- picking peaches for five cents a box for example- \"a man can't make his dinner on that\". Furthermore, just as it seems the family have found a better place to stay for at least the time being there is more heartache around the corner-\"I guess it had to come, sooner or later\"-Ma Joad.The film not only presents an unfavourable picture of the bank who force people to live like \"pigs\" but also the police who are brutal, and the first camp which is far more inhabitable than the next camp the Joads move on to. Here they are stunned to find the luxury of toilets, showers, washtubs and entertainment every Saturday night. The tone is overall very bleak but there is always a glimmer of hope-\"We'll go on forever pa because we are the people\"- Ma Joad.The performance of Henry Fonda as Tom Joad is exceptional and he excels as the main character of the film whose flaw perhaps is his inability to restrain himself when he sees injustice before him- \"Whenever there's a cop beating up a guy, I'll be there\". Jane Darwell is very effective as Ma Joad in an Oscar-winning portrayal of a highly sympathetic character who tries to hold the family together through the series of crises they face. Also worth looking out for amongst the cast is Ford favourite Ward Bond as a policeman.The much acclaimed Greg Toland provides the films' impressive cinematography- he would famously work on Orson Welles' 1941 masterwork Citizen Kane. The film was cited by Bruce Springsteen as a big influence on his moving 1995 song 'The Ghost of Tom Joad'. Overall this is an excellent picture and it certainly made me think next time I face up to a problem- does it really seem bad when compared with what the Joads faced up to?",

The living conditions at all of the camps were for the most part unbearable. Rarely would there be running water or edible food. The effects of this movie were pretty realistic. Such as when Tom gets hit in the face, the makeup looks as though he was actually hit in the face.This movie was just too long for my taste. I feel as though a good portion of it could have been taken out, and we still would have received the message of the film. To me it did not make sense why Tom would be a former prisoner, and then in trouble with the cops. I feel as though all of that could have been left out because it took away from the actual point of the film, which was the Joad family going to California for work.",

There is an overall dark and depressing aspect to the film; families lost their land, homes, food, and great amounts of their wealth. Media tried to cover the reality of the situation by reporting deaths due to heart failure or stroke, instead of starvation, which was the reality. It was a trying time for many people, and Grapes of Wrath, shows what it was like for one family to lose their home to the Depression. All they want to do is go to California, but when they get to the land of \"Milk and Honey\" there isn't as much hope there as they had thought. The camera work for this film was overall good. There were beautiful shots of the environment and land surrounding them. Although the film is a realistic interpretation of a very historical period in American history, it seems to be quite dull. John Ford (Director of the film) may have tried to make too much happen in the film. The family can never catch a break and there's no profound change, making the story seem somewhat repetitive and hard to sit through, and really enjoy/get into.",

I understand that the film is meant to show the struggles of families in the midwest during the depression and it certainly did a good job getting that point across.I perked up at the very end when Tom told his mother that he was going to try and do something about the land and attempt to gather protester's, which would have given the movie a bit more action or just a specific direction.

At first, you're not sure if this will be a good movie, mostly because of the behaviors of Charley Grapewin and Zeffie Tilbury's characters, who come off as some sort of senile comic relief pair. Later on, however, you realize that the movie is shaped around the struggle this family encounters as they go West. Henry Fonda makes for an incredible lead role, mostly because of the fact that he's a criminal and the last thing you'd expect for him to act like a generic \"momma's boy.\" It's his rebelliousness that also makes this character likable, seeing how we could of acted the same way if we were in his shoes. The dialogue is memorable, the shadows and sound effects really draw in the atmosphere of West, and the final speech(es) of the film tie everything together spectacularly.

I found it also liberating to a certain extent, it made current situations and problems in my current life seem not so hard up after all, at least i haven't been forced out of the home and shipped off to a farm to work for a measly 2 cents... Not yet of course ( considering the shape of our current economy / government ) I enjoyed the casting of shadows, and that most of the film was shot at night, this really gave me the sense of darkness, loneliness, and uncertainness.

It's interesting that this event was reenacted into film so close to the era that it actually took place. Ma Joad was my favorite character because of her determination to keep the family together. In such trying times, it appeared to be very hard for the family to appreciate each other. An idea that I found to be odd, I always assumed that it was struggles such as this one that brought people closer. The black and white cinematography really helped portray the desperation and hopelessness emotion of the film.",

            "content": "I have to note that the characterization in this film is very good. It is as if you can really hear and see the pain each character is experiencing. For example when Tom first meets Casy the viewer can easily identify that he has drawn drastically far from his former beliefs and life as a preacher. Henry Fonda (Tom) does a phenomenal job of portraying the sort of rough around the edges but good hearted type. Most of his significant plot developing actions consist of him perhaps doing the \"wrong thing\" but for the right reason for instance when he hits the sheriff. Because the film is centered around depression era Midwest farmers it may be difficult to connect with on a personal level. That said, one thing any whole hearted person can relate to in this film is the love and dedication we have for our families, how important it is, and how it truly reveals itself in times of hardship. To me that was the overwhelming social significance of the film. In the end when Tom is forced to skip town because of the sheriff he tells his mother he plans to fight for injustice. Although it is definitely sad I feel as if Tom gains fulfillment from using his edge and aggression to combat unfairness. Weather it was Casy's attacker or the Sheriff it was clear Tom did what he did for the right reasons and felt good about it despite the consequences. Symbolically as we see Tom off to seek his fulfillment it appears his family may be fortunate enough to seek theirs too as they hear of work north of the camp. Overall touching film and I enjoyed it. On a side note I think their truck may have been the inspiration for The Hollywood Hillbillies.",

            "content": "During the Great Depression and today's recession, it's important for families to never give up hope on themselves and keep looking foreword and ahead to the future as they want to advance towards a better life in an economic, political, and social standpoint. Sometimes,money doesn't usually bring happiness and success for people, only family, respect for others, and love are what keeps a family together. No matter how many times a person hasn't succeeded in a goal, they continue to persevere until they make themselves happy and successful in their goals as well as making their family proud.It was Steinbeck's novel and the screen writing is what made this movie stand out as the best movie of 1940.The narrative writing of the film was full of realism by showing us what it would have been like to live in a poor family that's been evicted by their home by greedy land owners, banks, gangs, and sheriffs that are supposed to protect the people from harm's way in the Dust Bowl of the 1930's. The narrative allows viewers to feel the experience and be in the movie as the actors were reliving real life experiences of moving away from home,exploring life, traumatized by death, despair, anger, and hope of finding a new life. The overall acting in this movie was excellent and well shown through their actions, the directing, and the script. The use of real natural wind, light, and the outdoor setting also made the story even more realistic and believable within the time period of the depression giving the film a more realistic feel. The photography and the use of the camera lens was excellent!! The juxtaposition of the two pictures of images in Muley's flashback and the movement through the states as shown by the signs in the moving time period, flowed well with ease through the story and adding the dimension of how the family drove and persevered to reach their goals and their attempts to save their homes from destruction. The use of shallow depth of field, lights and darks on the actor's faces, and the dark and light contrast in the sky was used very well in the film. The dark contrast and shadows brought out the mood of fear,anger, worry, and sadness that each of the characters expressed throughout the film during the tough economic crisis that was very emotional for the entire United States. Lighting created a sense of emotion, depth,mood, and how we see these characters in the film. Lighter outdoor scenes in the film were very opportunistic and bright as the families were looking into a happier life in the future.This's the best movie that Zannuck has ever made in his life!! I would recommend this movie to everybody that needs to be influenced and want to persevere into having a better life for their family during the recession or need to be cheered up. It's an excellent movie overall!!",

Having to read this for an english class I bet people just watched the movie and were too lazy to read the book. Hollywood can never portray a story from a book.

Unlike other movies they can never seem to catch a break. Grandparents die, their trucks runs out of gas many times, a pregnant women traveling with them is very sick, and they do not have money to feed the children. This movie also shows the bad environments that they are made to live in at government camp and the terrible treatment of workers. Throughout the movie the family never seemed to be in a good place and it dragged on. It was very boring and I didn't need a two hour movie to get the point. I think that if the movie was 40 minuets shorter it would have been a better experience for me.

I also thought the film got too political. It wouldn't have been so bad the politics not been so uneducated or naive, but I can't really expect anything different.The cinematography and visuals in the film alone are enough reason to watch the film.

Overall, I found this film to be enjoyable in that it held my interest and made me feel like I was learning about an important piece of American history that's often forgotten. One positive aspect of the movie was the acting of Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, a young farmer, and John Carradine as Tom Casy a former preacher. I was also struck by the perseverance and hopefulness of the Joad family. Even though one misfortune after another happens to them, they never give up hope. There seems to be a message here about how people can come out okay no matter how bad their situation is if they keep trying. On a less positive note, some of the travel scenes were a bit boring and could have been shortened.",

            "content": "I found this film to be touching, not only because of the Joad family's unfortunate situation but because this really happened during the Great Depression and in some cases on a far worse level. It's a shame that the whole family started off with twelve members and at the end of the movie only ended up with seven or eight. I commemorate the overall spirit of the family for not giving up and working together to make ends meet and establish a life for themselves. During this time it was very bad for farmers because they were forced off their land with no other direction to go in. Many people died and starved and fought tooth and nail for even the smallest, short lasting job out there. What really makes this film touching and unique is the fact that this actually took place in history and it gave people some insight on how others were suffering and how to be kind and compassionate towards others. When the family stumbled upon the camp that was run by the Department of Agriculture it demonstrated the kindness and compassion that was needed in order for people to survive and make it through the next day. Having that ultimately unified the people into preventing a so called \"riot\" to take place at a local dance just as a excuse for the sheriffs to show up and ransack the place. Tom and mama's little speeches towards the end touched the heart of the audience and affirmed the idea that no matter how hard things get in life you should always keep going and do your best and never give up to live a happy and healthy life. Another thing to add regarding the form is that the camera angles were very pleasing for being an older movie because during exciting scenes, like when there was a fight or a chase taking place, the camera man did very well in following every movement and the different angles made it more exciting to watch and made the audience feel as if they were really there watching it. Overall this was a great film in my opinion because a.) I'm a sucker for historical films and b.) the plot is one that could never get old and ultimately would touch the heart of anyone watching it.",

The movie created a portrait for us to see as it goes through the trails this family has to battle. The costumes in this movie not only helped gave us a visual on what the 30's were like; it allowed us to forget about the reality we currently are in. Again, this is the genius of film making.

It's not just the movie, it's the play too. I really just can't enjoy the story when it's about a subject as dry as the dust bowl.The acting by Henry Fonda is fantastic. The classic scene at the end is one of the best performances in American cinema. Jane Darwell's performance was also just great. She was wonderful and completely deserved the Oscar for this movie.

Henry Fonda is perfectly cast as Tom, and does a great job at making the viewer believe the plight that one would have when having to move off of their land due to the dust bowls.

The acting performances in the film are just about flawless with Jane Darwell contributing one of the great performances in the history of cinema with a tour de force in her portrayal of Ma Joad. Ford's direction is absolutely outstanding in his achievements in setting the perfect tone and mood with great lighting, visuals, sounds and art direction. The only thing keeping me from giving the film a 10 out of 10 is the slightly inconsistent performance by Henry Fonda as Tom. Overall it was a wonderful performance but there were times when it seemed to me like he was hitting the wrong notes.

That goes to say the acting was great and the story was nice. If you are a history fanatic or just love to watch history movies then I recommend that you watch this film. If you prefer movies that have more action in them then I still recommend that you watch this film because it's a great film to watch to be aware of how the great depression affected those in the US.",

            "content": "This film is great for many reasons, primarily because it was adapted from John Steinbeck's timeless novel. Although Steinbeck's original thoughts and emotions are written down in the text, John Ford and this cast do a superb job of conveying these emotions and thoughts on screen. Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad, and does so flawlessly. Each character has their own influence on making this movie great in different ways. At first, we see Tom fresh out of jail, naive to the current times and angry with people and the world in general for the state most people are in during the depression. Toward the end, Tom realizes he can't control every situation presented him, and matures over the course of the film by accepting things that he can't change. Although he carries with him good intentions, the Joad's and many like them are victims of the times.Steinbeck's novel is a classic, and I think that John Ford does an excellent job of paying his due diligence through this movie. If you are familiar with Steinbeck you'll already know that he writes of many things simultaneously, that is, many of the things he says can be taken at face value or delved into deeply and contemplated end over end. John Ford understands this, and it shows in scenes where his characters give monologues, usually with close up shots to show the raw emotion in their faces. At the end of the movie we see Tom saying farewell to his mother before leaving the ranch. Mrs. Joad inquires, \"What'll you do Tom, go off? How'll you survive- what if you get killed? I'd never see you again\", to which Tom replies, \"Ma I'll be everywhere helpin' out the everyman. (If I were to die) I'll be there when a cop is beatin' a poor fella for no reason, where children laugh because they're hungry, an' they know supper's ready... I'll be everywhere.\" It is here that we see Tom's change in his character, which is reflective of the entire country at the time. Beaten and broken, most are forced to fend for themselves in hopes of finding better days. Tom is the opposite, looking out for those he loves and complete strangers simultaneously.This movie reflects the nation as a whole of the time, and gives us a peek into the simple will and desire of those folks to merely get by without worrying about starving or having a place to sleep at night. As Ma Joad says, \"We'll keep on forever 'cause we're the people. Born on this dirt, live, die, and pass on to the youngster's here, we'll keep on going forever\". See it, read it, love it.",

It may just be my mood at the time but I can't seem to get behind the cause of the characters no matter what.

But maybe that's just how his character is written to be. After he learned that his home was being taken away and his family was forced to move, he just became like that. My one issue from the beginning of the movie is the family asking Tom \"Did you bust out?!\" can we get an explanation on why he would've busted out of prison? He got out on good behavior. Also, the way that Ma uses the grandma's corpse as a way to get through the checkpoint is kinda hilarious but also morbid at the same time, as a viewer I knew that the grandma was gonna die but she was sick and then it just cuts to Ma with the zombie-like grandma in her lap.

The only thing that kind of got me out of it was that I was so out of touch with the characters, most of them I couldn't connect with and it just made me not be fully engaged in the movie. I think Tommy is a very interesting main character, his past is made for you to not trust him or think he's a good person. Especially in the way he talked to the truck driver in the beginning, but he grew as a person throughout the entire movie and with every bump in the road he hit with his family it definitely made him stronger and a more likable character. I think Tommy's ending monologue was very touching and it was one of those things that I thought about after the movie was over, something about him listing the places he'll be in to his mother was just very meaningful.

What I mean is the film is great on it's own and ,unlike most film adaptations of books, this movie kept most of the others message intact. The key difference I found was that the book was much sadder. I know it's hard to believe seeing how depressing this movie was but their were many things the director chose not to show. The biggest difference was in the endings. The film leaves you with some since of optimism for these people, the novel does no such thing. The book leaves you with Rosasharn giving birth to a stillborn and offering her breast milk to a man dying of starvation. This obviously could have never been shown in theaters during the 1940's and I'm glad for it. I believe it would have been one powerful scene but the book was way to sad to begin with and the film was pretty depressing as well. Currently we could have handled a film like that just fine but back in the 1940's this was some amazingly heavy stuff. I just think keeping to Steinbeck's original ending would have instilled to much ill feelings in Americans in a time where we needed some optimism. So great film, don't watch it though if you can't handle a little despair though.",

The movie really painted a clear picture of everything the book was trying to say. The adaptation from book to film was a work of art in itself. It has such a powerful social message that is really hit home through the way it is directed and the way the actors worked together. Also, I felt that the cinematographer of the film did a wonderful job at capturing the fields and open skies of Oklahoma. The Grapes of Wrath is one of the most realistic and captivating films that I have seen and definitely left me in awe, and thinking about the issues it presented.",

Director John Ford pulls no punches. Other than the direct effects of the depression, the depiction of the lengths people go to to abuse the hurting of other humans is crazy (and probably true). Yet, among all the self interest, there are acts of kindness and selflessness that leave you with hope for the world. Henry Fonda is great as Tom Joad, and deserved his Best Actor Oscar nomination. Supporting cast did a pretty good job, with Jane Darwell (as Ma Joad), to the fore. Her Best Supporting Actress Oscar was well deserved. A must-see, realistic human drama at its best.",

I think that Tom was a very selfish character as he still got into fights after getting out of jail even though he could have been caught and ruined the chances his family had to find a better way of living. I also hate how they brought up the mom as the glue of the family, but if i remember well she only really had like two moments when she acted like the \"glue\".

While they do show the history part very well the entertainment aspect is lacking. They do the bare minimum to keep the audience focused and into the movie. If you took all the camps and historical facts out of the movie it would be a confusing and uninteresting mess. This movie has potential but if killing off someone every time it gets boring is the producers idea of keeping the audience entertained it is doomed.

However certain additions to the movie that separate it from the book, including a totally different ending that neither Ford or Toland wanted to add give the movie a contradictory feeling to it (thanks to the PCA).The harsh struggles of the Joads throws the viewer into a world of desperation, mistreatment, and death. Anyone that saw this during it's original must have been moved, as for today's generation, it's hard to imagine the kind of destitution and difficulties the families of the depression endured. And as the viewer begins to sympathize with the Joad's situation, Ford throws a curve with how Tom Joad acts during a meeting with an lost friend.While it's clear this movie had a political message in mind, the restrictions of the PCA almost ruin the ending, giving almost an opposite message that Ford had.Technically, Toland is at his usual greatness, putting together shots that make the film appear so real that the viewer wants to step out of their seat and into the scene. While watching The Grapes of Wrath, it's easy for the viewer to forget the advantages of the life we live now and to step into the depression and feel the pain of the main characters.",

He comes home to an empty house and the news his family has lost his land and thus their source of income and survival and from here the family makes their journey across the county suffering many hardships along the way.Being released just a year after the Great Depression officially ended in 1939 many movie goers related to this film like nothing they had ever seen. It stands today as a reminder of the struggles that we as a nation have overcome and the strength of the average American family.Besides its historical significance the film was also a major success for the style of the early 1940's. It combined studio setting with location setting which was typical of the time. It was also directed by Ford which resulted in much of his style which included many long and medium range shots. The use of light was typical for the time, which met it was used to determine between good and bad characters and to set the mood of the over all scenes in the film. One example of this includes a scene where the corrupt cops beat and kill a friend of the family. in this scene it is the lack of light that makes it typical for the time period.

My favorite part of the movie was when Tom Joad got hit by the sheriffs and it left a scar. Tom Joad then had to flee the camp because he was wanted. The method that they used to get out of the camp was to hide him under blankets in the family car. I would recommend this movie to anyone wanting a good idea of how the people in Oklahoma in the 1930s were treated.

Someone dies but can't say. The grandpa didn't want to go so they got him drunk and put him in the back of the truck. Kinda rude but ok. The first camp they went to the cops came and tried to arrest a guy for \"a fight\" that probably didn't happen. The guy ran and the cop shot at him but somehow missed very badly and shot a random lady randomly standing in the road. Yeah also it is in black and white so it is kinda hard to see them at night but watch if you want.",

The ending was disappointing, John thought he was helping his family by leaving because he was being chased by the cops but he also left his family during desperate times.

Human spirit struggling; people moving from one place to other leaving everything they have for a new better life, dealing with moral dilemmas, taking care of older parents, hunger, misery, all these elements are always present in one way or another in those days but what I loved about this movie is the \"hope\", the way this American movie believes in the human spirit and doesn't lead everything to a dramatic tragedy.

The acting by Tommy was outstanding and really was intriguing the entire film. To me the character that stood out the most was the mama. She portrayed the lady of the house very well with all the cooking and the cleaning and caring for the family. It was only right that she got rewarded at the end. This film was an alright film but I don't think I would watch it again for fun. In my opinion not one of Ford's best films.",

            "review_title": "Analysis of The Grapes of Wrath; 1940 film",
            "content": "The following comment surmises the Classic book: The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck, but also pertains to scenes and events from the award winning 1940 picture.John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath is a stunningly realistic account of the daunting lifestyles of mid-western and southern farmers, who after having endured the vicissitudes of several consecutive years of drought and the lack of crop growth are compelled to relinquish ownership of their properties and move west for the prospect of a frivolous life, where fruits and vegetables are abundant and where labor is easy and prevalent. The historical significance of this movement is portrayed through the eyes of Steinbeck's memorable fictional characters: Casey, Tom Joad and his family. Having been recently released on parole from prison for the execution of a man, Tom Joad is keen on returning to his family once more. The identity of the man Tom has killed remains undisclosed throughout the book due to the fact that the significance of Tom's atrocity is not of the man he killed, but the reason he killed him. John Steinbeck built his book on characters with dormant animosity. The poor yield of the crops, the famine and pessimism of the future has all amounted to irrational wrath and unconventional violence. On his journey homebound Tom confronts a listless figure with his back against a tree bark and is surprised to discover that the person is none other than Casey, the preacher. Casey enlightens Joad that he is no longer a preacher and has given up a life of piety for the life of a \"normal man\". Here again, the ingenuity of Steinbeck's plot is witnessed, because the preacher's neglect of God shows that he unequivocally faces the predilections and dilemmas of the common people. He being a pastor does not make him exempt of the impending crisis soon to befall. By the time Tom Joad and Casey have reached Tom's former abode, they perceive that it has been abandoned and has been left to decay and disintegrate in putridity. When Tom asks a fellow farmer as to what has become of his family, he is aware that they have relocated elsewhere and are planning to embark on a tedious exodus west in a few days time. The grapes of wrath are beginning to plant their roots.Tom and Casey reach Tom's family by nightfall and Tom asks his mother when they were to leave. She replies that they were to leave tomorrow morning. He then inquires whether or not they would have left, had he still been in prison. Tom's mother (alluded to as Ma) assures him that they would have dispatched an epistle. Now Steinbeck addresses the dire earnestness of the situation, by showing that Tom's family would have went west, whether he was in prison or not. When Tom's capricious grandpa adamantly rejects to moving west with the rest of the family he is knocked unconscious and sprawled upon the tarpaulin, which furthermore shows the vital importance of the move west. Soon after their departure, Grandpa falls ill and later succumbs to his sickness. He is given a banal burial, and the family along with Casey moves on, showing that even death would not intervene with the necessity of a better life out west. Later in the story when Tom's grandmother falls ill, the truck stops in front a checkpoint and an officer peruses about the items and occupants on board. Tom's mother ardently refuses for the mandatory checking, claiming that there are no liquids on board and that they have an ailing woman who is in need of critical medical attention. The officer permits them through out of maudlinness and when the rest of the family realizes that the grandmother is deceased they ask why she never informed them. She replies that she was scared the guards wouldn't let them through if they had known it was so, and once again we are blatantly witnessed to the importance of the migration west.From thence forth the family is labeled as \"Okies\", not pertaining to the place of their birth, but a bias slur, generalizing them as simpletons who have neither food nor work, and ramp about the country pleading for undeserved privileges and necessities.Goaded on by the lack of food and substantial work, the Joads reach California. Pa says something along the lines of \"It will all be better once we get to California.\" and Tom replies that \"We are already in California\", signifying that life for them in the Midwest would be no different from life in California. Acres upon acres of plentiful fruits and vegetables which were not of their possession, but of the possession of the affluent, avaricious landowners were a mere ploy in the eyes of the Okies. They were there, redolent, serene and glistening, mocking the \"Okies\" for having come all that way merely to perceive something they would never have the ability to obtain. The grapes sagged on the branches of the Californian bushes. Troubles sagged on the hearts of the Okies and the wrath intensified into pure rage. The grapes of wrath had sewn their stalks in the hearts of the Okies.Envy and spite instills within the former preacher Casey, to audaciously strike a cop who arrives to intentionally conjure trouble out of his own initial contempt. Casey is sent to prison and the family resumes in search of work and solace. Solace is found when the family reaches a stable government camp, where not only are hot baths and commodious tents bourgeois accessories but the affable people accentuate the atmosphere. The realization that life in the government camp is ephemeral goads the Joads onwards once more and Steinbeck idyllically portrays his use of deception by making his readers believe that a glorious life is prevalent when in all actuality it is not (he uses this style in Of Mice and Men as well).",

I feel like it is stupid because they can be spend years of their life farming and then their kids framing to just for it to end in a blink of an eye and becomes homeless and don't have money or resource to help me get back up from being broke and and the worst part is trying to feed everyone when knowing that everyone won't survive and if they get sick to a bad part as well but this movie shows you a lot that what happened in that year of depression and how bad it was for most people who couldn't find a job or got run out of a job.",

Tom is reunited with his family after serving a four year prison sentence for killing a guy in a dance hall. Ford has such a fluid style of film making. The viewer becomes a part of the family as they pack into their old truck and head west to California. I find that Ford uses a lot of visual metaphors to convey his ideas. For instance, when a families house is demolished, ford pans down to the shadows of the family cast over the tracks of the tractor. Symbolizing the destruction of their whole life. With each day the situation seems to get worse as the sun goes down, but each day brings a new hope as the sun comes over the horizon. The film makers fully understood the effects of lighting, that's part of what makes Fords films so great.",

The story of the Oakies having to leave their homes for work and opportunities and the losses they went through is tragic and very interesting.

            "review_title": "A Well Deserved Place In The Library Of Congress",
            "content": "Based on the landmark novel by John Steinbeck, John Ford's film adaptation of The Grapes Of Wrath has become almost as large a cultural force as its inspiration. It was selected as one of the first twenty- five films to be archived in the Library Of Congress as a significant cultural artifact and, in my opinion, this was done with very good reasons.The story of the Joad family making the trek from Oklahoma through to California in search of work during the American depression will be familiar to many people, and as such I will not talk at length about the film's plot. What I will discuss, however, is the deftness with which this material is handled by Ford.Gritty and realistic the photography and direction of the movie is one of the high points of cinema history. Nothing appears by accident, but nothing is drawn too obviously to the audiences attention. Tom Joad (wonderfully played by Henry Fonda) lighting hand-rolled cigarette in a moment of quiet contemplation, ex-preacher Casy's (John Carradine) nervous twitching as he tries to find his role in the world, and the Joad kids' (Darryl Hickman and Shirley Mills) resigned playing as their stomachs softly growl: all of this is shown with such a lack of overt stylisation that they become some of the most touching and heart- wrenching images to be displayed outside of a documentary.The attention to detail too is great to witness. The actors wear no make-up as they play their parts in an effort for realism and the car that takes them on their trying journey is the same Hudson \"Super Six\" Sedan described by Steinbeck. Nothing feels staged or overly Hollywood, but rather it all comes across so naturally that one can almost smell the miasma of dirt and sweat that surrounds this unhappy lot.I think, however, that some of the biting realism of this film have been lost over the years, or at least relegated to being somewhat of a quaint charm. I mean, Steinbeck's novel is taught in many schools and people have become very familiar with the story over the many years since it was written, and this is be no means a bad thing (in fact it makes me happy to think that Steinbeck is still so well respected and widely read), but it does mean that someone sitting down to watch The Grapes Of Wrath for the first time is unlikely to have anything similar to the reaction that audiences had at the time.The socialist undertones and dissection of the pain caused by a capitalist system left to its own devices now come as part of the package when one hears the title The Grapes Of Wrath, no longer will one be surprised, shocked, and reduced to tears of righteous indignation when these images are presented to them. The discussion of 'pinks' and 'reds' are not so immediate to a modern audience as to make them bristle with deep-rooted political allegiances, but rather they pass the modern viewer by completely or serve only as some historical curiosity of a bygone time.I suppose that it is better that the conditions of Steinbeck's book and Ford's film do not persist to the current day, but it is still somewhat of a shame that these reactions have been lost, and that a full visceral understanding of the film is almost unattainable today. But still the film must be viewed as a triumph and a masterpiece which does and will remain relevant now and for a long time to come.",

            "content": "I haven't read the novel so can't compare to it; but I am sure from what I have heard that it is like one of the greatest novels of 19th century, the movie probably falls short of the novel. Expressing emotion in a restrained fashion, without using overtly emotional words or body language is something I have now come to associate with the B/W Hollywood cinema. But even accounting for that, the emotive quotient of the movie could have been a tad higher. The Joad family cuts across the width of America from Oklahoma to California in a dumpster truck, lock stock and barrel. Poor grandpa doesn't want to leave the earth he grew up in and the earth grants him the wish, albeit in a tragic way as he dies en-route. Grandma follows suit, though much closer to California. Her burial scene is unceremoniously skipped and I found her body getting carried along with live people for so long a little macabre honestly. The kids seem to have no context of the whole situation which is again a bit weird given that the girl is pretty grown up. They are just happy-go-lucky all the time not missing a single thing and not regretting any piece of the journey. Uncle John also doesn't show any character, nor does the pregnant women. In fact, I believe the chief character of the movie is the mother, but she symbolizes the all-too-familiar middle class matriarch much more than a woman from the time and space she is required to represent in the movie. The situations themselves are assumed to be already known to the audience with the screenplay not bothering too much with explaining the details of what is going on. So my verdict - one time watch. Also I am going to read the novel now and I am sure after that I am going to understand the movie more and like it even less.",

            "content": "John Ford's \"Grapes of Wrath\" captures the salt-of-the-earth Dust Bowl destitution of the Steinbeck novel from which it is adapted. The Joads' trek west is every bit as entrepreneurial as that of the emerging agricultural barons for whom they toil, albeit motivated by survival rather than riches. Position is everything, whether that means fighting to stay or conniving to leave. Ford's cinematography, dialog, and plot bring land to life as another character in the film, animated by the Joads' do-or-die movements across it.From the opening shot, the terrain is something to be contended with. A high-angle exterior shot of our protagonist Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) walking down the road photographs ground more than half-way up the celluloid. (Perhaps the geometry of this shot influenced that of the crop-duster scene in Hitchcock's \"North By Northwest\"). Intersecting roads and telephone wires create a rectilinear lattice confining the shot's subject, telegraphing how confined Joad's choice-set will prove. (The store he walks into is called \"Cross Roads.\") More high horizons\u2014 most memorably, a high-contrast night shot of the sheriffs' ominous headlights bearing down on the Joads' old house\u2014further the impression that the distance the Joads must traverse is a wall they must drive through. If the wealthy typically speak of nouns they own and the healthy, of verbs they do, those tethered to the plane beneath their feet for bare subsistence\u2014the Joads\u2014speak in prepositions. Their life is cartographic. When the Joads can occupy their land, they're \"on it,\" and when they're evicted, they're ordered to \"get off\" and they're \"throwed off.\" Now, their aim is not stillness, but control of position; seeing Tom, Grandpa exults, \"They couldn't keep him in!\" \"You can't keep a Joad in jail!\" The scene evolves into a comedic sketch in which just about everyone asks Tom if he \"busted out.\" The family's watchword is \"across\": they have got to keep marching *across*, even if the grueling pace costs Grandma her life. Similarly, compass directions\u2014those siblings of prepositions\u2014are ever on the tip of the tongue, furnishing, for instance, a pretense for the family's escape from the farm (they had gotten a job \"up north\"). Plot developments will confirm our sense that the earth has heft\u2014heft enough to kill (if their jalopy craps out in the desert, as the gas station attendant warns them), or enough to nourish (if its fruits will command five cents a bucket rather than two-and-a-half). Even minor plot details reinforce the primacy of terra firma: when burning family mementos before embarking, Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) spares a souvenir of the Louisiana Purchase. Now *that* was a deal on a plot of land. As for Tom, he made it from prison to Oklahoma to California and now he's got too much momentum to cast anchor. Where to next? \"I'll be everywhere,\" he tells us in his final monologue. \"Wherever there's a cop beating up a guy, I'll be there.\" And for all his work in the dry dirt, he's finally transcended the terrestrial: \"I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad. . . . And when people are eating the stuff they raise, living in the houses they build, I'll be there, too.\"",

            "content": "The Grapes of Wrath (1940) based on John Steinbeck's Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name represents an unflinching depiction of the realities of farming during the Great Depression. The film was directed by John Ford and produced by Darryl F. Zanuck, with Nunnally Johnson writing the screenplay. The Grapes of Wrath stars Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell, and John Carradine. The film was nominated for seven academy awards, with John Ford winning for best director and Jane Darwell winning for best actress in a supporting role.The Grapes of Wrath focuses on the Joads, a family of Oklahoman farmers in the 1930s. The film opens on Tom Joad (Henry Fonda), the eldest son of the Joad family who has recently been released from prison and is hitchhiking home to his family. He encounters Jim Casy (John Carradine) along the way, a preacher who baptized Tom years prior but has since lost his faith. The pair travel together to the Joad's farm, where we learn that the dire economic circumstances caused by the Great Depression and the devastation of the Dust Bowl has seen the Joad family forced from their land, along with thousands of other sharecropper families throughout the state. With scant options and desperate for work, the Joads decide to migrate west to California, which at the time was being touted as a haven of opportunity.The film follows the Joads as they make their way to California and depicts the heartache and hardship that migrants faced while traveling westward. Upon their arrival, the Joads quickly realize that California is not the welcoming and opportunity-laden promised-land that had been advertised. As the Joads travel through migrant camps experiencing deplorable conditions and brutal treatment, Ford takes the viewer on a journey that documents the stark realties faced by hundreds of thousands of displaced migrant workers.The events that transpire in the latter half of the film (which will not be described due to major spoilers) culminate in Tom recognizing the importance of social organizing in the face of injustice, and taking on an activist mantle to fight for change.In summary, The Grapes of Wrath is a cinematic achievement that stands the test of time. Henry Fonda's portrayal of Tom Joad was marvelous, his acting style perfectly suited to the role. The musical score was a huge technological feat during the time it was produced, supplementing the film's striking visuals and cinematography. While faithful to the novel, the film ends on an uplifting note, an excellent choice (in my opinion) that offers the audience a sense of hope and purpose.",

Just with the telephone poles and everything it was a great opening scene to draw in viewers. the story itself of a man, Tom Joad, is one to grab anyones attention. The concept of Tom Joad(an ex convict) breaking his parole to move out west to California with his family was outstanding to me because it was sort of a bad-to-the-bone thing to do and thats definitely enough to get one like myself to watch any film.i definitely recommend this to everyone.

            "content": "The Grapes of Wrath was formally based off a book by John Steinbeck and was adapted to a movie directed by John Ford in 1940. The film is set in the Dust Bowl era in Oklahoma and follows a family who was driven off their farm due to the dust storms and poverty. Homeless and poor, the family decides to leave Oklahoma to find more work to support financial needs. The family ventures out towards California in hopes of finding employment and a better quality of life. The best-known actors that appear in the film are Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, Jane Darwell as Ma Joad, and John Carradine as Jim Casey.I personally have mixed feelings about this movie. I will start with the good first. The lighting in the movie. I thought this was interesting because it makes it feel more real and as if you are also there in person. I also like the story and how it was based off realistic events such as the Great Depression. It expresses to the audience what life was like and how moving with little to no money was a challenge. The overall message of the movie that I got was to keep on going even if there are many difficulties.The terrible things about the movie were how the characters act towards each other, especially when there is a tragic loss. Everyone seemed to move on very quickly or was indifferent after an incredibly sad event. That was overall an unnatural emotion for a particular scene. It was like that event was not important and did not affect anyone. It felt like \"oh well, whatever\" type of deal. Another detail I did not like was that the characters only referred to other characters as their title name instead of their relationship with each other. For example, when a mother calls their husband \"father\" even if there are no children present. It bothers me because a mother would call their husband by their name in private without children in the picture. This movie made it unnatural to keep the character titles such as \"grandpa\" the same and not to going into the family dynamics more.Overall, I would recommend this movie to watch. Whether it's to enjoy the unique candle lighting or making fun of the scenes that have unnatural reactions. The Grapes of Wrath surprisingly caught my attention and held it through the movie.",

            "review_title": "A good piece but lacks some essential character interaction outside of Tom and Ma Joad",
            "content": "It's a decent adaptation, The Grapes of Wrath. Sure, it feels a bit like a fast run of some of the events but the pacing is not a big issue and the characters are mainly very well acted, especially Henry Fonda as Tom Joad and Jane Darwell as Ma Joad. Their mother-son relationship was one of the carrying forces in the book as well as the strong character of Ma Joad. They were delivered well in the film too! Especially the scene where Tom asks Ma to dance with him was very touching in my opinion and I don't remember them having such in the book so that was a great addition. Also I think the ending the book had wouldn't have worked in a film mode because of the fact that Tom left the family some time before the story ended and the final scene wouldn't have been very fitting in the movies of the time, I reckon.Having just read the book, however, I couldn't help but feel that the movie fell a little short in what comes to some of the other characters and the relations between them such as the brotherhood between Tom and Al Joad. Al, in the picture, was a very minor character who just drove the truck and tried to chase girls. In the book one of my favorite scenes was where Al, who kind of admires and looks up to Tom, got mad at himself because the truck busted on the road and they had to get new parts from a repair shop. Tom straightened him and told the punk not to think everything should go just as he thinks and it's not his fault. I wish I had an older brother who could have been like that. Guess you can't fit everything there but it was a segment I enjoyed a lot as a young man myself. Then there's a lot of interaction between Ma and Rose of Sharon in the book as well and I found some of it humorous too because Rose of Sharon was a little too tender and foolish at times and Ma tried to toughen her up a lot. None of that was presented in the film either.The little oofs I paid attention to: The character of Noah Joad. Sure, he wasn't very remarkable in the book either but the way they handled him in the film was really weird. He was there at the beginning and the part in which he decided to leave the family and go off on his own was left out entirely so he just disappeared without any remarks being made about it. Without reading the book it is impossible to know why he suddenly isn't there anymore. Also the casting of Casy the ex-preacher raised my eyebrows a bit. The actor John Carradine was actually a year younger than Henry Fonda whose character he claims to have baptized in the movie too! Couldn't they at least leave that line out? I always imagined he was like 50-60 years old anyway.Last say on the look and cinematography in the movie: I think they were great and the movie captured the nighttime sequences absolutely beautifully. The long shots John Ford uses to show the characters and the truck they drove against the rugged terrain surrounding them are stunning considering the era the film was made. That kind of visual look must've influenced many generations to come and I can see similar aspects in many of my favorite movies as well. The man deserved his Oscar, I think.8/10",

I loved how the car was falling apart every five seconds, how the grandfather was going insane, and how they reacted to different situations. It was hilarious when the grandmother died in the car and how the people only found out when they pointed a bright flashlight directly at her face. It was also funny in the beginning of the movie when they were hiding in the bushes, probably only fifteen feet from the police and the police couldn't find them. The police didn't even take their job seriously, they only threw a rock at the window and asked if there was anyone there and just left. I also really liked how the movie was set in the time period they were in, so we were able to see what the people looked like back then. They most likely did not have any errors in how it was like during that time, so I enjoyed seeing how raw it was. The actors and actresses most likely went through something like that as well, not their farms getting taken away, but the sadness of the Great Depression. This probably helped them act better in the movie because they understood the travesty of it. Most movies that are based off of a certain time period are usually bad because the people who made the movie have not gone through it. The information that they also put in the movie is mostly wrong and they have an inaccurate depiction of what happened. I also liked that they showed how horrible it was when the government forced all the farmers to move out of their farms to go to California. You could see how much grief they went through having known that what their family and ancestors had built up, would get torn apart so easily. Without getting any proper human treatment the government only gave them a day to get packed up and move out of their homes. If someone told me to move out of my home randomly one day and I only had so much time to do it I would be upset too. It is a home that you have spent years of your life or your whole life knowing. Then it gets thrown away practically because you get no profit from moving but a restless lifestyle. Especially if it is a home that has sentimental value and you don't want to get rid of it, plus some people even tried to stand up for themselves. This still didn't work out because everyone was out for themselves and their own benefit. The tractor people did not care if a house was being torn away, they only cared about their own families. I also liked how they showed the family was so untrustworthy when they finally got to the camp. I liked how their characters evolved from being gullible into believing what the government was saying, to processing information and learning from the past what this could mean. I think character growth is important in movies because without it you have nothing to look forward to or anything to be really surprised about. I deducted one point from this movie because it was black and white, which made it unpleasant to the eyes. I also deducted another point because at times I could not understand what they were saying. Sometimes they would say something so quickly I didn't understand a thing and sometimes they just had a strong accent from back in the day.",

They then find that California is not the place they hoped and the film continues with them struggling to survive.This film has become a classic, and is regarded for its portrayal of how hard life was inthe 1930s. Many of us cannot even imagine how brutal it was to live in the era of the GreatDepression.",

As a country we're going through something similar today in many areas. We're moving from an industrial to an information based economy. Industry jobs are being lost to other nations and older and poorer workers are suffering for it. It's progress I guess, but it takes its toll.Some factory worker who has lost his job for any number of reasons can identify to some degree with the Joads, especially if they've lost a home they owned. For the Joads it was worse because they made their living off the land for many generations, identifying with it in a way that industrial workers could not.Henry Fonda got his first Oscar nomination for Tom Joad. To get the part which he knew he was so right for, he signed a studio contract with 20th Century Fox. That caused him many problems later on, but those are stories for another film review.Tom Joad is a midwest country kid, a whole lot like Fonda himself. Part of the story of The Grapes of Wrath is Tom himself trying to figure out why these economic forces are crushing him and his family and the way of life he's known. In the end when he leaves the Joad family and hits the open road, he's not got all the answers, but he's asking the questions. Tom hasn't figured it out, but a lot of people with many letters after their names haven't either. He only knows that he's got to get in the fight for economic justice.Jane Darwell was in films from the earliest silent films to Mary Poppins in 1965. This became her career part and the mother role of all time. She's what holds the Joad family together in good times and bad. That's what moms do and get little recognition for it. Except in this case by the Motion Picture Academy.John Carradine has his career part in this also. Another John Ford favorite, Carradine plays Casy the defrocked preacher who as he tells it disgraced himself with a female parishioner. After that preaching the gospel didn't seem quite right. When Fonda meets Carradine after Fonda's been released from prison, Carradine is asking a lot of questions about what is man's place in the metaphysical scheme of things. He's developing what we would now call situational ethics. Carradine's questions are on a higher plane, but he certainly inspires Fonda to ask for some answers himself.",

East of Eden is another wonderful example of his understanding of pain and , most of all, of love. Henry Fonda was born to play this role. Why he did not win an Oscar for it is amazing. Attempts in later years to remake this epic movie, a waste. Leave perfection alone. Ma Joad, also, cannot, among today's actresses be redone. Perhaps Meryl Streep in another hundred pounds and 30 years. When choosing entertainment for young readers, this movie is one they should be required to see. Sadly, many English classes no longer have required reading. Watching this adaption of Steinbeck is the next best thing.",

            "content": "The film Grapes of Wrath, based off the book by John Steinbeck, depicts a family who lives in Oklahoma around the time the Dust Bowl starts. As times get worse, the family is forced to move off their farm and head west to California to find work that is rumored to be there. This film was obviously very important because it brought to life the struggles of the Midwestern people during the Great Depression and Dust Bowl, which may only ever have been depicted in books or literature in times to date. The film is masterfully made. This film is in black and white but this does not take away from the experience, it actually adds to the theme by using dark shadings to symbolize the struggles and poverty and desperation. The actors do their part well, and make the audience connect with and feel the struggles they went through at the time. Many people know about the history and hardships of the people who lived in the big cities and were directly affected by the stock market crash, but what is less known, is the plight of the farmers who were wiped off their land by the severe drought that also took place during the Depression era. This movie does justice in bringing to life the struggles thousands of people faced. Through all the endeavors, one major quote from the movie sums up the feelings of many Americans at the time.\"We'll go on forever because we're the people.\" The strong and hard-willed matriarch of the family speaks this quote. She is the backbone of the family and she takes care of them the best that she can. She is also very wise and is interested only in the welfare of her family and keeping her family together. In this movie, one of the major life lessons that are spoken to the audience is to always keep moving forward and to never give up. I really love this quote. This was a quote that I already try to live by in my life, and seeing the quote played out in real life is fascinating. Even though this is a movie that was \"Hollywoodnized,\" the struggles that these people went through were real. In real life when the people persevered and never gave up things eventually started to look up. This is a quote every American, especially younger audiences, should try to live by, and this is a movie that is exceptionally well done.",

            "content": "Contains spoilers:\nThis movie was released in 1940 and gives account of a family from Oklahoma during the Great Depression in the early 1930s. The lead character is Tom Joad, played by Henry Fonda. Right after he gets out of prison for homicide, he returns home to his parents' house, only to find that they've been evicted and moved into Tom's uncle's house. A former preacher, Jim Casy, tags along to Uncle John's, and when they decide to all go to California to look for work and earn money, Casy travels with them all. When they start out, there are twelve people traveling in a raggedy-looking truck headed west. But by the near-end of the movie, there's only about 7 people left. Three people died, and two left the crew. The underlying message throughout the movie here is that life is hard, jobs are difficult to come by and keep, and the time they were living in made this family fall apart.I think what made this film such a masterpiece, even though being in black and white, is that there are universal themes that can strike chords with almost everyone. There are \"externally observable truths\" in this movie as well as \"internal truths of human nature,\" as the book calls them. The way things were back in the Great Depression was portrayed to be harsh, where policemen abused their legal authority, jobs were hard to come by, and families often disbanded. On the other hand, the way things should be seemed to only be dreams imagined by the people in the movie, with not many people holding onto the hope of a better future. Hence, this is a perfect explanation of why the Great Depression was called \"The Great Depression.\" In line with the universal themes were the characters and their acting as well as the lighting and screenplay that made this film more than just average and why it was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won two of them. With Henry Fonda leading as Tom and the other characters all being a necessary part of the story, I thought that the acting was above average also. Then add in the lighting of the movie, and with certain scenes the lighting made the difference between a good scene and a great scene. I can see now why this film has gotten so much acclaim for the last eight decades.",

            "content": "After taking a film class you get used to being shown the same scene over and over again before having to tear it apart and examine the fine points of film technique. After watching the entirety of The Grapes of Wrath for the first time in my English class, I considered what I have learned and what gear I have worked with doing filmmaking, even if it was a beginner class. Understanding that in the 1940's, during the Great Depression no less, filmmakers did not have the equipment or technology we have the fortune of using presently, I believe Nunnally Johnson's adaptation of John Steinbeck's classic novel deserves praise for the exceptional cinematography.The camera angles, different shot types, color scheme, and lighting all helped effectively portray the desperate times in which the Joad family lived. The varied shot types are used as the components of storytelling; the close-ups show the raw emotion in Ma and Tom's relationship when they are having conversations, while the panning long shots show the constantly changing settings the jalopy moves through. John Ford's choice to use black and white film versus color film significantly changes the overall appearance of the story; it comes out as dirtier and rougher; the darker side of America.I do hold some narrow-mindedness toward the film seeing as I read the book beforehand. If you are planning to read the book and watch the movie, I recommend you read the book first so as not to confuse yourself when you find the order of events rearranged or missing all together in the movie. Those differences cause the entire message of the movie to shift away from Steinbeck's message in the book, but they had to be done in order for Fox to even allow the movie to be produced. I admit there were so many changes in detail that I was disappointed with the storyline of the film, but overlooking that I still deem this film as a true artistic presentation. John Ford generated an incredible film using the bits and pieces he was allowed from the novel ; he made do with what he had and kept on living, just as the message of the film goes.",

            "content": "This film surely deserved being nominated in the Academy Awards. Steinbeck's message was butchered and the story of the Okies disgraced. These two viewpoints are both fairly accurate in their own respect. Indeed this is very entertaining and captivates its audience, but it also twists the story Steinbeck conveys in his book. Before considering whether or not to view this movie, you first need to know if it is the right match for yourself.Entertainment: If you are searching for the perfect movie to sit back on a Friday night, maybe reminisce in the past, eat some popcorn, enjoy a classic movie, then you should continue reading under heading. This film did deserve being nominated for best film in the Academy Awards. Excellent cinematography and great actors like Henry Fonda and John Carradine set this movie apart and make the audience really feel for the Joads. After losing their family farm, the Joads set out as migrant workers on their way to California. They overcome adversity as the try to get settled and find work, despite the attitudes of the land owners. This is a story of overcoming odds and no matter what happens, staying together as a community, as the people.Compare and Contrast: If you're looking to see how this movie compares to this book and are hoping that it will accurately depict Steinbeck's novel, then turn around. I'm not saying this is a bad movie, it does tell the story of the Joads and shows the problem they are facing, but the way in which the Joads combat this diversity is different between the two works. The beauty of the inner chapters isn't expressed to its full potential in the movie. It's not expected that this can be done, but the effects of the inner chapters is part of what made the novel what it was. In the book, the inner chapters tied the Joads to the entire community and helped set up some context. The movie tells some of the stories of those in the inner chapters, but doesn't give the sense of community that the book has. Along with the lack of sense of community the relationship of the family is not the same between the two entities. In the book the two kinds of families, the Joads and John Davis', are compared. The difference between the two are having the family break up, but have community replace it, or have a family that stays together, but their connection to the community is destroyed. The movie seems to take the stance of Joe Davis' family because the focus is put on the family and the aspects of the family falling apart like Noah's Departure and the Joads connection to their community is downsized. The Joads never meet the Wilsons and the boxcar seen is completely taken out. Also the family farm isn't really shown in detail and there isn't a sense of connection to the agriculture because not a single peach or piece of cotton is shown. This brings me to my next point.Students: If you need to read this book over the summer before going back to school, watch this movie. It seems like a spark note of the book as it summarizes the travels of the family and their hardships. However, if you need to discuss the themes of this book, you might not get a very good grade. The problems of the Joads remain intact, but the solutions of their problems are different. Emphasis is put on the people instead of sacrifice to move forward.This is truly a good movie, but if you are hoping it will reflect the book, you might not enjoy it as much. Personally having read the book myself, I did enjoy this movie and respected it for what it did achieve for its time; however you can't view this thinking that it will be like watching Steinbeck tell his story.",

This is one of those films. Modern day America should never forget the suffering that took place during that desperate time and the events that forged the hardworking American people of the 1930's. Director John Ford has been able to create a work of art that allows the viewers to empathize with migrants in the Great Depression. Henry Fonda, who plays Tom Joad stars in this classic film that follows the Joad family after they get kicked off their land by the owners, as they move towards the \"promise land\" of California in search of a better life. The film portrays many different themes throughout the film such as perseverance and suffering through the pursuit of the American dream. Something the film does exceptionally well is the ability to match a small American family to what hundreds of families were experiencing at the time. Many families that initially watched this film could resonate and empathize with the Joad family story and the accurate portrayal of their story felt as if they were given a voice. A theme that can find empathizers today can be the injustice that the Joad's experienced in the working camps. A pivotal topic in today's society is the perception of injustice that people feel towards authority. So even as a modern day American, there are themes that viewers can resonate with. Visually, the temptation is to write off the film because it is in black and white but I found the lack of color brought other aspects of the film to the forefront, like recurring themes, which made me appreciate the recurring themes in the film. The film was also using technology that was modern at the time so it gives it an authentic feel. Another positive surprise for me was that the acting in the film feels genuine and authentic, which may stem from the fact that at the time of release (1940), the people involved most likely had first hand experience through their own struggles or struggles of people they knew. Overall, I would recommend this as a must watch for people to understand what the Great Depression was like and the film felt authentic to what the story was.",

            "content": "The film Grapes of Wrath was directed by John Ford, produced by Darryl Zanuck, and based on the written work of John Steinbeck.  Some key characters in the film were Tom Joad (Henry Fonda), Ma Joad (Jane Darwell), and Tom's friend Casy (John Carradine).  It was a profound film that showcased the issues of sharecroppers in Oklahoma during the dustbowl years as they faced economic ruin and were forced to flee to California based on flyers that promised work.  Unfortunately, the flyers did not convey accurate information.  The film begins with the character of Tom Joad, recently released from prison returning home only to find his family gone.  When he catches up to his family he learns that the bank has taken over most of the farms and demolished the homes of the sharecroppers.  With no land and no home, Tom and his family start out for California based on information from a flyer that promises plenty of work and with it the promise of a better life.  However, when the Joad family gets there, they find that there are more families than there are work opportunities.  They also initially find harsh conditions at the first migrant camp where they are brutally treated.  Tom sees the harsh and brutal treatment of the sharecroppers as undeserved and inhumane.  Tom's friend Casy is then killed by one of the camp security guards and Tom kills the guard in return.  While initially Tom is not discovered when the other security guards look for him and they move on to a better run government camp where he finds work, those who do not want the migrants in CA start trouble there as well.  At the end of the film Tom needs to leave as the investigation for the deceased security guard comes to the new camp.  The addition of sound to the film (new in the 1930s) really adds to the emotive concept in the film; it particularly comes across in the scene where Tom has a parting conversation with his mother conveying his concern for the families in this dire situation.  I also believe that leaving the film black and white instead of adding color adds to the grave subject matter in the film.  I was very moved by the entire film.",

Ford directed the famous film with Zanuck being the producer, alongside longtime screenwriter, director and playwright Nunnally Johnson. The film is headlined by lead actor Henry Fonda who plays Tom Joad, a son in the Joad family. We start the film with Tom returning from jail to his family in Oklahoma, only to encounter the family farm being taken over by the bank. The Joads, being as frustrated as they are, have a sheer desire to take it up with the people in charge. However they're unable. Luckily enough, at least in my opinion, they find some flyers seeking help in California, \"800 pickers wanted.\" The film is headlined by another massive role in Ma Joad, played by Jane Darwell. Throughout the film, Ma Joad expresses great emotion towards her family. She understands its her job to take care of the family, physically and mentally, and to keep the spirits as high as possible. Ma Joad's role over the entire film gets larger and larger. She turns into a leader over the entirety, taking over Pa Joad's role. It wasn't her job to be the leader, but as she sees the family drifting and complicated circumstances start to take over, she takes it upon herself to keep the family together at all costs. Along the road-trip, we see every characters' true emotions come to life. We see tragedy when the family arrives in Barstow, California and its revealed that Grandma Joad has passed. We see trouble when the family hears that eight-hundred pickers means possibly five-thousand flyers were printed, meaning that the Joad's may never find work in California. Another instance of trouble happens when Tom has to kill yet another person in his life after he's attacked with a club, he then turns it on the man and strikes him to death. One of the greatest aspects of this film however is Tom's character. Tom plays a lead role, but acts as such a simple player throughout the film. Every time he comes on scene the audience just expects something simple, never too much, but never giving us too little. \n\nOverall, the film does a great job of providing the audience with perspective. Through deep emotions and magnificent lead roles, were able to experience the film in the directors eyes. As John Ford takes us on a journey throughout 66, it's hard to take our eyes off of what comes next.\n8/10 recommendation",

The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., the bloody suppression of the Black Panther Party, and the exporting of the values of the rich and powerful in Hollywood transformed \"Black Panther\" from a term that practically led the Black revolution into a high-tech, tight-suited mashing clown in the Marvel universe. Would such a film be made in America today? This is a question worthy of our deep reflection. The films that can cause people's reflection are never famous, but those meaningless Hollywood science fiction films are most sought after by people. The tone of the film is sad and sullen. Although some of the plot or humor, or calm, but can not hide its sadness. At the same time, it has a glimmer of light, leading the audience to expect and imagine the people's rise and struggle. The protagonist Joad is brave and has a fighting spirit. Even as the family flees west, some of the characters leave one by one. But the image of the poor and simple farmer who never gives up is deeply rooted in people's hearts, which is thought-provoking and touching. It can be said that under the harsh environment and arduous tribulations, it also shows a positive and positive transmission to the audience.

            "content": "Grapes of Wrath was a 1940's cinema film directed by John Ford, produced by Darryl F. Zanuck, written by Nunnally Johnson, and based on the book by John Steinbeck. Henry Fonda was cast as the lead role at the height of his career which gave a large pull to audiences through star power. The story follows Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) and his family as they move to California after being forced off their farm during the great depression and dustbowl where they seek out jobs for fair wages to create a life for themselves, but at every turn, something seems to go wrong. Tom Joad and Jim Casey become fast friends while this black and white film had great shots to foreshadow events, such as the lighting and windstorm near the beginning with the preacher before they head to the farm. This movie was made to give a more realistic representation of the struggle of individuals/families the treatment of workers during this time and the labor practiced that was already used during the building of the transcontinental railroad where all the money they earned working went straight back because of the cost of food, clothing, etc. so they remained poor. This film also represented the political activist movement to stop the exploitation of migrant workers how Tom Joad tries to write to earn fair wages but is accused of communism by a police officer. \n\nThis was inspired by Jim Casey (John Carradine) who works to organize the workers.  The film was a great medium for messages to the public because people could see the hardships and empathize with the characters. I highly recommend this movie as an overview of life after the stock market crash and the effects of the great depression. The struggles the family goes through while trying to seek a better life and survive while being ousted by communities where migrant workers tried to settle because they were trying to take jobs from them. In conclusion Grapes of Wrath was an instant classic movie and came at a time when it was most needed to help society deal with the unfair treatment of workers. It also competed against the mainstream entertainment of radio shows, and mafia movies and was something new to cinematography which shows the impact of the film on society with how successful it was. This film adaptation of John Steinbeck's book was done brilliantly and the casting for it worked out rather well with just enough big names to bring people to the movies.",

Darryl Zanuck was the man who produced this film starring Henry Fonda, a big name in the industry. \n\nThe film starts with Tom Joad coming home from prison to his father's 40-acre farm to meet Casy, a man who was previously a preacher. They arrive home to find out the Joads had been forced from their home and had started for California with the rest of the farmers. These farmers had been forced to move by the dustbowl, a significant dust storm that plagued the southern plains in the 1930s. Many farmers chose to seek a better life in California in an attempt to run from the dust bowl and the great depression that clouded the nation. Tom finds this out by talking to Muley, a shaky man who doesn't want to leave his home. Tom brings Casy and reconnects with his large family to start their trip to California. The Joads make it to a refugee camp and earn minimal pay for their physical labor. A strike breaks out in the camp, leaving Casy dead and Tom with blood on his hands, so the Joads pack up and move again. This time coming across a better government camp with better provisions for the family. When the cops eventually come looking for Tom, he is forced to flee and say goodbye to his mother, who kisses him on the cheek as she weeps for her son. \n\nThe film has an overall slow pacing as it works through the story of the Joads family. The dustbowl might have been the cause of the family's move, but the great depression causes the root of the hardships throughout the movie. This makes the film applicable to American troubles today because many parts of the US are still poverty-stricken. Some US cities have neighborhoods that are relatable to third-world countries. Throughout all this, the family can keep a positive outlook on their situation because they see the light at the end of the tunnel in California. I believe the film does a great job of storytelling, which is helped by the fact that it is based on a novel. The actors had good performances that allow you to feel the pain they are going through, and Tom Joad's continuous positivity is admirable. I would recommend this film to an older audience that would enjoy the slow pace. It could also be more relatable for them if they had close relatives who lived through these times. \n\nTo end, I think the movie is an American classic that is a good view into the past of our nation. It allows for thoughtful analysis and makes for a good watch if you have the time.",

This is a story firmly based in people, humanity, and community, following the Joad family as they are displaced from their home in Oklahoma and journey to the promised bountiful lands of California. Their struggles to find work, to go on in extreme hunger, deal with travel, and persevere is not distinctly American, but Ford's script and use of imagery makes it so.\nTom Joad, portrayed by Henry Fonda, is the film's hero and possesses many attributes that would become archetypal to the classic Western leads of film. Fonda does an immensely commendable job leading the film and carries an energy through the lens that embodies old Hollywood stardom. He leads an equally adept cast, yet remains the standout \u2013 perhaps because he is given the most meaty scenes and dialogue. Through heartbreak, loss, and tragedy, the Joads continue on in their great journey West. This story, though fictional, is all too common to resonate in any impacted by the Great Depression or similar economic situations that would follow it. Taking place many years ago, we can see how and when structures were put in place that still put many families in positions like that of the Joads today. Ford creates a melancholy tone of mourning the America that died in this era, while highlighting the common people who worked to endure it and banded together as a community through their exploitation. \nPerhaps one of the most significant scenes comes at the diner when Grandpa takes the children inside to buy what little bread the family can afford (not even a full loaf). The waitress, refuses to sell the bread and says they must purchase a sandwich. Grandpa humbly explains how their budget cannot afford such luxuries and the man behind the counter insists she sell them the loaf for all they can pay. Whilst paying for the loaf, Grandpa asks if that is penny candy for sale \u2013 to which the waitress replies that it is two for a penny. He purchases the candy for the two children and goes on his way. Two truck drivers who have been eating and witness the whole interaction recognize that the waitress lied about the price and leave her the difference so that she was not at a loss. Perfectly scripted, paced, and shot, this scene embodies the spirit of the film and original novel \u2013 to find kindness and empathy for one another in such trying times. It is this sentiment that makes the working class the heroes of the film and the era.",

            "content": "Trials and tribulations of a family trying to rebuild\n\nThe film The Grapes of Wrath was directed by John Ford and based off of a novel written by John Steinbeck. This film begins in Oklahoma better known in the 1930's as the \"Dust Bowl\". The story is of a family that has to leave their long time home due to their not being able to cultivate the land any longer and the land being taken over by a new owner. Despite the sadness that surrounds the family they are also in a sense optimistic as to what is to come when they venture to California. The family is under the belief there will be endless opportunity available to them but getting there proves to be detrimental and taxing. \nMy take on this movie is that it is filled with moments of highs and lows these highs and lows will keep you enthralled throughout the 2 hours you are watching the film. You will form a connection with the main characters as they attempt to find the promise of opportunity in route to California. There are moments where you will be gripped with anger on behalf of the characters because unbeknownst to yourself you will become invested with characters like Casey played by John Carradine and and Tom Joad played by Henry Fonda. Jane Darwell (plays Ma Joad) delivers moments of compassion and worry for her family that will cause you to want to root for the family to succeed during their passage and time in California. \nIf you are looking for a film that is based on American history this film is for you. The film will take you through moments that occurred for people that lived in Oklahoma during the 1930's. You will understand the mix of desperation to ride out the hardship that has befallen the many farmers and not want to let go of land that was pass down generationally. You will also see the determination of a family to seek opportunity as far away as California. The willingness to work for what at the time was a minuscule amount to ensure the family continued to prosper together. This movie will leave you wanting more a sequel so to speak to see what else occurs and comes of the main characters.",

The film is based on this novel. It is starred by Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell and John Carradine, directed by John Ford, and written and produced by Nunnally Johnson and Darryl F Zanuck.\n\nTom Joad, played by Henry Fonda, has just come out of prison. When he returns home, he finds that his home is empty. Later, I learned from Jim Casy, played by John Carradine, that local farmers were forced to leave the land due to industrial development. The two of them and their families are also going to leave their hometown and go to California to find a new job. Unfortunately, on the way, his elderly grandparents died one after another, and Casy was killed. Joad was chased after avenging his friend Casy and had to flee with his family.\n\nAs an excellent director, John Ford vividly shows the scene of farmers going bankrupt and fleeing during the economic panic of the 1930s in the United States that this film needs to show. It deeply reflects the sufferings of the peasants at that time under the persecution of capitalism! It also reflected the turbulence of the social situation in the United States at that time. And the farmers' reluctance to grow up, work, and accompany their land all their lives in the film also makes me empathize. In China, there is an idiom called falling leaves returning to their roots, which means that people hope to return to their hometown when they die or after. The peasants who were expelled in the film died and escaped. I think that as a record of the significance of the westward movement of the United States, the film is very valuable for preserving the pain of every people during the economic depression!",

The supporting plays are great too, and the black and white cinematography emphasises the bleak and desolate wastelands the characters are living in, and the hopelessness of the circumstances they're constantly trapped by. The film often leans too hard into sentimentality, and the runtime is excessive, making it difficult to always give your full attention to. But what the film does well, and what it's so beloved for, is it's honest, uncompromising portrayal of the rural folks who were driven from their homes and lived in abject poverty for so many years. Much effort has been made to show the conditions of The Great Depression as realistically as possible. We see people in ragged clothing, baring dirty faces, standing round a cooking pot hoping for the smallest scrap of food. But along with showing the horrors people had to endure, it also demonstrates mankind's incredible capacity for charity and compassion, even in the darkest of moments. It's not a film I'd rewatch in a hurry, but for its acting, authenticity and message of optimism even when all seems lost, I'm glad I seen it once.",

On their trip to California, they will see how the crisis affected families from all over America and that is not going to be that easy to find a job as they thought.  \n\nDespite the simplicity of the plot, the director John Ford and the producer Darryl F. Zanuck made an excellent job adapting the novel written by John Steinbeck to the big screen. He managed to make me feel the same way as the characters did thanks to the appropriate choice of actors. Henry Foda perfectly suited the role of Tom Joad, a strong character who cares about his family, but the words of Jane Darwell as Ma Joad touched my heart, especially the last speech she gives to Tom before he leaves.  \n\nDorris Bowdon, who interpreted Rose of Sharon, was one of the less experienced performers and she did an excellent job, her face and body expressions were natural, and the acting of Charley Grapewin, grandpa Joad, was spectacular especially at the beginning of the film when he shows his love for his land until the point he wants to stay there forever. \n\nHowever, the course of the film was heavy and everything but dynamic as instead of being one single movie, it looked like small shorts put all together with weak connections, for example, the borders between each state. Moreover, the beginning of the film did not hook me and it was not until the police intervention in the first camp when I started to feel a real interest in the film. \n\nFinally, the visual production was shocking, innovative, and vanguardist. The camera was used as another way of expressing instead of having just a narrative function, for example, when the tractors brought down the houses of the farmers, the camera shows us the shadow of the people on the tracks of the tractors as if they had brought down their lives too. This was joined by the great and adequate soundtrack that boosted the sensations transmitted.  \n\nOverall, I think is worth seeing this movie so I recommend it to everybody, especially to history enthusiasts. The realistic reflection of the old American people along with the amazing shots makes The Grapes of Wrath a unique film.",

Cinematographer Gregg Toland does an excellent job making lighting decisions to match the mood of each scene. Additionally, the film editor, Robert L. Simpson, makes some very interesting editing choices including the decision to blend certain shots together to evoke transitions.    \n            Overall, I highly recommend this film because of its masterful ability to convey a timeless message through a historically significant lens. This film clearly evokes the harsh reality of the time, but the eternal resilience of the Joad family as they encounter obstacle after obstacle sends a message of hope and optimism that is applicable to audiences of any generation. Henry Fonda's performance as Tom Joad is particularly noteworthy; Fonda's commitment and attention to detail render his character extremely believable and relatable. His character seems to represent the Everyman; he starts the film at a literal crossroads, a corner store called \"Cross Roads\", after his release from prison. No matter how hard Joad tries to stay out of trouble, he cannot help but fight for justice, a tough fight when the opposition is society itself. Additionally, Jane Darwell's performance as Ma Joad is thoughtful and moving. As the matriarch of the family, Darwell's character holds the family together. In one memorable scene, Ma Joad burns the possessions she will no longer need before setting out for California. She holds a pair of earrings up to her face for a long moment before hastily stuffing them in her pocket, hopeful that she may have the chance to wear them again one day. \n\tThe Grapes of Wrath is a rare film because of its ability to transcend time and resonate with viewers from the 1940s until the present. The film preserves the historical landscape and social context of the 1930s, while presenting characters who face the hard times and tough choices that face all generations in some form. The Joad family represents all families and, no matter how tough the circumstances, they always persevere.",

I think special mention must got to Jane Darwell as Ma Joad who is the rock of the family and perhaps, more than the others, manages to show the real dignity of the people who found themselves in this terrible situation. The scene where she is deciding which of her pitiful trinkets and keepsakes she has to leave behind is heartbreaking.\nThis is one of the great movies directed by John Ford and both he and Darwell won well deserved Oscars for this movie in 1941.",

The Grapes of Wrath is among one of my favorite novels, and I think Steinbeck is deserving of his place among the greatest authors from America, so to say Ford quickly alleviated any reservations I had about this adaptation is a big compliment. Ford employs the landscape beautifully and, along with the well cast Joad family and supporting characters met in their travels, really does quite well in capturing the essence of Steinbeck's novel in a totally different medium. Some things are definitely changed, most noticeably the ending, but the important general thrust and themes still remain intact and are presented unapologetically.",

This movie and book depict a time in our history a time in our history when families were moving west looking for a better life for themselves and their futures. Our main character Tom Joad ( Henry Fonda) has been paroled for a fight he engaged in resulting in a killing 4 years earlier back home in Oklahoma , but his family is being forced off their family farm by big banks and investors so they decide to move west to California like most families at this time. When I look at some of the themes of this movie I can see some resemblance to the 2008 meltdown with the banks and the mortgage crisis. People were forced out of their homes because of bad lending practices but the banks lived to fight another day with the bail out from the federal government.  Tom Joad was just one story of many of how important having unions are when you have to fight huge corporations. When people with the same goal and like aspirations band together they are able to fight these huge corporations as one. The journey of the Joad family from Oklahoma to California due to the dust bowl ,wiping out farms and corporation buy outs think California is going to answer all their prayers. What they will find when they reach California , just like the millions of other families had the same idea to move west, the opportunities are not as plentiful as they think. They arrive and find they're not wanted and are relocated to a town for all the migrants arriving from the mid-west. Within this town there able to find work but the work is tied to them filling in for workers who have walked off the job. From this they are able to come together form a union and fight for the rights of all workers against landowners.  This movie gave some insight on a part of American history about the great migration from the Midwest to California and how difficult it was for families to move their entire family across the country in search of a better life",

            "content": "The Grapes of Wrath, directed by John Ford, is a 1940's drama about the struggle of a farming family moving west for work. The film was directed by William Wyler, and writing is credited to Nunnally Johnson based on the book by John Steinbeck. The film follows the journey of Tom Joad, played by Henry Fonza, as he returns home after being imprisoned. When he arrives, he finds his home abandoned. He finds former preacher Jim Casey, played by John Caradine, who inform him that his family was forced to move due to the damaged caused by the dust bowl. Tom and Casey rejoin the Joad family, and together they travel west to California to find work. The Joad family is large, including Ma Joad, played by Jane Darwell, Grandpa, played by Charley Grapewin, and many others. On their journey, the family faces many hardships that test their ability to persevere. \n\nWhen I sat down to watch the Grapes of Wrath, I wasn't sure what to expect. I don't frequently watch black and white film, and when I do its often just Christmas movies. After watching the film, I can say I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was fascinating to learn more about a time long past. When the Grapes of Wrath was released, the Dust Bowl was a recent tragedy, fresh in the mind of those who had struggled through it. But now, the vast majority of those who lived through the Dust Bowl have passed on. The Grapes of Wrath helps bring a face to this tragic area of history. The film does an excellent job capturing the length and difficulty of the Joad's journey. The portrayal of the Joad's vehicle helped emphasize how difficult their journey was. Throughout the movie, the vehicle looked ready to collapse but still kept going. At points, it would look like it was about to tip, but barely stays upright. I felt that this really helped show how overburdened the Joad's vehicle was. The film helps emphasize the distance of the trip with shots showing large swaths of the rugged southwest countryside. Seeing how small the vehicle was in comparison to the land helped highlights the enormity of the trip.\n\nAnother key aspect of the Grapes of Wrath is it's look into worker's rights issues that were prominent at the time. The film takes a strong stance in support of worker's rights. This is an issue that was very personal to the cast of this film. I imagine that having the opportunity to be a part of this commentary was very motivational to the cast, and helped lead to the amazing performances found in this film. \n\nI would highly recommend you watch the Grapes of Wrath, even if you don't regularly watch black and white films. I felt very attached to the Joad family during their trip, and had a glimpse into a time long past.",

The classic film was directed by John Ford who actually won an Oscar for his skills as being such an amazing director whom captured reality, comedy and heart-breaking emotions all into one film. However, John Ford would not have been able to direct such an incredible film without such talented actors. Jane Darwell, who plays Ma Joad, where she exemplifies strength and love for her family. Jane Darwell also won an Oscar for her role in The Grapes of Wrath, for best supporting actress. However, the main character of the film is Tom Joad, played by Henry Fonda. Tom Joad's role in this movie is to fight for change when it comes to social justice. \n\nThe film begins with Tom Joad being released from prison making his way back to his family and home town in Oklahoma. However, when he arrives nothing is the same. The Joad family, along with many other families residing in the area have been forced to leave their property by landholders. The Joan family have decided to migrate to California because they have heard that there is work there. However, the the grandparents of the Joad family become extremely ill resulting in the grandfathers death on the road to California, and the grandmother passing away once they arrive in California. This is definitely a huge part of the film because it expresses the lack of health care during the Great Depression. Once the Joad's arrive in California at a migrant camp, it is nothing what they expected it to be. They make their journey to different migrant camps just to run into more trouble. However, Tom actually finds work and is inspired to keep fighting for social justice. Ma ends the film by expressing fear but at the same time being hopeful that they will never be wiped out and that the people will they will go on forever. \n\nThis film was very eye-opening and emotional to me because it truly expressed what Americans were facing during the Great Depression. I've never really watched a film like this before which made me truly realize how much society has changed. However, many of the obstacles the Joad family faced, many Americans are still currently facing those same problems. I believe that John Ford was an incredible director. Even though we are much more technologically advanced in the film industry now, I had to adjust to a different era of film. Overall, I believe the cast was incredible and truly was able to portray all different kinds of emotions. I really understand now why this film is considered an American classic.",

One of the many incredible things that the film manages to do is adapt the powerful John Steinbeck novel, which won the Pulitzer Prize, without losing any of the subtle detail that makes the story so devastating. Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell give some of the greatest performances I have ever seen as they express all of the internal pain of their characters through facial expressions and small gestures, they're better than almost any actor working today and 79 years later they still appear brilliant. I felt a deep sadness and compassion for those who faced this historical tragedy with absolutely no support and this film explains why social change was needed in the United States during this time period better than almost any social issues focused picture.\n\nThe Joad family, led by adult son Tom Joad, Henry Fonda, and Ma Joad, Jane Darwell, are forced to leave their family farm in Oklahoma and travel to California as a result of the Dust Bowl. They face a grueling journey along Route 66 as they are following thousands of other Okies and Arkies with the same problems and experience the deaths of the oldest members of their families. They find respite at a camp but this may not be enough as it implied that the camp is communist based and when preacher Jim Casy, John Carradine, a family friend who has joined them on their journey, comes into conflict with the police there are disastrous consequences.\n\nThis film takes a large scale tragedy that hurt so many people and caused major social upheaval and tells this story through the lives of a few ordinary, well written characters whose lives are irreparably changed by the Dust Bowl. The supportive, unflappable matriarch and the flawed but hopeful son are common archetypes in film but here they feel real and fleshed out because we spend time with them and see in their everyday interactions who they really are. It helps that director John Ford is an expert at capturing little moments in people's lives that are more revealing than any big, emotional scene. I was connected to this family and desperate to see them prosper despite their circumstances.\n\nHow Fonda's performance didn't earn him the Academy Award for Best Actor I don't understand, obviously the Academy get more wrong that right but this is one of the best performances by an actor I have ever seen. The complex emotions that pass over his faces even if only for a short moment reach out and pull you into his story as he is the emotional center of the film. Darwell was rewarded for her performance with the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award and the quiet strength and morose commitment that she displays will forever be in my mind. I was invested in Tom and Ma Joad because Darwell and Fonda made them feel so fully realized and I held on to them even as the film's credits played and the illusion was broken.\n\nJohn Ford primarily worked as a director of Westerns, a genre that I'm not particularly fond of, and although I've seen The Searchers (1956) and Stagecoach (1939) I would call this my favorite of the films he has directed. He has such a clear vision for the film as we get classic Ford shots that capture the landscape and scenery that have made these people's lives so rough. Ford is gifted with a great screenplay from Nunnally Johnson that brings the story and characters to life better than in say My Darling Clementine (1946). Ford deserves to be considered one of the greatest directors of all time even if only for this film because it is such a marvel of cinematic excellence.\n\nI would rank this highly if I were ever to create a Top 100 Films list and I think it deserves to have a large audience not just because of it's importance but because it is a well made, genuinely moving film that is a testament to the power of film in it's ability to express the anguish of a whole generation.",

The traveler that tells him this explains that is because the owner of the land is trying to get extremely cheap labor, and by having thousands show up, he can offer an unreasonably low pay; assuming the most desperate will still accept the work. This discussion ends in an argument, and the Joad family decides to ignore the man\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s story. The Joads continue traveling until they reach a farm looking for work with a campgrounds of other Oklahoma folk living out of their cars and tents with entire families. As they enter they get an odd feeling about the owners and the local police. People are treating extremely poorly, and offered horrible pay for picking fruit. Some of the people protest and want to organize a strike. One evening Tom goes for a walk after dinner, only to find Jim talking to other people under a bridge.

The main character in the movie is Tom Joad, played by Henry Fonda, who is released from the penitentiary and looking forward to seeing his family after four years of being away.  To his surprise, he learns that his parents, Ma and Pa Joad, along with other family members and neighbors, were forced to leave the homes they had lived and farmed over 50 years by wealthy bank owners.  When Tom reunites with his family, he further learns about a handbill soliciting Pickers in California.  The story line is about the family's journey from Oklahoma to California and the arduous challenges they encounter throughout their travels.  Yet, in their quest to reach what they envisioned as 'The Promise Land and The Land of Milk and Honey', they set out with high hopes and the prospect of turning around their dreaded fate in Oklahoma City for beautiful and luscious lands in California.  In addition to challenging, the travels of the Joad family and others migrating to California proved to be fatal.  Notwithstanding, they maintained their faith and prospect of securing full time employment upon arrival.  Adversity was short-term in their minds.  However, little did they know that they would find that 'The Promise Land and The Land of Milk and Honey' which they envisioned would be threatened by the socialites and people in power in California.  The Joad Family wanted to work and earn an earnest living.  Yet, despite their well-intentions to be great citizens, they experienced difficulties finding work, putting food on the table, and pursuing a little piece of the American dream because they were not welcomed nor wanted in the migrant-filled state of California.  Great film which one a Pulitzer-Prize.  Appropriate for all family members to watch.  Film is black and white.  Very simple to follow and understand movie.  Difficult at times to watch the challenges of this family and migrant friends.  It is a humbling experience we can all learn from which occurred during the Great Depression of the 1930s.

The movie focuses on the perspective of our protagonist, Tom Joad, and how he and his family survived misfortunes caused by the Dust Bowl. Their home was taken away  as the bank repossesses their land, their only choice being to get in their truck and cross the desert for hope. Living through the Great Depression the family couldn't avoid the natural disaster by investing into any industrial equipment to keep their land and they were forced to abandon their land/business. The film captures the family's agonizing uncertainty while they look for hope in California. It wasn't the only family looking for hope though, reason why jobs and food were limited. The people in California did not welcome the migrants and they called them the \"Okies\". They were put in camps and starved. One camp, \"Hoovervilles\" named after the President who many considered the one responsible for causing the Great depression. This movie takes a closer look on the reality lived during the Great Depression. Tom Joad is portrayed by Henry Fonda whose performance was nominated for an Oscar. The movie was directed by John Ford and produced by Darryl. F Zanuck, while screenplay was written by Nunnally Johnson that focused on the whole journey of the Joad family. To sum up I highly recommend this movie because it is the closest we can go to relate to the people living through the Great Depression. The film captures the family's sorrow and the agonizing uncertainty endured along their journey in search for opportunity in the west. While the family was searching for hope in California some members of the family die off or left on the way, while Ma Joad tries really hard to keep the family together. On the other hand, Tom begins to perceive a new vision for humanity.",

From there, they head back home to Oklahoma to find their farm overrun by tractors and bought out by large banks.  After coming home to this disaster, Tom, his family, and Casey decide to head west for California in hopes of a better life.  Unfortunately, they only have one vehicle so all twelve of them pack in for the trip.  Along the way, before arriving in Texas, Tom\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s grandpa has a stroke and dies.  Once in Texas, their car breaks down and needs a new engine.  After getting the car fixed for a cheap price, they continue on their journey.  They made a pit stop in Arizona where Noah, Tom\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s brother stays behind, shortly afterward Tom\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s grandma dies as well.  With heart break from leaving his brother and his grandmas passing, they continue onward toward California.  Once in the \u00ef\u00bf 1/2prosperous\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2? state in a town called Hooverville, Connie, Tom\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s brother-in-law, runs away.  Tom believes the town is not safe, so he and his family move onward to Weedpatch, a place heard to have work.  Once there, Tom is the only one who could find a job which was digging ditches, shortly afterward they all migrate to Hooper Ranch due to the lack of work available for everyone.  Upon arrival, Tom unities with Casey, only for a short while until he was killed which caused Tom to kill a man.  In suspicion of Tom getting arrested, they again leave Hooper Ranch to go to a place for workers to pick cotton.  That too only last a short time due to Ruthie accidentally telling someone Tom killed a man.  Tom then leaves but assures everyone that he will continue Casey\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s dynasty in creating unions and bettering the conditions for workers.  Toward the end of the story, the family ends up leaving the cotton-picking sanctuary aside from Al and his new wife Agnes.  Upon their departure, they come across a barn with a son and dying father with an illness.  Rosa Sharon breast feeds the man until he recovers from the illness and recovers well from the treatment. \n\n\nProduction highlights (positive or negative):\n\nThe overall message is trying to shine a light on migrant workers, work conditions, and unjustified low wage pay.  The really cool part about this story is that it was written in the 1930\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s but still stands true today, especially in regard to the unjustly low wage pay. \n\n\nOverall Recommendation:\n\nIt is an absolute classic however, I would not recommend unless you have time to spare or you work in the art/film industry. \n\n\nConclusion: \n\n Great story, great message, I could have lived without seeing this movie due to the fact that my work or personal life does not evolve around art or film at all.",

There was not a moment in which the standard lagged, and this made watching the movie a pleasant experience in which one could take the directing for granted, and therein be more attentive to the storyline. Additionally, the cinematography aided in conceptual aspects of the film. Moments such as the opening gesture of the movie sparked my interest, in that it showed, with much purpose, the vast and barren landscape with man coming out of it to greet man. This moment, as well as several others, provided one with the sense that nature was empowered and man was living in its domain, rather than the opposite.\n\nFor the most part, I found comfort in Nunnally Johnson's writing. I enjoyed the pauses taken to provide moments of solace, in story and reflection. Additionally, I enjoyed the contrasting short revealing bursts of information, such as when Tom Joad, played by Henry Fonda, departed the bus and stated simply \"Homicide.\" I found this to provide a comfortable balance between tender and informative moments.\n\nI found acting in a multitude of secondary roles to be both dispassionate and unintentional. In these instances, this disapassion was accompanied by the kind of presentational acting that was prevalent in this era. I had trouble overall finding a real effort being put into accents. \n\nI found much comfort in the acting of Henry Fonda. He possessed a great presence, due to his very thoughtful and intentional acting. What I found to be really spectacular, especially for this era, was the fluidity and organic quality in his motions and speech. His unique and consistent body language made for a cohesive performance that I was very pleased with.\n\nI was very surprised by how gripping this movie was, due to Henry Fonda's exceptional acting and the work of John Ford and Darryl Zanuck. I would recommend this film to anyone!",

            "content": "The Grapes of Wrath is a film from 1940 directed by John Ford, written by Nunnally Johnson, starring Henry Fonda, and based on the novel written by John Steinbeck. The Grapes of Wrath is an emotional film focusing on the Joad family, a family of farmers moving out west to California from Oklahoma. The Joad family is pictured trying to make an honest living in the hard-economic times for many, especially farmers. The story gives insight to the struggles many people had to go through to make a small living and the unfairness they met from employers and those with power including law enforcement. Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad the main protagonist. His performance was inspiring. Henry Fonda perfected his role and you could feel his emotion throughout the whole movie. Each of the tough decisions that Tom Joad had to make felt like they had real weight thanks to Henry Fonda. The film gives a mature outlook to the battles of good vs evil/corruption, some of which we still see in our country today. The Grapes of Wrath really caused me to take a step back to appreciate the laws and regulations we have in place for our work force today. While there are still injustices some experience in today, The Grapes of Wrath helps you to remember there are always those willing to fight and do what is right no matter the cost. My biggest critic for the film is that during times of sadness, loss, or death it wasn't as profound as it could have been. I felt it was under played at a times where some films can go overboard. In conclusion, this isn't a typical film that I would normally watch, but I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would. I can see why this film has earned the praise of many critics and audiences. For a film created in such early times it is impressive that they were able to create a film that is still relevant today. While I don't see myself watching this film again or recommending this film to people as a highly entertaining film. I would recommend this movie to anyone wanting more insight to the history of depression or anyone looking for the very best of American classic film.",

            "content": "In \"The Grapes of Wrath\", the 1940's film adaption of Steinbeck's classic novel, director John Ford tragically illustrates the dissolution of the American dream of Western settlement amidst the Dust Bowl of the 1930's. The story centers around Tom Joad, who returns from jail after four years on parole, only to find his parent's house abandoned due to unrelenting dust storms. Tom reunites with his family at his Uncle John's house, but the group is soon evicted from their farm by the land owners. \n\nThe rest of the film chronicles the journey of the Joad's, an eight person family of sharecroppers, who are now forced to travel west. The family sets their eyes towards California, urged on by labor pamphlets which promise thousands of well paying agricultural jobs to those willing to make the trek. With all of their belongings packed into the family truck, the Joad's and former town preacher Jim Casey head westward in search of a new life. Along the road, the family faces heart-wrenching circumstances that faithfully depict the struggles of the rural poor during the 1930's. \n\nFrom a directorial standpoint, Ford excels in capturing the spirit of the downtrodden American settler. Working alongside cinematographer Gregg Toland, Ford employs a variety of wide-lens landscape shots to convey the scale and gravity of the midwestern plains. In doing so, Toland and Ford create a visual backdrop that begins to symbolize the burden of the rural poor. As the plot develops, the inhospitable country serves to reinforce the severity of their working class struggle. Throughout the film, Toland utilizes low lighting to add to the depressing tone of the movie. During night scenes, Toland employs candle like lighting to envelop the actor's faces in shadow. As a result, the family's circumstances feel more tragic during dialogue. Pinned against such dark and overwhelming visuals, the Joad's feel especially helpless in their quest for California. \n\nThe movie was produced by Darryl Zanuck of Twentieth Century Fox, whose prior films at Warner Brothers often depicted the struggle of the working class during the Great Depression. Nunnally Johnson's well adapted script serves as a homage to the resilience of the everyday man, despite some minor alterations to the language from Steinbeck\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s novel. Johnson's script is brought to life by moving performances from Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell, John Carradine and Charley Grapewin. \n\nServing as the film's lead, Henry Fonda does an excellent job depicting Tom Joad's transformation from a headstrong ex-convict to a man overwhelmed by the reality of his living situation. By the end of the film, Tom Joad leaves his family behind to fight against the injustice he perceives in the world around him. Fonda's careful attention to dialogue allows the viewer to fully invest in Tom Joad's character as a victim of his time and an eventual symbolic hero of the working class. Fonda's final speech serves is a poetically delivered homage to the resilience of the common man.\n\nAdditionally, Jane Darwell shines as Ma Joad, the family matriarch. A personal highlight of the film is Ma Joad's final goodbye to the family house, as Darwill silently but expressively portrays the sadness of leaving her former life behind. Furthermore, Darwell's final speech serves as a perfect conclusion to an otherwise gloomy film, as Ma Joad reasserts the resilience of the working class despite the crushing circumstances they face. John Carradine charismatically portrays John Casey, the former town preacher, who has lost his faith at the beginning of the movie. As the plot unfolds, Carradine glows as a glimmer of hope and redemption amidst the darkness around him, aided tremendously by his expressive acting.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this film as a poetic commendation to the working class spirit. The film is at often times tragic, but the conclusion of Ford's movie will leave attentive viewers inspired. Modern viewers may be bored by the film's slower pacing, but I believe those willing to give the film a full viewing will be more than rewarded. Viewers may benefit from some prior  contextual knowledge regarding the dustbowl to augment the reality of the Joad's situation, but the film certainly holds its own without this. The Grapes of Wrath holds up as a classic homage to the downtrodden after all these years.",

Zanuck, is set in Oklahoma and depicts the terrifying struggles in surviving the Dustbowl.  It was originally a book written by John Steinbeck in 1939 that turned into a movie later on.  This movie is centered around the Joad family, who lost their house to the bank and embark on a journey for a better life. They set out to California, where they hear there are ample job opportunities. Along the way they endure many hardships such as: deaths, fights and having to constantly steer clear of the police. Once they arrive in California, a better future is the last thing they will find. However, through everything they stick together and support each other, which makes it clear to readers that the importance of family is one of the main themes of this film.\n\n The characters in the movie are played brilliantly. We have Tom Joad, who is introduced first in the movie. He was recently released from jail (after four years) and joins his family just in time as they go to California. Through his time in jail, he has adopted a different mindset where he focuses on the present moment. We also have Ma Joad, who is extremely strong and able to face any problem head on and Pa Joad, who is a bit weaker than his wife. He is constantly looking up to her for solutions to the many problems the family struggles with throughout the film. Two other important key players are Jim Casey, a former preacher, and Rose of Sharon.  She is Ma and Pa\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s oldest daughter and ends up being left behind by her husband and giving birth to a dead baby. \n\nIn some of the best shots of the movie, the audience gets to see how terrible these natives live. The dry dusty land, dilapidated houses, disgusting camps and terrified faces all help to paint a picture of pain and misery.  The camera captures the pure turmoil and fear in the character\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s eyes, which is very effective in showing the audience how hard it was to survive through this. I would describe the film as very convincing. The director definitely got across the message he wished the audience receive. I can say, that one will better understand the importance of family and lifting each other up after seeing this movie. The depiction of real-life fear and feelings are still prominent today, especially the element of social injustice by police officers. This movie, although it has a little bit of comic relief, is mostly meant for people to understand that people not only had to live through this, but that they barely survived.",

This film really captured the essence of what families were going through during this time period. The dialogue between characters felt normal. When characters would talk between each other for a regular conversation, you felt like you were there. You could hear the happiness in their voices and the genuine sadness and hopelessness that the Joad family experienced. Henry Fonda as Tommy, Jane Darwell as Ma, and Russell Simpson as Pa, along with the rest of the cast, all did an incredible job at portraying the struggles, hopes, and disappointments of the Joad family. Their acting, combined with the directing, sets, and sound effects made the viewer empathize with the family on screen. In 1940, America was just coming out of the Great Depression. This film related the book, the Grapes of Wrath, to what the American people were feeling. During the Great Depression, families were homeless, had a hard time feeding their families, and couldn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t find jobs. This film became relatable. The Joads were forced out of their home they had known for so long and went to California in hopes to find reliable work. Through the film you see the family struggle, have hope, and get disappointed. In the end, the viewer feels somewhat hopeful, but not too hopeful; which is something the American people likely experienced when this film was released. This was a simple story. Nothing overly crazy happens throughout this film. It\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s simply a story of an American family trying to make ends meet during a difficult time in America. Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell, Russell Simpson, along with the rest of the cast, in combination with the director, writer, producer, and others that contributed to the film, made this simple story not boring, but relatable. This film is not like the ones today with a lot of action, mystery, drama, and comedy. This film simply took the story of the Joad family and made it relatable to the rest of the American people. It is a story that is still relevant for today, and will forever be a historical turning point for the film industry.

I am totally rooting for this family because these two make me care about them. They are given the unforgiving task of delivering some heavy-handed monologues at the end, but it never came across as insincere, which had to be tough. \n\nWhile I realize this movie isn't based on a history book, I appreciated the strong historical feel of the story. These specific things probably didn't happen exactly as shown, but I thought the feel of that time was captured perfectly. There were things that they experienced that did happen back in those days, and trials that wrecked thousands of lives back then. \n\nRating and ranking films like The Grapes of Wrath is a challenge for me. On the one hand I see some real quality and care that went into the film. I see good acting and a well-crafted story. But on the other hand, it's just not enjoyable. I feel the struggle with the characters and I don't like it. So take my rating and ranking with a big grain of salt...",

            "content": "Where do I even begin on this movie? Since it was made in the 40s I can't complain that it was boring at parts. The way you review a movie made 76 years ago is you imagine you're in that year and put yourself in the place of a person watching the movie when it came out and then review it. After thinking about that it is pretty clear that this is a good movie. The acting was very believable and not once I thought that these are just actors. I felt like that they were really who they are and this is just us watching what was happening.\n\nI always felt bad for the family when something bad was happening to them. I just hoped that nothing else bad would happen to them. Many of the characters made me laugh in parts of the movie and it wasn't because of something went wrong or the screenplay was bad. It was that they were making a joke and it hit the right note. Looking at it in today's society I laughed a lot more in this than in a lot of the comedies now on tv and movies. That's something that today's movies lack is a touch of realism, you can tell it's a movie now and it's just for mindless fun and enjoyment. But a movie like this was made to have effect on people's lives and mean something. It stands out more than many movies from this decade.\n\nI knew that life during the great depression is bad but I could have never imagined it being like this. I've seen the first half of Cinderella man and know how bad it was to live in the city and to lose your job. But this is the first time I got to see what it was like for the farmers. Even though this movie is not based to a true story , it's like this is what actually happened to people in this decade. What happens to people in this time was terrible and in a way, this movie made justice for all of those people whose story was never told.",

Although the film itself is in black and white, the screenplay was written entirely in purple (as in purple prose) and and feels like the writers were trying to fill a minimum word requirement for an essay than create a realistic dialogue . The majority of the characters speaks almost entirely in deep, meaningful, almost shakespearean monologues that convey the same general messages over and over and over again, and destroy any sense of genuineness. Despite being poor/lower middle class farmers from Oklahoma, they all speak as if they are high school english teachers attempting to convey their superior vocabulary to a room full of students. And every speech is almost the exact same thing every time too, regardless of who is saying it. You could swap out one character's lines of dialogue in this films for another's, and not notice the difference. The only scrapes of character development in the film only serve to highlight the fact that these really aren't characters at all, merely shells created to stuff more dialogue and symbolism into, making them more fountains of pretentious rambling than anything else. The only two characters who at all speak differently from the rest, have different mannerisms or have different opinions or ways of solving problems, are killed, one of them being the father, who is at nearly the very start of the families journey.  In the end, the film becomes more boring and eye-rolling pretentious  than it does involving or heart wrenching because none of the main characters feel real enough to care about, and the story itself serves more to highlight its author's self-perceived flawless sense of morality than to highlight the struggles of real people.",

Henry Fonda is suitably rebellious as Tom Joad, the kid just back from prison who has to pack up with his family (11 all told) and navigate the route and the perils upon it.  So, it's a road movie of sorts, but the real drama takes place in the Golden State when their hopes and dreams are dashed. Director John Ford chose his character actors well (they are not all recongizable stars) and cinematographer Gregg Toland uses light beautifully both on location (particularly in the desert) and on the studio sets. Yet, for all the realness infused here, you can't forget this is a prestige picture, as the flow of things comes to a sudden halt every now and again when one of the players let loose with a hefty chunk of text from John Steinbeck's source novel.  Fonda gets the meatiest quotes (\"Wherever you can look - wherever there's a fight, so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there...\") but the picture ends nobly with Ma Joad's (Jane Darwell) \"We are the people\" speech, apparently producer Zanuck's idea against John Ford's wishes for a more downbeat ending.  But how downbeat can you get?  That said, I reckon the actual reality for folks at that time was harsher and less cinematic.  For all their attempts to p a collective solution to the problems of poverty and exploitation by the owning classes, Steinbeck and Ford wound up being investigated by HUAC (even though Ford was a noted conservative).

It's a bleak plea for work and the rights of the common people, yes, but a cinematic marvel as well, with Gregg Toland perfectly capturing the wide open spaces and sparse civilization of depression era America, and John Ford's ingenious use of candle light as the sole light-source in night-time scenes. Too often, movies from this era tend to show their over-pressed message with age, but the deep focus on its characters, brilliant performances and the stern writing give The Grapes of Wrath an immediate impact that'll never fade.",

            "content": "Based on one of the most famous novels of all time, I didn't know what to expect from The Grapes of Wrath but as a fan of Peter Fonda's acting I was more than happy to check it out.\n\nIn the 74 years since the release of The Grapes of Wrath, it still maintains the importance of its themes because of all the humanity. Although the story in The Grapes of Wrath dates back as far as 1939, it presents a society which has been forced to endure many of the same things under a society which is beginning to collapse in terms of democracy where people have been forced to look out for themselves and each other without the expectation that there will be someone there to do it for them. The theme is prevalent in the real world, and it reflects a lot of everyday life which has been placed into a different context, and it constantly has themes of optimism about the determination to keep going in the pursuit of happiness and the search for the American Dream. A story like the one in The Grapes of Wrath does not get old because it is constantly prevalent throughout society, and it reveals the way that we as people have to stand for who we are and what we do instead of waiting around for the world to change on its own. The optimism is consistent in The Grapes of Wrath, and it encourages viewers to go out and help to make the world a better place, so its themes are all important and easy to feel a connection to. The Grapes of Wrath proves simply to be a thoroughly compelling feature, even though it is a  very slowly moving one which runs for a rather long runtime and the fact that it doesn't really have too much to do a lot of the time.\nIf you can tolerate waiting around for The Grapes of Wrath to move along, you should be able to find it to be a compelling film which has characters that are easy to sympathise for simply because they are human beings who are facing adversity but have banded together to succeed as a team. The Grapes of Wrath is great because it touches upon themes of both independence and looking out for each other and reveals how both are key to a person's survival in a situation like The Great Depression. Really, The Grapes of Wrath is a great examination of humanity above all.\nVisually, The Grapes of Wrath is terrific because it is full of a lot of really strong visual aspects incorporated in by director John Ford who in his Academy Award winning role as director manages to prove once again that he has a keen eye for grand visuals. He constantly keeps the film rolling through visual excellence thanks to giving a lot of thoroughly convincing costumes and art direction to the film against the backdrop of its dry scenery and it is all captured with great cinematography which is filmed well enough to capture the large spectacle of the story. John Ford treats the story as he has treated many of his western films, and he gives it the same kind of visual quality which allows the film to develop a naturally rough edge. John Ford is a great choice as the director of The Grapes of Wrath, because as well as ensuring that the film is a visual spectacle he gives the story the right treatment so that none of its drama is degraded in the transfer from paper to the cinematic screen. Although the story is changed around a bit and it isn't as deep as its source material, for what it's worth The Grapes of Wrath does manage to capture the spirit of the novel and John Ford manages to take advantage of the chance to adapt it to the cinematic screen by bringing along a script that stays sufficiently true to its source material and visual elements that can only come from a director who has an appreciation for them. \nFrankly, The Grapes of Wrath stays true to the material of the classic novel that it is based on and manages to prove itself as a firm and mostly entertaining adaptation. And on top of it all, John Ford ensures that a perfect cast is lined up so that The Grapes of Wrath reaches its true potential.\nHenry Ford is the ideal actor for the role of Tom Joad in The Grapes of Wrath. Easily capturing the persona of a character who is very likable and sympathetic, Henry Fonda manages to load his lead performance in The Grapes of Wrath with natural charisma. Interacting with the other cast members as if he genuinely cares for them and speaking his words with serious thought, passion and wisdom behind them, Henry Fonda gives an exceptional lead performance in The Grapes of Wrath. The heart in him isn't over the top, it is simply in the way that he says he words with true love for them. And it is one of his greatest performances to date which earned him a well-deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Henry Ford is an absolutely perfect casting decision for the lead in The Grapes of Wrath, and he makes it thoroughly compelling all throughout.\nJane Darwell also gives a really compelling performance because of the fact that she reminds us how family looks out for each other, being the caring matriarch of the Joad Family on their journey. Russell Simon and John Carradine do their part as well.\n\nSo despite being a film which is slow and long, none of the themes in The Grapes of Wrath mean any less today than they did back in 1940 and it is so thoughtful that its message carries itself over until today, as well as the fact that it has John Ford's keen eye for strong imagery and Henry Fonda's immense acting skill as a source of benefit.",

            "content": "I think a lot of people may be expecting one of my longer reviews for this one but I am going to try and make it shorter, because there isn't much to say except that this is a masterpiece (and although there is a change of tone at the end, and some censorship of the book, I understand why it was necessary because of the time), and mostly I will just offer my counter to a couple of common complaints people wrongly have about this movie. \r\n\r\nI think the biggest complaint I ever see is how the movie re-arranges the order of the migrant camps and censors some important parts of the book (such as the woman breatfeeding the sick man) but I have to say that given the time it was understandable. Also, it was John Ford's take on Grapes of Wrath and while Steinback's book was a masterpiece (and yes better than the film) this movie is also a masterpiece in its own way. Yes, the ending is more optimistic but it rings much of the same message that the novel yielded, it was just made more subtle and more hopeful, which again given the time it was made I can see why it was necessary. That being said, that makes me very open to the re-make that Spielberg is doing for the novels 75th anniversary because it can adapt the book and not feel like a remake of this movie. The book and film for Grapes of Wrath are different, but they are both still powerful, impactful, and bring the same important, timeless themes. \r\n\r\nAnother complaint I have heard (not often) was they thought the acting was bad, and the best thing to say is that they clearly haven't watched much film from this era. A lot of the older, classic films are done in a different acting style (You can make an exception with Citizen Kane) and filmed differently than they are today, and for an important reason. The acting that you see in many classic films, such as Grapes of Wrath, is done much closer to stage acting and putting on a recording a stage like play without the limitations a stage play has. Eventually, with movies like Citizen Kane (which is why this movie is so important) you see filmmakers learning they aren't limited like you are on stage and they can provide a much more realistic approach to the story that a stage play couldn't because of its restrictiveness. Even if you don't have this knowledge of why the acting seems weird to you (it's a different acting style, a different style does NOT make the acting bad) it's fairly to realize that the performances in this movie are fantastic, they are iconic, powerful, and continue to be remembered and watched to this day. \r\n\r\nNow I am going to take a brief moment to talk about what makes this film so powerful (since this is a movie review I won't touch on the book that much, but the book is just (actually probably more) as impactful) and it has to be that the movie completely depicts the era, it may be fictional but the migrant workers were not fictional, what they went through was not fictional, and the themes showed the importance for the migrant workers to keep their dignity. The film shows how man will turn against man when he has fear of losing his power and that one of the greatest struggles at the time was not the Dustbowl, but the corruption of the few in power to stop others from ever being able to obtain anything, even if it meant having the thousands upon thousands starve or be beaten and die. Another important thing to note is many of those migrant camps shown in this movie were REAL migrant camps, there were many families that went through what the Joads went through, the movie depicted exactly how corrupt the powerful could actually get (in one of the more wealthy countries) and how they would (and did) treat the thousands in need like complete dogs because of the fear of losing any power. \r\n\r\nI went a little longer with this review than I actually intended (I did not want to write an essay for this, to many people have analyzed this film and book enough to where I can't really contribute much more) but Grapes of Wrath is a powerful movie, with many impactful themes that continue to resonate in importance today as they did 70 years ago, it is a timeless classic that will never die. 10/10",

I'll be there too.\"\r\n\r\nFor a time, it was known as the greatest film of all-time, before it was beaten by the overrated Citizen Kane. Based on the classic and controversial novel by John Steinbeck, The Grapes of Wrath is deserving of the greatest film title and is possibly one of the most powerful films a person can witness.\r\n\r\nDuring the Great Depression, Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) returns home to Oklahoma after spending jail time only to find that The Dust Bowl has consumed their crops and the lack of profits has forced them to leave their homes. Tom and his family load up and head to the \"land of milk and honey\", that is, California, to try to find work and live a better. What they learn the hard way is that the grass isn't always greener on the other side.\r\n\r\nThe film also features Jane Darwell in an Oscar-winning performance as Ma Joad, Russell Simpson as Pa Joad, John Carradine as Jim Casey, a former preacher who joins the ride, and Doris Bowden plays the family's pregnant girl.\r\n\r\nThe Grapes of Wrath, both the book and this film, have been the subject of controversy since its original release, especially in the political crowd. The \"right\" politicians accuse it of going too far to the \"left\" while others accuse it of promoting communism. Fans of the book have also criticized the film for changing the ending to make it a little happier. When it comes to watching movies, I don't watch a movie to analyze a director's political views or the whole political message of the story; I watch a movie to escape political problems and have a good time. For The Grapes of Wrath, this experience paid off, and I experienced a drama that's very powerful to watch.\r\n\r\nNow I never experienced the Great Depression personally, but with this film, I can fully understand why it's called a great depression. Farmers being kicked out of their homes cause they don't have enough crops, coming to California to find a better life only to be accused of communist strikers. It's a very depressing film for some, especially those who are still around to remember it, and it's also a very difficult film to watch. But, I managed to get through it all, and I loved every minute of it.\r\n\r\nFor starters, the black-and-white cinematography is outstanding. Although the majority of the film was filmed in Hollywood sets, the cinematographer really makes you believe that the opening scenes were in Oklahoma. The lighting in the nighttime shots are stunning and should have at least earned an Oscar nomination. I don't know how the cinematography here was snubbed.\r\n\r\nBut what really serves as the inspiration to the film's success are the acting performances. The lead actor, Henry Fonda, is fantastic as Tom Joad, and should have won the Oscar here (he lost to best friend Jimmy Stewart for his role in The Philadelphia Story). Fonda delivers in a lot of emotional scenes, such as his reaction to the Dust Bowl and a scene involving the burning of a worker camp. The other strong performance here is Jane Darwell as Ma Joad. Like Fonda, she delivers in a lot of dramatic scenes, such as the scene where she says goodbye to the farm and her final speech at the end. She ended up winning the Oscar, and while I thought she was great, the Supporting Actress Oscar should have gone to Judith Anderson for her role as the creepy maid in Rebecca. I was also impressed with John Carradine as Casey the former preacher. For a preacher who \"lost his spirit\", Carradine's take on the character is very memorable and I was impressed with the intensity in his performance.\r\n\r\nPOSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD:\r\nThe ending has caused problems for many people, especially fans of the book. The book ending involved the pregnant woman's baby to die and something about her feeding an old man. (I might be rusty, cause I've never read the book). The film ended with Fonda's departure and the family's hope for survival. My belief in films based on books is that the film needs to keep the spirit of the book without trying to copy the book. For The Grapes of Wrath, I found nothing wrong with the film ending. For 1940, Hollywood was cautious of depressing its audience (especially in the wake of WWII), and I believe the ending was changed to inspire the audience for hope of better times. That's a good message that can apply in today's times. \r\nEND OF SPOILERS\r\n\r\nIt may be controversial in the changed ending and in the world of politics, but The Grapes of Wrath is a powerful, stunning, and inspiring film. Had it not been for the political controversies, the film might have won Best Picture. But at least the year's winner, Hitchcock's Rebecca, was a film that was worthy of the award.",

So much of Steinbeck's beautiful novel is left out of the film, and it's hard to see his story and characters wedged into the \"gee whizz\" style of film-making so prevalent at the time. But once you get beyond a comparison of the movie to the book, you begin to realize that John Ford created a beautiful piece of work of his own, and the film inspires a great deal of admiration, and deserves credit for its gutsiness at tackling a story that wouldn't have gone down smoothly with film executives at the time.\n\nOf course the most controversial parts of the book are left out (like its final image, for example), but Ford still managed to work around the constraints forced upon him to fashion a hard-biting film. Henry Fonda is perfect casting for Tom Joad--never have his otherworldly eyes been used to greater effect. And Jane Darwell is pitch-perfect as Ma Joad--she captures the tough-as-nails dignity that the character has in the novel. The whole movie is lit by expert cinematographer Gregg Toland, who uses shadow and reflection to cast a ghostly pall over everything. Indeed, much of what Ford wasn't able to include in the film as words he communicates instead through images, and isn't that what a good book-to-film adaptation should do? One of those films that feels ahead of its time.",

John Ford's film is a hauntingly vivid vision of poverty and hopelessness but the unity of a family to find strength in difficult situations. At a time when Hollywood often dished always fewer films with a social weight and importance as this one, The Grapes of Wrath really stands out as a genuine and rare portrayal of difficult situations the kind that neo realists did in Italy.

You come out of it feeling the strength of the Joads as well as the inhumanity they face traveling from the Dust Bowl in Oklahoma to California.

            "content": "I've heard of the fruits of labor, but I don't exactly know what to make of the \"grapes of wrath\", because I know good and well that wrath isn't exactly a good thing, and always figured that the term \"fruit\" was associated with something good, so I reckon I need to go back and do a bit more research on the term \"fruit\", unless of course grapes aren't actually considered fruits, in which case, I better not do any research or else my head will explode in a juicy mess like a grape, because the classification of a tomato is confusing enough. Maybe it's not so much the grapes that are wrathful as much as it's the grapevine, because if root is associated with all evil, then vines have to at least be pretty wrathful. Symbolic and ironically fitting planting term jokes aside, whenever I look at that title, I can't help but imagine a giant bunch of grapes descending from the sky and destroying everything so that the humans would finally know what it's like to be juiced, though I knew that this film would never be about that, because Steinbeck probably wouldn't do something that stupid. Lennie Small would look at that book and say, \"I may be retarded, but don't insult my intelligence\", but hey, it wouldn't be too much cheesier than this film's trailer, whose first minute was spent going on and on about the success of the book and even went as far as to put together corny dramatisations involving people talking about how they've \"never had such a demand for a book\" and \"can't supply the demand\". Of course, when you get down to it, the film is hardly cheesy, or at least about as hardly cheesy as it could get in 1940, which is probably why this film won John Ford his, like, sixteenth Oscar and hardly anything else. Well, to be fair, John Ford could have directed the biggest piece of garbage ever, and he would have still won Best Director, as sure as the hypothetical film in question would be lauded as a masterpiece fifty years later. Shoot, Ford's been dead since '73, and I'm surprised he's still not winning Oscars, as the Oscars did love him just so much, and I'm fine with that, because the man sure know how to make some good films, such as this one, and yet, as rewarding as this film is, not everything in this effort proves fruitful... if fruitful is actually supposed to mean rewarding.\r\n\r\nQuite a bit has aged reasonably gracefully with this, for its time, in quite a few ways, fairly unique film, yet there's no getting around that, at the same time, quite a bit has dated, and often pretty cheesily, with dialogue being particularly faulty, whether when it's turning in a couple of shoddy one-off lines or serving as a component to the film's awkward exposition. The film opens up with Henry Fonda's Tom Joad character catching a ride after getting out of jail and predicting the thoughts and curiosity of the driver, just so explanations on where Joad was coming from and why he was sent there could be crowbarred in, and while expository dialogue pieces of that nature in the subsequent body are rarely on that level of awkward unsubtlety, screenwriter Nunnally Johnson puts only so much subtle delicacy into crafting plot and characters, with the character aspects being particularly flawed, partially because of some of the performances behind the characters. Now, some performances are better than others, with John Qualen stealing the show for the startlingly limited amount of time that he's occupies, delivering a strong presence, complimented by a surprising amount of potent emotional range, both strikingly broad and hauntingly subtle, that defines the human depth of the victims of this terrible time and helps in making the early acts effective as a hook. Of course, that's just the hook that Qualen all but carries, and outside of that, while you can expect quite a few other passable, if not reasonably decent performances, particularly that of the Oscar-earning Jane Darwell, also expect to see a couple of performances that fall flat as hardly effective, occasionally embarassingly, with Henry Fonda proving ineffective as a key lead by donning a presence near-devoid of layer variety, and making it all the worse through sometimes wooden, sometimes overdone and altogether nearly consistently weak line delivery. There are more strengths to the characterization than missteps, thus compensations for some faulty performances can be found, and backed up by perhaps as many fair performances as improvable ones, yet the fact of the matter is that the handling and portrayal of many of the characters who help drive this plot isn't without its shortcomings, much like other areas in plotting, for although the story is strong enough and, in quite a few areas, well-structured enough to make the final product compelling, there gets to be too much filler and not enough material to fully sustain your emotional investment, which leaves the potency of the dramatic depth to go a bit distanced at times. Again, the film is a compelling one today as sure as it was during its time, yet much has not aged as gracefully as it probably should have, with certain aspects being improvable on a general level, thus making for a flawed drama, yet one that rewards nevertheless. The film has its fair share of shortcomings, yet accels more often than not, particularly when it comes to visual style.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, the visual style of this 1940 black-and-white film has dated all but considerably, yet for its time, Gregg Toland's cinematography was stunning, and remains commendable to this day, boasting near-striking detail and near-exceedingly clever lighting play that accentuates both darkness and light in a fashion that proves to be both quite handsome and supplementary to the film's tonal and, to a certain degree, thematic depths. If you can claim appreciation for the relative uniqueness of the Toland's photographic efforts, then you'll find yourself hard pressed to not be consistently engaged by the visual artistry that both catches your eye and stands as one of your more subtle touches to the film's depth, which isn't to say that the script is completely devoid of much of the graceful subtlety that this subject matter deserves. Again, some of the film's biggest flaws usually rest within Nunnally Johnson's screenplay, which gets to be all too often rather awkward and, in some areas, problematically-structured, yet perhaps on the whole, Johnson's take on John Steinbeck's classic vision, whether it be faithful or loose, stands reasonably strong, boasting only so much color in exposition and depth, yet color, nevertheless, that fleshes out and breathes enough life into the story to keep it lively and engaging, or at least more so, as the basic story concept, alone, holds quite a bit of livliness and engagement value. Yes, people, while I have, of course, not read Steinbeck's classic Pulitzer Prize winner that was apparently too successful for them to, at least according this film's aforementioned lame trailer, \"supply the demand\", yet am still quite aware that, after a while, this film strays quite a ways away from the original source material, yet whether it was the vision of Steinbeck or the revision of Johnson, what I'm seeing here is a very potent story concept with strong ideas, complimented by much dynamicity and weight of both a tonal and thematic nature, and while the execution of the worthy story concept doesn't always do the subject matter total justice, Johnson does a generally decent job of handling the tale, while director John Ford does an even better job. Now, with that said, it's not like John Ford's directorial efforts prove thoroughly effective, as he could work better with Johnson's script and Steinbeck's story, as sure as he could work better with more than a few performers, yet on the whole, Ford's efforts feel nothing short of inspired enough to keep atmosphere alive in order to produce a consistent degree of vitality that creates entertainment value, as well as an occasional degree of dramatic punch to really spark engagement value. The film's emotional resonance isn't exactly thorough, nor does it always age all that gracefully, yet it's there, and when it arrives, it often truly engrosses with graceful humanity that won't exactly leave you to cry your eyes out, but will certainly move you as it defines much depth within this should-be more well-handled tale. Make no mistake, this film could have indeed been better, yet as it stands, what is done right has enough charge to it to grip consistently and leave you to walk away rewarded.\r\n\r\nTo wrap up, the film finds its share of cheesily dated areas, whether it be dialogue or certain spots in exposition and characterization, whose effectiveness go further softended by more than a few improvable performances to match the passable, or even commendable performances, and with moments of problematic plotting proving to be distancing, the final product comes out falling short of its potential, yet not to an underwhelming state, going supported by striking cinematography and a worthy story concept, brought to life with general success by Nunnally Johnson's colorful script and John Ford's reasonably inspired direction, thus leaving \"The Grapes of Wrath\" to stand as a flawed yet ultimately compelling and rewarding classic dramatic piece.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

John Ford won the Best Director Oscar for this film, showing how a great director doesn't waste a single moment and there's absolutely no extraneous filler to be seen. The use of darkness/black is astounding in the film, great work of cinematography and great camera work on closeups of starving children and the faces of the adults who have to see it.  Ford was the greatest film chronicler of the West and Manifest Destiny, so it's fascinating to see his take on what was in many ways, the last great Westward migration, during the Great Depression.  Above all else, this is the story of the human spirit, it's will to survive, endure, and move forward in the face of crippling adversity.

You just can't help but to feel for the plight of the main characters, and follow them intently as they continuously journey onward searching for hope and prosperity.  In a rather grim fashion, the characters are forced to confront disappointment, and ultimately persecution and hardship at every turn.\n\nThis classic John Steinbeck story is perhaps as relevant now as it was back in the 30s; it serves to criticize the ideals of the American dream, and it proves quite effective as it documents the migration of displaced farmers and workers across the nation.  The story is a journey that pushes the characters to extremes, and provides a fairly hellish view of the dustbowl in general.  It's driven by a constant pattern, in which the characters come close to finding what they're looking for, and then having it snatched away from them.  It's pretty bleak, but the characters remain endearing, especially with their endless conviction and motivation.\n\nOn film, the story is immortalized with excellent photography and editing.  The acting is swell:  Henry Fonda, John Carradine, and heck, just about everybody inhabit their characters quite well.  The writing is superb.  This production is loaded with good, real-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales.  The music used is fitting.\n\nRecommended!\n\n4.5/5 (Entertainment:  Good | Story:  Perfect | Film:  Very Good)",

            "content": "As one of the most critically acclaimed pieces of literature in American history, it was nearly inevitable that John Steinbeck\u00e2??s 1939 novel The Grapes of Wrath would eventually be made into a film. John Ford soon pounced on this opportunity making The Grapes of Wrath a film only a year after the novels original release. While John Fords recreation of The Grapes of Wrath stayed accurate to the book on which it was based in terms of general ideas and events, he chose to leave out significant events that led to important messages the Pulitzer prize winning story was meant to provide its audience with. Ford also chose to take a much different path in terms of what the Joad family meant to the story. Steinbeck used the Joads as an example of a typical family traveling west during the dustbowl, while Ford focused less on the family\u00e2??s journey, and more on the relationship between Tom Joad and his mother. While the Film provides its audience with a significant history lesson similar to that of Steinbeck\u00e2??s version, the novel remains superior, as it provides a meaningful life lesson to its readers.\n\tJohn Steinbeck\u00e2??s The Grapes of Wrath utilizes the character Rose of Sharon to educate the reader on many different aspects of being a pregnant woman during the dust bowl. Steinbeck zero\u00e2??s in on her emotions, her relationship with both her family and husband Connie, and her realization that she truly has a purpose on earth. Her purpose, as ma told her, was that when the baby was born she would be responsible for a human life, and the way that child turned out would be based on her parenting. When her pregnancy unfortunately results in a miscarriage, she realizes her purpose wasn\u00e2??t necessarily to assist the life of that child, but those in need. This realization occurs when she meets an emaciated man in a barn that she proceeds to help survive. This lesson by Steinbeck shows the reader that every person has a purpose, and that it will eventually be discovered. While Rose of Sharon was very important in the book, she played a minimal role in the movie. Ford does not give Rose of Sharon many lines at all, and her emotions throughout the story are barely even touched upon. Ford includes the relationship between Rose of Sharon and Connie in order to keep accuracy to the book, but the significance of the relationship seems completely unnoticed by Ford. Because Fords adaptation of The Grapes of Wrath ignores Rose of Sharon as a character, it fails to utilize the significance of her pregnancy, and the important message that went along with it in the novel. Although the end of the book is not included in the novel, it cannot be fully blamed on John Ford. These final scenes were not included in the film due to the controversy with the public the scenes were presumed to have caused (IMDB).\n\tThe journey from Oklahoma was a long treacherous one for a 1930\u00e2??s American family commuting in an over occupied jalopy, or at least it was portrayed that way in Steinbeck\u00e2??s version of the story. Steinbeck focuses a majority of his novel on the Joads trip to California, in order to stay true to reality. Ford chooses to make the journey of the Joads less important than the family\u00e2??s experience once they arrive in the Promised Land. The main focus in each version of The Grapes of Wrath differ greatly: Steinbeck used the family as more of a way to display the journey and dynamic of an average family of the time period, and possible troubles they may encounter, whereas Ford focuses mostly on the Joad family\u00e2??s experiences upon arriving in California. This comparison can be supported by the fact that John Ford\u00e2??s production left out most of the inner chapters consisting of an abundance of metaphors that Steinbeck used to craft the various messages of his novel.\n\t It is safe to say that a book totaling over 450 pages has much more room for analysis than that in a 2-hour movie. This disability for film certainly shows in this situation. Not only did the film not include the metaphorical chapters and ending that the novel did, they also developed the characters much less. This definitely shows in the underdevelopment of Rose of Sharon and Connie. Given the time constraint, Ford does an excellent job developing the character of Ma. He inserts her as the heart and soul of the family, which would be more meaningful if the start of the novel were included where Steinbeck explains that all families looked at the bravery of the men to gauge their attitudes. Although the Novel proves superior to the film in many significant categories, the movie by no means fails. John Ford took on a tremendous challenge in creating The Grapes of Wrath. Ford certainly succeeded in making the dialogue and scenery accurate to what one would have assumed from reading the book. Whether one becomes acquainted with the Grapes of Wrath visually or by text, the experience will certainly not be a disappointment.",

            "content": "Film Review: The Grapes of Wrath\nNearly every book is better than the movie. The Grapes of Wrath based off John Steinbeck\u00e2(TM)s\u00e2(TM) masterpiece is no exception. The Grapes of Wrath was made into film in 1940, yet today we can still say it is easily one of the most significant films ever produced in American history. Its significance is not only that of film making accomplishments at the time, but the historical context of the story. The film follows the Joad family on their California bound trip towards a better life. In the process they meet a number of characters, encounters and dangers. The real accomplishment of the film though is the cinematographic advance made at the time. Today, we don\u00e2(TM)t regard the Grapes of Wrath\u00e2(TM)s cinematography as the best of today, leaving the viewer with a huge gap between intended effect and actual effect. Perhaps that is the greatest fault of the film. \nThe main reason for the gap between director and audience in the film is the fact that the movie is, quite simply, so old. Today\u00e2(TM)s audience thrives on films such as Avatar, nearly 60% computer generated, The Hangover and Pirates of the Caribbean, all of which had great technical experts and stunt doubles on board. Today, we have become accustomed to technology and ability. It is a vital part of our life and a crucial part of movie making. It is because we are used to high tech movies. We are accustomed to seeing innovative angles used to capture the scene as it unfolds. Hardly are viewers today used to black and white pictures on the scene or grains in the images. As a film for an audience today to watch and enjoy, the cinematography is simply too different. \nOverall, the process of movie making has not changed a great deal, but technological advances have made colors brighter, transitions easier, editing smother, etc. An audience viewing a film that was made over 70 years ago in black and white won\u00e2(TM)t receive the films same message if the film were to be recreated with the same script today. The somewhat choppy transitions between scenes or the panning from face to face seems immature by today\u00e2(TM)s standards. It\u00e2(TM)s not that the film was poorly made. At the time, it was a demonstration of how far technology had come and a great asset to the movie making industry. \nEven more so, the film itself does contain many of the same lines, scenes and nearly all of the same characters as the masterfully crafted book but it lacks the final scene: a scene which, in all essence, makes the book. To exempt the final scene in the barn from the movie would have tacked on another ten minutes to make the story work. But the feature already runs 128 minutes, whats ten or even twenty more? \nQuite simply, the film was a great leap for its time and we will continue to remember it as an iconic asset to the history of movie making, nothing more. It doesn\u00e2(TM)t make sense to remember it for any other reason other than that it is of legendary importance. Other movies have been made that surpass the technical qualities and acting abilities in the Grapes of Wrath. The Grapes of Wrath deserved its Grammy nominations. But even with its high honors and achievements, it is simply not the type of film one would walk away from today and say, \u00e2I wanna see that again\u00e2?. It is the type of film one must see in their lifetime because it is a legend. Even being a legend, the book is always better than the movie.",

I enjoyed the movie especially since it follows an Oklahoma family that comes to California looking for a better life and to just make any kind of money. Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad a man whos come back home after four years in prison. He goes with his family to California, but unfortunately for Tom he can't escape his past no matter how much he tries to be good. The movie has a nice bonding family that really pulls at your heart. Jane Darwell has some very touching scenes and its apparent why she won the Oscar that year for best supporting actress. The movie is quite sad because no matter what the Joads do they just cant catch a break especially Tom in particular. This is a classic film and definitely go out and check this one!",

This is a highly critically acclaimed movie and is famous for its strong acting performances by Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell, though it moves pretty slow and if I had to pick a grape movie, I would have rather watched \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape?\"  A few of the more memorable scenes are John Qualen's flashback about everybody being forced off of their land, the elderly grandfather (Charley Grapewin)'s refusal to leave his home, and just about any dialogue delivered by Ma Joad (Darwell).  I don't know that I would rank her performance as Oscar-worthy, but she is the first thing to come to my mind when I think about this film.  Even though the film is lauded for its acting, my enjoyment stems from John Steinbeck's story.  The screenplay writers sacrificed a lot of tragedy by changing some of the ending events but the film still captures the helpless situation of Great Depression victims.  The loss of humanity in this situation stuck out to me, as families are desperately searching for work to support their families and business men take advantage of their desperation.  It may not be my favorite, but I'm not surprised that \"The Grapes of Wrath\" appears on a lot critics must-see lists and find it to be a historically relevant film that should be experienced.",

If I was to pray, I'd pray for folks that's alive and don't know which way to turn.\u00a0\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath is very much the classic I was expecting. It is probably the best example of the human struggle to better one's life. The story is one of the most known, as most read it before their out of high school. It's setting is the depression era dust bowl. There's a lot of bad going on and not a whole lot of good. Everyone struggles to find work so that they can feed their families. But work isn't easy to come by. Watching The Grapes of Wrath now, during this economic climate is rather sobering.\n\nThe story follows one family, the Joad family. Tom has just been released from prison and makes it home just in time; right before his family was to set off from their land. They have lived in Oklahoma all their life, but the land is turning a profit or any crops and the government is taking it away from them. So the Joad's decide to do what everyone else is doing, and head for California in hope of finding the land they were promised. Handbills don't always tell the exact truth though. California is just as much a struggle as Oklahoma.\n\nThis is only the second John Ford film I have seen, but I'm already seeing why he is so highly regarded. He captures the hardship of the depression like no film I've seen. He does it extremely well, but also never overplays it. He let's the Joad family speak for themselves. Their hungry, their tired, and their poor.\u00a0\n\nSomething else Ford does really well is showing the different ends of the spectrum, when it comes to people helping people. Their are always people that will help and their are always people that will exploit. In one scene the Joad's go into a diner and the workers there give them food at a discounted cost because they see how hard they got it. Then when they actually get work, all the employers are just exploiting how poor the workers are.\u00a0\n\nGrapes of Wrath is often regarded as one of the best American films ever. It's a movie that everyone knows about and it's influence is just about everywhere. It's one of those movies that everyone almost has to see before they die; a true classic in every sense of the word.",

            "content": "John Ford directed a film based off a novel that everyone loved. It was written in 1939 and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1940. This is just 10 years after the stock market crash and everyone was still feeling the effects. A year after the book was published, The Grapes of Wrath came to the big screen. John Ford gave the people something to connect to. They were seeing stories that they knew all too well. But it showed them they weren't alone. There is such great heart behind the film that it hard not to feel something from it. I think the first scene that really hit me was when Ma put the earrings over her ears and looked at herself in the mirror. Here's a woman who has been evicted from her home and is leaving the state the next day. She misses being the pretty young woman she once was. Where did the time go? What about this future that you dream about having when you're young? All of this within a single shot. And the film is filled with these moments. Tom Joad wants to change himself around and help his family move to California and give them a better life. But he can't stand someone treating someone else poorly. We assume this is why he fought and killed a man, which landed him a 7 year sentence in prison. Henry Fonda plays this rough character in an interesting way. We don't think he's dangerous, but when he is put in a situation we know what he will do. The way he looks at the police passing him, or when they get to the camp to pick peaches he won't take their lies. It was an interesting choice that when they bring Grandpa on the truck to leave Uncle Joe's house he is as stiff as a board, like a dead body. I thought that was perfect. And the night they get stopped and Grandma is dead in the truck with her eyes open gave me an eery feeling. I just had a feeling she was dead without having been told much. John Ford really didn't have to say too much with the film. He lets you feel what is going on. Just show the tragedy of everyone and that's all you need. These are the working class and they will be around forever. We see them today, and this story will, sadly, always have a relevance to society.",

He's meant to be an Okie who's just been paroled after four hard years, not a Wall St broker pondering the winelist.\n\n-  Interesting choice of actor for the part of Ma. I have never seen someone so fat supposedly starving to death! Fading away to a mountain indeed!\n\n- And just to cap it off you've got Grandpa carrying on like a two-bob watch. An overlaid Roger Rabbit-style cartoon character would've been much more convincing. But I suppose it goes with the overracting of the time, leading up to the \"Golden Years\" of Hollywood.\n\nI often wonder, did the actors of this era ever think to themselves \"What on earth am I doing?

Sweeping cinematography, powerful set pieces (I'll never shake the image of those children scrambling for tin cans), memorable characters, and poetic monologues make for an engaging experience.  Nevertheless, I can't help but feel somewhat conflicted by the overt changes made to the plot of the movie and its vaguely optimistic ending in which the protagonist leaves his family behind in search of contributing to some unnamed, elusive social justice.  For such a dreary and depressing film, the ending seemed rather tacked on when actually the fates of our characters are left wide open for debate.  We have no reason to suspect that they will endure past their next temporary stint of picking (wherever that may be) and this leaves room for some truly provocative and unsettling afterthoughts, but it isn't much of a resolution except for the most naive of moviegoers.

That's largely because you're drawn in to the personal struggles of a family of tenant farmers during the midwest droughts of the 1930s and their subsequent migration westwards to California. The poverty and prejudice they faced is no different to what millions face today but that it occured in America less than a century ago is particularly shocking and poignant.",

During the great depression, a suffering family is forced to move out of their homes as they are torn down one-by-one. Lead by a moving performance by Henry Fonda who is out of prison on early parole, the \"Joads\" are on route to California, where they believe they can find work and restart their lives. Along the way, they mourn loses of loved ones and cherish whatever they have to survive. They make stops in campgrounds and pitch tents so that they may have a place to keep warm enough through the night. As the worst possible occurences come their way, Tom (Fonda) finds himself killing a man, which then leads to him having to make decisions of where to move next. This is one of the most moving pictures of all time. The cinematography makes you feel that you are in every situation and the dialogue will make you cringe. It is wonderfully written and the direction by John Ford is heart-stopping. There is never a dull moment in this film. I would be underrating this film by calling it a masterful breakthrough in cinema, because the only word to describe this work of art, is \"Spine-tinglingly, awe-inspiringly, magnificent!\"",

John Ford captures the majority of Steinbeck's message, although leaving out the most crucial meaning that Steinbeck hoped to render. \r\n\tThis film captured its audience and made them part of the Joad family. Using advanced camera placements, such as the hood of the Joad's Jalopy, the viewer has a first person view on history. Although fiction, Ford brings forth the true trials from the times and positions them for a revolutionary experience. \r\n\tWith option for color, Ford succumbed to his natural liking for black and white. This allowed a poor feel for the movie, again bringing forth the emotions that families must have felt.\r\n\tThis is a great movie, but Steinbeck's message of community was lost. The film focuses on only the Joads, but the novel focused on twenty families becoming one. This sense of community is vital in creating a successful novel, but with consolidation for a film, Ford let go of community. Not only was community an important point in Steinbeck's overall message, but more predominately capitalism. The film conveys not relativity to capitalism, yet the novel does. \r\n\tFor a fun and entertaining experience, the Grapes of Wrath is a great movie. After boarding the rollercoaster film, one will walk away with appreciation for what they have and will have deeper knowledge of history. \r\n\tAlthough a moving film, the novel definitely should be read. Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath includes much more detail and a stronger ending that capitalizes on his point of capitalism. \r\n\tBoth the film and the novel are very well done, but the movie is only half of the book's success.",

            "content": "If one was to watch The Grapes of Wrath without reading the book it would be considered a great movie. Throughout the entire movie John Ford accurately captures the feelings and emotions generated by this time in American history. Utilizing black and white film rather than color gives the movie a somewhat desolate appearance which mirrors the dust and sand of the setting and the general distress of the farmers. The farmers, who have been left out to dry by big corporations, are on their way to California where they have heard that there are plenty of jobs for all because the large land owners have taken their land. \r\nThe camera work was well done by capturing the Joad family and the tribulations that they go through.  The acting was well done by Henry Fonda as Tom Joad and Jane Darwell as Ma Joad for example. \r\n However, the movie changes Steinbeck's message and because of this can only be considered mediocre at best. In the book, Steinbeck preaches that in society community is the most important aspect rather than the individual. While in the movie the focus strays from the importance of the community and sticking together and centers more on the family where the overall meaning seems to be the Joad family and that the family will get together rather than teaming up with other people in the same situation. For example, in the book there it starts to rain and the families in the sourounding camp must help each other shovel dirt into banks to keep the camp from flooding and this reiterates Steinbecks point of community. But this and other scenes are left absent from the movie including the ending where Rose of Sharan breast feeds starving man to save him from death. These missing scenes from the movie readjust's the true meaning of Steinbeck's story so if you want just a good movie rather than book-to-movie accuracy I'd go for it.",

            "content": "This is one of the few films on Rotten Tomatoes with a 100% rating.  The reason why is because, well, it\u00b4s a classic, in almost every sense.  It was one of the first 25 films to be selected for preservation in the US National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.  The book it's based on is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by John Steinbeck.  \r\n\r\nSo what kind of film is this?  Well, it's movie based on a historical event; depicting both the Dust Bowl and many elements of the Great Depression.  For two, the film itself is historically significant given the time period and context it was made (in 1940).  For three, it is a powerful film about a family living in what seems the most dire of times and succeeding regardless, through thick and thin.  All three of these are important things to consider when viewing this film.\r\n\r\nOne thing to keep in mind is that at the time it was produced, faith in capitalism had been extremely shaken.  The Great Depression seemed a failure throughout the majority of the western world, with the country being least hit by the Great Depression being the one that lay outside of the international markets in that area -- the USSR, namely.  The USSR had such a unique economic system that lay outside of almost every other economic system currently in use, it was not affected when world trade was.\r\n\r\nThis is important to note, as the Grapes of Wrath is undoubtedly sympathetic towards Communism -- although the book goes more heavily into this than the film does, from what I've heard (I haven't read it myself yet, alas, and will edit this review if I am proven wrong).  In the present day perspective, only one country with communism really \"succeeded\", and that's China; and even then, China is growing more and more capitalist economically, while still remaining an autocratic government.  Thus, modern day perspective and the perspective this film was made in are decidedly different.\r\n\r\nThe events seen in the film that are touched on are also historically interesting; I watched this film as part of my American History from WWI to WWII course, and it was an intense time period, especially in the dust bowl.  The scene in the plains of the US was an amazing story in and of itself, from when the Comanche were driven from the area, from when XIT Ranch bought a major chunk of land, from when XIT tried to raise cows and failed miserably, and then sold the land as real estate for people to farm a living on land that, while good for grass, was crap for wheat and vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe film doesn't quite focus on this, however, more catching the tail end with the dusters.  Grapes of Wrath instead focuses on another idea; small groups of wealthy men and business owners driving out many tenant farmers with industrial machinery (namely, the caterpillar tractor), and big business becoming the major problem of the Depression.  This theme is explored again and again throughout the film, where in every place the Joads family traveled to, the common man was the one that tried to look out for one another; there's a very significant scene in a diner that I felt particularly emotional:  The owner gives the Joads a $.15 loaf of bread for $.10, and two $.05 candies to the children for $0.01 for both, out of compassion... and then the wise-cracking truck drivers paid with what seemed like a full silver dollar, leaving without taking their change.  However, big bosses did not show this level of generosity, explicitly exploiting workers whenever they could; in the case of a boss offering a job for peach-picking $0.50, and then halving it when he can.  Workers strike, and he finds other workers to pay the $0.5 for, intending to repeat the process over again.\r\n\r\nWherever the family goes, people seem to grow more and more selfish, with the only truly selfless people being the few workers that had had enough and were trying to fight back in any way they could.  Than the Joads finally reach a place that almost seemed like out of a Normal Rockwell painting; a community that had dances, laughter, showers, and generally where one could feel civilized again.  This small community is the closest one can find to a commune; the police are not allowed inside without a warrant (on exception of a strike), and those in charge of the community are voted by the five different sectors that comprise it.  While there's a conspiracy between police and bosses to try to destroy the community, they are quickly outwitted subtly, through good observation and looking out for one another's back.\r\n\r\nAll of this shows a very important theme of the worker vs. the industrial baron, with definitely a sympathetic eye to the ideals of communism.  But that's enough about the history and context; onto the film itself.\r\n\r\nThe film itself is good.  It's well-paced, it's interesting, it has cast members that fill their role incredibly well, and perhaps something I found most interesting, it had a strong female character not defined by sexuality -- Ma Joad, played by Jane Darwell.  She makes an interesting character throughout this film, being the foundation the rest of the family can rest upon.  She's quick-witted and able to do what needs to be done as the family goes on, never giving in to the hardships that surround her.\r\n\r\nI could probably go on some more, but I should probably save it for the actual essay I'm to write on this film.  I'll just finish by saying this:  If you have any interest in this period of time or on the Great Depression in general, or if you want to see a great classic and don't mind a black and white film, this should be your choice.",

The film begins with our tale's hero, Tom Joad (Henry Fonda), just being released from jail, and heading home to find his family. Once he gets there he only finds an old beat up house, and he is informed that his family is fixing to leave for California. They all have a happy reunion right before Tom and the rest of the family depart for California; However, once the Joad family reaches California they realize that it may not be near as pleasant as they had imagined, and now they must try and make a living off of very little work. And with things looking bad for the Joad family, having almost no food on the dinner table every night, they will have to do everything they can to just remain alive in these dark times.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Grapes of Wrath is one of the greatest, if not greatest, american films ever made. And it is one of my personal favorite films of all time. I have put off reviewing for awhile for whatever reasons, and now I am going to finally write it. The story to this film was for the most part amazing. For those of us that live in today's time, the great depression is only something that we learn about in history books, so for some this film may not be quite as pwerful as it is for others. But for anyone that actually lived in the depression, or has known people that have, it is is easier to understand the importance of this film, and the book by John Steinbeck. It is really sad, but true, that life was once this way, and this is both an educational and meaningful film about how life used to be in America. The Grapes of Wrath, both film and book, truly capture the real horrors of the great depression, and that is one of the reasons I love this film so much. It is as important of a film to this country as To Kill a Mockingbird is, and in my opinion that is saying something. The Grapes of Wrath is hands down for me one of the best film adaptions of a book. I know a lot of these types of fims get critcism for not being like the book, but I feel that even people who enjoyed the book, will also enjoy this film.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeeing as The Grapes of Wrath was directing by the great John Ford, I do not think the film's success will come as a surprise to many people. John Ford was one of the finest directors to ever walk this earth, though I don't think you will see him at the top of many people's favorite list, no one can deny some of the great film making he did over his career. He was a brilliant man who had an absolutely brilliant career. And when he filmed The Grapes of Wrath he did one of the most difficult things a director can do, and that is take a book and make a movie out of it. Not only that, but he made it just as good, or better than the book, and that takes talent. John Ford's direction in this film is absolute perfection. He takes what could be a very boring story, about a large counrty family moving to California, and he turns it into what is what I believe to be one of the greatest stories ever told. Filled with some of the best characters in film history. Especially Tom Joad and Ma Joad.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe acting was superb. Henry Fonda gives what may be his career performance in this film. He plays the main character in the film, Tom Joad, and he does it perfectly. He may not have won best actor for the performance, but he was still nothing short of excellent. Henry Fonda is one of my all time favorite actors, and he deservedly was given the Honorary Award. Though not to take anything away from his performance, as brilliant as it was Henry Fonda's acting was not my favorite in this film. Jane Darwell stole the show here. She did not have all too great of a career, but I do not think there is another actress in this world that could have played the part of Ma Joad better then Jane Darwell did in this film. It would have been wrong to give anyone else the Oscar. Words cannot describe how meaningful, and incredible her performance was in this film. And really all around everyone did a good job acting in this film.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, The Grapes of Wrath is a true masterpiece. Not many films have been made that I can say I felt were better than this one. This is the true meaning of film making right here. Absolutely perfect acting, it does not get much better than this, and the cast was great as well. I enjoyed everyone's performances in this film, and I can't say that for too many movies, especially nowadays. The direction by John Ford is not to be missed, and as magnificant of a career as he had, The Grapes of Wrath is probably the greatest film he ever released. And even for an old classic the music was actually enjoyable in this film. Movies just do not get much better than this, if you are a movie fan at all, The Grapes of Wrath is for you.",

It's best that the film was made in the more humble days of Hollywood, when actors like Henry Fonda played the characters in the novel, not Hollywood's interpretation of the characters.  Can you imagine if it was made today?  I can just see Sean Penn attempt to play a character of Tom's depth and fail epically.  But I'm sure someone in Hollywood is thinking of remaking this great film, because they can't think of anything original.",

Now picture being forced away from your home and land-everything you own- along with thousands of others to find work elsewhere to make a living. The tragedy of such a scene is displayed in this wonderful adaptation of John Steinbeck's The Grapes Of Wrath. This classic film follows a family who is forced out of Oklahoma to California to find work as they move from place to place and find nothing but struggles and trouble. It may seem like very little to what the film is about, but the film is very interesting, and I feel it has especially held up well today. At the time, this film well represented the reality of such unfortunate results from the economic depression, while viewing it today it's quite fascinating how well the economy has prospered since, it's like we're looking directly at life as it was 70 years ago. I can't compare it to the novel since I haven't read it, but I can't imagine this film being any better or more faithful to its theme. The cast all play their parts wonderfully, and the film is very well produced for its time. This is an extraordinary classic not only as a film, but also as a highly well written story by John Steinbeck who I know was a great writer in his time (I highly adored his novel Of Mice And Men).",

Look out for Jane Darwell as Ma Joad, who picked up the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress (which she undoubtedly deserved with her portrait as a woman brought to the edge by her tribulations).",

Thought maaaaybe there'd be an hour and a half when I could watch The General online. Nope. Then I really wanted to take my baby cousin, Carys, to see ...Dragon but timing didnt work out. Although that turned out for the best cause Im gonna get to see it at the IMAX this weekend. Anyhoo, as much as I wanted to just put on something mindless and pass out tonight, I figured that I really gotta get these AFI movies done. I keep missing one arbitrary deadline after another another, and I'm so \\m/ close.\r\n\r\nBefore I get into tonight's movie, I forgot to post this article. It amused me (mostly because it prominently features the word expletive, including the phrase expletive deleted) even if I dont agree with the writer's stance on the subject.\r\n\r\nRight. AFI movie. Tonight's pick was The Grapes of Wrath. I dont know if its cause I didnt do a good job balancing out the movies so Im left with a decent selection, or if Im getting exhausted on the last legs of the project, or if its life in general, but Im finding it more and more difficult to get into these films. Although this time around, I swear I really was trying. And it had me sometimes. But the problem was that its really depressing (and slow) and with everything I've had to deal with lately (still not going into detail), depressing isnt exactly what Im in the mood for.\r\n\r\nI did like the characters. Ma Joad in particular stood out to me, as did the preacher, err former preacher. Also particularly liked that diner scene early on where they're trying to buy food for the trip. Found the way it played out and ultimately concluded very touching. I can see how the film is considered significant in the movie world, but just not quite something I woulda wanted to watch right now if I didnt have a mission to accomplish.\r\n\r\nhttp://expletivedleted.livejournal.com\r\nhttp://www.twitter.com/expletivedleted",

            "content": "The Grapes of Wrath, based on the Pultzer Prize winning novel by John Steinbeck, boasts a powerful performance from Henry Fonda and stylish directing from John Ford, but is very flawed. The films starts with Tom Joad (Fonda), who is released from jail after several years, and arrives at his family's farm to find nobody there. Along with an ex preacher named Jim Casey, Joad finds his family at is uncle's house, preparing to go to California in search of jobs, because the banks had evicted all of the farmers in the Oklahoma from their houses. And so begins one of the greatest American tales of ambition, rebellion, and tragedy. The story is expertly told by John Ford through interesting camera angles and riveting performances, but the script was childlike; because it was incredibly simple, talked down to the audience, and lacked the adequate amount of emotional depth that was needed to carry along the story. Although the theme is timeless, a few scenes are very contemporary and don't sit as well with the rest of the film as they might have in the 1940s. Within these scenes, there are many minor characters that give terrible performances and say useless lines. Despite this, Henry Fonda defines himself flawlessly as the common man: Tom Joad, one of the most iconic figures in film today. Jane Darwell and John Carradine also give tremendous performances. Though it is undoubtedly a true American classic, The Grapes of Wrath falls short of its potential and is scarred by poor writing. 88/100",

But John Ford makes a reasonable running jump at it in 128 minutes.\n\nThere are some beautiful shots cinematically in this movie.  Long-range shots of individuals against a vast sky frame the movie, and appropriately so, in keeping with a theme of how small man is - whether in contrast with the inexorable pressures of life, at the hands of institutionalized greed, or in terms of character, in perpetrating horrendous cruelty and exploitation against other human beings.   There is also great use of lighting, particulary in regards to the former preacher, Casy (played by John Carradine).  Characters - particularly Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) - move in and out of shadows and darkness throughout the movie, both literally and figuratively.\n\nThere are also some terrible shots that are obviously done on a soundstage (there is actually an echo when the characters speak).  \n\nHenry Fonda gives a great performance, conveying a quiet intensity throughout the film as he seeks to understand the world he has re-entered after four years in prison.  \n\nThe main difficulty is that there is no way that the movie can adequately carry the exposition of the book, much of which is internalized.  Characters that receive a little more treatment in the book are oddly incongruous in the film, coming to the forefront once or twice, ever-present and relatively pointless in the background.  \n\nThe book rails against the exploitation of the poor and disadvantaged 'Okies' - share-croppers in the Midwest, devastated by the massive change in agriculture from small farms to corporate conglomerates, and by the terrible winds that stripped the soil of the midwest and made small-scale farming almost impossible.    One of the interesting things about watching this from Netflix is that the DVD includes two screens of text that preceded the UK-release of the film, and sought to provide a historical context to it for those unfamiliar with the situation in the United States.  \n\nPhilosophically and theologically, the film grapples with the nature of life and changing values in America.  The exploitation of the Okies as they migrate to California is ruthlessly demonstrated, yet still muted compared to the book.  Steinbeck clearly sees the dangerous alliance of industry and government that becomes possible, ensuring the continued suffering and deaths of citizens who have already lost everything, so that they appear to be not even human.  Critical roles are those of Tom Joad, Casy, and Ma Joad.  \n\nTom functions as a sort of Everyman, trying to make sense of things.  He has an idea of how things ought to be or used to be, but is unsure of how to manage the personal and economic transitions and convulsions he is caught in the middle of.  While mankind once fought off wild animals and other people to establish a stake in the world and eke out his daily bread, the poor are faced with a far more menacing foe now.  An enemy that has no body, but is rather a corporate entity.  There's no one enemy to face down or kill - only the relentless, grinding machinations of industry.  You can kill the parts, but the parts are replaceable.  \n\nCasy is an interesting character.  He's a former preacher who baptized Tom as a young boy, but Casy has now \"lost the Spirit\", and can't preach any longer.  He was and is haunted by the demons he has personally battled and often lost to.  But he's seeking truth.  He functions as a seer of sorts in the novel/movie, affirming the truth of what various characters express as they cross the Joad's path.  And he ultimately 'sees the light', so to speak, in California, as he finds himself able to once again champion truth and rightness - a role that, like the Savior he once served, gets him killed.\n\nMa Joad is the family glue.  She holds the family together with her strength and determination.  Where the men become disoriented as their roles in society are destroyed (bread-winner, provider), she steps into the gap their absent leadership creates, focusing on maintaining the family.  But it's more than even her considerable strength can accomplish.  The land formed a \"boundary\" that helped her create stability and enforce the routine and traditions that bind a family together.  But without the land and that objective focus, there's no way to keep the family together.  They fragment, lost in doubt and disappointment, felled by heartache and loss, scattered by their rage against the faceless, disembodied oppressiveness of a brutally capitalistic society. \n\nTom leaves in search of truth, both to find it for himself and to share it with others.  We may work to feed ourselves, but if we don't have a central truth to provide the grounding for our lives, even full stomachs ultimately aren't enough to keep a person going.\n\nThe brutality of  this movie & book is driven home all the more by realizing that this occurred within living memory.  There are people who remember the Depression, who lived through it and bear witness to it.  And it happened here - in America.  Important lessons to keep in mind when we try to fool ourselves into thinking that such abuses 'can't happen here', or that we've evolved beyond such responses.  It could happen here - to you, to me.  And how we respond to such a situation, and what role we take up within it, may be guided in large part by how diligently we have sought truth, and how tenaciously we hold on to it as the defining aspect of our lives, rather than visa versa.",

Tons has been said about the film itself, it's stars, director John Ford and of course based on the gripping novel by John Steinbeck, what I found surprising is the 2007 Fox DVD release's DVD commentary track with John Ford historian: Joesph McBride and Steinbeck Historian: Susan Shillinglaw. How many times have you ever heard respectful disagreement about men's motivations as artists. These 2 really know thier stuff and between them they give a lot of detail on the men and the days they lived in. Ford & Steinbeck both came from everyday man backgrounds and were both adamant Anti-communist liberals who because of thier works highlighting the battles of the common man against a rich ownership society (especialy this film & book) were accussed of being COMMUNISTS of all things. These accusations were made by powerful California Farming/ Banks monetary forces who stood a lot to loose money wise by the exposure of the unsafe farm housing conditions, poverty and indebited servitude that the low wages forced upon thousands of migrant dust bowl American farm workers and thier families. Both men were American Patriots. Ford served in the OSS in WW2 and made frontline combat films for the military and Steinbeck served as a war correpondent in WW2 and later in Vietnam.

Or when the Grandma dies and is asking for Grandpa....didn't Grandpa have a first name?  \n\nAnyways, it did give some insight into a side of the Great Depression you don't see very often.  Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell are good in it.",

Even though these are fictional people they are so broadly written that it feels as though they are real. What I was most amazed by in this movie is that these people try to \"make it\" by being honest. I also liked how they showed how the common man was brow-beaten by the state authorities. The poor were barely given a chance at this time and it's amazing people survived at all. It's not surprising that force was used and necessary to provoke change from the government.",

The slow and extremely painful collapse of the deeply complex, lovable, pitiful yet admirable Joad family was so saddening and strangely so uplifting at the same time, that in my mind the Great Depression, actually the entire country I live in, IS that book. Truly a difficult story to capture on film, I thought. \r\n\r\nBut, several years later, I decided to give the very famous movie version a shot, just to see if it was half as good as the book. To my suprise, the film doesn't compare with the book, but instead adds a whole new element to the vivid image of 1930s America started by John Steinbeck. Somehow, while telling almost the same story, the film finishes the book, and completes the portrait of the deeply complex Joad family. Henry Fonda is otherwordly as Tom Joad, and Jane Darwell holds her own right beside his legendary performance with her own of Ma. What was most enjoyable though, was the short, but extremely memorable appearances of characters like Grandpa, the former preacher, and the (not so) crazy man who explains that a man owns land when he's born and dies on it, not when he owns some piece of paper saying he does. It's these performances that are special and they all come together to make a truly beautiful film. A must see.",

I am a big fan of John Stienbeck and thought the movie portrayed everything that was great about the book (of course some things are going to be lost, but you remember the size of that book). Again, I also think the cinematography was one of the main reasons I enjoyed this film so much. It really pulled me into the story that much more.
