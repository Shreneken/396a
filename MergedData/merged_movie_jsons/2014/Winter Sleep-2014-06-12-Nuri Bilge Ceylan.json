            "content": "Set in Cappadochia, central Anatolia, WINTER SLEEP (KIS UYKUSU) focuses on the life of Ayd\u0131n (Haluk Bilginer) a retired actor who now runs the Hotel Othello. The name is significant, as it reveals his true preoccupation with performance, a trait reinforced by the framed bills on his study wall. With plenty of family money at his disposal he has no need to work, but that does not stop him from screwing every penny out of his tenants with the help of his henchperson Hidayet (Ayberk Pekcan). Although perpetually drawing attention to his poor background and unhappy childhood, it's clear that Ayd\u0131n's life revolves totally around himself; and that the only way he can salve his conscience is to make charitable donations, preferably anonymously. With KI\u015e UYKUSU we are back on thematic territory that director Nuri Bilge Ceylan previously explored in KASABA. He readily acknowledges Chekhov as an inspiration for creating a world where no one has much to do except talk to one another. Ayd\u0131n busies himself with a variety of tasks, including writing a column for the local newspaper and writing a book on the history of the Turkish theater. His sister Necla (Demet Akba\u011f) spends much of her time lolling on the sofa and wondering whether she should forgive her ex-husband for an unhappy marriage. Ayd\u0131n's wife Nihal (Melissa S\u00f6zen) is equally indolent; her sole aim in life seems to be to chair a committee of prosperous locals dedicated to raising money for the local school.Stylistically speaking KI\u015e UYKUSU is slightly different from Ceylan's earlier work; there are fewer reflective sequences designed to prompt reflection on the landscape and the elements, and more face-to-face confrontations between the protagonists. They emphasize the basic emptiness of their lives, as they have nothing to but talk and talk, in contrast to their tenants - for example the local imam Hamdi (Serhat K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7) who wonders about taking a second job so as to make ends meet. On the other hand these lengthy conversations draw attention to the protagonists' love of surfaces; unable (or unwilling) to engage with life's realities, they would rather talk at rather than with one another.The unbelievable landscapes of Cappadochia in winter, with its fairy chimneys and unspoiled Anatolian terrain, offers a point of contrast to the characters' musings. While they spend their time both literally and mentally imprisoned within Ayd\u0131n's hotel, the landscape offers a reminder of timeless virtues, as well as the fact that nature continues to flourish in spite of humanity's best attempts to destroy it.The film comes to a climactic conclusion when Ceylan brings the indolent characters into contact with those forced to eke out an existence in harsh conditions. Nihal offers a financial gift to Hamdi's family; but fails to understand how such an act of apparent goodwill represents the ultimate insult. As Hamdi's brother \u0130smail (Nejat \u0130sler) contends, it is nothing more than conscience money to atone for the fact that Ayd\u0131n's family were responsible for causing \u0130smail's son Ilyas's (Emirhan Doruktutan's) pneumonia earlier on in the film. Meanwhile Ayd\u0131n discovers to his cost that the local educator Levent (Nadir Sar\u0131bacak) has a jaundiced view of all wealthy philanthropists. Yet such experiences do not lead to any form of redemption. The film ends with Ayd\u0131n and Nihal sitting morosely in their deserted hotel, looking out of the window at the snow-covered vista beyond, imprisoned by their lack of perception.This film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes; it deserves every success. A modern classic.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Brace yourself for 3 hours and 19 minutes of heavy listening. Yes, the film was named Palme d'Or at the most recent Cannes, and the dialogue is exceptionally well written, but this isn't one you can just kick back and enjoy. It requires some effort. The two big \"action\" sequences involve a 10 year old boy tossing a rock and later, his too proud father dropping something into a fireplace. The real action occurs between the ears of the viewer as we assimilate the moods and nuances and double-meanings that accompany the stream of conversations.Award-winning director Nuri Bilge Ceylan co-wrote the script with his wife Ebru Ceylan, and that probably attributes to the sharpness and poignancy of the relationships between Aydin (Haluk Bilginer) and his wife Nihal (Melisa Sozen) and his sister Necla (Demet Akbag). Much of the film is devoted to one of two things: Aydin making himself feel important, or Nihal and/or Necla voicing their opinions on why he isn't. While that may sound simple, the wordplay and grounded performances often leave us with the feeling that we are eavesdropping on very private conversations.Filmed in the breathtakingly beautiful Cappadocia region of Anatolia, the geological spectrum contrasts mightily with the near claustrophobic interior scenes that dominate the run time. In fact, when one of the characters does venture outdoors, viewers will find themselves breathing easier and in relief of the stressful intimacy of other scenes.Hotel Othello is cut directly into one of the more picturesque hillsides of the area, and owner Aydin spends his days locked away in his office, kicking off his latest article bashing societal and morality changes within the village. Aydin has a pretty easy life, as he has inherited the hotel and numerous income producing rental properties from his father. Aydin's career as a stage actor also adds a bit to his local celebrity (and ego). He fancies himself an important man with an important voice, and never hesitates to broadcast his charitable offerings.Aydin lives at the hotel with his much younger wife Nihal, and his recently divorced sister Necla. The dysfunction abounds as none of the three much respect the others, and manage to express this in the most incisive, passive-aggressive ways possible. There are two extended (each pushing 30 minutes) exchanges that are unlike anything you may have ever seen on screen. One has Necla letting Aydin know what she thinks of his articles, while the other has Nihal finally coming clean with her feelings of being held back, emotionally captive. Both scenes are captivating and powerful, yet voices are never raised and facial expressions are crucial. This is intimate filmmaking at its best and most uncomfortable psychological warfare would not be too extreme as a description.Conflict is crucial for a dialogue-driven film. Some of the best include My Dinner with Andre, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and 12 Angry Men. These are the type of movies that cause us to study all the subtleties within a scene not just what is said, but how it is said and how the message is conveyed. Pride, loneliness and despair run rampant through the characters here and the philosophical discussions force each to lay bare their soul.For so little action, an undercurrent of wild emotions flows through every scene. In addition to the three leads, there is a character named Hamdi (an Islamic teacher/adviser, played by Serhat Mustafa Kilic) who plays the role of peace-keeper and mediator. His constant smile is but a mask he is forced to wear in his role, and I found his character the most painful of all to watch.The title may be interpreted as either a \"hibernation\" or \"sleep-walking through life's final stages\", and both fit very well. The hotel provides a cave-like hiding place for Aydin, as he pretends to play his final role - that of an important man in the village. There are some truly masterful moments in the film, and it's easy to see why it appeals to only a certain type of film goer. Inspired by the short stories of Chekhov (The Wife, Excellent People), as well as the writings of Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, and Voltaire, means the viewer is investing emotionally in characters quite full of resentment and oh so dishonest with themselves. It's an undertaking that is difficult, but does offer the opportunity to test one's listening skills and ability to read body language. It also comes with wisdom such as Donkeys lead camels (you'll have to watch the movie!).",

            "content": "I had the chance to see tonight this movie in \"Positif\" (a french, highly rated, cinema review) \"avant Premi\u00e8re\". When I made the usual reservation for Positif readers/ subscriber, the reservation told me (and it is listed in the invitation) \"we remind you that this movie lasts 3h and 16 minutes....\". Unusual....I was aware of that, but , as Michel Ciment pointed out, in his introduction, there are 1h 30 minutes movies which seem to last 4 hours....and here, \"on ne voit pas le temps passer\" un-consciously used the title of a song by Jean Ferrat).And, indeed, this is true. Very few \"important\" events happen in the film, but the degradation of the relation between the two main characters takes place little step by little step, and each dialogue is captivating, while the cast (all the cast) is wonderfully playing. Some scenes are surprising by their underneath violence (how a gift turns out to be an insult , and how the outrage is returned, is a flabbergasting sequence) The location in Anatolia, the winter atmosphere, and the remarkable photography adds a piece of charm to the film. At the end, you will remember that it all started by a little stone thrown at a car.... and wonder how you were so much immediately entrapped by the intrigue, so much that it could have lasted as long as the mother and the whore, another lengthy movie, you would not have complained.I do not want to spoil you by describing the plot, but it brings so many reflections about society, aging of a relationship, and a couple, that ... you will want to see it again (which I will certainly do when it is theater released in August). It is an absolute masterpiece, and likely the best film of the decade......(and of course Ceylon best so fat) Go to see it !",

            "review_title": "A masterpiece from one of the greatest film makers of our time",
            "content": "Winter Sleep is a masterpiece by Nuri Bilge Ceylan, a film shining with literary eloquence and incisive social criticism. Aydin (\"intellectual\" in Turkish) is a failed former actor, now a hotel owner with sufficient inheritance to make him command the stage as a condescending \"king\" of a village in Cappadocia. He feels licensed to instruct, intrude and judge, not only on his pitiable tenants, but also on his disaffected young wife Nihal and divorced self-doubting sister Necla. This sentiment ostensibly extends to poor, uneducated and religious classes of the country, making Aydin a stereotype of the Turkish elite. The brutal taming of the horse is an allegory of his marriage; young and pretty Nihal is just another decorative item in his life, not an individual with her own rights and pursuits. Aydin also epitomizes a male-dominated society, cutting across levels of education and affluence. A glimmer of hope comes with a stone breaking the glass. While ruthlessly and decisively able to overpower everyone else in his reign, Aydin is disturbingly challenged by a stubborn 10 year-old boy Ilyas (Arabic equivalent of Elijah, a harbinger of the Messiah). Putting the lens on the perpetually pretending psyche of the western-styled intellectual, Winter Sleep portrays the Turkish nation struggling between the East and the West. Aydin claims to have ideals and ideas but has no intention to make a difference for the good, does not even attempt to empathize with his fellow citizens. His articulate quote from Shakespeare echoes a confession. It's no coincidence that Nuri Bilge Ceylan was charmed by Chekhov, a like-minded author from yet another nation torn between civilizations. Hats off to 2014 Palme d'Or judges for their audacity. By recognizing the value of Ceylan's work, they have enticed global audiences to risk 3 hours 16 minutes of their time to a non-commercial film, a feast of cinematography and acting bundled with literary gratification.",

            "review_title": "Bleak, Deep, Intelligent... Bergmanian...",
            "content": "I didn't know what to expect from Nuri Bilge Ceylan's \"Winter Sleep\", but the title gave me the right hint. I could feel some introspective vibes from that title that sounded like Ingmar Bergman's \"Winter Light\". That the film ran over three hours did scare me a little, I dreaded the borefest but as soon as it started I knew the guide to my journey would be a competent filmmaker who wouldn't indulge into narrative tricks to entertain me. This is a serious and deep movie, that never feels too long or wordy and that can't be labeled as pretentious because it questions and even mocks that elitist pretension.Aydin (Haluk Bilginer) could be the alter-ego of Ceylan, a former actor owning a mountaintop hotel in Anatolia, which is far from the tourism-friendly archetypes associated to Turkey. Don't expect a sunny sky and shades of blue from the Mediterranean sea, we are in a place that is dominated by the natural elements, where urban turmoils have no bearing whatsoever on the inhabitants. It's not exoticism but escapism as those who live here are either too poor to move out or voluntarily exiled themselves from the city, out of an urge to find some inner peace or to fulfill some projects, others are just letting their soul hibernating, hoping for sunnier tomorrows.But isolation can either bring the best or the worst and where Aydin finds inspiration to the columns he writes and his procrastinated project of writing a memoir on Turkish theatre, his younger wife Nihar (Melissa Sozen) and his sister Necla (Demet Akbag) find boredom and desperately look for any possible loophole that can guide them into an oasis of meaning, even artificial. That's the paradox of people trapped together with each one going in one direction, at the end you're estranged to the closest ones. The general idea might sound too pompous but it is handled through powerful conversations where one snarky remark can snowball into more devastating and hurtful comments, revealing the characters' deepest secrets and insecurities.Aydin is a man who never refuses dialogues, he cares about people and is generally ready to listen. But within his own intellectual certitudes, he passes as an arrogant man, incapable to understand the little people, whereas the tenants of the residences he owns, people who live in religion (while he's the educated and open-minded) and with time both his sister and wife also feel belittled. Though Aydin does nothing offensive and insulting, it's all in his attitude, something that is only partially betrayed through little patronizing thoughts he shares here and there or hides behind his eloquence.But I make it sound as if the film doesn't deal with a story, there are events that break the relative monotony. A kid throws a rock on Aydin's jeep, he's the son of Ismail, a man who's been put in jail and whose belongings were confiscated by money collectors (umbeknownst to Aydin). Ismael (Nejat Isler with his piercing eyes) reminded me of the lower-class husband in the Iranian film \"A Separation\", a man incapable to feel empathy toward upper class people no matter how well-intentioned they are. He's a prisoner of his own prejudices and unlike his brother, the local imam, finds refuge in alcohol rather than religion. The brother (Serhat Mustafa Kili\u00e7) constantly sugarcoats his words with syrupy politeness and an exaggerated smile that reinforces Aydin's perception of religious people as hypocrites and bigots.But in one of the most powerful scenes of the film, the sister blames Aydin for being hypocritical too, and judgmental, he condemns people of religion while having never set a food in a mosque and dilutes his frustration in a vain desire to please some fans. It escalates to the point that Aydin as a defensive mechanism insults her, calling her an eternal malcontent venting her post-divorce anger. Later, a similar conversation occurs when he accuses his wife of being too na\u00efve with her fundraising projects and criticizing her lack of bookkeeping skills. Aydin can't realize that this is less a project than an opportunity to give her life a meaning. But we know a bad guy he's not and \"Winter Sleep\" is only the chronicle of isolation and how it makes people drive people into spinning in their own private areas, so much privacy that even when people discuss, you never see them in the same frames, an interesting trick conveying a double isolation.It's an existential condition that Aydin disregards as a luxury, real people have no time for such foolishness; during winter, they have to think of fire, school, food, even hunting. The film takes us to one scene to another where all is up to us is to listen to these people, to their ideas, their perceptions, an inebriated dinner leads a man to quote \"Richard III\" and rejects conscience as a trick used by cowards. In a parallel scene, when Nihar offers money to Ismail's brother out of guilt-stricken charity, Ismail acts as if her good conscience meant absolutely nothing to him. The film shows the eternal gaps between people who can afford thinking and some who can only resign themselves for better or worse, an imam, an alcoholic or a widower who tolerates adversity.Another conversation has the women talk about how we can fight evil by letting him act and see if it can self-destruct, Aydin rejects the idea without realizing that it's the exact way people behave, by surrendering to their own demons while others just let the flow of life drown them and don't bother fighting it. It's easier to deal with the evil that governs us than whatever belongs to the other. And that the most meaningful and humbles words are spoken in voice-over makes the ending bittersweet and frustrating, but so relatable. For a film so rich in communication, it's rather infuriating that a few people really communicate.",

            "review_title": "One Of The Most Engrossing, Mesmerizing & Satisfying Films Of 2014",
            "content": "Winner of the prestigious Palme d'Or at 2014 Cannes Film Festival, Winter Sleep arrives with high expectations but succeeds amazingly well in living up to its new-found honour for this Turkish drama is simply one of the most engrossing, mesmerizing & satisfying narratives to surface on the silver screen in the past year, and is definitely one of the best films of 2014.Set in Anatolia, the story of Winter Sleep concerns Ayd\u0131n; the wealthy owner of a mountaintop hotel who was once an actor but has since fallen into the hibernation mode over the years. The plot covers the chaos his self-involved persona brings to his small kingdom as the animosity of his loved ones & the poor people under his reign begins surfacing once the winter approaches.Directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan, the film takes a very methodical, patient & firm approach with its narrative which does a stellar job in slowly unraveling the inner details of the various characters inhabiting this story. The entire story is an amalgamation of one conversation after another but it's how each discussion begins & ends plus seamlessly switches from one to another that makes it such an immersive experience.The locations are wonderfully chosen, set pieces are finely detailed, the hotel itself creates a calm but secluded ambiance which becomes all the more suffocating on the advent of winter. Camera-work is mostly still yet effective plus the landscapes are beautifully photographed, its 196 minutes of runtime never really bothers for the most part, thanks to its breezy storytelling & the score makes its presence felt just when it's required.Coming to the performances, every single actor here chips in strongly in their given roles & leave nothing to complain about. Haluk Bilginer delivers a magnificent performance as Ayd\u0131n, and is brilliantly supported by Demet Akba\u011f & Melisa S\u00f6zen who play his sister & wife, respectively. The rest of the cast also shines since each character is deftly scripted & gradually developed which differentiates them from caricatures.On an overall scale, Winter Sleep is an intensely gripping, masterfully told & exquisitely layered study of a self-righteous character that also takes an interesting look at failing relationships, old age regrets, class divides, and the morals of right & wrong. And despite its challenging runtime, dialogue-driven plot & slow-burn narration, it manages to be a truly immersive & absorbing cinema that's worthy of your time & money. Highly recommended.",

            "review_title": "A rich portrait of interpersonal tensions and emotional sufferings",
            "content": "Mr Nuri Bilge Ceylan had made adventurous efforts in his movie \"Winter Sleep\". Rewardingly, Palme d'Or Awards was passed onto his hands in 2014. A stunning feature of this movie was the eloquence of major characters. Because of this distinct feature, the audiences need feel comfortable to catch up with a large amount of intellectual debates and accusative questionings between the characters, in order to tap into the characters' inner worlds.During three hours and sixteen minutes, a rich and deep portrait of various emotional sufferings are gradually unfolded. The audiences are exposed to intense conflicts between the rich and the poor, a complacent brother and his critical divorc\u00e9e sister, an egoistic husband and an unhappy young wife and also a naive philanthropist and a resentful villager. Also, there are explosions and accumulations of negative emotional outbursts such as distrust, prejudice, loneliness, fear, suffocation, delusion, cynicism, hopelessness and hatred.While viewing these interpersonal tensions and emotional despairs, it seems to me that our characters were all wearing shackles which had stopped them from finding their true inner strength. For Aydin, the shackle was his distrust and emotional rigidity. For Necla, it was her disapproving attitude and reluctance to change. For Nihal, it was her pessimistic view of her future. For Hamdi, it was his deeply-rooted shame and hatred towards the rich. For Hamid's little son Ilysa, it was his inability to fight against social unfairness. For Hamdi's bother Ismail, it was his involuntary submissiveness and unresisting. And perhaps due to these emotional scars, they all felt deprived of freedom and thus pushed each other into corners in order to feel justified. Mr Nuri Bilge Ceylan opened an abundance of philosophical discussions in this movie. Seemingly he was unwilling to provide effective solution to ease any of these social and interpersonal tensions depicted in the movie. Nevertheless, Mr Ceylan did examine Aydin's self-revelation after he clashed with his sister Necla and his wife Nihal. When Aydin's false ego was badly stricken, the loneliness and pain in Aydin's heart must have been unbearably agonizing. From that moment, the movie started to openly unveil Aydin's vulnerabilities. He contemplated at his parents' graveyard. His messy hair was flying nowhere in the snow, looking terribly sad. When he showed genuine care to the young motorcyclist, that warmth didn't returned back to him. The releasing of a wild horse back to Anatolia steppe could indicate his longing to loosen his own rigidity and forceful mind. While waiting for his run-away train to Istanbul, he frankly demanded the company of his assistance Hidayet. He paid attention to a dead fox lying beside the rails in the snow and even checked birds of prey on the nearby tree. He watched the dying rabbit pitifully during hunting. At the end of the movie, Aydin admitted to himself that he was unable to live through life without Nihal. At this point, when Aydin acknowledged his emotional vulnerabilities, it appeared that he regained his peace and order, and even kicked off his long-term writing project on \"the History of Turkish Theatre\". Aydin perhaps realized that he no longer needed to be the superior one who was emotionally distant to people and himself, who felt like a king by being a columnist in his imaged kingdom, who loved his own civilized manner to contrast others'clumsiness, who was relying on rigidity to feel strong\u0085 Overall, this is a thought-provoking movie, managed by a master director and performed by impeccable cast. I would love to watch this movie again after a few years, as I wish to comprehend more of its richness and depth when life rewards me with more personal experiences.",

            "review_title": "Let Me Give You Western Audiences Some Context, So You Can Have a Better Understanding of Why the Characters in the Film Are Acting the Way They're Acting",
            "content": "As I made it clear in the title, I'll try and explain the characters' behavior, especially Aydin's and Ismail's, by explaining the culture that creates their type of characters. So this is more of a character analysis and its explanation than a review, but I might also review it a little bit. I'm typing this as I go along, bear with me.At the end of the 90s a Korean airline company Korean Air was having significantly more accidents compared to rest of the other airline companies around the world. This was not because of bad pilot training or poor maintenance or old planes, according to a theory the reason was the Korean culture. The theory claimed that the hierarchy and the power dynamics between the pilots, which was demanded by the culture, compromised a healthy communication in the cockpit. The younger person has to respect their elders and superior colleagues to the degree of not correcting their mistakes. Now, I don't know if this theory is 100% correct, but when I first heard this theory, it didn't surprise me at all, and that's the point. Culture has tremendous influence over individuals' behavior in a society. And, every culture has some good sides and then some bad ones, and boy, do we have some bad qualities to our culture here in Turkey...When Ismail picked up the money and threw it in the fire, I immediately thought to myself, most western audiences, especially Americans, will think that that's a very unlikely, unrealistic and far-fetched reaction that would never happen in real life. But to a Turkish audience, that's a very realistic scene. In schools, we are taught stories, in one of which a man chops his own arm because he's pushed too far by the guy who paid to save his life from false prosecution, well it's more complicated than that but you got the point. Why did Ismail, and his brother before him, refused this charity money, which was offered to them by a woman who showed no condescension whatsoever and on the contrary, came with all the best intentions and humility in the world? That's because Ismail has nothing in life other than his empty pride, which he evidently values even more than his son's future. He uses his pride as a cover to hide all his insecurities and inferiority complexes. In the inlands and the eastern parts of Turkey and to some degree in the slums of the big cities, the Turkish culture is to inherit oppression from parents and later, to leave it as a legacy to the children. A kid cannot question anything in life, especially religion. Women can't flirt with guys or else they are sl**s and may even got killed to restore the family's honor which is called ''namus'' in Turkish, a narrower definition of the word, slightly more specific, it is the ''honor'' of your daughter or sister or your mother not having sex or even flirt with anyone in their lives, unless they are married. This oppression prevents the youth from expressing themselves. A teenage boy cannot wear earrings or have a long hair. Girls have to cover their hair, some families start practicing this when the kid's at the age of 5. But of course, not every family is like that. These kids grow up watching the world around them live their lives, while they are oppressed to a crippling state. They become bitter and frustrated. Boys start bullying others, girls become shy nuns who will have bad marriages because they had no experience. And later in their lives, these men will have no qualities as individuals, nor a decent education. They all become ''silent heroes'' with delusions of grandeur that is completely unwarranted. Their sick ''love'' is the purest love in the world, that's why they can't accept rejection and might kill a woman who rejects or attempts to divorce them. Their ''patriotism'' is the highest anyone can have, that's why they are incapable of listening to any nuanced argument of policy, they might kill you because you are a ''traitor'' or even a ''terrorist'' to them because you want a better, secular country that invests in education and science instead of religion and propaganda. Ironically, they are the ones terrorizing the educated and intellectual people in this country, but of course this irony is lost on them. But then again, what does irony mean, try explaining that to them. This society is the major reason of the brain drain from Turkey, not the economy. They do most things banned by their religion, but they criticize others for the same things they are doing, their hypocrisy is only matched by their shamelessness and the lack of a sense of justice. If they are involved in a minor fender bender, they'll come out of their cars yelling expletives and with our version of a baseball bat in their hands, regardless of whose fault the accident is. These sexually frustrated, oppressed, uneducated, brainwashed men proceeds to perpetuate this same culture that has created them. The Turkish right wing has always liked and used these kind of men throughout the history of our country. Their ignorance is easy to weaponize and create a mob to use against their political rivals. And these poor men love the idea of a dictator, they also love mafia figures and make role models of them, because they've been taught to worship power all their lives, not realizing they are the ones who stole their lives from them. These ''silent heroes'' never rise against oppression or power, but they outnumber and gang up on the powerless, because they are very brave, indeed... So, this is the kind of culture that creates Ismail, he would never accept that kind of a charity, let alone from a woman, that's unheard of. He'd rather spend what little money his brother makes, on alcohol, which is very expensive in Turkey. What an honorable and dignified young man, not accepting that charity...Aydin, on the other hand, is not the antithesis of Ismail, not even close, despite his good education. His name 'Aydin' can be translated to English as 'Enlightened' but we use that word interchangeably with 'Intellectual', like most attributes Aydin has, even his name is very on the nose and obvious. Aydin represents the ''intellectual'' and out of touch, disconnected bourgeoisie who takes no responsibility to change the world around them for better, despite their power and influence. When confronted and called out for his selfishness(subtly by the teacher) he cries ''I didn't create the system!'' but he perpetuates and benefits from that broken and unfair system and does nothing to fix it, when he has all the power to do so. He's cynical and pro status quo like most wealthy people. It's so easy a thing to remove oneself from any responsibility or guilt, to convince that it's not your fault, there is nothing you can do about it. This kind of thinking is prevalent all around the world, but we take it to new levels here in Turkey. If you are a good teacher, your colleagues might ask you, sarcastically and condescendingly with a smug smirk in their face, ''Are you an idealist or something?'', as if being an idealist is something bad, something to ridicule... Never do anything to fix anything, why do you think it's your job to fix things? You'll get discouraged even by your parents and family if you want to fix something that's accepted as status quo. No pedestrian is waiting for the traffic lights, why are you? Is something wrong with you? Are you going to save the world by recycling? Aydin might have had a better start in life compared to Ismail, but he's only one generation away from his feudal lord ancestors, which is called ''aga'' in Turkish. His father was the aga(lord) of that village and owned everything in that village. Although we are not given enough information about his parents, knowing that he was an aga, I can assure you that he was not an intellectual nor an educated man. He probably used and oppressed the people like slaves. So Aydin didn't grow up in an ideal environment or with ideal parents either. Perhaps that's why he's so out of touch. He writes his ridiculously out of touch, pseudo-intellectual pieces like criticizing the lack of aesthetics in the poverty-stricken small villages of Turkey that are one step away from famine. Then he publishes these on a local paper which literally has one and a half readers, one of which being his sister and he can't take any criticism from his sole regular reader when she calls him out on his bs. And he is full of bs and he knows it. As he's going through his midlife crisis, deep inside, he slowly understands and accepts that he didn't live up to the expectations, best of his life is behind him and it wasn't very good even at its best. Because he has a problem of expressing his love both to a romantic partner and to his family as well. His ''trophy wife'' loved him at first, I have no doubt, but as time went through, it degraded because of his behavior. Despite all his faults, Aydin is such a likable character, because at this turning point in his life, he's showing some sings of maturing and perhaps change. He's starting to accept that he's full of bs and he admits it in what I assumed was a letter to his wife, at the end of the film. He begs his wife to accept him as he is. And the film ends there, we don't know if his pride will allow him to deliver this letter to her or even if he does, we don't know if his wife is capable of forgiving him any more...Lastly, I'd like to say a few things about Haluk Bilginer(Aydin). He gives such a wonderful performance that he makes a disgusting character somewhat likable, because his acting is so good, it makes the character realistic, instead of what would have been at the hands of a lesser actor, a caricature of a villain. His performance reminded me of Christoph Waltz and his Nazi role in Inglourious Basterds.",

            "content": "The truth is, when you read that this monster of a 3.5 hour film is the shortest 3.5 hour film you would have ever viewed, you don't believe or understand how that could be true... until, at least, you have sat through every satisfying scene of this extraordinary piece of cinema. Every single scene, every single piece of dialogue is acted to and filmed with absolute perfection. The film reels you in from the very beginning and does not let go. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. There is no better way the Director Ceylan could have captured Cappadocia. Having visited myself, I feel as though Ceylan has managed to capture Cappadocia on screen better than I ever saw it through my own eyes in the few days I was there. It is horrifyingly beautiful!!And the main character, Aydin, is a treasure to behold. He is such a talented, but yet flawed man, he is so human. Every character Ceylan has created is so human. That's what makes this film sooo amazing! Every character is so different in nature and personality to the other character, yet we somehow manage to relate to every one of them. This is the kind of film where not much happens, but your jaw drops at every scene because Ceylan has filmed reality better than most of us live it. It is honestly quite scary. Most of our lives mutter on without us ever reflecting on it, properly anyway, because we don't really get the chance. However, when you watch Winter Sleep you can see a part of yourself in pretty much every character. You understand every person's actions in the film and there is no greater exemplification that, at least between the three main characters, the line of good and bad is ever so blurred. Everyone has their reasons, everyone has good intentions, but yet people just cannot get along harmoniously because they are naturally different.Anyway, without going too far, the film is deep, and very interesting to watch. However, at the same time, the film is extremely humorous. Not your typical 'comedy.' In fact, if you like 'comedy' you probably won't laugh once during this film. The film is such an accurate portrayal of reality that it is funny. Watching the films as Turks, ourselves, the depiction of Turkish society, the mannerisms, the behaviourisms, and the actions of the characters, it's akin to living and breathing Turkish culture. I can think of many examples throughout the film, but without extending my review too long, I will only provide one example. For instance, in almost every scene, the characters are drinking tea. So typical. In another scene, as soon the characters finish drinking tea, coffee is ordered. It's not just the outcome, though, that is funny. It's the way Ceylan has captured the scene...so brutally honest, there is no sway from reality whatsoever. I was honoured to be one of the first to watch this film at the Nova Exclusive in Melbourne. We were born and bred in Australia, but our Turkish culture is still imminent in us. This film is so universal everyone can enjoy it, yet somehow it is such an accurate depiction of Turkish culture and manifests the problems we humans all face across the globe - it really is no different no matter what nationality, culture or race you come from - ultimately, we all have to deal with relationship dilemmas!!I found it amazingly funny in an interview I read with the director Ceylan who responded to the potential dark humour in the film...\"I don't do comedies - I don't like laughing\" - or something along those lines. Just as he muttered those words he burst into laughter himself. Ceylan has a tack for intellectual art. He has created something so beautiful it will require many repeated viewings just to digest the full glory of this masterpiece. I would love to re- watch it immediately!!",

            "review_title": "From Shakespeare to Sartre: Excellence",
            "content": "I've spent a long time to write a comment on this movie, as I couldn't rely on my judgment about Nuri Bilge Ceylan, who is one of the best directors that Turkish cinema could have ever nurtured; so it took a very long time. Finally I've come up with something to say. If you're one of the people who's always looking for something worth watching and who are sick of superficial movies with clich\u00e9 stories, Winter Sleep is what you need. For my point of view, this is Ceylan's second best after Uzak (Distant), the movie which also conquered Cannes Film Festival and many other international festivals.You don't need to know the story \u2013 there isn't one. There are only 3 basic characters, let's say, three reflections of beings represented by real actors of this life. It's not a coincidence that the lead character of the movie was once used to be an actor in the story. And Ceylan is using the actor's real life images on stage to dramatize the effect. So it's not easy not to think of what the real actor has done in real life, who also performed in Shakespeare Globe Festival in Antonius and Cleopatra in UK, and the photo background in his room is quite visible. The character always speaks of the virtues \"conscience\" and \"morality\", none of which he has, and also he uses the word \"ignorance\" as if he is in a war with it. He might not seem ignorant to you, but deep down, he is ignorant to what he is and everyone around him. He is like the emperor over a small capitalist system he's created and looking down on everyone as if they were beneath him. This is why he is struggling so hard to make everyone think that he's got all these virtues. However, just like Sartre's play \"No Exit\", it is through your actions and by other's reflections upon you that you can define yourself. In Ceylan's play, three main characters of \"No Exit\" is Aydin, his wife Nihal and his sister Necla. Knowing there's no escape in facing the reality, to what he truly is, the fear of losing overtakes him. Either he has to accept his \"essence\", or leave \u2013 a spoiler: he can't leave. He must be in \"hic et nunc\", he is unable to leave.As a reminder of a play in the movie, Shakespeare's play \"Richard III\" has the most striking quote of the movie: \"Conscience is but a word that cowards use, devised at first to keep the strong in awe\". , stating Aydin's fear of exposing his true identity and using \"morality\" as a tool to fight it. The word \"conscience\" has sickened his wife, Nihal, who can't accept him for what he is anymore, but she isn't able to \"choose\" her identity either. Therefore she is stuck with him. And his sister Necla disappears right after the truth is spoken to her face: she has done her part in the play.I must say I am amazed by all the references in the movie and it doesn't really need a plot. Ceylan has outdone himself in writing the scenario and of course, most applause should go to the actors who have done an incredible job, especially Haluk Bilginer in creating such an ambiguous character.And thank you Ceylan for speaking up for what is silenced in Turkey, this movie's going to be remembered with one of Cannes Festival's photos, the lead actors holding the text #Soma.

            "content": "\"You always float to the surface like olive oil.\" Necla (Demet Akbag)Although the landscape of Turkey's Anatolia region could have been the center of Winter Sleep, its rugged terrain is not. The heart of this dark world as it prepares for winter is Aydin (Haluk Nilginer), a wealthy landlord and former actor, whose challenges are rent-delinquent commoners and a rebellious young wife, Nihal (Melisa Sozen), who has attained an identity as a seeker of charity for villagers. As his sister suggests above, he has the ability to dominate and set himself apart like olive oil, being nearly lonely with his power.Almost as if director Nuri Bukge Ceylan had wanted not to recreate Dr. Zhivago, this wintry drama (over 3 hours) is not romantic in a traditional sense: no swelling music, no smothering snow, just characters in close quarters gaining warmth from their fires and from their universal need for love. Even Aydin struggles to understand and shepherd Nihal into his conservative world of judgment and accountability as he forces his way into her charity's books to protect her and probably his fortune.When a small boy throws a rock at Aydin's car window, a chain of events unleashes to draw together two proud worlds\u2014owner and vassal\u2014to reconcile pride and owed rent. Running parallel is his fight against Nihal's pride and his own paternalistic intrusion into her world, where he can be counted on to snoop.That's partly because he writes a column in the local newspaper that covers oddities, for Aydin, like a local imam, whose great sin seems to be that he's unkempt and doesn't carry himself like a cleric should. Aydin's sister is there to point out his arrogance and to remind us that even in this remote world human beings can show their pride as well as any American politician.This Palme d'Or winner at Cannes is as commanding as the best laid thriller except that its dialogue is demanding and its sensibility way out of the ordinary, even for the notoriously distancing Steppes. Winter Sleep is neither cold nor soporific\u2014it is life.",

            "content": "This is probably the slowest film I've ever seen where I was invested the whole time. That's quite a feat considering the film's glacial pace and 196-minute run time. I'll admit I don't watch a lot of foreign movies, but I'll go out of my way if I feel they're worth checking out. I heard how slow this movie was, so I went in somewhat cautious. Don't get me wrong, some of my favorite movies are quite slow, such as The Bird People In China and There Will Be Blood. However, I have my limits. I have respect for the artistic merit of films like Solaris, Satantango, Werckmeister Harmonies, and The Turin Horse, and I get what they're going for thematically, but JEEZ, can we please move on? I probably sound like an ignorant jackass for saying that, but hey, that's my honest opinion.Did I fall asleep during Winter Sleep? Despite the fact that I started the movie at 9:00 pm and it didn't finish until after midnight, the answer was surprisingly no. In my opinion the film is perfectly paced for the story it wants to tell, slow enough that you feel the pace of life in the mountains of central Turkey but just fast enough to keep things moving along. The acting and dialogue are the two things that drive the film, and both are executed beautifully. All of the actors were fantastic and felt like real people. The fact that I don't recognize any of them probably helped, but even in a foreign language film its not hard to spot weak acting. Not a whole lot happens in the film, but the film remains engaging because we care about these believable, relatable characters. Movies like Lord of The Rings: The Return of The King or The Ten Commandments are engaging throughout their 200+ minute run times simply because so much happens in them that you sort of need it to be that long. For the first hour of Winter Sleep, I wasn't really sure where the film was going, but things kept escalating and tensions kept building. By the two and a half hour mark, I was on the edge of my seat, anxious (in a good way) to see how the climax would play out. If a film comprised entirely of 15-minute scene after 15-minute scene of people talking can keep me anticipating what happens next, it must be doing something right.The film is beautifully shot. We get some beautiful scenery outdoors in addition to some nice cinematography for the indoor scenes. (not really a spoiler) I like how some of the more pivotal scenes are lit only with the flickering light from a fireplace, reflecting the characters' emotional intensity. There's some interesting symbolism and religious/social themes sprinkled throughout as well.My only complaint with the film is it gets too philosophical and political at points for my taste. There are times where characters will talk about Islam, the Turkish government, and other things for like five minutes at a time. While it technically helps develop the characters and fits with the plot thematically, I felt that some of it was unnecessary and could have been cut. There are times where its needed for the plot though, like when Aydin berates his wife about laws regarding taxation on donation money (not really a spoiler).Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this film. If you sit back and let the film suck you in, you'll find yourself engaged. It isn't for everybody, but those willing to stick it out will hopefully find it rewarding.",

            "content": "Aydin (Haluk Bilginer) is a wealthy man, a former actor who now runs a hotel in Cappadocia. He also writes a column for the local newspaper, and is researching for his planned book about the history of Turkish theater. Nihal (Melisa S\u00f6zen) is his beautiful and much younger wife. Necla (Demet Akbag) is his divorced sister. Also involved the family of Aydin's poor tenants who could not pay their rent for several months already. The friendly and gregarious Hamdi appeals for compassion, while his older brother, the impetuous jobless ex-con Ismail and his sullen young son Illyas, could not hide their contempt for their landlord. This film is about the various conversations and confrontations between these people. These may begin as abstract debates about not resisting evil or boredom or donations, yet they all end up being very personal. There is no real plot, just a lot of seemingly random dialogue. Although, there are arguments that seemed endless and repetitive, these confrontations were eloquently written with very meaningful words for both sides of the issue. These long talky scenes were riveting despite their length and you hang on to every word they were saying. The performances of the actors of these flawed characters were faultless and so natural.The cinematography of this film is so amazingly beautiful as it magically captured the unique topography of Cappadocia during the wintertime. There were several picture-perfect haunting scenes throughout, specially those about the Anatolian horse, the cemetery, the train tracks, the tree with the birds, the rabbit in the brush, the town, the hotel -- all covered with pristine snow. The close-ups of the actors were all so perfectly framed to achieve maximal drama. The use of mirrors to vary the camera shots were very good. I admit that the 3-hour and 16-minute length of this film can be felt. However, you do not really mind this time running as you listen to intellectually-stimulating emotionally-rich conversation. This film is a masterpiece of world cinema by acclaimed Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan, truly worthy of its Palme d'Or during the Cannes Film Festival this summer. This should be a shoo-in to at least be nominated for the Oscar for Best Foreign Language film. 9/10.",

            "content": "Nuri Ceylan's Winter Sleep explores the need to find values one can live by in the contemporary world free of religious trappings. Set and filmed in rural Turkey it represents the elemental pivot point between Islam and the West.The film is essentially the anatomy of Aydin, a secular intellectual/artist/businessman, who pretends to conscience and morality as he judges (and oppresses) others but falls well short on both counts himself, frozen by his arrogance. Aydin has retreated to run a small hotel which he keeps \"natural,\" preferring muddy roads over gravel. His inherited property made him wealthy, a condition he also defends as \"natural.\" He writes a weekly column in a small local paper, but won't venture into a major publication. When Aydin gets an email from a local teacher he summons his wife and neighbour to hear her adulation, under the pretence of asking their advice on responding to her request for financial help.Ceylan makes Aydin admirable and sympathetic, then gradually exposes him. His vanity in reading that email is our first clue to his failings, as well as his alienation from his wife Nihal. At first a beautiful enigmatic phantom, she emerges as a repressed, young woman who has finally found self-realization in running a charity project. Aydin spoils that by taking over her bookkeeping. He suspects the others of fraud and wants to preserve their family name. That, we later learn, he has already compromised when he turned earthquake victims away from his hotel in order to accommodate the paying members of relief agencies. His association, not Nihal's inexperience, would poison her project. Aydin also tries to remove himself from what's happening around him. When a second- generation tenant falls into rental arrears, Aydin claims his assistant Hidayet and his lawyers do everything on their own. Aydin feels no responsibility for the cruelty a wild horse suffers when caught for him. Aydin frees the horse when he leaves Nihal and sets out for Istanbul. He is jolted into self-awareness when he instead goes for a drunken evening and morning hunt with neighbour Suavi and schoolteacher Levent. Levent's babble confronts Aydin with his earthquake shame. The combination of brandy and guilt give the controlled and controlling Aydin his first breakdown. He vomits. The next morning he shoots a rabbit and finds it, still quivering with last life. That breaks down the detachment he has maintained between himself and the abuses of nature he has ordered, whether toward animals or his tenants. He returns to beg Nihal to forgive and to stay with him. His catharsis awakens him from his winter sleep.In a breakfast conversation Necla proposes to confront evil by submitting to it. She postulates that instead of resisting evil, thus further provoking its agent, by submitting to it one can perhaps arouse the malfeasant's conscience. She even considers asking her drunken ex-husband to forgive her for divorcing him, in hopes that might convert him to sobriety. \"Islam,\" of course, means \"submission,\" though that usually refers to Mohammad not to evil. In addition to his secularity, the other Islamic cornerstones that Aydin violates are brotherhood and charity. Neighbour Suavi is literally what Aydin is metaphorically: a lonely isolate, who after his wife's death closed off several rooms and retreated to his living room stove. But Suavi has warm relationships with others, like the teacher, and he has actively joined Nihal's project. Aydin's callous treatment of his suffering tenants and the earthquake incident prove his total lack of charity. When he gives Nihal a large donation it's to try to buy off her anger at his intrusion. Of course, he tells Suavi and Levent about his \"anonymous\" gift to bolster his image. His \"charity\" is disqualified by his self-interest.When Nihal gives that money to the unfortunate tenants she turns his conscience money to effective use.That family is a microcosm of current Islam. The younger brother Hamdi is the local imam, who gives sermons and struggles on a small salary to support his jobless older brother Ishmael, his sister-in-law and nephew, and their aging, ailing and ungrateful mother. Despite their long tenancy, Aydin has allowed the family to be dunned by a collection agency, the police, and confiscators of their TV and other goods. Ishmael was humiliated by an assault in front of his family. Hamdi serves the community with Koranic wisdom. But he can't mediate between the wealthy landlord and the violent rebel. Hamdi reluctantly accepts the money from Nihal, but Ishmael proves self-destructive in his sense of violated honor. Ishmael went to jail for stabbing a brute who stole his wife's underwear and then teased him. Now, as he recounts his various shame by Aydin, he rejects the money that would restore his family's honour and throws it in the fire. \"Ishmael,\" of course, was Hagar's son, the original Moslem banished from Abraham's family. The original Moslem here becomes the first radical. The Grade V boy Ilyas is an intensely resentful figure who stones the landlord's van, then falls into a faint and a fever when his imam uncle tries to get him to apologize to Aydin and kiss his imperious hand. If Ishmael's burning of the money evokes the self- destruction of the Islamic militant, son Ilyas represents the outer-directed destruction to come.",

With the arrival of a snowy winter, the relationships between the three deteriorate to a disturbing extent.There is little physical violence in the movie (a slap in the face and an animal shot dead), but the amount of psychological conflict is unsettling.

But I do know one thing, I was all emo and then that Creepo walked in and I said outloud 'Oh no! F mE!' cause I had all these plans for that money that might palliate a bit of that wretched families' terrible woebegones but dang, dang, just really cool!",

            "content": "How can you embody so many themes in one single movie with such great care and dedication? This motion picture lets you see everything you want to see and perhaps even more. With this I'll also add, its quintessentially a Nuri Bilge Ceylan film, so you cant expect any over- the-top gesture or quirk. Its life at its natural pace. Whether an audience sees it or not, its there, in all its beauty and tragedy.Aydin (Haluk Bilginer) runs a small hotel in Anatolia with his wife Nihal (Melisa Sozen) and his sister Necla (Demet Akbag). His life appears to be a serene one at first. He seems calm, handles everything with care, looks as if he has a grip on almost everything. But does he?When the film begins we have no idea who these people are and by the film ends, its as if we know their core, so much so that its shocking. That is the power only possessed by great films, which this one is, in my mind.With this film, Ceylan has reached to a whole other level of film- making. He not only co-wrote some of the best conversations ever to be captured on film, but also had the ability to stage and dramatize it. On a personal level, I just feel this is that kind of a film which would be cathartic for some, highly profound for others and some might just find it boring owing to its length. But one thing is certain, it has captured the truth of the characters as one would catch lightening in a bottle (if one ever could). Its worth a watch, at least once, and that goes for every single person on earth!Do catch it sometime.",

This way you get a lot of outdoor scenes that have no value, including the first frames, and quite a few of driving scenes also with no value.About an hour into the movie and I was wondering what am I doing in the room? I thought about asking my money back. But the power of \"what if\" was stronger. At the two hour mark my butt was hurting. And the story was getting worse.In the end the best part of this movie is getting outside and being able to move.So far, this is the worst Ceylans script. Almost every scene is explained after the action. You could guess some of the explanations, which makes the continuation of those particular scenes redundant. Other scenes remain cryptic, probably some Turkish custom badly explained.All I am left after wasting three hours is a shapeless mash. Is it about religion? Religion pops into the story in a pointless way that might mean meaningful message. But there is no religion in the end. Is it about the Turkish folk? But the folk are badly represented. Is it about Turkish intelligentsia? But they are also badly represented. Is it about education in Turkey? About a brother and a sister? About a wife and her much older husband? At the three hour mark the film or hard drive runs out. You get a regular cast and crew list on screen. But is it really over? This is a movie about everything. It ends up about nothing.

            "content": "After waiting nearly a year, I was finally able to see the film that won Cannes in 2014, Winter Sleep, also the first film I've seen from Turkey. Winter Sleep is a sober, serious film, centering on Ayd\u0131n, a wealthy hotel-owner and landlord, his much younger wife Nihal and his sister, Necla. Ayd\u0131n's vehicle window is smashed by a young son of a tenant, furious over having their possessions confiscated for months of unpaid rent. The boy's uncle tries to patch things up, but Ayd\u0131n is unimpressed with his tenants. Suffering from hard luck, they see Ayd\u0131n as a tyrant, though he doesn't personally manage his properties. Winter Sleep is overlong and slow but not really boring. The main drama is the emotional drama in Ayd\u0131n arguing with Necla and Nihal, who both seem interested in breaking away from him. Necla picks at Ayd\u0131n's writings as safe and presumptuous in dealing with topics Ayd\u0131n doesn't know about; any writer will appreciate how that feels. Nihal is annoyed with him for meddling in her charity work late in the game. Then at the end, the tenants refusing Nihal's charity- indeed, throwing the equivalent of thousands of dollars in cash on the fire- is striking. This is a man insulted by charity from the \"oppressor.\" I do feel a little sorry for Ayd\u0131n- his sister and wife seem to do next to nothing, but are unappreciative of him, and he is unaware of some of the harsher acts done in his name.I liked Winter Sleep; it's a solid film, not much to dislike. But I can't say I was wowed by it- I wasn't devastated by it, or particularly moved by it. Even though it won Cannes, I can still understand why it missed a nomination by the Academy, and why they showed their love to Ida (2013) instead.",

            "review_title": "Disconnect, separation and making the best of what you have",
            "content": "Winter Sleep is a long movie. At three hours and 15 minutes, this film will make you actually look at your clock before hitting play. It won Palm d'Or at Cannes and I had no idea of any of this until I saw it on Netflix this week. There's a lot of substance to this movie and a great deal can be said and debated philosophically. I'll just stick to what really stood out for me.The Disconnect Between ClassesAydin, the protagonist of the movie, is a wealthy man, well educated and, in kid mind, generous and kind to those around him. What becomes apparent early on in the film is that he is also detached from the practical ongoings of his estate. His property is rented out and managed by lawyers and helpers, he does not know his own tenants, and he's oblivious to the issues they are having.When a kid breaks his car window with a stone, he's shocked and surprised. He does not realize that debt collectors and the police had a conflict with the kid's father, that the father has no job, and that they live of one person's wage. If this were a more predictable film, you would expect Aydin to realize these details. It doesn't happen! In fact, the only way Aydin tries to help the less fortunate is by donating a great sum of money to the charity his wife, Nihal, is organizing.This same disconnect is present in my own life, and likely in the life of many of the people around me in the same social class and age group. Our idea of helping the less fortunate is donating to charity once a year or jumping on some online viral bandwagon every so often. And do we really do it to help, or do we do it to help ourselves feel good?Just like Aydin writes a weekly column in the local paper, so do we write our blogs and Tweets and Facebook posts preaching whats's right and showing off our opinions and moral stances. But in the end, how many of us actually take action or speak from experience rather than simply from philosophical realms?The Physical SeparationWhat is captivating about the movie from the get-go is the setting. It's filmed in Cappadocia, Anatolia, a region of Turkey. The landscape and the homes are truly unique. Aydin lives with his wife and sister in a hotel they own. This hotel is built into the mountain, in a way, and it has the feeling of a castle. Aydin is like a kind ruler, and this castle is separating him from the rest of the people, adding to the idea of disconnect.While he sees himself as a sort of benevolent ruler, we quickly see that practically nobody feel this way about him and he's actually disliked even by his own family. His helper runs all errands, and the ruler sits oblivious in his tower. His sister challenges his moral standpoint on the notion of evil; his wife feels like a prisoner with no purpose in life; his subjects despise him behind his back.This separation does not happen only in remote regions. This separation is a daily reality in the society we live in. Very few people live in communities where they interact with their neighbours, or even with their own family. People are separated by vast geographical distances, going far from home in search of materialistic gains. And even those who stay close often just shut themselves in, watching Netflix all day or spending hours on their smart phones. Aydin fails to see past the his own mountain fortress. We fail to see past our computer screens.Making the Best of What You HaveSad ideas aside, there is a sense of redemption buried somewhere in the snow. Aydin claims he worked all his life, and it is only in his old age that he's as wealthy as we see him. Maybe it's unfair to judge him so harshly. Maybe he was not really meant to be a ruler and his detachment is a byproduct of his lack of interest and his moral high ground. He used to be an actor and his current goal is to write a book on the history of Turkish theater. That's not so wrong, is it? A quiet life on top of a mountain, removed from the problems of the village? Isn't that what many of us want after a life of work?And what about the tenants who failed to pay rent for many months? If they lived in Canada, they would have been kicked out a long time ago! It's clear that even though the people around Aydin are unhappy, he's actually content with his station in life. He tells Nihal that he still realizes the value of having a warm room and a roof over his head, while she talks about doing greater things in life. I couldn't help but agree with Aydin: we often forget what we have and, like Nihal, we get stressed with wanting more and more from life. A simple shift in focus could make us happy: just focus on what you have and consider that billions of others would give anything to have a full fridge, a warm house, and people who love them.There: I tried to end it on a more positive note! Hope you will watch this long but rewarding movie! Thank you for reading.",

But sometimes you use those virtues to suffocate people, to crush and humiliate them.\"-NihalLisbon & Estoril Film Festival #1This was the first time I attended the Lisbon & Estoril Film Festival, this year being its 8th edition. This year's festival opened up with a must see, Winter Spleep, a film I absolutely could not wait to watch. It has gotten a lot of great buzz around it, especially since it won the Palm d'Or back in May, which basically catapulted this film into the radar of all movie lovers. I went in with reserves still, because I mean, it's a two hundred minute movie and it is not every picture that can own that run-time, still I was excited and hoping for great things.We follow the mountains and the landscapes of the startling and breathtaking Anatolia, in Turkey. Winter has arrived for these poor, distanced, isolated villages and with it some cold winds and trouble have to come stay. Aydin is a retired theater actor, a rich, influential man within the villages near him. He has now settled down in his hotel in central Anatolia. He seems to be lonesome but mildly happy and satisfied with the life he leads, a simple life that one is. He writes for the local newspaper, he writes about too important matters for such a small newspaper which no one reads. He's working on his new book about the Turkish theater and this way, he's able to keep focus and not lose his mind for the hopeless silence and isolation of the landscapes.Trouble starts when a family, who has lived in a house that Aydin has rented them for many years, can't pay him for their stay in the house. Has a consequence, Aydin's lawyers are obliged to go and rifle that family's belongings and leaving them with little to live with, even their dignity. Aydin, knows little about the matter and lets the lawyers and his friend Hidayet to take care of the problem.The first episode happens when a child, that leaves in that house with his poor family, hits Aydin's car with a rock and consequentially breaking his car window and almost making a car accident happen. Aydin and Hidayet take the child back home, where his father is waiting. The child is soaking wet, since he had fallen in a river while trying to run way. It is here that we have a confrontation between the man who has seen his dignity and the dignity of his family taken away because of their lack of economical possibilities and the man who's basically, even if in an incidental way, the one who has taken it. This is a 5 minute dialogue, which starts very quiet, building up an unbearable tension until a climax that felt unavoidable.That's basically what the film is all about, the movie is narratively driven by its dialogue. The film is divided into a more or less episodic series of dialogues where people ultimately lose control, let their masks fall and speak their mind, even at times more with the purpose of hurting each other, more than to have an actual argument. There's a clear contrast here between the pale, quiet beautiful natural backgrounds and the strain and hate that's being unleashed. We are talking about twenty minutes sequences of just dialogue, some may be even longer. This could have resulted in a bore but it doesn't, because we can totally relate to some of the dialogues that always feel genuine and because they are so compelling, rich and filled with several layers of development. Almost every single sequence, ultimately leads up for a quiet climax (when it comes to sound) but a catastrophic one to the characters that we are following.Winter Sleep was far from being a bore at the theaters, the environment was fantastic, the film does have its wits, whimsical moments that often resulted in huge laughs and I thought the run- time was totally bearable, but yeah I mean it is a two hundred minute picture and I think it's safe to say that the movie extends its visit for a little too long. I had had a long day behind me and I started to feel the weight of its run-time in the last forty minutes or so. My numbing neck and aching legs probably didn't help, so I was a bit inpatient for the film's ending. I was impatient because the film was starting to lose me, the dialogues were no longer grabbing as tight and because I wanted to know in what note this film would end.When it comes to craft, well this is pretty much spotless. Cinematography is gorgeous, some tremendous images go through the screen through its run time. It's not only well crafted when it comes to cinematography for example but also when it comes to storytelling. Narratively it's bold and engaging and it creates its own set of rules.Winter Sleep is a film that I respect massively, I probably have to say though, that I respect it more than what I actually enjoyed it. It's a huge, colossal film that nearly owns it's two hundred minutes, even if it was way too much for my numbing back and drained energy. It's a film that will surely only be appreciated by a small amount of people, Nuri Bilge Ceylan has gained in me a follower but I don't believe he will make many friendships with main audiences who will soon discard such a long, slowly paced Turkish drama. It is a challenging film that ultimately rewards its audience with some powerful images and palpable strain. The audience in the theater seemed to be in awe, me I was simply left satisfied and with a huge respect for the piece.Rating:B-",

Socially inspired as an actor, heartless as a landlord.Aydin accuses Nihal of being naive in her welfare work. The intentions are good, the results are sometimes counterproductive.Both accusations contain an element of truth.The problem of this movie is not that it contains so much dialogue, the problem is the static way in which this dialogue is portrayed. In one scene Aydin does not have a discussion with his wife but with his friends during a reunion meal. When the evening progresses and everyone has had a few glasses of wine, the debate grows more intense and dynamic.

            "content": "I guess if I were looking at this movie the 'right' way, Aydin (Haluk Bilginer) would be the bad guy of the piece. He had the temerity to expect payment of rent from long delinquent tenants, he and friend Hidayet (Ayberk Pekcan) returned a young boy to his home after the kid threw a rock at their car breaking a window, he tried to reason with his wife Nihal (Melisa S\u00f6zen) over being excluded from a meeting in his own home regarding her charitable work, and endured a long conversation with his divorced sister Necla (Demet Akbag), who admitted that she had never seen any of the plays he had written. The crux of the story seemed to rest in Aydin's relationship with his wife in a marriage that had hit an impasse after many years. She stated that he was selfish, spiteful and cynical, and maybe he was, but the story didn't really seem to lay out those qualities in the man. What it did seem to reveal was Aydin's compulsion to insert himself in Nihal's charitable work against her will, but at the same time, she appeared to be entirely secretive about it, enough to raise some kind of suspicion. And then there was the business about the burning money. I'm not sure why Ismail (Nejat Isler) would have considered it an insult, but he only added to the affront by destroying what was offered in good faith. If he was that perturbed about accepting charity, he could have used it to pay the rent he owed Nihal's husband, and used the experience to help him get back on his feet again. So maybe for this viewer, there's some sort of cultural divide that clouds my understanding of what director Nuri Bilge Ceylan was trying to achieve here. I can say that the effort was made somewhat compelling with the distinctive photography amid a rather harsh landscape. But all too often, I was left frustrated by a host of characters always attempting to sort things out without ever doing so. Maybe my problem is that I relate to the character of Aydin so much that I don't see the faults that other viewers do. Be that as it may, my opinion of the picture doesn't extend to other Turkish films, as I found both \"The Bandit\" and \"My Father and My Son\" to be more accessible in terms of understanding what those pictures were trying to say.",

            "content": "Cannes seem to have a theme as of late for selecting 3 hour films for their coveted Palm d'or with Nuri Bilge Ceylan's latest and Blue Is The Warmest Colour. However, Winter Sleep's mammoth 196-minute length should not be solely be considered a challenge. In fact, it was perhaps the most leisurely viewing I had while at the festival outside of Whiplash. It's a warm character study, one that takes its time to burrow deeply into its topics. That's the notable personality of Winter Sleep for how it feels novelistic in its approach. It doesn't necessarily have more scenes than the average film, nor does it cover more time, instead it's full of extended dialogue driven scenes that stir gently and dig thoroughly to make their points. It's an intellectual feast on a literary scale.The film details the winter of a middle-aged hotel owner Alydin, played by Haluk Bilginer, and his relationships with his recently divorced sister, his young wife, acquainted guests, his friends and employees, and the tenants of houses he owns. He's a former thespian of the theater and a minor celebrity, though he's currently working on a book about the history of Turkish theater while he runs the Anatolian village. He's both generous and egotistical, considered the king of his small kingdom, having ownership rights to most of the houses and shops in the town. Through ordeals with his wife's charity, his sister's misery and a family struggling to pay rent, he wrestles with the morality of his altruism, despite lack of activism, as those dependent on him only resent him in returnWritten by Ceylan and his wife Ebru Ceylan, Winter Sleep does feature familiar archetypes of those with power and how they choose to use it. However, it spends time peeling back their layers and making them more human and conflicted characters. Scenes often take ten minutes to get their points, but it holds us with every articulate word. As a result, it has a very natural delivery of exposition, one delightfully deliberately crafted moreso than a taunt film. Plot threads are neither forced open nor closed. It's sprinkled with lyrical visual metaphors between the conversations that whilst obvious, they are very powerful, feeding into the character development. All the cast from top to bottom live in their character's skin in vivid detail, particularly from Bilginer and Melisa Sozen, who's vulnerable performance leaves the lasting impression of the supporting cast.Like with his previous film Once Upon A Time In Anatolia, one of the best films of its year, it's visually stunning. It may not have the same bravura as the former with ambitious camera movements, but it's just as sharp and striking, though with a kinder and more intimate approach to its network of characters. Ceylan has a careful and poetic use of space, light and movement in the simple interior scenes and every frame expresses so much. But it's also grand from the wide expanses of the snowy Anatolian mountains and from the harshness of the cold outdoors to the warmth of the rooms, the atmosphere feels palpable and immersive. It definitely makes the length and pace easier, along with its endearing sense of humour.However, it is hard to ignore that it feels like it panders to critics a little bit. There are too many unnecessary mentions of the craft and criticism of acting and writing. It feels extraneous to its main focuses. Unlike Once Upon A Time In Anatolia, which had fascinating ideas about the nature of truth and how we'll never know it, even if we witness events firsthand, Winter Sleep doesn't overtly have a universal point to make outside of its specificity to its characters and country, illustrating the divide between the powerful and powerless, but that's satisfying enough. It's a thoroughly engrossing, thoughtful and beautiful film and if the length doesn't intimate Academy voters too much, this is an easy frontrunner for the Foreign Language Film Oscar.8/10Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com/)",

            "content": "With his latest, Winter Sleep, Nuri Bilge Ceylan's characteristic obsession with his country's variegated topography takes him to Cappadocia, a remote stretch of the Anatolian countryside whose strange mound-like formations provide the backdrop for an intimate tale of marital take-and-no-give that's been stretched (for no apparent reason other than indulgence) to over three hours. Much like the lead character, a charismatic former actor who now runs the Hotel Othello, Ceylan's film doesn't know when to let an argument rest. The obvious analogue here would be Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage; the key difference lies in Winter Sleep's absolute refusal to let anything be at emotional stake. The husband expounds, his wife or sister rebuts, and then he uses his considerable rhetorical acumen to put them in their place. A subplot dealing with a dispute between the hotelier and his tenant farmers seems left over from an earlier film. And in case there were any doubt as to the fatuousness of Ceylan's approach here, look no further than an excruciatingly protracted scene involving an envelope stuffed with money and a crackling fireplace telegraphs its inevitable conclusion from the start. Perhaps such inexorability is Ceylan's true theme. If so, he still has to answer for taking nearly forever to get there.",

Comparisons to Shakespeare overlook the fact that Shakespeare is a marvel of economy - and also that he wrote action plays, by and large. Each of the dialogs is well-written - but there are too many of them. And with all the talk, some important points of character are never resolved. The central character is Aydin, a retired actor and heir to a number of rental estates in Anatolia. His wife is decades younger. How did they meet? How did the unlikely marriage take place? What did she want or expect? Etc.None of this is addressed - instead everything is expressed in present tense. No one except Necla (Aydin's sister) has a personal history, and even that is only partially described. But all of this is actually pretty important to understanding how they came to where they are.I don't mind pictures in which nothing much happens, which is certainly this one. I do have a problem with movies that seem premised on the notion that simple artiness is sufficient. It isn't.Finally, the incredibly dull musical score consists of various piano selections from the romantic masters - sort of like that Bergman picture in which the only music was a Bach unaccompanied cello suite. That tells you all you need to know.",

However, this film has a rhythm and vitality few films of Chekhov have offered. The exotic setting accounts for some of this. Mr. Bilginer's magnetism, conveyed in his husky voice and exquisitely trained eyes, lifts every scene he is in to a high level of tension and engagement.This is not a moralistic film, in my opinion. It is, as the castrating Necla says while needling her brother, \"realistic\". It displays human nature with its flaws without harsh commentary. The characters themselves do all the judging and muddling. Nihal feels she is a strangled Desdemona despite her accommodating Othello's (Aydin's) tolerance of her youthful angst. Necla lives off her brother and resents it. Aydin is an enabler and insecure in his own worth.Aydin is the misunderstood patriarch. He doesn't even understand that he is a patriarch, no matter what good he feels he is doing. He fails to see the real context of his part on the stage of his environment. He is the gentrified landlord, but sees himself as an innocent businessman in a system he did not create. Nihal fails to understand her charity is selfish and lacks human understanding. Necla talks about not resisting evil as a good thing, because she cannot resist her own evil sadism toward those around her.This is perhaps the first film of this length which I was truly sorry to see end. I was not tired of the characters or the setting. I could not have imagined I would feel this way about a film about winter in Turkey.",

            "content": "Nuri Bilge Ceylan's new film 'Winter Sleep' is a family drama set on a stunning mountain hilltop hotel in Anatolia, Turkey. The ageing Aydin (Haluk Biginer) is the wealthy hotelier, a retired actor who owns a lot of the properties in the area, and spends his days writing for his local newspaper.Aydin is married to the much younger Nihal (Melisa Sozen), and his divorced sister Necla (Demet Akbag) lives on the premises too. Wealthy to the point where he doesn't need to worry about anything, Aydin casually mopes around finding something to do, and generally creating a nuisance of himself. Most people tend to have a reason to dislike him, and this includes his own family. With his wealth extended to his family, these people spend their days doing nothing but still hanker after making a life of purpose.So much time on their hands leads to bitterness, as evidenced in the ongoing bites and petty quarrels between the three of them. Nihal is the curious one, who lives separately from Aydin who gives her the freedom of their modest kingdom. She still feels trapped, blaming Aydin for bringing her down when she's attempting anything of her own making. He's made out to be more monstrous than he seems, slowly being forced out of his own home by everyone.'Winter Sleep' is a contemplative, deeply serious study of wealth, family dynamics and communities. Conversations and arguments are often literate and earnest affairs, discussing anything from the role of the artist, the role of Muslim men in the community, to enabling evil-doers to uncover their own consciences.Aided by the stunning Anatolian rock formations, 'Winter Sleep' is beautifully shot, especially the final images. One majestic scene involving the capture and calming of a horse is a cinematic marvel, and a troubling study of a mans innate desires superceding all others. Although nothing much happens, everything slowly does, as does in life. Even Aydin is forced to change his ways, whether you are rich or poor you still have to earn your happiness.",

            "content": "At over three hours, I was very surprised at the speed which this passed by. This isn't just thanks to the incredible photography and landscapes, but also the dialogue which was consistently intriguing while essentially going nowhere, much like the characters inhabiting the small village.This is a movie without a plot, rather it is a multiple character/relationship study, with some humour littered about as the lead character seems to be one of those people who revels in others' mistakes and enjoys pointing them out, as he is always right. His and his friends interactions with the rest of the cast are somehow captivating, it is action through dialogue. Whether meaningless talk that defines the characters, or more philosophical conversations that bring to mind Russian extensionalist writings, it is the dialogue and the character studies that make up the action. Not a movie for everyone then, I feel I say that a lot but a three-plus hour Turkish film is probably not most folks' cuppa tea. Especially when the conversations get heated \u2013 it's a lot to ask to read all the subtitles and know who is saying what. But the movie paints each character so well that for the most part, I could tell who was saying what through their attitude and manner of speaking.I enjoyed this one immensely, and having never heard of the director Ceylan, I am keen to check out his filmography as soon as possible. Deserving of its Palme d'Or without a doubt, as their isn't a moment where either we see long takes of the incredible cave-like village/hotel and the surrounding areas, all of which look absolutely stunning, or again carefully photographed indoor scenes that again somehow provide for entertaining dialogue despite their being little in the way of narrative. This also rivals Under The Skin, TGBH, Force Majuere and Interstellar for the visual spectacle it provides.I read many comparisons to Bergmann's work, and while this is somewhat true, much like the same comparisons with Force Majuere, they aren't quite accurate. Both study the human condition in its true form: flawed personalities and the results of these. However Bergmann for the most part had one character that was the subject of study, and their flaws were often much more psychologically troubling and dark in atmosphere. This however is a study of an entire village, a metaphor for the various flaws and vices that make up humanity in our society today.One fault that could be aimed at the movie was the running time, as there is no question that in three hours, one would have expected more significant events to occur. I do think that this element should have been explored further, but the simply amazing cinematography, by one G\u00f6khan Tiryaki , and the strangely consistently interesting conversations were by far enough to overlook this. The script was extremely well written, and each conversation revealed more layers of each character's personality. There is no narrative, no plot, but the study of a small community and the secrets and unhappiness that hovers over most living there is quite masterfully done.This is certainly a new experience for me, as I haven't quite seen a movie with such an obvious lack of a narrative, but yet it managed to intrigue, entertain and make me laugh. The ending at first seemed abrupt, but in hindsight it made perfect sense. An ideal ending for an extremely interesting multiple-character study that slowly reveals layers of each character. Some are likable, many aren't, yet their character's gradual progression as people was enough the to satisfy this viewer. It did remind of Bergmann, but in a much less dark and more subtle way. Not to mention this film follows the lives of multiple characters, all whom belong in a hierarchy of sorts, as one owns the hotel, others rent and are subsequently lower, and for the most part are treated as so. A significant event near the end of the movie signifies an actual plot device, and in hindsight I can see why it happened.This is an ambiguous film, it leaves a lot to your imagination, and you're enjoyment of it really depends on the limit of your imagination. If it enjoys sprinting the 100 metre dash in under nine seconds then you will see this film and then want to see it again immediately. If your imagination is slower than a sloth doped up on endone, this perhaps isn't a film for you. But if you use your head, and follow the conversations littered throughout the run-time, you will find yourself intrigued at the many subtleties of the film that are executed with perfection. A good eye is required, and a certain understanding of humanity and personality traits doesn't hurt.Another gem to end the year, 2014 has been filled with amazing movies and the pace does not seem to be letting up. It is extremely encouraging to see not only improved quality from the US, but also many British movies and non-English films that say a lot more than you might think. I feel different cultures approach filmmaking in their own unique way. This is certainly a unique movie, and as it progressed I felt like I was learning simple things about the culture of the characters \u2013 a high number of Muslims, a subject lightly touched on.4.5/5 \u2013 Strong in every facet but narrative/plot, but considering the goals of the movie and what it sets out to do, this absence feels right. It reflects the fates of most of the characters well as a general metaphor for where we are as humans today.",

The key to see 'Winter Sleep' is to be calm and patient. Virtually every scene is stuffed with dialogue and they can endure up to twenty minutes each, which is intellectually drying and makes you feel you can't deal with the next one\u0085but as you waver on to continue to see 'Winter Sleep' or not, the movie has already hooked you on its story again.Aydin it's the central character of 'Winter Sleep' (superbly interpreted by Haluk Bilginer) and he appears in virtually every scene of the movie. Aydin is an intellectual, he's the 'king of his small kingdom', as he himself says, a kingdom constituted by some properties that he rents and his hotel, 'Hotel Othello'. As the people who form his small circle gradually confront him with their opinions about him (first the tenants of one of his properties, then his sister Necla, and finally his wife Nihal), Aydin is forced into a introspection (which constitutes the last act of the movie) concerning him and his relation with his little world. The conclusions Aydin takes from this reflection and how they change his behavior is the ultimate point of 'Winter Sleep'.",

The other credit goes to the carved cave dwellings, some of which date back about a thousand years while others are more recent, of the more recent some are quite elaborately constructed, one of which is the film's setting - a modern caved hotel. Incidentally, the source material for the hills/cliffs is volcanic ash - Tuff (looks like sandstone), a serene natural beauty contrast to the human personalities. Film should have been titled \"Winter Storm\" as a cabin fever style escalation of verbosity, mostly on issues that range from individual/personal values of the film's characters to more abstractly, human values in general, begin to provoke animosities and distrust. The central foil is the hotel owner, Aydin, and because of his appropriately stone like demeanor the diatribes just bounce off of him; even seeming to reflect more of the accusers themselves. I'm inclined to think that a bit more editing would have produced the same film in a little shorter length, but then too we live in a time driven, multitasking environment in contrast to the film's appropriate - time moves glacially slow setting.

I wasn't thoroughly convinced by it (it's too long, almost three hours and fifteen minutes and the characters engage too many times in aimless philosophical discussions), though it has its moments. It is a mostly \"true to life\" film, though being true to life doesn't always makes a movie interesting.The main character is Aydin (Haluk Bilginer) a retired actor who lives in picturesque Cappadocia managing a boutique hotel he has inherited from his father that is seemingly carved in rock. He has also inherited properties in the surrounding area. Aydin sees himself as a sort of the area's enlightened feudal lord, though some of the villagers would beg to argue with the enlightened part, as he is often in violent conflict with those who are late with the rent. Among them is the tough ex-convict Ismail (Nejat Isler), who lives in a dilapidated house with his wife, their son Ilyas (who at the beginning of the movie throws a rock to the car in which Aydin was driving) and his brother Hamdi (Serhat Kilic), the ingratiating, obsequious local imam. Ismail would return towards the end of the film with one of its best scenes, when he pointedly rejects and destroys a valuable present brought by Aydin's wife.In the hotel, Aydin lives mostly with his nagging, recently divorced sister, Necla (Demet Akbag), his tough, capable assistant Hidayet (Ayberk Pekcan) and his younger, beautiful wife Nihal (Melisa Sozen). Aydin and Nihal doesn't seem to be getting along very well, and Nihal tries to enliven her boring life by engaging in charitable work with the area's broken schools, an activity that Aydin mocks. Necla and Nihal criticize Aydin as arrogant and presumptuous. He spend most of the time in the hotel writing a column for the local newspaper (a paper no one reads, according to his sister) and preparing a volume on the history of the Turkish theater (Ceylan might be a bit as presumptuous as Aydin: in the end titles, he quotes Chekhov as a main influence on him).Not much else happens in the movie in terms of plot, as it is mostly about the relationship between the various characters. The characters are recognizably real, though none of them is very likable. Interestingly, there is a clear distinction between the secular outlook of Aydin and his immediate family and the conservative values of the impoverished, religious villagers, all of whose women use the Islamic scarf.I wouldn't recommend this film to a casual film-goer, but those who appreciate difficult, arty films, will probably enjoy this. All the acting in it is phenomenal.",

It is the message of the most powerful scene in the movie. It hits home because of the strong emotions shown by the protagonists, and the totally unexpected turn of events. There are a few such scenes in this movie, but not many. These masterful scenes, full of understated power, are examples of superior film making. There are also many scenes, filled with nothing but long dialogues about philosophical questions. They were much less appealing to me. Slowly but meticulously, the film unravels the character of Aydin, an intellectual who lives in a small village in the Turkish mountains. An inheritance has made him wealthy, he is married to a young and pretty wife, he runs a small hotel and seems to enjoy his simple and quiet life. He is happiest behind his Apple notebook, writing articles about current affairs for a small local newspaper. But in reality Aydin is an unhappy man. He is full of contempt for people with different moral values than his own. He thinks he is superior, 'a king in his own little kingdom', as he puts it. His rigid approach to what is wrong and what is right, leads to a conflict with one of his tenants, who is behind with the rent. Despite Aydin's moral superiority, there are limits to his leniency in this matter. At the same time, he disapproves of the philanthropic activities organized by his wife, which leads to a growing distance between them. The film raises many moral issues. Is justice compatible with compassion? How to deal with financial wealth? Are moral values absolute or relative? Should we resist evil? I could go on. Each viewer will have something to think about after having seen this film. This is no small accomplishment. In fact, one of the most powerful characteristics of good film making is to raise questions, without necessarily providing the answers. It is not hard to see why this film appeals to so many people. Everyone can find something in it from his or her own life. The questions raised are universal, they concern life itself. But a film raising universal questions is not necessarily a masterpiece. It doesn't mean there can be no weak points. I think the overall praise this film has received, is a bit overdone. In my opinion, 'Winter Sleep' tries too hard to be an intellectual challenge. Too many scenes are long, extended conversations. Moreover, they are not contributing to the plot (yes, there is one), but obscuring it. The best films don't spell everything out, but let the images speak for themselves.",

If it hadn't won the Palme De Yawn, you wouldn't find the type of sycophantic reviews currently on display. 'Stunning' 'Emotional' 'Masterful' \u2013 Incredible what people can project so they can feel superior. Let's get down to the bones. Yes there is drama here. About 45 mins worth. That's being generous. It is beautifully shot. The locations are wonderful. The direction is more than competent. There is a certain amount of poetry and/or style involved. No doubting any of that. However, let's get to the heart of the issue. At three hours fifteen, its two hours too long. Snail paced Euro films are great. I love them. Yet the conversations within go into a loop. It's like a bad argument where no one makes new ground yet on it goes, repeating itself. Any self-respecting person would have walked away after assessing the time they were wasting. A good editor could have created something decent out of this. There is interest within the scenes, only because it fools you into thinking that something significant is about to happen. It's a lie. Your life, on a bad day, is much more captivating. It's a shame because the performances are very good. Set within the famous French Film Festival after a couple of joints and a bottle of Cab Sav I'll say this is the best film ever too, at least since the previous year when 'Blue is the Warmest Colour' won, (which was worth its three hours). This simply feels like a director set free without the reins of a producer with balls. Perhaps prior success earned him carte blanche. Perhaps given the turmoil north of its borders, the fact that Turkey produced it made an impact. I hate saying that because I've been to Turkey and they do make great films but political correctness (righteousness) has never been more powerful than now.There's cinematic poetry here, without a doubt, especially given its promising beginning. Real artistry. It mostly occurs in the short outdoor scenes that are edited like a normal, albeit, art film. It's the extended yawn parade indoors that ruins this film. It will be forgotten about in less than a year. In ten years from now, people will be laughing that it received as much acclaim as it did. In fact it will be completely forgotten. Its limpid conclusion will be the metaphor for its ultimate footnote.",

Our protagonist is the salt-and-pepper, middle-aged Aydin (Bilginer), a quondam thespian (a term which he prefers than \"actor\"), who runs a mountaintop hotel called \"Othello\" in Cappadocia of the Central Anatolia. For those who are au fait with Ceylan's track record and artistic felicity, it comes as an invigorating surprise to see a concise-to-wordy volte-face here, as this 196-minutes saga is chiefly composed of long-winded conversation segments (with no embellishment of accompaniments to boot), only intermediately larded with its ongoing actions and the sublime, postcard-ready shots of the magnificent topography of the locale, which is able to rouse even the most torpid wanderlust out of hibernation, Ceylan assures us its natural beauty is unadulterated and the film would land on its feet eventually through its dramaturgic toil. With winter looming around, the hotel business is in its troughs, but Aydin's sedate life is slowly descending into a personal quagmire due to both in-house and extraneous forces. The crisis within is the irreconcilable rift between him and his closest kin, namely his divorced sister Necla (Akbag, coalescing a languid easiness with sharp-edged spite) and his wife Nihal (S\u00f6zan), who is only half of his age. Their first debate is about Necla's \"not resisting evil\" supposition, an airy-fairy notion completely throws oneself on the mercy of other's quarter, before soon it exacerbates into many a personal snide, between Necla and Nihal firstly, then a protracted sibling verbal sparring adding insult to injury, from introspectively dialectical to deliberately catty, Ceylan hits home with his onion-peeling relentlessness to censure a detrimental propensity among intelligentsia: constantly attempting to earn one-upmanship by thinly-veiled denigration. Apparently, Aydin wins this round and Necla willfully takes her bow and never returns thenceforth. The meat of Aydin and Nihal's nuptial rub comes to the fore later, starkly chaste, their relationship has already been on the rocks for years, Nihal tries to ease her \"trophy wife\" shame by plunging into a fund-raising business for schools and children, refusing Aydin's interference of any kind, apart from accepting his anonymous charity from time to time. She cannot bear his non- threatening but chronically encroaching superciliousness, yet has no moxie to put the kibosh on their marriage in gridlock. As for Aydin, he sees all too well of Nihal's fix and cunningly barters his subservience for her entrapment \"I love you, and I know you don't love me, but you cannot get your cake and eat it too!\", that is the connotation. The cruel manifestation of selfish love from those who are endowed with clout and money. And later in a conversation with a local teacher Levent (Saribacak, exemplifies cogently how to shoot the booze-emboldened sideswipes), which goes argumentative, Aydin seemingly has the final say with a caustic rejoinder but the subsequent spewing betrays that an inward damage is done.Outwardly, it is the gap between castes that writs large and cannot be mediated, the family of Aydin's hard-up tenants, brothers Hamdi (Kili\u00e7) and Ismail (Isler) cannot pay their rent on time and the ensuing dispute becomes rather ugly, and when a broken car window impels Hamdi to humble himself in front of a condescending Aydin, the Janus-faced reality seeps into the scenario in both castes, from smile to curse, from bonhomie to grumbling, all in a trice, even Aydin's chauffeur/assistant Hidayet (Pekcan), who is not above to hector those less fortunate tenants, but meanwhile has to carry all his master's luggage in a snowfall day, with the latter wandering with idle hands, so it is not surprising to see him one minute ago promise to keep a secret at the behest of Aydin and the next minute, casually divulges it to another party on the phone, the well-adjusted equilibrium between obedience and defiance is all too close to home.Indubitably, WINTER SLEEP is first and foremost, an actor's showpiece, leading actor Haluk Bilginer competently hammers out his delivery on the strength of his word-wielding expertise and telegraphs Aydin's inscrutable train of thought when lines are not proffered. Melisa S\u00f6zen, on the other hand, brilliantly portrays a more emotionally readable persona and her best scenes are in the cathartic episode, when Nihal tries to use money to buy her conscience in front of a seething Nejat Isler (emotive with a commensurate restraint, upstaging the rest in his two scenes), and the story reaches its apogee, but in post-mortem, it is a missing opportunity that Ceylon doesn't apply his \"not resisting evil\" theory for a trial run here, which in return points up Ceylon's own guarded and idealized stance of the have-nots: they are willing to die for dignity, the only remnant left for them to weaponize. An illuminating stew of the perennial vagaries (religion, philosophy, morality and class stratification, etc.) obstructing our day-to-day communications, WINTER SLEEP mark's Ceylon's highest achievement so far for his profound perspective in fleshing out a conundrum that is elementally complex and sophisticatedly widespread.",

He likes to pontificate on local events in his column for the local newspaper but the reality is much more mundane.I liked the scene where he realises his wife has disconnected from his world view and he pretends to go off on one of his business trips to the city. In reality he heads off to a neighbour's farm where he drinks with his buddy and the local school teacher who inadvertently lets slip a few home truths.Despite all of this it is a great movie- head and shoulders above almost anything else being made today. if they cut a few of the longer speeches out it would be a better movie but still great.",

Numerous tea-drinking, dialogue-limited, superfluous scenes where nothing of value occurs- there is no plot but it overflows with complex themes and psychological intensity (My two favorite questions: Can you force someone into an inevitability of remorse by not resisting their evil? and \n\"Conscience\", \"Morals\", \"Principles\", \"Purpose\"; The one who uses these words the most is perhaps the most highly suspect?) \n \nAggressive, drawn-out discussions between brother and sister; passive-aggressive arguments between husband and wife; circuitous conversations between landlord and tenant; all create an impressively tangible and physical tenseness in the viewer- yet the characters meet with very little resolution. The ending is many things at once: devastating, difficult to understand, even more difficult to accept, and leaves one with much to ponder (That much money, wasted! How can one's pride be worth that much?) Ostensibly about a retired actor who now owns a hotel and multiple properties in meagerly populated Cappadocia, spending most of his time researching and writing, Loneliness, morality, religion, philosophy, family, marriage, philanthropy, pride, parenthood, social consciousness, the disparity between classes, though- these are the real characters. Incredible cinematography- especially some of the scenery shots in the dead of winter (My favorite is the releasing of the horse into the wild on a winter night.) Although needlessly lengthy, manages to allure with a beautiful shot or profound dialogue as boredom begins to set in. \n---- \nAcrostic is a form of poetry where the first letters in each line, paragraph, or word are doubly used to spell a name, phrase, or word.

In a week in which the Turkish PM can tell the world \"Equality between men and women is against nature\", you hope that this film will go some ways towards disproving this stupid statement. It doesn't, though I think it could and should have.Some films are made to elucidate ideas, others to put ideas out there and let the viewer decide what to make of them. I left the cinema unsure which of these two kinds of thoughtful film the director was trying to make. Are we supposed to deplore the actions of the landlord getting to grips with a tenant who is way behind in the rent? If so, why? I felt I was being deceived by an attempt to pretend the viewer could come up with his/her own ideas about the supposed iniquity of the rich lording it over the poor, while in fact the film was busy pounding away telling me what to think.There is much to admire in this beautifully shot and acted film. I didn't mind the length of it, but it will test some. What's not to admire is all too obvious:a) many very lengthy and wordy existential conversations - even art films work best if this is kept to a minimumb) animal cruelty - there is simply no excuse for it these days c) the ending.There will be those who think this ending is deliberately left open and thus up to our imagination. I disagree. We are being deceptively fed the possibility of the wife's freedom from the past when in fact it's quite apparent what will happen given the way the plot line evolves concerning the money and what happens to women who leave their husbands (the sister says it all - a magnificent performance by the way). I don't see how this shows women to be anything less than commodities and beings to be protected in this culture. Of course, you might say. That's the point. Well, if that's the point, the filmmaker is doing very little to alter this situation. Men's bastardry is one thing, but when the plot itself conspires with the husband to condemn the wife, it's another. That is unforgivable.",

I did not mind (in fact the last hour is the one that felt the shortest) but I really sensed that the director could have conveyed the same message in a two hours movie. I suppose he preferred to add extra time in every scene to make it feel more like a real life situation. And he succeeded. He also mastered the visual side of cinema with some impressive photography. Some shots were absolute eye candy!On a more personal note, I would say this doesn't fit entirely in the \"My favourite movies\" category, but rather in the \"movies I can enjoy\".

The free-spirited motorcyclist man symbolized to me that unlimited freedom was also a state of alienation like dogmatic conservatism. The only scene that I didn't think realistic was Nihal's confrontation when the money she gives as a gift is turned into ashes by the unpredictable man, Ismail.

            "content": "Winter Sleep (2014) :\nBrief Review -Turkish Cinema's attempt to make Ingmar Bergman Cinema is trapped in Overlong Narrative and Over-Intellectualism. When i saw Bergman films i thought this man made a big fuss out of small small issue of life but some of films really impressed me. Most of the films sounded strange and impactless because of compassionate themes, regression analysis and sort of stuff. I personally never cared much about such stuff unless the characters were truly supportive and positively portrayed according to the concept. Winter Sleep is similar to what Bergman tried years ago in modern style. The film is about a former actor, now writer and a rich man Aydin, his wife Nihal who is much younger than him, his divorved sister Necla and little bit about a poor family living as tenants in Aydin's property. It depicts the tension between husband and wife whose relationship is soulless (god knows why are they still living together), brother and sister whose thinking are on opposition directions, and between landlord and tenants at some level. The narrative is 196 minutes long for no reason because it does not come to any conclusion. The main reason is non-cinematic vision which makes the dramatic values disappear at first place. The other reason is, a narrative trying to be too intellectual becomes dumb and non semse because overuse of intellectual thoughts always end up as fisco even in real life. One can never understand the intellectual and provoking theory shown in the main characters because one cannot live life like this. Like i said, the husband and wife having no bond, no feelings at all are still together for no reason, why? The sister is over realistic and she doesn't do a thing and then herself scream about feeling bored, really? The wealthy man having enough brain of his own asks these low IQ people for help? Seriously? Don't know what kind of sense these characters made to some audience and that too when it comes without any concrete conclusion. Now, coming to the pluses, the first one is of course dialogues writing. It has some real high score dialogues that might be relevant to some people and might even change their thinking. The second biggest plus point is natural acting of the cast. Third and the last is directorial efforts took by the director to bring conviction in this inconclusive storyline. Overall, a fine attempt i repeat, 'a fine attempt' (not a fine film) to show the innermost complications of people's lives. The last thing i wanna ask is, what the hell is this film doing in IMDb Top Rated list? There are many cult films which should have replaced it long ago.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "content": "Winter Sleep is a great movie on different levels. Unlike his previous film, Once Upon a Time in Anatolia, Ceylan's use of poetic language is spare and not central to his new film. Instead, the focus has shifted to character studies through Bergmanesque scathingly revealing dialogues that makes the similarity of the title to the film Winter Light maybe not entirely coincidental.But what makes the film unique is how it works well as a psychodrama but it doesn't confine itself to the inner lives and struggles of its characters. On a different level, the characters can rightly be coming out of a Dostoevsky story, each representing an archetype, the wealthy (the bored and jaded, the sensitive and empathic but trapped in a bubble of luxury, the distant and arrogant pseudo-intellectual taking his moral and cultural upper hand for granted) and the poor (the subservient, the frustrated and hateful, the resigned and meek.) Ceylan's keen observation on how the poor and the wealthy, each destined to live in their own bubbles, see themselves and fail to understand the other makes their inevitable clash, as the hunting scene might suggest, more like a law of nature than due to their personal demons and character weaknesses. Maybe some of the arguments in the film can be read in the same Dostoevskian vein: the artists putting words into his characters' mouths to argue and counter-argue what he himself has been grappling with. But even during those conversations, the undercurrent of psychological drama is present; the question is not just what they are arguing or whether we agree or not but what motivates them to say what they say. What feels a bit thematically out of place from the rest of film though, is when Ceylan becomes Dostoevskian in a melodramatic way in a scene where Ismael refuses to accept the money from Nihal. And aside from a few scenes where it feels the movie is losing its steam in this more than three hours of a marathon, Winter Sleep is a considerable achievement and one of the best movies of the year.",

            "content": "This is an interesting but not captivating movie, at least not if you're a Turk for whom Nuri Bilge's stories are a tad too mundane and his settings a tad too touristic. On the other hand what's not to like about a Palme d'Or film when Turks have so little to be proud of these days? Still, Nuri Bilge never fails to irritate me with his settings out of Turkey travel brochures and this is no exception. That's the main reason why I call this film a \"kilim.\" A kilim is a poor man's Turkish carpet that tourists love but Turks look down on. When a filmmaker fills his work with tourist-trap \"local color\" we say in Turkey that he has made a kilim, not a film. However Nuri Bilge has made far tackier kilims; this is certainly his best one.The setting is the more obvious kilim feature, whereas the tiny figures barely moving on its chilly whiteness are what is supposed to be the mystery that binds the viewer. These weird Chekovian characters on the fringes of life, hibernating in that ancient land of outcasts and refugees that is Cappadocia, are no doubt intriguing for foreigners but for Turks they are the people next door. If not for all Turks, at least for the circle of urban pseudointellectuals among whom Nuri Bilge used to cruise before he started jet-setting big time.The menagerie of characters that he displays in this tourist-trap landscape are what make this kilim's patterns more subtle than the usual Nuri Bilge wares. But like any kilim, they are far more interesting for foreigners than to Turks. That's why for a Turk, watching this kilim is like sitting in front of the window. If you do that for 2.5 hours, you can't be blamed for dozing off every now and then, as I did.",

            "review_title": "Winter Sleep with Dreams",
            "content": "Warning: This account has potentially very serious spoilers. Please do not read unless you have seen the movie.I watched Nuri Bilge Ceylan's Winter Sleep this week, twice actually. It was a wonderful, deep, multifaceted movie. There is much I could say about the movie, the rich plot, and the wonderful director (and, with his equally talented wife Ebru Ceylan, screenwriter). So much of it has been said here and elsewhere that I don't need to repeat it. However, I think the story is far richer than even most commentators seem to acknowledge (perhaps they are more circumspect than I). Instead, I will give a very short summary, and then discuss what I think is one of the, if not the, most important parts of the film (and which constitutes a spoiler \u2013 this is your second warning). I will generalize somewhat, to partially protect, despite my warning above, readers who have not yet experienced this masterpiece.The film is very closely based on Chekhov's short stories \"The Wife\" and \"Excellent People,\" with some dialogue being verbatim. As many have pointed out, \"Winter Sleep\" is a story of how Aydin, a self-deceived man becomes a more self-aware man, although whether his fundamental isolation has changed is ambiguous. At the beginning of the movie, his world is literally rocked. From there, he begins a long and highly ambiguous progression. His beautiful wife Nihal, however, is enigmatic, bored, and isolated in several ways from her husband. She leads, however, a charitable effort to improve impoverished schools in the area. Is it truly altruistic? We see later in the film how her charity seems to be very narrowly focused, and might benefit another character in particular, and herself vicariously.Most fascinating are the tangled webs of relationships in the movie, both acknowledged and unacknowledged. Aydin seems at times to be suspicious of his best friends or distant acquaintances, including one older friend whose complete role we may never understand. Meanwhile, Nihal has even more complicated, even deeply secretive relationships.What sort of secrets? Nihal appears to have an unspoken bond with Ilyas, a poor boy. In an interview with the Guardian (November 13, 2014), Ceylan says that he was inspired by some of Chekhov's short stories, and one in particular, but is reluctant to say which, for fear the film should be seen as an adaptation. \"I don't want to talk about it,\" he says. \"It was a starting point. There was a little dialogue, but mainly description. You cannot say there was a story but there was a sense of life there.\" As both \"The Wife\" and \"Excellent People\" are dialogue-heavy, and Ceylan has acknowledged his indebtedness to at least \"The Wife,\" it appears that he is speaking of a third story. The interviewer, however, does not seem to acknowledge that. I think that one relationship is key to understanding the movie, and it appears based on a not-quite-halfway-through part of Chekhov's story \"Dreams\" (*big* spoiler alert there). \"Dreams\" includes much speech, but it is more like a monologue. Transferring a description of a familial relationship described there to the film requires some reversals of roles, but the absolutely critical personal decision about class and choice remains the same. (Intriguingly, \"Dreams\" also includes a dog as a touchstone, and barking dogs are one of the curious motifs of the film, extending even after the final fade).To me, this deeply complicated relationship explains so much of the movie, from the launching of a projectile at its beginning to actions (and silences) later. Nihal has a sharp, visceral, almost unexpected reaction at a key point, which is explained by this bond, as are key actions at the end of the film. Even without the \"Dreams\" connection, the relationship seems clear.Viewers may disagree. It deepens the film's moral ambiguity. Some may object on chronological grounds, but Nihal's youth seems to admit of several possibilities (although one seems most plausible). Perhaps the most critical piece of seemingly contradictory information occurs when Nihal seems to mistake the ages of two other characters (earlier, Aydin does this). However, her body language and the pauses seems to me to indicate a serious attempt at deception, rather than genuine ignorance on her part. Particularly important glances between Nihal and Ilyas are also exchanged at various times during the movie, seeming to acknowledge what goes unacknowledged. What remains silent in this movie is often as profound as what is spoken.In just one example, a dialogue occurs early on where Aydin's sister reproaches herself and says that if she had remained with a troubled individual, that person might not have sunken to their currently low state. Nihal, like all of us would, assures her that that is not true and that she should not be taking the blame. (There is also a veiled reference to a \"truth\" that was spoken years previously \u2013 undoubtedly important but never explained). Later we see, however, that the dilemma over what action should have been taken in the past extends to the her life too - that a third, troubled character could conceivably be a better person if relationships had turned out differently (and yet another might have been benefited too). This interpretation regarding \"Dreams\" makes this early dialogue, which otherwise raises some \"why is this in the movie\" questions, even more rich and meaningful. At the end of the movie, it is Nihal who realizes that the assumptions (and self-deception?) under which she has been living have been irrevocably changed. An open question remains how many characters are aware of this secretive relationship - I would argue at least two, based on the pregnant glances. That may also explain the violent, if futile gesture at the beginning of the movie.Because of this movie's deeply involved, moving plot, wonderful acting, and unexpected richness, this is one of the most profound and best movies I have ever seen.",

            "review_title": "Well-made, but far too long",
            "content": "I have nothing against the idea of making a film that goes for three or more hours. In fact, I've thoroughly enjoyed many movies that are as long or even longer than Winter Sleep. BUT: I've always felt as though a filmmaker needs a really strong reason to make something that demands this much time from its audience.Something like Magnolia (1999) justifies its running time by featuring many different characters with their own (sometimes interlinking) stories. A film like Once Upon a Time in America (1984) tells an intensely personal story over a number of decades, using its length to explore interesting themes regarding friendship, growing up, and getting old. Then there are the old-fashioned epics like Ben-Hur (1959) or Gone With The Wind (1939 ) that tell gigantic, larger than life stories over a number of hours.Winter Sleep, however, does not justify its length in the same way, in my opinion. Not only could 60-90 minutes be quite easily trimmed off its running time, I feel as though doing so would actually make the film a better experience. Here we have a story about a landlord who struggles with some of his tenants whilst having marital problems with his much younger wife. The film does not span a great deal of time. There are not too many characters or subplots. There is not an earth-shattering pay-off to the proceedings (although the ending isn't bad, by any means).And yes, the acting and cinematography and all the technical aspects are strong, and yes I'm harping on about length, but I feel as though it was really the only roadblock that prevented me from engaging with the film more. I get the sense that most viewers do not feel this way, and this could be on me, as someone who needs to work on strengthening their attention span. Just my two cents, however; something I had to get off my chest I guess.",

            "content": "There would seem to be something inherently uncinematic about the chamber drama: a work tied to one, domestic space and the conversations that ensue therein. With Winter Sleep, rightly celebrated Turkish auteur Nuri Bilge Ceylan proves, like Bergman before him, that the chamber drama can indeed be high cinema. While most of the scenes take place in interiors, in only a few different rooms, Ceylan and DP Gokhan Tiryaki create brilliant master- shots in which the characters converse. There are a handful of exteriors of the Anatolian steppe and they are, characteristic of Ceylan, exceptionally beautiful. Interior or exterior, the color palate of the film is beyond reproach- consisting, as the title suggests, almost entirely of winter hues.One of the themes that, it seems to me, connects Celyan's films is the gradations of power, sometimes brutally absolute power, that people wield over others in contemporary Turkish society. In the director's \"Three Monkeys\" modern Turkey was portrayed as an almost feudalistic society, except that capitalism had enabled different layers of classes, and thus different layers of serfdom. The bourgeois suffer for the infractions of the wealthy, and the poor suffer for those of the bourgeois. In \"Winter Sleep\" the power dynamics are more emotional than economic, though the latter still comes into play. Indeed, as much as this film consists of interactions between family members in private spaces, it may subtly be Ceylan's most socio-political statement. The characters are former Istanbulite \"cultural elites\" holed up in the majestic if impoverished Turkish steppe, most focally Aydin, a former actor and son of a local land lord who has uncomfortably inherited his dad's power, as well as the coldly beautiful ancestral home that he has converted into a picturesque hotel. Aydin tries to shield himself from moral responsibility for the misery imposed on his destitute tenants, a struggle for which his wife Nihal tries and fails to assume responsibility. Aydin consistently tries to blind himself from his real affect on the world by commenting on society in a weekly newspaper column in which he tries to come off as bearing properly Turkish sensibilities- promoting a fine line between \"modern thinking\" and religious propriety, even though he has no use for religion, is of Europeanized taste, and seems more comfortable chatting with his foreign guests in English than relating to the local people, or indeed, his family. The most consistent theme in the interactions between Aydin, his wife, and sister Necla is whether turning the other cheek will lead one's tormentor to see the wrong of their ways. These characters do, indeed, seem to employ this technique in their interactions. Nihal, for instance, accuses Aydin of causing her misery. Aydin asserts that he is a \"modern husband\" and that she is \"free to go as she pleases\", though reminds Nihal that she will be impoverished if she divorces him. He then offers to give her space by rejoining society- Istanbul, hoping that she will feel guilty for hurting his feelings and ask him to stay. This passive-aggressive give-and-take is repeated in superficially different ways throughout the film between different sets of the three relatives. On the verge of leaving for Istanbul for the winter to give Nihal and Necla some space, Aydin instead goes on a drunken hunting trip with an old friend and returns to the hotel, bearing a slain rabbit as an offering to his family. The only internal dialog in the film is its last lines, in which Aydin acknowledges to himself, though not to his family, his terror of the thought of being without them even though he knows they no longer love him. The family thus remains stranded together in the isolated, beautiful ruin of their ancestral home, Ceylan's metaphor for contemporary Turkish society. Consistently hoping the other will implicate themselves for the misery around them, the characters emotionally oppress one another by telling each other that their unhappiness is their own doing since they are all, after all, free to do as they please in the modern state of Turkey. The \"freedom\" of a supposed modernity is thus the medium by which society's subjects incriminate one another. While Ceylan's film is most specifically an allegory of modern Turkey, it could serve as commentary on the oppressive freedom of \"liberal democracies\" everywhere.",

Schubert's harmony with each scene, acting, character development and cinematography were excellent. But after a while, Ceylan started to drown the movie in unnecessary dialogues. For example, the scene of the man and his sister arguing, the discussion, whose conclusion is obvious, is prolonged with such unnecessary dialogues that the audience begins to break away from the film. I've seen too many unnecessary scenes, dialogues like this. All in all, I liked the movie, but I don't think the score it deserves above 7. Some dialogs where exhausting (& no, I am not referring to the subs reading) they where far too long and went in a circleto to a point where it comes across as pretentious (maybe purposely).

Kis Uyukusu reportedly and adaptation of a short story by Chevkov (The Wife) which I never read, with one of the subplots of Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov, which I don't remember, thrown in, tells the story of Aydin (Haluk Bilginer, too close for comfort) a well-off former actor, landlord and hotel owner in Cappadocia, who procrastinates through life in the midst of unfulfilled plans and good intentions, which pave a well-known path, illustrated by his dealings with his frustrated bored younger wife's (Melissa S\u00f6zen) attempts at charity, his bored bitter divorced sister's (Demet Atbag) sharp tongue, a family of indebted poor tenants comprised of a young boy (Emirhan Doruktutan) who throws a stone at Aydin\u00b4s car, breaking a glass window and setting the film\u00b4s plot in motion, his ex-con angry father (Nehat Isler), the Imam brother of same's (Serhat Kili\u00e7, just as impressive as Haluk Bilginer) attempts to patch things up, the release of a wild horse - arguably the only good deed in the film to go unpunished - and the burning of an envelope full of 100 Turkish Lira bills, to name but a few.Ceylan is the only director I know who can film prosaic morceaux de vie and lengthy dialogue scenes with an elegiac sense of fable. To paraphrase WWI veterans description of war as long periods of tedium interspersed by occasional moments of terror, in Kis Uyukusu life is portrayed as much ado about nothing interspersed with moments of bemused regret.Philip Larkin once wrote: \"all we have done not mattering\".

He is indifferent to the many who are less well-off than he. The film centres around his desires to write while dealing with crumbling relations with his much younger wife (Melisa Sozen) and his divorced sister (Demet Akgag) who lives with them (the inn was inherited as a family property).At over three hours with no intermission, this film demands a lot from its audience especially as it is mostly dialogue. Luckily, director/co-writer (with Ebru Ceylan) Nuri Bilge Ceylan makes the best of this fine cast to make the long journey worthwhile.There are three two-way conversations among the three main characters which are long and all of them reveal the depth and sadness of many human relationships.There is also a subplot involving a poor extended family who are among Aydin's tenants. The storyline was the crux of the film's beginning but suddenly disappears until an heartbreaking encounter near the end.Some reviewers have rightly compared this film to the better works of Ingmar Bergman. Bilginer, Sozen, and Akgag all do a great job in keeping the audience engaged especially during their long dialogue scenes.

            "content": "Wow! This is the first film of Mr. Ceylan's that I have watched & boy am I impressed! The deep insight that he has into the nature of relationships reminded me of Ingmar Bergman. And I don't say it lightly because to me Bergman is the God of cinema.The aging thespian-turned-hotelowner, his young wife & his divorced sister are not getting along well and the tension in the household is palpable, but unavoidable. The hotelowner feels like a wise ruler of his little realm who is kind to all around him but apparently he is conceited in that notion since almost everyone seems to resent him. He, on the other hand, feels that those around him who benefit from his generosity are ungrateful. In one scene, when challenged, he quotes Shakespeare with \"Our infallible fate is to be deceived in everything we attempt. I make brilliant plans in the morning, then fool around all day.\" His young wife is naive, idealistic & somewhat inert. Never having had any opportunity to do something meaningful in her life, she feels that her husband is robbing her of her youth & purpose. The divorced sister is a well-meaning but lost and unhappy woman. Although she has come out of a terrible marriage, she still feels that she should have done more to save her marriage. So acute is her sense of failure that she can't even conceive of undertaking any other endeavor that could give meaning to her life.Even though the film is observing rich & spoilt people (who have never personally experienced common man's troubles), claiming boredom & personal crises, it still resonates with everyone. This is probably because ironically, the under-privileged class has the things that people with all the privileges crave. His henchman obviously confides in & enjoys a happy relationship with his wife Fatma, the housemaid. The fresh-out-of-jail tenant, Ismail, has the loyalty & respect of his son. The teacher has the satisfaction of providing education to under-privileged kids & also being able to financially support his family back home. The Imam, with all his greasy mannerisms, is still very devoted to his family.Honestly, a more than 3 hour film is not my idea of a good film, but this one made me wish for a longer runtime! The best work of art is one that makes the beholders look within themselves & introspect. And this movie did precisely that; held a mirror in front of me & made me see my own flaws! Hopefully, I should be able to learn from this wonderful experience & make some improvements!",

Haluk Bilginer and Melisa Sozen are highly compelling and their performances help compensate for the long runtime.Still, 200 minutes is a long time for anything and the film becomes arduous in places. My other gripe with Winter Sleep is that some of the onscreen dialogue feels more like the writer's internal psychobabble being vomited onto the screen (much like a Woody Allen movie) rather than authentic conversation.Nevertheless, despite the typical art house drawbacks, Winter Sleep is very absorbing for such a long film.",

As I stated before, the character of Aydin (even while instructing others that the road to hell is paved with good intentions) likes to justify himself with his good intentions and doesn't want to mislead people: he defers the tenant to his partner about the debt, he's always reading his articles on potentially touchy issues to his sister for feedback, and even little things like the way he expresses uncertainty to the client about the Omar Sharif movie that was filmed in the area and how he examines the pictures on his website after the client asks about the horses at the hotel (the horse being captured and subsequently set free was also a nice touch of symbolism).",

            "content": "Winner of the Palme D'or in 2014, Turkish Director Nuri Bilge Ceylan's Winter's Sleep succeeds on many levels as a cinematic achievement. Just as other movies in his oeuvre, Ceylan again takes a simple story, and combines it with an exquisite cinematography, well-drawn characters, crackling dialogue, stimulating use of image and sound and a well-balanced black humor. The result: a brilliant piece of cinema in every aspect.While the film's central theme seems revolving around never-ending tirades and mind games between protagonist and the people in his surroundings (his family, friends and his tenants), actually the film focuses on a man's internal struggle, an array of moral dilemmas, a clash between value systems, a complex tapestry of relationships, and matters of faith, empathy and feeling. Also, the humdrum of remote small-town life in the darkest time of winter is exquisitely reflected. Just like his previous works, Ceylan opts again to keep the running time to a considerable length in order to bring a novelistic effect to his simple yet thought-provoking story. It lasts more than 3 hours and has a slow, measured pace, but no single moment or line feels extraneous. It never drags or gets boring. Definitely, he is a story-teller in the true sense.Similar to his former movies (such as \"Climates\", \"Distant\" and \"Once upon a Time in Anatolia\") , Ceylan again takes advantage of his background as a photographer. The picture is gorgeous from the first scene to the last, thanks to the wintry Cappadoccian setting. He creates an out-of-this-world mood, mesmeric and melancholic, suggesting that his characters are somehow cut off from the realities of the world. The attention to authentic details is impeccable. The hotel, that cut directly into rock, serves as a perfect ground for movie's gloomy atmosphere. Beautifully lit cave- like chambers, with crackling log fires in the background provide an excellent place for expansively conceived, circular debates.Likewise, all characters are well-drawn and well-cast. Incomprehension of another's feelings, and intellectual and emotional dissimilarities of characters are exquisitely portrayed, and reflected into ponderously long, but sharp and crackling dialogue. From cynical, selfish and privileged Ayd\u0131n (Haluk Bilginer) to fragile, oppressed and embattled wife Nihal (Melisa S\u00f6zen), and to confused, depressed and resentful sister Nermin (Demet Akba\u011f), all characters are trapped in their cocoons of emotional loneliness and insipid existences.G\u00f6khan Tiryaki's cinematography is outstanding in the use of lights, shadows and dark contrasts that enhance the story to such an extent. Majority of scenes starts with a long shot in long take with static cameras. Indoor scenes are inter-cut with powerful close-ups, all with the flavor of artsy photography; with reverse, changing camera angles and pans and tilts. Sharpness and colors are glorious too.Last word: Pure, plain and gripping, one of the best films of 2014. This is a kind of movie that makes you think over and over again about the distances inherent to human relationships. (8.4/10)",

What added on to the feeling that this movie was way too long was the fact that some conversations were not as intriguing or revealing as the director or playwright thought they would be. The amount of bickering was in excess, and it was trying the audience's concentration and patience. This could have been handled better; the interpersonal affray could be sharper, the digging up of old feuds, the dirt dishing, the flinging of family skeletons all felt lukewarm. There is, of course, no lack of dramatic irony; this was well appreciated at times, even if it was an age-old clich\u00e9 to have a husband pretending to leave town in the hope of catching his wife unawares. The screaming hypocrisy of the middle class and the bourgeois embodied by the chief protagonist was well played. He lived contentedly in his snug little comfort zone in self-deceit, oblivious to the world around him and the needs of others, fussing over trivial matters and oozing with self-importance over his petty articles, believing himself to be a pillar of spiritual and literary influence he hardly was (as pointed out by his sister). The ever widening rift between the social classes mocked the charity work by Nihal to the poor, for her it was a hobby, something to channel her energy and efforts into to dissipate her boredom to be married to a rich old man whom she did not love. Thus her utter dismay and disbelief to have her well-intended charity backlash with such fury (tossing stacked cash into the fireplace to spite must feel powerful), yet she had never envisaged that her kind gesture was an insult humiliating honest poor folks who were used to earning their keep. The film also dripped heavily with symbolism - I imagine the horse representing ideals, dreams and freedom, though what the rabbit meant was unclear to me. For those who love astounding visuals, this movie would not disappoint. The breaking in of the steed was a stunning scene though some might find it uncomfortable. The Turkish landscape is presented in a poetic and artistic portrayal with many breathtaking sights. One could not but be mesmerized by the snow-capped mountains and the mist veiling the ridges and the valleys. The picturesque quaint old buildings and the majestic ancient architecture made this movie almost an unofficial tourism bureau advertisement. In the end, the chief protagonist appeared to have found a new meaning in life - at least he did begin to write his book. His beautiful pretentious wife learnt a lesson (hopefully) and where do we find ourselves? Exactly where we began? An interesting end to a supposedly insightful introspective journey. It was worth mentioning that in Hong Kong, the movie was translated into \"winter awakening\", which might be a more apt title. Last but not least, good acting on the part of most actors and actresses who managed to carry the story across (in spite of the script and the dialogue at times) convincingly and realistically.",

Sometimes though I wish they were spelled out.It is about the ability of mankind to withdraw from life, in order to survive the cold winter. There is a central scene between brother and sister, in which they dispute on the surface, but in fact they reveal layer for layer the excuses, they made for living their lives.However, and thats the main critic point, the movie moved me intellectually but not emotionally. The difference between a good movie and a great movie is: the good movie shows the problem, it requires intelligence, the great movie shows a way out, it requires courage. This one is \"only\" a good movie.The final scene remains a mystery to me: Is it meant as a happy or bad ending? Does it mean he begins, what he didn't dare to begin earlier, or does it mean he remains in his winter sleep. The closing pictures suggest the latter. It would make a great movie out of \"Winter sleep\".",

            "content": "Trying to explain winter sleep is a really hard thing. Like his other movies, this movie also takes you inside till the end. You have to think while you are watching all scenes it is not an action or commercial movie this is a piece of art. There is no doubt to Ceylan has won the prize for his movie and I am very proud of him as a Turkish man. After the success of Yilmaz Guney's movie 'Yol' Winter Sleep was the second feature movie that has won best picture golden palm from Cannes Movie Festival and iconically both of them have given the same pose after their speech at festival.If I summarize the theme. Our characters live together in a rural place together. Aydin, his wife Nihal and his sister Necla. They have a hotel in Cappadocia that is a very touristic place in Nevsehir,Turkey. In winter they live together there and stay too much together in the same place enough to come into conflict with each other. So to say, we can see confession full of angry, hate and fear. Aydin and Necla mostly discuss their ideas about life, religion and their situation. In the beginning, two of them are calm and provide useful view to each other but after a while they start to blame and throw up hate each other. They are very good at seeing the deficiencies of others but ignorant in recognizing themselves. When we look at Aydin and his wife, actually, they don't have a nice marriage that they don't stay together. They are clear-headed people so they married each other fondly, however, after they get to know one another they start to be away from each other. In one scene, Nihal shares her real and open ideas about his husband. She mentions him as a selfish person who wants to control everything and everyone around him. Then, her husband says that his wife is unfair to him and he is working to keep their marriage well.During this whole things, we can clearly see the rural place of Turkey and ideas about many situations about life. Ceylan has affected and inspired by writers like Dostoevsky, Tolstoy and Chekhov. There is also another subject that is covered in movie. Aydin and the people around him like Nihal and Necla represent 'Upper Class' and try to define intellectual person and at the same time we see representatives of the lower class like Aydin's assistant and clergyman in the village with his family. As a consequence of this we have a chance to contrast and compare different people from different backgrounds. I can obviously say that every detail has covered in this movie too much care.Lastly, I want to mention my two favorite scenes. The Money scene and final scene. I won't give too many details in Money scene Aydin's wife Nihal wanted to help to poor family that live in village for they have a better life condition but a man does not accept this and throw the money to fire. In final scene we hear a letter from Aydin's mouth to his wife and it was very impressive and emotional. Please go and watch this amazing movie.",

            "content": "The most interesting of the many long and interesting conversations in Winter Sleep is initiated by Necla, Aydin's sister, when she proposes the idea that 'evil should not be resisted'.\u00a0 What if, she argues, that by not resisting those who intend to do us harm they might lose the desire or need to hurt. \u00a0 It is in on the face of it, of course,\u00a0 a ridiculous idea.\u00a0 The confident, cultured, articulate Aydin cannot be bothered to even consider it. He immediately jumps to the unassailable example of Hitler and the Jews.\u00a0 That's the result when you don't resist evil.\u00a0And of course it is when the threat is to a\u00a0people, a nation, perhaps even\u00a0a planet or some fundamental ideal. But even\u00a0this is terribly slippery territory;\u00a0the determination of evil is not an absolute and always depends on what or who is defined as evil, and by what or whom it is defined.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 But in jumping immediately to the macro, Aydin is avoiding his own case. What about here, much closer to home, in fact his home in which they are in sitting, the home where Aydin practices his own form of evil against those he sees as some kind of threat \u2014-what he perceives as evils that must be resisted.\u00a0The setting is after all, the Hotel Othello and is not Aydin a sort Othello\u00a0himself?\u00a0 It is not a perfect comparison but consider\u0085. the young and beautiful bride who began by \"idolizing\" him; the Iago within\u00a0who whispers against her.\u00a0 Aydin's Iago is not an outside enemy but himself. As Nihal says to Aydin when he\u00a0 disingenuously asks what he should feel guilty for, \"you are an honest, fair and conscientious man but you use\u00a0these virtues to suffocate, to crush and humiliate people.\"\u00a0That\u00a0is exactly what he has done to her. Aydin has seen her attempt to make a meaningful life for herself as a threat against him.\u00a0 Her growth and independence is some form of evil done to him that he has to resist.\u00a0\u00a0He has reduced her work to improve the education opportunities for the local village children\u00a0to an 'interest'.\u00a0 Nihal 'cares about these things' he says to a visiting neighbour when he commands her to join them to ostensibly consider a charitable request he has received from a local young woman.\u00a0In fact, he cares nothing about philanthropy;\u00a0 the former actor has seated his audience to witness a sort of\u00a0one-man show as he reads out the petitioner's flattering admiration for him and the weekly column he writes for the local newspaper.\u00a0When Nihal's work finally comes to fruition with a meeting of a new funding council (which, significantly, includes the same neighbour) Aydin dismisses them all and particularly her as hopelessly naive . As it turns out she is foolishly generous, but that is for her to find out not for him to pre- determine. For now, Aydin demeans Nihal by offering to 'check' her books. As she tries to describe how diminished she feels by his lack of respect,\u00a0 he smiles with patronizing superiority, clearly dismissing her philanthropic work as some childlike attempt at pointless self-determination.\u00a0But Nihal finally takes the path her sister in law has challenged her with.\u00a0 For a moment she does rage as she sweeps her precious hand kept record book and donation papers off her work table.\u00a0 But then she collects herself; she \u00a0ceases to resist.\u00a0 He can stay or leave. She can stay or leave.\u00a0 She is not afraid anymore .\u00a0 And because she is not afraid and now knows her own inner strength, he has lost his power.\u00a0 He can do no more evil to her. \u00a0 Evil can only survive when it has fear to feed on.\u00a0It will take Aydin more time to realize that he has lost his power.\u00a0 He first plans to go Istanbul, the capital city where he can presumably assert himself in a society that 'knows who he is'.\u00a0 But he doesn't go.\u00a0 He is drawn back to the neighbour's house.\u00a0 He drinks (something he never allows himself), loses control and vomits \u2014in front of his friend. He has allowed himself to be totally vulnerable.\u00a0 Metaphorically he too has ceased to resist.\u00a0 Is it too much to say that he has\u00a0 purged himself of not only of his own evil\u00a0but also the false perception of evil in others that has possessed him?\u00a0It does seem that way when the next day on the hunting trip, with a single shot,\u00a0he hits a\u00a0grazing rabbit.\u00a0 But when he approaches his catch he sees it is still breathing.\u00a0 As with his other victims,\u00a0he has known exactly where to aim leaving them barely alive.\u00a0 But were they in truth any more of a threat than a rabbit foraging for a bit of food?\u00a0 The other half of the resistance to evil equation is properly determining what is really 'evil'.\u00a0 Aydin has mistaken his enemies.\u00a0As he returns home, he know that his resistance to what he has perceived as evil (in this case Nihal and her desire for a relationship of mutual respect) has been futile.\u00a0 His voice- over accepts that he has lost Nihal's love.\u00a0 He will not fight for it now, it will be enough if she will simply allow him to be in her presence. But is that the last word?\u00a0 After all, Aydin is a changed man and there is perhaps a good chance that having found himself, he may indeed find a way back to her.",

            "review_title": "A Great Drama, But a Little Long",
            "content": "Winter Sleep won the Palme D'or at Cannes Film Festival in 2014. That is an impressive achievement, something that was accomplished by Tarantino's Pulp Fiction in 1994. It is the highest honor at the Cannes Film Festival. However, watching the over-3-hour picture proves to be at least somewhat of a chore. If the conversations in the film were not so enticing, Winter Sleep would feel like it is longer than 5 hours. Winter Sleep is a very simple movie and a great drama at that, but audiences will not take too kindly to its length.Winter Sleep is comparable to Richard Linklater meeting The Green Mile: there is a lot of philosophical/ethical conversation going on the film which links back to Linklater, but it has the length of a slow drama such as The Green Mile. Though most of the scenes in this movie could be cut down significantly in length yet still have the same effect, every conversational scene in Winter Sleep plays out as if the entire conversation is portrayed. Most of the conversations in this movie involve the protagonist, Aydin, and the editing style of this movie makes you feel like you are truly a part of each conversation and not just observing each one from afar. That being said, this movie plays out like a long stage play, so it is definitely not for everyone, especially audience members that go to the movies for a sense of excitement. If you want to connect to characters, then you will probably enjoy this flick, but forget it if you are expecting any action whatsoever.The main character Aydin is an interesting character to study. He is quite unlikable for a few different reasons. The first thing revealed about him in the movie is that he is a landlord, and like any landlord he butts heads with his tenants. On top of that, he is an arrogant writer who tends to look down on almost everybody around him, and he cannot accept criticism that well, even from his beloved sister. He can also prove to be quite indifferent to other people: he barely shows any emotion when informing one of his tenants that he owes 100 more liras than he had led him to believe for a replacement window for his friend's car.One of the most interesting aspects of the movie is Aydin's failing relationship with his much younger wife, Nihal. One of the best sequences of the film is when Aydin and Nihal have a petty argument about whether Aydin should even be allowed in his house while Nihal is hosting a fundraiser meeting for the organization she is a part of. This leads to Aydin to verbally attack her several scenes later when he realizes his wife has no idea what she is doing in terms of bookkeeping for the funds raised. This may not sound too interesting, but the way it plays out in the film makes it intriguing to follow the conversation and see where and what it will lead to.Winter Sleep is a great character study that could probably shave off at least 20 minutes of its duration and maintain the same effect on audiences. This is a movie to make you think rather than to excite you, and if you like philosophical discussion then you will love Winter Sleep. It is definitely not a movie for everyone, but those who appreciate slow dramas and good character development will praise this as a great film.8/10",

The plot doesn't tell us why such a great actor took a young and beautiful wife and went to live in such a place. Well, i suppose he was a great actor, but when he questioned his sister about a play he worked and she said she didn't watch it, lead us to believe that she never went to a theater to watch a play performed by his brother.

Winter Sleep is a movie about loneliness, the despair of being able to love but not be able to express it, the painful gap between the person you want to be and the person you are, poverty and wilderness-related isolation, the difficult burden of fatherhood, facing your sins, and declaring your desire to leave. How my perfected ego and arrogance are keeping me apart, but I'm not giving up on my values.

If you recall, I said \"the acting\" as if I am talking about every actor in the movie. You are correct, every single actor in this movie is incredible, but I have to give it to Demet Akbag, she particularly inspired me with her talent. It was so beautiful that I couldn't believe she was acting and thought if she was like that in real life too. It's a shame we only saw very little of her. The symbolism in the movie screams at your face in almost every scene, and you feel like you can't hold up with all these complex characters and metaphor etc. Aydin, Nihal and Necla's personalities sometimes wave into each other, and only after the movie you realize each character was actually transforming each other's personalities. The growth Aydin goes through is only so much (which was more believable) and the way to it was told was very well.I will be watching this movie to see more, to feel more. I am not humble enough to NOT say \"I didn't understand this movie\" but I am humble enough to say, \"I only understood very little about this movie\".

            "review_title": "winter sleep",
            "content": "I'm sometimes tempted to make a big deal about the diminished status of foreign-language film, especially when it comes to cinema from unfamiliar countries and non-name-brand filmmakers. Once upon a time that kind of adventurousness represented a kind of cultural aspiration: Even people who never watched such movies vaguely knew they were supposed to, and felt defensive about it. (That defensiveness still comes up sometimes, as in the infamous \"cultural vegetables\" debate a couple of years ago.) Does this decline represent the xenophobic, self-centered, immediate-gratification quality of contemporary pop culture? Well, maybe. But I can't get too excited about it. There's only so much free time in our overworked lives, and a whole lot more watchable TV than there used to be. The number of people willing to break free of comfortable routine and seek out something like Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan's intimate, spectacular and masterful new drama \"Winter Sleep\" is necessarily pretty small.I get it, believe me. If I hadn't spent years going to film festivals and being indoctrinated into a particular way of seeing, I probably wouldn't have heard of Ceylan either, nor would I look forward to each of his new movies with such eagerness. But now that I've tried to drive you away, let me lure you back: \"Winter Sleep,\" winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes this year, is not some impenetrable or arduous art film, full of ambiguous silences and featureless landscapes. (And I say that as someone who will willingly watch such a thing.) It's a gorgeous and luminous work, driven by amazing scenery and affecting human tragedy, that captures the themes driving Ceylan's work and the peculiar cultural status of Turkey, a nation that literally straddles the border between the secular West and the Islamic world. Give this mysterious wide-screen experience 10 minutes, and it absolutely will not let you go. (I'm not going to tell you the daunting running time in precise terms; let's just say you should have dinner first.)Like Ceylan's last film, the slo-mo police drama \"Once Upon a Time in Anatolia\" (also amazing, but admittedly a more demanding a viewing experience), \"Winter Sleep\" is set along a kind of internal border within Turkey, where the nation's educated, Westernized elite encounters deeply rooted traditional culture. Its central character \u2013 it would be a stretch to call him the hero \u2013 is a retired actor named Aydin, played by Haluk Bilginer, himself an eminent Turkish stage and screen actor who's also done numerous roles in English (including five years on the British soap \"EastEnders\"). Aydin is a prominent landlord and hotel proprietor in a remote village of Cappadocia, the high plateau of central Anatolia that's loaded with archaeological and geographical splendors and famous for its wild horses. He has a much younger wife named Nihal (the gorgeous Melisa S\u00f6zen) who has clearly fallen out of love with him, an embittered divorced sister named Necla (Demet Akbag), and an increasingly acrimonious relationship with an impoverished tenant family who haven't paid their rent in months. Soak all of that in booze, snow, egotism and genteel decay, and it's a combustible combination.I described \"Once Upon a Time in Anatolia\" as an episode of \"CSI\" transported to the Turkish outback and rewritten by Anton Chekhov, and while the influence was obvious it was a better guess than I realized. \"Winter Sleep\" is actually adapted from a story by Chekhov, who was obsessed by many of the same intertwined issues of class, caste, property and history that preoccupy Ceylan. While \"Winter Sleep\" never seems \"political\" in the narrow or most obvious sense, Aydin's predicament has everything to do with Turkey's peculiar status between East and West, hemmed in on one side by godless European amorality and on the other by the fiery sword of jihad. One of Aydin's deadbeat tenants is an imam (Serhat Mustafa Kili\u00e7), who is embarrassingly servile to Aydin's face and then curses him behind his back. The imam's brother, an unemployed ex-con named Ismail (Nejat Isler), is less hypocritical, and views Aydin and his wife with a sardonic, predatory intensity that points toward a shocking final confrontation.It's Ismail's preteen son who provides the most obvious inciting incident, breaking Aydin's windshield with a stone in an effort to avenge his father's humiliation. But if that event didn't send these people on a downward spiral, something else would have. There is also Aydin's deepening suspicion that Nihal is having an affair, his thwarted desire to purchase and tame one of the region's wild horses, and his attempt to forge a friendship with a visiting motocross biker who is spending a few days in the hotel. He has settled into the archetypal big-frog-small-pond-role as an eminent citizen of Nowheresville, airing his private grievances in a bitter newspaper column read by no one except his hostile sister, increasingly confronted with his unfulfilled dreams and his deepening unhappiness.But if Aydin is a merciless lampoon of the disempowered intellectual, and perhaps a distorted artistic self-portrait (Ceylan is a 55-year- old filmmaker married to a younger woman; his wife, Ebru, has co-written his last three films), the work that surrounds him is a dense social tapestry, where the intimate, firelit interiors and the severe, astonishing landscape form a symphonic counterpoint. Ceylan and cinematographer G\u00f6khan Tiryaki have forged an artistic collaboration that may drive film-studies theses of the future; the obvious corollary would be the long partnership between Sven Nykvist and Ingmar Bergman, another artist whose influence runs strong in Ceylan's films.If I'm called upon to tell you what \"Winter Sleep\" is about, then the correct answer is not that it's about an aging actor's failing marriage or the class wars of a snowbound tourist village. And yes, it's \"about\" Turkey, but I guarantee you that Ceylan would not claim some variety of human experience can be found in Turkey that is not found in Oklahoma or Brazil.",

Compassionate by nature, he finds himself troubled by his difficulty relating to his family, friends and tenants, causing him to reevaluate his interpersonal relationships.

Throughout the film, we are constantly bombarded with the hopes of confronting the unconscious, expecting to be awakened from this \"winter sleep\" with each tirade, but ultimately all the characters decide and manage to avoid it and \"keep sleeping\" by taking the way that provides short-term comfort to them. In order to make sense of all this escape, the characters also try to prove the righteousness of their escape and the importance of their existence in a world, which doesn't really care about them. They also do it, by painting it with \"honorable and right behavior\". Necla tries to be visible in the eyes of her ex-husband and even considers turning her other cheek, Nihal creates a community and offers a fortune to help the imam's family, which, by the way, was neither requested nor accepted, and Aydin, unlike other theater actors who sold their dignity, managed to remain loyal to the theater for 25 years, is almost disgustingly humble to be an anonymous contributor in charity donations and also again humble enough to be satisfied by his audience in a small local newspaper -where he also reveals his wish to be someone important by saying that he can easily be \"the king\" there.  Ultimately, this movie shows how we put ourselves and our reality into \"winter sleep\" to avoid discomfort.

How far too often attempts at mature, important discussions become a pissing contest of petty psychological attacks, feigning offense or hurt feelings, bringing up the worst of the past, etc. This is made clear, but then Ceylan rather beats us over the head with it with too many examples of such conversations. \nYes, Aydin is a jerk. Necla is foolish for blaming herself for her ex's weakness and alcoholism. Ismail is a fool, period. Hamdi is too much of a nice guy whipping boy. Nihal is naive, but well-meaning. Still, too talkative for my taste. 3.6 stars",

            "content": "Winter Sleep won the Palme D'or at Cannes Film Festival in 2014. That is an impressive achievement, something that was accomplished by Tarantino's Pulp Fiction in 1994.  It is the highest honor at the Cannes Film Festival. However, watching the over-3-hour picture proves to be at least somewhat of a chore. If the conversations in the film were not so enticing, Winter Sleep would feel like it is longer than 5 hours.  Winter Sleep is a very simple movie and a great drama at that, but audiences will not take too kindly to its length.\n\nWinter Sleep is comparable to Richard Linklater meeting The Green Mile: there is a lot of philosophical/ethical conversation going on the film which links back to Linklater, but it has the length of a slow drama such as The Green Mile. Though most of the scenes in this movie could be cut down significantly in length yet still have the same effect, every conversational scene in Winter Sleep plays out as if the entire conversation is portrayed.  Most of the conversations in this movie involve the protagonist, Aydin, and the editing style of this movie makes you feel like you are truly a part of each conversation and not just observing each one from afar.  That being said, this movie plays out like a long stage play, so it is definitely not for everyone, especially audience members that go to the movies for a sense of excitement. If you want to connect to characters, then you will probably enjoy this flick, but forget it if you are expecting any action whatsoever.\n\nThe main character Aydin is an interesting character to study.  He is quite unlikable for a few different reasons.  The first thing revealed about him in the movie is that he is a landlord, and like any landlord he butts heads with his tenants. On top of that, he is an arrogant writer who tends to look down on almost everybody around him, and he cannot accept criticism that well, even from his beloved sister.  He can also prove to be quite indifferent to other people: he barely shows any emotion when informing one of his tenants that he owes 100 more liras than he had led him to believe for a replacement window for his friend's car.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the movie is Aydin's failing relationship with his much younger wife, Nihal. One of the best sequences of the film is when Aydin and Nihal have a petty argument about whether Aydin should even be allowed in his house while Nihal is hosting a fundraiser meeting for the organization she is a part of.  This leads to Aydin to verbally attack her several scenes later when he realizes his wife has no idea what she is doing in terms of bookkeeping for the funds raised.  This may not sound too interesting, but the way it plays out in the film makes it intriguing to follow the conversation and see where and what it will lead to.\n\nWinter Sleep is a great character study that could probably shave off at least 20 minutes of its duration and maintain the same effect on audiences. This is a movie to make you think rather than to excite you, and if you like philosophical discussion then you will love Winter Sleep. It is definitely not a movie for everyone, but those who appreciate slow dramas and good character development will praise this as a great film.\n\n8/10",

However, despite his family's philanthropy and his relatively harmless personal traits, his aloofness and subtle contempt for other people cause the townsfolk and his immediate family to dislike him, sometimes unfairly. When a rude awakening forces him to realize that other people's views of him contradict his self-image, an inner struggle ensues, with an outcome that is far from predictable.

His relationships with all the people around him are distant to say the least due in part to his selfish and skeptical mind brought on by his wealth. The film touches on relationships and marriages and social structors. Through the film there is a constant discourse with how much should a rich person due to help a less fortunate one? Does money really bring you happiness? the film says a resounding No! the issues with this film technically sit with the amount of shots done with 2 characters talking to each other, very impressive penetrative and thought provoking conversations, but minimal in moment. which is one of my pet peeves.

Haluk Bilginer fully inhabits the small-minded man (named Aydin, or \"Intellectual\" in Turkish) who wants to see himself in larger-than-life terms but in fact is the epitome of Sartre's concept of bad faith.  He pretends not to notice the hardships and dissatisfaction of those around him and his role in their fates.  He allows an intermediary to repossess a TV and furniture from his tenants and to threaten them with eviction. He traps his younger wife into a secluded life where she is unable to pursue her own ambitions and he condescendingly meddles when she tries.  But Ceylan asks more questions than he answers. When the wife attempts to act in good faith by donating money to charity and to others who she thinks are needy, has she done the wrong thing or the right thing?  More than once, it is suggested that she just seeks to assuage her own guilt at being well-off and it seems that hand-outs probably don't allow the recipient to retain enough dignity to be acceptable.  Apparently based loosely on Chekhov, the themes are mulled over through conversation after conversation, many ending in bitterness.  Through it all, Aydin has his defences up, even as he seems to be acknowledging his own flaws - an easy trick that anyone can play.  Perhaps this is why the title refers to hibernation and Ceylan sets the film in Turkey's rocky and isolated Cappadocia region; this is a man who has receded into himself, no longer willing to accept that he should act differently or to pay attention to the world around him and the other people in it (aside from his perception of what they are or should be).  Finally, even without all these ideas swirling around, the film would be worth seeing just for the stunning cinematography:  amazing snowy landscapes and cosy fire-lit interiors abound.

            "content": "3  1/2 hours of dialogue probably sounds unbearable to most anyone these days, but Winter Sleep's writing is so damn riveting that the experience actually ends up feeling too short by its end. Each conversation is an epic in itself, some lasting nearly 30 minutes, all of which are complete with their very own arc, and packed with unrelenting tension. I had almost forgotten how suspenseful dialogue on its own can be.  \n\nAction in movies is a little overrated these days, and often just plain stupid, an insult by big-budget industries who have zero confidence in your ability to think anymore.  I'll take the risk of sounding like a pretentious jerk by saying that, as viewers, we've forgotten that a movie doesn't need to be preposterous (e.g., giant robots destroying Manhattan, 5+ superheros in one movie, etc) to be enthralling.  Hold on, because superheros and giant robots definitely have a place in cinema, and those sorts of movies can be loads of fun.  I guess my point is that what really counts at the end of the day, no matter what's happening on screen, is whether a movie can keep its audience in suspense, grip us with a genuine feeling of urgency, and imbue a sense of absolute necessity to all of its events.  Spectacle is great, but we're beginning to forget how engaging drama can be. Winter Sleep is astounding because, despite its inaction, it is rife with tension in every scene.  \n\nThe origin of film belongs just as much to language as it does image, so it shouldn't be surprising that a character-driven drama can be very suspenseful.  Let's take a modern example, a mainstream, yet also mostly favorably critiqued director: Quentin Tarentino.  Words have enormous weight in his films, and they grip just as tightly as his use of imagery or action.  Despite the fact that characters might just be sitting in chairs or standing in hallways, while merely talking, the suspense is electric, and it never lets go.  The tension, the awkwardness, the pain-all the emotions exchanged between characters-they hit with a frightening realness, a palpability primarily known to life yet perfectly communicable through film, just as long as a screenwriter is willing to put in the hard work beforehand. \n\nSimilarly, Winter Sleep has a kind of rhythm and elastic snap to its dialogue that is retained throughout the entire film.  The script is really damn wonderful, and yet, as much as the movie may consist of talking, it never quite seems like a filmed play: it's just as cinematic as it is talky.  Each character feels singularly powerful in their own way, god-like before the camera, if anything just because of how incredibly REAL they feel.  These actors are convincing: every sigh, tear, or bout of a laughter mandates your empathy, your love.  \n\nWhat we have here is a beautifully photographed, sharply written film about marriage, morality, wealth and poverty, and the mysteries of aging into an uncertain future.  The plot concerns a retired theatre actor, Aydin, who runs a small hotel with his beautiful younger wife.  It doesn't take long to see how flawed these characters are, and this is where the entertainment ultimately resides.  I don't want to say much more about the story, but within 15 minutes Winter Sleep will have you.  \n\nYes, these kind of movies take patience, and some dialogue-driven films can be just plain boring; but Winter Sleep blew me away, and it supplied such genuine suspense, the kind that has been missing from the drama genre these days.",

            "content": "Winner of the Palme D'or in 2014, Turkish Director Nuri Bilge Ceylan's Winter's Sleep succeeds on all levels as a cinematic achievement. Just as other movies in his oeuvre, Ceylan again takes a simple story, and combines it with an exquisite cinematography, well-drawn characters, crackling dialogue, stimulating use of image and sound and a well-balanced black humor. The result: a brillant piece of cinema in every aspect.\n\nWhile the film's central theme seems revolving around never-ending tirades and mind games between protagonist and his family and his tenants; actually the film focuses on a man's internal struggle, an array of moral dilemmas, a clash between value systems, a complex tapestry of relationships, and matters of faith and feeling. Also, the humdrum of remote small-town life in the darkest time of winter is exquisitely reflected. Just like his previous work, Ceylan opts again to keep the running time to a considerable length in order to bring a novelistic effect to his simple yet thought-provoking story. It lasts more than 3 hours and has a slow, measured pace, but no single moment or line feels extraneous. It never drags or gets boring. Definitely, he is a story-teller in the true sense. \n\nLike his previous works (such as \"Climates\", \"Distant\" and \"Once upon a Time in Anatolia\") , Nuri Bilge Ceylan again takes advantage of his background of as a photographer. The picture is gorgeous from the first scene to the last, thanks to the wintry Cappadoccian setting. Ceylan creates an out-of-this-world mood, mesmeric and melancholic, suggesting that his characters are somehow cut off from the realities of the world. The attention to authentic details is impeccable. The hotel, that cut directly into rock, serves as a perfect setting for the movie's gloomy atmosphere. Beautifully lit cave-like chambers, with crackling log fires in the background provide an excellent setting for expansively conceived, circular debates. \n\nLikewise, all characters are well-drawn and well-cast. Incomprehension of another's feelings, and intellectual and emotional dissimilarities of characters are exquisitely portrayed, and reflected into ponderously long, but sharp and crackling dialogue. From cynical, selfish and privileged Ayd?n (Haluk Bilginer) to fragile, oppressed and embattled wife Nihal (Melisa S\u00f6zen), and to confused, depressed and resentful sister Nermin (Demet Akba?), all characters are trapped in their cocoons of emotional loneliness and insipid existences.\n\nG\u00f6khan Tiryaki's cinematography is outstanding in the use of lights, shadows and dark contrasts that enhance the story to such an extent. Majority of scenes starts with a long shot in long take with static cameras. Indoor scenes are intercut with powerful close-ups, all with the flavor of artsy photography; with reverse, changing camera angles and pans and tilts. Sharpness and colors are glorious too. \n\nLast word: Pure, plain and gripping, one of the best films of 2014. This is a kind of movie that makes you think over and over again about the distances inherent to human relationships. (8.4/10)",

            "content": "This film first caught my attention not because of its Palme d'Or glory but because of its haunting poster, which to me looks like an illustration of a winter night by Isaac Levitan (my favourite painter) from a gloomy Russian novel about existentialism by Dostoevsky. The poster turned out to be very true to the spirit of the film but also a huge \"spoiler\" to whom paid close attention to its details. The film has a very exotic setting, and an extremely beautiful one - a Turkish remote region with strangely-shaped houses, which look like primitive caves but in fact provide the best shelters for the people there during the lengthy white days of the winter. Such remoteness and exoticness may fit well for tourism but it has tremendous and negative influence over the gloomy and defeatist residents, including the odd couple Aydin-Nihal, who are the two sole black figures in front of the white background of the poster. This is a long film, very long one (3 hours and 16 minutes) with more than one hour opening that gives me no signal about how this film could win the Palme d'Or over such films like \"Two Days, One Night\", \"Leviathan\", or \"Wild Tales\" (the latter two actually made the shortlist of Oscars this year, while \"Winter Sleep\" did not). It was all about the colourless and tepid life of the reclusive landlord Aydin, who seemed to be very comfortable with an uneventful life of inspecting his assets, having nice little chats with his wife Nihal and recently-divorced sister Necla or his guests, and spending the end of the day writing witty pieces for newspapers. But as the film went pass the 1-hour milestone, things got loose, and the real depressing face of Aydin was gradually revealed as well as the strained relationship between him and Nihal, and to a lesser extent, Necla. True to its psychological cinema style, all those revelations were brought to the audience mostly through the conversations between Aydin and people around him, which were calm and peaceful in most parts but always contained a deep yet violent undercurrents. Those were the undercurrent of a young wife, who still wants to thrive, to really live, against a conformist old husband, who talks endlessly about \"freedom\" for her but in fact desperately wants to keep her close despite her obvious hostility towards him, undercurrent of the poor yet righteous tenants against their greedy and hypocritical landlord. The more we watch, the more we despite the hypocrisy and greed of Aydin, and strangely enough, at the same time feel pity for him since he himself, as an actor on stage as well as in real life, seems to forget already what is the joy of living, or try to conform him and people around him from the harsh (yet interesting) aspect of lives through his \"acting\" but deeply sad smiles and torrents of moral talks. When the snow fell to sink the whole region in a thick and gloomy white cover is also when the film, and its characters, turned into their finest moments. It seems that the wildness of the winter acted as a catalyst to the emotional explosions within the residents. The only difference is the way each character reacts with such disruption. Nothing too dramatic or philosophical happened, but the audience could still feel the itching desire for true existence of each character especially through the ever haunting eyes of Nihal and numerous forced smiles of her husband. The ending monologue thus is very touching, resoundingly relatable, and gives us some moments of solaces when Aydin finally showed his true face, his true feelings. Still, I would love if the film could focus on just one aspect of Aydin's character development or Aydin-Nihal relationship, not both, because 196 minutes, although long they are, are still not enough to cover such profound human nature and human relationship. Yes, I felt a little bit irritating because the film did so well in depicting both aspects, simply that such length was not enough for two complete pictures of a \"winter sleep\" in one single frame. Still, a film that can give the audience a haunting and unanswered question - \"should we have a winter sleep to preserve our dying strength and desires for a spring that may never come - like a rabbit shot dead by the hunter in the snowy steppe before being able to experience the fresh grass of spring?\" is one hell of a film.",

Previous films have told the truth about life in an ivory tower, but never with the depth, passion and reality of this Turkish masterpiece.  Aydin (Haluk Bilginer) engages in riveting verbal warfare with his wife Nihal and delivers the best performance by an actor this year, in the best film of the year - by far.  The supporting cast is superb.  Why has Hollywood given up on this kind of filmmaking?",

            "content": "Serving as a much praised Turkish film, Winter Sleep sounded like a good chance to step to into world cinema.\n\nPerhaps one thing that messed up Winter Sleep for me was the fact that my expectations for the film were not met. Consideirng that the poster and the trailer emphasised the Turkish setting during Winter as the source of much of the drama. Due to this, I expected that the scale of the story would be a lot bigger and that there would be a lot of emphasis on the setting. This didn't prove to be true as the film used the setting minimally, opting instead to use 196 minutes of dialogue.\nWinter Sleep is mostly composed of extended scenes of dialogue. Director Nuri Bilge Ceylan uses these to depict the inner workings of all the characters and examine the complex nature of the relationships that they share in their society. There are some intriguing moments, but it is such a slow piece. The pacing in Winter Sleep is incredibly slow, following a more realistic style of conversation that occurs in life. The dialogue in the film is extended and not dramatized at all, nor is it made more stylish by the visual elements of the film. It all happens naturally which means that it demands viewers to be able to embrace every aspect of the script. I simply could not. Winter Sleep defied my expectations and did it by focusing on nothing but talking throughout a slow pace for extended running time. I mean, the scenery in the film was beautiful and its setting was intriguing, but for one that is so unconventional and new to the world of cinema I had expected more from it. Winter Sleep was a film which had a lot of characters who shared complex relationships due to the political nature of the setting, but that just didn't interest me. There were so many characters to keep up with who all played seriously prominent roles in the story, and although they were written with depth and strong dialogue, I just couldn't get into it. Winter Sleep was not the sweeping spectacle I was expecting, it was simply an overlong and slow bore in Turkish which made it even more difficult to get a grasp on. \nWinter Sleep has both so little and so much going on in the sense that the focus is all around the characters while there are plenty of them. This makes it a challenge to keep up with everything, and the fact that the film was not interesting to me failed to give me a reason to try. I really did and I enjoyed some parts of Winter Sleep, but more than 3 hours of nothing but talking in such a high concept setting with a lot of potential is not the most interesting piece of cinema to me. It was nothing but a lot of waiting while I failed to grasp what was interesting about who the characters were or what they were saying. The Turkish setting was a nice spin on things, but I expected more to come from the way that things transitioned to winter as one of the key themes. Instead, it was used largely as a subtheme and as symbolism for the cold nature of the relationship that Mr. Aydin shares with everyone, particularly his wife. These concepts have potential, but the way they are executed are on a level of drama which was too subtle for me to really feel something from. The dramatic impact of Winter Sleep is not that powerful because it goes at a really realistic angle on the story, and I commend Nuri Bilge Ceylan for trying that out. But for my first step into Turkish cinema to be more than three hours of that is really a bit much of a step. My opinion of Winter Sleep is partially affected by the fact that I have not had much experience in Turkish cinema before, and I will admit that the film intrigued me enough to keep looking into what else was on offer from Turkey. But Winter Sleep is too much as a first step. Winter Sleep really lived up to none of my expectations and it didn't entertain me. Even though it is a very unconventional film, it didn't challenge me much either. It only challenged my patience, and it worked pretty hard at lulling me into a sleep. It's hard enough to keep up with three hours of dynamics when a film cannot keep you awake, so I can really just confirm that Winter Sleep was not a film I was ready for and not a film I will likely remember throughout life. I appreciate certain aspects of it, but when you can only enjoy parts of an entire 196 minute film, then there is a problem.\nThe primary aspects aside from the scenery that I enjoyed in Winter Sleep were the efforts of the actors because everyone made an impressive effort. But the standout surely is Haluk Bilginer.\nHaluk Bilginer leads Winter Sleep incredibly well. With a sense of wisdom under his belt which also touches upon a sense of self-indulgence, Haluk Bilginer delivers a performance rich with inner drama and gentle line delivery which grasps the nature of the story very nicely. He interacts with the surrounding cast in the film with incredible strength as an actor which is able to bring the best out of both him and whoever he shares the screen with. He puts a complex level of meaning into the role of Mr. Aydin. His scenes with Melisa Sozen are particularly the most interesting as it depicts the disintegrating marriage between them and shows both actors working hard to empower each other. It works out well, and so Haluk Bilginer's performance in Winter Sleep remains one of the most memorable elements of it.\n\nSo Winter Sleep has strong direction from Nuri Bilge Ceylan and a meaningful central performance from Haluk Bilginer, but that isn't enough to turn 196 minutes of dialogue into anything more than a slow and esoteric film.",
