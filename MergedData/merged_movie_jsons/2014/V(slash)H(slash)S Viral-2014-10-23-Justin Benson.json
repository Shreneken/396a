            "content": "This movie is borderline unwatchable. I tried watching this in two sittings and by the third I fell asleep. It's so bad, it's like they hunted down the worst horror writers and directors in hopes to sabotage a continuing V/H/S franchise and they succeeded. The camera-work is horrendous. It makes the final fight in Alex Cross look like The Raid 2. Awkward edits, annoying static every five seconds, terribly uninteresting plots and terribly written too. It's a shame because there was much potential from the first two V/H/S movies that this could become a good horror anthology franchise because it's such a great premise and found-footage is best in small 20-30 minutes doses but this movie tried to make an actual story with a couple random segments that make no sense. Gun to my head, if I had to pick the best segment it would have to be the one with the alien penises. That sentence alone should tell you enough about this movie. It was such a dumb segment and it made no sense but actually attempted suspense and some form of story. The main story is dogsh*t. I hate this movie a lot. I remember thinking after V/H/S/2 \"man, what a great idea for a horror franchise. I hope they continue these\" and then Viral had to come along and take a heaping dump on film and sell it as a V/H/S movie. If you liked the first two V/H/S movies, don't watch this. Don't ever watch this movie unless you want to feel depressed and p*ssed off in which case by all means V/H/S: Viral is the only thing you should watch. This movie sucks balls. It should have never been made and whoever greenlit this atrocious script should be fired if they haven't been already. I wish I could unwatch this movie. Spare yourselves.",

A couple of the \"videos\" were mildly entertaining, and the one dealing with the alternate universe had great potential, that was, until the end. I watched this with a group of friends and we found ourselves laughing more than anything and questioning if this was a joke or if we were watching VHS to begin with. I am pretty much writing this review just tell anyone who is remotely interested in seeing this to save your money. If you just can not resist, try to watch it with friends so you can, A) split the price of renting/buying it, and B) enjoy sharing laughs with them at the expense of the ridiculousness of this film.

            "content": "I'm not the biggest fan of \"found footage\" films. Too often they are just an excuse for a cheap gimmick that involves POV-style camera work and story, character, and plot are always quick to suffer and be left in the dust. The \"V/H/S/\"films do little to not fall down this trap as the entire franchise is built on short, anthology collection of tales that are all about asking the question, \"Wouldn't it be cool if we saw this from the perspective of nutjobs who film every aspect of their lives?\" The first two films are pretty lazy and forgettable, in my book, and this one, essentially, is not much different. There's no real central story hub that the other stories branch off from like in the previous two and the editing is chaotic, sloppy, and an almost incoherent mess. However, and I found this shocking, the stories are actually better constructed than they've been in the other films.Granted, the stories are still far from being grand tales but they are easier to digest and are not just quickly thrown together events made to utilize the gimmick. I will admit that I found the central story awful, terribly put together, and a complete waste of time but the other stories\u2014ones that involve a magician with an evil cloak, demon battling skaters, and a dude that discovers a parallel world\u2014to be fairly decent. Sure, some of them don't live up to the potential they have, suffer all the usual pitfalls that \"found footage\" films suffer from, and, sometimes, just end on an outright silly note but they have more direction than the other films have offered.While there is clearly some improvement in this third film, the final product is still a really sloppy one and is very poorly constructed. The movie feels incomplete (maybe due to a whole story being edited out before it hit the Video On Demand market) and comes off like a quick, needless sequel.Hi! The name is Rev.

I was looking forward to watching VHS: Viral after seeing VHS2, because I thought they'd gotten a solid pattern down. But no.No, instead you get skateboarding teens looking \"totally rad\" while fighting a group of cultists (seriously.) And then, after fending off the angry mob, the 15-year-old boys skate home.VHS: Viral offers four stories: the magician story, the multi-universe story, the aforementioned skateboarding brats yarn, and a wraparound that ties all these vignettes together. These stories all stink except for \"Parallel Monsters,\" which is good enough to warrant its own film.If you can, watch \"Parallel Monsters\" without wasting your time with the rest of this sequel.",

            "review_title": "Worst film of the year?",
            "content": "The third installment in this fairly admired cult series, is not only the worst in the series, but maybe the worst film I've been subjected to in a year that has already seen two Adam Sandler and three Kevin Hart movies.First off, if you don't know how these films are constructed, parts one and two use a framing device where characters (all amidst their own scary situations) watch found V/H/S tapes, which depict 3 found-footage, low budget horror short films (all from different directors). In \"V/H/S: Viral\" the three shorts are held together (like glue) by the story of a guy trying to film a supposed car chase, which becomes (from what I can decipher) a stupid commentary on the lack of coherent content in videos uploaded by teenagers that go viral, in this day and age. But wait, that doesn't sound like a plot which would contain a segment where someone watches V/H/S tapes. Well, that's because it doesn't. Here's my point: Would it be a valid criticism to say that in a movie called \"V/H/S: Viral\", the fact that it contains not one actual V/H/S tape throughout its 82 minute runtime, was a drastic misstep? I believe so.But (you ask yourself) even though the glue of the film was lacking, maybe the short films throughout were its saving grace? Uhhh, NOPE! With low budget film techniques and visuals ranging from passable to downright hokey, there is absolutely no reason to watch this film; or read the rest of this review. But I guess, if you have nothing better to do, you can read on and find out more about the individual shorts \"Viral\" has to offer.The first short, \"Dante the Great\", directed by Gregg Bishop, is about a lame magician, who finds a magical cloak and becomes a big star. But just like Audrey 2 in \"Little Shop of Horrors\", this cloak apparently needs to be fed. Verdict: Good premise, but poor visuals, with a story that goes nowhere.The second short, \"Parallel Monsters\", directed by Nacho Vigalondo, sees my favorite premise, where a man creates a door to an alternate universe, only to have a conversation with his alternate self. During this conversation, they both agree to switch places for 15 minutes. Verdict: This short really had me leaning forward in my seat, until it suddenly took a sophomoric turn, choosing to focus on alien genitalia. The visuals in this short were also the worst of the three, as the genitalia in question were obviously hand puppets (puppetry of the penis?).The third one, \"Bonestorm\", directed by\u0085oh, who cares; it's probably better that I don't divulge this directors name, since his short is by far the worst of the three. This GoPro driven story sees a handful of obnoxious punk skater-boys, who are teenagers and have guns for some reason. They decide to go to Tijuana after hearing about an \"awesome skate spot\". Problem is, this location happens to be the home of some of the strongest, yet weakest Mexican Satan worshipers ever put to film. From there, we see things get shot and hit with skateboards for way too long.The biggest issue I had with these shorts was that not for one moment was I scared. And this was clearly advertized as a HORROR MOVIE. ITunes, can I have my money back? Final Thought: Even though I wasn't a vehement apologist of the last two films of the series, like other critics I know, the premises (for the most part) made sense. Yes, none of the actual videos have any sort of connection, but they never have. What I am talking about is the framing device used here, which in the past had only been used to facilitate the showing of the main attraction (the shorts). In \"V/H/S: Viral\" the framing device makes absolutely no sense, with an ending that is so incoherent, that when the main female lead proceeds to continuously bang her head against a wall during the final minutes, I wanted to join her in this action, if only to avoid watching any more of this movie.",

When the second one came around I was skeptical at first but surprisingly it was even better than its predecessor in every way (V/H/S 2 is about my favorite horror movie of all time) So naturally I had no doubts that the 3rd movie would be fantastic. The trailer sure looked so...But unfortunately V/H/S Viral feels rushed. I mean some individual stories are actually quite captivating. \"Parallel Monsters\" for example had a very unsettling and yet realistic atmosphere to it. \"Dante the Great\" also had an awesome premise although I fell like it could've been more.But the rest was just uninspired and loose. Especially \"Vicous Circles\" felt like it had no consistency at all. Generally I like it if a film does not explain everything but here there is no explanation for anything. It just has a constant stream of events that connect only vaguely. Often time the pacing of the segments was just off which made it hard to get involved in the story.But it wasn't just the storytelling it was also the overall audiovisual quality of the whole movie. There were some good practical effects but a lot of bad cgi that really stuck out and really killed the mood. While the first two installments really incorporated the found footage presentation in their cinematography, we only see this rarely in V/H/S Viral.All in all with some more time spend in pre- and post-production V/H/S Viral would've been a much better experience.",

            "content": "Why are people hating on this movie? They're getting basically what they got in the first film! A series of incoherent found footage films strung together with a premise slimmer than an anorexic's g-string!It really isn't any better or any worse than the other films in the series. It may be the weakest yet it still has something to offer. You've got one great film, Parallel Monsters, very spooky, very trippy. One pretty good film that slowly grows on you, Bonestorm, which is saying something, since I really hate skateboarders. One highly mediocre film, Dante the Great, that's like something out of a lame SyFy Channel movie yet still watchable, and the wrap around film to tie it altogether, (the not so) Vicious Circles, the weakest of the bunch.Plus there's a short and incoherent section of what looks like a bunch of Latino gangbangers having a party and one vato flips out and slaughters them all for no apparent reason. Weird. Loco.And there's a gratuitous helping of cringe inducing gore, i.e. a man being dragged to pieces from a moving truck.You're never getting a masterpiece of horror from the V/H/S movies, you're getting what's expected. One annoyance is the opening segment uses far too much feedback noise, a little of that goes a long way.Free your mind and watch it for what it is, something to see and enjoy once and forget it!

CGI VHS static and CGI firecrackers? And I am not speaking of those skeleton exploding effects. I am speaking of the fire cracker one of these fools throws around before the madness happens. You could not do this by practical effects and save some money for a movie which after all looks quite cheap?Conclusion: I really liked both its predecessors, but this movie is a huge wast of time - although its only 80 minutes long.

The first story doesn't feel like it belongs in a VHS movie and the tone doesn't match. It's something your mom would like.The middle story starts out promising but manages to feel like a parody of itself by the end. My favorite (?) of the bunch.The third story feels like it should be airing on MTV in 2003. Another bummer is that the directors have done good movies (Resolution and Timecrimes), I don't know how they lost their mojo here. Also, there are only three stories. I'm cool with a shorter movie if it's a better movie, but they cut the fourth. People speculate bit was axed because it was so bad.

            "content": "First I'd like to say, as with any horror film, the less you know about the film going in the better it will be. For those wondering if they should spend their money on this. I would say wait for Netflix, IMO it does not live up to the previous VHS movies, and actually seems to lose what the unique premise was. I love VHS and I liked VHS 2 a good bit, but this feels like a drop off of sorts. If VHS was a 9 and VHS 2 was a 7.5 then VHS Viral is probably an average of 5.5 (but the second segment is a MUST SEE). The previous 2 movies have gotten many talented young horror film makers and collectives together to make interesting short films. VHS was probably my favorite horror film of 2012, some of the shorts fell flat (static monster and connecting story) but most of the others are really amazing, especially the last. VHS 2 lacked some of the originality but still felt like a solid horror film. VHS Viral just feels like it lacks the same vision and direction that VHS 1 and 2 had.Whether you like it or hate it VHS is built around the idea of playing with portable cameras, experimenting with the \"found footage\" horror sub-genre, and really presenting a horror film from the POV of those going through it. It is basically like a haunted house on film, some with interesting stories and ideas. VHS 2 didn't really revolutionize anything but was still interesting. It stuck with the premise and kept it going in interesting ways. Probably my biggest issue with VHS Viral is that it ostensibly completely drops the found footage premise, but still sticks with the found footage type editing and shooting. This breaks the immersion, which is The whole point of found footage stuff. As you can tell I didn't like the movie for the most part. The second segment is the ONLY reason it even has 4 stars out of 10. Ultimately though I am disappointed because they didn't really try anything interesting with the found footage format, especially the way that the previous 2 films did. Also 3 segments feels too short, even though this film has a lot of filler.",

Stylised editing techniques further hamper the credibility of the found footage (this being most notable in the final story).However, despite these issues, V/H/S/Viral still manages to be quite a bit of fun as a whole, with a trio of inventive tales amidst the chaos of messy wraparound story Vicious Circles from director Marcel Sarmiento, in which a young man on a bike gives chase to the renegade ice cream truck that has abducted his girlfriend while viral videos warp the minds of people in his neighbourhood (!?!).The first of the separate stories, Dante The Great, is directed by Gregg Bishop (Dance of the Dead) and stars Justin Welborn as famous illusionist Dante, who owes his success to a supernatural cloak rumoured to have once belonged to Harry Houdini. The only problem is that, in exchange for his magical powers, Dante must feed the cloak human victims, and the mysterious disappearance of several of his assistants doesn't escape the attention of the police for very long. Admittedly this story is extremely silly but it is hugely entertaining, with lots of impressive visual effects and a few spots of splattery gore (a person's abdomen being magically opened up to reveal bloody ribs and innards being the best moment). Oh, and there's a great jolt to be had right at the end.Next up is Nacho Vigalondo's Parallel Monsters, my favourite segment of the whole film, which sees a scientist opening a door to a parallel dimension where he meets his doppelganger. The two excited scientists agree to swap realities for 15 minutes but soon discover some startling differences between their two worlds. An absolutely demented but not very scary story that delivers toothy wangs and giant vagina dentata, this one gives Cronenberg a run for his money in the weirdness stakes.The third tale, Bonestorm, directed by Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead, is little more than an excuse to pit a bunch of Larry Clark-style teenage slackers against the undead, using their skateboards as weapons. The story makes very little sense, and the only jumps on offer are of the skateboard variety, but the excess of Evil Dead-style splat-stick proves entertaining enough to excuse the lack of a decent narrative or shocks. This one uses a video camera and several GoPro cameras to capture the action, but ignores all the rules of the found footage genre by utilising fancy editing gimmicks including freeze frame and DePalma style split screen.Marcel Sarmiento wraps up proceedings by concluding Vicious Circles in a muddled fashion that will leave viewers none the wiser about his intended message (if, indeed, there was one).6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for the dog with the barbecue fork stuck in his head.",

However, while following the same manuscript and how-to-make-an-anthology recipe, then \"V/H/S Viral\" just didn't have as much appeal as the previous movies, especially the second movie in the franchise.This seemed like a scramble of different stories put together, certainly, but there was little given to the audience in terms of building up the characters or setting the scene, so it was straight into the stories and action, for better or worse. It didn't really work out all that great, because the characters were essentially pointless and shallow, offering nothing to the audience to relate to.The different segments were of very varied quality and interest, but overall just landed well below a mediocre value. In fact, the entire stew of this movie just was dragged down by a pointless narrative and equally pointless characters.

            "content": "'V/H/S: VIRAL': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The third installment in the popular 'V/H/S' found-footage anthology horror series. This one features three short films and a wraparound story; mostly dealing with teens obsessed with internet fame. The shorts were directed by Nacho Vigalondo, Marcel Sarmiento, Gregg Bishop, Justin Benson and Aaron Scott Moorhead. They were written by the directors; as well as T.J. Cimfel, Ed Dougherty and David White. I loved the first two movies and found this one to be almost equally as crazy and entertaining! The film tells the story of a young man, in a serious relationship, who's more concerned about capturing the next viral video than he is about his love life. So when he sees, on the news, that someone is driving an ice cream truck insanely around town (killing people), he is obsessed with getting it on video. Even though his girlfriend, Iris (Emilia Ares Zoryan), asks him to stay with her and ignore it. On the van are a bunch of potentially viral videos, containing their own horrific stories. The three central videos (shown) tell the stories of a crazed magician on a killing spree, a machine that opens the door to a parallel world and a group of teen skaters hunted by demonic forces in Mexico. Although the film has a lot of flaws, I still love how bizarrely original and crazy it is. It's so random, unpredictable and fast paced that you have to just sit back and enjoy the ride of it all (and not think too much about whether it all makes sense or not). A lot of the characters often do a lot of irrational things, and some of the effects are kind of cheap and cheesy, but if you can ignore all of that it's a lot of fun. It's not quite as good as the first two movies and it does sometimes feel like more of a satire than a frightening horror film (although the gore is unreal). It also doesn't always follow the rules of a normal found-footage film either, but it does have some great commentary on the internet obsessed world we all now live in. Some shorts are better than others (I really enjoyed 'DANTE THE GREAT' and 'PARALLEL MONSTERS') but even as a whole, most fans of the series shouldn't be disappointed!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/FqAO2eQsONk",

Viral takes that film premise and makes a mockery out of it.

There were two good concepts with two of the vids but still not enough to save the movie.Everything is more unexplained than the first two movies: why are we watching this, where did these come from, are these actual events and more.

Its a very cool idea to play with but it wasn't ended properly.Parallel Monsters was good for the first minutes or so but when they are doing their things it just goes way down hill and there is never any sort of explanation for the hell is supposed to be going on, its just confusing.Bonestorm had so much potential but had some major flaws. I don't understand why the camera guy kept lying to them about filming, it was just a waste of several lines. but the worst parts about it were that the fight scene could have been so much cooler had it not been so up close like that and we never got to see whatever came out at the end.and truth be told I'm not even sure what Gorgeous Vortex was, there were only 3 videos and then the main story type deal, so if someone could help me out on that one.Overall, the movie is poorly executed and fails to even touch the other 2 in terms of horror and creativity",

I thought this was a fantastic little horror anthology flick that redeemed the \"V/H/S\" franchise from a pretty poor second installment. (And apparently fans liked that one?)I'd give this a 9 out of 10. It certainly isn't for everybody, with its violence, gore and disturbing content. (I'm going to repeat that: as with past \"V/H/S\" films, this has some disturbing content, so beware.) But it should be a damned scary treat for hardcore horror fans.This time out, we've got three short films linked together by a running \"wraparound\" film. (A fourth segment was edited out.)The first is like a damn good episode of \"The X Files.\" The fight with the cops was fantastic, and the special effects were surprisingly good for a \"V/H/S\" movie.The second film is a wonderfully creative horror/science fiction tale that plays out like a terrific classic short story. (Yes, it begins a bit slow, but I think that's an intentional part of the narrative.) This segment gets extra points for its unabashed use of some not-so-subtle Freudian body horror.The third film isn't perfect, with a thin story and some schlock horror cheesiness. But it's still really entertaining, thanks to the teen skateboarder anti-heroes (and their \"photographer guy\" tagalong) that were scripted perfectly and then performed perfectly by their young actors. I am still laughing at how one character threatens to \"pistol whip\" another for interrupting him. These kids were great. They're perfect malcontents at first \u2014 then, thanks to a nice flourish in the script involving a homeless person \u2014 they're shown to have more depth than that. Gimme a full-length feature film starring these brats. I'm serious.Finally, the wraparound tale's finale was brutal and perfect. And what a great use of classical music!A few things left me scratching my head:1) We learn little about the story's antagonist in the wraparound tale \u2014 exactly who or what is responsible for the speeding ice-cream truck? I wanted to know more, despite the story's deliberate ambiguity.2) Why does the main character's girlfriend in the wraparound story enter the truck?3) How do people on bicycles manage to keep pace with the speeding truck? One of them is a bicycle made for a young girl. They \u0085 even outpace the pursuing police cars?Forget the haters, check this out.Oh!! One more thing \u2014 if you view this via Netflix, as I did, you'll find that the entire second segment is in Spanish. You can fix this just by wiggling Netflix' captions function at the bottom right.",

The segments are decent but the wraparound is just terrible.Here is a short review of each of the wraparound and segments.Vicious Circles AKA The Wraparound (dir:Marcel Sarmiento): A couple gets embroiled in a wild chase between an ambulance and the cops. Showing the worst of the shaky cam, this one starts out okay but ends with a whimper.Dante the Great (dir:Gregg Bishop): A loser magician gets his hands on a cloak belonging to Houdini and becomes a star but the cloak has a dark side. A very fun segment with some seriously cool effects.Parallel Monsters (dir:Nacho Vigalondo): A man discovers a parallel universe with a machine where he finds his counterpart and both decide to do a fun experiment which goes horribly wrong. The best segment of the film, this one is funny, unpredictable and not to mention, genuinely creepy.Bonestorm (dir:Aaron Moorhead & Justin Benson): A group of slackers go into Tijuana for drugs and partying but run into trouble. They decide to fight back. A good start to a segment which lasts way too long. Becomes incoherent and irritating after a point.Overall, V/H/S: Viral is quite disappointing.

These films terrorize a woman in the primary storyline. There are six directors who helped make this film including Justin Benson (Spring and Endless), Marcel Sarmiento (ABCs of Death) and Todd Lincoln (The Apparition). This picture stars Emilia Ares (American Horror Story: 1984), Steve Berens (I Am Legend), Garrett Bales (This is Us) and Ryan Staats (From Dusk till Dawn the Series). The storylines and filming style for this didn't feel as well done as the previous two pictures. It didn't really work for me. The storylines were uneven and some were awkward. There are some entertaining circumstances in this that were fun to watch unfold. There are also some solid kill scenes with good gore and I absolutely adored the skateboard segment in this.

I'm OK with that and actually find it to be a fun idea. We also see the same concept in the ABC's of Death anthology films. The only downside is that we never get a full grasp of the segments. Granted, some leave a lot to the imagination of the viewer, but some are so vague its hard to piece together. The first two V/H/S films were no gems, but each had 2 or so segments that stood out and actually engaged us while the others tended to disappoint. This new film continued that trend. the downside is that there were only 3 segments this time (not including the wraparound) which I found highly disappointing.The wraparound was utterly boring and uninteresting. I get the irony of the guy wanting to go viral, but the tie-in at the end was confusing and forgettable. Dante the Great was cheesy and added no horror value. Some of the visuals with the cloak were cool while some were low-budget. A power-obsessed redneck magician is just not an appealing story.Bonestorm was absolutely annoying. The shaky go-pro cams and the characters \"bottom or the barrel\" personalities gave me nothing to root for. There was just nothing there for me to grasp or understand to make this engagingGorgeous Vortex was the only gem of this film. The ability to travel into an alternate universe and switch sides with your counterpart was pretty cool. The subtle differences they start off with only gives you clues that this isn't just a reflected world, but that something very strange and evil was happening. The only downside of this segment was that we wanted to see the main character explore the rest of the world even though he can't because of time. Also, the realization of the horror of this segment might seemed far- fetched to some, but I think it was an interesting add to make it that much weirder. All in all, one good segment cannot carry an entire movie whether it has 6, 26, or in this case 4 stories. I hope this series continues because they are fun....and now I expect them every year, but they are going to have to hold their writers to stricter script ideas and lay off too much independence because thing can get cheesy really quickly!",

Sadly I wasn't.The only way to fairly review these films is to break them down into their segments:Vicious Circles - not sure exactly what was going on here to be honest. A confusing segment that might take a couple of watches to get my head around (I won't bother mind you). Dante the Great - the worst of the bunch. The excuse for the camera filming things was pathetic and the story was just embarrassing. A magic cape? How did they ever get past the stage of pitching this? Terrible acting, terrible story, terrible segment.Parallel Monsters - my pick of the bunch. An enticing set up and then a so-so execution. Could have been better, could have been worse. A good filmmaker could have done a lot with this segment. The potential was all there. Even so it's not bad.Bonestorm - another lame idea with no sense behind the story. This segment wasted an enormous amount of our time simply showing skateboarding tricks, only for the pay off to feel like a video game where the kids weren't even scared (so how are we meant to be?) and refused to run away. The monsters were creepy enough to make a good segment out of. Director Aaron Moorhead just failed to do so.I kept thinking to myself 'this just needs a master director to come along with a mind blowing segment and all else will be forgiven'. Then I come on here and see Rob Zombie was in talks to do a segment but they couldn't agree on how it was to be done. Are you kidding me! When this is what you have, you can't afford to be fussy.

It is a shame, really, because the production values are actually higher than at least the first movie, and the stories had potential. Unfortunately, the execution is seriously flawed, with the exception of the \"parallel monsters\" segment.Already the opening shots, rapidly intercutting an intimate romantic scene at what will turn out to be the setting of the film's climax with ordinary slices of life, only to be then mixed with footage of a police chase that extends over the movie, can be quite bewildering. Unfortunately, even the head-scratching reveal at the end does not help much to make sense of what this is all about.Then there is the decision to divorce the individual segments from story devices that announce them, e.g. The loading of a video tape. Consequently, when the segment appears, we don't know why the movie suddenly decided to switch from the wrap-around story to the story-within-the-story.The first segment, \"Dante the Great \", a Faustian tale of a magician who can do more than mere tricks has actually quite good visuals, but the pace is rushed throughout and the presentation is annoyingly inconsistent. Parts of the story are told in a mockumentary format, while other parts are told in a way that is logically inconsistent with the mockumentary narrative. It makes for a jarring experience and brings the segment down.The second in-story segment is \"parallel monsters\" and stands head and shoulders above the rest of the film. It is probably best not to know what it is about before viewing it, but suffice it to say that it can be read as social satire dressed as parallel universe science fiction. The writer/director Nacho Vigalondo is well known for ingenious and innovative concept-based stories (His TIMECRIMES (2007) is one of the best time travel thrillers ever, and his segment \"A is for Apocalypse\" in the horror anthology ABCs OF DEATH is also one of the best in that one). Had the other segments of this film been as good, this would have been the best of the three V/H/S films.The third story segment, \"Bonecrush\" follows some aspiring social media skate boarder teens who take a trip to Tijuana in order to produce a viral skateboarding video. There they encounter a supernatural cult seemingly intent on killing them. The segment has a hyperkinetic style, which seems appropriate for the skateboarding theme. But then the story devolves into a protracted fighting sequence between the teens and the cultists, and the hyperkinetic style ends up emphasizing its repetitiveness. Consequently, we lose interest even before the segment ends abruptly and inconclusively.Evidently, there was also a fourth segment, but it was cut out.In summary, the movie is quite chaotic, both in its overall structure and in its details, and is therefore bound to leave the viewer confused, if they did not already stop caring.If you can see the \"parallel monsters\" segment by itself, I recommend it highly, but unfortunately I cannot extend my recommendation to the rest of the movie, unless you are die-hard fan of found footage horror.",

Of course the problem with these anthology movies is that the quality also depends on the directors selected. And the directors for this piece of crap are pretty dire. The only reason why I am not rating it lower is because of one segment : Parallel Monsters. Nacho Vigalando's career has been interesting and I am definitely a fan of his sci fi horror movies. Here also in the segment Parallel monsters, he delivers. Frankly this was the only time I felt creeped out and the segment was going from strength to strength. The whole segment has a David Cronenberg feel and such a good segment seems out of place in this amateurish anthology movie.The Dante the great segment is absolutely terrible, I don't understand what that was supposed to do. I guess maybe they intended for it to be a horror segment but it hasn't turned out that way. Apparently Justin welborn should not really act, he has absolutely zero talent judging by this movie. The whole thing seemed like a bad TV episode with cheesy acting and effects. Bonestorm - What the hell was this all about? What language were they speaking? The clich\u00e9d lines and obvious attempts to appeal to tweeners are incredibly stupid. Obviously horror movies about skater dudes are not really my cup of tea (or anyone's for that matter). And even then it could be done much better rather than this amateurish crap. It is absolutely hilarious. I can't really see much of what happens with \"skater dudes\" doing hand to hand combat with supposed zombies and in return thankfully two annoying people do get killed. Lastly talking about the main story....well here it is in no way effective or creepy, it doesn't really link the stories well. Well there is no time to build atmosphere or take a breath when the guy is going full speed on his bike.I am giving an 8/10 for Parallel monsters (yeah I know it is cheesy but I found it interesting) and 2/10 for Dante the great, 1/10 for Bonestorm and 2/10 for Vicious circles.

            "content": "V/H/S: Viral (2014) 1/2 (out of 4) The third film in the series has a loser seeking fame by constantly filming stuff hoping to capture something that will go viral and make him famous. During a police chase his girlfriend mysteriously disappears so he goes chasing an ice cream truck and we then flash to the anthology stories. In Dante the Great, a no-good magician finds a cloak that once belonged to Houdini and it gives him special powers. The only thing is that he has to feed it humans. Parallel Monsters has an inventor who makes a portal, which allows him to try out someone else's life. The third story, Bonestorm, has a group of skateboarders heading to Mexico for some fun only to run into a cult who needs their bodies.I was pleasantly surprised with the first two films in the series and thought they were a fun and gory way to bring back the anthology film. Sadly, this third entry is beyond awful and really ranks down there with some of the worst sequels to good movies that have ever been made. Not only is this movie a disappointing distant from the previous two but it really goes down as one of the worst horror movies in recent memory. I really don't know what went so wrong with this film but there's really not a single good thing that can be said about it and the only reason it avoids a BOMB rating is that there's one moment involving a dog that is so downright stupid that it actually made me laugh out loud.The rest of V/H/S: VIRAL is just downright awful and we can't start with the first film. The entire magician thing is just downright stupid and really doesn't fit in with the series as we're greeted to some interview footage with the magician and then we catch the rest of the story. There are countless problems here ranging from the awful acting to the downright horrendous CGI gore effects. Seriously, if this is the best you can do with the gore budget then perhaps you should wait until Halloween time and buy some of those $1 tubes of blood that Wal-Mart sells. It'll look more realistic. The second story is just downright awful, story-wise and contains the same awful gore from the first film. The third movie could have done something more with the material. I'm not sure if it was on purpose or not but the cult actually looks like the Templar knights from TOMBS OF THE BLIND DEAD. The gore here is a bit more realistic but the character are so annoying and the entire thing is so loud and obnoxious that it pains you to watch it.The entire wrap-around story is, I think, supposed to have some message to it but it's just too annoying for anything else. There's really nothing good that I can say about this film and even though it lasts just 81-minutes the thing feels twice as long with each minute just feeling like an eternity and it's quite painful to sit through this. I really had high expectations following the first two movies but I guess the good ideas ran out. This third film is about as bad as it gets.",

            "review_title": "A Mediocre Film.",
            "content": "The biggest problem with this film was its Wrap around segments they made No sense and they had no connection with the rest of the movie. The wrap around story is about a boy who lives with his girlfriend and he likes to film her a lot, I'm guessing he did that because he thought she was sexy,which she was but I just thought all of his filming was weird. The main event in the wrap around story is the police chasing an ice cream van and the guy wants to film the whole chase on camera. I don't understand why he would want to film that because I found it rather lame but to each their own I guess. story 1 Dante the great had a couple of cool moments but it was still a lame story. It was about a man who has this magic cloak and it allows him to do anything,so when he performs as an Illusionist people think what he's doing are just tricks but they are actually real.He doesn't just preform real magic on stage he also likes to kill people and I'm guessing he did it because he was sadistic. I have to say the dumbest thing about this story is his cloak eats people!. When I saw that I was like HUH? What the hell is that?.Also Dante was an idiot for filming his own murders,did he want to get caught or something?. The police could have found his tapes and he would go to jail for the murders. The best thing about this Stupid story was probably the scene where the police find Dante and they try to shoot him and he uses his magic to dodge the bullets and he kills a few of the police with some cool effects but that's about it. At the end of the story Dante fights with this women and she is able to cast a spell on him to make his cloak turn on him and eat him up?. I don't know how she did that because I thought only Dante could control the cloak. The girl tries to burn the cloak but later it comes back and I'm guessing it ate her?. The story was weird and this whole film was weird. Story 2 had some interesting ideas but I felt it fell flat by the end because it was too boring and long drawn out. It was about this man who builds this machine and it allows him to go to a parallel world that looks the same as his world which is obviously a Sci-Fi story. He meets himself and they make a deal and decide to change places and go to each others world. I admit the idea was interesting but the execution was poor. There are a lot of weird things in this story that did not need to be there like for instance the man goes into his parallel living room and finds his parallel wife there with two Men. there is a bag filled with blood hanging up in the room and its never explained what the bag is for. The people end up being Aliens the effects were decent but that's it. If I want to see a story about parallel worlds I will watch (Coherence) instead, that movie did this story better and its a better film.Story 3 was the only story I liked and ironically it's the one people hated the most but I thought it was entertaining,it was about this group of friends who go out skateboarding together and I liked these characters even though most people don't. People say they were douche bags but I disagree I thought they were just teenagers being teenagers they were messing around and having fun and that's what kids do. these characters cared about each other and they tried to help each other when they were in trouble. The teenagers are approached by this weird Mexican death cult and they try to kill the boys but these guys fight back and beat up and kill every one of these freaks which I thought was fun to watch. I liked the way the story was shot with the cameras on each guys helmet and I liked the Action. I'm surprised people don't like this story because it's definitely the most entertaining out of the three. The boys totally kick ass and take names and they help each other Fight and they totally annihilated the cult so in my opinion that makes this the Best story out of the three and it also ends good which the other two stories didn't. (I like good endings Sue Me.)We then get to the Ending wrap around which is a total mess and makes no sense and the viral story I never understood or liked and I never understood why the boy was so obsessed with a police chase for an ice cream van.the guy has obviously never watched a cop show on TV before. the boy finds the crashed van and it holds all this weird footage and his girlfriend was on a video and an invisible force was slamming her head against the wall repeatedly while she was laughing like a maniac. Why was that happening? I have No idea and I was too board to care. The film is never scary and I never cared about the boy or girl because I never knew anything about them and then we just have an ending that is over the top and ridiculous! With Stupid music playing in the background which does not fit the movie. It's a depressing Ending with triumphant music playing which makes no sense. I'm guessing the Ending meant everything went viral in the end?. To be honest I don't care and I never did care about that because it was Not interesting. This Film was Poor and I did not like it.",

I recently got to getting V/H/S: Viral and my friend and I love these movies so we were really excited to see this one. Sorry to say, but it was a huge disappointment... There were some very blunt parts, and some parts that seemed out of place. I also liked how in V/H/S 1 and 2 they were all from P.O.V Cameras. Or how it's also called, Shaky Cam. Everything is recorded from a personal camera making it seem more realistic. Some parts of this movie didn't have that. They were higher budget shots. I think they were going for a higher budget type movie to make it better but it made it worse. There are those Shaky cam parts but with it but not all like that, it didn't feel the same. I would hope that the Writers and Producers of this movie see all these reviews and decide to make V/H/S: Redemtion or V/H/S: Revival or something. A name of re-newel that stuck to the first two movies. I'm sorry to say, but If you're a fan of V/H/S, I wouldn't watch this. There are a couple decent parts, but nothing like the first two.",

The second was a little more ambitious in its style and the stories it offered but only one of them, maybe two, really worked for me. A big disappointment. What both had in common was that the overarching narrative throughout was weak in both, the act of people watching these tapes. This one certainly did something far more different, and although it takes up more time and at times seems more interesting, it's also super confusing as to how the tapes are being shown and what the hell is going on. If someone knows, please tell meAs for the segments, the cut I watched was missing one of them and it only had three, but like the sequel, it's becoming more ambitious and a lot more aware of its silliness. The first one, about an illusionist, has a really fantastic and totally fun climax. The second one was really trippy, and the third was decent but went on for way too long. I want to watch to see the fourth one that this cut was missing, but as this package is now, I think it's fun stuff. Nowhere near the greatness of the first (well, \"greatness\" in any of these films is stretching it) but a step up from the sequel.",

Before I start this review I have seen the other V/H/S movies and to me I thought those films was actually really shocking but still fun to watch, and when I heard this movie was coming out I was looking forward to it, and the trailers got me excited for the film, and after seeing the film... am a bit disappointing. This is a found footage movie and you know the camera is going to be all over the place, but in this movie the camera moved around so much that I couldn't see a damn thing and that annoyed me so much, because in the other V/H/S movies the camera did move around a lot, but not to the point where it annoyed me. And the movie is not scary at all or even shocking. But the only good thing in this movie that stopped me from giving this movie 1/4, is the skateboard scene with the hooded skeletons attacking the skateboarder's, and why I like that scene is because it comes out of nowhere and that's what made the other movies so fun. Overall I was really disappointing with this film. It's the worst, but it's not good.",

The stories weren't strong at all and nothing really works. The effects used for the magician story were okay but the story went from here to there and back and what was it all about, I can't tell. The second entry was also a bit strange and suddenly we do see alien genitals attacking people. Weird but it didn't work at all. maybe the last entry did deliver a bit of nasty and bloody moments but still it couldn't stand up against the stories from previous entries on part 1 and 2.

            "content": "\"V/H/S: Viral\" marks the third film in the horror anthology franchise in three years, a franchise which has found itself circulating in a limited theatrical release and video-on-demand outlets, giving independent directors a method of experimentation that allows for readily-available distribution and a showcase for a variety of talents. The last two \"V/H/S\" installments were nothing incredible, and shared the commonality of having a shaky (speaking in terms of narrative and videography) wraparound story but found ways to compile four or five well-executed short horror stories into something worth watching.The genre's third entry is where it starts to show that maybe an annual tradition for this franchise may not be the best thing for it. \"V/H/S: Viral\" is a messy, scattershot hodge-podge of a horror anthology, with the most disorganized editing the franchise has yet to see. It wasn't atypical for at least one of the shorts in the prior installments to be burdened by shaky videography, but when the wraparound story (the metaphorical glue holding this anthology together) and another one of the stories are brought down so heavily by their lackluster videography, and the two additional shorts are somewhat effective yet light, is when you have a third installment that feels nothing but a rushed entry into a franchise that's already something of a roller-coaster.To begin with, the wraparound story, Marcel Sarmiento's \"Vicious Circles,\" by far the most incoherent wraparound story of the three films, focuses on a man so obsessed with catching a big event on camera so the video can go viral he becomes neglectful of his girlfriend's feelings. When he tries to catch a high-speed police- chase in the act, the video ends up backfiring when he learns the true, captive abilities of the vehicle being pursued. Or something like that. Amidst awful videography and chaotic editing lies a solid commentary about the obsession of \"the next big thing\" and the need to record everything that happens. It's unfortunate to see such a bold opportunity brought down so heavily by its structural incoherence.Gregg Bishop's \"Dante the Great\" is the first official short we see in its entirety, concerning a cocky magician, whose career experiences a meteoric rise after he finds a cloak that once belonged to Harry Houdini. The cloak possesses the ability to bring illusions to life, allowing Dante the Great to propel people into mid-air and transport them to different places before their eyes. The short manages to be the most fun \"V/H/S: Viral\" has to offer, even if it's all a little too predictable, and features some of the strongest (and most visible) effects work of the film.Nacho Vigalondo's \"Parallel Monsters\" is next, a short entirely in Spanish, concerning interdimensional mayhem as an inventor creates access to an alternate universe through which he finds another version of himself. Everything in his doppelganger's world looks the same, so the two agree to swap worlds for fifteen minutes, until the inventor makes the mistake of realizing that sex is a much different activity in the other world. Out of all the things you could do to manipulate in another, almost identical dimension, the fact that sex was chosen seems too juvenile and too bent on shock. Still, \"Parallel Monsters\" has a low-quality approach with its videography, despite depicting futuristic technology, which makes for an interesting contrast and a marginally-satisfying short.We conclude with Justin Benson and Aaron Scott Moorhead's \"Bonestorm,\" concerning a group of Los Angeles skateboarders, making good use of multiple cameras and camera-angles to capture their stunts. Shot mostly through the use of first-person perspectives on skateboards, or through the use of strategically-placed helmet- cameras, the gang heads down to Mexico for a bit more unrestricted skating to find a Mexican cult made up entirely of violent skeletons, who have made their home over a land infused with a pentagram logo on the ground. This short, again, is burdened by shaky, monotonously unstable videography, and suffers from redundancy when the skateboarders finally figure out the violent ways of this newfound cult.Another short film by the name of \"Gorgeous Vortex,\" directed by Todd Lincoln, was planned to be included with \"V/H/S: Viral,\" but was cut for unknown reasons and was neither screened at festivals nor released on video-on-demand outlets. Because of this, \"V/H/S: Viral\" runs at a curiously short eighty-one-minutes, and results in a film being digested almost as quickly as it ends. While neither short is entirely abysmal, none of them particularly stand out, with the highlight, \"Dante the Great,\" only an average affair instead of one deserving extensive praise. With this, the \"V/H/S\" franchise has already established its value, which I stated above, but if \"Viral\" turns out not to be the conclusion of the franchise as a whole, the future will need to see more quality control for the franchise to remain admirable.",

            "content": "Number three of this anthology franchise, and as usual its a mixed bag from beginning to end, but for once, its the wrap around story that is the weak link of the film.It follows a couple who are filming an ice cream van chase, because they want to be famous, but then she gets kidnapped, and the van isn't all what it seems. Very bizarre, and very confusing.But then the stories start, and we are treated to the good, the okay, and the blooming most bizarre thing I've seen in a while.One segment is about an unemployed Wannabe magician, who finds a cloak that supposedly belonged to Houdini, and gives him the most wonderful powers imaginable, or if you can't be bothered to stretch your imagination, go and see Chronicle, its basically the same.Nevertheless he becomes power hungry, starts to kill people, and becomes more and more psychotic. Not a bad story at all.One segment is just trippy beyond belief. It features a man who has discovered a Parallel universe, befriends himself and they swap for a while. But things go awry. His wife is in to some sort of weird ritual, and there are men with demonic members. Utterly baffling, but not without merit.The next section was my favourite, not because of its narrative or story, but because it was a fun segment. Here we get a gang of sk8ter bois, who are filming themselves doing all kind of tricks on there skateboards, only to be confronted by a quiet mexiqueen, and soon lots of people in make up who like to be hit by skateboards.It's lively, well filmed, and fun.The film isn't particularly well acted, and the effects are not the best, but it's made for Halloween, and it's not to be taken seriously, but next time, make the wrap around story a little more interesting.",

            "content": "The more I read other people's reviews on sites such as this, the more I realize how unique each and every person's tastes can be. I, very often, find that my impression of a movie differs greatly from a lot of people who frequent these sites and that's okay. I simply can't understand such outright hatred of this movie, though. I have reviewed all three in the series here and you'll see that I'm not a blind worshipper, at all. I find the first movie to be bland and somewhat clich\u00e9, though many loved it. I found the second movie in the series to be one of the best horror films in the last decade. While I don't think the VIRAL is as good as the 2nd movie, it's certainly not the disastrous drop in quality that many feel it is.Yes, there are weaknesses in the movie that I'll admit to freely. The acting and dialog can be pretty weak at times, especially in the first segment, but that's nothing new to this series and absolutely nothing new to indie horror. Many seem to be really put off by the loss of that central concept of these stories being bootleg VHS tapes that did indeed give the separate stories a coherent feel. They seem to have abandoned that idea here and it does make the movie feel a lot more like a collection of shorts than being connected stories.The actual stories given to us, though, are really just as good as most in the VHS canon. That is, with the glaring exception of the wraparound story VISCOUS CIRCLES. It is a giant freaking mess that makes no sense and doesn't even come close to bringing the movie to a satisfying conclusion. In all honesty, though, the interlocking segments have always been the weakest part of this series, right?The first real segment is DANTE THE GREAT. Any pop culture geek is going to be very familiar with this played out storyline of a stage magician that gains real magical power, a concept done repeatedly in comics and TV. The acting, as mentioned before, is pretty bad in this one, which stands out more because the segments wants to look and feel professional quality, but that acting holds it down. What saves this, though, is some pretty amazing special effects, which are just as good as some of the powers seen in Marvel's movies, honestly.The second segment by rising star director, Nacho Vigalondo, is the now requisite foreign segment featuring two very similar men meeting from two different dimensions. The payout of the segment is that the men are, naturally, not quite as similar as they first appeared to be. It gets more than a little odd at times but reminds me of some sort of twisted amalgamation of Cronenberg directing THEY LIVE, produced by Troma. It's not bad, but easily forgettable.The last segment, BONESTORM, seems to be the one causing the most revulsion in the viewing audience, essentially an editing combination of GoPro footage of typical skateboarding kids trying to survive an attack of some sort of occult zombies. I absolutely loved it. I am a giant fan of De Ossorio's classic TOMBS OF THE BLIND DEAD and this seemed to me to be a perfect modern homage to those movies. I'll have to give it a a second viewing, but I could swear I even heard that director's name mentioned by the helicopter pilot, though it's not English at that point, so I can't be entirely sure. I loved Benson & Moorehead's prior film RESOLUTION and this gives me a lot of hope that they have great things in the future.'In the end, I found this movie to be no different than the rest of the series, or from any horror anthology ever produced, as matter of fact. Some segments are good and some segments are bad and the audience is generally left with a mixed feeling caused by that disparity between tones and themes and qualities, but it's by no means a one-star movie, people. Go watch something like POULTRYGEIST and then come back and tell me this is one of the worst horror movies ever made.",

            "content": "\"Dante the Redneck Magician\" plays out like a stereotypical horror sci-fi story from 50s comic-books such as \"Astounding Stories\" and \"Creepy Worlds\". It's like simplistic pulp fiction peppered with CGI to make it more glitzy. But I prefer a good, cheesy 50s comic-book version any day over this. Not a bad story but kind of dumb, especially Dante's immunity to bullets, or his utter stupidity in killing only women that know him personally. The ridiculous-looking male lead seems to be very badly cast. They should have picked a proper redneck actor. The girl is great though. 5/10\"Alfonso In Satanland\" has a great premise, worthy of not one but several movies, or a whole TV series. This short story doesn't do this idea justice, not because it's bad - it's quite good actually - but because there is a lot more potential in this than just alien-genital porn. (The metal band GWAR must have been an influence?) The conclusion is problematic: evil Alfonso says \"oh Jesus\" which is illogical considering he comes from a satanic universe. But this is a minor complaint. Much dumber though is the fact that good Alfonso goes back to the evil room/world: this makes ZERO sense. His natural reaction would have been to drag the wounded evil Alfonso back through the door, then seal the gateway and destroy the machine. He had just barely escaped that world, yet waltzes right back in: wut? I guess the writer/director couldn't figure out an elegant way to have both Alfonsos killed by Martas so he resorted to an absurd hence terrible plot-device.Still, a rather bizarre and well played out story. Very clever, the simple way in which the director tells us about the key difference between the two worlds: simply by showing respective photos hanging on the wall. I also very much enjoyed the ensuing details/hints about evil Alfonso's world being deviant. The sexual stuff however was perhaps unnecessary. But hey, a Spanish film-maker wrote this; Spanish cinema has been inundated with perversion ever since they got rid of Franco. They can't seem to get enough of it. If it isn't cannibalism then it's alien genitalia and devious sexual situations.I find it comical that the parallel world is demonic, in the sense of it supposedly being the opposite of ours - which is as far as I can tell a rather Satanic world itself. 8/10\"Skaters vs Cultists\" is plain moronic fun. It plays out like a dumb video game, but there is a certain strangeness in pitting half-witted skaters against a mysterious, dark cult in some remote area in the outskirts of a city. The only thing that bothers me is that the skaters aren't shocked enough; their reactions don't match the events. Whether this is due to the amateur actors (who are presumably pro skaters) or whether it's intentional, I have no clue. Obviously, this primitive premise would never work as a feature film, only as a vignette. Speaking of which, check out the feature films of this directing/writing duo. (Not the skaters, I mean the writers/directors.) Highly recommended. 7/10\"Latino Gangster Goes Amok\" is a very short one, more part of the ice-cream truck story. It's unconvincing because the gangsters come off as completely inauthentic. Especially the actor playing the gang boss has no credibility at all. He looks as if he'd just graduated from acting school i.e. the polar opposite of a Mexican gangster. 2/10\"Porn Sleazoid\" is another very brief one. Could have been expanded to something longer and more meaningful, but serves as just a brief distraction from the ice-cream truck story which it is a part of. 6/10\"The Obligatory But This Time Confusing In-Between VHS Story About An Ice-Cream Truck\" is fairly bizarre. I don't mind its cryptic, undecipherable nature and conclusion, but perhaps it would have worked better if played in its entirety in one go, without constant interruption. This \"central\" story, if we can call it that, is possibly what was the most annoying to people who were disappointed with this 3rd entry. 7/10I find this baffling though, because not only is this 3rd installment not the weakest, it is better than the first movie, and about as good as the second one. What these people (i.e. confused fans of pseudo-snuff) were expecting from the 3rd part, I do not know. Perhaps they forgot what the franchise is about? Having inconclusive endings is NORMAL in these movies, ditto the chaotic editing and distorted images. My theory is that most people got bored with this shtick, but didn't realize it yet, hence blamed the movie for failing their expectations when it is they who failed to recognize what it is they really wanted. They didn't want another VHS movie, basically. They wanted a standard, polished horror film that spells everything out. Or a snuff film with excessive gore. It's so hard to please confused blood-thirsty millennials these days...",

            "content": "While a viral virus outbreak seems to be spreading across the internet superhighway, as the film follows a teenage young man biking through a city searching for his love who seems to have been kidnapped in an ice cream van (that has seen better days), we are privy to a series of recorded episodes where characters face incredible, supernatural events.The first tale doesn't follow the found footage format religiously as the fourth wall of the popular subgenre is broken as pieces of it are shot by a \"cinematic camera\". It involves a trailer park magician-wannabe named Dante (Justin Welborn) who finds a demonic black cape (supposedly discarded by a frightened Houdini!) and exploits what it can do for great success. He records his cape's magic tricks and what the cape allows him to do with his hands and mind when wearing it. However, the cape is a carnivore (I can't make this stuff up!) and demands human nourishment (!) in order for Dante to be given access to perform with its magic. So a number of magician assistants wind up missing, and Dante records (why?) the process of the cape's feeding from them! In found footage, the obviousness of recording events which defy common sense, reeking of implausibility, finds its way into another example of the genre. You just kind of have to accept that what we mostly *wouldn't* record will be in order for us to experience what the characters do. This tale is a special effects showcase where the cape does some amazing things. Arial stunt work (climbing walls, the cape teleporting a person from one place to another and a rabbit from one place to another), bodies of a police task force suffering crushed bones without actually being touched by Dante, a rabbit being split open by Dante with him just moving hands right above it, the cape \"eating\" victims, and Dante performing fireball maneuvers that develop and fly from just his hands and mind making them appear; the tale has plenty of effects work to dazzle. The stunning red head, Emmy Argo, is the assistant who might just get the upper hand on Dante due to how much he likes her. Her boyfriend's fate is particularly ghoulish. Irony of the cape's feeding habits doesn't stop at just Dante's victims\u0085he had better watch out as well! The second tale deals with parallel alternate universes *meeting* as two scientist Alfonsos (Gustavo Salmer\u00f3n) discover each other after building successful dimensional machines in their basements. Exhilarated by their mutual encounter, the two Alfonsos decide to cross over into each other's worlds for a fifteen minute visit. One of the Alfonsos realizes that the alternate universe he crossed over into isn't necessarily to his liking\u0085it seems the people in this universe are a bit biologically different (that is an understatement!). The horrifying addition to this is the alternate Alfonso has a particularly unique penile difference from his counterpart which might have bit of an overbite! Alfonso's alternate wife, Marta (Marian \u00c1lvarez), might just also have a biological, anatomical overbite all her own! Just its premise is creepy and unsettling enough to leave quite a Cronenbergian impression hard to forget (even if you *want* to unsee it!). The creation of the basement teleport machines certainly cause more harm than good to their creators! The third tale features skateboarders traveling to Tijuana for the ultimate experience, but the perfect location to vert presents more than they bargained for: true Mexican occultists in Day of the Dead skull makeup and attire arrive to attack them! An arm pulled from one of the boarders causes blood to leak on this chalk symbol which seems to awaken something evil. Eventually the occultists who die at the hands of the boarders awaken as ghouls! Even a monster seems to emerge thanks to the black magic that responds to the blood of the boarders! Mostly seen through the cameras hooked onto the helmets, with one boarder shooting from a hand-held, this features gruesome violence from skateboards, animal bones, and even a sword! The most virtuoso and exciting use of the POV approach of found footage. The stoner characters aren't exactly ingratiating, but they sure defend themselves well (well, two of them do!).Other found footage additions include a woman whose nude recording was posted on a website getting revenge on the blogger in a taxi and a Spanish harlem gangster soir\u00e9e erupting into chaos when the lead hood gets enraged by the fork-stabbing of his pet dog! The wraparound story isn't anything to write home about. It has a young man chasing after a van (a van dragging a biker across a paved road is nuts!), eventually finding it with no one inside, perhaps left with a decision to make which could affect the entire city, maybe even the world!",

It consists of a magician with a magic cape that consumes humans, similar to what the VHS tape would do. There is a group of skate boarders who get in trouble with Mexican zombies. A man creates a portal to a parallel universe and trades places with himself.

            "content": "I watched this movie at the Lisbon Horror Movie Festival (MotelX); when I did, I hadn't watched any of the previous ones (now I have), so I did't really know what I was going to see, and I quite enjoyed the experience.As its predecessors, V/H/S Viral is formed by three found-footage stories, tied together by yet a fourth frame story, also filmed in a found-footage fashion. (Apparently there was supposed to be one more segment, directed by Todd Lincoln, but it was never filmed or it didn't make the final cut).The frame story, \"Vicious Circles\" by Marcel Sarmiento, is quite unsettling. It starts with a police car chase of an ice-cream van, and a young couple much in love who is split by the intrusion of pure horror in the form of viral videos that appear in their mobile phones. This story is split in four small segments, some very brief, others much longer, until the final scene which closes the circle, so to speak. It was in general quite enjoyable, with some concessions to gore, a few clich\u00e9s flowing around and some very enjoyable scenes. The use of music in the very last segment (Beethoven's 9th symphony) was very clever, in my opinion. My score for this story, 7,5/10.The second story (first of the viral videos), filmed by Gregg Bishop, is more a mockumentary than a found-footage, although it obviously includes many \"interviews\" and closed-circuit camera footage. It tells the story of \"Dante the Great\", who always dreamed of being a magician and got to do so when he discovered a mysterious cape: a cape that was so powerful that apparently it frightened Houdini himself. This story is the least gore of all the pack, and it is in a way quite predictable, but it is well executed. The main sin for me is that at one point the movie abandons the \"found-footage\" form and includes some scenes with a more traditional filming; and that is hard to accept in a movie that is precisely about videotapes being found. Score: 6/10.\"Parallel Monsters\", by Nacho Vigalondo, is probably the best of them all. It is filmed in Spanish and has a slightly different look, more professional, more acted, less realistic in a way. It tells the story of a scientist who opens a gate to another parallel universe, only to find that in that universe there is another version of himself, who has built exactly the same machine. When they decide to exchange universes for 15 minutes, he will discover that there are in fact a few, ahem, minor differences between their universes. This segment is quite original, very funny, very cruel; it explores its premise with intelligence and leaves quite a few things unexplained (which is not a bad thing at all). The only thing that disappointed me a bit was that the development of the story turns to more conventional horror clich\u00e9s. In any case, I am giving it a 9/10.\"Bonestorm\", by Justin Benson & Aaron Moorhead, follows a group of teenage American skaters who decide to go to Tijuana to explore an abandoned skating park and film some videos. When they get there, they get haunted by a death-worshiping cult (or something similar) who used that skate park as their ceremonial ground. The premise is extremely simple, and apart from a few scares and gore scenes you won't get much out of it. The best part is the humor in the creation of the characters. Score: 7/10.All in all, I enjoyed the experience. The segments are obviously uneven, but I guess that's inevitable in a collective movie. Nacho Vigalondo's segment is one level above the rest, followed by the frame story by Marcel Sarmiento. After watching the three films of the trilogy, I think it was a good idea to abandon the \"damned videotape\" idea and update it in a form of viral videos, which allows for a different kind of frame story.Oh, and I think the movie is trying to tell us something about our urge to be famous at any cost and by any means, but quite sincerely, I don't think anyone who sees this movie will really care about that.Overall score: 7/10",

I like the fun of the special effects. It's like a fun little Twilight Zone episode. I like another section where it's skateboarders vs. Demons. It's a silly premise and it's fun.

My favorite parts were the magicians fighting over a teleporting cape, and the skateboarders. I think a lot of people hated the skateboarding segment, but I loved how it just said 'screw it' to conventional filmmaking ideas and managed to establish something that was really like an actual found-footage thing with these guys being stalked by a bunch of weirdos who might not be just wearing costumes. The 'portal door' segment is pretty shocking. I'm amazed that there are SO many bad reviews for this film; I think it just hasn't found its audience, because those who would enjoy it probably didn't like the first two films all that much.If you're looking for something crazy, dark and funny, and you're ok with films which are as much about the bizarre experience as the narrative (like if you enjoyed 'Mother' with Jennifer Lawrence), try VHS Viral.",

            "content": "This movie is by no means a great one. All the negative or positive views towards it are in opinion accurate in how each viewer perceived it. For me it was just the same as if I had been given a smelly joint, finding myself wondering if it was going to make me happy or have that bad trip. I should have been in the right frame of mind while watching this and so should my close friend who throughout the film grew more uncomfortable to the point of feeling on the edge of a panic attack. Because of her reactions and through the films uneasy voyeuristic exploration I also felt occasionally panicked and somewhat detached from my comfort zone. Interestingly I managed to hold myself together until close to the end by which time I couldn't deal with it and switched it off, not because it was a bad movie. I know people will be laughing at reading this and I would be as well so let me delve deeper. I have watched many horror films and i used to constantly be on the lookout for that experience that will disturb and frighten me. All those video nasties and banned 70's films all used to have an interesting effect, that I would always feel somewhat detached from because of a strange kind of fun unreality experience. Then for the first time many years ago now I watched the first Final Destination film that introduced me a new kind of philosophy horror, that put me in the strange position of having to endure an intense empathy and deep confrontation with my deep subconscious fear of death. I still remember having to go through and imagine death and all the sensations that came with it. A few months ago I watched a thriller about a person that had to go through life with memory loss and again I couldn't help but imagine some deep stuff causing me to feel very uncomfortable. Well tonight for me it was there again for few reasons. 1) Firstly I knew what this film was doing, it was amplifying many of today's internet monsters. Our access to knowledge and information, the way we have the ability through technology to watch horrors unfold while we sit down safe, social narcissism where by people crave to be seen by so many online, sexual perversions, daring extreme entertainment that causes us to feel more alive than our simple lives can provide, different mentalities from how we used to be and many more unusual insanities that our current technological society has given birth to. From a deep perspective this films an ultimate fear because its been conceptualised deliberately to push our buttons.2) Not everyone goes delves near heavy scientific subject matter. Within one of the films stories lies a very frightening prospect that many theories are based around. Some years ago there was a series on television called Sliders that explored certain quantum concepts. The main one was about infinite parallel universes's or dimensions. Matter, energy, atoms all being surrounded by infinite alternatives. Family guy as also explored this idea in a fun enjoyable way but then there's this film. It decided to put us in the position of having broken certain physical rules or the rules of physics allowing us to walk through into a mirrored dimension that actually isn't a perfect symmetry. I won't spoil it but will say it hit me hard because at times life can offer illusions of light that can turn dark or less poetically an imaginary voyage into a much darker place, alien or demonic realm, perhaps both.3) After the previous bad trip that i kind of enjoyed in a thank goodness I got through it kind of way, I again found myself facing another bad trip. This time it seemed to induce a kind of nauseating paranoia because again I'm facing dark subject matter now exploring the idea that some kind of external technological device could induce madness or abnormal behaviour. I didn't feel comfortable again which was a sign to me that I was being psychologically attacked by deep subject matter. I know many viewers of this film won't be looking into it like I did and yes I wasn't high on any drugs. I am totally against going near anything that causes me to think differently and lose control of my mind. This film was a trip because without wanting to, I started to think about it and once that happened well I became somewhat uncomfortable. Kudos to the makers of this film for challenging my mind. Overall the film was presented in that common found footage shaky cam style way and the V.H.S effects were perhaps a little over done, even getting close to obnoxious at times. The edit could have been a little bit more diverse in transition and less harsh on the eyes. Some parts were also heavily saturated and grungy making me feel somewhat disorientated and overloaded. All was slightly rushed because to make it look amateur and viral with good effect. Can't really comment on the acting due to not really needing to build a deeper relationship with the characters. This film delivers us an horror pill that hits a nerve.If your not a deep over thinking person your lucky, because it will probably be just like all the other horror films you have seen before full of twilight zone stories. If like me you wander deeply into films fully emerging yourself into it, then this can quite easily be that ultimate horror experience. Personally I hope they do more of these films and i think the rating will go up a bit in time.RatingsCinematography 5.5, average really Concept 7.5 interesting but disorienting Fear Factor 8 due to being out of the box Acting NA due to not really needing to analyse it",

Granted, any idiot with a bad quality camera (and there are plenty of both) can release more trash to the world, and so the genre is full of rubbish, although, let's be honest, movies with ridiculous high budgets are also trash, mostly. Anyway, I've followed the VHS series and the franchise just gets worse with every new movie. The first VHS back in 2012 was some sort of new concept, and it was somehow interesting. The second followed the same guidelines, although it was worse than its predecessor, in all aspects. Some stories were laughable and the CGI was going down. Viral is just too bad. The acting is poor beyond words, particularly in the first/main plot (that girl, Iris, jeeeesus. Go back to acting school, will ya?), the CGI is shareware quality and the story is way too stupid. Likewise, the magician part is a show of (bad) amateur acting and it fails in the same points as the main one, basically. I'd say that the Spanish part is actually not bad, original and interesting enough, plus the acting is OK (in all fairness, both the actress and actor worked in a good few movies before). This Spanish section is the only reason why this is getting 2 stars rather than 1. Still, it doesn't redeem the rest of Viral; it'd have been better off as a separate short movie rather than being included here. The skaters' story is not 100% bad, but it is too long for its repetitiveness and the boys are annoying. The rest of the movie is pure garbage.This is not even found footage anymore. That feeling is all but gone, even when they follow the \"homemade\" concept in most of the movie.Another particularity is that, even though the sexual innuendo is still present, it has been dramatically reduced and, contrary to the nudity festival that were the previous films, there're no really breasts, vaginas or penises in the movie. Not saying that this is bad, or good, simply stating a fact.Overall, a completely missable movie, even if you liked the previous ones.Oh, and using Beethoven's 9th Symphony doesn't make it any better.",

For one, the wraparound segment is not very interesting, very repetitive, and overlong. That's not to say the first 2 had great wraparounds, but they were at least interesting in their own way.This one only has three other segments, and they range from decent to weird. I found them to be fairly interesting but they didn't seem to reach their full potential. The first, Dante the Great, was the best of the bunch and without it I would have rated this movie lower.The second I found pretty interesting but it wasn't fleshed out enough and could have been a bit longer. The third was a bit of fun and I enjoyed it but again I didn't feel that it reached its potential and could have done more.The movie could have benefited from a fourth segment and a shorter wraparound, and I don't feel the quality matched that from the first 2 movies, which had much stronger segments",

This is not the best movie you could watch but also it is not the worst.

But, I can't let that get in the way of how bad some parts were. ESPECIALLY the wrap around segment. There were only 2 segments I enjoyed. One was Bonestorm and the other was Parallel Monsters. Dante the Great had some great visual effects, but the problem was, it wasn't a found footage movie. Plus, the fact that there was a demon hiding in his cloak ALMOST made me turn off my computer. But, being me, I continued watching. The wrap around segment used screenshots from the first movie, which I thought was a nice throwback and almost made me excited because, maybe I could get some closure or an understanding of what was going on in the first 2 movies. But unfortunately, the film didn't. The \"Gorgeous Vortex\" segment was removed as well, despite it being in the trailers. So that's another downside. The film looks OK, it has some nice effects, but it lacks the soul of a VHS movie. I'm giving this one a VERY generous 5/10 stars. It would have been 3, but I have a soft spot for it since it bears the title of VHS.",

            "content": "V/H/S: Viral is a departure from the previous entries. We don't get the usual goofs looking through old VHS tapes. However the story that frames the movie (\"Vicious Circles\") doesn't make much sense. It involves a young couple. The guy decides to film everything, mainly his pretty girlfriend. When one of those LA car chases takes place in his neighborhood he sees his chance to film it and upload it so it'll go viral. Off he goes on his bike with cameras attached to his helmet. The chase follows a creepy old ice cream van that runs over people. For some reason the guy's cell phone mysteriously shows videos of his girl. Suddenly she appears on the street and vanishes as the van drives by.Then we move to the first independent segment--\"Dante the Great.\" One day Dante discovers a cape which has powers. It's like it is a portal to a different dimension. So he starts doing magic with it and becomes famous. But the cops are on his tail because his assistants keep disappearing. It turns out the cape demands blood. But his new assistant has plans of her own.We go back to \"Vicious Circles\" for some more bike riding after the van/girl. Someone in the back of the van grabs another biker who gets dragged to pieces.\"Parallel Monsters\" is about a Spanish guy who invents some large machine. When he turns it on and opens the door, it looks like on the other side is his mirror image. Another guy who looks just like him, holding a camera, and amazed at the machine. But it's not a mirror image. It's a parallel but inverted universe. They decide to go through the portal for every guy to explore the other guy's life. Their homes are identical except for a photo on a wall. One guy has a picture of him and his wife, the other a picture of a pentagram and candles. The first guy meets the other guy's hot wife. Apparently they were about to do something. In the middle of the living room is some bloody bag and two guys in underwear show up. When they ask the guy to go ahead and be the first, he hesitates so the other guys leave. The wife insists puzzled, so he leaves and runs into the two guys outside who go after him and suddenly their heads turn to light and develop creepy voices. When they take off their underwear it isn't pretty. Meanwhile guy #2 goes to the bedroom to see the other guy's wife who's sleeping, he too has something in his pants. Eventually they cross the portals again, but the first guy's wife isn't happy.The next segment \"Bonestorm\" features a bunch of dumb dope-head skaters who decide to drive to Tijuana. They buy firecrackers and as they walk/skate trough some riverbed run into some strange girl, see a corpse, an altar, a pentagram. The skate all over that stuff. Then one guy falls and bleeds over the pentagram. Now guys in hoods and corpsepaint appear and chant and slowly attack the kids who defend themselves with a gun, their skateboards, and the firecrackers, but the hooded guys buy now have turned into skeletons and still go after them.In the end the kid on the bike catches up with the van that has stopped. He gets inside and there are countless old TV sets. Suddenly his girl appears on screen and asks him to upload his videos. He declines so she starts hurting herself until he agrees.I didn't get to see \"Gorgeous Vortex\" that is included on DVD. Unfortunately this movie is not coherent enough. \"Vicious Circles\" doesn't amount to anything. Which is surprising given that Sarmiento has done some great things in the past. \"Dante the Great\" is a great story. Very entertaining and unique.\"Parallel Monsters\" had a lot of promise but something doesn't satisfy. I don't know why they had to film this in Spain. It's still a good segment though.\"Bonestorm\" is hampered by some real nasty characters that you can't care for. And it's also poorly filmed with cameras attached to the kids' helmets--pointing at their faces for some reason and that makes up most of the footage.I don't know if Gorgeous Vortex would have improved things. As it is, the arrangement of the stories doesn't help. Had they started with Dante and ended with Parallel perhaps I would have a better perception of VHS: Viral. But the ending as it is doesn't leave you with a good impression. At least we get sharp images and only a bit of unnecessary greenvision. I don't see a need for a further entry to the series.",

            "content": "Back in 2012, a new horror anthology graced the big and small screens and gave us new horror filmmakers, great stories, and scared the living daylights out of us. That anthology was called 'V/H/S', named after the popular home video format from the 80s and early 90s and consisted of 4 different short films with a 5th overall wrap- around movie to tie everything together. Each segment is directed by someone different in the horror genre and every filmmaker's unique stamp is imprinted in their own portion.Since the first 'V/H/S' was so successful and became an instant cult hit, the following year, they made 'V/H/S 2', which followed the same formula and was even better than the first go around. Now in 2014, we have the third installment and possibly the final film called 'V/H/S 3: Viral'. This time around, there are only three segments with a wrap around storyline, and instead of the whole VHS angle, this is more about things being filmed with a mobile phone and being uploaded to the internet, hence the 'Viral' aspect.The wrap around story is quite cool and features a a young couple watching a live police chase happening in their neighborhood. Once they see it coming down their street, they boyfriend uses his mobile phone to record the police chase in hopes that it goes viral online. That brings us to our first segment called 'Dante The Great', directed by Gregg Bishop (Dance of the Dead), which tells the story of a famous magician and the mysterious murders and disappearances of his female assistants. Dante (Justin Welborn) comes across a cloak, which is said to belong to the great Harry Houdini. Once he has the cloak, he is able to pull off any illusion with great ease, but there is something sinister about the cloak that might be the key to all these murders. This segment had both the found footage aspect as well as a straight narrative, but the special effects were pretty amazing, and Welborn did a great job as a sadistic and mad magician.The second segment was by far my favorite and was directed by the legendary Nacho Vigalondo (Time Crimes). His segment is called 'Parallel Monsters' and was the right amount of screwed up and scary that he can make a feature length movie out of this. This short starts off with an inventor who builds a machine in his basement that connects him to a parallel universe. Once this is open, he sees the mirror image of himself and his house. The two dopplegangers are friendly and are equally excited about this invention. They both decide to take 15 minutes to cross over into each other's universe and explore the similarities and differences. But once they do, we see that there are more things that are different than the same as we see bags dripping with blood and guts hanging around the house, blood orgies, sirens, and a satanic cult presence everywhere. And just when you think you've seen it all, Nacho adds a level of horror and shock that would make the Japanese horror film genre beg for mercy. It's quite amazing.And the last segment is called 'Bonestorm' and is directed by Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead(Spring). This piece is all sorts of fun and the premise is very simple. We meet a few jerk-off skateboarders who are trying to make their 'sponsor' video by pulling obnoxious pranks and skateboarding on city property. The four skateboarders head to Tijuana, Mexico to film their last scene in their video when a satanic and supernatural demon cult shows up and starts attacking them. Then this film turns into a video game like simulation as the skateboarders in first person mode use their skateboards, ninja swords, and anything else they can get their hands on to kill these demons from hell. It will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire battle.I really hope that this isn't the last film in the 'V/H/S' series, because if it is, I feel like it would have went out with a whimper rather than a bang. That being said, this third installment still has some fantastic moments that is guaranteed to thrill you, chill you, and fulfill you.",

Well, that is spot on here because V/H/S: Viral has got to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. V/H/S was good. It wasn't fantastic, but it was decent with quite a good few creepy moments in it. Unfortunately V/H/S 2 was the complete opposite, as was this. I honestly do not know what was worse...the horrible direction, the ridiculously over-used VHS static & interference, the nonsensical camera angles, or the sheer stupidity of the story's - and believe me...they DO get stupid.This one follows the same kind of style as the previous films...the main wrap-around story that has been interwoven with other shorter stories (thankfully only 3) throughout. Each one of the story's, including the main one, end up being just as bad as each other though, even if they do all start off OK. Parallel Monsters and Bonestorm start off the best out of the bunch, but they still both descend into utter stupidity.The sad thing is, the actual ideas for each of the shorter segments were good but for some inexplicable reason, the makers seemed to opt for a path of stupidity rather than put a bit of thought into them to make them decent.The camera angles for the most part were ludicrous as well, especially for Vicious Circles because it's amazing how we could get a POV from the main guy's bike when he's not even wearing a cam. And how we see the exact same sort of interference we got with old VHS tapes (which was WAY over-used) when it was digital cameras & smartphones that were being used throughout I'll never know.The only thing this movie has got going for it are some of the special effects (except for the very obvious hand puppets that were used towards the end of Parallel Monsters) and some of them will make you flinch...the bare feet on the concrete for one.This is definitely a movie to avoid.",

This short wasn't engaging and it didn't feel interesting or disturbing enough. It felt weirdly like a superhero film and just came off as silly. The documentary style footage did look real, but other than this the effects and visuals just looked really cheap. There weren't any real scared apart from a very cheesy jumpscare at the end.Parallel Monsters follows an inventor as he creates an interdimensional portal and switches places with the copy of himself. This was the best short in the film, but was still underwhelming. There was a strong sense of mystery and I was eager to see where it was going, but it ended up being anticlimactic and laughably ridiculous. Once again the effects looked bad and it just wasn't scary at all.Bonestorm follows a group of skateboarders who encounter something evil while filming various stunts. This short was just plain boring and there wasn't much to it, yet it still went on for too long. The acting wasn't great and the dialogue was incredibly cringeworthy, not to mention the effects also looked poor.The frame narrative, Vicious Circles, follows a man who gradually gets more and more obsessed with filming viral videos. I really struggled to understand how this linked the shorts together and by the end I was still at a loss.

            "content": "It is a safe assumption to say that the V/H/S films have become modern day cult classics for horror fans, particularly those with a taste for found-footage. Viral is now the third installation in the VHS anthology series, during which characters have been known to watch horrific, violent, and supernatural events that have been previously recorded.In a nutshell, the previous V/H/S installments have all borrowed concepts common in the horror genre and added their own abhorrence and originality to the stories being portrayed, each with its own validation for the footage recording of each event. However, the previous two films have done something that V/H/S: Viral failed to do completely: include actual V/H/S tapes. Both parts one and two involve an individual searching through V/H/S tapes for answers.Viral has no concern for explaining why exactly we are watching segments of V/H/S tapes, or rather, how they ended up as a compilation on the same tape we are watching. It is assumed that the anthological installments of the film were previously recorded on the tape, while the introductory plot of the film is told between the three main segments. Furthermore, Viral's three segments are recorded in a fashion much more electronically advanced than those of the previous films, such as the use of documentary storytelling, camera headsets on helmets, and even aerial shots from helicopters. While the continuity and explanation of the film is shaky, to put it mildly, V/H/S: Viral still manages to be a chilling and highly entertaining experience, delving into black comedy and surrealism that is much more original than the plots used in the previous installments. The film begins with an enthusiastic man who cannot keep his camera off his voluptuous girlfriend as they return to his hometown for vacation. It is not long before night falls and he becomes aware of a car chase that is headed straight toward his home. In hopes of getting good footage to \"go viral,\" our protagonist decides to follow the car chase on bike, leading to the abduction of his girlfriend by a suspicious ice cream truck that initiated the car chase. It is then that the grainy V/H/S tape goes into white noise and we are introduced to the first segment in Viral's anthology, \"Dante the Great.\"\"Dante the Great\" is told in a documentary-like fashion with the overall plot occurring in real time. It follows the account of Scarlett, a young woman working as a magician's assistant who made a disturbing discovery involving the manner in which Dante the Great \"performs\" his magic tricks. We are informed that Dante was arrested for the murder of several of his assistants, with a resoundingly haunting method of murder. \"Dante the Great\" is a supernatural tale of magic and deceit, filled with gorgeous cinematography, gore, and hilariously compelling plot development. It is easily the most enjoyable of the segments, although its much more black comedy than it is horror.The second segment, \"Parallel Monsters,\" is the strangest and most difficult to decipher from the three parts of the anthology. It is a Spanish piece that tells the tale of a man who is successful in creating a portal to an alternate universe. As he peers through the portal, he sees himself, and timidly talks to his alternate self to see if their universes are alike. Both are in complete awe and agree to trade places for 15 minutes in each other's universes. Due to the shock value and possible spoilers for this segment, I will no longer discuss it, but let's just say the thrills and bloodshed come quickly in this fast-paced thrill ride through alternate universes.The final segment, \"Bonestorm,\" is a fitting end to the anthology before Viral returns to its core storyline. It is both captivatingly humorous and monstrously unnerving that it is near impossible to keep track of how to feel throughout the segment. We follow a group of teenage skaters with headpiece cameras attached to their helmets, hoping to catch their stunts on video. Due to a lack of adequate skating areas, the boys decide to travel to Tijuana where they believe there is a superb area to film themselves skateboarding. Upon arriving at said destination, they find a disheveled woman whispering about blood and the unleashing of a creature. The boys ignore her and silly banter ensues as they find their supreme skate destination, hardly giving a second thought to the giant pentagram drawn onto the cement floor. Chanting figures with horrific make-up and cloaks soon surround the boys, and the segment plays out like a contemporary homage to the original Evil Dead trilogy by being equally gory and engagingly funny.Ultimately, V/H/S: Viral is a highly entertaining horror flick that is more comedic and original in plot lines than its predecessors. However, that is not to say it is without its faults. The core storyline that is told between segments is one the film's failures, never living up to the expectation of terror promised by the ice cream truck kidnappings. The film's finale makes hardly any sense and is easily Viral's largest failure. Its lack of cohesive structure makes the film feel poorly executed and incomplete, which is a disappointment after such a strangely enjoyable experience. Overall, V/H/S: Viral is a film for horror buffs in the mood for a change in atmospheric intensity and storytelling. For better or worse, that is exactly what is provided.",

While not as good as the first two installments in the series, I still found V/H/S: VIRAL to be a pretty creative and entertaining movie. Admittedly, the plot of the wrap-around that surrounds the individual segments is really confusing, but it's still fun to watch. One thing that bothers me a little is that the movie didn't really have that one killer segment that really stood out like the first two movies had: There was the creepy \"Amateur Night\" in V/H/S and the totally insane \"Safe Haven\" in V/H/S 2. There's no such show-stopper in V/H/S: VIRAL. Nevertheless, I think all the segments were well-made and entertaining. Not really creepy or scary like some segments from the first two movies, but I enjoyed V/H/S: VIRAL nonetheless. My guess is that many people don't like this movie because it lacks the concept of the individual short movies being watched on a VCR as it was the case in the first two movies. I don't really mind that.",

            "content": "V/H/S Viral is the most recent instalment of its promising and head-bending two predecessors - V/H/S and V/H/S 2. The V/H/S series - up until this latest film - has offered a sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of perplexing and often ultra-violent found-footage sections of film; all tied neatly back to a kind of vague but important backbone-like storyline. The first two instalments created quite a stir with their raw, shaky video and poor quality audio, video-cassette-style tales of: ghosts, murder, zombies, aliens, satanic rituals, harpies and the like; and I was excited to see how this follow-up would fair in comparison.Fans of the other two will find instant disappointment, as the way the movie is shot/edited (including all that \"rough and raw\" goodness) seems to have been omitted? Instead, confusingly, this version has opted for a somewhat polished and hazy look. I'd compare it to a pub I used to go to that had a select few beers that tasted consistently beautiful, but after the pub became increasingly successful, the owner decided to turn it into a restaurant, update the menu, change the beers and throw away the pool table. Great for newcomers who know nothing of its former glory - terrible for those who knew how it got to be as good as it was. Fans of the previous two should note that this IS worth a watch as it will endeavour to clear up some of what V/H/S is all about, but at a price. It seems this version is like a large cocktail made of 45% documentary, 45% reality TV, 10% paranormal activity, and rounded off with a 'Dash' of V/H/S.There are some genuinely scary moments and some real worrying imagery mixed throughout - but don't get your hopes up too much.

The whole \"found footage\" genre has never really appealed to me, and I knew these movies to be a long those lines. I saw this on Netflix the other day, and although I hadn't seen the first two movies, I decided to watch this third installment anyway. This movie consists of four short stories, with a fifth serving as a wrap around to the whole thing. As it is with most anthology movies, the stories are either hit or miss. My favorite one happens to be the first story, which is the story of a magician who becomes overcome by the dark side of his profession. Usually in low budget movies such as this, they make up for that fact by healing on loads of gore. While this.movie does indeed have some.of the wet red stuff, its used sparingly and rarely. While definitely not q classic or staple of the horror genre, this movie is alright. I probably wouldn't watch it again though, and I don't know if I'll watch the first two in the series having seen this.",

The first movie was very unique and intriguing whereas second one had a handful of good moments.I was expecting something like that with this as well. Sadly my expectations were far from being met. As a fan of the series, I can say that this movie is a disaster.Not a segment works at its favour. The wrap around deals with a guy riding around his cycle looking for his kidnapped girlfriend. It interjects itself a lot twixt the other segments. I guess this was interesting enough to keep me watching the whole movie.The 1st segment had a lot of laugh-worthy moments. It just is so bad. The acting, the direction, the plot, everything works against it. It deals with an ambitious magician losing his mind.The 2nd segment was mediocre at best. It deals with a guy who creates a machine that connects his world with a parallel universe, and everything goes awry for him. Had a handful of laugh-worthy and gross moments (if you watch it you'll see what I mean). Again the plot and the acting is mediocre here as well.The 3rd segment should not have been there. It deals with a group of skateboarding youngster being target of crazy cultists. The synopsis might sound interesting right? But it's the worst thing about the movie. It's laugh-fest wholly, there wasn't a moment I didn't laugh when watching this one because the acting and the direction was so horrible.I guess this is what they mean when they say \"so bad, it made me laugh\", because this movie gave me that same feeling. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a horror, but it'd be an enjoyable movie if you want something to laugh at.",

The first 2 were really good and fairly successful. VHS was intended to become a franchise. This one was so bad and so disliked, it killed the franchise.. or so it seemed. Fast forward to 2021. It's been 7 years since this trainwreck and they're giving it another shot. I'm hoping whoever was responsible for this installment is kept far away from the new one. I have almost nothing nice to say about this film other than the story with the skateboarders was pretty cool and had great editing and camera work. The rest felt like being trolled. You have a goofball magician, men wearing spandex alien outfits, and an ongoing side story that makes zero sense. The writers and directors decided to get clever and go SyFy. It's definitely SyFy.

That was pretty awesome.Of course we have the snotty stoner kids that go to Tijuana in search of a new skate spot but meet up with a crazy Mexican death cult - this was my favorite.There's more. None of it makes much sense. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO in a movie like this. The whole thing was 110% awesome.

            "content": "Well I certainly expected to be disappointed by the third one after the decline from 1st to 2nd. But his goes beyond disappointment.First of all, in general terms, V/H/S's formula is very, very simple. A baseline Story about people in strange circumstances finds recorded footage containing even stranger circumstances. The one and only challenge here is the creativity to make up an excuse for the characters to be \"casually filming\" the obscure and bizarre. 1st did it quite well. All of the stories felt very natural and candid. 2nd one felt a bit more forced. But his one fails completely, I could not understand if they betrayed this simple formula in order to give themselves \"more room\" to tell more complex stories (and utterly failed in the process) or they were simply too lazy to give their own stories a creative way of narrating them with one point of view.About each individual story: 1st one, Dante. This one gets 0/10 stars. It is just awful. The kind of thing that makes you feel vicarious shame. This is the most overly produced of the three, with multiple camera shots, and even some interviews with fake \"personas\" that give their opinion on a police case. It centers around a Magician with a demonic cloak that was supposed to have been Houdinni's. Just putting it that way makes it sound like something you could watch in AXN at 16:00 on cable TV. But I assure it is much worse. There's quasi matrix style fighting, very poor pacing, and what absolutely killed it for me was the fireballs. Worse of all, it was not scary At All. It was just a dumb, badly executed, capricious story about a magician. No one wants to watch that.2nd one: Spanish portal. This one gets 5/10 stars. To be fair, it was the one that made me keep watching the film. It took a quite bold approach to a theme that hasn't been touched too much in sci-fi cinema at all. That made it tickle my curiosity quite a bit. It is about a Spanish engineer or inventor who creates an inter-dimensional gate in his basement. On his final attempt, he manages to connect his doorway with one of an identical Spanish inventor's in a mirror imaged dimension. They say hello and swap universes for 15 minutes. By that time I was quite wondered with the creativity and the simple but none the less, filled with infinite possibilities plot that was put in front of me after the mess that was Dante. To make it short, the other universe was a Satanic/Demonic/Anticatholic but quite candid version of this one. Though not directly \"Scary\", they managed to pace it at a very tense rate and created a quite unsettling ambiance. This is the only one worth watching.3rd one. Fu-Manchu's Evil Eye video-clip: This one gets 1/10 stars. It looks like a film that those very same skaters could have filmed over the weekend for a school project. Since there's nothing interesting on this one, I will sum it up: Skater kids filming skating videos go to Mexico to skate on an abandoned ditch. They're attacked by zombie / skeleton creatures. They retaliate with skateboards and a gun. That's it. Nothing more worth commenting. Just plain, cheap zombie short. Not scary, not even fun.Finally, the centerline: This one also gets 1/10 stars. You never quite understand what the point of this story is. In other V/H/S Films, the centerline is related to how were the other videos found. This one does not. It is just a mess of intentionally badly edited footage of a guy filming his girlfriend in different places. Suddenly it is all about a very dumb and very hard to make to sense ice cream truck police chase. The ice cream truck is a lame, overly used clich\u00e9 on its own. No body knows why, the girlfriend disappears, and camera guy chases after the truck on a bike. This makes you think, how can a guy on a bike, filming, can get to the truck and the police can not. Well, after few totally unnecessary scenes with gratuitous violence and a guy that films girls getting naked in a taxi (wtf?), camera guy get to the truck that is parked in the middle of a ditch. Inside there's old TVs and a recording of his girlfriend telling him to push a button. He does. His girlfriend appears outside the truck dead, with a phone on her mouth. Not scary, not fun, No sense at all.It really saddens me to see how a franchise that felt so fresh and interesting, and that was actually quite scary on it beginning (mostly the 1st V/H/S's web cam aliens, demon-chick and night stalker) has taken such a stupid, lazy, uncaring and even pretentious path.

One of things that make sequels work is when they follow the same \"rules\" that the first movie put in place. While remaking the same movie doesn't work, at least keep the principles in place because that is what we, as the viewers, expect. If you want to change the rules, the name the movie something else and don't attach it to the franchise. Also, the characters don't seem vested in the story, and their performance is painfully obvious. They seemed they were just looking for a paycheck, which hopefully was relative small based on their work.",

I've always found the found footage genre interesting, and VHS was unlike anything I had ever seen before. The first film's ability to keep suspense by hiding things behind impurities in the video print, combined with creative and well- executed stories, made it instantly a horror masterpiece. Then I heard there was a sequel. I looked it up on Netflix, and I was satisfied with what I got. It wasn't as shocking or gripping as the first, but the idea's were still creative, the writing and acting was all around well done, and by sequel's standards, it held up well. Then I heard they were making a third film. I got hyped, and watched it the day it came on Netflix. What. The. F*ck. I'm still not entirely sure VHS Viral is part of the VHS series. The ideas were still kind of interesting, but were done terribly. Dumb executions, half-assed acting, and the encompassing storyline is attempting to be melodrama, but just ends stupidly. My advice is to avoid this movie, put on VHS and VHS/2, and live in denial of the third one.",

I decided to watch it.What a horrible decision. V/H/S: Viral opens with intriguing shots of a couple talking about couple stuff and mandatory boobs and legs scenes. Following a chase going on around the block, our male protagonist just has to film it so it could be his \"break\". Confusion ensues. The movie is made of segments, as you probably know. And the first segment, after a while just ditches the format of \"found footage\" and hopes you won't notice. The movie is barely watchable up to that point, it gets absolutely ridiculous after. I'm pretty sure I even played one of the segments in a video game. Overall, I eagerly label this movie \"Stay the bleep away\".",

That said, VHS Viral is one of the worst movies I've ever seen period; inside or outside of the horror genre and I'm completely baffled by this.This time we only have 3 stories within the movie, and 2 of them are easily the worst in the trilogy, while one manages to be interesting, albeit not at all scary and if not for a few bloody moments, didn't really fit well anywhere in the trilogy. The 3rd story was the worst of the worst. So bad, in fact, I decided to skip ahead a bit only to realize that it was the last story.Which brings me to the wrap around which was just a cluster of awful. Starts off with one clear main idea, and then jumps to a group of other people randomly in the middle of the movie. Cringe worthy.This movie was an immense disappointment. It could not have been worse if M. Night Shyamalan was behind it. Even if you're a fan of the first two, as I am, don't waste your money. It will be in the $5 bins at Bestbuy in no time, and even then that's too much.",

            "content": "The first two V/H/S movies I enjoyed. They made me uncomfortable at times, explored some different ideas within the genre, and never put the tongue too firmly in cheek.In the latest entry to the series the concept of its title is abandoned right away. Gone are the claustrophobic \"it could happen anywhere\" stories which were the strength of these movies. Instead we get \"look at how everyone is making videos or everything you do is recorded somewhere\". And VHS tapes really have nothing to do with this anymore aside from a confusing reference in the first story.Onto the stories: The first story involving a magician is horribly acted. They also could have done more with the concept. Probably the worst in the bunch. Also it is a complete departure from the style and concept of filming for the two previous films.The second story is the most interesting. Not scary, but it does keep you guessing.The third story \"Bonestorm\" centered around skateboarders had the most potential. It seemed obvious right away that something bad was going to happen here. Then the tone changes a lot and our character's personalities are meaningless. Turns out this segment was done by two different directors. So that said, the first half is great. The second half disappoints. Also, there was a random moment of comedy stuck in an otherwise portrayed to be series entry. Killed all credibility.And then there's the wrap around. Overall this is probably the best story except that it falls apart at the end. Really there are two or three extra little shorts contained within it which are interesting and give some merit to the movie.If you liked the first two, you probably won't like this. Don't take my word for it though. This is just a review by some random dude on some website about movies. There are better horror movies you could waste time on is all I'm saying.",

I was also a big fan of the first two but this one lacked in so many ways. It had so many problems including: the magician short wasn't even found footage, the franchise is called VHS, yet this one had nothing to do with VHS tapes, and there were only three entries. That's just a few of the problems too.Though I am super curious about the entry that was cut? I read a review that rated each entry and the cut entry \"Gorgeous Vortex\" was given four our of five stars while the others were given bad ratings. There hasn't been a reason given as to why it was cut, but I'm almost wondering if they knew the movie would suck and didn't want one good entry along with the other crappy ones.The parallel universe one was good, a lot of the tension in the beginning, but the spoiler ruined it for me, and parts of it left me with lots of questions.",

The transitions with staticky blue screen, glitchy tape, and mixed in cell phone screen was confusing, loud and annoying. Too bad because the stories were still a bit better than the first VHS installment.I still don't understand the role of the ice cream truck. Was it broadcasting it's viral video while being made, which corrupted the brains of its viewers? Why did people fall off bridges or get run over? Why was it circling and why the hell didn't the cops simply cut it off. Beyond the plot holes, you have to have a high tolerance for jerky \"found footage\" camera style as the last story dishes it out like a bad elementary school casserole. The skateboarders were simply annoying punks and their behavior was extremely uncharacteristic of kids in a fight with weirdos. Your tolerance for bad, jerky camera work is put to the test with this installment, and be prepared for the \"reaction cam\" view in the third story as you get a lot of skateboarder faces in your face.

You don't see just one story where you pretty much predict everything. It maintains your interest and it is also humorous. Furthermore the V/H/S movies make good use of the 'amateur-cameraman' effect. Yes it's shaky but you can actually get to see something.

It doesn't feel like \"found footage\" anymore. Ruins the whole point. That was for the magician story anyways. The best parts of this film that felt true to the VHS tradition was the alternate reality story and the skateboarders story. I was blown away.
