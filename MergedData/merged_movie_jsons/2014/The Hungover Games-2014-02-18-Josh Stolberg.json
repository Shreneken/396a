            "content": "There is only one reason I watched \"The Hungover Games\"....it just appeared on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List today. This is a list of the 100 lowest rated major release films....and I am a major glutton for punishment, as I've seen 95 of the 100 movies on the list.It's not at all surprising that \"The Hungover Games\" is on the Bottom 100. After all, MANY similar brainless spoofs are on the list, such as \"Disaster Movie\", \"Epic Movie\", \"Date Movie\" and \"The Starving Games\"--and they are more or less the same. This is NOT a compliment. Each tends to have a lot of very crude and juvenile humor and they are anything but subtle or intellectual...or entertaining. And, like these other films, the mashups simply make no sense...such as merging \"The Hangover\" with \"The Hunger Games\", \"Lord of the Rings\", \"Avatar\" and \"Snowpiercer\". The film abounds with sex toys, crude humor that falls flat and...well,...that's about it.The biggest problem with this film and other similar stupid parodies is that they are way too broad. First, they are very broadly written--with little subtlety and with an emphasis on crude instear of being funny. Second, they are too broad in their focus and would be MUCH better sticking with ONE film or one style of film instead of parodying EVERYTHING...which is often illogical and frequently mindless.So is this one any better than the rest of these Bottom 100 parodies? Well, there is a lot of gratuitous nudity. This isn't necessarily good....but at least it distracts from the 'humor'. In fact ANYTHING that tries to distract from the dopey jokes is a major plus. Heck, having Pauley Shore come out and juggle or read from the Yellow Pages would be a welcome distraction from the 'humor'! In fact, as I watched \"The Hungover Games\", I cannot recall laughing even once and it's no funnier than the other unfunny parodies on the Bottom 100. A worthless film in pretty much every way that was probably written by chipmunks...really, really DUMB chipmunks.",

            "content": "This movie is dumb. Just look at the name. Yeah, I know it's not supposed to be smart but it is supposed to be funny, and unfortunately this is not. I will say that it is better than abominations like The Starving Games, Vampires Suck, Scary Movie 5 and Disaster Movie, but that's like saying dog p*ss is better than cat sh*t. They're both awful and both leave a bad taste in your mouth. This movie gets an extra point for potential. It's refreshing to see a spoof movie that isn't by the two that shall not be named, and some ideas in the movie do work. There's a plot this time: We follow the three Hangover guys (who bare a striking resemblance to their respective actors) on their Hunger Games adventure. I also like how the spoofs are limited to a certain character or group participating in \"The Hungover Games\", such as The Real House Wives, Ted, Thor, and a group of every Johnny Depp character of the past few years. Some of them are funny - I really wanted more of the Johnny Depps - but some just don't work. A team for gratuitous sex? I know it's making fun of the fact that a lot of movies have gratuitous sex for the sake of it but that's exactly what it's doing here, so it's like a spoof that's spoofing itself... and it's not nearly as deep as it sounds. I smiled a few times in this movie. The main cast was fine (the supporting cast had some horrendous actors though), and I like how the movie actually has a story and an attempt at coherency. But the number one thing I look for in a comedy are laughs, and The Hungover Games did not provide any. If you're smashed and with your friends and want to see a really dumb movie for some cheap laughs for an hour and a half then yeah you might enjoy The Hungover Games, but for anyone else, I implore you, don't watch this movie.",

Be it Carrie, Ted, every other character portrayed by Johnny Depp and so much more. Now if that alone leaves you chuckling ... well you will have fun with it. Whatever the case and a Jamie Kennedy that is annoying multiple times (as in more than one character portrayed), if you watch it, endure the end credits and get a bonus scene that will either infuriate you or make you laugh out loud.

Now, I am not saying that the movie is bad, it just really wasn't as funny as it was supposed to be. I can honestly say that I didn't laugh a single time throughout the entire movie.For a movie of this type, then \"The Hungover Games\" takes on a variety of other movies, such as \"Ted\", \"The Hunger Games\" (obviously), \"Pirates of the Caribean\", \"Avatar\", \"The Hangover\", \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", \"The Human Centipede\", \"The Lone Ranger\", and so forth. It is meant well, I am sure of it, but the comedy just slipped through every crack possible.The acting in the movie was adequate, and people were doing fair jobs with their given roles, they just didn't have too much of a script to work with.I used to love spoofs, such as \"Hot Shots\", \"Scary Movie\" and the like. Whether it is because I outgrew the genre, or because the spoof movies today are lacking what they did back in the 1990's, I do not know.\"The Hungover Games\" is good enough entertainment if you have absolutely nothing else to watch.",

There was a least some attempts at humor and they actually tried to make an actual parody film that wasn't full of irrelevant pop culture references that weren't funny (well, sorta), but compared to anything Setlzerberg has made, I give this an E for effort. It doesn't help that like Epic Movie, this film also features cameos from Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp version) and Captain Jack Sparrow and those were even still dated, back when Epic Movie was in theaters, back in early 2007. If want to watch this on Freedrive, I'd say go ahead, just don't expect anything like Airplane or Scary Movie.",

In my humble opinion absolutely nothing's 'wrong' with it, in fact I thoroughly enjoyed viewing it. The plot doesn't offend (it is what it has to be as a parody - KISS simple), the scriptwriting is excellent, the camera work/lighting is professionally done and the actors all do their part well. There was a synergism between the principal actors and they worked together really well. I can understand that the movie will not be to everyone's taste: the humor certainly is a little raspy-raw toilet humor at times but that certainly did not define the humorous content of the movie as a whole and there's an unashamed borrowing of ideas and more from other movies: but it works and works amazingly well! After reading other reviewers comments I didn't expect much from this movie but kept an open mind and I'm glad I did otherwise I'd have missed out on a very enjoyable movie experience.If I had to pick the most notable actor in this movie it would have to be the guy with the beard for his extraordinary portrayal of 'the other' guy with the beard in 'the other' movie. I also have to admit that I'm a fan of the beautifully sexy Rita Volk and she didn't disappoint. In summary then, nicely controlled tongue in cheek performances from the entire cast make for a very good laugh out loud piece of film entertainment. I rate it 6.5.",

It's kind of like offering me the choice of taking a bullet to the brain or a bullet to the heart. Neither film will ever be classed as a cinematic masterpiece.I do get the feeling though that the makers of \"The Hungover Games\" are actually trying. They've tried to write a good script, they've tried to give it decent production values and even the actors seem to be trying. It's a little more than can be said of the stuff that Freidberg & Seltzer keep pumping out. It's perhaps a little disappointing then that none of the jokes in the film really seem to deliver and it all seems to land off-target. I didn't laugh once.I was sober when I watched this. Maybe to enjoy it the most you do actually need to be hungover! That's the only time I'd probably find some of this movie actually funny. A-plus for effort but C-minus for execution. Not great.",

            "content": "Spoof films are extremely hard to pull off. The key is to be subtle, yet not so much so otherwise the audience will not understand the joke. It is imperative though to not make the gags brash and obvious. This is where the alleged comedy 'The Hungover Games' fails.This parody stars lookalikes of The Hangover series and is supposed to be a follow on from 'The Hangover Part II'. The creators of The Hangover series had no part in this spoof and if they did, there would at the very least be something to laugh about. All you can find funny here is the incompetence of the Director and writers.In the film the Wolf Pack or the lookalikes of them get drunk again the night before Doug's wedding. Unfortunately for themselves they are entered into the Hungover Games and must fight to the death against other celebrities and film characters to survive.The only positive for 'The Hungover Games' is that in the opening text it informs us that this deathly tradition came about because of \"Hollywood's lack of creativity\". Now that I can agree with. Yet why mock the lack of creativity when the film you have possesses the same quality? It makes no logical sense but perhaps that is the point. As the film has no logic to call its own.The many negatives for 'The Hungover Games' can be collated into a list, thus outlined below. Pop culture references are only funny if done in a tasteful manner or with some notable skill. I know it's exceedingly odd to compare this film to a Disney one and yet Hercules knew how to handle pop culture references and still achieve the key for a comedy \u2013 laughs.Other jokes are either scatological, racist, homophobic, sexist or all of the above. 'The Hungover Games' never knows when to stop in terms of the excessive nature of the gags and its relatively short run time still manages to feel far too stretched for its own good.It's especially bothersome to watch when this comedy has less jokes than 2012's 'The Hunger Games'. I'm not sure how this was managed but its an impressive achievement none the less.Even the shots in the film are sickening to look at, filmed poorly and cheaply. People who took issue with the presence of shaky camera in the first Hunger Games film had better close their eyes promptly as well as covering their ears.I could go on and on about this films problems but I really do not wish to. In fact I would rather go and watch a comedy that makes me laugh to my heart's content. With every film I see, I feel that every single one deserves a chance. With Stolberg's 'The Hungover Games' I plead you to steer clear and not give it the benefit of the doubt. Film making this shallow does not deserve to be viewed by anyone of any age.",

Not rolling around on your back, or tears streaking your cheeks funny, but this is a good parody. There are a lot of exceptional cameos, and the main cast of Hangover guys are all better than you would expect. I liked the touch of having the character names in this movie be the names of the actors, it added that extra layer of unreality. There are terrible jokes in here, and lots of terrible acting to go along with those jokes, but and I'm no fan of Jamie Kennedy he was one hard working producer in this. I really did Enjoy this movie, and was totally surprised that I did. From the start though you can feel that this is a bit better than most of the crap they have been doling out for the past few years, and only barely, but because of that I do recommend this to most people. There is a whole district dedicated to gratuitous nudity, so you can expect some of that, and lots of very simulated violence, but the language is really quite tame.

And for the most part, the storyline, or at least the first fifthteen minutes is also exactly the same as the 2009 Vegas Comedy. Just like in those movies, the fourth friend of the group is misplaced, leaving the first three to try and remember all the terrible things that they did the night before, in an attempt to rediscover him. I know this is a parody, but really? Word-for-word lines from The Hangover have been pilfered as their own. It's astonishing the true lack of any creativity that The Hungover Games possesses, whereas other awful spoof movies such as, say, Scary/Epic Movie seem to have some (very few) of their own ideas, here, \"writers\" Kyle Barnett Anderson et al, make it feel like they've photocopied Todd Philips' screenplay badly and then taken it for themselves. But it turns out our three buddies have been transported to Hunger Games Land where they have to fight to the death with all the other favourable movies of the last seven years or so. This takes all those films you may have possibly enjoyed over the past few years and throws them in to one terrible mush: watch as the Ted bear has a penis, Katniss Everdeen has had her name changed to \"Katnip\" (HA!), and Willy Wonka is a homosexual. Add to that pops at race, some Human Centipede \"jokes\", underage sex gags and just a little bit of necrophilia and you experience an hour and a half of pure film diabolica. And for the people who defend the jokes for being jokes, perhaps if they were funny, fine, but otherwise it just comes off as offensive and downright lazy. The brow for this movie is so low that it's scraping along the ground.I'll end on the only two positives: The people who play the Hangover team are very convincing, and the film itself is shot quite nicely. Otherwise, please, do not go and see this movie. I would rather have been dispatched by a Hunger Games arrow to the face then to have seen this film. Run \u2013 sprint, even \u2013 away if someone suggests watching this piece of garbage. @JonnyJonJon1",

If you can't bother to write more then one line about the movie and have to go on babbling like a idiot for the rest of the review you know that watching this movie would only be a waste of time. Really I would highly recommend choosing any other movie to see.

In the process, it attempts to criticize Hollywood for a lack of originality. This is perhaps the only funny joke in the movie, seeing as it is itself completely without original thought.It doesn't make fun of the Hungover characters, it just copies them and reenacts their mannerisms in the Hunger Games world. In the process, it also includes various other token characters from pop culture. However, these tertiary characters are fitted with poorly done costumes and for the most part equally poor actors.I must however admit, that many of the actors in the movie are above average for the genre. The story and whole setup is extremely lazy however. I have a hard time imagining anyone being particularly proud of this movie.The movie leaves a lot to be desired, but I suppose it could be watched during a severe case of hangover.",

The film does offer plenty of typical juvenile jokes but it also does contain some clever and witty humorous jokes as well. The lead actors spoofing the lead cast of the Hangover characters are well done, as they portray the characters brilliantly, specifically the actor playing Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis. The film isn't great but comparing it to earlier spoof parody films such as Epic Movie, Disaster Movie or Date movie, this film succeeds as it is more enjoyable and has better character development as well as funnier scenes. The R rating is what makes the film better, as we see the film come fold as one.",

One group of weird people said enough. There have been too many hammy, crappy, unfunny spoofs feeding on the scraps of potheads with a Netflix account. It was time change came to That film was \"The Hungover Games\" and it is a damn good effort to put an end to a decade of utterly unwatchable spoofs.

Special effects made by professionals exceeding their limitations, and a teddy bear tea-bagging an escaped slave.This film is non-stop laughter.

It felt like everything that COULD have been funny just ended up being stupid in- your-face nudity. Relying on dildos, curse words, pee, poo and breasts to make a scene funny just seems lazy.
