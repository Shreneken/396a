You can guarantee that no matter what new horror film comes out it will garner posts on the likes of IMDb as being \"the worst horror film I have ever seen\". That is until the next big release, where we will go around the houses again... Ouija is just a standard boo-jump horror picture with a standard story line. Any expectation of any thing more would have (will do) led (lead) to great disappointment. It's one of those horror films that asks you to turn off the lights and just enjoy the quick spooky ride, then you get off the ride and quickly move on to something else. It's neither \"the worst horror film of all time\" or anything remotely original. It's Boo-Jump horror 101, so buy into that or leave it well alone. 6/10",

But no, Ouija is not fun. It's very, very boring.Everything about this movie fails on so many levels. The writing doesn't have a single original or interesting idea, and it doesn't even make sense in the end. The acting is dull, though that's largely due to the fact that our characters spend the majority of the film moping around their houses and at school. There's no way of gaining momentum of suspense when nothing is happening. The characters play the board game a couple times and there are a handful of cheap jump scares and bad effects. That's it. The direction is flat and indifferent. Worst of all, it's not scary in the least.Ouija is the absolute bare minimum for a horror movie, completely devoid of energy, inspiration, and any interest in telling an original story.",

And so, of course, I decided to go and watch the first film in the series, simply titled, \"Ouija\". I did so despite my having been warned by a couple of friends that it was a pretty bad movie. But, come on, how bad could it really be??? \"Origin of Evil\" is AWESOME....so the first one must be pretty good, right?Wrong. This movie is terrible. TERRIBLE.About the only thing I can say for the movie is that it does more or less follow the storyline of the prequel (although there are some glitches there, too), and as such it was marginally fun to find out how the story ends, so to speak.But, man, this movie just downright sucks all the way around. The plot is bad, the acting...is...OK, but nothing to write home about. The story is not developed at all, and it's like they just threw together a few general concepts and tossed it into a movie.All that said, it really is like they made the terrible sequel first, after the hit horror movie. The 2016 prequel is leaps and bounds better than this movie. But this movie itself is weak as can be. 2/10 stars....a rating I have hardly ever given before. This one's bad folks. Real bad.",

            "content": "\"Ouija\" has a pretty cool and creepy story to work with, an old spirit board discovered in the attack, suicides and haunting, a creepy legend that connects the board to the house of the suicide girl, it is all perfect horror subject matter. Unfortunately there is something missing from \"Ouija\" that makes it more spectacle than horror. The scenes build nicely through suspense, shadowy, eerie atmosphere, and great sound effects, but the end result falls flat. The big scares aren't really scary. The cast give well enough performances of these haunted characters. The direction and cinematography are equally stellar. You can tell money was well spend in production, \"Ouija\" has all the right components to be a real good horror film, unfortunately it all stays pretty PG. The horror seems almost pulled back into safer zones when they should have took that thrilling momentum and gone for some major scares. Not sure why they chose to keep things subdued. I mean really for what \"Ouija\" is it is a nice, creepy Halloween horror film based on an occult staple-the spirit board. And there are a few scare-ish moments that use the sudden shock gimmick to get a jump out of the movie-goer but still this film is far less exciting than say \"Insidious\" or \"The Conjuring\".",

Olivia Cooke and Shelley Hennig play a couple of college ding bats who played with this so-called toy when they were young. Now news is out that Hennig hung herself along with her Christmas lights. This doesn't make for a jolly good festive holiday. Cooke gets together with her younger sister, her boyfriend, Hennig's boyfriend, and a waitress friend and they explore this board in the decease's house. It's all too convenient when every parent and adult seems to have something better to do out of town for plot convenience. Or perhaps they knew how stupid this film is and skipped town. At any rate director Stiles White fails to impress viewers with phoney jump scares, many of which have been done in other equally idiotic films. He loves to linger that camera on that board piece that resembles an oversized guitar pic with a glass piece. Much of the so-called scares are hokey and more laugh worthy than a Three Stooges short film. Lin Shaye even makes an appearance as a bat crazy elderly to remind us that she was in the superior, but not great Insidious. The lighting and production is fair at best but the best thing to do with a film this bad is to join the characters when they toss the Ouija board in the fireplace. Sure, the board survives, but with a little hope, this pathetic showcase will burn. Score: 2 / 10",

It is also fairly slow-burning, and not terribly surprising, although the story did manage to keep me interested. I quite liked the performances and the characters, and the film managed to avoid the clich\u00e9 bratty kid sister which looked like looming up at one point.It is a bit too gentle and slow to satisfy hardcore horror fans, but I have seen worse horror films. And the girls in it are cute.

            "content": "In recent times, never has a horror film centered entirely around the Ouija board game, and perhaps for good reason - it is a bit too foolish to be believable.Ouija boards have been utilized in horror films countless times before, as a last ditch effort to communicate with a disturbed spirit on the other side when a medium led seance is out of the question. 2014's horror film Ouija instead puts the cause and focus of the strange disturbances directly upon the game itself.After one of their friends inexplicably is found dead in a suspected suicide, a group of friends turn toward her Ouija board in a desperate attempt to find answers and closure. When it appears a communication channel has been opened with the dead things take a dark and unsettling turn.Stiles White co-writes and directs this painfully formulaic film. What audiences should expect to get from Ouija is your classic 'strange occurrences, oh no people dying, let's investigate to uncover the truth to hopefully appease the spirits'. While formulas typically exist because on some level they do work, this one has been bludgeoned to boredom inducing death.Typically if a film is going to be this standard then some sort of redeemable part of it must shine through, either through stellar characters portrayed by undiscovered gems or uniquely gruesome horror scenes. Ouija is a film that opens incredibly weakly, like a rough cut that should have been a reshoot. Once the group of friends, led by up-and-coming horror queen Olivia Cooke, make contact through the Ouija board the terrifying scenes considerably improve but never prove wow-worthy and still border on clich\u00e9.The most substantial error in the entirety of the film is the overall serious tone. The teenage high school students are all a bit too earnest when it comes to using a Ouija board. Stiles and his co-screenplay writer Juliet Snowden just really have no idea how to write realistically for teen youths. There is no humor or sarcasm, no sass and no disbelief when one of the friends approaches the other to use the Ouija board.Teens, even in the event that one kills him or herself, use humor as a coping mechanism. if one of my friends said 'we need to talk to ____ on the other side' I would laugh in his or her face from the ludicrous nature of the proposition.Further everything that propels the story forward in Ouija is a bit far-fetched. Most of the teens are incredibly serious about dental hygiene, with several scenes featuring them flossing. The adults all must have minored in Paranormal Occurrences and How to Deal with It. Overall Ouija was not scary and the extenuating circumstances surrounding the plot were laughable at best.Check our website for more full reviews of recent releases.",

It turns out that the friend made a cardinal sin by playing a ouija board alone, which has allowed a spirit to escape and now it's after the friends.OUIJA is the latest horror film that offers up zero scares and zero originality. I know a lot of people are attacking this film because it's rated PG-13 but I'm certainly not going to do that. After all, JAWS was rated PG and it was pretty darn scary. This film here is the latest example of everything that's wrong with the genre and that's the fact that instead of building an atmosphere or any type of real tension, instead we're given a bunch of loud bangs that are supposed to scare us.I guess if you scare extremely easy and will jump at anything then you'll find this terrifying but if you've ever seen a horror movie in your life then it's doubtful that you're going to find much here. For starters, the characters are extremely annoying and especially the lead girl. The problem I had with her is that she's the one from the opening sequence that believes in the powers of the ouija board and yet everything something happens with it she's the first to not believe. I'm not sure why she's so smart at the board except when something evil is happening and then she's as dumb as a board.The supporting friends are all poorly written and just don't add anything to the mix.The CGI scare effects are all extremely lame. Another problem is that the death scenes are all unimaginative and contain absolutely no scares. Is there anything good about the picture? Well, it does contain some nice cinematography and there's no doubt that technically it's well-made. However, that matters very little because there's not a single scare to be found and there's not an ounce of atmosphere. OUIJA is a pretty bad horror film that is silly, unoriginal and not at all scary.",

So to make it a prime topic for a horror film is a no-brainer. So what are the chances that the filmmakers actually took the time to write a scary story, or create a scary or intense atmosphere? One would hope so, but this isn't that type of film. Produced by Platinum Dunes, yes Michael Bay's film company, Ouija is a bland, by the numbers horror flick that lacks scares and ups the boredom factor. I give the film some credit, it started decent enough, but sooner than later it dives into the horribleness one would expect from a rushed cash grab flick. I find this film to be a prime example of what is wrong with the horror genre these days. I can't recall any characters in this film or what they did. It had people just saying lines to the camera and each other. The scares were boring beyond comprehension. The dreaded PG-13 rating destroys any chance for anything really scary, interesting or bloody. Ouija is a failed opportunity, one that could have given us something interesting. I'm not just disappointed in it, I'm embarrassed by it. Ouija is almost an insult to the horror community. Not even the lame third act twist (yes, I'm ruining the fact that there is a twist) is enough to give the film a decent finish. It hurts my brain thinking about this film so I'm going to cut this review a bit short.Expect to see a sequel sometime soon, just don't 'see' it.",

It's all newcomers aged in their twenties coming from teenage series. Not that that should be bad, I admit, I like watching Teen Wolf, it's full of suspense and there are scary moments. But here in Ouija, there's nothing, no suspense, no horror, no gore to be clear, nothing at all. And when the so-called horror comes in it's done with CGI. Don't get me wrong, when eyes are turning from normal to white I can dig it that it's done with CGI, but the ghosts disappearing in CGI, the mouths done CGI, in fact too much CGI, just see the last ghost appear, it's done on-camera but suddenly the CGI comes in again.

I will say, I adore Olivia Cooke, who plays the lead in the movie, but she didn't meet my expectations in this movie...her acting was, for a lack of a better word, lacking.IF you enjoy jump scares, this movie is definitely for you. Ouija has jump scares through out the movie, which made it a pretty entertaining watch.Overall, decent movie, nice jump-scares, okay-acting, but too abrupt of an ending. The movie as a whole was not bad, but the ending was a little disappointing to me. It seemed to end pretty quickly; I wished it was dragged out a little bit longer.Should you watch in theaters? Yes, if you are into the jump-scares. It's not the best movie, but it isn't the worst either. Besides that, wait to rent it.Ouija had a lot of potential, but I personally thought that it could have been better if they tweaked the ending. There were several unresolved problems, and it's kind of weird that you barely see these kids' parents at all besides the beginning of the movie. Like, seriously, where are these kids' parents?",

The \"dirty hippies\" that did it in the mud at Woodstock were the exception to the rule. Hippie or not, ALL the women of the 1960s were grubby, since they were afraid to take showers after what Norman Bates did to Janet Leigh in the motel room shower he had rented to her earlier that fatal evening. It took nearly two decades for that soap-averse female generation to move through the reproductive pipeline, a period referred to as the \"Baby Bust\" by today's sociologists. Similarly, bad things happen when ladies attempt to floss their teeth during the current release, OUIJA. Maybe dentists will be benefiting from this boondoggle a few years from now only on the feminine side of the street. It would not be surprising if the American Dental Society were handing out bushels of complimentary tickets as we speak for their teenage girl patients to go see OUIJA.",

            "content": "\"Ouija\" is somewhat of a paradox of a film. Imagine a movie made by the makers of a game warning you not to play the game. Now imagine the makers of a game warning you not to play it, but double-dog daring you to play it. I've pretty much just described Hasbro's supernatural horror dud \"Ouija.\"A girl is mysteriously killed after recording herself playing with an ancient Ouija board. A group of her friends investigate the spirit board. They soon find out some things aren't meant to be played with when they awaken the dark powers of the \"other side.\"\"Ouija\" is one of those movies where the kids involved do incredibly stupid stuff, make all the wrong decisions, and then die because of their bad choices. Unlike most teen slasher films, there's nothing fun or humorous here to be found. It's just one predictably bad action after the next resulting in death for whoever committed the transgression against the dead.Set up like a visual instruction manual, \"Ouija\" teaches you how to play the board game you know you shouldn't. It's like they're taunting you to play with fire. Imagine someone telling you not to do something, but then giving you exact guidelines on how to do it. The actors say the words they're supposed to and follow the rules to communicate with the dead\u0085 which is never a good idea, by the way. It all plays out like an over-extended TV commercial to sell the game.The ultimate message of \"Ouija\" is you shouldn't play with the occult. Unfortunately, the message gets a little jumbled up when the friends use it to do battle against the spirits. Okay\u0085 so don't use it unless you need to use it to fight the bad guys? Am I getting this right? \"Ouija is rated PG-13, of course. Why wouldn't it be since its target demographic is plainly teens looking for mild scares. It includes disturbing violent content, frightening horror images, and thematic material.Any Christian is going to have problems with watching \"Ouija.\" We're all warned from childhood not to play with the occult or communicate with the dead\u0085 and with good reason. It's pretty cut and dry in the Bible. When my wife found out I watched the movie in our home, she made me immediately take it out of the house and put it in the car. The film really does send a mixed message to younger viewers. \"Ouija\" is obviously an attempt at both promoting a Hasbro board game and creating a teen version of \"Insidious\" or \"The Conjuring.\" However, there's nothing to be found here that is even half as endearing or memorable as either of those two films. Even the little twist during the climax can't save the movie in the end.",

It started out okay with actually nicely done opening (which is sadly the only decent part of the movie) and it looked like it was aiming to build some characters, but when the actual plot starts, it all fails miserably. A lot of false scares, that may only make you jump by the sudden loud booming noise you always see in jump-scares, if that. Then when they try to do actual scares, it's just so clich\u00e9d, so generic and uninteresting. The acting isn't completely bad, at least not by the lead, Olivia Cooke, who is a pretty good actress especially when you see Bates Motel.

Secondly, the fact that I was able to anticipate 80 to 90% of the times when the scare was going to fall.

One of the main things that really holds this one down is the rather confusing amount of time taken here to get the storyline set-up in this. It's quite early on that we get the trigger for the events to start in the apparent suicide yet there's a lot of time afterward not only for the discovery of the body but also to start with the collective attacks against the group which is handled in a rather confusing manner. There's several occurrences of them playing with the board and yet nothing is really done for those times which really tends to ignore the fact that each of these previous encounters had resulting in something going on and then doing nothing with them as the supernatural activities observed from the first such encounter should've been the clue that rang out something was going on. This drags itself through several of these throughout here which manages to force the pace into such a crawl that it's hard to stay invested here and then causes the film to bring out a ludicrous twist in the final half just to bring the film up to a respectable running time since the rest of the pacing is so slow and dragging it has to rush through the biggest part here even after already dealing with it already and throwing another curve-ball simply to beef it up even more. Likewise, the film's timid-ness and rather lame death scenes here, though brutal in content, are so lacking in execution that the film's obviously toned-down rating becomes quite apparent here with this one really becoming ham-strung by keeping itself from really letting loose with its intentions. This one really could've used a little more gruesomeness in its kills, yet nothing of the sort happens here simply to keep the rating down, which is a pretty big factor here. Still, while these flaws are readily apparent throughout here the film does offer up some really chilling moments here, which consists almost mainly of it's supernatural hauntings from the times of its' interaction on the titular board. The early instances of the receptor moving by itself and flying around the room which makes for some chilling scenes, while the main action scenes of the group's encounters while playing with the object come off so well that there's a strong atmosphere throughout these scenes from seeing the ghosts interacting in the world around them only through the glass which is some really thrilling moments. Elsewhere, the finale here back in the house is a lot of fun with the attacks on the friends to trap them away in different sections of the house, the fateful game being played in the basement in front of the fireplace and the big ghost action throughout that sets up the grand resolution quite nicely. These are all fun and enjoyable with some thrilling action along the way to help it out, and does come up with some positives to counteract the flaws even though there's still some problematic areas.Rated PG-13: Violence and Language.",

            "content": "'Ouija' moderately drew me into seeing it, with a cool poster/cover, an intriguing if not particularly original premise and as someone with a general appreciation for horror. That it was low-budget, which from frequent personal experience is rarely a good sign due to that there are so many poor ones out there, made me though apprehensive as well as the low rating and poor reviews here. Yet another film seen recently unfortunately, hence some reiteration because the exact same strengths and flaws those films have are present here, that to me was incredibly disappointing considering its potential which it doesn't do anywhere near enough with. 'Ouija' is terrible, with a plethora of problems (huge ones too) and doesn't do enough with its potential, which was hardly small. There is really nothing to recommend other than Olivia Cooke trying her best and actually being pretty okay.Unfortunately, 'Ouija' is shot and edited so poorly, looking like a school project shot on a shaky camera or a phone by an unsteady hand, and the drab and overly-dark colours. It was very clear that the film was made in a rush with no care or enthusiasm. In particular, the camera work was a nauseous assault on the eyes with its excessive amateurish-ness and the lighting is far too dark and a lot of the time inappropriately so.Going on further to the negatives, the story does feel paper thin, disjointed and over-stretched and some of it feels vague, under-explained in the last third where the film especially became duller, more predictable, more senseless and less scary. Too many characters are too sketchy and with nowhere near enough to make one want to endear to them. Their annoying and illogical decision making and behaviours frustrates and are overdone.Making the film feel bland and forgettable with not enough heart put into it. The effects are ropy at best, the sound quality is obvious and utilised cheaply (being too loud in the build ups and people's reactions) and it's best not mentioning the elsewhere lumbering, awkward and histrionic acting that shows a huge indifference to the situation and what is going on.Dialogue can be stilted and rambling, with lots of clich\u00e9s, lots of unintentional humour and no depth whatsoever, while the pace goes to a standstill very quickly and drags on forever with very little going on worth caring about and useless padding, never recovering. Found too many the supposedly shocking moments not surprising or scary and the supposedly creepy atmosphere dreary, due to the excessive obviousness, a lot of dumb and vague moments and explanations and the lack of tension and suspense. Would not have minded the lack of originality (the film is extremely derivative and in a dumbed and watered down way) if the story and atmosphere were at least alright in execution, in reality they were both incredibly poorly done.A lot of 'Ouija' often nonsensical and confusing character motivations, while too many of the things to make you jump or shocked are far from creative or scary and are pretty tame. Most of those attempted in fact are very contrived and will make one roll the eyes than jump. The film often fails to make sense, is very by the numbers and there is no imagination.There is not enough threat, and what there is of it tends to be used poorly, it is completely unimaginative and more odd than creepy, completely failing to show any sense of horror or creativity. Everything here is neither creative, suspenseful or nail-biting and much of it absurd. Some badly sagging momentum too. The direction is leaden, with an all over the place visual style, and like their heart was not in it or ill at ease, with the non-existent chemistry between the characters and actors coming over as constantly random. This is very dreary and amateurish stuff that fails to be scary, interesting or easy to follow, with the deaths being un-creative, too easily foreseeable and lame in execution.In conclusion, very poorly done. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

It did not suck and it did not rock. *It was basically a mixture of Insidious and Final Destination.* The scares in the movie were typically those corny jump-scares, but I have to say, they weren't bad. (Or really that good, either.) The thing about PG-13 horror movies is that they aren't really that scary at all. This movie was alright, I wouldn't say scary, but it would be enough to scare a little kid because of the loud noises and scary images. The story is okay. It kind of gets better and worse and better and worse. In the beginning, the story is declining, getting worse and worse, because of all the clich\u00e9 and disappointing climaxes. Then, it sort of gets better... and then back down to really bad. Then, in the second half of the movie, it starts to get really, really, intense and actually good. When you think it's over, it isn't. But when it is over, you wouldn't think that was the end. The acting was.. okay? In the beginning the acting totally STANK! I mean, it was really fake. But it got better and better as the movie progressed. The main character, Laine (Olivia Cooke) did an okay job of acting. She was the type in the movie that was sort of dumb, but in the end turned out to be a bit clever. All the things in the movie that happen are mostly things that you'd expect to happen. The special effects really were disappointing, when the monster/entity (not revealing any more than that) is shown, WOW are the effects SO FAKE.Lastly, don't let reviews change your mind about a movie. They are simply opinions. Just because this movie has under average ratings doesn't mean that you will automatically think this movie will and always will stink. Don't always look at the negative sides of a movie. :) And also, be careful.

I gave up on expecting character development in these type of horror movies long time ago but I was still waiting something in the sense of story telling which this movie has none of it.Quija heavily relies on one thing. Trying to scare people by off screen boo effects because it doesn't have a story to tell. A group of high school kids get a Ouija board and gather around a table to find out why their beloved friend hung herself. Of course, the answer is not that clear and soon after, whatever they communicated with, starts chasing the group.The main problem of this movie is relying on jump scares rather than making the movie itself scary with the ambiance, story and the situations characters are in like Insidious, The Conjuring, Anabelle etc. If your friend suddenly tried to scare you every five minutes, how would you feel? Or would you still be scared after an hour or rather become annoyed? I'll go with the latter and that's what happens with this movie.Considering the 5 million dollar budget, I wasn't expecting much but when you think that the first Paranormal Activity had a thirty thousand dollar budget, I bet this movie could have made a lot better than what it is now.Unfortunately, Ouija lacks tension, horror, likable characters and all the things that a good movie has. It's a bummer to see that we don't have a good scary movie on a Halloween weekend and certainly Ouija does not have the fun you are looking for.P.S: If you really want to get scared and are looking for a movie about Ouija boards, then you should check out the British scary movie \"Long Time Dead\". Although it was made more than 12 years ago, it is a lot more scarier, gory and more successful than this awful Ouija mess.",

I told them that I own an Ouija Board\u0099 and have never been able to get it to function. The funniest thing about this item is its history. They were called \"spirit boards\" and regarded as a harmless parlor game unrelated to the occult until American Spiritualist Church founder Pearl Curran popularized its use to speak to the dead. So in effect, a Christian church made them popular. In the past, I have spoken to several members of the Spiritualist Church and they seem to have no clue about the history of their church and the board. They still practice speaking with the dead but reject the board due to popular beliefs.Later in the mid 1960's, Parker Brothers took the trade name Ouija, which is French for yes and German for yes. They sold a few before the more popular horror movie \"The Exorcist\" came to the screen. After that event, churches and uninformed people began burning them and making up urban legends about the game board. So I find it ironic that a mere fictional movie caused all the hysteria and hype about this parlor game.Now as to the movie, the board itself was no more than a prop for this movie. Much like the VHS tape was for \"The Ring\". It was more about a mentally disturbed mother who tortured her daughter. The movie was basically a jump scare film and only one caught me off guard, but it didn't scare me. This week I have been watching some old 1980's horror movies like \"Hell Raiser\" now that is classic and very scary. They depend on old school effects and not computer generated ones.

Dead friend, who they try to connect and say goodbye. An old house with a dark history. I just don't understand why you always have to go to ghost house after dark, when you can be sure that electricity wont work, flashlights will get broken and you never get enough light from candles. And of course there has to be an relative who lives in asylum and a swimming pool at backyards which is covered with plastic coat, because it is a autumn and leaves are falling from trees. There also has to be a dusty attic and secret basement with corps in the house...how convenient is that??? If you find this movie on DVD and you get it cheap, watch it because it is so stupid. It is not worth a movie ticket, so avoid it if you can.",

            "content": "Along with the many unnecessary remakes we get in the horror genre, films made based off of action figures or board games are probably the most unnecessary that I can think of in the film industry. We should completely understand why this genre of film exists though. If you are making these types of films, likely there is a target market already in place for them. These movies don't work though because it's not like your going to have source material for them because the film is only about a game or a doll. One prime example of these problems occurs in the film Battleship. The film feels nothing liking the classic game Battleship due to the characters and plot elements. Whenever I play Battleship, it's not like I am introduced to characters or a plot. The source material of the game is not at all related to the movie elements. Ouija is the latest dip into this genre in 2014.Ouija is an infamous spirit board and it's purpose is to talk to the dead and it is self-explanatory why we see ouija boards only in horror films. Films like The Exorcist from 1973 or Paranormal Activity from 2009 are some examples of horror films with Ouija boards. Ouija boards have turned into an urban legend with supposed deaths occurring because of them and this is one reason why my girlfriend hates them with a passion. I am the first one to say that Ouija as it's own movie based off the board would be hard due to because you need a lot of material to support it but it is still an interesting idea none the less. As it turns out, Ouija is enough to get by but still nothing very promising.After Debbie Galardi (Shelley Hennig) commits suicide after finding a Ouija board in her room, a group of her closest friends come together to find the reason for her suicide though none of them know that the board itself might be the problem.As I said before, this is the type of plot that needs to rely on substance to survive because it is only based off a game board. The substance though here is average at best. Kill scenes we have all seen before, pacing that is all over the place and a low budget to the film as evidenced by it's lack of location and sets. Ouija is a film that is put together in a way that makes it come off as very unmemorable. The film's downfall can also go back to the characters. Casting teenagers in these PG-13 horror films is already the norm but in the end, there is really nothing here to see from the cast. There is no substance whatsoever to the characters and they are made in a way that makes you not like or dislike them. They are characters you just watch waiting for the ending. Even Lin Shaye shows up as Paulina Zander, a character that has an interesting backstory to film. This backstory though that feels like a last minute idea and comes into the film too late. The maid of the house played by Vivis Colombetti is quite underused and is a big waste of an idea and a character.Much like the film Mama from last year or other horror remakes, Ouija is a slumber party film for teenagers girls to get scared who do not know about good horror films yet or will never know. You could even say it is also a film meant to watch with your significant other because at theater for my showing, the place was filled with nothing but couples. Ouija is the type of horror film that I can choose to forgot and will certainly forgot about once I pick the best horror films from 2014.",

From the direction, the screenplay, the acting, this is a hollow film that could have found an audience on Netflix rather than wasting a ton of money putting this in theaters. Following a group of friends, hollowly portrayed by every actor, they awaken an evil spirit via the infamous board game. This sounds like a cool concept but the fact remains that most cool concepts almost always have a shoddy film to accompany it. This is no exception. It is slow, painfully boring, not scary and ridiculous especially in its preposterous third act. This is one of those films that could have had the potential to be an extremely unnerving film but instead, it relies on clich\u00e9 scares and cheap acting for us to try and grasp, only to realize after the first of many cheap scares this is nothing like The Conjuring, Dead Silence, or The Ring. This is more on par with The Ring 2 and The Grudge. There is simply no point to it all which makes the scares less and less scary and more and more funny as it goes on. Overall, there isn't much more to say about this film without becoming redundant. Its a horribly acted, terribly written, and atrociously directed film that I wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy. Yes, Ouija is THAT bad.",

            "content": "Okay you know Hollywood is getting desperate when they are scraping into the board game barrel for a movie idea. Tonight's review is on the latest horror story that involves another trip down the spirit communicating pathway. I'm talking about the movie Ouija, which from the trailers looked to be another simplistic scare story designed to make you fear the dark. Can this movie compete with the recently released Annabelle, or is it just another brick in the wall of moderately decent horror films. I've never known Ouija to be a popular board game, but this isn't the first time the simplistic board game has been put into a movie. Ouija seems to be remake of the films proceeding it, taking certain aspects of it's predecessors and recycling them into one 90 minute mess. What do we get? The answer is a plot that has been pretty much told by the trailers, where one person dies playing the game, leading to her friends trying to uncover the \"mystery\" at hand. Ouija's story is relatively straight and narrow that spends little time on developing any of the characters. Like most horror stories, there is a spiritual entity that has it out for the living,, the reason for it's vengeance also often predictable. In this tale, they have attempted to put a little surprise in the works, but don't be too hopeful, you can easily pick up on it before the big revelation. Despite the little surprise, Ouija starts a lot of things that it doesn't tie up, which left me confused, disappointed, and rather annoyed. The motive for the spirit's hauntings are ambiguous and vague, leading to an ending that left me wanting more movie to get a more complete picture. Putting the shallow story on the side, let's talk about the scares this movie has. For this reviewer there was little scary about the movie. Most of the jump out moments you can see coming a mile away, and the only thing that really scares you is the sudden blaring of music. Sure a few of the screams and creature designs are creepy, but once revealed the effect diminishes within seconds. As for creepiness, the setting is the justifying factor here, with the hidden dangers of the dark smothering you for most of the movie. Those afraid of the dark, or being alone for that matter are going to get a little freaked out. Unfortunately, the ridiculous choices and the lack of common sense take away from the little there is in this movie and makes it more funny than scary. The dramatic build up of scares is very unfulfilling at points, with strange occurrences happening for a few seconds and then nothing. Even the kills in this movie lacked edge, many of which were cheesy and done with in manner of seconds. You heard me seconds, and the problem is that for the most part they are all happening the same way. Such mainstream, dull death gets boring after a while. In addition everything becomes rushed near the end of the movie, diminishing the thrills for a rather hasty conclusion. Oh well at least it's only 90 minutes of our lives right?Perhaps the last thing to discuss about this movie is the actors. Well the biggest strength is that they are all pretty. I like to call this the SyFy syndrome, where the casting grabs the hottest people they can find to give us eye candy. Maybe it's an attempt to distract reviewers from the failings of this movie, or maybe it's a way to give us sweet justice by seeing hot, rich people, fall. Either way your eyes are treated to their beauty, but outside of that there isn't much. They are not bad actors, after all they know how to look and act scared. It's just that there is nothing spectacular about this performance, and it's merely a movie one could have watched on T.V. and been just fine. The exception would be Lin Shaye, who once again dives into the role of a woman bordering on the line of sanity from the horrors she has seen. Shaye's role is very small, but her talents maximize the little screen time she has. Be assured that there will be no Oscars handed out for the performances in this movie, but these stars have great potential for future movies so long as they get better characters. Ouija is not the Halloween hit you might be looking for this season. A rather bland story, scares that fall short, and a rather monochromic cast leads to a recipe for disaster. The movie had potential I think, but there wasn't enough done to really make me terrified at the tale at hand. If you are dying for a Halloween film, I suggest you turn to the Book of Life, or revisit a classic horror film instead. I honestly cannot recommend seeing this film in theaters though. My scores for Ouija are:Horror: 4 Movie Overall: 3.5-4.0",

For such a big production, the writing is often hilarious (for all the wrong reasons) and at times just plain awful - but then again this comes from the same guy who penned the forgettable Boogeyman film and The Knowing starring Ridiculous Cage!The same guy directs, with this being his directorial debut, and as a director of 7 indie features myself, I often wonder how these guys get such a break - then deliver a sub-par film.To be honest, there really is nothing new here at all in regards to horror so I would say skip this and go straight to its prequel, Ouija: Origin of Evil, for a better film!!Ironically, Ouija lacks any spirit...",

Then it took me a while to figure out what kind of film am I watching. But I kind of liked it.In general it's quite an average film. There's nothing extraordinary in acting or directing or any field. But it's decent, and the lead actress is good. What I also liked is the overall pace and style. It's not a gimmicky marathon of jump scares. There's not even that much graphic horror. But the overall atmosphere works. The movie also avoids many cliches and annoyances in this genre. So, the best way to describe the movie is that --it's not annoying--. Even though the characters are teenagers, they aren't the typical annoying brats who you wait to die. Well, maybe still not very memorable characters, but it's a lot that they're not terrible.The negative aspect is that the story is quite typical and nothing special. Every now and then something interesting happens that nails my attention back to the screen, and there are a couple of good twists that I didn't expect. I'm afraid the story has some plot holes but I'm not really interested in thinking it more than this.Overall it's a movie that didn't bore me but when it was over I felt quite indifferent. But I don't get the trend of really negative reviews. I think it's massively better than \"Paranormal Activity\", perhaps a little bit better than \"The Grudge\", but in general still a little bit too average to be really memorable.

Now, he serves as producer of the shallow scary saga \"Ouija,\" a hopelessly predictable movie about the venerable game that Hasbro sells. Indeed, freshman film director and co-writer Stiles White conjures up just enough atmosphere to make your skin shrivel, but then blows it with stereotypical characters who deserve to be in a \"Scary Movie\" outing. This hysterically funny but straight-faced chiller borrows shamelessly from far better movies like \"The Conjuring,\" \"Paranormal Activity,\" and \"Insidious.\" At one point in this generic half-baked hokum, a female character delivers the immortal line: \"Calm down, it's only a game.\" Actually, what she should have said is \"it's only lame.\" Every horror melodrama struggles to exploit something commonplace so it appears creepy, and \"Ouija\" succeeds in this respect. We're told an evil mother stitched her darling daughter's face up and her ghost haunts the attic of the house where our poor heroine resides. Several victims here wind up suffering the same fate as the daughter when they floss their teeth. No sooner have they begun to floss than the floss turns into twine cross stitching their lips. Oh, yes, their eyes turn cloudy, too. Nothing is remotely scary about \"Ouija,\" but some moments will make you shrink in disgust: a cadaverously pale-faced, Gollum like gal scuttles through a shadowy attic and attacks our heroine. The rest of the time this lackluster thriller presents a group of hare-brained teens trying to contact one of their own who hanged herself in the house when she learned that she couldn't incinerate her Ouija board. Naturally, the dead teen's friends break out the old \"Ouija\" board, turn down the lights, slap their fingers on the planchette, and watch where it takes them. Afterward, all you've got to do is take the planchette and squint through the magnifying glass lens, and you can spot a denizen from the spirit world. Stiles relies on quick cuts, loud music, and either people or objects suddenly entering the frame to frighten you. I haven't seen a horror movie this bad in a long time, and I felt like I'd squandered 90 minutes of my life. Save your money; get a flashlight and a mirror, and sit in the dark and scare yourself before you see this schlock for Halloween.",

            "content": "\"Ouija\" is an American 90-minute movie from 2014, so this one has its second anniversary this year. It got some attention recently again as they made a sequel to it. The impact of writer and director Stiles White in this sequel was not as big though, he was the man in charge of this first film we got here. And this one was not really an inspired or creative achievement. It felt like done pretty much by the formula without including any features that make it stand out from the mass of mediocre horror movies. We have a hot girl as the main character, her equally hot female friends and some guy characters who are not strong enough though to stand up to the evil spirit that gets everybody's life in danger and kills some characters from the gang too. But the tiny girl manages to succeed eventually because of her courage, dedication and determination. Been there, seen that.This film is about an Ouija board and this is a subject that was also dealt with many times already in films, so everybody probably roughly knows what to expect here. Some of the Ouija board scenes are pretty cringeworthy, others are solid. When they find out that they have not been talking to their dead friends is one of the best moments of the film, but also one of very few good moments actually. The confrontation at the very end with the evil spirit is not a highlight at all and makes the film seem even more forgettable than it has been in the previous 80 minutes. Judging from this one here, I cannot see why there is any need for a sequel really, but looking at how critics kinda liked this new film and that it was also made by other people than who made this first film, maybe I am a bit too harsh here. I can only judge this one we have here and I am not impressed at all. It was never really scary and this is the main objective for a horror film. Maybe you will be scared if you watch this in a dark theater at night on a huge screen, but otherwise I don't think it is a rewarding watch whatsoever. Acting and script were also fairly mediocre at best. I give it a thumbs-down. Watch something else instead.",

Basically childhood friends Laine Morris (Afra Sophia Tully) and Debbie Galardi (Claire Beale) used to play with an Ouija board, now in the present day, Laine (Olivia Cooke) throws the board in the fire, burning it. However, the board reappears in Debbie's room, she is possessed and hangs herself, Laine and her boyfriend Trevor (Daren Kagasoff), younger sister Sarah (Ana Coto), friend Isabelle (Bianca A. Santos), and Debbie's boyfriend Pete (Douglas Smith) attend her funeral. After the wake, the five friends find the Ouija board, Laine suggests using it communicate with Debbie's spirit, strange things happen during their session, including Pete smashing his head into the mirror. Soon after, the friends start finding the phrase \"hi friend\" (a message communicated during the Ouija board session) written in various places, including in a car window, on a tunnel wall, on a desk and on Laine's computer. Thinking it is Debbie communicating with them, they have another board session, but they realise they have actually come into contact with another spirit of the house. Laine looks through the board's planchette and sees the image of a little girl with her mouth sewn shut, the girl warns her mother is coming, then she sees an old woman, and the group flee. Laine later learns that Debbie found the Ouija board in her attic and played with it alone, then Isabelle is possessed and killed, she smashes her head and cracks her skull open on the bathroom sink. Laine and Pete decide to investigate the house, in the attic they finds photographs belonging to the previous residents, and searching the family history, they find out the little girl, Doris (Sunny May Allison) went missing, her mother was suspected of the disappearance. Laine finds Doris's now elderly sister, Paulina (Insidious's Lin Shaye), committed to a psychiatric hospital, she explains that her mother was a medium, and used Doris's as a vessel for the dead to speak through, the mother went mad, stitched up Doris's mouth, and killed herself. Paulina tells Laine about a secret room in the house, where she must find Doris's hidden body and unstitch her mouth in order to banish the mother. The remaining friends return to the Galardi house, Laine finds the corpse and cuts the mouth stitches, Doris's spirit appears to chase the ghost of the mother away, but shortly after, Pete is possessed and is killed at home, appearing as a ghost with his mouthy sewn shut. Returning to Paulina, Laine realises the old woman intentionally lied, Doris is actually the evil entity, the mother was trying to stop the friends summoning her with the board. The Morris's grandmother, Nona (Vivis Colombetti), advises the sisters destroy Doris's body and the Ouija board at the same time, Trevor is then killed, being possessed and thrown into the swimming pool, filled with plastic wrapping, he is trapped and drowns. Laine and Sarah return to the Galardi house cellar, Sarah is captured by Doris and prepares to sew her mouth shut, but the spirit's attention is drawn by Laine playing with the Ouija board. Doris attempts to possess her, but Debbie's spirit appears, helps save Laine and defeat Doris, her body is thrown into the furnace, and Laine throws the Ouija board. The paranormal activity is over, but in her bedroom, Laine finds the planchette has mysteriously appeared, she looks through its glass hole, the picture fades to black, it is unclear if she saw anything. Also starring Matthew Settle as Mr. Morris, Robyn Lively as Mrs. Galardi, Claudia Katz Minnick as Mother and Morgan Peter Brown as Young Sarah. Everyone has tried having a seance in some way at some point, for fun or for reason, this film is based on the Hasbro \"talking board\" idea, unfortunately it is full of flaws, the contrived shocks are minimal, there is little gore and imagination with the deaths, and the story is predictable, that popular seance question \"is anybody there?\" could easily be aimed at the audience, let's hope the prequel is better, a pretty boring supernatural horror.

The film stars Olivia Cooke, Ana Coto, Daren Kagasoff, Douglas Smith and Bianca A. Santos. Ouija was released on October 24, 2014. It is the first Hasbro property adaptation produced by Platinum Dunes and Blumhouse Productions, as well as Hasbro's first horror film.The film opens with a young Laine Morris and Debbie Galardi playing with a Ouija board in Laine's room, only to be interrupted by Laine's sister Sarah. The scene then forwards to present day, where Debbie (Shelley Hennig) is playing with the board by herself and is so unnerved by what she experiences that she tries to burn the board and planchette before calling Laine (Olivia Cooke). Concerned, Laine comes over but is sent away by Debbie, who goes upstairs only to find the board on her bed. Her eyes turn white and she hangs herself. The following day, Laine is with her boyfriend Trevor (Daren Kagasoff) at a diner, where they meet up with their friend Isabelle (Bianca A. Santos). Laine receives a text and goes home, learning of Debbie's death. After the funeral, Laine finds Debbie's Ouija board and decides to gather Sarah, Trevor, Isabelle, and Debbie's boyfriend Pete (Douglas Smith) to hold a seance. They make contact with someone who is identified as D, who Laine immediately believes is Debbie. Despite this, the group is too frightened to continue playing. A couple nights later, they're drawn back to the board after each person finds the message \"hi friend\" in various locations. Upon further interaction with the board, the group discovers that the spirit is not Debbie. Laine looks through the planchette and sees a young girl with her mouth stitched closed, who then warns the group to run from her mother. The group heads home, only for a malicious spirit to follow Isabelle and murder her. Trevor and Laine research Debbie's house and find that a young girl was placed in a mental institution after killing her mother, who she claims killed her sister, Doris. The two travel to the institution and meet Paulina Zander, who states that their mother killed Doris and sewed her mouth shut because she believed that spirits were trying to communicate through her. Trevor and Laine head home and unleash the spirits of Doris and Mrs. Zander. Doris overcomes her mother and the group believes that everything has been resolved. Unfortunately, this is not true as Pete is later killed by Doris. Laine confronts Paulina about this, only to realize that Doris and Paulina were the evil ones and that Mrs. Zander was trying to stop them. Laine's grandmother tells them that the only way to stop the ghost is to burn Doris's body and the Ouija board. Trevor is also killed before Sarah manages to locate the corpse. Both Sarah and Laine are attacked by Doris and it is only through the intervention of Debbie's spirit that the girls survive and manage to burn Doris's corpse and the Ouija board, destroying Doris. The two sisters return home, only for Laine to find the planchette waiting for her in her room.See This Top Movie With Your Family!. Pity It Is So Under-rated!",

However it doesn't feel like the story moves fast because things continuously got worse, but it didn't drag out so long that I lost interest. This movie played on fears I have a lot (I.e sewing of the mouth) so I was freaked out when I almost never get scared of horror movies. If you walk in expecting this movie to revive the near dead horror genre, you may be disappointed, however with its creepy effects and nice plot twists, it does give the horror genre a pulse once more showing its a hard genre to kill. I enjoyed this movie because I didn't expect the world of it, and I didn't realize it was pg- 13 for the longest. It doesn't have to b rated R to be scary.",

By the one hour point, I was willing the painfully boring ordeal to end.Why is it so ineffective? Well, the story is badly plotted, the characters are one-dimensional, the script is deplorably written, and the acting is weak.

From here it just gets worse, as we have to sit through these worthless characters systematically getting picked off, one by one; but not in any cool \"Final Destination\" way, but in the dullest, least terrifying way imaginable. And then! To top it all off, when it is revealed what is actually behind the murders and the motives, things becomes so oddly confusing, that I felt stupid for trying to follow it. Final Thought: \"Ouija\" has a cameo from that old lady from \"Insidious\"(Lin Shaye) and she sells it for the two scenes she's in. Also, there is one scary scene near the end, which involves a \"monster\" climbing through a vent, which is in fact shockingly well filmed by first time \"director\", Stiles White.

The fact that Ouija boards grew out to become symbol for the macabre, spiritualism and horror is pretty good marketing, if you ask me! As made clear by the title, a Ouija board also forms the central gimmick in this film, but like all skeptical horror fans know, a good gimmick doesn't necessarily guarantee a good movie! \"Ouija\" is an incredibly uninspired, lame and overly sentimental PG13 ghost story that too obviously steals its plot ideas from other films. This could easily be a sequel in the \"Insidious\" franchise, except that the Ouija board replaces the human spiritual medium (but Lin Shaye is still present), while the death sequences could come straight out of a \"Final Destination\" sequel (notably the freak accident in the bathroom). After fooling around with a Ouija board she found in the attic, a teenage girl inexplicable commits suicide. Her friends, and particularly her BFF Layne, refuse to accept that a vivid and joyful young girl like Debbie played with the idea of ending her own life, so they gather around to seek contact with their friend via the same Ouija board. They quickly discover the board is connected to an unresolved missing girl case from the 1950s and put their own lives at risk by unleashing malevolent souls. \"Ouija\" is a strictly by-the-numbers and commercial horror effort, with predictable boo-moments and fake scares at the most foreseeable moments. The teen protagonists are admittedly less stereotypical and annoying than usually the case in this sort of films, but still you don't feel too much empathy for them. The lead girl, Olivia Cooke, is cute and she surely can act, but she's probably also smart enough to realize that her role in the series \"Bates Motel\" is a more valuable addition on her resume. There isn't any gore (duh, PG13) and the make-up effects are weak. My 8-year-old son walked in during one of the supposedly scariest moments, but he wasn't the least bit upset.",

One thing we hear loud and clear is \"never play alone.\"In present time we see Shelley Hennig (of Destrehan, Louisiana) as her friend Debbie Galardi, finding the board in the attic of an old house, and playing alone. Then we learn that she is dead, she seems to have hanger herself. Or did she?The story moves along from there, we see then looking up old newspaper accounts, a mother and her two daughters once lived in that house, the daughter killed the mother back in the 1950s. They believe they still haunt the house.This movie has suitably scary moments if you have a good sound system, and especially if you have a powered subwoofer. On TV or computer speakers, probably not so much. The deep bass makes a real difference in this kind of soundtrack. Not a top-notch movie but a suitably entertaining diversion.

Then the daughter who killed the mom is still living, in an institution. Laine meets her and is told to find a secret room in the basement, find the child's body, and cut the strings over her mouth as the way to free the spirits and dispatch them. They do, in a fairly exciting scene near the end. Plus they thrown the Ouija board into the furnace, along with the remains of the long dead girl.",

This film stars actors Olivia Cook, Daren Kagasoff, Douglas Smith, Bianca A. Sotos, and Shelley Henning. For a movie from the producers of Insidious, I had high expectations for this movie. This movie however, fell fairly short of my expectations. It had its scary moments and times of suspense, but it wasn't as great as many recent horror films.Ouija is not an entirely terrible, it has its moments that had me at the edge of my seat. However, there were lots of other scenes that were just cheesy and clich\u00e9d. It has those typical jump scenes where one of the characters would get attacked by an evil spirit, accompanied by a loud noise, and those scenes never get scary. The movie doesn't really get scary until the end during the climax. The end was probably the best part of the whole movie. Overall, this movie is not bad, it is not good, it's just so-so. If you watch this movie, you just might like it.",

            "content": "There is one trait I find common among modern Hollywood horror movies, a genre that has taken gratifying and progressive steps in recent years: they're always ambitious and have a strong first act, so much so that they tend to end underwhelmingly simply because they can't really cover that much potential that has been promised. This movie is NOT the case!Ouija board is one of the most common props for horror films, so it's only natural that a movie after which is named is centered around a Ouija case. However, although I don't know who really wrote this film, I can honestly say as a viewer, that this could be written by ANYONE! The plot is so appallingly clich\u00e9d and shallow, it would mostly make a Supernatural episode---a mid-season filler, not even one of the better. There is zero creativity in this movie. What's worse? You don't sense any effort, either. How a script so simple could be green-lighted for a feature film is beyond me. I can only assume it's a quick money-grabber to be released on Halloween. And I heard it worked pretty well commercially.None of the other aspects of the film made any attempts to make this movie, if not a good motion picture, but at least an entertaining experience. As we know, bad films can be equally fun to watch, which is especially true in the horror genre. But, again, not this one. The acting is bad, even by horror standards. Character development, well, not bad, BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ANY! So far, my comments can also apply to another 2014 horror film, Anabelle. But that film excelled, at least, in creating an intense atmosphere, great sound effects and some really good scares, even if many are plain shameless jump scares. Ouija, sadly, fails at delivering even the faintest idea of fright, which is the basic idea of horror films. Not even the jump scares are scary here. How the hell do you fail jump scares? Any dude with a hand-held camera can shoot jump scares!!So my conclusion of this film is...exactly the title I employed. There are no redeeming factors. I can't imagine any group of filmwatcher to find this entertaining. Not that my opinion counts for much, but don't even waste your money to rent this.",

Guy gets pushed from behind so hard into a mirror that it shatters, but when asked what happened, he's not even shaken up, that was some of the worst acting I've ever seen.2. I like the little penguin, I'm not sure really what he represents except perhaps the superstitious nature of the main character's mind, and susceptibility to fear driven perceptions, curiosities about the unknown.3. The one white and one black sock on the stairs, yin yang, balance, dark and light... grandma picks up the socks and is the one living in ignorant fear of the board, which I think creates a splintered and unempowered slave mentality, a very real one, because people truly are that way when it comes to Ouija boards. She is also the one who seems to understand the board most, so the socks could represent her grasp on these energies of light and dark. 4. Apparently saying goodbye doesn't have the desired affect.5. The planchette, I liked the idea of the viewfinder, very Conjuring... the speaking the words together reminded me of the movie \"Stay Alive\" which was decent.6. This movie doesn't develop or pace well... the guy looks up an article and its the first thing he looks at, this doesn't help to pull me into the movie... a movie that does the investigation thing better is The Ring by Verbinski.7. Oversaturation of Lin Shaye in today's paranormal horror films... she's in every single one and it's just too much. 8. Spirits without bodies moving through a physical space and touching/abusing people or things is hard to believe... unexplained phenomenon have always eventually led to a logical overlooked explanation out of fear. I know I know, it's just a movie... 9. This movie was profoundly simplistic, and then there's the scene 1 hour and 10 minutes in when the scene shows off the girls boobs in the red dress, I guess that's the boobs in horror they are obligated to give audiences, eh?After that the movie gets even sillier with ghosts shouting possession at people... I mean come on! I wanted to like this movie and you just keep making it harder to do.10. \"You weren't supposed to free her\"... another similarity to The Ring, but one I enjoyed. I like that twist. I wouldn't say the movie is horrible, if I were 12 years old I bet it'd be really scary, but it doesn't offer too much for a deeply thinking, experienced mind. I think there's a great Ouija board movie out there waiting to be made, but we haven't seen it yet.Mediocre film, with a mediocre ending.",

Well, hell to those who say that because this is defiantly one of my new favorite modern scary movies.I gotta say, though, I really wanted to give this a 10/10, but there were a few things that bugged me. One was that in the trailer Sarah (played by Ana Coto) was seen saying \"It's not even real, okay. It's just a game,\" while her voice gets all demonic and her eyes go white. Well, that didn't happen. Well, it did but it didn't. She said something like that but her voice wasn't demonic nor did her eyes go white. Not to mention the countless other things that happened in the trailer but didn't in the movie. (but the thing with Sarah that was so memorable for me personally not being in the movie made me mad for a bit)And that wasn't the only thing that bugged me. The movie left off at a weird spot that makes it need to have a part two. And, if you ask me, the parts that we saw in the trailer that weren't actually in the movie will probably be in part two. (because they need to make one)Now, what if you want to see it but you don't know if it's \"your style\"? Well, let me break this down. If you're the type who loves jump-scares, you'll like this movie. It's packed full of them. You'll even jump at things that you never thought you'd jump at or things that aren't really a threat. If you're the type of person who likes a lot of gore and morbidness, this movie isn't really for you. Sure, this has some morbid parts here and there, especially with the killing of the characters and the design of the antagonist(s(?)), but nothing like a slasher-killer movie. And, if you like movies where you'll have people yelling at how stupid the characters can be *cough**cough*Every Scary Movie Ever*cough**cough* then you'll defiantly like this movie. And, I gotta say, despite it's faults, I love this movie, I'm glad I saw it in thee theater, and I would love to spend my money on it again.Now, if you excuse me, I need to go make plans to see this again.",

            "content": "Ouija, as a film and a concept, embodies why the mainstream horror genre finds itself in such a lackluster position in current times. For one, any remaining originality left in an idea is compromised by writing that not only devotes more to jumpscares. Any shred of suspense or mounting dread is compromised by the screenwriter's and cinematographer's desire to get to the loud, immediate jolt in the music or synthesizers so an impulsive reaction can be contained from the audience. As a result, much like the scare, the audience is given an experience they are unlikely to remember very vividly following the credits.Secondly, there's the element of soiling a material's potential impact by giving it a PG-13 rating. Immediately, veteran movie- lovers and horror fans take note of this stamp as something that caters to the teen demographic, as middle schoolers and high schoolers can now attend the film without a parent or adult guardian. Because this market is included, we can already expect a relatively tame affair that doesn't illicit half of the idea's real potential, and if we consider that this particular idea's potential involves bringing the dead back to life and other demonic occurrences, we can see that quite a lofty amount of potential is sacrificed thanks to this rating.And, finally, there's just the question of the film's existence. Is there a need for another film focusing on several twentysomethings messing around only for them to experience their ugly fate one by one, in a fashion that is unoriginal and without suspense? Certain films of the genre, admittedly, put a creative twist on the subject matter: The Cabin in the Woods offered a mind-bending, subversive quality to well-worn material, Cabin Fever gave us superb woodsy cinematography to look at while giving us delightful practical effects, and even the recent remake of The Town That Dreaded Sundown provided for a pleasant, meta angle to something that could've been a rote, unsatisfying retelling quite easily. Ouija offers no element of creativity in the slightest. It lies dead in the water, providing us with what we expect in depressingly mediocre amounts and giving us a plethora of poorly-drawn, empty teenage vessels (not characters) to spew such perfunctory dialog as \"I think we should stop playing\" and \"Just leave the stupid game alone.\" We, the audience, sit at the mercy of a film only eighty- four minutes in length, asking ourselves if there was some way the board in which the teens play on can emancipate us from the confines of shallow storytelling and completely vapid individuals. Alas, such optimism is foolish and cutesy, as the film persists on in a murky, uninteresting fashion, leaving all hope for any remnant of thought or originality to be almost entirely lost.Even the weaker, less compelling horror films ordinarily include some sort of intriguing element: perhaps the cinematography looks nice, the music is on-point quite frequently, or one or more of the characters is compelling in some way. Ouija is the rare case where it may as well be the cinematic personification of a flat soda left out in the sun in which all of its qualities are thrown into an indistinct pot where they are all muted beyond any form of recognition. I've come a personal ethical quibble with myself on whether or not I should award it points as film for doing that so shockingly, but, if this review hasn't proved it already, I'm getting ahead of myself.Starring: Douglas Smith, Ana Coto, Olivia Cooke, Daren Kagasoff and Bianca Santos.

            "content": "We've all heard the stories about Ouija boards from the internet and urban legends journals and we've probably wondered are they true or just bunk? Naturally, Hollywood has done more than its fair share of building upon these tales by featuring Ouija boards in everything from the horror classic \"The Exorcist\" to 80's fun \"Witchboard\". The latest attempt of this subject by Hollywood is 2014's \"Ouija\". The film centers around a group of teens in mourning after one of their friends seemingly commits suicide, keyword: seemingly. One of their the teens, Laine (Olivia Cook), convinces her friends to investigate things further after they find an Ouija board in their friend's room. Needless to say, they get far more than they bargained for when they come in contact with a dark spirit with evil intentions and are pitted in a battle of life and death. Can they win or they doomed to join their friend on the other side?First let's start with the good. The filmmakers do manage to incorporate a little creepiness in the film's atmosphere by creating a feeling of menace throughout the story as well as a few good, high adrenaline scares here and there. As for performances, in my opinion most of the actors do a fairly decent job in their roles as average teens fooling around with something they shouldn't. Olivia Cook plays the part of the foolishly curious Laine well, as does Ana Coto as her sister, Daren Kagasoff as Trevor, Blanca A. Santos as Isabelle, Douglas Smith as Pete, or Sunny May Allison as Doris. Now the bad: There's not a whole lot we haven't seen before and we get the sense that the film's overall scare factor is watered down. Watching the film, I felt it could have been so much more if the filmmakers had gone a little further in developing the scares and creepiness of the film. Instead, they probably didn't want to make it too scary for the tween and teen crowd, which I can understand up to a point. Bottom line, if you want a popcorn movie to watch with a couple of your friends one night, \"Ouija\" is not the worst way to do it. Just don't expect it to give you nightmares like \"The Exorcist\" or the more recent \"The Conjuring\".",

I absolutely love Olivia Cooke one of my favorite actresses (Love her in Bates Motel, great show) and in Ouija she did not disappoint. The Acting overall was really good and don't let the rating PG-13 fool you, don't judge a book by its cover. Ouija is one creepy scary movie, that would have you jumping out of your seats.

            "content": "PG13 isn't the end of the world for Horror Films. It can be done. But you've got to have a great story and a really good eye behind the camera to get under your skin and use the story and characters to get to you. Ouija has no gore, a few good creepy scenes, but this is something we've seen a dozen times before. There is nothing new here and it just feels like it goes on and on and by the time it wraps up you're just done with the entire idea. The acting is okay and the characters are okay but very vapid with very little development. It is definitely a \"teen\" horror and there isn't anything wrong with that per se but they really don't try to impress. I feel like this was made for a quick cash grab and it was successful at that. It is just a very simple thriller.Olivia Cooke is our scream queen and she's okay given how little she is given to work with. I think she has the right look and I enjoy her on Bates Motel so she could be great but this script gave her little to nothing to go on and the character is so typical that they don't even try to develop the rehashed material. Her friends and fodder for the horror film are so random and barely noticeable that its almost sad for any young actor to be in this. They might be fine actors or might be terrible but Ouija should not be a reflection of them. Ana Coto, Daren Kagasoff, Bianco Santos, Douglas Smith and Shelley Hennig are completely forgettable characters with no depth whatsoever. Somehow they do manage to have chemistry together, they are believable as a close knit group of friends but it doesn't really help anything along. Douglas Smith might be the one small exception as he actually shows some emotional depth with his character as much as he can. Sierra Heuermann is okay as the girl who mysteriously dies. She doesn't get a lot of scenes but she's decent in the few she's in. Go to PG Horror Queen Lin Shaye (who I love) also makes a forced appearance. I say forced because she's cast simply because she made the amazing Insidious so good...Insidious revolutionized the PG13 horror and proved beyond a doubt that you could scare and do it without blood soaking and gratuitous nudity but Ouija tries to ride those coat tails with very little success.Ultimately I don't feel there was any real effort put into this film. They had a script, they knew they could do it on a shoestring and they did and it turned a profit so good for them. But this is far from anything that I would say was \"good\" let alone \"great.\" It was just mildly entertaining...more of a brainless distraction...and everything about it reeks of copying other material and not even copying it well. It doesn't even remotely surprise me that first time director who also co-wrote the screenplay has little experience. They have done special effects before and worked on some great movies but this proves that those talents don't always transition to film maker. Or rather the studio just didn't care and told them to slap something together. At least Ouija doesn't \"look\" cheap so I'll give them that. Its a mainstream film that aims squarely at squealing teenagers at a sleepover. Any horror fan or even thriller fan will find yourself yawning all the way through. Skip it. 5/10",

It's impossible to feel anything but contempt for her, as she annoys her friends and sister and puts everyone in danger for her inane impulses. It would be different if the character were a strongly-written and robustly-portrayed one, but as the focal protagonist, it causes the film to fall apart around her. It's not solely the actress's fault, but she nonetheless does a poor job; there was some material there for her to work with, which she failed to do.The story is just poor all around, though. Not only is it boring, but it doesn't really feel compelling at all. It's difficult to care about any of the characters, and while some of the acting may be poor, it's more a fault of the flaccid script. It's shot like a typical teen drama, but there isn't even the exaggerated angst and nonsense to give at least some laughable amusement, since it's really trying to be a horror movie.It's just not good. The characters and setting don't draw the viewer in, and ultimately it's hard to care with such bland characters and poor portrayals, especially on the part of Laine. A \"talking board\" story could be interesting, even gripping or scary...just not here. Part of what is required for that is for the main character not to be an insufferable ass, and that's true in most horror. If the viewer doesn't care if the character lives or dies or, even worse, actively wishes they'd buy the farm, then the film has failed in its chosen genre.Ouija definitely fails on every respect. It's not even worth B-movie classification. The only good part about it is Robyn Lively, and she's in the movie for about two minutes total. Just watch a better movie: Teen Witch, starring Robyn.

The film tells the story of a group of friends that investigate the shocking death of another friend, after she was recorded using an ancient Oija board. The movie was written and directed by first time feature film director Stiles White and written by White and Juliet Snowden (the duo also co-wrote the 2012 supernatural horror flick 'THE POSSESSION'). It stars Olivia Cooke, Shelley Hennig, Daren Kagasoff, Douglas Smith, Ana Coto, Bianca A. Santos and Lin Shaye. I found the movie to be pretty boring and really, somewhat painfully, dry. Laine (Cooke) and Debbie (Hennig) had been friends since they were little girls; they also experimented with a Oija board, playfully, when they were young. When Debbie is found dead at her house, presumably having hung herself, Laine, and four other friends, investigate what happened to her. They find a video recording of Debbie playing with a really old Oija board and also find the 'spirit board' itself. They then try to use the board to summon the dead, themselves, and find out what happened to Debbie. This of course turns out to be a grave mistake. The movie does have some creepy imagery, and a few good scares, but other than that it's just a complete waste of time. It's so dull it sometimes makes it's 89 minute running time seem like it's hours longer (at least). The acting and directing are really amateurish and the script could have used about a dozen more rewrites. I like and respect horror movies, even the bad ones, but this one isn't even bad in a fun way; it's just boring. Which is one of the worst crimes, I think, a film can commit.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/hS02wz4z3uU",

            "review_title": "I Love the 80s!",
            "content": "They probably only waited 30 years to make this movie since it would probably have been too close to the superior Witchboard. But, still Ouija definitely belongs in the 1980s.Or, it's an homage. Because this movie, step by step, is a 1980s ghost story. Every \"fright,\" twist or solution stemmed from countless movies before it. I will admit to one\u0085ONE\u0085tiny jump scare that I unwillingly participated in, but that was just one tiny shot out of the dozen failed attempts from the movie.Don't get me wrong; I didn't hate this movie. Sure, I wasn't scared in this \"horror\" story, or even involved in any of the characters, stories, subplots or even who lived or died. What I kinda did like was bringing back good memories of when I loved horror \u2013 between the 1970s and 1990s. Ever since then, I cannot name more than maybe five horror movies I truly liked. Lately, it's been 90% or more ghost stories, and I really cannot stand haunted movies.Yes, this is one, too, and yeah, I didn't really like this one much either. Man, I miss slasher movies, or even ones that dealt with physics. But, I'll get to that later.The enormously simple synopsis includes two lifelong BFFs who used to play on a Ouija board as kids, but only one of them broke the rules and played on her own later in life. Suddenly, one-by-one of the small group of friends and relatives are picked off. Sound familiar?All of this should. I am sincerely hoping they were going for homage to the classics of decades past and not simply ripping them all off 30 years too late. Because, if it's the latter, then, again, all of this should be familiar and that can lead to a boring movie since we've seen all of this before.But, heck, it's under an hour and a half, so at least it has that going for it. My recommendation is: If you believe this (in the first 15 minutes of watching it) as homage, carry on. If not, and you think they literally had no shame in stealing, stop and return to Redbox, or stop streaming it, or for the love of all that is living, stop watching it through that little glass circle!* * *Final thoughts: I really, really don't like ghost/haunted house stories. For the most part, they make me crack up; they seriously make me laugh out loud at their silliness. I seem to be in the minority as a ton of my friends and people I've met over my years actually believe in possession, spirits, pictures floating around the room with no explanation. And\u0085that's just it for me. I believe in physics, in real matter. If, what I see on screen isn't what I think could really happen in life, I am not just unafraid, but I think it's humorous. Especially since these ghost stories seem to just make up rules as they go along. I mean, if writing was that simple, I would totally make my love story's main character 45 minutes in suddenly have the ability to fly. Wouldn't that be cool if I could just throw whatever BS at the screen and people will buy it, or at least the people who believe the ghost- nonsense. I digress. I do love horror, and probably my favorite subgenre is the slasher. To name one horror icon I loved growing up was Jason Voorhees. Basically, and for the majority of his movies, he scared me. All I had to do was remove the \"Return from the grave\" opening and play along with the psycho killer in the woods theme. I could turn it in my head as \"this could really happen\" and I would be scared. Turning it back to this movie, Ouija, since I 100% do not believe in ghosts, there is nothing that would ever scare me in these dominating ghost stories as of late.And don't even get me started on the countless, exactly the same and completely hilarious \"Based on True Events\" ghost stories\u0085Those are the absolute funniest.",

Maybe it's just that I expected a lot more from it; especially as it had such great advertising and publicity, however this was a snooze-fest start to end. Even the acting was flat and I cared nothing for any of the characters involved. I definitely have seen worse in terms of budget, concept, etc. but at least they had a certain quirk or charm to them that made them different.

            "content": "The call to the other side is a connection that people have claimed to make for hundreds of years. Though they've never been scientifically proved, they have made something of an impact as there have been reports of people becoming ill and houses that have become mysterious entities. Reports of chairs being stacked and voices coming through electronic devices are among evidence of such bizarre happenings. My childhood friends and I were on opposing teams. Some of us believed in it. Some thought what we heard was nothing but coincidental. Like religion and god, it simply comes down to a matter of faith. Going back to the instruments used in paranormal investigation, the easiest thing people turn to is the Ouija board. Who can blame them as the board can be picked up at any nearby toy store and doesn't require some strange fuel like crystals that one might see at a new age place. All it took was the board, a piece of wood (or plastic these days) and courage to try and talk to the dead. This is something that I never dwelled in and is not nostalgic, but it remains as a nostalgic piece of slumber party memories for most children. Ouija is now the latest of the board games to become movies.Two girls, Debbie (played by Shelley Hennig) and Laine (played by Olivia Cooke) are simply two of the closest high school friends around. They do typical teenager stuff until Debbie starts to hear strange bumps around the house after using an old Ouija board. She's found hung and the police mark this as a suicide, despite never showing any idea of suicidal thoughts. Laine remains grief stricken over her loss and is given the task to house watch while her friends folks are out of town to get away from their loss. Laine along with her friend Trevor (played by Daren Kagasoff) discover the Ouija board that was being used along with some footage from Debbie showing her troubles starting when she played (it's never explained why she did so in the first place which is already confusing). Laine brings her friends back to Debbie's house where by using the board (there's never any other consideration into other objects into contacting spirits), they will try and communicate with their recently deceased. The board seems to work as the teens do feel a presence, but when the thing seems demonic, they think they may have awakened the wrong soul.In my review of Battleship years before, I claimed that Clue remains the best board game adaptation. I still stand by that because Ouija doesn't add much to the reason why we need movies. Presenting a movie out of the spirit board certainly has potential as it has a hundred year history of being used by real paranormal folks. I'm guessing neither of the two writers wanted to bother with that as it was simply easier to do a haunted house story.I have no problem with a haunted house story, but Ouija feels like a movie that was written by the book; that they simply thought of the typical ghost story tropes and then worked in the Ouija board. As far as I'm concerned, the board could have been a painting or a plastic cup and the story would have remained the same. The story itself is not even close to original. Dumb teenagers? Check. Never leaving the haunted place? Check. A false climax further extending the story? Checkmate! What perplexes me is that producer Michael Bay only seems interested in churning out horror movies that may have people coming, but never returning to.I'll give this two Ouija boards out of five. Ouija is something that might be seen as an example of following the book on how to get a script out fast without effort. As far as going back to Ouija, the signs point to no. Let's play Clue next time!",

            "content": "Blumhouse Productions delivers another horror movie......that everyone hates. No shock there. Am I right, or am I right? I knew going into the movie very low expectations were needed to walk away with any enjoyment, but even with my low expectations, I left feeling ripped off. The film is flawed from top to bottom, and one has to wonder why the film was even made, outside of the clear cash grab. The following is my review of Ouija.The film was written by Juliet Snowden and Stiles White(also directed). These two together wrote the 2012 film, The Possession. A film that was also garbage. So none of us should be surprised to see this movie was also trash. The film follows a predicable haunting story. If you want any originality, you will not get that from this film. When you make a story like this, most are going to the theaters for scares. The story never sets any effective scares up over the course of the film. The story is wildly thrown together against a wall. Characters are poorly processed. I understand horror movies mostly have bad character development, but when it is this bad, I am not overlooking it. So bad even that one character just dies with little suspense. So we are left wondering why that character got screen time anyway. My only positive point is that the story moves by rather quickly, mainly because it was meaningless. When a short run time of about 82 minutes, we should all be glad we won't have to suffer that long. This however shouldn't be a plus side for the film. The effort from Snowden and White is very poor, so a huge thumbs down.The film was directed by Stiles White, who also had a hand is writing this trash. This is his first effort directing a film. I won't flat out blast his directing style. I thought it was average at best, but that works in a horror film. No found footage or shaky cam is good in my opinion. Some of the death scenes are rather nice, and look great on screen. While none of the deaths scenes are anything we will remember once the credits roll, credit is due in that aspect. The film uses some jump scares to get people to freak out, but no one was buying these cheap tricks. The door slamming and things being pulled by strings is so played out. The stars of the film are Olivia Cooke, Ana Coto, Daren Kagasoff, Bianca A. Santos, Douglas Smith, and Shelley Hennig. All unknowns to me, which is not a surprise since films like this like to keep the budget low, not having to sign on big stars. The acting is fairly generic. Nothing special, nor nothing over the top awful. Overall, White delivers in only one major area in the directing department. Other than that, this is a huge fail of a film that he decided to direct.The score was composed by Anton Sanko. He works a great deal in the horror genre, and also scored The Possession. While the score is nothing special in this film, it certainly wasn't bad. In some of the more intense horror scenes, the score is fairly well done. For the most part though, the score adds little depth at all. Sanko gets grade a little above average for his score on this film.Overall, the film just is not interesting, nor different from other genre films. There is nothing special to see here, and wasting your time and money on this fail of a film is just not wise at all. Hardcore horror fans such as myself will always rush to see horror films like this. Those on the fence should wait for home video if you do in fact have any interest in this film.2/10",

What A Big Mistake! Everybody knows that nothing good comes out with playing with a Ouija board but when Laine's best friend mysteriously dies, she finds footage of her using the board so she decides to try and connect to her through the board, with her friends. Clever! They then awaken a dark force which begins to make there life hell so they seek help to try and takedown the dark force. To be honest, I totally lost interest in this film once I saw that it was a gullible bunch of teenagers messing with a darker force. The acting isn't that great and the predictable storyline became tedious after a while. The little bit of action towards the end was also a let down, after such a big build up and I really don't know why they just didn't leave the whole board thing alone after the first mysterious death. Anyway, I totally didn't enjoy this film and I can't believe that it made so much money at the box office. Boring & Uninteresting!\u00a0Round-Up: All of the cast in this movie, haven't starred in anything major before this project so I can't really comment on there performance. Its the first movie from director, Stiles White, but he has contributed to many big movies with his writing and special effect skills. From Jurassic Park III, Galaxy Quest, The Sixth Sense, Interview With A Vampire and the Ghost in the Darkness, we have all enjoyed his special effects at some point and he has also written the Possession and Knowing, which weren't that great. With such a big profit at the box office, I'm sure were going to be seeing Ouija II soon but I personally won't be rushing to see it. My expectations for the movie wasn't that high so I wasn't that surprised with the outcome. It also didn't go down well with the critics which is why I'm so surprised with the box office takings. There's obviously still an audience for this type of movie but I still find it quite hard to take them seriously.\u00a0Budget: $5million Worldwide Gross: $102.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their supernatural, horror movies about a group of friends who try and connect to there dead friend through a Ouija board. 2/10",

I think the people behind this film must be lazy AND stupid. This is what often happens when directors fancy themselves as writers and pay their chums to write a screenplay with them.The actors don't seem to believe their own reactions, which become more and more flat as the film progresses. Laine in particular appears less and less engaged and interested in the increasingly incredulous scenes. Maybe she took up the use of mind-numbing sedatives to blunt her increasingly desperate self questioning of \"Why oh why did I sign up for this joke of a film?!\" Well, the director and writers obviously didn't care about the film, so why should they? \"Is there a presence here?\" they ask the Ouija board, while trying their best exude as little presence as possible themselves, silently hoping that their low impact approach to acting will make them invisible enough, so that people will forget that they were ever associated with this crime against film. The characters have no individual characteristics to the point of being hollow. The dialogue is so shallow and unrealistic that it made me laugh out loud and never allowed me to get immersed into the story. A good film IMO has a solid story delivered by decent actors, and makes me forget that it's a film. Ouija with its repetitive, inconsistent plot twists, parades a sign of \"I AM A (BAD) FILM\" in every scene. It's as if the \"writers\" were following a bad screenplay guidebook, hell-bent on using every rookie technique ever invented. Characters state the obvious, they say things that sound unnatural just to reveal information to viewers in a vague attempt of back story and they are suddenly experts on certain things. Without any explanation, Laine is suddenly sure that \"Mother is angry\". When Laine and Debbies bf find pictures of the people who used to live in Debbie's house, Laine's bf stiffly proclaims: \"Judging by these pictures, they were taken in the late 40's, early 50's\". Lol, who talks like that?! Certainly not a leather jacket wearing teenage college student, who is apparently also illiterate, because he has to call Laine over to read aloud the article he found about these previous tenants (an article which of course was the first one he found immediately on typing the words into the search engine of his laptop). And mental granny offers no logical reason for her advice of cutting the stitches off DZ's mouth in order to drive away the evil spirit. The highlight of stupidity is when Debbie's spirit appears in the final spirit battle, complete with triumphant background violins.The trailer resorts to false advertising to trick punters into wasting their time and money on this children's film, which shouldn't be allowed to be categorized as horror.

Teens conjuring up evil spirits? Teens being picked off one by one? Secret rooms? A visit to a mental institution? Been there, done that. When the movie is not familiar, it often doesn't make sense. (For example, why did the teens leave the mummified body in the secret room instead of calling the authorities to report it?) The biggest flaw concerning the movie is that it just isn't very scary or spooky. It's mighty slow to set the situation up, and the \"scares\" have that \"been there done that\" feeling I talked about earlier. To be fair, the teenage protagonists are somewhat more palatable than you usually get in horror movies, and the movie looks pretty good for what was just a five million dollar budget. But if you've seen your share of horror movies, there's a good chance you'll find very little that's new here. I've heard rumblings from Hollywood that they are making a sequel to this movie.

They discover exactly what happened to their friend themselves...This movie is directed by Stiles White in his directorial debut and stars Olivia Cooke (Ready Player One), Ana Coto (Can't Take it Back), Daren Kagasoff (Red Band Society), Bianca A. Santos (Priceless) and Douglas Smith (The Alienist).The storyline for this is pretty straightforward and often cliche. Looking through the letter finder was a nice touch. The horror elements are uneven. There are a few good jump scares but the white eyes and levitation scenes weren't as scary as intended. The cast, acting and script is fairly mediocre and everything about this movie felt very average.Overall this is a fairly mediocre addition to the horror genre. The sequel is much better.

Instead of contacting Debbie, they find someone else. Now she and her friends must discover this spirit's past and to close the portal they've opened in order for them to not suffer its fateWhen I heard about this film near the end of last year, I thought it had a lot of potential based on the subject matter. But it turned out to be a vanilla/PG-13 (I use these terms interchangeably) horror movie. If you think watching people sit at a table is exciting, than this film is for you. I just wished it could have gone further in many areas. I personally did not find this film very scary which disappointed me but I was not surprised considering what I knew about the film. This is what happens when the film is marketed for a YA/tween audience. I guess it didn't want to alienate them. I think they are better than that. I found the story rather predictable where I was able to guess what happened next most of the time. I also found that the film skimmed over a few things story-wise which meant just having to accept things that are thrown at you and it suffers from many underdeveloped characters such as all of them. I never really cared about any of the characters so I wasn't too emotionally invested in them either. In my opinion, good horror movie have a few characters that are developed to the point that you become emotionally invested and care about what happens to them so we get scared with them because we believe that something bad is about to happen to them. They also have characters that we tend to not care as much about because they need people to kill off. I never got to learn too much about any of the characters so I didn't care about what happened to them and I will not spoil what happens but I will say that it did not do enough. Also the film was too short in that another 15 minutes could have done it some good. The end was pointless because it tried to hint at a sequel which is unnecessary and will probably not happen judging by how poorly the film did at the box office. Its a shame that the film was marketed to a younger audience because if it could have gone a little darker and dived a little deeper into the subject matter then the film could have been decent.Score: 6/10 keithlovesmovies.com",

None of them show any sort of hesitation. That is not realistic since at least one of them would maybe hesitate and back off from the whole idea. But this is Hollywood movie world and apparently they need to go ahead fearlessly in order to be proved wrong.I am ranking it higher than most people. I did feel that there is some creepy atmosphere at various points. The movie starts with a bang and that sets the tone for the rest of the movie. It has the usual James wan-like jump scares but it doesn't overdo it. Unlike maybe some other recent horror movies. Towards the end, it does start to get more frenetic. But still there were some good scenes. Like that scene with Debbie (or Doris)! But the story is nothing new and the twist (if you can call it that) can be seen a mile away.I was surprised by the fact that some of the scenes in the trailer did not appear in the movie. Supposedly a couple of scenes were removed. One of the scenes in the trailer was actually pretty good, I kept waiting for that scene and it never appeared. That could have raised the rating a bit. The ending is not so bad but maybe the victory was too easy. The last shot was a little irritating but this is now common in all horror movies.It seems Lin shaye has to appear in pretty much every horror movie nowadays and her role is not too bad as well. But maybe she could have been there longer. Olivia cooke is gorgeous but I found her character's decisions to be pretty strange.Overall I did enjoy it but was bothered by the unoriginality. There is no doubt that the ouija board genre has maybe reached its limit and they need to quit making movies about this. This movie shows the shortage of ideas in the genre.",

Beyond that, this movie carries some pretty poor acting (minus the lead who seemed to actually care to try at times) and the scares were way to few and far between to sucker in a horror fan. The actual camera work to me stood out since the few scares were set up well, but this movie as a whole is kind of what the problem is with horror movies lately. The formula is there, seems plain to most, but to excel you need to step out of the box with something to stand out. This movie just doesn't do that. Will you be mad for watching it?

I have never used it but some of my friends with a taste for these themes have used it or know it well enough to ensure that its not a good idea to use it. Here, in Portugal, its better known as \"Jogo do Copo\" (literally Game of the Glass, because the triangular pointer is often swapped for a glass cup that has to be broken after the game). Basically, my friends told me that any spirit or demon can answer the call and deceive the players, and the board is the source of several possessions or supernatural disturbances. I don't know if that's true, I'm telling what I've been told, but I will not pay to see if it's true or not. As the people use to say here, \"prudent man has died old and suspicious man is still alive\". But let's talk about the movie, that's what matters.The film begins with a good horror premise: an Ouija board that is at the origin of the mysterious death of a young woman. The problem is that the whole plot that develops later is of an awful predictability. In terms of scares, the film also fails roundly. Neither the usual sound and visual tricks were able to make me jump from the seat because I was able to foresee them. The tension, usually compulsory in a horror film, is so absent that it can make us fall asleep. The characters are empty, devoid of personality or some feature that makes us like them, and that makes it indifferent whether they live or die. Some are truly stupid and we just don't care about them. The cast is composed of actors with no talent or experience, who deliver wooden performances, unrealistic and without remarkable merit. Finally, its necessary to talk about CGI, visual and sound effects: although the movie is visually regular, the computer effects are very boring and low, probably because of the low budget.",

So if you're going to have a slow burning period in your film you have to be very crafty about it like 'Paranormal Activity' was able to be. Very few films are capable of pulling this off though and 'Ouija' is certainly not one of them, and yet the first 30-40 minutes play more like a drama than anything. The opening scene that is meant to set the tone for the movie and have audiences on edge from the word go is terribly done, with no tension whatsoever built due to it being so rushed. You have to see it with your own eye (no pun intended) to understand just how poorly this scene is directed. It really does defy belief in this day and age of filmmaking.So the film wasn't off to a great start. Finally things started to happen - but they didn't make sense. The characters were certain playing the Ouija board was the only thing to do, yet as soon as it actually moved they were sure it must have been someone else in the circle playing a prank. Not to mention the clich\u00e9 that accusation is, it simply didn't make sense to ask that. Poor writing. Then more death scenes that were just rushed to an unbelievable degree. They had all the patience with the dialogue in scene after scene but as soon as some violence starts up, it's rush, rush, rush. Newsflash: this is what we are here for! I can only wonder whether this was done to keep the rating down. Very disappointing whatever the reason.The final third of the film is definitely its strong point and saves it from being a complete misfire. There are some decent scares and while the writing remains atrocious (never once did contacting the police cross their minds?) at least we're finally getting a little bit of what we came for. Personally I think the movie was doomed to fail before it even began production, because Ouija boards in the modern day just aren't considered scary to any one with half a brain. Nevertheless the film was a box office success and I'm led to believe a sequel is on the way. Hopefully they learn from their mistakes in the first one and give us a good ride the second time around.",

One point for Shaye just being in the film (God damn love her), one point for Cooke attempting to save this disaster with some genuine decent acting and the last point for the spirit demon girl crawling through the ventilation tunnel faster than Sonic the Hedgehog (na-uh, no thank you).

A haunted board game just isn't scary. Setting up the rules and explaining how the game works just adds to its absurdity and wastes precious time that could be better utilised in actually developing a coherent plot. The friends can't act. The ouija board has more personality than them. Damn. Their purpose is just to be expendable as the demon spirit stitches their mouths together. Oh, but don't worry. You never actually see it.

In the context of fierce competition in the form of Paranormal Activity and the like, Ouija should have spent time crafting not only a more engaging plot, but also a few more original, memorable scares. As it is, we are scarcely able to recommend this movie for even those nights of desperate boredom.",

            "content": "A dull, lifeless, and forgettable mess- Ouija proves to be nothing more than an abundance of cliches and previously done callbacks to other and better horror flicks. This film is quite honestly worse than I expected it to be, and I had rather low expectations. I wanted to like it, I wanted to give it a chance, put those bad reviews to the side. But there is no doubt that this is a bad film, and there is really nothing redeemable about it. The one thing I liked about this film, is Lin Shaye. Granted, she doesn't show up until like an hour into the movie and is barely in the film to begin with, but her performance is really the only good thing about the film, as she flat out nails her role. The other actors in the film are exactly how you expect them to be, wooden teenager archetypes with nothing to do but be murdered one after another. Its a plot and situation you have seen in horror flicks dozens of times before, and honestly, the film just shows how stale these tropes are truly getting. On top of that, the dialogue and script is atrocious, and incredibly predictable. I had an idea of how the film would go after the opening scene, and it went exactly as I thought it would, which is, at the very least to say, a shame. Besides the horrible dialogue and writing, the film also seems quite generic and seems to take much from other horror flicks of this nature- surprisingly a lot from the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. If you pay close enough attention, you can see just how similar a lot of the visuals, scenery, and setting is to those films, and it is quite painful to see that they couldn't even think of an original style for this film, let alone a story, direction, or script. In the end, Ouija is best left in the basement alone and dusty where it belongs, and truly offers a question as to what lengths Hollywood will go to for a simple buck today.\nMy Rating: 2.75/10",

When I finally seen them, it makes them a lot more scarier, because there was build up and hype to seeing it. This is definitely not one of those movies. It was Boring and bland.

Little do they know, that it's something far more sinister than that & start being haunted by some demonic presence who will stop at nothing to kill them all!I found the film to be pretty good! As I said, I really don't get the hateful reviews, not to mention the overwhelming hate this film gets generally! It's like as soon as you mention this Film, you get a sort of knee jerk reaction of immediate hate with this film! Alright, it's not original, but come on, what is in this day & age!? And can you do any better!?The story is simple, but who cares!? The films visuals, scares & sinister feel really add to the creepy atmosphere! There's plenty of jump scares in this film also to keep you on edge! Along with some eye candy to keep you going, this is a 86 Minute Spooky Ride you won't want to miss!Overall, it's a great film that gets far too much hate! There's worse films out there & this isn't one of them! Having seen Ouija: Origin Of Evil, I can say it's also as good as this film, but wouldn't say it's better or worse! I like this film for its scare factor, visuals & sinister feel! Ignore the hateful reviews & go watch this epic horror film!9/10.",

Every moment I spent watching it was a waste but I couldn't stop. Why? I thought to myself; \"it can't be that bad, right? There must be something original about it if It didn't get sued for plagiarism by now\". When I gave it a bit more thought, I concluded that the s**t movies they copied didn't probably even make enough money off it to sue anyone! For the love of the gods, I even predicted Debbie returning for those 5 seconds to save her friend at the end. So to sum it up, if you value your time, don't be like me and watch the movie.

            "content": "The most amazing thing about this movie is that one of the production companies is the toy company Hasbro, who manufactures the Ouija board. I find it funny and interesting that they use the movie to push their product... something that will contact the dead and will probably cause your gruesome death.This is an enjoyable, though a pretty basic, horror movie. Best friends, Laine and Debbie, play with the Ouija as children obeying the rules that they should be courteous and never play alone. Years later, Debbie uses the board by herself and strange things start to happen, which results in her growing distant from her friends and boyfriend. Using the ouija in solitary leads to her violent death.Laine agrees to house sit for Debbies distraught parents after the funeral as they need to get away. She realises the board had a part to play in her friend's death so rallies the others to help here prove the idea. Of course, this is a bad idea and the spirit they contact starts to plague them in their lives. From here on in, it's a race to save themselves and to solve the mystery of the origin of the board.There's nothing really new in this film that hasn't been covered before. The acting of the entire cast is above average and makes the film enjoyable to watch, as is the direction from Stiles White, who co-wrote the story with Juliet Snowden. Since this is a Blumhouse production there's a cameo from Lin Shaye, who, as always is good in her role (though I will always remember her as the landlady in Kingpin).This is one of those films that's worth watching if it comes onto telly and there's nothing better on. At least worth watching once, though I don't think I'll watch it again... though I will watch the sequel when it's on or if I can borrow it from friends.",

If there isn't a thoroughly thought-out movie backing up the title then the weight of criticism these days would probably sink your life for a while. But They is a fantastic movie, full of chills and jump scares, great tension and exciting moments with tasteful, terrifying effects. I'm happy to report that Ouija is equally good. It's a highly intelligent and well thought out movie. There are many, many carefully chosen scenes that are absolutely classic. When I saw the low score for this movie I honestly got a shock. I think that young people these days have a skewed version of what is cool for them, which is rooted in social media trends and the similar consequent weight of historical opinion. Maybe these days a movie has to imitate something classic from the past to make the grade? Whatever. For me, Ouija was a brilliantly cast movie. The actors were engaging, and contrary to a lot of late teen movies they acted normally and there wasn't any sign of exaggerated bickering. The movie was also sweet in its secondary premise, that of sisters. The effects were really well timed, not over used, really effective and entertaining. I note that several of these actors have gone on to play major roles. You just can't get around the fact that a brave filmmaker has now made a really good movie titled \"Ouija\" and come out the other side, totally unsunk.",

Laine found the old owners' photos at the attic after learning that Debbie found the board at the attic. There was a woman and two daughters. One of them was missing and the other was still alive and institutionalized at a psychiatric hospital. Laine visited her and she said her mother was practicing mediumship and using her sister as a conduit and she snapped and killed her sister by stitching her mouth shut. Laine found the body in the secret room down in the cellar. She removed the stitches from her mouth and she sent the mother away. But the killings didn't stop because the sister was lying. It was the girl who was evil and the mother was warning them. They burnt the board and the dead body of the girl in the basement and dark souls released. But they forgot the planchette and Laine held the planchette and looked thru the glass and the film ended there.

The general feel & look of the movie says \"teeny horror\" but thankfully that isn't as bad as it sounds here.The story, while not the most imaginative, isn't all that bad but beware - it is rather predictable and full of horror clich\u00e9's. You have the predictable twist; the predictable \"jump scares\" (some of which aren't too bad to be honest); the main cast of characters acting in their usual predictable manner. There's definitely nothing original with this story so if you're hoping for a wee bit of that then you're out of luck here.The film takes a wee bit of time to get going as well, and doesn't really start picking up until about halfway through. I know that films can't dive straight in within the first 5 minutes, but there's too many stop/start moments within the first 45-50 minutes or so. It builds you up just to let you down, and it's the last 30 minutes or so that saves the movie from completely flopping in my eyes as this is where the majority of the action takes place.The scares in the movie are the old fashioned \"jump scares\" and as I mentioned earlier, some aren't too bad with the odd mildly decent freaky moment here & there (a younger audience will probably feel the effect more though), but you do get used to them very early on so they don't really come as a surprise as much as the movie goes on.The film cast is pretty average, but Lin Shaye is the highlight for me, and even though she's only in the movie for about 10-15 minutes she's as good here as she was in Insidious.Ouija isn't an awful movie by any means, but it definitely isn't the best either.",

No surprise there, but this is easily the weakest horror film from Blumhouse Productions in quite a while.This supernatural horror is boring, it's an easy word to throw at a movie title but it genuinely is a bore to watch, especially seeing as most the characters here are paper thin and undeveloped. However, I will admire the fact that Ouija doesn't stick to the staple clich\u00e9 horror characters like the usual cocky guy, the hot dumb girl and the black guy who bites the dust pretty quickly. Instead we are introduced to a bunch of close friends suffering from the loss of their friend after a supposed suicide, but none of them are memorable or feature interesting motives or traits. The scares are un-inventive and tame, eliciting only a minor shudder from me that leave no chills. A lot of the scenes are set during the day, all of Ouija is too bright and upbeat so when the night finally descends there's no element of creepiness or danger and peril for the characters. There are countless horrors with sequences set in broad daylight that terrify me, check out \"The Pact\", \"The Conjuring\" or \"Insidious 2\" for real daytime scares. Director Stiles White lends a finely polished product with some lovely still shots but fails to construct unease, his strongest moment sees the group of teens finally make contact with the entity that has reached out to them, I admit my hairs on my arms and neck stood up for a small amount of time, but then cheap jump scares creep in, ruining the atmosphere immediately.Olivia Cooke is easily the lone bright spot, her performance is a great mixture of fear, sadness, confusion and motivation, this Manchester born Brit actress is on her way to greater things, she's better than Ouija, as is Shelley Hennig who despite having less screen- time is convincing enough as a girl haunted by evil. Lin Shaye makes a welcome appearance that sees her ditch the ghost hunting confidence from the \"Insidious\" films to play a more vulnerable and innocent role.A few performances and well shot sequences aside, Ouija is hard to recommend, the ending is ridiculously silly and completely adds a campy tone to an already dull and overly serious horror that sits at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to scare tactics.",

Believable acting, as well as original camera set ups, atmospheric lighting backed up by a eerie sound and music design. But most of all the antagonist that has to have some truly frightening quality about him or her. Every decade has it's super villains. In 80's we had Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees. Michael Myers. In 90's the horror genre had \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\", \"It\", \"Scream\" franchise, and by the end of 90's\"The Blair Witch Project\" that started the whole found footage phenomenon which basically continued through 2000's with \"Paranormal Activity\", \"The Ring\", \"The Grudge\" and \"The Others\", etc. 2010 started with an impressive and in my opinion one of the greatest horror movies of all time \"Insidious\" and continued with couple of descend horrors like \"The Conjuring\" and very good \"The Cabin in the Woods\". Specially \"Insidious\" proved that you don't have to have gigantic budget to create an frightening atmospheric horror and sometime lack of a big budget forces the filmmakers to be extra imaginative in their creation. \"Ouija\" is based in some way on a gimmick of using ouija board as a medium of communication between world of spirit and matter. It is always dangerous to create movie based on a concept alone and \"Ouija\" oozes of one dimensionality. \"A group of friends must confront their most terrifying fears when they awaken the dark powers of an ancient spirit board.\"This American remake of Filipino horror movie feels like a cheap student movie that got opportunity do be elevated to a mainstream Hollywood production. The actors do a decent job to maintain our interest in the script written by numbers but the story feels so predictable that after a while we are easily able to predict what will happen next and to not give it away to much, it all comes down to a consequence of what happens when you mingle with dark forces. The actors are all attractive which in someway, I suppose were casted to distract us form predictable story. But I can see them getting more work and better acting challenges which this film did not offer.The only redeeming part in this otherwise mediocre production is presence of Lin Shaye who slowly becoming a queen of horror movies. Her supporting role steals the movie in terms of believability and she is literally in 3 scenes which end up being the most reach in characterization and believability. Her supporting role might be the only reason to see this otherwise mediocre movie. The only reason why I did not give \"Ouija\" one star is a presence of Lin Shaye so that tells you what to expect.For more of my movie reviews go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",

There were few interactions with adults and the film focused on high schoolers almost exclusively. The second movie was better made and far more creepy and psychologically disturbing. This movie did tie into the other story and if seen after made more sense. I see a lot of horror movies and there are so many that fall below average range for acting quality or storyline. I didn't feel this one was poorly crafted or acted, the characters just weren't very developed and the plot was too disjointed. But they did have a few 'scares' in the mix.",

But to not ever see a movie about focusing on what could go wrong by this spirit board, it was more about surprises and jumps then the actual main story which is a spirit called out by the board. It had the potential but the directing and story line just didn't cut it. It seemed rush considering like any other horror movie, people are picked off one by one. I would've liked to see a better understanding of the spirit called \"The Mother\" and the victim which starts out at the movie, Debby. It seems like there was just not enough connections to make a better story and at times it made me mad when the only answer was to play the Ouija board.",

This film is so formulaic with clich\u00e9' in almost every single scene and you can easily guess this is produced by Michael Bay (again). The major problem is the plot here that's so dull, lazy, and dumb with characters that don't seem to have enough empathy for others while still pretending that they do. While most of the SCARE here comes from the annoyingly loud jumpy sounds but the ghost feature does look frightening in a few scenes, but that's all the film has to offer. As this film is rated PG-13, there are some violence but nothing GORY or anything. Overall, this is a lazy, loud, dumb, and dull horror film that will probably amuses to those who have never seen any horror films in their lives before.>>D+<<",

The only thing that I was wondering is how a ghost from the 40ies comes to know how to operate a computer ;-). And I did not like the clich\u00e9d ending (I cannot imagine them forgetting to burn this piece and if they did burn it, how come it is back??).

They soon decide to communicate with the dead girl using an Ouija board. However, they realize that the spirit board has awoken some dark spirits, threatening to end their lives. Ouija is yet another boring, uninteresting, generic mess of a horror movie that falls apart the moment you give it any thought. More importantly the movie is just not scary, it is all a collection of jump scares.Full Review:After the abomination that was Annabelle, I really wanted a movie that would redeem the horror genre this Halloween season. I quickly realized I chose the wrong film.Let's skim over the few positives the movie does have. Overall Ouija is well shot, there are no lazy framing. As a result the \"scares\" do come unpredictably, so kudos for that. The concept of a haunted Ouija board is intriguing. If you ever played it before it's bound to bring back some memories, which it did for me from my childhood (been 14 years and I still hate my friend for scaring and fooling us all!). So the first few Ouija board scenes were effective for the creep factor.The negatives however far overshadow the positives. In my Quickie Review, I was being generous with the plot synopsis. In reality the synopsis should be: A group of generic high school stereotypes play with a spirit board, and in between those scenes they talk about the spirit board, the end. The story is just boring, and it is clear that even the filmmakers felt that because there is a twist in this film that is simply forced in. This is not some assumption, it is a fact that they had re-shoots for this movie. Perhaps this twist was supposed to be some shocking revelation to make Ouija interesting. Instead the whole story logic just falls apart at its foundation. I don't do spoilers in my reviews so I won't say it, but really, read or watch other spoiler reviews and you'll know exactly what I mean. Honestly it is insulting how dim-witted the writers must think we are. It's as if the filmmakers really think we would accept these half-assed attempts at movies. A single neuron could figure out that the plot makes no sense.I sat down to write this review and the first thing I did was palm my face. Ouija made my hobby of writing about movies feels like work, that's when I truly know I hated the movie. Generic characters, generic scares, generic ghost deaths, just generic. I just looked up the definition of generic in the Oxford Dictionary and it says, \"a 2014 film called Ouija.\"Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",

At no time during the length of the film did I even care about what happens to the main characters, whether they live or die or whatever. The plot is full of holes.

From the minute it started it was incredibly boring, predictive and just cheap looking. Terrible story line, actors must have been picked up from a secondary school performance art classes as it was poor. The whole film was not scary at all, and I managed to nod off for 5 minutes as there was no tension what so ever, nothing encouraging you to stay focused and watch it paying loads of attention. In my eyes I just wasted my time, good job my cinema tickets were free otherwise I'd be fuming for spending \u00a39 on this terrible production.Over all, another low budget production with shocking special effects, (some guys on youtube make better animations)",

            "content": "Ouija is a movie based on the famous Ouija Board \"game\". When Laine Morris discovers the death of her best friend Debbie she is going to visit the house. In the house she finds a board. An Ouija Board. She and her friends still can't believe why Debbie died. Laine will try to convince her friends to use this board to contact Debbie because she can't let her go yet. When she convinced her friends she is going to play at the house where Debbie died. And when they start playing they think they are connected with Debbie. But later on they figured out they were tricked on connected to an evil spirit.A lot of bad reviews have been written already about these film which I partly understood. When you make a film about the famous game Ouija than you have a lot of opportunities with it. This film however never really took those opportunity's. The problem with this film only is the script and part of the actors.The first part of the film- before the break- wasn't so bad when you just look at the storyline. It started interesting with this girl who lost her best friend because of the game. And she wants to know what really happens. That is in fact what they wanted to achieve in the beginning of this film. But after the break we get to see walking skeletons which I didn't like at all. But the biggest problem was, I think, was that the evil spirit who was behind these kids changed too many times. Firstly they said it was \" The Mother\" and later it was her child. And that was the problem because you have to keep the audience watching, they have to stay interested throughout the whole film. And with these changes in the film it didn't make it really good. Though, of course the background story of the family who ones lived there was good. It gave a sort of development to the story which we hadn't seen in the film yet. But it was used in a wrong way.I always love to see when young unexperienced get a chance to prove themselves. And sometimes you see they do incredible things sometimes on a very young age. But sometimes it makes you hate the film because the choice of casting wasn't good. In this film I've seen three people in the casting who did a good job as playing their character. I loved the performance of Olivia Cooke, she shows in this film that she can play the lead role very good. Maybe one of the few things that were good about the film. I also liked the performance of Shelley Hennig who played Debbie, I think she did a good job playing a character who was so excited about this game and just didn't saw the danger of it. It was very nice to see Lin Shaye in this film as a very different character as she does in Insidious. I liked her performance. But the remaining cast didn't really convinced me very well.This film has scary moments but actually during the whole film and it is sometimes the same scary moment as they used earlier in the film, which makes it sometimes predictable. I rate this film 4/10; Olivia Cooke, Shelley Hennig and Lin Shaye saved this film from a lower rate, their performance was great. But the beginning of the film was just good- it started really well.

But, you expect more suspense and creepy ambiance from a ghost film, and Ouija just becomes another predictable vengeful spirit affair (with a bit of Final Destination chucked in for good measure - just without the invention and imagination of those movies), and a turgid one at that. As such, the pacing is slow, and the feeling evoked in the viewer is apt for a movie about the dead as it is totally lifeless. In the final analysis then, Ouija is a dull film and should be retitled Nonnein.",

The spirit takes control of her body and kills her. Then her friends wants to contact her (although the reasons, other than: 'I can't accept the fact she is death' are unclear) through the board. Of course this goes wrong and there are more spirits in the house. But nothing shocking happens throughout the movie. Some words spelled towards each of the friends, a few doors that are moving and like I said, even the deaths weren't that great. Of course it has a plot twist, but it's something you could've figured out by yourself. Just don't see the movie, it's not worth your time.

            "content": "Ouija (2014) has an interesting premise, mostly everyone has heard of the Ouija board. There are really good points in this film, but overall it fails as a horror movie. It has too many jump scares, these can be used in a clever way (paranormal activity etc) but in this movie its like \"oh again really??\" after you watch the first 2 scares you know what's coming. Lin Shaye deserves a big nod I really love her and the movies she chooses to be in. Another mention should go to the sexy best friend I forget her name now but she was good too. Other than that the acting and performances were average at best. It is a shame that Hasbro and the production company lost funding while making the movie because it could have been a lot better in the effects department too. If I did have a couple of other things I would say about Ouija is that it did not explore demonology enough, although this was explored in a previous movie called ZoZo this movie was awful in comparison to Ouija but at least it explored reality in regards to the Ouija board. Another thing is that it could have had a disclaimer at the beginning of this film to explain that the board is not really a toy, considering Hasbro has had the rights to the Ouija board for decades and distribute it as a toy they do not say this enough and then bad things happen. Whether you believe in them or not though I would say that overall Ouija (2014) is a fun Halloween/horror movie but there is not much in the film that will keep people talking about it in years to come, although it does keep your interest throughout. It is nice to see the Ouija gaining some popularity again in the mainstream :-)6* out of 10Greg - Spiritual Counselling UK",

I am happy to announce that I was right to the very last scene.The plot is way too predictable right from the title screen.I mean come on! Who could not predict the plot simply by the name Ouija? Bunch of teens trying to play the board and ends up getting caught up in a really twisted fate and meanwhile side characters gets all killed. In the end only the main star stands breathing while everybody else have been killed off brutally. See downright predictable and almost nothing new at least in terms of plot.The horror in the movie is created by sudden pop of ghosts, shadows and lights. But do they manage to create an effect? Yes. At times. But not always. The plot tried its hand at being a little suspenseful towards the end but I felt it was too hasty and kind of \"obvious plot turn\"Character wise, I felt like barging into the screen and beating the central character, (Laine Morris played by Olivia Cooke) till she turned blue or start using brains. You will understand my feeling once you watch the movie.for the time being let's just say that the character is the reason why trouble gets started in the first place.I m talking for the character not the actor. Actors can't be blamed for a plot that had nothing to work around. Everybody kind of did their best to look scared and being chased by ghosts.While it is not exactly a painful watch it is not that impressive too.At the end if you want to watch it, you could, as far as you are not expecting to be scared out of your body. You could actually use to it play \"guess what happens next\".

While watching the house strange things start to happen and she finds a ouija board and decides to gather some friends to try and talk to their recently dead friend.

Then the question is who or what is the spirit that is interacting with them, as the warnings with ouija boards go you open a door to anything and everything. So the search begins for where that board comes from and the history behind it and the identity of the spirit, which is similar to the plot of The Ring. It's good because there is a bit of mystery that keeps you a bit on edge and unlike Poltergiest's cheap random cop out of oh there is a burial ground here, the ending here is organic to the movie, you don't see it coming in the first 5 minutes but it isn't for way out of left field it develops as the movie plays out.",

It starts out like any horror film, very beginning is the set up scene to let watchers see a brief reason for the rest of the film. Now the building of characters was decent, the best friend, lead actress distraught and seeking an answer of why the tragedy happened, hen the rebellious sister, the boyfriend,and the party chick friend. Very typical high school cast of characters that is perfect for the film. Now starting out this film looks,and feels very promising, but that is not the case, the writer and director had all the tools for a good horror film,but didn't use enough of it. People wanted to see more of a \"beyond\" \" afterlife\" feel of the film while \"trying to contact the dead\" . Instead what you get is detective work, with very few scares until the final scene, which really isn't even scary, just a screaming woman ghost, then. It's over. People expected more from this film, take a 10 minute page from insidious, when contacting the dead, maybe have more dead.",

It's the same tired tropes and clich\u00e9's and scares we are all used to, and yes, they still work, but the possibilities for the Ouija board game are many, and perhaps the film-makers channelled the wrong spirit on this one.",

I was actually looking at my watch the last 15 minutes and pleading with time to accelerate, in order to be done with this. I had to pause when the inevitable good vs evil moment occurs in the basement, just so I could log into IMDb and write this (I hardly ever write reviews, but felt Compelled to this time).So I went back and finished viewing it - Olivia Cooke is OK...um passable (just barely) in most of the stuff she's in. She's alright in Bates Motel, but here (and in her recent roles) dunno why but whichever character she plays is the one I can't take seriously anymore. She sails through each role with the same distant, doe-eyed 'I'm thinking something important' look, and it's really gotten old already.The rest of the cast is the stock standard teen angst type. Good looking and dumb thinking. Nothing original here. I just really regretted watching this. When Shelley Hennig's character (Debbie) appears in the last act of the film to assist her friend, I literally laughed out loud - her expression and the way she appeared was so comedic.Well the target audience is probably not old enough to have seen a dozen or more similar haunting spirit films over the last few years and that's probably why we'll continue to get these kinds of features for years to come. *sigh*.Please people, don't waste your time, yeah it's horror so it's not meant to be an acting masterpiece, but even horror should have some level of atmosphere. This had a supernatural force trying to make 'scary' faces any chance it gets and the film goes all out for silly jump scares.Why does the human race not use the medium of Film and TV for more important stuff. How many resources and how much effort went into making this horrendous creation? Why, oh why do we see 'entertainment' like this produced again and again. Please Ouija and similar producers, find other, more meaningful ways to earn. Exasperated. 1 Star for the laughs at the end.",

            "content": "If I could give this a negative, I would.The story features a group of teenagers and their bad decisions. It starts off with Laine and Debbie as children playing with a Ouija board. Years later as teenagers, Debbie is home alone and is shown destroying a Ouija board. Laine wants Debbie to go to a game with her but Debbie is acting weird and tells Laine about the Ouija board and Laine dismisses it, she goes on her way and Debbie stays home alone. The spooky ookies start and Debbie hangs herself after seeing something through the planchette.This makes Laine go into full blown melodramatic teenager mode, who convinces her friends Isabelle, Pete, and boyfriend Trevor to go with her to Debbie's house to try and contact Debbie, with her sister Sarah tagging along because she feels she can't leave her same age sister alone. They make contact with whom they believe is Debbie, talk a bit, until the planchette moves to 'Goodbye' and all the lights in the house turn off. While the others are investigating, Pete gets his forehead smashed into a mirror and the group leaves, Laine taking the board with her, and later their housekeeper/grandmother (its never stated what she is) tells Laine to not use the board and get rid of it. After the first session, each of the teenagers is greeted with the message 'Hi friend' the next day. Laine decides it is Debbie trying to contact them because there is something she wants to tell them, so the group decides to go back to Debbie's house to try again. During the session some more things happen such as a chair moving, and the group, through asking questions, finds out who they were contacting was not Debbie, but an entity known as D.Z., a little girl with her mouth stitched shut, and warns the group to \"Run, Mother is Coming\". Enter scary ghost lady and the group flees in terror. Isabelle is the next to die after seemingly being possessed in her bathroom.Laine discovers D.Z. was a little girl named Doris Zander who was reported missing years ago and had lived in the house prior. She also discovers Doris had a sister named Pauline, who killed their mother and was sent to a mental institute. Pauline concludes that Laine had used a talking board to make contact, and tells her their mother had gone insane and sew Doris' mouth shut and killed her to keep spirits from communicating with her. Pauline tells Laine she must find Doris' body in a hidden room in the basement, and cut the threads to release Doris so that Doris can 'fight Mother' and free the group from the mother's curse. The teens find the body and accomplish the task but Pete is killed that night. Laine returns to the mental institute to ask Pauline why it did not work, and learns Doris is the evil spirit, not the mother, and that Pauline had promised Doris to help free her so Doris would leave Pauline alone and the mother had been trying to protect the teens. Laine consults her housekeeper/grandmother who tells her they must destroy the body and the board. So Laine, Sarah, and Trevor return to Debbie's house but Trevor is killed by Doris while the girls go to the basement. Sarah is captured by Doris and about to be killed until Laine starts using the board by herself, making Doris play with her. Debbie's spirit appears and helps Laine fend off Doris so Sarah is able to throw the body into the furnace, and the girls then throw the board in and Doris disappears. Some days later the girls are talking about the incident and after showering, Laine finds the planchette in her room waiting.Overall it was an overly done plot with bad writing, a rushed story, and bad acting. Laine essentially starts the cycle, yet becomes cynical later when Debbie tells her about having played with the board, then wastes no time becoming a full fledged believer. She breaks her own rules for the board, and has hostility towards her sister, who is supposed to be a 'wild child' that does nothing more than go out the front door to go out with her boyfriend whom Laine doesn't approve of. Note its okay for Laine's boyfriend to orchestrate a camping/surf trip and lie about it. And I'm pretty sure Debbie was manipulated into killing herself for deciding to leave a full plate of food out on the kitchen plate before going to bed.. that would aggravate any vengeful mother spirit.The Pauline side story was just unneeded and unrealistic, especially since Pauline says \"You used a talking board and you used it in a graveyard\", which goes completely unnoticed by Laine who doesn't bother to object to that statement or correct her. Other than that, it took about 50 minutes into an 89 minute film for the plot to show up and challenge the protagonists, and then it raced along to a very anti-climatic finish. Seriously, who doesn't report the body of a child that's been listed as missing for years to the police? Breaking into a morgue or having to dig up the remains would've presented some actual conflict to the ending, but the absence of any logic or common sense is quite aggravating in this film in particular. I'll end this on a positive note as being one of the rare times Michael Bay has been attached to a project and there wasn't an explosion every five seconds. Even the furnace scene was quite tame.",

I have seen several movies where a Quija board played a major role in the story line but to say it is clich\u00e9 or boring was simply not the case. This movie was geared for a young audience and not really adults past early twenties. I see some mention The Shining which is a movie I didn't like. It was over acted and silly but still entertaining to most. It definitely isn't a gold standard to hole anything up to.I don't know what people expected given the fact the story was about a group of teenagers who were using a Quija board. That portion was typical because most think of the boards as toys or evil. It is neither. Any movie made concerning these boards will have to attach possession or something dark and evil or there is no story. This is what people do, sit at a table and use it. It is actually supposed to be two people and the board is supposed to be between laps. I have seen the planchette move so quickly you have to have someone else write the letters down. NEVER has there been anything evil that followed. That is tied to religious beliefs but the movie wouldn't be able to go anywhere unless it went that direction. So I agree that part would be predictable but this story didn't follow others except in the fact there was a board.The acting was fine and the movie was well cast. I have seen horror movies that were so bad this one would win an academy award. Nowadays you can read synopsis or watch a trailer. There is no reason for anyone to go to a movie and not have a remote idea of what it was about. The bottom line here is there weren't enough blood and guts in it to satisfy some. I enjoyed it and it was a good jump at the shadows type of movie with a decent plot and that was, \"Why did Debbie kill herself?\"",

            "content": "Not gonna lie, the horror genre is not my favorite genre. In fact, when it comes to the big screen, horror movies, in general, have some of the more dumber plots I've seen. Ouija is just one example of how dumb horror movies are capable of getting.I've never played the game, nor do I care to, but basically this movie is about what happens when someone uses a Ouija board to talk to the dead. Okay, fine. The concept of basing a horror film out of a game is fine enough that I can give this film a shot. But the way this film was executed left a lot to be desired.The plot was pretty annoying. It was unoriginal and/or headache-inducing in many senses of the word. By the time all the characters I would ever know about got involved with the game, I knew everyone who was living and who was dying. Not only that, but the extra characters really just were there to bring on the headaches and annoy me with their presence. For example, one of the characters (Doris's sister who I couldn't care less what her name was) even told me one thing about the plot in the movie and it all ended up being a lie thrown from nowhere and at that point, I couldn't wait for the movie to be over.The plot itself worn out its welcome not too far into the film. That's right! It was, at the beginning, tolerable. But especially in the second half of the movie, monkey wrench after monkey wrench was unnecessarily thrown when nothing is still known about any of the characters. Did the curse get broken or what? Why was the movie even still going at that point? What was still missing? The cliffhanger ending makes sure this question is never answered and even worse, what could have been 1 hour at the most is drawn out to 89 minutes. All in all, all I got from the movie was a gigantic headache.However, I will say that I liked Debbie as a character. She brings a little life into the movie. Also, as annoyingly devoid of intelligence as this movie is, it does provide a few jump scares and explains maybe a few things. All that saves it from getting a lower score, but it brings more questions than answers, it was grating to the mind, and I didn't really care for anybody at all.And now to set the movie from fire if I could.",

Then I made the mistake of watching the prequel / sequel first and re-watching the original second. Big mistake. The Origin writers had no idea what the first movie's history was. They did an awful job trying to give us more backstory on the Origin of Evil. But what they did do was have a wonderful child actress, Lulu Wilson, who was eerie and creepy and unsettling, something the original Ouija did not have. None of the cast stood out or acted well. It must have been the directing, because I have seen some of the cast in other things and liked them. This movie pales in comparison to Origin, but Origin sucks because it did not take the history told in this story and use it correctly. My recommendation, if you like one of these movies, don't watch the other. And if you want to watch both, watch them years apart so you don't remember the inaccuracies. I changed my rating to a 4.",

            "content": "Every horror movie breaks down into a few crucial categories: plot, characters, believability, and audio/visual design.1. Plot (2/10) -- As for the plot, it's iffy at best. I was less confused and more annoyed at the ~twists and turns~ that played out.2. Characters (dialogue, personality, etc) (5/10) -- There was nothing that particularly stood out about any of the characters; the dialogue tended to be awkward at best, their motives and morals seem to turn on dimes, and, as with most horror movies, they're dangerously oblivious to most of the threats.3. Believability (suspension of disbelief, realism where applicable) (??/10) -- While I often found myself criticizing the movie's realism, it IS a supernatural horror movie, and I've never been one to easily suspend my disbelief. That being said, while some may be more immersed, there are issues with some physical, testable, *cough* obvious *cough* things that were ignored for dramatic effect.4. Audio/Visual Design (10/10) -- The only thing that I found to be worth the $20 I spent on tickets was the audio and visual. Every camera shot, every movement, every angle was PERFECT and was a pleasant surprise compared to most of the rest of the film. Whoever did the camera-work is a genius.The audio was even better; one noise in particular toward the beginning left me with warm fuzzy feelings because it was so perfect realistic and obviously something the sound design worked hard on. Most of the fear from the movie came from the very subtle bass behind some movements. Placing a flashlight down, taking a step forward, even just opening a door, accented with an almost inaudible bass that you feel in your blood and guts that puts you in a pleasant unease, but not overdone to the point that you ever quite get used to it.Overall, watching it is an experience, and there are fantastic examples of what and what not to do in a horror movie. It was a learning experience more than entertainment, and while I'm likely to watch it again to get more specifics, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone looking for a good, solid scary movie.",

And it actually tells about the events that preceded the first film of 2014.\nBut it really doesn't matter what order you see the movies. In any case they are both good films (the movie from 2016 is a little better than the first one).In conclusion, I loved and warmly recommend to anyone who has not seen the second film yet, to see it this one first and then to move on to the 2nd.",

A poor script, obvious heel turns and no scares, this jumbled mess of a film.

            "content": "People often defend horror movies. They say they're \"fun\", and I understand, people like to be scared. It's thrilling at times, and I agree that horror movies can be good, but that doesn't mean they all are, especially nowadays. Horror movies used to serve a purpose, they used to have a brain and a heart, and more on their mind than simply trying to scare everyone that goes to see it.So I'm not writing this on the film's ability to scare, if you want me to, then fine, I'll sum it up. The movie is as scary as any other horror movie released in the past 5 years. Also remember, the film is rated PG-13, which restricts it from showing too much, although I must admit it, they seem to have gotten away with a lot with \"Ouija\". It seems quite clear that most modern horror films have only one thing in mind: to scare the crap out of everyone as much and as often as possible. This has been the case for a while now, so much that I think people begin to forget about the story, which in this case, is absolutely horrible. It's even titled incorrectly, the Ouija board is barely a part of it, and it could've been better. It's basically only a reason for all of this crazy ghost nonsense to be happening, it's not smart or clever or unique in any way at all.On top of the lame story, \"Ouija\" has little to no characterization, and of course they get good looking young actors and actresses to star in it, because that's so realistic right? Honestly, I often got confused about the differentiation between characters. They're all so similar, and why does the audience care if any of them succeed at their ultimate goal: to stop the ghosts and such, you know, the stuff that used to matter in older horror films. It's possible to make a good horror movie, it is. It's just so difficult for people to do it when all that seems to be on their mind is the film's ability to be scary. Yes, they're horror films, obviously they should scare you, but we're all so sick of the anticipated jump scares. Can a movie scare us without finding the need to cheaply jump out for a quick second, especially when we can anticipate it? Horror movies are boring nowadays, and \"Ouija\" doesn't change anything. I watched a film called \"Psycho\". Nothing jumped out, no loud music played for a split second, yet it's chilling as hell. When I left the theater after \"Ouija\" I quickly returned to reality. A good horror movie should scare you with its story, it should have the ability to effect the way you think about the world. It should make you wonder. It should not make you laugh.",

Olivia Cooke (also in Bates Motel) was clearly the best actor out of the bunch, but had no personality. At all. To all makers of horror: you cannot be scared for someone if they seem boring, predictable and one- dimensional (\"I never got to say goodbye\"). In reality, all the events occurring in the film would be horrifying in real life, but because of the superficial way the characters react in their circumstances, it didn't even phase me. Go to the archives? Why not just google how to stop Ouija hauntings? Where the heck is there archives in my city? Is it really that accessible? Without getting too much into it, I was entertained, but the movie had more horror potential. Glad I rented it instead of watching it in the theater. Also, I like that lady from Insidious. Is she in every film of this genre nowadays?",

            "content": "There's a certain quaintness to Ouija, the supernatural horror film based on the game that allowed slumber-partiers to mess around with the occult. Were it not for the omnipresence of smartphones and a scene where a character watches an expositionally helpful YouTube video, the film could easily be a relic from back when Parker Brothers first flooded the toy market with Ouija boards in the '60s. None of the clean-cut teen stars in the cast smoke, drink, do drugs, have sex, or get even remotely nude (when one character is dispatched as she's drawing a bath, she's still wearing her socks). There's no real gore and nothing beyond what looks like a relatively minor effects budget, so without the usual trappings of a pick-em- off scare flick, Ouija has to rely on atmosphere and narrative. It excels at neither. To director Stiles White's credit, the movie takes its time building a world, beginning with an opening sequence in which the hero, Laine (Bates Motel's Olivia Cooke), checks in on her troubled best pal, Debbie (Shelly Hennig, of MTV's Teen Wolf). Debbie and Laine played with the Ouija when they were kids, and Debbie may have accidentally unleashed something sinister with it. Once the ground rules are established, and it turns out that the spirit of a girl murdered in Debbie's house decades ago is using our well-scrubbed crew as conduits for a resurrection (and knocking people off when she sees fit), the atmosphere created by White and cinematographer David Emmerichs falls away, and focus shifts to the thudding script. The early part of Ouija has some creepy bits that thankfully don't rely on simple sound gags. And it has the decency to not be a found-footage movie. But once the plot machinations kick in, it becomes kind of goofy, even for a film about malevolent ghosts who possess people through a board game. Ouija is one of those movies where everything is easily solved, even though those solutions are completely absurd, and the climax relies on both the advice of a character we barely know and a totally dopey deus ex machina. Within the pungent field of other wide-release scare jobs and films derived from cardboard-based time-killers for kids, Ouija stacks up relatively well, thanks to its look and a confident performance by Cooke. That said, it's still best left on the shelf. C-",

            "content": "So first off, I'm pretty sure everyone who gave this film a review of 7+/10 is just trying to promote the movie. There's no way the movie could have been that large of a flop upon it's theater release and then everyone rented it and decided it was amazing. Don't fall for their tricks. Save your money for an actual scary movie.I've given this movie 3/10, which is really sad because I typically love b-movies- you know, those stupid ones where the blood looks pink instead of red? I guess I'm mostly upset at Ouija because it had all the makes for a great film and had amazing production, but the entire story was lacking. It's as if the producers from Insidous said \"Oh, we can just throw this out there to make money off of until our prequel comes out next year. They'll watch it because it's us.\" Thus, they did. And thus, I did. And I almost fell asleep. Twice. I NEVER fall asleep during movies. This is another teen 'scary' movie. But it's the kind where rich kids get into a bunch of trouble because their parents don't care about them. We know their parents don't care because they're ALL out of town the ENTIRE film. Except once. Laines best friend for all eternity, Debbie, gets snuffed out by a ghost at the beginning of the movie and when her parents come back for the funeral, they all but push Laine into watching their house while they leave town again. No tears, no remorse. It's like, Oh, our kid just died, will you watch our house instead? Thanks! And they're gone again. Second off, all the 'teenagers' (yes, they look too old to be in high school) somehow think that playing with a Ouija board is just 'playing a game'. Yes, we all know Hasbro sells the dumb things in toy stores. But we all also know that it's not 'just a game'. Half of them are purchased now just for the novelty of what they are. It's not like Laine and Debbie couldn't have just played Monopoly. It's also not like the board Debbie conveniently found in her attic was actually made by Hasbro. That thing was WAY too old to be 'just a game'. Another kicker is how Laine walks around asking people questions about Debbie the entire first half of the movie. I'm sorry, but aren't there people who do that for a living? Like I don't know, maybe DETECTIVES? Plus, she keeps asking Debbie's boyfriend for help, who, by the way, doesn't look near cute enough to be someone a girl like Debbie would date in real life. It's like they made him seem creepy to make him a suspect to viewers, even though we already knew straight out of the box that something paranormal was going on. And while we're talking about boyfriends, Laines boyfriend is no winner either. They make him seem sweet but he just becomes annoying by saying Laine needs to basically get over Debbie's death. I'm pretty sure if nothing paranormal happened in their lives, Laine and Debbie's boyfriends could have just got together and pulled off a remake of Scream- that's how weird their choices in guys are.To top all of this off, NOTHING that happened in the previews happened in the movie, and I'm pretty sure half of the pictures on this page weren't in the movie either. Only about three scary things happened, but they were mostly jumpy and expected. The 'terrifying spirit' was way overused. By the end of this movie I felt like I did at the end of The Ring Two, when they used Samara's (the little girl's) reanimated corpse so much that she started looking more comical than scary. Also, this movie has about eight different endings. They just decided to throw them all in the same movie so there's never a real climax- just an empty longing for the movie to finally end so you can take it back and rent something actually worth your while. I'd recommend Killer Barbies Vs. Dracula or Kracker Jack'd- those are a couple of b-movies worth staying awake for.",

I was trying to be unbiased but its asking for a more in- depth analysis. This film was bland and boring from the outset. It is a tried and tested formula to pump mass horror onto the movie screen. There was nothing original about the film. Heck, even Jumangi held more interest for a film based on a board game. The supernatural in this was rubbish. Special effects added nothing to the movie and I would even suspect it had a really low budget.Acting was bland, you couldn't get into any of the characters. None of them had story, with most simply being put into the film to make up deaths from what I can tell. No one even died in original ways. There was simply, supernatural, death, and a rubbish ending.Do not pay to watch this film, you will feel robbed, wait for it on TV.",

I would agree with the other user who advised not to take this too seriously and enjoy it for what it is, but I would argue that it takes itself too seriously for that.",

Had to follow up with \"Oija.\"The film is a pretty straight forward B-grade horror movie. Typical jump scares and plot points, with the mystery of the movie built well in the first half. During the second half of the film the writing does drop off a bit and becomes expository, telling too much rather than continuing the buildup of the first act. Because of that, the second half of the film feels rushed towards its ending which again follows the usual rhythm of horror movies.Overall a watchable film that will ultimately be forgettable, and good enough for a watch.",

First off the story is very good, it is well thought out and builds up rather nicely. The problem is that while the build up of the story is good, the film tends to end almost straight away. It is slow to start but this is actually a good thing as you are introduced to the characters, and fully aware of what is going on. However, once the viewers are aware of the storyline the film tends to speed up and rush towards what can only be described as a very abrupt ending.I adore a good (hide behind a cushion) jump scare, and this film on a couple of occasions didn't disappoint. The story as mentioned is very well thought out and could have been fantastic, but it is ruined as it has been rushed. Overall it isn't a bad movie, there isn't any disgusting filth in it (like most horror films nowadays) and it is worth a watch. I rated it a 4/10 perhaps I was harsh, it could possibly be increased to a 5 or a 6. Would I watch it again? Perhaps, if it was on tele one night and I was stuck for something else to watch. I certainly wouldn't buy it.",

It takes about an hour for anything scary to happen in Ouija and, after that, it's not really that frightening. This horror film exclusively relies on jump scares to elicit any sort of reaction from its audience. Some of them work, but you can see most of them coming from a mile away.

The beginning was a little slow, as all horror movies tend to be, but once this movie started to pick up, it got pretty exciting. The ghosts in this movie were very creepy, and the intensity of the scenes really kicked up a whole couple gears when the climax hit. There were some things about \"Ouija\" that this movie just didn't bother to really explain, such as Lin Shaye's character (Paulina Zander), as there was just a hole in the plot where her character and that family comes in. However, the story of the little girl and the entire ghost world was actually pretty smart, and actually got to me quite a bit while watching. Some of the acting in this movie wasn't the best, sure, and a lot of the characters just seemed to somehow stay perfectly calm as all the mayhem was going on around them, but in the end, those were just minor flaws. There were plenty of scary and exciting scenes in \"Ouija\", and even if it took a little while to get to them, and there were a few minor problems with the plot, I still think that \"Ouija\" is definitely worth watching.",

            "content": "In October of 2014, Ouija was unleashed unto the world. From a critical standpoint, it had been reviewed as one of the worst horror films in years. It ranked among many audience members top ten worst films of that year and very quickly dropped at the box office. Still, it made much more than what it cost to make, so obviously it would warrant its sequel coming soon, but lets have a look back on what spawned Ouija: Origin of Evil. While this film is admittedly bad, there are a few aspects that keep me from saying it is complete trash. Most people comment on how bad this film is as a whole, but it does attempt to tell an emotional story. Here is why the story of this film is under-appreciated, even if its execution is pretty bad. \n\nWhile the idea of a Ouija board has never been all that terrifying or interesting enough to me, I must say that the first ten to twenty minutes of this film had me intrigued. It was less of a horror film and more of a drama about how this board makes people commit suicide. It was a very depressing first act, but it surely played all of the right moves to keep me engaged. That being said, the film quickly spirals into a cliche-ridden story with all of the horror tropes you have come to expect. To add to that, there aren't even enough of the cliched tropes to even call this a full-fledged horror flick. It is more of a drama with horror elements, which would have worked better if the films main focus was not on a game that is meant to scare people. \n\nAlthough almost every character throughout this film is completely one-note, including the main protagonist, Laine, played by Olivia Cooke. Cooke does give a solid performance here, which comes as no surprise, due to the fact that I think she is a terrific actress in almost everything she is in. That being said, her character is not given enough to do, other than weep over the loss of her friend and learn more about the Ouija board. This film is a series of unanswered questions about who is really behind the words being spelled out on the board. By the end of the film you already known everything and the conclusion is about as cliche as you can get. \n\nThis film is about as serious as you can get with a horror film, but it does come off as comical at times. There are shocking moments that are ruined, due to the fact that they are just too silly to take seriously once revealed. I found myself poking fun at the film rather than being genuinely terrified. Not to say that there are not a few chilling moments, but most of them are followed up by something you see coming from a mile away. This film does nothing new to try and scare its audience. Normally great camerawork in a horror film can help build tension for a viewer, but this film was shot pretty static, making everything seem clean. \n\nIn the end, I admired the fact that Ouija tried to put a dramatic spin on this horror film, rather than just going all out on its horror aspects, but it was too little and it almost felt completely absent after the first act. When a film begins with promise, only to abandon its viewers halfway through, it becomes a frustrating film to watch. I see where everyone is coming from when they speak of how truly awful this film is. That being said, Ouija does have enough solid performances and intriguing set-up to say that it is not quite as bad as the critics make it out to be, but that is not saying much when looking back on the overall film. Simply put, this is a pretty bad horror film with some neat ideas.",

While it's not terrible, I've seen much worse than this, it's still not a great film and relies too much on exausted horror cliches, like loud jumpscares and spooky noises, which just feels down right uncreative. You can tell the film was directed to the teen market, like myself, but even I didn't appeal to the film, especially during the second half, while the first half, I do have to say, is entertaining. And the film's ending is one of the worst I've ever seen in my life, it's the \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" of endings, it's cheap and stupid and leaves no explanation to what the fuck just happened.",

The plot doesn't make a lot of sense and the overall outcome doesn't really make sense either. The movie is about a a group of friends who come together after their friend Debbie (Shelley Hennig) dies under strange circumstances. Debbie told her close friend Laine (Olivia Cooke) that she found a Ouija board in her attic and used it by herself (which is a no no). So, Debbie dies and Laine expects something with the Ouija board is the reason why. Debbie, her boyfriend Trevor (Daren Kagasoff), their friend Isabelle (Bianca Santos), Laine's sister Sarah (Ana Coto) and Debbies boyfriend Pete (Douglas Smith) come together to use the Ouija board and uncover the truth. They soon realize they're over their head. You notice that list of characters? You notice it's just way too much characters to actually care about. The body list is high in this one because as a viewer you just don't care about any of them really. The twist to everything is super predictable as well.

The person watching does not know why the girl just threw the ouija board in the fire but it makes them want to keep watching because it gives a feeling of mystery. Following the Buring of the ouija board we learn the young girl's name is Debbie, the movie then takes a stereo typical but still scary turn. The evil spirit takes over Debbie's body and kills her. Debbie's friends refuse to believe she would do this to herself, so they vow to find the truth. Then Lane, Debbie's closest friend, finds a video of her using the board alone. Debbie knew not to use a Ouija Board alone but did it anyway. This is where the film goes off the rails. The standard horror-movie elements come out, involving ghosts, zombie-like trances and violent, exorcist like actions. Little is left to the imagination, which is what makes this so scary.\n\tAs you get deeper into the movie you will find more suspense. For example a Ouija Board is pretty simple, but the filmmakers had to add a little detail not included in the original Ouija Board. In the film, if you look through the \u0093window\u0094 of the planchette, you actually can see dead people. This adds another layer of terror when it is not only things jumping out to scare you, but actual scary images of dead character. Most horror movies just put one or the other but the filmmakers of Ouija did an outstanding job with combining both. So If you enjoy horror films I would highly recommend this movie for teens or young adults.",

With a ridiculous premise, horrible actors, bad pacing, cheesy effects, laughable dialogue and a boring and predictable script, Ouija is very hard to get through. I can't remember the last time I watched a horror film and felt absolutely nothing. There are sequences where you can see the filmmakers are trying so hard to create atmosphere and tension, and they just miss the mark so epically every time. It's not scary because the plot makes no sense, and the film doesn't explain ANYTHING. People just start dying, and we are never told why and no effort is made to build the ghost/spirit(?) up as any legitimate threat with a malicious nature. The ghost appears to play by its own random laws, and that isn't scary. Not once did I feel the slightest hint of unease or fear, and it was actually kind of sad seeing so many genuine failed attempts. \nThe lead girl in this movie, Olivia Cooke, is actually a really good actress, but even her talent was completely squandered by the terrible writing and direction, and that was pretty sad to watch too. In fact this whole movie made me pretty sad, especially knowing that this is the kind of horror movie that mass audiences are watching. The resolution of the film too (how they defeat the ghost) is so laughably easy, reminiscent of an episode of Supernatural the way the spirit is defeated so simply in a procedural type fashion. And the use of the Ouija board is totally forced. Also, the movie even comes with one MASSIVE defining plot hole that renders the entire plot nonsensical - just to make it that little bit worse.\nOuija is the definition of generic, studio-packaged horror that is completely misguided, unscary and uninspiring. I want to laugh at this movie, but the fact that Ouija represents mainstream horror, made a ton of money and will likely get an equally bad sequel is more sad than anything.",

Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a C grade.\nOuijabord:\nA ouijabord is a game that was put into the market by the American company Parker Brothers.

            "content": "Let me just start off by saying I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. There was quite a bit of hype around it, but being an avid horror fan I had my doubts they could make another haunting movie scary. Mostly due to my opinion on the quality of a certain haunting movie franchise that I personally think is overrated. I can't say this movie brought anything new to horror, and I don't think it surpasses much more than being \"Good\", but I can say that it does have a refreshing take on the genre. \n\nThe story was pretty good and I'm honestly surprised at how well they pay respects to actual medium rules and guidelines. It's impressive to see an actual spiritual contact concept be given proper representation unlike some other movies (*coughconjuringcough*). And I'll be honest, the only reason I knew there would be a twist in the story was that I saw there was still plenty of time left in the movie for the twist to appear. If they had drawn out the scenes of supposedly being done, it would have been a legitimate surprise that there was a twist. \n\nThere are at least seven characters involved and while none of them are oscar worthy performances, it's passable. The characters themselves aren't horribly bland, but they don't have a whole lot of personality either. Personality in your main protagonists isn't exactly a strong suit in horror movies, though, so the effort they manage to put in is appreciated. \n\nI will give the movie this to its credit: The characters are smart. I think Ouija may be the horror movie that has the least number of times I called the protagonists \"Dumbass.\" They turn on lights, they make a point to never do something alone, they actually think about what they're doing before they do it, they know to f**king run whenever bad shit happens, and they constantly jump to the simple solution of fixing their problems. Now granted, there are times in the film where I shook my head and told the characters they're idiots, but it was far less than in other horror films. \n\nFinal Verdict\nOuija is far from a masterpiece and I honestly don't expect it to get a cult following, but it's probably one of the better horror movies I've seen come out since Saw and Paranormal Activity finally stopped cluttering up the horror movie genre. It's good, but it's not great. I'm glad I didn't see it in theaters because I don't think it was worth the price of a ticket. However, if you're a fan of horror movies like I am, I think it's worthy of being part of the collection...but just barely.",

The acting is horrible but the only person that did a decent job was Lin Shaye and she was in the movie for 5 minutes. The story is so boring and it's not even scary. The movie felt so long that I just wanted it to end. Also the twist in the film was so stupid and predictable. The jump scares in the film aren't even scary. What Insidious did right is that when a jump scare happen it had a scary image. In this it didn't have scary images. This movie makes Annabelle look like a masterpiece. Hollywood needs to stop making films like this. DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE I BEG OF YOU DON'T DO IT!!!",

            "content": "Review:\nI usually stay away from movies in this genre because I'm not a big fan of the supernatural but I thought that I would give this a go because there's not that many new films coming out this month. What A Big Mistake! Everybody knows that nothing good comes out with playing with a Ouija board but when Laine's best friend mysteriously dies, she finds footage of her using the board so she decides to try and connect to her through the board, with her friends. Clever! They then awaken a dark force which begins to make there life hell so they seek help to try and takedown the dark force. To be honest, I totally lost interest in this film once I saw that it was a gullible bunch of teenagers messing with a darker force. The acting isn't that great and the predictable storyline became tedious after a while. The little bit of action towards the end was also a let down, after such a big build up and I really don't know why they just didn't leave the whole board thing alone after the first mysterious death. Anyway, I totally didn't enjoy this film and I can't believe that it made so much money at the box office. Boring & Uninteresting!\u00c2\u00a0\n\nRound-Up:\nAll of the cast in this movie, haven't starred in anything major before this project so I can't really comment on there performance. Its the first movie from director, Stiles White, but he has contributed to many big movies with his writing and special effect skills. From Jurassic Park III, Galaxy Quest, The Sixth Sense, Interview With A Vampire and the Ghost in the Darkness, we have all enjoyed his special effects at some point and he has also written the Possession and Knowing, which weren't that great. With such a big profit at the box office, I'm sure were going to be seeing Ouija II soon but I personally won't be rushing to see it. My expectations for the movie wasn't that high so I wasn't that surprised with the outcome. It also didn't go down well with the critics which is why I'm so surprised with the box office takings. There's obviously still an audience for this type of movie but I still find it quite hard to take them seriously.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nBudget: $5million\nWorldwide Gross: $102.5million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their supernatural, horror movies about a group of friends who try and connect to there dead friend through a Ouija board. 2/10",

Olivia Cooke was solid, despite having very little to work with.\n\nThe Bad: As with most modern horror films, it was more \"jumpy\" than scary. On top of that, it relies on the same cliches that litter every other horror film  for the last decade and brings nothing new to the genre whatsoever. Now, I don't expect award-winning performances or complex characterization in a horror flick, but I do expect an attempt at mediocrity (or better, if I can get it) ... there was none of that in this film. A great story and script can overcome some very poor performances, but that was also missing. A half-hearted attempt all around.",

The person who directed this film wrote it as well, and he managed to do both very poorly. The film is also poor acted, and the characters are poorly developed (They are all your typical stupid white teens) so that you don't care if any of them make it out alive (speaking of which, there are very few deaths here and the ones that do occur are extremely weak and unsatisfying). Olivia Cooke has proven that she can act in the surprisingly great show Bates Motel, but she fumbles and flops here....it's almost like she isn't even trying (something that can safely be said about most people that were involved with this film).  Lin Shae makes a brief appearance, but is reduced to being a babbling crazy woman (how embarrassing. She seems to be the only one even remotely trying here, but she is given zip to work with). The Ouija Board has a rich history and mythology behind it. Really, it shouldn't have been too hard to craft a cool horror flick based around the board (Hell, a Ouija documentary about the history of the board and the mythology and stories that surround it would have been cool). Unfortunately (and bafflingly), the people behind this film were clearly very lazy and instead decided to make a generic, paint-by-numbers horror film that has absolutely zero scares and zero surprises. The film is aimed squarely at the young teen female demographic, and I can easily see young teen girls playing it at a slumber party and pretending to be scared while watching it. I suppose that if you've never seen a horror film before, then MAYBE this could freak you out a bit but for anyone who is a fan of the horror genre or the Ouija Board this is a supremely disappointing and BORING film. SKIP IT SKIP IT SKIP IT! (Also didn't like the extra rules they added for the Board).",

The story was bad and just seemed to be all over the place like the writers didn't know what to do with it.

            "content": "This is a stupid movie even going back to its planning phases.  This film is produced by Hasbro Films (who have developed such classics as the Transformers franchise, the GI Joe franchise, Battleship, and this film).  Now that I read that, this company must have the worst track record in developing quality films of anyone out there.  But I digress.  The idea behind this movie, I'm assuming, is making a movie that somehow manages to sell people on Ouija boards, so they're motivated to go out and get one.  They go about this by making, theoretically, a movie so goddamn scary that people won't want to buy their stupid board game anyway.  And I say theoretically, because this movie isn't scary at all.  At the same time in all of that lack of scares, it doesn't make playing on this Ouija board look like much fun.  Then again how in the fuck do you make summoning the spirits look like fun.  I suppose you could have them asking stupid questions like 'will Chad ask me out to the prom' or 'will my girlfriend and I have sex tonight'.  Stupid shit like that.  At the very least with The Lego Movie, in all its awesomeness, made you want to go out and buy all the legos you could.  Hell even some of Hasbro Films' productions, as terrible as they may have been, made people, mostly kids, want to buy the merchandise.  I guess the people who went out and bought Ouija boards after this were people who don't give a shit about superstition and would want to summon all the spirits they could.  But those people are already likely to have Ouija boards anyway, so it makes this film's existence perplexing and unnecessary at the same time.  As can be explicitly seen, from the score I gave this, this movie is absolutely fucking horrendous.  It's just a disaster from beginning to end, stealing shamelessly from various, and superior, horror movies.  Not to mention the main character being immensely unlikable.  Unlikable in the sense that her stupid bullshit about wanting to say goodbye to her friend, who killed herself, THROUGH A FUCKING OUIJA BOARD is possibly the most idea I've ever heard in my life.  And her insistence on seeing this through to the end ends up in two of her friends, and her boyfriend, all ending up fucking dead.  I understand the need to say goodbye to a friend after a tragic suicide, or what looks to be a suicide in this case.  But, really, your best option at saying goodbye is using a board game?  For fuck's sake.  Look when one of my friends dies due to doing something at my insistence, you know what, I would fucking stop.  Nope, that's not what the main character does.  She insists on her and her friends finishing what she started in the first place.  How fucking selfish.  It's not that the character's personality is unlikable, it's that her actions are unlikable and result in the death of three people, and her sister almost pays the prize for her stupidity as well.  Instead of just going to her friend's grave, saying goodbye and leaving it at that, she had to go get three more people killed.  Hell, she's more unlikable than the \"villain\" in the film.  The only way this film would work, in any way, is if you pretend that all of the characters are idiots with 2 brain cells.  That's the only way this will be enjoyed.  The film relies on old and tired jump scares, a few of which will probably be effective for some people.  But, you all know how I feel about horror movies and their reliance on them.  It's fucking lazy, it's cheap and it's easy.  Unexpected loud noises will almost always get a reaction, that doesn't mean it's actually scary.  You've all heard this before.  The acting is horrible with the exception of Lin Shaye, who should be in every North American horror movie.  I blame the acting being awful in shitty characterization and not on the cast.  Though I wouldn't say that they're great to begin with, but I'm sure they're slightly better than what was shown on here.  The story, do I even have to go into it?  It was awful, what the fuck do you expect?  This movie is all around fucking awful.  I'd have to go back through my reviews, but this would definitely have to be the worst movie from 2014.  No question.  The few decent scares are not nearly enough to save this from an incompetent plot and even more incompetent characters.  This is just a dreadful experience.  One that I will hopefully put out of my mind 5 minutes after finishing this review.  Just don't.  There's so much good horror out there, like House Bound and Dead Snow 2.",

This film has way too much exposition and it's added as the film goes along under the guise of clues or uncovering a mystery where there isn't much of one. We have two very brief Ouija sessions and that is it. The rest is mundane activities looking dramatic, more exposition, and some menacing shadows and writing. \n\nThings perked up a bit when Insidious Lady showed up but things quickly got boring again. And typical.\n\nI didn't expect anything from this film and still managed to be disappointed. There's one achievement Ouija definitely has.",

However, the overall story is interesting and features a pretty decent, although not totally surprising twist--This  is what you would expect from a modern horror film these days, but is able to present watchable content while not dwelling to far out of the ordinary. You'll probably already know the story about the ancient spirit board that can have supernatural abilities linked to the dead, but Ouija manages to make them interesting and fun to watch. Not only that, but it seems as though the producers and directors knew exactly how to coordinate the plot in order to make the film robust. Unlike other horror films these days that go so far out to stand out, Ouija a uses a simple premise that just works. The acting is good, the story is good, and the scares might sometimes lift a hair up from the back of your neck!!",

            "content": "\"Ouija\" is somewhat of a paradox of a film. Imagine a movie made by the makers of a game warning you not to play the game. Now imagine the makers of a game warning you not to play it, but double-dog daring you to play it. I've pretty much just described Hasbro's supernatural horror dud \"Ouija.\"\n\nA girl is mysteriously killed after recording herself playing with an ancient Ouija board. A group of her friends investigate the spirit board. They soon find out some things aren't meant to be played with when they awaken the dark powers of the \"other side.\"\n\n\"Ouija\" is one of those movies where the kids involved do incredibly stupid stuff, make all the wrong decisions, and then die because of their bad choices. Unlike most teen slasher films, there's nothing fun or humorous here to be found. It's just one predictably bad action after the next resulting in death for whoever committed the transgression against the dead.\n\nSet up like a visual instruction manual, \"Ouija\" teaches you how to play the board game you know you shouldn't. It's like they're taunting you to play with fire. Imagine someone telling you not to do something, but then giving you exact guidelines on how to do it. The actors say the words they're supposed to and follow the rules to communicate with the dead... which is never a good idea, by the way. It all plays out like an over-extended TV commercial to sell the game.\n\nThe ultimate message of \"Ouija\" is you shouldn't play with the occult. Unfortunately, the message gets a little jumbled up when the friends use it to do battle against the spirits. Okay... so don't use it unless you need to use it to fight the bad guys? Am I getting this right? \n\n\"Ouija is rated PG-13, of course. Why wouldn't it be since its target demographic is plainly teens looking for mild scares. It includes disturbing violent content, frightening horror images, and thematic material.\n\nThe only special features included for \"Ouija\" is a bland \"Making of\" featurette. It's around three minutes long and consists of the cast and crew yammering about being scared on the set. They also talk about playing with the board for a movie that tells you not to play with the board while being a commercial for it. I digress... much like the movie.\n\nAny Christian is going to have problems with watching \"Ouija.\" We're all warned from childhood not to play with the occult or communicate with the dead... and with good reason. It's pretty cut and dry in the Bible. When my wife found out I watched the movie in our home, she made me immediately take it out of the house and put it in the car. The film really does send a mixed message to younger viewers. \n\n\"Ouija\" is obviously an attempt at both promoting a Hasbro board game and creating a teen version of \"Insidious\" or \"The Conjuring.\" However, there's nothing to be found here that is even half as endearing or memorable as either of those two films. Even the little twist during the climax can't save the movie in the end. \n\nIf you want to buy \"Ouija,\" you know where to find it. I'm not going to have providing a link to purchase it on my conscious.\n\nwww.ersink.com",

The acting is fine, Olivia Cooke is the best part in the movie, but their characters are not so. I barely know anything about them and it doesn't make me root for them to survive as they keep doing stupid things. The scares are limited in it, and once in a while it startled me at the very best, but for most of them I knew where it was going and was just going for loud noises to scare people. I do appreciate that despite being a ghost story, it doesn't become an exorcist movie when Ouija goes along, but it gives us scenes that reminds us of other scary movies that are way better than this.

We have a new winner for garbage Halloween films, Ouija. \n\nBang! Bang! Bang! Racket ... we need more racket to scare the audience! This is director Stiles White's (Knowing and The Possession, ugh) logic behind scaring the audience effectively. And you know what? It didn't work one single bit. In fact, if anything, it made the actor's look even stupider than they already were. From the moment Ouija began you knew that you were going to be sitting through a major snore fest. Half of the film is just blundering product placement for that ridiculous Ouija board. Please come buy this. You know you'll like it. It's the game to die for ... \n\nIf only that was the truth for this film: After the recent death of Laine's (Olivia Cooke) dear friend Debbie (Shelley Hennig), she decides to invite all of her buddies (Ana Coto, Daren Kagasoff, Bianca A. Santos and Douglas Smith) over to hold an s\u00e9ance in honor of Debbie. So Debbie apparently committed suicide because of this Ouija board and Laine thinks it would be a great idea to still communicate with it? ... Bravo Laine. On top of the unintelligent cast is the lack of scares and the kiddy PG-13 rating. Universal Pictures only did this to bump up their box office moola. It's also a cheap scheme to get all of the middle schooler's to see their so-called 'scary' Halloween movie ... lame. \n\nThe part that's really frustrating about this movie is the lack of scares. White thinks making loud noises will make the audience jump, but instead it makes the movies less serious and more laughable. An effective scary movie uses suspense, tension and dramatic/eerie music too draw the viewers in. There's also lots of striking camera movements/angles to keep us on the edge of our seats until the scares come naturally not forcefully. Ouija does none of this and ends up recycling far superior horror films. This board, as well as the movie, is best left on the shelf.",

While most of the SCARE here comes from the annoyingly loud jumpy sounds but the ghost feature does look frightening in a few scenes, but that's all the film has to offer. As this film is rated PG-13, there are some violences but nothing GORY or anything. Overall, this is a lazy, loud, dumb, and dull horror film that will probably amuses to those who have never seen any horror films in their lives before. [D+]",

Scary as well which I got bruises on my arm to prove from how many times my girl kept grabbing my arm. As well as being scary it was nice to finally get some descent acting such as from Olivia Cooke who has made it big on the show Bates Motel. Also a nice cameo from Lin Shaye whose character luckily doesn't rip off Insidious which had me worried especially placing her in a horror in between Insidious sequels.

Stiles White directs the film with little passion and does little to build any genuine atmosphere or suspense throughout the entire film and just relies on cheap jump scares, diluting the film of any genuine fear.

After getting saved by Tadashi from a group of robot fighter thugs, Hiro is taken to his brother\u00e2??s college which Hiro calls \u00e2??Nerd School.\" Tadashi shows Hiro the experiment that he's been working on; a loveable robot healthcare nurse named Baymax (voiced by Scott Adsit). Hiro is amazed by what Tadashi has created and motivated to join him. At the exhibition to apply to the college, Hiro unveils his microbots invention. Impressed by Hiro\u00e2??s invention, Professor Callaghan (voiced by Academy Award nominee & Emmy Award winner James Cromwell) offers Hiro a place at school only to be one-up\u00e2??ed by businessman, Allistair Krei (voiced by Alan Tudyk of Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, TV\u00e2??s Firefly & Serenity) who wants to buy Hiro\u00e2??s microbots which results in tragedy.

Miller), Hiro will save the city of San Fransokyo, but also learn the power of friendship though tough times. Based on the popular Marvel comics, directors Don Hall and Chris Williams together with screenwriters Jordan Roberts, Daniel Gerson & Robert L.

Her childhood best friend Laine Morris (Olivia Cooke), her boyfriend Pete (Douglas Smith), Laine's boyfriend Trevor (Daren Kagasoff), their friend Isabelle (Bianca Santos), and Laine's sister Sarah (Ana Coto), all dealing with Debbie's loss, decide to investigate the Ouija board. They later find out that some things aren't meant to be played with, especially the other side.\n\nOuija is the bastard three-way love child of Hasbro, Transformers director Michael Bay's production company Platinum Dunes, and Blumhouse, the production company of Jason Blum, the producer of films such as Paranormal Activity, Sinister, Insidious, Oculus, and The Purge. The project was first conceived as a supernatural adventure action film with a proposed budget of $100 million.\n\nScott Stewart, Breck Eisner, McG, Sylvain White, Pierre Morrel, and John Moore were all in talks to direct, and the original script by Richard Jefferies was going through several re-writes. Screenwriters included Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz (Tron: Legacy), Marti Noxon (Fright Night), and Simon Kinberg (Jumper) among others. However, Universal shut down the project because of budgetary concerns. Later, they decided to resurrect the project and re-tool the script as a microbudget horror film, hiring Jason Blum as producer and Juliet Snowden & Stiles White to pen the screenplay, with White making his directorial debut with the film.\n\nYes, I actually saw Ouija. But keep in mind I did not pay my money for this. I, instead, paid for John Wick (a movie that actually looks good), and snuck into this piece of shit. To make a long story short, Ouija is one of the worst films I've seen all year as well as the worst and dumbest horror film I've seen this year. Bad acting, bad writing, bad story, bad characters, bad directing, the list goes on. Ouija is the worst film ever to be released under the Hasbro name. Yes, worse than Revenge of the Fallen, Age of Extinction, and Battleship.\n\nNow, is there anything good about Ouija? Yes. There are only three good things I can say about this movie. The first good thing is Olivia Cooke's decent performance as Laine, the main protagonist. You can tell Cooke's trying very hard to turn her boring, poorly written character into something. The second good thing is the slick cinematography by David Emmerichs. Ouija is an admittedly well-shot, sleek-looking picture. The third good thing is that the opening ten minutes were watchable and atmospheric.\n\nThat's where all the good stuff ends, because everything else is absolutely horrendous. With the exception of Olivia Cooke, the actors are all terrible. The dialogue they exchange between each other is either laughable or horribly clich\u00e9d and generic. These are some of the most bland, boring, one-dimensional characters in film history. Seriously, there isn't any character development at all. The actors put no effort into their performances. They're never convincing or believable.\n\nStiles White's direction starts off well enough but then quickly sinks into the bottom of the barrel. His script, co-written with Juliet Snowden, is just horrendous. Dialogue? Terrible. Story? Terrible. Plotting? Terrible. Everything about this script was just terrible. Here's the big twist: So there's this little girl that these dumb-ass teenage cardboard cutouts mistaken for characters come into contact with using the Ouija board.\n\nThe little girl warns them all of her evil mother, who's killing all their friends, so she tells Laine to find her dead body and remove the stitches from her mouth so she can stop the madness and defeat her mother. Laine does exactly this, only to find out that the little girl was evil all along and that the mother was warning them that her daughter is evil and was lying to them. If the mother was innocent and the little girl who needed her body to be freed because it was trapped was the bad one, how the fuck were people dying before? This makes no sense!\n\nAnd of course, here's the big one: IT'S NOT FUCKING SCARY. This movie isn't even OCCASIONALLY startling. Most of the scares consist of loud, irritating, cheap jump scares and horror visuals you have seen from every other fucking horror movie ever made. I was begging this movie to end. It was just so boring, so ineptly scripted, so horribly paced, so badly acted and directed, I considered walking out of the theater. Fuck this movie and never watch it. If someone buys the DVD for you in a few months, punch them for insulting you.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 1/10\n\nThe first ten minutes were effective, Olivia Cooke was solid as the lead, and the cinematography was pretty good, but the story was nonsensical, the characters are dull as shit, the other actors either needed to express emotion or need acting lessons, the dialogue is terrible, there's no tension, there's no atmosphere, nothing is ever scary, and the twist was maddeningly incomprehensible. Ouija is a pathetic excuse for a movie. You're better off playing with an actual Ouija board than sitting down and watching this crap.",

The acting in this movie was so bland and so dreadful, I see nursery kids act better then the people in this movie. The character's in this movie are so stupid and really uninteresting, and in every bad horror film there just to get killed off or fill out the screen time with their awful acting.

            "content": "Playing with the dark forces with such formulaic redundancy that they pretty much become dark farces, horrid horror movie Ouija follows Battleship into the abyss of poor board game movie adaptations. Pretty young things get dead, like, bad. And, if we hadn't seen these trappings so many times before in better thrillers, the unique supernatural plaything twist might've provoked some new thrills. Instead, it plays out as predictably as a Little Golden Book. Once the game offs one of the childhood group who innocently played Ouija as kids, the now-teenage players reunite for - wait for it - one more game. They act like its a way to help them grieve but  the goings-on meet such predictable ends that you wonder how these pretty libel liars walked into this scenario having watched so many similar set-ups on-screen. Granted, they set up their own closed mouth ghost story but its derivative stuff. Honestly, the two minutes of screen time dedicated to a Ouija board in The Exorcist generates more legitimate jumps and screams than the entire 90 minute running time of this flick.\n\nIn this PG-13-rated horror flick, a group of friends (Cooke, Coto, et al) confront their most terrifying fears when an innocent game awakens the dark powers of an ancient spirit board. Well, here we groan again. \n\nEmerging as a standout from the decent scarer The Quiet Ones, Olivia Cooke's performance remains serviceable even if the dialogue comes off as pure stock. The rest of the cast can't act their way out of a paper bag, which the mostly recycled script seems to have been written on. As for first time feature director Stiles White. Most of the actual thrills come from people walking in on the POV unexpectedly. This doesn't count as horror; it simply counts as bad timing.\n\nBottom line: Bored Games",

If they go into the theatre already convinced that the angry spirits of the netherworld are waiting to pounce upon the living via wooden SMS messaging, then that's fine. If hardline skeptics emerge blinking into the foyer afterwards, shrugging off an hour and a half of solid scares, that's also fine. But if you make no attempt to convince the doubters, even through characters in your film, then it's going to be an eye-rolling ride. There are no cynical characters in 'Ouija', just a bunch of teenagers who appear to be auditioning for 'Final Destination 6'.\n\n'Ouija' is a film which realises it's been staggeringly lacklustre in its build up, so for its third-act revelation not only employs an attic and a basement, but also some old black-and-white photographs, a creepy child's doll AND wheels out (literally) 'Insidious's Lin Shaye to explain the last sixty minutes and set up the next twenty five. The film is at least reasonably effective in what it does; the problem is that 'What It Does' is lazily rehash every mid-budget horror made in the last 30 years...",

This movie suffer with really clich\u00c3\u00a9 horror elements like the jump scares, acting, suspense, ect. Let me just say I knew this wasn't gonna be a good movie not even a decent one I knew this movie was gonna suck as soon as walked into that theatre. I had hope with this movie because the idea of the Ouija board is pretty clever for a movie maker because of it's background and legacy throughout the years. But of course this movie just messes the opportunity up big time. The acting is bad, no surprise they're. The jump scares are cheap and predictable. The movie looks like a straight to Netflix film, yeah that's how bad the CGI looks in this movie, the plot was very very very dumb, no character development at all, a lot and I mean a lot of plot holes, and the list goes on and on. The plot twist in this movie was not really clever but caught me by surprise. And I was going to give it one star for that but then I started to think about it more and more. Then figured out that this was a BS twist that made no sense to increase the very short run time of the movie. The characters are so idiotic I was glad some of them died. I give the film this. Some death scenes were pretty cool and graphic for a PG-13 movie and that's on the mediocre scale for me but I have to put one positive thing about this horrible movie just to be nice. But why can I be nice to such a cash grab movie like Ouija. If you seen the movie then you know exactly what I mean. The ending of the movie is so stupid and was a forced set up for a sequel. This ending was worst than 'The Maze Runner' ending! Please never see this movie in your life! Seriously, don't save your self from a bag of stinky smelly garbage like this movie. I'm going to give 'Ouija' a F grading. Even though some death scenes were mediocre at best. That still couldn't nudge the movie out of the F range! I'm just glad I'm done with the movie and NO I won't see the sequel!",

In this remake, a girl dies unexpectedly and her friend uses the Ouija Board to contact her.  I know it sounds interesting, but believe me It Is NOT !!!  This remake is not a horror but a horrible film.  Not only does this movie SUCK but it completely associates itself with the original version of this film which was made in 1986 called \"Witchboard aka Ouija\".  The original flick from 1986 \"Witchboard\" was one of my favorite all time movies and it was sad to see that the horrible  2014 remake lived no where near the expectation of the original movie from 1986.  This remake SUCKED and I absolutely do not recommend seeing it in the theaters, DVD or even on regular cable.  Take my word, if you are interested in this movie, Please do yourself a favor and rent the original 1986 flick called \"Witchboard\".  The original was Great and the 2014 remake SUCKS... in fact the only thing i can say about the remake is that it was a little scarier then Annabelle, another one of the so so lame horror flick that was released in 2014.",

            "content": "Ouija is a flawed but great Horror film and it is a very neat Horror film to watch for Halloween along with Annabelle. Ouija is about a group of friends who lost their friend after their friend committed suicide and one of them decided to try to use the Ouija board to contact her but soon they learn that they did not contact their friend and instead the group learns that they unleash an evil force that is ready to kill them and the group must find a way to end the haunting before they all get killed. I just came home from Robinsons with my parents in watching this film and I have to say it was a great experience and this film and Annabelle are worth watching for this Halloween. At one point when I saw the trailers I was kinda expecting a Horror movie that at least uses the genuine Horror elements from the 60's-80's the result is the movie delivers instead another Insidious or The Conjuring type style Horror film and it does work at one point and I love that these are the type of Horror movies that are showing now a days instead of films like Saw or Hostel back from 2003-2010 movies like Saw were successful at the box office and this year movies like this are now successful beginning with Insidious and The Conjuring. What's very good about this film is that the movie has a unique, creepy and grim atmosphere from start to finish and it gives the film a creepy feel and sends a lot of chills down on my spine. The other good things about this film is that the movie has a couple of good scares and creepy moments(The opening scene, Scenes with the group using the Ouija board, The attic sequence and the creepy sequence when Lin Shaye starts to react at the main protagonist)plus the soundtrack is creepy and the editing by Ken Blackwell(Friday The 13th remake)is outstanding oh and the pacing is good, deliberate and neat. Now like I said the movie itself is flawed and the film suffers from a few issues. One of the film's main problems is the film's shallow screenplay which is also full of plot holes and missing plot points. The film also isn't suspenceful. There's hardly any tension in several scenes. There are a few dull moments. Most of the CGI is poor. There are a few scares that at times worked but some tried to work but ends up failing. A few also of the scares are a bit predictable and the ending is flat, disappointing and overwhelming. Now the acting is pretty good the casts did a decent job with their performances in the film mostly the acting range from good to decent and I think out of all the casts Lin Shaye was the best out of all the casts and I love her performance in this film as much as I enjoy watching her in the Insidious film and I love that in the Insidious films her character is a loving, kind and helpful person and then when she appeared in this film her performance range from kind hearted to super creepy and chilling. Director Stiles White did a great job with his work on this film and for a first time director he at least delivered a great Halloween Horror film and hopefully he'll make another good Horror film either next year or in the near future. Overall Ouija is a flawed but entertaining Horror film with a couple of good scares and worth watching for this Halloween along with Annabelle. This movie could have been better if it was directed by James Wan and written instead by Leigh Whannel and Mike Flanagan. I would dare say that if you want a perfect Halloween movie I highly recommend The Conjuring, Insidious 1 and 2 along with Oculus oh and Oculus is still the best Horror film of 2014. This movie gets an 8/10.",

The cast is full of people who are only there to die and once they actually do bite it, none of the other characters seem to give a fuck; they have blank reactions and then just move on! The script is one of the all-time stupids that had me groaning at all the terrible set-ups and contrived reasons for the characters to continue using the board. This film went through tons of re-shoots and it shows because the twist makes no damn sense and the ending is laughably non-existant.

            "content": "Wow.  Just wow.  I'm struggling to come up with sentences that lack the word \"garbage\" to describe this movie.  Never have I seen a more blatant halloween cash grab than 2014's \"Ouija\".  Riding on the heels of the decent PG-13 horror films of the past few years such as Insidious and Paranormal Activity, Ouija, with its ominous title and minimalistic marketing, (For the record, I don't watch trailers anymore), seemed like it would at least be a fun movie.  \n\nI was wrong.\n\nEvery overplayed generic cliche of the genre is present here.  There's no mood, there's no atmosphere, there's nothing here.  You can feel the movie attempt to build tension, but the pacing is so off-putting and terrible that the plot line crumbles out from underneath it.  \n\nThe saddest thing is that most of the cast actually felt like they were trying to be decent in their terribly written parts, and failing miserably. These kids don't have a bright future ahead of them, unless they find a director who doesn't take \"Pouty looks\" as an excuse for acting.\n\n  The main character, Laine, makes such backwards decisions for her friends who blindly follow her that I found myself guffawing at the screen.  The male characters, who seemed like they accidentally walked onto a set from an \"Abercrombie and Fitch\" ad, had little to no say in what happened in the film, and Laine's puppy-dog eyes seemed to be able to get them to do the stupidest things at the drop of a hat.  Every kid in the group was hollow, and I breathed a sigh of relief watching each and every one get killed off, knowing I was growing ever closer to the credits rolling.\n\n\nWhich brings me to the kills themselves, you know, what most of us go to these movies to see.  The \"HORROR\" part of the horror movie.  Well, even with all the supernatural power of ghosts and demons, they could come up with creative ways to kill off these kids.  Each and every kill has the same stitched-mouth, white eyes effect, and it loses its touch after the very first time.  Made me wish I could just have my eyes sewn shut.\n  The main characters main love interest gets possessed and then just goes poof.  Into a cloud of particles. Seriously.  I know it's PG-13, but it shouldn't feel like the Fairly Odd Parents just poofed a character out of the film.  It was like they granted my wish!  He was gone for the rest of the film.  What's funny is, the leading lady cares even less about these characters than the audience!  It's the poor writing that does it, but damn.  Not a tear shed for all her dead friends that she's responsible for the deaths of at all!  What a sociopath.\n\n If you're coming to this film looking for any interesting characters, story, or even a scare or two, turn back while you can.  \n\nIf you're absolutely wanting some positivity out of this review, here it is.\n\nLin Shaye is the only redeeming actor in the film.  She plays a psycho in a mental ward.  I don't know what it is about Lin Shaye, but she always captures my attention more than other characters in today's horror films.  There's just a tone she uses that's really unique, although I feel she plays the same Shamanistic-paranormal-knowledge character in every role.  Yet, there's something charming about it, as cheesy as it is. If she keeps on keeping on specifically in the horror genre, she could very easily land in a Vincent Price-esque role for modern horror movies. I hope so, because it seems like she really has fun in her horror roles.\n\nTL;DR: The 13 year old girls that sat behind my date and I were Laughing at the scares.  Does that not say enough?",

The filmmakers didn't know where to take the story. It also had one of the worst twists I've ever seen, a twist that made what came before it make no sense. Still, it was inoffensive and it was well filmed. I wouldn't recommend it though.",

Great scare factors... YEEEEEEES. The story starts off with a younglady that is best friends with the main character, she over a course of days has been basically M.I.A so the main character pays her a visit to check in her. She tells her she is experiencing strange things, and no spoilers but the bestfriend leaves, and the fun begins. With all fairness to the film, although I liked it, in some areas it lacked like most horror films. The story should have gone a little more indepth and the scares should have been longer but overall it was not a sucky film. I cant say its a MUST SEE, so I will say its a great film for this Halloween 2014 to check out. P.S. the ending bummed me out with a cliffhanger, BUT left room for part 2! ;)",

The resources and materials for the film isn't something potentially fresh but the film makers are being lazy, substituting a supernatural board game and then imitated with Paranormal Activity lame scares and the thrilling secret behind just as in Insidious. It is obviously that the ending which intends for another sequel closed in a pointless and ridiculous way, fooling and wasting the time of audiences, which one may feel to just purchase an Ouija from Hasbro, perform self-playing and force pointing the planchette to the direction of no for this overall disappointing horror film.",

From the way that it ended, there will be a sequel. I thought that the way the Ouija board kept on appearing was the funniest thing ever in the entire film because the audience could NOT get over talking about it and really reacting to it resurfacing like Michael Myers in all the Halloween movies! Lol! In short, this movie was enjoyable & it is always good to see people get scared in a horror film that is not scary or has minimal horror in it! The cast of young actors did an average job, but the main character, Lainie really did a good job at looking scared, skeptical, and the lead. I have to give credit where it is due.

This is on a level worse than a teen scream. \nThere are no real scary parts even when they try, there is no creativity to the plot and there is no reason for this. \nI do admit that there is potential with the idea of a Ouija board movie but this is not the road to have taken. The same thing happened with Battleship a couple of years ago. It just does not work at all. Clue is one of the only few exceptions, maybe the only exception actually. This movie is a waste of time and money even if you torrent it. Be warned.",

The movie has a simple cliche horror movie plot, four friends want to find out what really killed their seemingly happy, hot popular girl best friend and get caught up in the other world along the way. The film provided some emotional dialouge between Oliva Cooke(who is amazing in the film) and I'm just going to call her Elaine(insidious) but the final climax of the movie was just terrible. It didn't make any sense and it just painful to watch. So many things were out of place, Elaine didn't make any sense, Why didn't Olivia Cooke do anything to help her friends and so many other unanswered questions. The film made 20 million opening weekend on a 5 million budget so expect a sequel next year. Especially the stupid ending where she knows something is there when she looks in the planchette, that was just painful to watch. Overall, it's a fun stupid movie to watch with your friends and not think about the flaws much. Coming soon Ouija 2:Age of Planchette",

There seems to be this trend lately in horror movies that we rely solely on jump scares to make things work.\n\nNow, with that being said, this film does have a few effective jump scares, but because they aren't preceded by this overwhelming feeling of dread, they aren't scary. Yeah, you may jump, but even you begin to feel stupid for jumping at it. Director Stiles White makes this happen, because all he does to make you jump is keep things quiet, and then all of a sudden makes a creature jump out and scream with deafening noise. That's not a good scare, that's just effective.\n\nWhat happened to playing with our anticipation? What happened with playing with convention?

As a quick refresher, Ouija boards are supposed to be gateways that demons and spirits can use to communicate and essentially gain entry into the human world. In the case of this movie, it's a malevolent spirit. I found the execution of this movie to be scattered and confusing. The evil spirits are never really fully defined, thus I am left with an unclear picture of what drove the spirit to kill so many people. The jump scares in the movie, however clich\u00e9d, kept my attention for most of the movie, and the acting is serviceable, but what this movie is really lacking is clarity. For example, I'm still not sure which spirit tortured the friends with the \"Hi, Friend\" message. I enjoyed watching this film in the spirit of Halloween, but it is an incredibly derivative and unremarkable horror film. I won't fail it, but there is really nothing terrific to take from this film other than semi-effective jump scares that will at least (mostly) keep your interest ----------------------------------------------- C",

Debby plays with an Ouija board from up in the attic and a spirit possesses her to kill herself causing her friends to play the game together to see if they can seek out her spirit. Throughout the movie we go by the typical jump scares and horror movie cliches, nothing special. Some special effects looked great though, the makeup on the spirits was pretty cool and the spirits being thrown into the wall and making a shadow was cool. I can honestly say I don't remember anyone's name except for Elaine, Trevor and Debby. VERY forgettable characters and forgettable performances too, although whoever played Elaine was pretty good. There were no shockers as to what happened except seeing the lady from Insidious who was forgettable actually. The creators had such a great opportunity with a plot like this but completely went the wrong way. When Debby came back from the dead to save Elaine, I was so stupefied as to why they did that. SHE'S DEAD let that be a mystery as to why they couldn't find her. Lot of scenes like that too, example: when the power goes out and they try turning on one lamp and Trevor says \"All the power is out\". There's a lot they could've done to make this movie more interesting but I give it a star for entertainment because it was interesting at parts and Elaine was a pretty good character. Ouija is a skippable horror flick that is sleepover material and not a great horror movie really. I hate to see a good idea for a movie go to waste like this. D-",

Not that I expected much from a horror film based on the spooky toy, once mass-marketed by Parker Brothers, but it amounts to nothing all that special or entertaining, just laughably dull.  Something interesting to note is how so many old slasher films and even the recent Saw franchise, among other horror franchises, end up receiving similar bad review scores, but will go on to be remembered by cult audiences.  No one will remember Ouija.  That is the kind of movie it is. This is a thing that will come and go.  It may have allowed work for some young actors and a decent job for the filmmakers involved, but that's about it.  Good on them for getting the film done, but yeah, it's just a silly horror movie.\n\nread the whole review at thecodeiszeek.com",

It did start in a good note the movie, but it slowly went downhill with some of the dumbest decisions made by the characters, cliches everywhere, and no actual scares or any real violence. I mean, I already knew beforehand that it wouldn't be a good horror movie because of its classification, but for the most part it was pretty tame in what really makes a real horror movie scary and nerve-wracking. But overall, this could actually be the start of a new franchise, that if done differently and with more thought put into the actual story and content, could be quite effective and creepy as this one should've been. \n~October 23, 2014~",

            "content": "Earlier this year, I saw a new horror film called It Follows. I'ts nice to get a solid horror movie amidst a pile of feces. Guillermo del Toro's, Crimson Peak hits theaters later this year as well. Nowadays, most horror movies are sh*t. Just when I think, maybe they'll get better, they get much worse. Films based on board games have been made before. Needless to say, most of them have been horrible. I can remember the classic Robin Williams film, Jumanji. Well, now we have a new one. \"Ouija\" is directed by Stiles White, and it's based on the board game of the same name. Frankly, it doesn't matter who stars in the film.\n\nThe story is-in is much detail as I can give-a girl plays the Ouija board and dies. Her parents find her hanging in their home. The first ten minutes are bearable. It wasn't great, but it set up everything plain enough. A girl hangs herself and all of her friends have to figure it out. Well, this doesn't last long. They go to the house, feel a presence, and assume it's their friend. Obviously, they have to use the board, and obviously they have to play in the house of their dead friend. Obviously, there are endless jump scares, none of which are scary. Obviously, the acting is really bad.\n\nI certainly wasn't expecting grade A performances, but these kids were awful. If there was one decent performance, it came from Olivia Cooke. Surprisingly, she was actually really good. Everyone else was a complete brick, especially Douglas Smith. None of the characters are memorable, none of them are interesting.\n\nI want to touch on the \"horror\" aspects of the film. The director has no idea how to make a horror film. While certain scary images are somewhat decent, and certain character deaths are sort of effective, they kill it with the incessant jump scares. A good horror film doesn't use this many jump scares. Personally, I have found the best horror films build tension slowly throughout themselves. When you use jump scares constantly, it makes the experience less scary, and more annoying. I was able to predict almost every single jump scare, before it happened. Some of them weren't even scary. Some idiot would yell or come around a corner making a loud noise. Sometimes a kid would drop something, or shut a door to hard. It was so predictable, not to mention boring as hell.\n\n\"Ouija\" is a film based on a board game. If that's not enough to get you uninterested, stay tuned for the final verdict. If there was one redeeming feature in this movie, it was the beautiful cinematography. Aside from this, everything was crass. The acting was garbage, the dialogue and script were juvenile, and it wasn't scary. Sure, some of the scares-maybe two of them-worked fine. It was just a drag from start to finish. At least it wasn't as horrible as A Haunted House 2.",

And in this particular case the prop is just hiding the fact that Ouija is actually more of a haunted house, critters in the attic film more than about an object of the occult. In this case it circles around a group of friends whose lead two female buddies played with Ouijas as children as their initial way to bond, as as adults comes as a wedge between them. When while playing with the Ouija one night the blonde friend has an encounter which results in her suicide, the rest of the scooby gang get together to initially mourn and then hold a saiance in order to make sense of the ghastly occurances that led to the event since it seemed so out of character. Enter the 1950's ghosts of the family who originally played with the board and shadows playing tricks with you and there you essentially have the film. Nothing cinematic or truely scary. Just an extremely slim premise that remotely has to do with something scary that hopes to pull in the droves at Halloween.

It's thrilling at times, and I agree that horror movies can be good, but that doesn't mean they all are, especially nowadays. Horror movies used to serve a purpose, they used to have a brain and a heart, and more on their mind than simply trying to scare everyone that goes to see it.\n\nSo I'm not writing this on the film's ability to scare, if you want me to, then fine, I'll sum it up. The movie is as scary as any other horror movie released in the past 5 years. Also remember, the film is rated PG-13, which restricts it from showing too much, although I must admit it, they seem to have gotten away with a lot with \"Ouija\". \n\nIt seems quite clear that most modern horror films have only one thing in mind: to scare the crap out of everyone as much and as often as possible. This has been the case for a while now, so much that I think people begin to forget about the story, which in this case, is absolutely horrible. It's even mistitled, the ouija board is barely a part of it, and it could've been better. It's basically only a reason for all of this crazy ghost nonsense to be happening, it's not smart or clever or unique in any way at all.\n\nOn top of the lame story, \"Ouija\" has little to no characterization, and of course they get good looking young actors and actresses to star in it, because that's so realistic right? Honestly, I often got confused about the differentiation between characters. They're all so similar, and why does the audience care if any of them succeed at their ultimate goal: to stop the ghosts and such, you know, the stuff that used to matter in older horror films.\n\nIt's possible to make a good horror movie, it is. It's just so difficult for people to do it when all that seems to be on their mind is the film's ability to be scary. Yes, they're horror films, obviously they should scare you, but we're all so sick of the anticipated jump scares. Can a movie scare us without finding the need to cheaply jump out for a quick second, especially when we can anticipate it? Horror movies are boring nowadays, and \"Ouija\" doesn't change anything. \n\nI watched a film called \"Psycho\". Nothing jumped out, no loud music played for a split second, yet it's chilling as hell. When I left the theater after \"Ouija\" I quickly returned to reality. A good horror movie should scare you with its story, it should have the ability to effect the way you think about the world. It should make you wonder. It should not make you laugh.",

            "content": "Sometimes I usually just rate it with the stars and don't write a comment, but I had to write one on this one. First of all, let me start by saying thank god I rented it on redbox. I originally was going to get it on Dvd for $20, since this was the movie I hyped most for in 2014 (besides Transformers 4). My friend suggested to get it on redbox first to see if I liked it, and if I did then get it on dvd. If you really want to see this, no matter what, rent it first.\nSecond of all, I am a die hard horror fan. There are only 2 horror movies I don't like (now 3 including this one) and only about 10 movies I have ever seen that I didn't like. So, this shows you if I don't like it, and I hate only 10/ a billion movies I've seen, it must be bad.  I thought it did a well job on creating a creepy atmosphere and having a good story and not just about the ouija board, but i am telling you they tried so hard. They had about 1 million \"jump scares\", and only one of them made me jump. I was so disappointed by the middle of the movie that I turned up the volume and sat in a different position to see if that helped. Nope. So, if a die hard horror/movie fan says this isn't good or scary, it isn't good/ scary.\nLastly, this had so much potential. As I said before, this was the 2nd most hyped movie for me of 2014, since horror movies rarely come out these days, and when they do, they are just about demons and possessions. So, when I found out this was going to be original  and new, I was excited. The trailer made it look creepy, even watching it was creepy (until about 30 minutes in.) \nThis also had Michael bay in it. He has done the purge( if u didn't like that, he did the second one) he did bad boys, transformers, TMNT, and many more. Even he couldn't save this movie.\nAnd one more thing. There was no character development, and no depth in the story. The characters the whole movie either died soon, or you just saw them playing with the board. There was no depth at all concerning there lives aside from being friends. Also, the story wasn't done well. The ouija board playing parts were well, if you consider that the story. I. Talking about the story they add in later on, where she has to unstitch the mouth, and all that. Well, that story was in the last 10 minutes of the movie. Yikes.\n\nUsually I don't write long reviews like this. I usually write in a sentence or 2, or I don't write anything. But I felt like I needed to express my dissapointment. So, no matter how much you think you want, to see it, believe me, you don't. Ouija 2 is coming, and I am excited believe it or not. I'm excited because I have high hopes they will do better. And, usually horror sequels are scarier than the original. So, to end it off, I hate on,y 10 movies that I've ever seen. If I think a movie is bad, it isn't good!!",

Ouija is a supernatural horror film, Universal studios had so many screenwriters tackle on the project, and even some was to speculate it could have been a big budget adventure. Sadly, Juliet Snowden and Stiles White script was green light that provided a smaller budget. The script gave very uninteresting characters, even seeing the actors on screen made them look a little awkward with their interaction. \n\nLaine (Olivia Cooke), Trevor (Daren Kagasoff), Pete (Douglas Smith), Isabelle (Bianca A. Santos) and Sarah (Ana Coto) band together to use a Ouija board to communicate with their dead friend except they have unleashed something sinister. The movie had a very few thrills but was slow moving watching Laine obsessively needing to make ends with their dead friend. The director Stiles White could have made it suspenseful but only following with senseless characters, the music composer could also have done something to add to it. Guess at a low budget, lets not put much effort while there is other supernatural horror films that worked really well like James Wan did with Insidious. \n\nOuija has a concept that could have been something and add to the horror genre. The lazy script and direction, the movie failed to even create suspense but leaving the film boring and slow.",

Santos, Matthew Steele,\nLin Shaye, Ana Coto, Shelley Hennig, Robyn Lively and Vivis Colombetti.\n\nHollywood, will you ever learn. Board games cannot be turned into feature films. \"Battleship\" was a complete mess and now we have \"Ouija\", a supernatural horror film about a spiritual board that kills the teenagers who haven't seen at least one scary movie in their lives. It is one of the least scary movies I have seen in a long while. You will guess every shot from the closet door to the bathroom mirror to the dental floss. You will find more suspense in a game of Hungry Hippos.\n\n\"Ouija\" focuses on a group of friends who are trying to communicate a friend (who had just committed suicide by hanging) by playing around with the Ouija board. Soon, they awaken an evil spirit from the board and the spirit begins to haunt the group by killing them one-by-one. That isn't surprising. The group of five friends are played by Olivia Cooke (from TV's \"Bates Motel\"), Douglas Smith, Daren Kagasoff, Ana Coto and Bianca A. Santos. I believe these young actors will have bright futures in Direct-to-DVD scrap heaps.\n\nDirector and co-writer Stiles White has slow pacing and he can't generate scares or suspense. His previous movie credit was co-writing the godawful Nicolas Cage sci-fi thriller \"Knowing\". Not surprisingly, \"Ouija\" was produced by Jason Blum (who started low budget horror moviemaking with both the \"Paranormal Activity\" and \"Insidious\" franchises) and Michael Bay (who produced the remakes of \"Friday the 13th\", \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" and \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\"). \n\nI'm still not sure any Hasbro board game can be turned in a good feature film but if it has characters, a story and clever writing, I'll make it an exception. Even though it is totally disposable, \"Ouija\" has remained number one at the box office for two straight weeks.\nYou're better off watching \"The Conjuring\" or \"Insidious\" again. That's my advice.",

Hmmm, the jury remains out on that one, although I certainly won't be wanting to try a ouija board anytime soon. I think the whole concept itself is one that strikes fear into people anyway, so the film just has to enhance that fear with some psychologically daunting scenes. I'm not sure if it's fully done that to be honest, as I've not come out any more mentally scarred than I was before watching it. I think the introduction and build up is good, and the anticipation of what's about to happen is quite tense, but in reality what unfolds lets it down a bit as I became lost in translation in the concluding scenes. Evidently, people started becoming possessed by some spirit that has resided in the house as a result of its former occupants actions, but that wasn't presented very well. I think it would be scary to some teens, but not to a hardcore horror fan like myself. It was a little predictable when something was going to jump out, which spoils the atmospheric stakes really. I still liked the movie, and the storyline is always going to have the foundations of a winner, but it needs to be developed a little better in my opinion. The ghostly setting was there to be exploited a little more I think, as it seemed very short and a little rushed in places. There was nothing too original about it, meaning that although I enjoyed it on the whole, I wouldn't really fancy sitting through it again for the sake of friends, nor would I recommend it for a sinister evening in. I'm still looking forward to the sequel mind and will keep an open mind as to how good it could potentially be.",

Keeping that memory in mind, watching a movie about the same is a pretty good reason to add this film into your watch list! Normally when you see a PG-13 horror movie come out, it's either going to totally suck, or rock. Well you guessed it right, this Michael Bay produced horror film is pretty bad! The story is pretty simple, a bunch good looking/no-named actors (most of them in their late 20's) play teenagers, who think it's a logical idea to play with an Ouija board after one of their friends dies from, well while playing with an Ouija board! Ten minutes into the movie, things start spiraling downwards, as we sit through these worthless characters who are systematically getting picked off, one by one; but not in any cool \"Final Destination\" way, but in the dullest, least terrifying way imaginable. Honestly, I love these type of flicks because of the chills, and jumps they induce. Well, this movie didn't present any any of those, for all the jump scares, there wasn't any buildup, and it's predictability was unparalleled. The acting is pretty average, with the lead Olivia Cooke being the only one who actually had some scope, considering the idiotic script. The films also has a cameo from Lin Shaye (Insidious). Overall, there isn't much more to say about this film without becoming redundant. Ouija is a horrible, terribly written, and atrociously directed excuse of a horror film.",

The actors haven't starred in many movies but a thriller such as this doesn't require world renowned actors. There are enough jump scenes in this movie if you are into that in a horror movie. I thought I would enjoy this thriller and I did. I expected it to be creepier and more psychological than it is. The trailer lead me to believe that the movie would be creepier and gorier. I was disappointed overall with the movie but it is still worth a viewing. Ouija sends creepy vibes to the viewer and there are some neat tricks that the director used in the movie. The characters are lead astray and once they are tricked this leads to their demise. A decent thriller with some drawbacks but no flaws that impair the enjoyment of the movie.",

Even though it is confusing and it has some good scares and accidental scares by the characters friends which is the main problem about this movie also the characters and their idiotic choices between playing with Ouija board. In 2012 White and Snowden wrote The Posession which was a mixed attention from critics despite that fact that they did NOT control the rains to make a horror movie Posession was not scary in Ouija they controlled it elements of scares Ouija tries and tries to be the bigger thrills to bet the scary movies to come out in the past like Insidious.\rWhite directed this horror project he did not make a formula of a perfect movie but he made a good script. Also acclaimed producer of (Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake , The Unborn , Amityville horror remake, Nightmare on Elm Street remake), Micheal Bay did not ruin this horror movie he didn't do anything at all but thanks to him this Ouija movie is getting negative reviews from critics.",

The locations, the deaths, and the jump scares all give it a \"been there, done that\" vibe. It's not scary in the slightest. Every now and then a movie like this will at least be mindlessly entertaining, but that isn't the case here. You've seen all this movie has to offer before and it was way better then. This is definitely for the young and the dumb.\r I'm amazed at this movies ability to make the jump scare tactic even less effective. You know when, where, and how it's going to happen. You won't flinch in the slightest. There's no tension and thee is darn sure no fear. The ghosts look so unoriginal it's painful. This might be the least scary horror movie I have ever seen.\r The plot and acting are just as bad. Tension build up is nowhere to be found and everything plays out exactly how you would expect it to. It's painful watching these \"actors\" try to look sad and depressed at the death of one of their friends. It doesn't even use the Ouija board to good effect. It's just your generic haunted house crap.\r The only value it could have had was if you were a teen on a first date. Young, hormonal teens are the only ones who could have derived any enjoyment from this and that would only be from what came after the movie. However that only applies to when it was still in theatres. So what would be the point of watching it now? Maybe you want to try and scare your friends at a slumber party? All this would do is put everyone to sleep and ensure they never come back to your house for another one. Just avoid this crap. With no scares and entertainment value at all it isn't worth anyone's time.\r I give \"Ouija\" a 2.2/10.",

I have never used it but some of my friends with a taste for these themes have used it or know it well enough to ensure that its not a good idea to use it. Here, in Portugal, its better known as \"Jogo do Copo\" (literally Game of the Glass, because the triangular pointer is often swapped for a glass cup that has to be broken after the game). Basically, my friends told me that any spirit or demon can answer the call and deceive the players, and the board is the source of several possessions or supernatural disturbances. I don't know if that's true, I'm telling what I've been told, but I will not pay to see if it's true or not. As the people use to say here, \"prudent man has died old and suspicious man is still alive\". But let's talk about the movie, that's what matters.The film begins with a good horror premise: an Ouija board that is at the origin of the mysterious death of a young woman. The problem is that the whole plot that develops later is of an awful predictability. In terms of scares, the film also fails roundly. Neither the usual sound and visual tricks were able to make me jump from the seat because I was able to foresee them. The tension, usually compulsory in a horror film, is so absent that it can make us fall asleep. The characters are empty, devoid of personality or some feature that makes us like them, and that makes it indifferent whether they live or die. Some are truly stupid and we just don't care about them. The cast is composed of actors with no talent or experience, who deliver wooden performances, unrealistic and without remarkable merit. Finally, its necessary to talk about CGI, visual and sound effects: although the movie is visually regular, the computer effects are very boring and low, probably because of the low budget.",

I think the people behind this film must be lazy AND stupid. This is what often happens when directors fancy themselves as writers and pay their chums to write a screenplay with them.The actors don't seem to believe their own reactions, which become more and more flat as the film progresses. Laine in particular appears less and less engaged and interested in the increasingly incredulous scenes. Maybe she took up the use of mind-numbing sedatives to blunt her increasingly desperate self questioning of \"Why oh why did I sign up for this joke of a film?!\" Well, the director and writers obviously didn't care about the film, so why should they? \"Is there a presence here?\" they ask the Ouija board, while trying their best exude as little presence as possible themselves, silently hoping that their low impact approach to acting will make them invisible enough, so that people will forget that they were ever associated with this crime against film. The characters have no individual characteristics to the point of being hollow. The dialogue is so shallow and unrealistic that it made me laugh out loud and never allowed me to get immersed into the story. A good film IMO has a solid story delivered by decent actors, and makes me forget that it's a film. Ouija with its repetitive, inconsistent plot twists, parades a sign of \"I AM A (BAD) FILM\" in every scene. It's as if the \"writers\" were following a bad screenplay guidebook, hell-bent on using every rookie technique ever invented. Characters state the obvious, they say things that sound unnatural just to reveal information to viewers in a vague attempt of back story and they are suddenly experts on certain things. Without any explanation, Laine is suddenly sure that \"Mother is angry\". When Laine and Debbies bf find pictures of the people who used to live in Debbie's house, Laine's bf stiffly proclaims: \"Judging by these pictures, they were taken in the late 40's, early 50's\". Lol, who talks like that?! Certainly not a leather jacket wearing teenage college student, who is apparently also illiterate, because he has to call Laine over to read aloud the article he found about these previous tenants (an article which of course was the first one he found immediately on typing the words into the search engine of his laptop). And mental granny offers no logical reason for her advice of cutting the stitches off DZ's mouth in order to drive away the evil spirit. The highlight of stupidity is when Debbie's spirit appears in the final spirit battle, complete with triumphant background violins.The trailer resorts to false advertising to trick punters into wasting their time and money on this children's film, which shouldn't be allowed to be categorized as horror. The good reviews here must be the result of paid affiliates and 12 year olds.",
