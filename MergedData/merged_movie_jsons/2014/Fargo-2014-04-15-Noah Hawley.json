            "review_title": "Mind-blowingly brilliant...for two seasons",
            "content": "(Rating and review updated after Season 4).Stories generally set in Minnesota, often involving a minor incident that leads to something huge, and multiple-homicidal. In Season 1 an insurance salesman accidentally hires a hitman to kill the man who has been bullying him all his life. In Season 2 a covered-up hit-and-run has major repercussions. In Season 3 a family feud over a stamp leads to a case of mistaken identity and several murders. In Season 4 two crime gangs feud over territory.Brilliant...for the first two seasons. I was initially sceptical of this series, thinking it was just a serialised version of the Coen Brothers' superb film of the same name. Turns out it's not, but it does have a lot in common with the movie, and this is a good thing.Creator Noah Hawley manages to capture the atmosphere and central concept of the movie without copying the movie. The plots are different to the movie but have the same pattern: a minor incident/decision that, through misunderstanding and bad luck, escalates into something massive, involving multiple murders. There's the white, cold visual aspect to the movie (being set in Minnesota in winter) which leads to a brooding, desolate feel to the series. Plus, there's the dark Coenesque humour. All this, without the Coens having any creative input into the series: they're executive producers, and nothing more.This was especially true in Season 1. The season was so true to the feel of the movie I was sure the Coen brothers had a major hand in it (they didn't). Add in a superb performance by Billy Bob Thornton as the psychopathic Lorne Malvo and Season 1 was off-the-charts brilliant.Season 2 was less intriguing than Season 1 and had a less-tight plot, but had more action. It builds up to this action though and the pacing is superb, building like an avalanche. The last few episodes are absolutely frenetic and riveting. While largely an independent season, the links to characters in Season 1 make this even more interesting. Only downside: the UFOs. They seemed rather gimmicky, added nothing to the story and didn't help the tightness of the plot.Season 3 marked the down-turn of the series. It has some good passages of play, some interesting characters and a wonderful tie-in with Season 1 but is definitely not in the same league as the first two seasons. The plot is far-fetched, truly testing the series' \"This is a true story\" line. Quite clumsy and disjointed at times, with sub-plots that add nothing except to take up time, a cartoonish villain (and one of the most dentally-unhygienic characters of all time) and plot developments that don't always make sense.It also feels a bit unoriginal: the \"police officer who sees the full picture but is hindered by the incompetence of their boss\" angle was covered in Season 1.Throw in some David Lynch-like sequences (often involving Ray Wise, who starred in Twin Peaks) and the season has a style-over-substance feel to it.Overall, Season 3 is watchable but is a major disappointment after Seasons 1 and 2.Season 4 is even worse. It started well enough, with an interesting and intriguing setup, but the writers clearly didn't know where to take everything. There's far too many characters and sub-plots and the pace is pedestrian, resulting in an unfocused, meandering, seemingly interminable season.The writers' keenness to draw things out and lack of ideas is no more demonstrated in Episode 9, an episode that closes off one sub-plot but takes an entire episode to do it when the actual substance of the episode would have taken at most 10 minutes. Plus they throw in heaps of Coenisms to appear reverential and arty and appeal to fans of the original Fargo when all they are doing is padding out the episode. It's also quite ironic, as Season 4 feels nothing like the original film, the remainder of the series or a Coen Brothers production. It's not even set in Minnesota!Season 4 is also not helped by Chris Rock being cast in the lead role. He's a decent comedic actor but here lacked the gravitas for the role.Season ratings: Season 1 10/10 (can I go full Spinal Tap and give this an 11/10? It deserves such a score), Season 2 10/10, Season 3 7/10, Season 4 5/10.",

The weak link is easily season four but even that one is still pretty good, as long as you don't compare it to the first three seasons. This is an anthology series that was inspired by the 1996 film where each season follows a new murder story in some Midwest town with a different cast every season. It has the same feel, style, dark humor, unpredictability, etc as the film did. It has the feel of the Coen brothers but creator Noah Hawley definitely puts his own stamp on it. They're making Season 5 now so I'm definitely looking forward to watching that one too.",

            "content": "You don't have to have seen the original Coen film to enjoy this series, nor does it spoil anything for you if you have seen it: the new TV-show 'Fargo' is entirely its own beast. So far, the only thing the series and the film do have in common is the title and the (fake) premise that both are - allegedly - based on true events that happened somewhere in Minnesota.The writers (and the actors!) do a great job in creating new characters that are as strange and somewhat over the top as most of the iconic Coen creations we've come to love over the years - and Billy Bob Thornton's 'Lorne Malvo' (from season 01) has the potential to reach cult status. Watching bad situations get worse as bad decisions lead to even worse ones and the lives of ordinary people spiral violently out of control is - I shamefully admit - a lot of fun to watch, and it's told here with such a wicked sense of humor that I've so far enjoyed every minute of it. The cast so far has been outstanding (this is an anthology series, so each new season will have its own cast and a new storyline) and the production values - especially the cinematography - are fantastic. Now whether 'Fargo' will appeal to a larger audience despite its quirky characters and non-mainstream look the way a show like 'Breaking Bad' did remains to be seen, but I would strongly recommend this to anyone who enjoys black comedies in general as well as pretty much anything the Coens ever did. Great, pitch black entertainment - 9 out of 10 from me.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

It has the same vibe as the movie, takes place in or around Minnesota has similar characters but is it's own thing apart from the movie.I just finished watching Season 3 and wow it was a doozy. I love this show, it is rare for me to get into a show where I don't notice the episodes flying by. There is some really strong writing with this show. I won't get into the details but will say you end up really caring about the characters, good or bad you want to see what happens to them. In some cases you are rooting for them to win and in others you are rooting for their demise. A lot of times neither plays out.I don't normally go for religious undertones in shows/movies mostly because it is kind of cliche the ol good vs evil thing. This season does it a bit but does it well. I really enjoy this show and can't recommend it enough!",

The deaths, and there are MANY each season, are often very vivid and bloody and awful to watch. I mention this because when the show says it's 'TV-MA'...they REALLY mean it. Kids and sensitive folks definitely should not watch it and I'd be a bit apprehensive to even allow teens to watch the show...it's THAT bloody. So, while I love the show, it's clearly not for everyone due to the gore level...which is more extreme than even many Tarantino movies! You have been warned.",

You will not find many recent reviews that give the new season a good rating. They destroyed it finally. They tried to make the story way too complex and overthought the whole thing. Sometimes it's even stupid, thinking that making one of the characters fart and throw up is going to inject some humor. Is this humor written by a 5 year old? Even my son finds fart jokes ridiculous. The acting is bad. Chris Rock is like a zombie and the big Italian actor who plays Gaetano over acts every scene with his ridiculous eye rolls. It's impossible to connect to any of the characters, they're just too many of them and no time to do a character introduction and build up. I am 3 episodes into the 4th season and that's it for me. i have waited impatiently for years for the 4th season but I am so disappointed to see the end of a good show.",

He is one of the best stand ups alive - but he is, and always has been, a terrible actor. He's stiff and doesn't react off other actors - he just says his lines.\nThis series has had such great actors... Thornton, Plemons, Martin Freeman, Timothy Olyphant, Nick Offerman, etc... great actors have the ability to draw you into their character and make you care so you have to see what becomes of them. Chris Rock can get on stage and make me laugh - he cannot become a different character I subconsciously emotionally invest in and want to know more about. He's always Chris Rock saying lines somebody wrote for him to say.\nThis isn't the movie Grown Ups, or Good Hair, this is a serious show with heavy drama, Midwest racial history and a delivered at slow pace - you need real actors to suck the audience in so we care so much about the characters we're anxious to see what happens to them next.\nI gave it two episodes, but near the end of the second episode I felt like I was enduring the show, not enjoying it.

It was still full of quality in all its structure and acting, but it was too wide-set in terms of screenplay and story, depicting three clans in parallel and the interactions of mostly two with each other in a period of several months, with filler characters and events linking the whole, with a not so bright and satisfying ending.\nThe too numerous characters, part of that true set of events, weakened a little the spirit and soul for which Fargo the series is renowned for; Compact events happening to a tight group of people.Nevertheless, Fargo is a tremendous anthology series for patient people, prepared to immerse themselves in its true story and not afraid to patiently wait for it to unfold and show its ugly face and shocking twists.Recommended to every lover of top-quality Crime Dramas. You will be rewarded with satisfaction and highly impressed after watching all its seasons.Awaiting with anticipation its possible season 5 in around 2-3 years, if it is green-lit.",

They were met and surpassed! I'd even say it's better than the film. The only problem I had was when Kirsten Dunst stabs Jeffrey Donovan in the foot, there's an obvious cut. It's nothing more than a nitpick.\n10/103\nHigh expectations again. They were met, but not surpassed. It was as good as the first season, but to be fair it's pretty hard to top the second season.

From then on I couldn't forget it, I missed it. I started watching several shows later, but nothing came close to BB. I went on a search for such exciting crime dramas and then I saw few people on reddit talk about Narcos and Fargo (most of them) to experience something similar. At first, I googled them and decided to watch Narcos as Google knowledge graph mentions Fargo as a comedy series. So, yeah Narcos was enthralling, but didn't really feel 10/10 especially with too much Spanish. Then I decided to give a try on Fargo and boy oh boy! It's simply sensational.Season 1: The first episode itself left me exuberant. This Martin Freeman guy, right from the day I saw him as Bilbao Baggins, everything he does impresses me and in Fargo there's nothing less. And the others were excellent too, especially Billy Bob Throtton, that man is really one hell of an actor. He is an assassin, every scene of him is jaw dropping with some chills. All in all, Season 1 of Fargo was really the one I was waiting for these whole 6 months and I didn't want to end this beautiful experience, so I immediately decided to watch Season 2.Season 2: Everyone who watched season 1 will have some idea about how season 2 will go on. It opened off very well and the first episode here too ends dramatically. The next 2 episodes were slow-paced and I thought this might turn out like True Detective Season 2 as it couldn't really recreate the magic of the first season (just my opinion). So, right when I thought it's sinking, it just gets better and better from episode 4. There won't be a moment you could take your eyes off till the last minute of the season finale. I'm glad they renewed it for the next season and I really can't wait for that.The music utilized over the two seasons is absolutely mind blowing, the way it relates to each and every scenario is just spectacular. Along with this awesome music, the outstanding piece of poetry depicts the ongoing lives of the people in Fargo. The direction part is really masterful and you can clearly see that in the second season\". It has few flaws but if you're just looking for some real piece of art then Fargo is a must watch.Update: Ok, it's sad to say that this amazing show went downhill later. Season 3 for me was 7/10 but at least very Fargoish but Season 4 is pathetic and should be ignored.",

I like Chris Rock but feel like he was ill-suited for this part. The story and characters are not very engrossing outside of maybe the Nurse. This season feels like some sort of woke nod instead of an actual story. Anyway after making it thru the first few episodes, I happily gave up. Maybe next season will be better, but I am sure not wasting anymore time on this season. Sad, as it is usually a pretty good show. I feel like True Detective went down the same hole.

I was in a way wondering if I was just wasting my time and watching a series that would fall short of everyone's expectations and just flop, like so many other TV series do nowadays. However, that didn't happen at all.The performances were outstanding in my opinion. Martin Freeman was excellent and to my surprise did the accent fairly well. Billy Bob Thornton was amazing as Lorne Malvo, the enigmatic vibe you get from his performance gave me chills.The cinematography is also one of the good things about this pilot. The shots are smart and intriguing, yet still simple and not too overdone. The music is also outstanding. There are times when it is quirky and funny, there are times where it is tragic and sad yet epic, and then there are also the times when it is intense and mysterious.Fargo is mysterious, intense, funny (at times), tragic and just simply plain awesome! I really hope there are more to come like this.10/10",

            "content": "I LOVE Fargo - the movie and the first 3 seasons of the TV show. But Season 4 is just - well, it's terrible, and I can't believe it. The production of Season 4 is comparable to the rest of the series. It looks great. But I think the problem, for me, has to do with the writing.The show hasn't made me care for, or about, any of the characters, with the exception of Rabbi Milligan and Satchel Cannon, the son of the character Chris Rock plays, Loy Cannon. Speaking of Chris Rock, I absolutely love the guy - his stand-up comedian work, his SNL work. He's a very funny guy. And maybe that's the problem, but in this show, his role as a rough, dangerous mob leader, doesn't work. When he yells, he doesn't come across as dangerous - his high-pitched voice comes across as almost funny. See a trend developing? As for other characters, the supposedly \"quirky\" nurse is more weird and annoying than anything. And while she's a \"bad\" and dangerous person, I just don't care about her. Same for the OCD cop - at first he was humorous, but as the show progresses, it's not funny anymore, it's just annoying. See the other trend here? \"Annoying\" becomes a theme in later episodes. Other than Rabbi and Satchel, the character of \"Deafy\" Wickware - played by Timothy Oliphant - is the only one that is funny and interesting, but, so far in episode 6, he's a small character that is rarely part of the story.As much as I criticize the show, I'm still watching. Why? Because of the incredibly high-quality of everything \"Fargo\" has always been. I keep expecting that the next episode will be on par with what I've always expected the show to be. But there's only a few episodes left to reach that expectation, and I'm afraid that I'm just going to feel disappointment in the end. It's not a good thing when a viewer of a show doesn't care about the characters and/or what happens to them. It's even worse when the viewer is annoyed by those same characters. All that adds up to a bad show. And as great as Fargo has been, it's now just bad.",

While, at least 5 episodes are a full 10/10 for me, the finale failed to spark.Starting off with strict references to the 1996 film, it talks about a psychopath who is on a mission in another city, played charismatically by Billy Bob Thornton. I loved his air & nuanced performance. Then comes Martin Freeman, out of the neighborhood Sherlock sets, as that jittery underachiever who has a nagging wife. Things start to climb up when Freeman's character bumps into his high-school friend. Next, he meets Thornton's character & boom! What follows is an interwoven plot which refers the original film.Crime has been brilliantly showcased in this series, including the finale and that is the main point. What follows next is as horrendous as the last minutes of the film. One after another, the thrills catch up with our heart's pumping pace as the characters grow out of their shells and reveal grave, suppressed expressions. It reflects human psychology brilliantly and in just the last 20 minutes. We feel sad, funny, pity, excited - for the images on- screen are brilliantly written. Music is very supportive.Yes, this is better than the complex True Detective. It is hard-hitting, folks and what more could a dark crime plot ask for a setup than Minnesota. Noah Hawley writes with his brain open and succeeds in making a point or two. His tale is driven my 2014's best background score. If you doubt that, try searching Google for the \"Mr. Numbers & Mr. Wrench\" track and you will see how nuts is the web for the music.BOTTOM LINE: I was skeptical after the first episode but now I am positive. It is 9/10 and the latest addition to the series with an anti- hero.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NOGore/Violence: Very Critical | Sex/Nudity: Strong",

Billy Bob Thornton was amazing as Lorne Malvo; a cruel, menacing assassin that operated in the Midwest. The plot is amazing and I have to give the credit to the writers. The writing is so unexpected and so witty, it is my favorite of a show that I have ever seen. The writing team is very, very close to the caliber of Breaking Bad. They write dialogue that is so funny for Martin Freeman, it is hard not to cry. Martin Freeman plays a total coward in the form of Lester Nygaard. His accent is very funny to listen to because I think it is spot-on. Other people have said otherwise, but I really liked it. The character Molly Solverson is absolutely amazing. She sticks to her guns and trusts her instincts when it comes to investigating. There are also a lot of subplots, but they are told in a very concise, succinct, and thought out way. Noah Hawley is an absolute genius!Season 2 is arguably even better than Season 1. There are more characters and some morph and really change during the course of only ten episodes. I loved the setting of the 1970's and how close it feels to the first season as it talks about Lou Solverson, the father of Molly. There are a lot of surprises that I also really enjoyed throughout the season. Jesse Plemons and Kirsten Dunst play a very convincing bored, suburban couple. I am a huge fan of Jesse Plemons and I really liked his performance. The writing is better than the first season as well. There is a huge climax in episode 9 that is absolutely unbelievable. I loved the second season more, but I feel that is more in the eye of the beholder.Season 3 has been the only season that I have not liked. The acting is superb; Ewan McGregor is amazing as two characters. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is the standout of the show I would say. The plot is just far too simplistic though. The thing that made Fargo amazing in other seasons was the 3-4 different subplots occurring at exactly the same time all building to an amazing climax, but this season did not have that. Season 3 only followed a feud between brothers and an evil, conniving business shark played brilliantly by David Thewlis. Of course things escalated, but it did not feel crazy or as haphazard as other seasons. However, episodes 8 and 9 are some of the series best. Those two episodes are absolutely amazing, but it took forever to get there and the finale was a bit of a letdown. Hopefully the finale will be revisited further down the line because I am really curious about a character's fate, but there were also a few other things that could have been handled in a better way. There were still big tones or overarching themes, which is a huge piece of the mythology of Fargo. Season 3 just did not meet my expectations, but hopefully other people were not disappointed.I suggest this show for absolutely anyone and I am so mad I have to wait so long for Season 4!

My husband and I forced ourselves through it, hoping it would get better, that it would start to feel like the rest.

I don't know how they managed to blow it so badly.The ONLY reason I gave it such a high rating is because of the first 3 seasons. Those are totally worth watching.

I don't care about the lesbians who haven't bathed in 5 years (one of whom is an Indian but looks nothing like an Indian so they have to say multiple times that she's an Indian). I don't care about the nurse, the little girl and her family, any of the mobs....I would say the most likable characters are the Irishman and the little black boy, probably because they're the only ones who display any type of genuine relationship and character development.\n3. Gaetano is literally a Nacho Libre understudy and I CANNOT take him seriously.\n4. Chris Rock is not a good enough actor to make it believable that people fear him.

I usually wouldn't take it so hard on a kid actor, but this one was too important here to ignore, the final scene of the final episode is absolutely ridiculous.Season four was an absolute shame, which doesn't do any honour to the previous.

Some of you may feel that I am going overboard with this, but I think this show may surpass even the movie on which it is based, and that is saying something.The whole cast is doing an amazing job, specially Billy Bob, i mean it seems as if the guy was born to play the role of Lorne Malvo. The quiet menacing look he gives and the relaxed confident way in which he moves about town, slowly pulling all the strings, making everyone dance to his tune. His devil may care attitude, and that smile of his. He deserves an Emmy for sure.Allison Tolman plays the slightly overweight (but not pregnant) cop and she nails it. Ditto for Martin Freeman as Nester and Colin Hanks as Gus. I have been a fan of Martin since i first saw him in Sherlock. He has that quintessence that has almost vanished from modern Hollywood. He can play the vulnerable every-man very well, but I am feel that his character will grow in this series into something more sinister.Anyways, enough from me. Just watch this show and judge for yourself. 9/10.Game of Thrones and Fargo, the best two shows on TV.",

There's excitement, a lot of black comedy, edge of your seat action- all while moving slowly over 10 episodes. You're always rooting for the underdog. Every one of those casts is perfect. Probably season 1 is my favorite of the three.Season 4- completely different in tone. Has zero attachment to the rest of the series, not even taking place with any connection to the location in the title. There's no humor. Here is my take up to episode 4: Irish gang, bad. Italian gang, bad. Black gang, good. Extreme stereotypes for Irish and Italians. In an exchange of children between the leaders of the gangs to ensure peace between them, the Italian family has basically starved the black child and kept him more or less in an attic while the black gang treats the child like family. Whomever wrote this knows nothing about Italian American culture than what they saw on bad 80s movies.In seasons 1-3 there were sympathetic characters on all sides. In season 4, on one side. On the one hand, they show the disdain WASP culture had for Irish and Italian immigrants and African Americans. The segregation and bigotry the two European immigrant groups faced is realistic. On the other, it's just ridiculously PC and I almost never say that about any show.Chris Rock is surprisingly good in this dramatic turn.",

The Coen Brothers Work is mostly Put Together in this Slowed Down Method. The Thing is, it is a Style and Tempo that Demands Good Writing, No Excellent Writing, because if the Viewer is Asked to Accept a Paused or Restrained Pace then the Dialog and Characters have to be in Full Control to Capture the Full Attention of a Restless Audience.This does just that and the Banter and Behavior of the Quirky and Lovable, the Evil and Stupid are Commanding Personas...They are all a Heartbeat from Reality that is Pulp Fiction at its Best.The Acting is Great all around with Martin Freeman and Billy Bob Thornton as the Centerpiece but the Peripheral Performers Contribute Immensely when either of these two are Off Screen.

And in my opinion season 4 is the second to best one yet, right after Season 2.It's nothing less than astounding, how they pull it off everytime: Quirky, very unique characters you've never seen quite like this. Extremely creative twists and turns happen all the time. And i'm not just talking about the usual Oh no, they suddenly killed of this character. In each and every scene you get something small you didn't expect - and those are the real gold mines and a delight to watch. I genuinely can't stop smiling at the ingenuity of every detail. The beautiful imagery is just the cherry on top and the final reason i can't help but binge this show's seasons.To sum it up: Each season of Fargo has a clear cohesive vision from start to finish.

My rating here is 9/10 because Fargo brings so many sensational things in the first three seasons that it does not deserve a downgrade due to the fourth season. Especially because the fourth season, despite being full of problems, has some wonderful moments.Fargo is simply the best TV series I have ever seen in my life. The first two seasons are brutal criminal stories permeated with black humor and coincidences typical of a comedy of errors, but full of philosophical, religious, cultural, political, social, economic and historical references. The third season still follows the same line, but with a little less black humor and comedy, and investing once and for all in the moral, philosophical, religious and even spiritual aspects. In these three seasons we can see the conflict between good and evil, the evil being represented by figures with clear references in mephistoles.In my opinion, the fourth season lost a lot of the essence of the series, in addition to having a confusing and dragged script, but even so it presented moments of historical and cultural references of great quality, the highlight being episode 9, a masterpiece, all done on top of \"The Wizard of Oz\", \"Alice in Wonderland\" and other children's stories with the theme of a lost child somewhere far from home.I highly recommend this series and I suggest you watch it trying to capture all the details, like the real natural phenomenon of fish rain, which is shown in the first season, or the Val Johnson incident with flying saucer and the beginning of Ronald Reagan's Alzheimer's in season two, as well as all biblical and religious references, already beginning with the evil speaking of the Garden of Eden in the first season. Oh, don't forget to also look in the independent stories of each season that you are watching for references to previous seasons. Ex: the second season showed you the origin of Mr. Tripoli, Mr. Wrench and Mr. Numbers from the first season, did you notice?Finally, I would like to praise the excellent work of production, direction and setting of each season, as well as the acting: Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Freeman, Kirsten Dunst, Ewan McGregor, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Daniel Thewlis are spectacular.Season 1 - rate 9/10 - Highest point: episode 6.Season 2 - rate 9.5/10 - Highest point: episode 9.Season 3 - rate 8.5/10 - Highest point: episode 9.Season 4 - rate 5.5/10 - Highest point: episode 9 (one of the best in the entire series).",

Season 3 was mostly them throwing a Wrench in the works for a fun return. Season 4 was the most disappointing as it was more of a departure from the literal Fargo location and the entire purpose seemed to be to work up to it being a background story for Milligan from S2. Given the arc of the entire series, that may well just be a shrug event because they may not return to flesh out his character any further, so all they did was tell about Rock's mafia days and only briefly even used Milligan except to show some of his upbringing in that lifestyle. It's still mostly a fun series and most folks aren't safe, so don't play any favorites.",

They're amazing!The majority of the characters are amazing and memorable. Lorne Malvo, Dodd, Peggy, Mr. Wrench! They're all complex and will make you laugh, will make you sit on the edge of your seat and might even pull at your heart strings.Every season is different but they all tie together somehow, either with characters or exploring different generations of the same family. It doesn't feel forced with the inner-season connections like other shows (American Horror Story).It stays true to the Coen Brother's style of blending bleakness with comedy and action.

Dark comedy at its finest. I feels very original and interesting. Brilliant cast, excellent storys and also with a great amount of humour. This show delivers on many levels and is a real top quality drama.I almost stumbled on this show since it is not so overhyped like many others and what a treasure to find.

I mean it was perfect!!!! Easy. Noah Hawley decided to have season 2 set in 1979 as a prequel. Where true detective failed in its sophomore season, Fargo succeeded. Better characters are introduced to us this season and just when I thought there couldn't be a better villain than in season one...the curtains lift to introduce us to mike Mulligan who is absolutely brilliant and just as good with top notch dialogue and humor. There are many easter eggs in this season to connect to the first season and a wink at the film just as the first season. This season is superior to the first and has now been renewed for a third I can't wait to see the direction and characters. Each episode is filled with laugh out loud moments followed by drama with an unbelievable soundtrack. If ever you were to label a season a masterpiece the second season is such. It's the most fun I've ever had watching TV and finding and connecting the subtle clues thrown in. This season will win Many awards and has now staked it's claim as one of the best shows in history. If you haven't watched you are incredibly lucky I wish I could binge up to date. Congrats to Noah Hawley showing show runners how you come back BETTER then EVER",

I mean, Chris Rock as a gang leader? Really bad casting.

He is doing a lot better than I thought (given the material he has to work with). Two other characters of note are Jessie Buckley as the delightfully mad nurse, Oraetta Mayflower, and Ben Whishaw, who may yet get to play a useful part in the series.Unfortunately, Salvatore Esposito (as the eye-rolling Gaetano) has taken caricature to its extreme, and every time he is on screen I find myself squirming in my seat.They should have left the setting in Minnesota, with the characters speaking Minnesotan vernacular (even the African-American ones!).

            "content": "Fargo is an anthology black comedy-crime show that is a continuation to the critically acclaimed movie made by the Coen Brothers. The well known brothers serves as producers but the creator and writer for the TV Show is Noah Hawley who did and continues to do an excellent job. Fargo for me is beautifully told stories that relies heavily on black comedy, crime and violence. You could say that they have created a masterpiece, but that's only my opinion but it's a show you can't miss out on. Some things that are just incredible is the cinematography, editing and overall all the shots. The whole team behind Fargo is talented and makes it the perfect show it is. The dialogue is something I have to comment on, you see it's really clever and meaningful but also really funny and silly. The writers did a great job, superb even. It's also heavily inspired from the movie, the silly and good dialogue that is.\nEach season has a different story and time period which makes it focus on different characters but the big recurring character is Minnesota as everything revolves around that state, its towns and such. Fargo and Kansas City is also two important characters. If we go into the writing in the show you will notice how the human characters are made flawed and likeable, realistic. You will get to see some superb performances, some unforgettable acting performances and stories. Fargo is memorable, a new classic.Season 1 really does an incredible job at setting up the show with superb acting from everyone in the ensemble and some of the best writing in television. The season starts very character driven so we follow a character named Lester Nygaard that's played fantastically by Martin Freeman, Lester is an insurance salesman who meets the hitman Lorne Malvo that's brilliantly played by Billy Bob Thornton inside a hospital in Bemidji, Minnesota following a car accident. The words that are exchanged between the two results in a murder made by the hitman which ultimately starts up the season, we then get introduced to the rest of the ensemble of characters like Molly and Lou Solverson, Gus Grimly, Mr. Numbers and Mr. Wrench. Everyone did a heck of a job, superb even. Other than the incredible acting we get some beautiful cinematography and editing. The season deserved all the awards it won but the golden globe for best miniseries speaks for itself.Season 2's story is about the Sioux Falls Massacre that Lou mentioned again and again, and so we get to experience it all and what I loved with the second season is that they reduced the comedy and made it into a superb crime show. The editing was the same quality as Breaking Bad so in other words perfection. I won't go into spoilers about the last episode of S2 but it ties the story of Fargo together rather nicely, the first two seasons that is. Season 2 takes place before the events of the first season so we get to see how the Fargo mob was formed and a lot of other things that a fan of the first season will like, seeing a younger Lou Solverson was exactly what I wanted and I was satisfied with how Patrick Wilson played him. The character is well written and as interesting and likeable as the more older and wiser, Patrick Wilson did an amazing job at portraying him. There's two other perspectives that we get to follow and it might get confusing with all the characters but that isn't the case thanks to the brilliant editing. So we got Peggy and Ed Blumquist which are are brilliantly played by Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons, Jean Smart plays Floyd Gerhardt who is the matriarch of the Gerhardt crime family which is at war with the Kansas City crime family. So the story is about the Blumquist's being caught in the middle of a gang war, and the police is of course trying to solve the murder that starts the season. There's something that will satisfy every single thing you might like, the season is critically acclaimed and deserved each nomination and each win in the awards.Season 3 is a completely new story set in 2010 and it is back being a black comedy crime thriller. The cinematography is as perfect as ever, so is the costume and set department. The ensemble cast is full of well known actors like Ewan McCregor who plays the dual roles as the two brothers who are the lead characters next to Carrie Coon's character Gloria Burgle and David Thewlis as the weird villain V.M Varga. The writing for the characters are as usual incredible but I kind of feel like this is the worst season yet maybe because of the previous two incredible seasons but the entertaining factor is high and it's always nice with a fresh original story. Without spoiling anything, the third episode titled \"The Law of Non-Contradiction\" is in a way a standalone episode because it only has Carrie Coon in the main role which. The episode shouldn't work in terms of narrative but the filmmaking behind it is simply incredible, you will understand when you watch it. That is one of the highlights of this season, the clever writing but in the end of things the storyline wasn't suspenseful enough to get people super interested or excited. I liked it though because of the acting, music and writing.",

Noah Hawley's television series is inspired by the film and begins by simply reprising all its elements, albeit in subtly reworked form: the first episode appears wholly derivative but pointless. Gradually, however, the series' specific elements take clearer shape, with Billy Bob Thornton's quiet killer Lorne Malvo the most magnetic element on screen, while Martin Freeman's Lester Nygaard gradually emerges as a man bullied to the point he no longer has empathy for anyone but himself. Yet after very many hours of television, the series doesn't really do anything that the original didn't do in a fraction of the time (when all the jokes were fresher as well).",

The story is the story from the father of the deputy from season one and i am glad they went into that story having heard that the father was shot in the first season and now we get to see what happens.Overall everybody should watch for sure season one and if you want to hear the story of the father and what happened to him then def watch season two.",

In fact 4.5 and 4.6 were abysmal, it almost made me give up on the series, but toughed it out and there was some respite in 4.7 (or 4.8?) the episode with the shootout - that was gripping TV but then normal tawdry business resumed.This led us (the missus and I) to a conversation about the unintended consequence of the anti-racism in American film and TV. The producers seem to be afraid of writing interesting, flawed characters of colour. Often times the antagonist will steal the show but if you daren't write any complexity into your characters for fearing of offending then you end up with a Ray Palpatine (ahem) I mean Skywalker, or a Captain Marvel.Anyway, I digress. Watch Fargo 1 and 2 they were brilliant. Not sure about 3 but heard good things and by all means watch 4 but it, like me, you're triggered by wokeness then be prepared for that spoiling an otherwise brilliant story.",

            "content": "The 1996 Coen Brothers film was a great Oscar winning black comedy thriller, and when I saw the trailer for the television spin off I knew it was going to be a big hit, I was definitely up for seeing more wood chipper inspired deaths or other violent activities in the snowy surroundings. Basically set in 2006, drifter and hired killer Lorne Malvo (Billy Bob Thornton) is passing through the snowy town of Bemidji, Minnesota, he comes from Fargo, North Dakota, he is conning God believing and wealthy businessman Stavros Milos (Oliver Platt) into paying a high amount of money to stop him ruining his fortunes and killing anyone close to him. While passing through he gets into a discussion with insurance salesman Lester Nygaard (Martin Freeman), following this exchange Malvo murders the man who has been bullying him, and he helps him cover up the murder of Lester's wife, and the chief of police who Malvo killed. Deputy police officer Molly Solverson (Allison Tolman) against the authority of Police Chief Bill Oswalt (Bob Odenkirk) is investigating the series of murder that are occurring, thinking that Lester is somehow connected to the killer, and Duluth police officer, later turned postman, Gus Grimly (Colin Hanks, Tom's son) becomes involved after being threatened in an encounter with Malvo. Throughout the series Malvo continues his killing spree, both while hired and anyone who gets in his way, Lester becomes increasingly desperate and demented as he tries to hide his connections to the crimes, Molly and Gus get closer as they work together, marrying and Molly being heavily pregnant, and they are often sidetracked from trying to find and catch the killer, and we also see FBI agents and hit men getting involved with these occurrences. Also starring Nashville's Keith Carradine as Lou Solverson, White House Down's Joey King as Greta Grimly, Russell Harvard as Mr. Wrench, Joshua Close as Chaz Nygaard, Adam Goldberg as Mr. Numbers, Susan Park as Linda Park, The Perks of Being a Wallflower's Kate Walsh as Gina Hess, Keegan-Michael Key as FBI Agent Pepper, Jordan Peele as FBI Agent Budge, Gordon S. Miller as Dmitri Milos, Spencer Drever as Gordo Nygaard and Kevin O'Grady as Sam Hess. Thornton is astonishing as the malicious and seemingly untouchable killer, Freeman putting on a perfect American perfect is great as the ordinary man stuck in the middle and weaselling his way out of it, Tolman is fantastic as the female police officer who is ignored while being right and determined to solve the case, and Hanks is terrific as the police officer also tested as he tries to help the dangerous man he encountered. The series was really gripping with the frequent and always over the top sequences, including a blood shower, a store swarmed with locusts, an unseen gun slaughter going through a building, a shooting in a lift, and many more bloody and over the top moments, it was this mixed with the investigation and hiding secrets plot lines that kept me watching and loving it to the end, I am not surprised they are considering a second season, it is a brilliant dark comedy-crime drama television show. Very good!",

It has the most grotesque villain of all and, to me, the most sympathetic heroine, but also the greatest moral ambiguity in the way we're led to sympathise with even some of the most badly behaved characters. Maybe I like it best, though, for its feeling of elegy and decay, a dreary, cold funereal quality composed of sad greys and maroons - culminating in the disturbing purple-brown moulded jell-o that is the last thing Emmit sees before he dies. It's like a requiem for America and the necrosis is directly linked to the global financial system and the actual decay that's wrought.That's in some contrast to the previous seasons, which, for all their ghoulishness, so insistently seem to affirm the triumph of good wholesome American values in particular, over evil. As much as I enjoyed every season, that felt a bit like a betrayal, even a hijacking of the Coen Brothers own sense of complexity, doubt and irony. Fnally, it's doubt that is explicitly affirmed in this season by the heroine Gloria Burgle, not as a reason for defeatism, but, precisely the opposite, a reason to ask questions - including the question of whether the decay can be reversed.",

            "content": "I loved the original Fargo the movie. However I hated the more recent No Country For Old Man, directed by Coen bros too. So my expectations for this remake is 50% hopeful 50% cynical. I'm up to date with the latest episode, here's my feedback...(edit) 19/06 Just watched the finale. Non-spoiler updated bits at the bottom.Good news is, Alison Tolman did not disappoint as the female lead. Totally in character, totally giving and unaffected as an actor. Colin Hanks and Bob Odenkirk of Breaking Bad are also well-casted, played their role very convincingly, with just the right note and intensity.Bad news, Billy Bob's portrait of Malvo, though convincing as the chief villain, is OVERLY painted as a character by the writer and director - too petty and anal in a juvenile text-book sociopath way, like the creative team is trying to jam every psychology textbook bad behaviors onto one Look He Is SO BAD person. End result is a supposedly-vicious and super-intelligent villain who is tedious and over-complicated, who would've self-sabotaged his petty self to death before he turned 30. The movie version of him was a lot more consistent, focused, complicated yet logical, hence convincing, and truly menacing.Martin Freeman did his accent OK, but overacts like the recent crop of English actors appearing on Newsroom - their animated-ness too English slapstick, and jarring. More importantly, both the villains are really NOT that interesting, no matter how they try to spin it. Evil, no matter how it complicates people's lives, is ultimately banal, and once the motive is shown, we need to move on to ACTIONS and CONSEQUENCE. The story has two key villains and 2 good guys, but the Noah Hawley team of writers waste 80% of their energy on DESCRIBING the bad guys - their personal habits and obsessions, their lone thoughts and musings, their mundane tastes even toilet habits. Character description does not a story make. Coen brothers of Noah Hawley don't seem to notice how far they have strayed. They became as pointless as the amount of blood and gore spilled behind their cameras.Deep into the story we still don't know our lead gal that well, except how passive and reactive she supposed is. Very unlike the movie version of the same character played by Frances Mcdormand, a clearly-defined and fully-grown character who dominated the screen and drove the story from start to end. Alison Tolman may not be a top-biller but she is clearly an equal - or more worthy of screen presence than Billy Bob and Martin Freeman. No Country For Old Man, really? Movie and TV land continue to be No Place For Typical Women - even when in the original real life story it was the very pregnant woman who led and changed and fixed and cleaned up everything the men screwed up. If the movie dramatized the real story by a factor of 2X, this TV version went for 10X total liberty. Failure to be consistently realistic diminished this version of Fargo, and turned into run-of-the-mill cop show showcasing human depravity for the sake of it, and make the disclaimer \"respect to the victims and family\" yadda yadda totally meaningless, even insulting. I would have given this a 9 for Alison, Hanks, Odenkirk, and overall \"worthy of telling\" real life story. But minus 3 points for the excessive grotesque for its own sake images that Coen brothers have taken to enjoy shoving at their audience, the whole writing/directing team's autistic preoccupation with banal and boring baddies, and the minimization of the true driving force of Fargo, the far more interesting lead female character.update 19/06The annoying Billy Bob's Malvo villain character got more annoying as the story progressed - more Malvo's petty and passive-aggressive bullying of your average goodie two shoes family sort. More Malvo's impulsive and wasteful killing of his money-scheme victims, more Malvo's irrational killing of people NOT WORTH killing if one is to avoid complicating one's agenda or increasing risk of being caught. And the totally inefficient, totally stupid decision to repeatedly NOT KILL those he's supposed to kill long time ago. Malvo of Fargo remake will go down as the most idiotic \"scary\" villain ever written for \"serious crime\" TV. The last two episodes are classic examples of bad writing...character inconsistency reached fever pitch, plot jumping reached grade-B soap opera level, and I haven't witnessed deus ex machina scenes so tightly packed together in one episode.If only the writer/ director don't try to take themselves so seriously. The whole thing is so SELF-CONSCIOUSLY orchestrated, from the badly attempted humor to the anal-retentively presented gore, it has no soul left at the end. I will officially steer clear of anything written by Noah Hawley, and avoid Coen brothers products with a ten thousand foot pole.If you must watch this, focus on Alison and Colin's acting, the rest, just bunch of anal directors self-consciously arranging their puppets on their self-satisfied stage.",

            "content": "I enjoyed the first two series but this third series was a shambles. I feel that the creators literally lost the plot before shooting and decided to have fun with the public and see how far they could push the whole Fargo shtick while making it up as they went along . Let's super-size it with our usual slow gratuitous camera shots and add annoying wrist-slashing music...and while doing that, lets detour from the plot every few episodes and have nothing to do with relevance. The public will think they're so hip for hanging in there and following the dichotomy of madness, they'll think they are so smart...that they just \"get it\"What gets me is how contrived all these unnecessary elements really are. They where placed into every episode just to be different but at the same time a lot of it went nowhere and just served to pad the series out to get the allotted episode count made. It was never about the story, it was never driven by the story...it was driven by writers contriving to overindulge themselves in their own bubble of borrowed egocentric rantings. The kind of people whose whole creative mindset is derived from other peoples work on film before them, rather than something they read, imagined or experienced themselves. Do we need another stereotypical English bad guy with rotten teeth that we have to keep zooming in on? He doesn't have conversations with other characters, his teeth tell convoluted stories instead....that'll kill some time. Let's have a relentless ruthless Russian guy for a change....oh and don't forget his ruthless Asian side-kick who doesn't talk...how original. Let's have an episode detour in 1950s Hollywood that doesn't have anything to do with the plot. Let's watch two people shoot each other and then have the camera pan over them for a year and a day and end it with a clich\u00e9 bullet hole dead centre in the forehead. What a surprise!Let's spend two episodes chasing someone who isn't a threat to your organisation, in fact they're out of the picture on their way to prison...but lets break them out of the prison bus and chase them all over the winter landscape. Let's queue-up some drawn out Fargo-style hacking, stabbing and shooting and then have them stumble into a quiet bowling alley in the middle of nowhere.In the bowling alley you'll find an old Jewish guy who seems to know everyone on the planet and likes to tell them each a story of a Soviet pogrom against his people 100 years ago. He then offers you car keys that are under the mat to escape the bad guys. Do yourself a favour and take the keys and drive away. The whole series was utterly annoying and meaningless.",

            "review_title": "Still My Favourite TV Show",
            "content": "UPDATED FOR SEASON 4:Everyone has their personal favourite show, but Fargo is undoubtedly my personal favourite show. There are many reasons why it is my personal favourite, but I guess just the whole feel off the show gels with me. All seasons are fantastic with great writing, performances, cinematography, score, soundtrack, and storyline. Each season also has a completely different story, which to me, as someone who hates the idea of sitting through shows and not being able to watch later seasons really appreciates. I can binge a season every now and then, and the story arc has completely finished. Anyways, I'll discuss each season in depth because while the style is similar they are quite different:S1: Season 1 is of course, the season that started this series off. It is most in line with the movie, with Molly and Lester almost identical to Marge and Jerry. The soundtrack is amazing as well, and the overall story is great. The cast is all around stellar, but the main attraction is Billy Bob Thornton as Lorne Malvo. He is truly an intimidating, and somewhat funny, villain. There's no taking your eyes off this guy. This feels like a very focused and the ending and storyline is very satisfying. If there was a critique i had with this season, it's that there isn't a lot of the deeper ideas present in later seasons. The time of this season is kind of irrelevant, the deeper themes are pretty much just about good vs evil. It kinda lacks the grand ambitions of the other seasons. That's not to say I don't like this season - it is still a great season. The story of a hero, a criminal and a villain is a great setup and way to establish a season. There are some especially great scenes when Lorne Malvo is involved in murder and we are waiting to see who might get killed next. It starts off with a fantastic season opening, immediately hooking you in. However, to me the cinematography isn't to the standards established by Season 2, and the ending is a little unsatisfying by how conventional it is. There are too many characters where the joke is \"listen to their funny minnesotan accents and the way they talk\". It's funny, but a little too lackluster to be great humour. And thank god the later seasons would reduce this sort of comedy because it gets stale quick. That is why for me I think this is the third best season in the series. I know people love this one, but I find it too safe to call it the best. But the great cast, fantastic writing and setting is not to be ignored. My favourite episode is probably the first.S2: This is my favourite season of Fargo. I love the expansion of Fargo, and the setting of 1970s Fargo and South Dakota. There's a lot of reasons why I enjoy this the best. The soundtrack for season 2 is a killer soundtrack. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful, and the editing is funny and entertaining. In terms of writing this is the most comedic and entertaining. It also has the most tense scenes in television history. The plethora of distinguished characters would normally distract from the overall plot. Yet this creates a constantly engaging storyline. Unlike Season 1, you never quite know who is fulfilling what role, and any character could die at any given moment. For example, the initial ten minutes might lead you to believe that Rye is the criminal character. Yet he dies very quickly. The main villain, who becomes Hanzee Dent, takes a while to get there - which in many regards is more interesting, because we don't know who will snap. It's a story about grey morality in an increasingly crazy time period. This probably has my favourite cast, with the likes of Peggy, Lou, Hanzee, Mike, Floyd and Ed. It's overall the most fun season in the series - there is so many characters that they have time to introduce new storylines when things seem storyline, and not too much to where the story feels unfocused. It introduces a great framing idea for fargo. The first season creates this idea that the first episode should establish a crime, which sets the series in motion. This season introduces the idea that the first half becomes an essential setup for what will end up being a series of murders and shootups. This is what I like - connect us with characters then do all the release. This way, we can do some basic set up through exploring characters we like, then lead to the bigger action packed sequences feeling as though there was great setup to them.S3: I have kind of changed my mind on this season since I last reviewed it. I said that out of the then 3 seasons, it was the weakest. I actually now think it is my second favourite season. In my opinion, this is the most ambitious season of the series. It may not seem like it - compared to season 2 and 4 it may not seem like such a grand story. Yet it is most ambitious in its story. Season 3 is an absolute rollercoaster of a story, turning a complete 180 on the premise. Ray's death marks the turn off this small crime scene into a villainous scheme to take over a company. It becomes grand in the sense of what this story turns into. This turns from a feud between brothers to a woman against a massive regime. VM Varga becomes the most intimidating villain because he is so actively evil - unlike Malvo or Dent, he appears to have no real opposition, and can act however he wants. The season very much becomes a story in 2010, as the fear of technology comes from the very real introduction of corporate schemers and corrupt criminals being able to take without any reprecussion. Season 2 established a move from organised crime to corporate crime, and now we see the cynicism of this. This is a story that is able to take more risks, able to take more creative liberties and have scenes that may not have much to do with the plot, or might not literally make much sense. Yet Season 3 becomes the most satisfying because it is a story of characters fighting against corruption, against evil. Yet this is the first time the answer is made unclear. Gloria Burgle, our hero, may not have won. Varga may have gotten away with everything. Season 3 examines the tropes of good and bad criminals, and places them in a world where money determines if someone can be above the law. It can be slow, and has some lesser moments - however the amount of times I've watched this season has convinced me that I love it, and it is great. My favourite episode is the last episode, possibly my favourite episode of Fargo as a whole.S4: This is the big one. This is the weakest, of course, as I'll get into but definitely no where near as bad as people have made it out to be. You'll notice that I've given the season still a 10 star rating, and this still is my favourite tv show. So I do like this season, a lot. I thought this season wasn't as good as other seasons, because it was no where near as \"flawless\" as the others. This is a season with way too many characters. I think they are all interesting and enjoying characters. Chris Rock, while initially quite strange as Loy Cannon, ends up working very well. And besides, Oraetta Mayflower, Otis, Josto Fadda? These are some great characters. Yet it becomes pretty clear by episode 4 that they should be handled better. Episode 1, and 7-11 to me are the same sort of quality that I expect from Fargo. These are truly great episodes. It is the other episodes that prevent this from being so great. 2-6 are way too crowded, and it feels like little is happening for way too many characters. The directing is still fantastic, and the cast is great. But the plot is way too unfocused. In my opinion, the story should have gone much quicker in those episodes, and expanded the better ones. For in those episodes it feels like a very long winded excuse to get to the war between the two families. In fact, it is more the death of Doctor Senator that leads to this war then Josto's father, though it is an important plot point. Yet it is again ambitious, and very different to normaly fargo. I especially love the new title sequences. I think this season is still great, and I will still buy it to watch. Yet I feel like for the next season of Fargo, there needs to be a more focused story. There needs to be a clear setup that results in some tensions that should break up by halfway through this season. Still a good season, and a great tv show. Definitely hasn't killed my love of fargo. My favourite episode has to be Episode 9, the wizard of oz episode.",

            "content": "Season 1 and 2 were perfect TV, so well done, I thought Season 3 was a little weak following how brilliant season 2 was but, it was still good TV. I feel like I am the only person who likes season 4, there are many inarticulate rants mentioning \"woke\", \"PC\", and other Trumpian rhetoric over black people being portrayed in a manner that they obviously find offensive, some even said people didn't behave or talk like that in 1950, a comment that should really need some empirical evidence to justify.There are a few things that need pointing out, (1) this is a TV show, it is fiction, it is a story being told. (2) any artist would tell you that repeating yourself and becoming formulaic is boring. So the fact this is a departure, even though it still carries the Cohen Brothers dark humour and nuances, is not an issue.\nThe pusillanimous, backhanded references to \"woke\" appear to cover a more pernicious undercurrent for the dislike of the show, I understand anyone not liking this show aesthetically because it strays from the, for want of a better word, formula, but some of the reasoning behind the cavalcade of hate is plainly worrying.Chris Rock does very well considering his bombastic standup persona is wiped from existence in his characters portrayal. Timothy Olyphant is majestic as the religious hypocrite Marshall, Jessie Buckley's Nurse is brilliant, but the stand out performance is Ben Whishaw as the true spirit of Fargo, the good heart in a world of darkness, he is exceptional and gives a tour-de-force performance.Season Four is a great story, well acted, with great twists and turns, I admit that it is a stretch to call it Fargo, and it has upset a lot of people, if their upset was purely that they felt it a let down artistically, I'd not bother to write this review, it's the sinister language of the Trumpers that really make it hard to stomach the ill-informed critical mauling.",

            "content": "Set several years after the film of the same name this series is set in Bemidji, Minnesota and features characters and events not unlike those we saw before. The action begins with a car crash; the driver, Lorne Malvo, is slightly injured and a naked man escapes from the boot of the car and flees across a frozen lake. We are then introduced to the second protagonist; Lester Nygaard, a rather pathetic individual who is still being pushed around by Hess; the person who bullied him at school\u0085 all that changes though when he meets Malvo in the hospital waiting room. Malvo suggests that he could deal with Lester's problem\u0085 permanently! While Malvo is doing this Lester goes home and has an argument with his wife during which he kills her. When Hess turns up dead the police chief learns that Lester had been talking about the man in the hospital so goes to pay him a visit; this leads to another death when Malvo shots him. The new chief believes Lester's story about a home invasion but third protagonist deputy Molly Solverson isn't so sure and sets about investigating him.This is the introduction to the story that will see many more die as Hess's associates from Fargo come looking for the man who killed him; not knowing just how dangerous Malvo is. As Molly's investigation continues she remains unable to persuade her superiors that Lester and Malvo are the killers. Her only real ally is Gus Grimly; a Duluth police officer who backed off when threatened by Malvo; the right move but one that leaves him feeling he might have done the wrong thing. As the series approaches its conclusion the question is: Who is going to jail, who is going to the morgue and who if anybody is going to get to live happily ever after?Usually TV series based on films aren't as good as the original but this is one of the rare exceptions; the protagonists are all interesting and Molly and Lester's character's develop nicely while Malvo is an ice cold constant. There is a slight link to the film but it isn't overplayed; the locations may be similar but the story is sufficiently different even though we have one weak protagonist caught up in events over his head, a female police officer investigating and a sociopathic killer. The cast does a fine job; Billy Bob Thornton makes Malvo seem genuinely dangerous but without making him a totally unlikeable character and Martin Freeman manages to make us believe the pathetic Lester could develop in the way he does. However the real show stealer was Allison Tolman who played the understated Molly in a way that made her character as interesting as the bad guys. As with the film there is plenty of dark humour and a fair amount of violence; this may put off some viewers but I suspect fans of the film will love it. The conclusion wrapped things up nicely but when it was over I still wanted more; hopefully we'll get another case in frozen Minnesota one day.",

All four parties comes to a violent clashing by coincidence, which is usually kicked start by the death of a really unfortunate buster in the episode one, and ended by the death of the unconventional loser who against all odds made very far in their pursuit, followed by the police figuring it all out. The first season is a little different, but these four elements are all presented. The true fascinating part of the show besides various well written characters are the dynamic between these four forces, and come to think of it, three is conventional, five is too much, four is just right. The writer also like to add various interesting professional killer who really likes to monologue. All kind of folk tales, fables, anecdotes have been told which would serve some purpose of furthering the plot, but are quite interesting to listen to on their own. Writers also adds tons of personal thought into the plot and dialogues, but it's quite difficult to picked up on the first watch considering the intense story going on.",

I've never watched the classic film \"Fargo\", so I didn't have any preperception of comparing the film to the show. It is just simply amazing with excellent direction, ACTING, and scene setup. Billy Bob Thornton did a great job showing a baddie with such a power of manipulation. As usual, his performance is fantastic. Martin Freeman's performance is just perfect, and he surprises me a lot by changes in his body shape, reactions, and the accent.

            "content": "Fargo the series is extraordinary in how convincingly it blends the ordinary with the mythological. Remarkably it makes little effort to hide its flaws and they are many when exposed to the light of rational analysis. Fargo is like a brilliant Persian rug which is so worn you can see the floor in places but the worn parts only seem to enhance the beauty of the whole. Characters are wonderfully developed; they are people you could meet on the street at any time and the acting is of such sterling quality that even movie stars like Ewan McGregor manage to convince instead of just being variations of their real personas. The women are strong; the villains are evil and complex, particularly one of the most fearful I've ever seen, M.V. Varga as played by the brilliant actor David Thewlis in season 3. Slimy Thewlis is repulsive and he knows it. He uses your disgust like a weapon. You want to wipe your hands when he's in the room and when he's gone, a stench lingers even though it's television not smellovision. He has an amazing mouth with prehensile lips. Where another actor might use his body or his hands to shape a character, Thewlis uses his lips which are not unlike the end of an elephant's trunk, always twitching, always spouting junk philosophy or dubious biblical quotes, in an accent you might find in the backroom of an East London pub. Bravo, Mr. Thewlis and if I had a bouquet I'd throw it up on the stage.All the Fargos are classics from the film through the three series of the TV show.",

Season one was incredible and even on par with a show like \"breaking bad\" the second season was really good too other than a couple of strange turns of events. Season 3 is also good but is without a doubt the weakest season (so far). Lots of plot holes and very sluggish pacing with a vague and unclear ending. It trades out the intense jaw dropping moments from the first two seasons for a much slower paced story of two brothers. Nothing really happens until the last few episodes of season 3. However the first two seasons Are so well done with a perfect balance of lovable and hatable characters with such well written stories that I can easily recommend this show to anyone and I'm excited to see what the fourth season will bring to the table",

            "content": "I am yet to see a few other promising TV series that were broadcast this year, but I have no doubt that as good as they may be (and some are according to echoes so far), this 3rd season of 'Fargo' will still be among the best. The ten episodes continue to explore the universe of the mid-North United States which was first created in the Coen Brothers 1996 film although for the first time in the history of the film and series the story does not happen in Fargo, North Dakota but in Minnesota. No need to worry - the place is as cold, as white, as populated by frozen infinite landscapes as in the titular place, and the story is at the same time cool and disturbing, populated with a landscape of characters that confront good and bad and bring together the fantastic and macabre with the day-to-day America. The guidance of Ethan and Joel Coen who sign as producers of the seasons is felt in the coherence of world which is being brought to screen despite the different locations, characters and casting.The good woman cop in the small town is now called Gloria Burgle (acted by Carrie Coon in a manner consistent with the previous similar characters in the series), she has now a teen-age son and is divorcing her husband who left her for a man. When her step-father is assassinated one of the murders taking place in the area becomes personal. The bad guys are divided on different levels of evil. We have the local businessmen with their local conflicts and misdemeanors. We have the corrupt parole officer who sins into falling in love with one of his parolees (acted by the beautiful and amazing actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and from here on things can only spiral down. And the the top of the scale of evil we have the agent of the mob trying to launder many millions of dollars while taking over local businesses, The performance of David Thewlis in this role is fantastic, it's one of these role and faces which one will never forget, and will probably never encounter again because the role is all composition. The quartet of exquisite acting performances is completed by Ewan McGregor who acts two brothers who are so different in character that it took me reaching the 3rd or 4th episode to realize the same actor is playing both. It is very seldom that such a level of acting happens in TV series.A lot can be written (some was already written) about the action, how it is constructed, how much role the coincidences play, whether there are big holes in the story, continuity problems or gaffes, or whether some of the shorter (the East Berlin opening, the Holocaust survivor intrusion) or longer (the full episode about the comics SF writer grandpa) side stories add value or distract the attention. In my opinion most of the material that was criticized was intentionally made as it appears on screen. Have really the stories described in the season happened in reality, as claimed at the beginning of each episode? I doubt. They are not that much credible in details, but they are true to the world of the Coens. Life is complicated, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, many times scare, we do not understand all that happens around us. So is the universe created on screen by the Coen brothers in the original movie and continued by the TV series. I love it as it is because I love life.",

Every episode starts with the on screen words : \"This is a true story , the events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 2006 . At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred\" . It deals with a drifter named Lorne Malvo (Billy Bob Thornton) arrives in small-town Minnesota and influences the population with his malice and violence , including put-upon insurance salesman Lester Nygaard (Martin Freeman) . There takes place several killings being investigated by astute cop Molly Solverson (Allison Tolman) and Gus Grimly (Colin Hanks). The chatty competent police attempts to put the pieces of the puzzle together and she is soon on the trail of the truth . Besides , appearing two hired killers (Russell Harvard , Adam Goldberg) who carry out astonishing murders . A riveting mixture of black comedy , drama , violence , gore , giggles , and some very off-kilter as well as excessive dialog , not without its dull patches . FX's Fargo is one of the best TV surprises of last year by co-opting the tone of the Coen Brothers' classic film, but still adding a unique stamp on the material . The 10-episode anthology series is putting together a terrific cast , as part of the growth of the show includes an expanded casting , this has an ace acting by Billy Bob Thornton as cold killer , Martin Freeman as botcher insurance sealer and Allison Tolman as obstinate police much more astute than her staff . Both of whom carry out excellent interpretations and imitating perfectly the flat-accented Mid-westerners . They are supported by an awesome secondary cast who give equally extraordinary performances such as Colin Hanks , Keith Carradine , Bob Odenkirk , Barry Flatman , Rachel Blanchard , Susan Park , Kate Walsh , Glenn Howerton , Tom Musgrave , among others , and special mention to Oliver Platt as a supermarket magnate . Set through the frozen tundra of Minnesota but filmed in Calgary , Strathmore , High River , Alberta , Canada . Being marvelously photographed by professional cameramen as Dana Gonzales and Matthew J. Lloyd . And under enjoyable sounds with evocative musical score , including wonderful songs by Jeff Russo . This malicious dark comedy was compellingly written by writer Noah Hawley and efficiently directed by Randall Einhorn , Adam Bernstein , Colin Bucksey , Matt Shakman and Scott Winant ; all of them confirmed that both the series and movie from the Cohen Brothers take place within the same universe . This is a nod to the way that the 1996 source movie Fargo started , also by claiming that its events were based on a true story . However, neither the movie nor the TV show are actually based on true events . This Fargo (2014) is actually the second TV show spin-off of the movie Fargo (1996). The first was in 2003 starring Edie Falco , a pilot was shot and aired but the series was not picked up. To be followed by a season 2 , it will take place around an incident in Sioux Falls, South Dakota in 1979, and focuses on a young Lou Solverson played in season one by Keith Carradine . And starred by Ted Danson, Jean Smart and Patrick Wilson have all signed on as series regulars for Season 2 of the this FX drama . As Fargo has booked some big names for its sophomore season. In addition , Jeffrey Donovan , Kirsten Dunst , Brad Garret , Kieran Culkin , Todd Mann , Cole Kitchen , Nick Offerman and Jesse Plemons are among a number of actors who have booked as recurring guest stars . The writer \u00a8showrunner\u00a8 Noah Hawley mentioned that season two would be \"a lot bigger\" than the first season , he says that the new season will not only draw inspiration from Fargo, but also from other Coen Brothers movies such as Miller's Crossing and The Man Who Wasn't There .",

            "content": "Let me be frank, reviews are useless; telling, describing certain scenes and write this and that about plot or lack of it or about character development and yada yada yada: useless. One more thing: Carrie Coon is just too beautiful (in the very root sense of the word), she's like a walking painting. Now, Fargo, how this show even exists? It puzzles me. It uses the very system that despises art and critical thinking to do exactly that, albeit via comedy and images of violence (which is one of the languages of our violent hedonistic era). It have anarchist-socialist themes, radical feminist themes, justice themes, religious themes, etc.. There's evil in the world; there's evil within us; there's justice; there's accountability for one's choices; there's punishment. Cormac McCarthy, the American author, writes about all this, always, though his last screenplay and the film that resulted from it is ignored by most critics and film-goers alike. The third season of Fargo actually makes some references to Cormac McCarthy's oeuvre. This show have more artistic density and relevance than The Sopranos and The Wire put together (perhaps rivaled by Six Feet Under), and certainly a deeper understanding of humanity and its condition than the more insular American and British shows and literature in general, including the afore mentioned The Wire (though Mad Men and Six Feet Under may be so as well). All of which make me ask again, how this shows exists? If wasn't for its joke and violent sides it probably wouldn't be produce. Would be a play released in book format by some independent printing house that nobody would read (we already read so little outside the mainstream).Technology advances. Human morality not so much. Apart form some social-civil advances that took decades to achieve and when got are quickly reveal to be a crumbling fa\u00e7ade, humans are very much the same as the dawn of the species. This is a book-length topic and as such I'll stop.Fargo is brilliant from the first scene of the first episode of the first season. This isn't a review, but an alert to people who may be thinking about watching the show. Pay close attention. There're many details in scenes and loose bits of dialogue to deepen our knowledge of ourselves and humanity in general. The understanding and the criticism of our ways is there, is not subliminal (though sometimes appears symbolically). Pay close attention and you will be surprised.",

If it's a true story, it wasn't a good story to base a series on, if liberties were taken, why take liberties with creating a disgusting villain that is totally implausible but sticking to the \"real story\" which is totally uninteresting? There is no reason to care about what happens to any of the characters. The \"good guys/girls\" don't drive any of the action so it's just a series of events. There is no shortage of quotes and anecdotes and it's starting to become tedious. But really if you're going to do something outlandish, please don't be boring. There is nothing wrong with reproducing a pattern that works and a recipe that tastes good.In Season 4 the writers decided that they didn't even care about the show being called Fargo and taking place in Minnesota or focusing on a series of unfortunate events that have murderous repercussions. Instead it's a mafia show with criminally incompetent mafiosi and gang members on both sides. Every one has their anecdotes and parables and it dilutes the effect. Characters are introduced that bring nothing to the action and the city is inhabited only by the characters with no real people around.The moral of this is that I hope if they continue they remember why they created this show in the first place and to focus the energy on plausible characters that we can care about.",

The story is intense, the need to watch without pause equally so. And the acting.. Second to none and worthy of the many awards given.Season 2 was equally well played, with an equally well thought out story with caveats abound, I had to say while not as riveted I was still impressed and couldn't walk away.Season 3, seriously; what on earth?

Gus Grimley was a wimp and reminded me of a comic strip character who actually was a wimp, Solverson was supposed to be a detective, the best one mind, but still played the part of a simpleton cop 'very successfully!!!' and I could moan load's about the other actors... I couldn't believe the script and choice of actors for the police in particular. They were made out to look inept and stupid and, dare I say, simpletons! The way they spoke with \"Oh Jeez\" and \"Yep\" and \"Oh boy\" and so on was so basic and although the storyline was interesting, it was hard to believe that it could have been true when you consider the level of acting. If the series was meant to emphasise the stupidity of a police force in the US, it succeeded - in every way.

I doubt those most vociferous critics of this latest season watched beyond the first episode, which is a shame because they denied themselves an extraordinary pleasure. Deeper and more complex than earlier seasons, number four is a multi-layered, sprawling epic which retains the trademark sly, black humor but adds real depth. And against all the odds given the racial subplots, there's a remarkable lack of preaching. Not much American TV or film has managed that recently.

The story arch of the first season is very good and the main villain is written very well and remains enough of a mystery till the very end.Season two serves as sort of a prequel to some of the characters in season one, and though it doesn't have as strong of a story and characters as in season one, it is still a great viewing experience, with a fantastic job from the cast.Season three is a nose dive, taking everything right with the series, tossing it in the dumpster and setting it on fire.\nThe story starts well, but breaks apart quickly and eventually becomes full of itself to the point that you have to force yourself to keep watching.\nThe main villain is ridicules and so far removed from reality that it becomes funny and then just dull. The plot is pointless and riddled with ungodly amounts of plot holes and \"twists\" that make the story even more boring.\nThe ending of seasons three has the appearance of trying to be clever but actually being flat out stupid.In conclusion, the first season is a masterpiece, the second is a neat story and the third is a televised abortion made by a creatively bankrupt mind that takes itself way too seriously.",

            "content": "I honestly can't recall having watched a single instalment of Fargo's previous seasons and not been willing to chew off my own arm for the chance to watch the next episode as soon as possible... having given season 4 a fair shake with the opening 2 acts, there seems little point in continuing...Whilst the period setting and wardrobe are undeniably on point, the cast of characters (and the questionable casting) all seem drawn from the Rockstar gaming camp of hackneyed one dimensional rent-a-villains\u00ae. Who are we supposed to root for when no one stands out?Billy Bob's Lorne Malvo alone in season 1 was enough reason to keep you on the hook, but surrounded as he was by such excellent company in Martin Freeman's performance and Alison Tolman's unrelenting force for good.\nSeason 2 could be considered the closest parallel to this tale of gang rivalry shenanigans (with added aliens?) but again, it was held up by such a strong collection of interesting characters from Kirsten Dunst to Patrick Wilson, Ted Danson and Bokeem Woodbine. You were immediately invested in the path they were each walking and how the intersections would play out.\nSeason 3 gave us the (not new, but well handled) twin thing from Ewan Mcgregor, and again, surrounded by some fascinating characters brought to life by Carrie Coon, Michael Stuhlbarg and the chilling vileness of David Thewlis.I've always been fascinated by how many great comedians make thoroughly excellent (and natural) actors - does it stem from what led them to become a comedian in the first place? That fragile ego that demands over compensation? A simple learned ability to inhabit any other vessel than their own? Unfortunately Chris Rock is far too well adjusted and confident in his own 'self' to break out of his shell and give us a convincing portrayal for Loy Cannon.\nAnd with him front and center at the top of this pyramid of obvious and mostly banal players, one has to question why the trademark Fargo feel, built up thus far, is so glaringly absent. Has too much production been laid off on underlings stepping into bigger shoes and such? Did the Covid outbreak seriously hamper the 'flow' of what normally lays these golden eggs for our TV consumption? If Noah Hawley is announcing this is business as usual, so be it... but I will only be giving this a couple more stabs before checking out.You're on thin ice Mr. Hawley. Yes sir you Betcha!",

I was filled with joy to first discover the Coen Bros. masterpiece Fargo was set to be remade with characters and setting reminiscent of its predecessor. Conversely I was a little hesitant as Fargo was notorious for encapsulating a dark, sardonic environment bursting with near bravure acting, and this mini series may taint the well known image it has created.But I immediately put those fears to rest when Fargo shed its light onto the screen. We are drawn to a similar snow filled landscape that is covered in a perpetual array of white desolation in the first scene, which draws inspiration from the environment created by the cinematography of the original Fargo.What really was a show stopper for me was the acting and the witty dialogue that encompassed both a dark yet humorous tone. We are introduced to Martin Freeman who plays the role of Lester, a dim witted, quirky insurance salesmen who's peculiar movements jitter across the screen. The body language and accent strongly resemble Jerry Lundegaard. Billy Bob Thornton does a fantastic job as a dark remorseless figure capable of brutal violence at any moment, just his speeches are cringe worthy. If Fargo continues the next episodes to come as pleasing as the first, we're in for a real treat.",

Plus Loren malvo is the best villain in tv history imo.Season 2 starts quite slowly however it is definitely better than season 1. The story as a whole is better made and the best episodes of this season are better than that of season 1. Also this season has a larger scope in terms of characters plot points and action.Season the 3 isn't quite as good as the first 2 however it is still brilliant. Ewan mcgregor does really well in playing the 2 leads and Carrie coon is the best police officer in the entirety of the show. Also, Nikki swango and mr wrench duo in the last 3 episodes is one of the most entertaining things to view on television.In conclusion this is in my opinion the greatest TV show of all time and hyped for season 4",

Brilliant performances are delivered by the whole cast and the bad guys are often as likeable as the good guys. It's always a battle between good people doing bad things, bad people doing lots of bad things, bad luck, coincidence and there are very few morals on show - law enforcement agencies excepted.

            "content": "I deeply regret having watched the entire season of this series. It seemed promising at first: The pilot was rather good and the next few episodes were as well- they did a great job at building up tension and after some point I just really (!) wanted to know what would happen next. But that's basically the only thing Fargo did right. After some episodes, it quickly becomes evident, that this series is completely empty at its core: From the beginning the plot doesn't make all that much sense and the longer it continues the more arbitrary and implausible it get's, it's like you can palpably feel the screenwriters making up arbitrary sh*t as they go along. While the overarching narrative in the end turns out to be a more or less protracted sequence of random events, single scenes were always completely predictable. In fact I have rarely seen such lazy, transparent writing in TV-series (I don't watch all that many, though). To clarify what I mean, take for example the villain: I'm not going to talk about anything specific he does here, but let's just say, that after the first episodes showed you how he goes about his evil business, you know for certain that this character will succeed at everything he does. He's practically set up as a god- he can do whatever he wants and will get away with it. And while he is the most entertaining character in the series this game of him doing something outlandishly brutal without facing any consequences get's shallow and predictable pretty fast. It's like watching a dumbed- down 10 hour version of No Country for Old Men without the excellent cinematography. Lester, another important character, is completely the opposite: Whenever he does something, we suspect that he will screw up. And the series teases us with this: So there are dozens of lengthy scenes were we see Lester sneaking around or the like, trying to bring us to the edge of our seat at the prospect that he'll maybe get caught. It worked the first few times- but it get's repeated all of the time (!) throughout the series and I found myself skipping a few seconds now and then, because I knew nothing would happen to Lester yet, but that the director just wanted to create tension by repeating the same aforementioned worn out formula. I talked about the story being essentially a sequence of random events and briefly want to get back to that: Namely that he major catalyst of everything that is happening in Fargo is basically the utter stupidity of various characters in the series. Crimes simply don't get solved, because police are too stupid and lazy. We just have to accept that. Characters put their lives on the line because they repeatedly act insanely stupid. And we also just have to accept that. You can just see the invisible strings attached to everything that happens in this series- everything is obviously artificial and could never occur like this. And just to be clear- I don't inherently have problems with \"unrealistic\" events in films and TV-series (if that were so, I couldn't watch any) but one has to draw a line somewhere. Here it's like the action scenes in many blockbuster-movies: You see the protagonist whirling around, beating up dozens of bad guys simultaneously, all the while defying the laws of physics and maybe dropping a few cool one-liners. Quickly you'll realize: \"Nothing will happen to this guy, because the screenplay says so.\" That's kind of the feeling I had watching Fargo. People got away with things they couldn't possibly get away with all the time; people acted like no real person would ever act. What happened didn't happen for any comprehensible reason or because it seemed logical- what happened in one episode did so just to provide a segue into the next. So even though I really watched all 10 episodes I got nothing from that except many cheap thrills peppered throughout the giant plot- hole this entire series is. Fargo is as vacuous as it gets, I really wasted my time on this one- hope you don't waste yours.",

His performance as Malvo is brilliant. No less capable is Martin Freeman as Lester Nygaard, who captures every sad-sack mannerism of a lowly Midwestern insurance salesman, and then some. Whenever something horrible happens, you can see the wheels turning behind his face as he tries to weasel out of it. I had a hard time figuring out which of these two characters is the more evil, since they are both unlikeable. Allison Tolman is delightful as a folksy, frustrated deputy, and Tom Hanks's son gets a role because he's Tom Hanks's son.The early promise of the excellent writing starts going off on tangents halfway through; the Oliver Platt plot line went nowhere, and I half expected BBT to just shoot his employer and drive off with the loot, it would have been easy for him to do that but he didn't. Then for no discernible reason the show jumps a year into the future. And Malvo, a mysterious superman who is everywhere and nowhere at the same time, who manages to change identities and slip through the cracks in the system, and on top of that be a total badass, makes several clumsy, stupid mistakes that are not consistent with his character. I have a hunch that the writers ran out of ideas for the last episode and called it a day. Seriously, Malvo doesn't pick up his gun the moment he hears someone in the house? He drives around town in a bright red BMW? Sloppy writing.This show is enjoyable for the excellent performances all around, but the plot kind of wanders and there are some unresolved plot lines (season 2?).",

Martin Freeman's character arc is compelling, although repugnant. I can see great care in the first episode, in that to it very much resembles the movie. That's a setup. Setup for the payoff to the violence at the end of episode one. Or maybe even a setup for season 1 for Allison Tolman's character to arrive at the possible parallel (or some reference) to that of Francis Mcdermottt's character in the original movie.Season 2 moves at a breakneck pace when compared to the first , but there maybe one of two plot holes near the end. And I thought the execution by the forest is in some way similar to that in the Cohen's movie Miller's Crossing. At least I thought of it right away. Not as elaborate but reminiscent of. And for me, certain character motivation is not as clear or probable. Like the native Indian's mindset near the end, which needed a voiced over - a sign of lack of clarity.Very enjoyable overall because the story is solid, focused and meticulous.

I had such high expectations of a venture co- sponsored by the Coen brothers, Billy Bob Thornton and Martin Freeman and supposedly based on a great movie. And yet I was disappointed. Admittedly, it isn't a total disaster, unlike some police series which are bad from the word GO (Justified jumps to mind immediately). Most of the acting is OK, though a bit on the heavy side, especially Billy Bob Thornton who is TOO evil to be credible, who smiles too much in such a malevolent manner as to be a caricature of evil, in short \u2013 not too credible (oh for Sir Anthony as a really frightening monster as HL). Martin Freeman grows into the role as does Allison Tollman while Colin Hanks is just another pretty face. As for the plot, It doesn't remind one so much of the movie Fargo as it does of High Noon. The Lonesome hero(ine), aided by a timid sidekick, surrounded by inept policemen (are they all so daft up North?) and clownish FBI agents battling alone against Evil. Molly Solverson is no Will Kane, but the setting is suspiciously similar and the ending is quite obvious from a long way out. On the plus side, the photography is gorgeous, the locations are magnificent (as if it matters if it was shot in North Dakota, Minnesota or Canada) and the array of weaponry is impressive. But what really irritates me is the lack of books. \"Books?\" you would ask, \"What the heck?\". Well, quite a few interiors are presented and in NONE of them are there books or bookshelves present. Not even ONE book lying on a coffee table, on a desk, on a night table. Only the omnipresent TV set which is always on, always drawing attention to itself. Is that America, home of the best universities in the world and of some of the best publishing houses or is it typical only of the hicks up North? Or, does Mr. Hawley have issues with books?",

It takes some time to get used to 'the new Jerry Lundegaard', Lester Nygaard, played by Martin Freeman, but episode one takes off at breakneck speed, so I had to make do. As much as Freeman can not touch William H. Macy, and this series can not touch the original 'Fargo', it still has a lot going for it.Lorne Malvo is a terrific baddie, coming off as a northern interpretation of Anton Chigurh (you know, that Coen baddie from 'No country for old men'), and Billy Bob Thornton does a class A job. I didn't \u00e1lways care for Malvo's (apparent, until the end, that is) indestructibility and his (quasi) philosophical rants, but he was morbidly funny or eerily intense most of the time.Martin Freeman took some getting used as I said before, but his character transformation was quite unique and intriguing to watch. 'The new Margie' and Gus Grimly formed a good couple, it was great seeing Keith Carradine again (after his unjustly demise in 'Dexter'), Oliver Platt has a great part here and there are plenty of other, smaller roles that are striking (Don Chumph!). The story of 'Fargo' is pretty unique, with a leading character doing quite the 'counter-transformation'. Those two FBI-guys weren't all that interesting though - and how they all came by Lou's diner at the same time, was a little far-fetched, as were a few other developments, such as Lester going in and out the hospital (let alone him being in the same room with an unconscious man with his head in bandages...) without much trouble.The obvious 'rehash' scenes from the original 'Fargo' felt quite surreal, but also unique and - ultimately - satisfactory. I'm not sure they should have used the same title and (at times) soundtrack, but alas. Furthermore, there were some details here and there, that just didn't sit right. For instance, how was Gus Grimly able to just execute Lorne Malvo without any consequences (he even gets a medal for it!)? As much as it would seem justifiable on some level, that is just not a realistic outcome. On a dramatic level, it felt a bit awkward to have this responsible husband (who just told his pregnant wife how to do her job by playing on her feelings - again, justifiable on some level) go out to this almost non-human enemy without any backup... and why didn't he call her hands-free from the car? - that's not responsible at all! It would have been nice if they had shown Chazz finally being cleared, also. Details (and there are more), perhaps, but still.Anyhoo, 'Fargo' (2014) still has lots to offer, of which Lester's 'learning curve', Malvo's manipulative manner and black sense of humour and the overall atmosphere (somewhere between funny, gruesome and endearing) are my favorite elements.A good 8 out of 10 for now.P.s.: what's will all the junk food?",

Most of these movie to TV reboots have either been a disappointment or just 'ok' (From dusk till dawn was a disaster. Bates motel is not great. Hannibal is okay. and many more like it.).So back to the show. The script, the writing, the flow, the characters, actors were stellar, not too mention the excellent capture of the Fargo (movie) experience. It was as if the Coen Brothers did it themselves. It is everything you would expect watching a Coen Brothers' masterpiece. Another point that I would like to make is that this Fargo proves that you don't have to excessively use profane language to create or capture the essence of the character, rather how it shows the characters' personality when they are prompted with uneventful situations. 10/10 for me. I love it and I think I'm going to watch this religiously. Super recommended. And don't worry if you haven't seen the movie, it has nothing to do with it, it is completely separate. (But watch it anyway!)I certainly hope the future episodes would live up to the first episode.",

I will admit to have found myself zoning out on it more than once. There are a lot of quiet spots in it, and if you're not paying attention during them you can lose the plot in a moment. I've had to make myself turn it off and come back later a few times. I can imagine this being frustrating for a lot of people, but honestly if you can tolerate it then it's worth it imo.

While I am aware that this is a TV show and it doesn't have to be true to real life, sometimes those parts can be frustrating rather than funny. By that I mean, this show still does have good things going for it, But sometimes the humor just feels out of place and makes the story lose it's credibility and the 'thrill' of the case being solved, because it makes things feel more like a series of coincidences, rather than a well thought story.",

When my husband got the series of S1 to watch, my snobbery wouldn't allow it - for 10 years!\nHaving suffered a major health setback this year, I returned to a bit of telly, and decided to try the Fargo series.\nWow! I was hooked within 10 minutes! A more menacing, yet very drily funny baddie than BB Thornton is unimaginable. He makes this role his own. There isn't a soul who could top his performance. I hope he, one day, returns to the series.\nMartin Freeman - I never thought he had it in him. Loved him in The Office and Hitchiker's and thought he'd found his Estuary English accent and was happy to stay put - but he nailed the Minnesotan accent as well as any Minnesotan.\nMolly - we see her grow and develop as the plot thickens. She becomes an empowered capable police officer, with a big heart.\nAnd Bill Odenkirk always provides a bit of light relief with his gippy guts!\nI can't fault S1. Now on my 12th viewing this year. 10/10. Faultless, from plot to dialogue to casting to acting. I've still not found a serial which is as superb as S1.\nS2 - back to 1979. The scatty, delusional Peggy Blumquist, and her gentle, adoring husband, Ed, get themselves into pickle after pickle. Patrick Wilson, playing the young Lou Salverson, is not only VERY easy on the eye, but so believable as a State Police Officer tracking down the killers.\nJeffrey Donovan is a baddie who is up there with Billy Bob. A misogynist who treats women as worthless...oh how the chickens come home to roost - in the funniest scenes from the whole 4 series. I cry with laughter in Loplop, even at my 11th viewing, it's so well scripted, directed and acted.\nGood to see Nick Offerson playing \"Ron Swanson\" up in Minnesota! I can easily forgive the lack of accent as he provides much appreciated comedic interludes.\nStraightforward plot, brilliantly acted by all (including a veteran Ted Danson!), and if I had two tiny niggles, it'd be Betsy's poor accent and the UFOs. Yes, I know there were sighting up there in the 70s, but it was a wee bit contrived.\nStellar performances from everyone, though. Overall 9.5/10\nS3. Superb acting from Ewan Mc and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (although I wouldn't have pegged her as having a Chicago accent?!)\nI despised VM Varga. It began to get a bit dark for me. Somewhat salacious and sickening. But that's just me.\nCarrie Coon and sidekick Donny were a great pair of small town officers, with Gloria (Coon) playing her role with integrity and sincerity. A character to warm to.\nI struggle to get through this series every time I attempt it due to Varga's gross indecency to his fellow man. He sickens me, and trying to watch him on screen turns my stomach (although I think David Thewliss is a brilliant actor - maybe *too* good for this role!).\nProbably 7.5/10\nS4. This is the series which ruins the \"brand\" for me. Awful acting by some integral players (Chris Rock especially!). Jessie Buckley owned Oreaetta Mayflower - she got inside that character's head and *became* her. Other great performances...but the plot limped along like a lame duck! Every episode, I was desperate for things to really get stomping. I was constantly disappointed. I just couldn't work out how the screenwriters could have got it so horribly wrong.\nI hope this isn't the thin end of the wedge, and S5 (if one is in the pipeline) takes us down into the abyss further. I want my beloved Fargo restored to its former glory - PLEASE!\nOverall score for S4 - 2/10, and that covers four actors only.",

The story is original, well crafted and makes you feel for the different characters.Like the 90s movie this is set in a frozen landscape with the kind, quaint characters with their Minnesota accents. Billy Bob Thornton plays Lorne a contract killer in a role perfectly suited for his comic and dramatic skills. Martin Freeman (showing so much more real acting than in the Hobbit) plays Lester a victim type who gets his own back with the aid of Lorne. Just as with Walter White, I was still rooting for Lester no matter what bad things he did. Allison Tollman plays a kind smart policewoman and Colin Hanks a policeman. Breaking Bad fans look out for a different looking Saul (Bob Odenkirk) playing a na\u00efve police chief.

I felt Season 3 was the weakest, and I see the creative mind behind it Noah Hawley is concentrating on his sub par series Legion from now. So 3 seasons seems to be the end. Even Season 2 had its moments, but Season 1 and 2 were superb. I speak of Noah Hawley because he seems to have lost the plot a bit. Legion started off well and totally lost it, as far as I am concerned, and even in Season 3, he introduced some supernatural unexplained events, that for me didn't work well whatsoever and added nothing to the story, but a moment of wondering, what on Earth is happening here ? But for anyone new thinking about watching, overall I would give a big thumbs up. Like True Detective and its mind blowing Season 1, I guess we couldn't expect the sheer genius to last, but even Season 3 despite not being near as good as Season 1 and 2, was still entertaining.

            "review_title": "Best TV Show IMO",
            "content": "Everyone has their personal favourite show, but Fargo is undoubtedly my personal favourite show. There are many reasons why it is my personal favourite, but I guess just the whole feel off the show gels with me. All seasons are fantastic with great writing, performances, cinematography, score, soundtrack, and storyline. Each season also has a completely different story, which to me, as someone who hates the idea of sitting through shows and not being able to watch later seasons really appreciates. I can binge a season every now and then, and the story arc has completely finished. Anyways, I'll discuss each season in depth because while the style is similar they are quite different:S1. This is the most similar to the movie (also one of my favourites) with it being set just a bit before the season was released, and the storyline of Lester Nygaard is kinda similar to Lundegaard's story. Yet the storyline is so different that you cannot help getting enthralled by it. Lorne Malvo is definitely tied with the best villain in the series, and of all time. Nygaard, Grimly and Solverson are also fantastic characters - and that's just to name a few. Key and Peele are awesome here in their small role, the girl who plays Linda makes you really hate Lester, Odenkirk is really good as the chief etc. etc. Compared to the other seasons, in terms of gore its pretty tame. Storyline wise, I love the unexpected time jump at the very end, and really love the whole arc with Gus and Molly. I also love the complete 180 of Lester, who you initially sympathise with, to completely hating. Also this is by far the best score of the series, especially Malvo's theme. So many great conversation scenes as well.S2. This is my favourite season so far. 1 is great, but 2 to me is just a little bit more exciting. Firstly, there is a ton that happens this season. A lot of people die compared to the first season. Secondly, there isn't really a main villain. Mike Milligan is close, but he's too damn likable to be one. Most characters are treated with shades of grey. Sure they are bad people, but you like a lot of them. So because you don't know who to root for, you're just waiting til the end when everything turns sideways when you don't know who will survive or what will end up of them. Every character is great, so my reluctance to talk about anyone is not because there bad - more because there is too many great characters. This is also the best shot season - I just love the exploitation split screen aesthetics. And in many scenes it works so well. And the scenes are way more intense and involved than in the first season. Easily the best.S3. This is definitely the weakest season, but still a great season. I tend to think that it's the worst season because it takes a lot of risks - and not all of them work out. There's one episode which is completely detached from the rest of the show - and it is a great episode, but it kinda ruins the pace of the show. I also think that Ray's death was not built up enough. I like that it's unexpected don't get me wrong - I just think that it should've happened after a little bit more development. However, I think this goes into what I also love about this season. It's dark. There are much less fun sequences. In fact most of the fun moments happen earlier on - which is a smart idea. Because this gets to the heart of the theme of this season. Good doesn't win. The cop spends most of this season getting pushed down, while Varga spends most of it rising up. And Varga is a fantastic villain. He's both very crafty and very intimidating. I love the decision to have him walk away in the end. The time jump in the end feels sad, as it should be. No one makes it out at the end of the season except the obvious bad guy. And although this season can drag, I love the ambition of it. Definitely weaker than the others, but no where near as bad as some make it out to be.",

It is truly gripping drama, and despite to different character's between seasons, the show has stood fast and actually matured in the genre with more grueling scenarios and intense exchanges.Noah Hawley's first adaption from the film in Season 1 was spectacular, exhibiting confident persona for its many characters and pushing them to the very edge of their emotions until they become genuine human beings. To envision that, you had Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Freeman and Alison Tolman acting their socks off with superb conviction, so much so that they fell into their characters like naturals, each with their own defining personality. Whilst depicting these striking events and how it effects the town of Bemidji, sails to highs above many other television series, not just in its genre, but further afield too. It's witty, it's dark and above all triumphant for not being afraid of pushing the boundaries.Now, in Season 2, I've reached the point where I haven't got enough energy to praise the entire spectacle that is Fargo. The cast is outstanding, ranging from downright hilarious to bloody terrifying (I'm referring to Nick Offerman and Zahn MzClarnon, who aren't even the main characters by the way). The direction is unique and experimental (my favourite kind), with the new method of splitting the screen to allow different perspectives for all the characters. Lastly, the writing is genius, with witty one-liners and unpredictable developments. One minute we're laughing at the best joke in the world, and then crying at the loss of our favourite character (even if he is the bad guy).If there's any TV show that deserves an Emmy this year, it's Fargo (and I don't just mean one). Absolutely stunning to watch - and I've still got two more episodes to watch.",

These stories taking place in Minnesota are all perfectly wacky, unsettling and non-contrived in its handling of uncontrollable chaos affecting the locals of Fargo.This is American suburbia told in a way that's a far cry from the atypical stories told in New York, Chicago or Los Angeles: its more neighbourly form of storytelling differs from the swashbuckling metropolitan spectacle you'd get from crime films from Michael Mann, Martin Scorsese or Christopher Nolan, and Fargo is like a crime story written for a small in-land American community affected by the typical murder-mystery scenario found in British TV murder mysteries like Silent Witness or Midsomer Murders (only Fargo does it much better).Fargo is black-comedy with teeth and just because it's darkly comic doesn't mean it shies away from the drama; if anything, the comedy comes hand in hand WITH the drama, as is the style of some of The Coen Brothers' best films. Considering this series was inspired by the 1996 film that won them the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay in '97, it's nice knowing that this series isn't a ham-fisted shoehorning of the film's mythos, but rather an unrealised expansion of the movie's world.This show is very good, very dark and very impactful in its exploration of crime and suburban life being greatly affected by out-of-hand chaos determining the fates of a tightly-knit community.Fargo is a 5/5 star marathon of storytelling.",

The mix between light hearted comedy and darkness provided by the interactions of the extras with Billy Bob Thornton and Martin Freeman.

First TV episode had more action and maybe a little less comedy in the dialogue/dialect of the movie, but the Coen Bros. influence is omnipresent. One concern I have is that if the murder rate continues (4 dead in episode 1), they're gonna run outta characters by mid-season. But let's trust show's writers to overcome this hazard. Observation on Malvo (Billy Bob Thornton character): maybe it's my imagination, but I see some of Anton Chigurh (\"No Country for Old Men\" bad guy) in Malvo. Both are obviously sociopathic hit men whose \"work\" doubles as entertainment. To wit: Chigurh shoots at the crow while crossing the bridge, the fun and games with the coin toss; Malvo antagonizes one of Hess brothers against the other with fake \"lawyer\" phone call. Later he cons the motel janitor kid into pissing in the owner's gas tank, then makes anonymous phone call to owner to catch kid in the act. My hat is off to FX for coming up with this magnificent replacement for the season ended \"Justified\". Fingers crossed that subsequent episodes are as entertaining as No. 1.

Its just great, but the part where he takes on the battle with Lorne Malvo and actually kind of tricking him got me crazy. And the ending i never expected with Grimly shooting Malvo. It was amazing with all the links between the citation of why a predator only sees green and Grimly actually solving it by killing him.Well S2, my favorite season because of the link with the story going on following Molly Solverson's dad Lou. Because of the 80s vibe this got me so hyped. The beginning was amazing and i couldn't get enough of the story's Mike Milligan told. Although the ending was a bit weak this is still my favorite season because it was so well acted and linked. The gang war between the Gerhardts and Kansas city got me so happy, but it was a dissapointment that they really didn't show any of that stuff near the end. Because the Gerhardts enjoyed me the most.And finally... S3. It was great, in the beginning i found it a bit weird with Ray just being a prick. But when Varga showed up it began, the way Emmit killed Ray was amazingly peformed. It was so nice how smooth the story was told. And the ending with Mr. Wrench coming back and helping out Swango, and as revenge killing Emmit which no one expected. The real ending with the clock most of you probably won't understand. It means that no one came to help Varga so he had to go to prison after all.Best TV Show i have watched yet and i have watched a lot. If you like thriller and action watch this!",

            "content": "Some slight differences comparing to previous seasons, however it's far from the bad reputation that most reviews have been giving it.Fargo is not your typical police vs gangster TV show, I do have to admit that I have a type of love / hate relationship with the Cohen brothers, who directed the movie that inspired this show, however I have been a huge fan of the series, they kept the Cohen elements and formula but they perfected it. The story lines of all the seasons somehow connect, but they can perfectly be seen as independent stories, since they all have their own characters and plots. Some elements are transported from season to season (the police officers that seem to be dumb and relaxed but actually make the difference, the psychopaths', the supernatural events, etc.), and you can see the \"Fargo factor\" in all of them, yet they can still be original, and all with their own strengths.I loved the previous seasons, and although I do recognize that some of the elements I mentioned and others might not be as present in this season as in the previous, I still enjoyed it very much. Let's tackle the first criticism: Fargo became a racial statement whereas its tone is usual neutral to social topics and although you can take some messages and interpretations on your own, they are more subtle. For this one again as I mentioned in previous reviews, I have no problem with the social statements, as long as it doesn't damage the show because you can achieve a great story filled with positive statements.\nThere are indeed racial topics discussed, and guess what with the current climate in the US I do think it makes sense and that part of the story for me didn't compromise at all the argument itself.\nThis season is about rival gangs, and as always how some random outsiders seem to play a part on life changing events to the main plot, we have interesting characters, bad ass scenes and most importantly the randomness that Fargo has always had.\nI do criticize some parts of it, more specifically, the supernatural event of this season didn't quite click with me - to be honest this is something I'm not really a fan on other seasons as well, but reading some of the online theories kind of eases for the interpretation, but this one felt a bit ridiculous.\nAlso, probably the major criticism, throughout the season I felt engaged to the show and the characters but the ending didn't seem very satisfying, it was blend as they suddenly started to kill off several interesting characters, it seemed to me that they kind of lost my interest on the later episodes.But again, I do feel that I enjoyed this 4th season, good acting all around, some annoying characters in the middle but still an engaging plot and a very well crafted piece of TV, it might feel a bit different from the previous, but it's clearly still Fargo!",

For one most are clearly not Italian and for another like Chris Rock's role, these actors are doing a lousy job with their roles, it seems they are trying to play up every Italian American cliche and just succeeded in making themselves look ridiculous.

While the small town North Dakota/Minnesota settings have naturally depicted predominately white characters, there have been excellent Black and Native American characters with prominent roles, and numerous, memorably fantastic female characters.Season 4 mostly lacks the quirky, bizarre characters, the smart, nuanced writing, and the originality that created so many fans of Fargo. Instead, it is an unengaging, fumbling period drama marinated in anachronisms and 2020 social perspective-whilst casting a person who has no Italian heritage in the lead 'Italian' role. (Why does 'Italian-ness' only seem to have a place in American film as mob criminals?) I'm an immigrant, and I love seeing persons of varied backgrounds getting represented on screen.

Jason Schwartzman is funny as always, but talks like a hipster guy from LA, not an Italian-American in Kansas City. Swanee the bank robber is a terrible character, badly written and ludicrously over-acted by whoever she is. Meanwhile Andrew Bird, yes, the famous violinist, totally holds his own on screen as a timid mortician. Chris Rock is good, but I can't help but think there were better actors for the role.

I knew about this TV series but only was able to view it now, in 2017, on HULU streaming.I give lots of positive credit to the series. It has much the same mood of the movie but handles it through different characters and different stories. Still it is the contrast between the slow pace of \"nice\" people in Minnesota and the hardened gangsters who visit to maim and kill.In the movie Jerry was a car salesman, in season 1 the analogous character is Lester, an insurance salesman, who in fact is even darker than Jerry and more willing to have people killed for his benefit. In the first season the bad guy who comes to town is played by Billy Bob Thornton.There is even a pregnant lady cop, there is a car with 'DLR' plates, there is a showdown at the secluded cottage in the winter snow. Lou Solverson is the older, retired Minnesota State Trooper. His daughter Molly is on the police force. The stories take place in relatively modern times.Season 2 is essentially a prequel to season 1. It takes place in 1979 and Lou Solverson (Patrick Wilson) is a 40-ish State Trooper with a sick wife and Molly is his young daughter. The series focuses on a dim-witted hairdresser (Kirsten Dunst) who wants to better herself and after an accident on a snowy road ends up in the middle of a war between two crime families.The series does feature its share of graphic violence but in the end the good guys manage to prevail. I watch it on HULU streaming so I may need to wait 6 months or a year to get to season 3.Edit January 2019: I just finished season 3 on a 4 disc DVD set from my public library. Episodes are set in 1980 and 1981, featuring Ewan McGregor as both feuding brothers, a parking lot magnate and in makeup as his slightly younger brother, a parole officer who gets into a relationship with one of his parolees. The big thorn is the Brit who comes to town to usurp the parking lot business and use it for money laundering. As we have come to expect the stories are very dark and many people die over the course of the season.",

While it is unfair for me to expect the show to measure up to the Coen Brothers' masterpiece, I was hoping for more.The show starts out promising. While I was a bit put off at the show's failure to use the original Carter Burwell score, I was intrigued by the cinematography, and the show's parallels with the movie. The show places the viewer in the Fargo universe as we came to know it from the movie. While the accents are uneven throughout, some good performances come through, particularly from Billy Bob Thornton and Oliver Platt. The first half of season 1 had me wanting more.Alas, the show erodes into a gratuitously violent, semi-pornographic mess when all is said and done. Season 1 leaves more loose ends than I can remember. And to say the ending is anti-climactic is an understatement. Television needs to remember that it's viewers are intelligent people. We crave real character development and a rich, well developed story. A high body count and gratuitous violence, without any real humanity, fails to capture the spirit that made the movie great.",

Most of it is ridiculously, pointlessly violent, almost on a Game of Thrones territory, where it seems that people get killed indiscriminately just to \"sex up\" the plot. Everyone on the show is a shallow, nihilistic piece of trash who has no soul whatsoever. There was an odd charm to the movie that is nowhere to be found in this TV show. The Coens had a flair for funny, deadpan dialogue (despite its smarminess) in the original movie, and the dialogue in the show is just plain nasty and ugly. It's nowhere as clever as it thinks it is. Here it's a bunch of characters acting all heartless and macho without any intelligence or comedy. Just pointless death after pointless death. Soon, they'll be nobody in Fargo because the writers will have killed everyone off.And anyone claiming this is the greatest TV show ever made obviously hasn't seen that much TV.",

Just an angelic film with top-level acting, music, and camerawork. But it does have it's issues:Season 1: Billy Bob Thorton was hands down the best part of the season. Watching Lorne Malvo (Thorton) manipulate everyone was delightful. Unfortunately, despite great performances by the cast, Malvo was the only exciting character. Cameos like Key and Peele were a bit of a distraction, but I still had a blast.Season 2: My favorite season so far. The war between The Gerhardts and Mike Milligan (Bokeem Woodbine) was the perfect blend of excitment, tragedy, and hilarity. Peggy (Kirsten Dunst) and her husband (Jesse Plemons) were wonderful. In fact, all of the characters were appealing and memorable.Season 3: It's a dark, complicated, funny caper involving twin brothers (played very well by Ewan McGregor). There were a few phenomenal scenes (the animated story of the little robot was one of the series's best moments) and a few awkward scenes (the drug test montage was very out-of-place and disgusting). The characters weren't as good as season 2's characters, but they're still good. Generally, the quality of the show is starting to go down a little.Season 4: Not a terrible season, but something was definitely off. You'd think a battle between two crime families during the 1950s would be more captivating, but I was slightly bored. Chris Rock and Jason Schwartzman as crime bosses was odd to begin with, but it could've worked. Every scene was like a contest to see who's the most profound.Despite my issues, Fargo is still way better than 99% of the shows on television. Please watch this incredible show.",

            "content": "One of the most interesting shows on television tells a new story for the third season that reflects the themes of the other seasons and the brilliant movie that shares its name. Ray and Emit Stussy (Ewan McGregor in both roles) are brothers living out a childhood rivalry through adulthood primarily over a rare stamp. Ray wants money from his more successful brother Emit so that he can marry his new girlfriend and a parolee Nikki Swango (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Ray is a parole officer complicating his relationship with Nikki but they need money to compete in a bridge tournament across the state border. Emit and his business partner Sy Feltz (Michael Stuhlbarg) are ready to pay off an under-the-table loan but the corrupt leader of the lending company V.M. Varga (David Thewlis) won't let them. Varga insists that Emit must work with him to launder money. Ray ask another parolee Maurice Lefay (Scoot McNairy) to kill his brother but the stoner isn't able to figure out the right address and kills an old man with the same name. The old man happened to be the stepfather of Chief Gloria Burgle (Carrie Coon) who starts to investigate the murder. Ray and Nikki kill Maurice by dropping an air conditioning unit on his head. Gloria's investigation leads her to Los Angeles where she learns about a young Thaddeus Mobley (Thomas Mann) and his reason for leaving the West coast. Emit and Sy try to back out of the deal with Varga but find themselves becoming more entrenched as their efforts to investigate their new business partners leads to the death of others. Varga's two henchmen Yuri Gurka (Goran Bodgan) and Meemo (Andy Yu) are especially vicious. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",

I rate the movie 10/10, and there are very, very few things that deserve that high a rating. I own the movie, and have watched it many times, and have had the pleasure of introducing others to it. Unfortunately those making this series appear to have totally missed what made the original movie great (at least for me). They have imitated the style of the movie, but have totally and utterly failed to capture any of its heart. The original movie certainly has merits on many levels. The cinematography and music are great, for example, and some of that is imitated reasonable competently in this series. However, after many viewings, I feel that the real heart of the movie lies in its characters. Almost every character in the movie is a delight to watch, even the bad guys, stupid and misguided though they may be. The TV series simply does not have that at all. Most of the characters are just annoying and unpleasant to watch. Deputy Molly comes closest to capturing the strength of the original movie. But she is not enough on her own. Her Dad is pretty good too. And Martin Freeman does a good job as Nygaard. Also Colin Hanks as Gus. But I wouldn't fault any of the actors. The writing and direction is just completely missing what made the original film a jewel to watch and re-watch. To give this one star compared to the film's ten is to over-rate it - it's not close to a tenth as good as the movie. Somewhere around a half a star would be closer to the truth. If you love the movie Fargo, I wouldn't recommend this series to you at all.",

Against all odds, the seemingly cynical approach of spinning off of a pre-existing classic Coen Brothers movie from 1996 would result in one of the finest TV shows of our generation? I didn't know; that's for sure. Fargo is amazing television and it truly feels like one of the many works of the Coen Brothers themselves; and it's great that they signed onto this series as executive-producers showing that they believed there was more ground to cover beyond the original movie itself.Fargo is a triumph in cable-television and one of the 2010s' best series. The show has a broad-enough appeal that it will probably entice people who aren't even that frequent consumers of murder-mysteries. I've watched other shows of the 2010s ranging from the likes of Game of Thrones, True Detective, Breaking Bad and even Rick and Morty. Does Fargo stand out from these shows in a profound way? Yes it does. It tells disturbing stories with heavy doses of black-wittiness mixed in with disturbing stories and characters who have plenty to hide from each other.Fargo is art-house television (if there is such a thing) that is not your typical movie spin-off. It's a show that has reason to exist like WestWorld, and it's a spin-off that doesn't feel obligated to be just a retread of the movie it's based on. Fargo steps into uncharted territory that's fresh, unpredictable and disturbing. This show is a modern masterpiece.If you love television that isn't by-the-numbers plot and film-actor-cast shows, then Fargo is the series for you. Martin Freeman is a socially crippled sociopath, Billy Bob Thornton is like Javier Bardem's character from No Country for Old Men, and Colin Hanks is a great single-father policeman just trying to do the right thing.Fargo is a limelight showing what television's capable of showing. It goes where cinema is reluctant to go. And Fargo is a black-comedy crime saga for the ages that lures you into its beautifully deceptive world.",

            "content": "/refers to Seasons 1 and 2/As the Fargo movie is one of the finest pieces I've ever seen, I was somehow hesitant to plunge into the Fargo series - in spite of noted cast and accolades. Apparently, I feared that an extended story with different and/or inserted characters could create confusions and unnecessary intertwines.But from the 1st episode, I was \"caught\" by the story-line, the approach and distinct characters and performances (particularly Billy Bob Thornton and Martin Freeman whom I have always admired and followed in so diversified roles). As the depiction of \"bad guys\" excelled the \"good\" ones, I found myself in feeling often for Malvo and Nygaard, regardless of their felonies, wishing more scenes with their presence. True, when they faced their fate, I was not frustrated, and I never identified myself with them, as they were no good persons committing accidental crimes.Season 2, however, had more interesting/versatile performances among the supporting cast - Jeffrey Donovan, Bokeem Woodbine, Nick Offerman, Jean Smart, above all, and there were less scenes I could giggle or express wow!/wtf!... But it is still a solid narration, with a number of actors in uncommon performances. References to and connections with Season 1 events provided additional value, but unlike Season 1, the solutions here based more on teamwork (local mob vs. distant mob vs. police). But the 1970ies era was well captured, and \"irregularities\" in the plot (Hanzee's motives) were quaintly included and clarified.Thus, 9 points for 1st season and 8.5 for 2nd one. Well done, and I am looking forward to Season 3.PS No. 3 is splendid as well, although the pace faded away towards the end.PPS No. 4 - slow start and uneven pace, but with some splendid performances by persons previously unknown to me. Supporting cast often more interesting.",

Maybe not flawless though, since I do think the first 30 minutes or so of the first episode felt like it was trying too much to be like the film. Not a very good first impression.

            "content": "I watched both series back to back, Fargo I (F1) immediately followed by Fargo II (F2).Do not expect realism; forget naturalism. In Season Two, the producers follow up the regional melodrama with an absurdist version.The land plays a big part in F1. Wintry Minnesota becomes a character in itself. At the end it actually swallows up one of the villains. Every character can be placed in relation to every other character through his/her relation to the land.In F2, the land recedes; the action could have been set anywhere. Ungrounded, the characters and their regional speech patterns border on quaint.The thing is, these guys are interested less in people and consistency of character than in ideas and expressiveness. Accordingly, the writers have let their satirical and sardonic tendencies run wild and created a gallery of grotesques, an array of one-dimensional baroque and extravagant types who refuse to coalesce into a whole. Disconnected and alone, no one seems to be in the same picture as anyone else. Then, too, the vagaries of the script mean that often you are left as baffled and disoriented as the actors struggling to deliver the script's gnomic utterances.Appropriately, the acting is all over the map. Jeffrey Donovan's unconvincing, and his accent seems half-way between Boston and Fargo. Bokeem Woodbine lacks depth. The bit with the lawyer standing off the lynch mob? Ridiculously stylized. I could go on. . .. Forced, unnatural, disconnected, uneven: these are the words that come to mind throughout -- deliberately, for expressive purposes.Zahn McClarnon's Hanzee Dent is a special case. His is perhaps the most interesting character, because the most powerful and most mysterious.Another source of the odd tone is the world of dreams and that's connected to Reagan's inability to relate to life except though film -- also a kind of dream. The two sleep-walkers played by Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons satirize the American Dream,.There's a lot of bloodshed in F1 and F2. but in F2, violence shorn of pity and terror by the creaky plot becomes almost cartoonish.In the end, the positive characters, unlike Keith Carradine in F1, can barely maintain enough gravity to balance the farrago of stupidity and evil on display in Season Two.",

Martin Freeman meanwhile takes dweeby Lester Nygaard to Walter White levels of despicableness - and plays it like it was a snap. There are terrific performances across the board (an honorable mention for Allison Tolman), but these two were amazing. FARGO is one hell of a series; consistently engrossing and and only gets better as it wears on. It didn't take long for this show to have me cursing the screen when the weekly cliffhanger arrived, and that one-year-later time jump was a daring move and it was anyone's guess where this story was going. This show made for top-notch television, and I can't wait to see where they go in season 2. Please let this get renewed.9/10",

The source material for FX's latest new series is a film I know so well I can quote great blocks of its dialogue word for word. My late Dad and I used to routinely quote Coen brothers' dialogue to each other in general conversation. ('Son, you've got a panty on your head!' et al.)Because I know the film so well, I'm afraid I spent the first half of the pilot episode comparing the television series (unfavorably) to the movie. What kept me interested enough to continue watching, though, were the top-drawer performances of Billy Bob Thornton as the havoc-inducing psychopath and the outstanding Martin Freeman on loan to the New World from across the pond. Billy Bob never fails to be interesting in any role he plays, and 'Sherlock's Dr. Watson nails both the Minnesota patois and the frenetic desperation of the put-upon everyman-turned-murderer he's playing. The pay-off for sticking with the pilot despite my reservations was huge. The plot developments in the third act are both heartbreaking and genuinely shocking. I can say that I'm really looking forward now to more excellent work from Billy Bob, Martin Freeman, and the newcomer cast in the role of the young female cop. Film devotee or no, the TV series has now totally got me.",

The writing changes this season from thriller to melodrama, with too many capital-A \"Acting\" sequences that drag on. A few scenes and characters were memorable and very good. But too much of the plot was lazy writing eg. A tornado appears from nowhere to carry off two main characters; and another of those shoots himself when he trips carrying a gun.

            "content": "One of the most striking things about \"Fargo,\" right off the bat, is that it looks different than 99% of the movies out there. I don't mean the cinematography, although the cinematography is spectacular. I mean the setting. The film opens looking down a stretch of highway an olds trudges its way through the snow and ice. It doesn't ramble down the road. It doesn't slide, cruise, or speed. It trudges in a way that a boy who grew up in West Michigan, constantly beset by Lake Effect Snow, and stories of the Blizzard of '78 with nary or rarely a snow day for relief.There is an authenticity from this opening shot, that we are telling a story of hearty people in a hard-work demanding environment and they aren't going to cheat this thing by shooting with a green screen. They're going to go out in the snow storm for this.I've talked before about the Coens and their ability to never lose sight, or rarely lose it, of the everyday man/woman and what a real hardship many aspects of life are for those who have not had the good fortune for things to have gone their way.Maybe their number never came up or maybe it did, but in the bad way. Either way, the Coens seem to love that kind of a character and admire them.What they don't do, is excuse them. Nowhere in this movie will you get a hint of Jerry (William H. Macey, \"Jurassic Park 3\") being portrayed as someone who should have done what he did or even dreamed of more than what was his calling. There is an irony to the fact that as a failure in much of his life he should turn to crime only to find out that failure's in crime have bigger fish to fry than being slighted by their in-laws.As Jerry's plans backfire and people start getting hurt, Margie (Frances McDormand, \"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri\"), a County Sheriff is unwittingly stumbling into a huge case on just another whatever-day morning. She's smart, kind, but no nonsense about her police work and has a warm relationship with her husband Norm (John Carrol Lynch, \"The Invitation\"). A far cry from how little Jerry seems to care about his family.The sense of justice in a Coen film, especially this one, is some combination of fate, karma, hard work by good people, the idiocy of evil, and the naivete of the sheltered. The agents of this justice may be varied yet, it seems to always be there.\"Fargo\" embodies many of the good qualities of the midwest; the value of family over money, the nobility of hard work by people just trying to scrape by, and straightforward manners and honesty as the foundation for community. It also shows the negative side, though. It shows the ambition to have more, the corruption and control of those who have more, and the inevitable violence that occurs when hardworking folk are forced to become desperate people.The warmth and harshness of \"Fargo\" are two sides of nature, philosophy, and the human heart all wrapped up with the humor that comes as we recognize we are all the car salesman and the police officer throughout our lives.",

With its pitch black comedy, mix of realism and surrealism.Fargo is a fever dream something fans of Breaking Bad and it's spin off Better Call Saul would love. If you're a fan of both shows and even Boardwalk Empire and other FX shows you will also recognise some familiar faces throughout the 3 season run. The show also reminds me of David Lynch It's is like this weird blend of Breaking Bad, Twin Peaks and the Coen Brothers of course. Most notably Fargo the film but their other material too. Season 2 seems to draw heavily from No Country. This show is great for anyone who loves great film and television I couldn't recommend it enough. Some of the best characters in television and fantastic Easter eggs for fans of each season and the film to pick up on, stellar cast with each season as it is an anthology, amazing performances, great visuals.

The police of Bemidji where the incidents take place seemed extremely incompetent bordering on idiocy, especially the police chief played by Saul from Breaking Bad. Man! that guy was a cartoon! The motive of the killer is not known except for the fact that he wants to kill Martin Freeman for some reason. In the beginning we get to see he's an hired assassins with tasks but later on, no focus is given on that organization either. It's hard to believe the story is real because honestly entire population of a city cannot be this stupid. Overall, it was a big meh, not gripping at all and kinda bit overrated.",

            "review_title": "Entertaining but a bit too convenient for its own good",
            "content": "First of all, i must say that \"Fargo\" is a very enjoyable TV series: with lots of style, drama, emotional moments, plot twists that surprise, and characters that show amazing depth and versatility. I guess for some of that we should thank the Coen brothers who created the original feature film and produced this TV series. But obviously this \"Fargo\" is beyond just mimicking its older namesake, it creates the whole new atmosphere, much more dense, dramatic, with an almost mystical sense of danger lurking just around the corner.And while i believe that all these features are major traits of a great cinema, i couldn't help thinking that the new \"Fargo\" kinda tried to sit on two chairs at the same time.One of the \"chairs\" is the comedic approach inherited from the Coens' \"Fargo\". In my opinion, almost all of the Coens' movies are comedies, although sometimes in a dark or metaphorical sense. No matter what happens on screen, you just feel light about it. I certainly felt when i watched the original \"Fargo\". It's all in the little details and whims that turn the otherwise ruthless and scary things into the funny ones: you just can't help smiling, so surreal and unbelievable is the stuff you see happening, that you just can't take it serious.But at the same time the new \"Fargo\" tried to sit on another \"chair\". It decided to be real serious, in a very dark way. Enduing the main \"villain\", Lorne Malvo, with an almost infernal, out-of-this-world image. As if whoever crosses paths with him, no matter on what occasion, is doomed to take a suffering for it.I also don't have any problem with dark movies with a mystic feeling. After all, i absolutely adored the first season of \"True Detective\" and consider it a gem of its genre. But that's the problem: the classic Coen'esque look and feel don't mix up good with such true dark stuff. I mean, of course we had No Country for Old Men, which had another infernal villain, Anton Chigurh, but that was quite an exception in Coens' filmography. It felt different. And its characters felt different, as if they realized what they are up to and were prepared to take it on.The original \"Fargo\" was an another dish entirely. Characters looked as if they live in their small convenient world with no care about what's outside. Even the criminal dudes. And that light-heartedness is what could excuse any illogicalities in their behavior. People just tend to make mistakes when they aren't focused. And while in the original film it sometimes felt like a whimsical stupidity contest, giving the movie its funny twists and turns, in this TV series one of the sides was completely serious and unforgiving.And that's exactly what bothered me the most. That it was a bit too convenient to place Lorne Malvo against those who can't get their sh@t together. A sheriff who ignores obvious evidence since he simply believes in people's best. A loser cop who finds the guy, finds where he lives and finds a competent person in the force who believes him - and yet decides to go investigate all by himself. A god-fearing merchant who stops his son one sentence from revealing a major piece of information that might affect his following actions. A desperate insurance salesman who chooses the most suspicious and stupid ways to lie about what happened, failing to create a believable story, but then all of a sudden becomes a covert ops specialist, escaping from under custody, stealing a car, framing his brother and returning back as if nothing happened. The framed brother who happens to have no goddamn alibi for the moment the crime he's accused of took place. A fitness instructor whose blackmail is uncovered by some pretty shady dude and who is forced to raise the stakes, but doesn't even think about coming clean or at least running away. Et cetera, et cetera. The list of foolish actions could be as long as the series itself.So while the suspense of this TV series does feel genuine, the ways it's created are rather unnatural. Each one of them alone could be justified by the human nature and all. But all together, they create an image as if Darth Vader decided to storm an asylum for the demented, and we are expected to consider this a challenging mission and root for the dummies. Spoils the fun.",

While it is only produced by the Coen brothers this show captures the magic of the film.The crime, the accents, the comedy and the characters are all present in full force.Each season has its ups and downs but overall, the show is some of the best TV you can get.Season 1:\nPros\n-What makes this season stand out is Billy Bob Thornton's performance as Lorne Malvo he is by far the best villain in the whole series.\nCons\nThis season does take a bit to get going however, it lays some amazing groundwork for some of the best moments in season to follow.Season 2:\nPros\n-The style of season two is my favorite of the four. The 70's is felt in every scene and it is great.\nThis season probably has my favorite ensemble cast with great performances all around especially by Bokeem Woodbine, Kirsten Dunst, and an amazing moment with Nick Offerman.The connections with season 1 make it even more enjoyable.Cons\nI think Season 2 would be the best season if not for some supernatural elements that did not land as well in my opinion.Season 3:\nPros\nLike always this season has an amazing cast.The music and score are super great in this season.Best surprise connection to another season.Cons\nI think season 3 is Fargo at its weakest, however Fargo at its weakest is still amazing.Season 3 moves quite slow in the beginning but hang on the last 3 episodes pick up significantly and make the whole season much better for it.\nSeason 4:\nPros\nSeason four does change the formula a lot from the first 3 seasons but in a great way. I did feel scared Fargo was going to become to repetitive and this season but those worries to bed.Season 4's freshness helped the story move a lot faster than any other season.I also loved the connections this season had with season 2.Cons\nThe biggest issue I had with season 4 is the character of Gaetano Fadda. It was a big character swing that did not hit for me. It felt like Jack Black was in my Fargo and not in a good way.",

I've been hooked since season 1 and have rewatched each season multiple times, and they're all fantastic including season 4.Upon cursory look you'll notice almost all the reviews sound exactly the same \"Season 1-3, Season 4 bad\" and most of the reviewers even admit they didn't even finish the season, yet are still judging it?There's also the accusations of the season of being \"too woke\" because it stars black characters in 1950's Kansas City, were they expecting the story to never address any of the problems black people faced in the Midwest during the 50's? And this season takes a pretty muted stance on this, as it's not even close to the focus of the entire season and they don't even try to push any \"agenda\", they story is literally just trying to have a modicum of truth in portraying the black experience during the time period, but to say it's \"too PC\" really misses the entire point and meaning of this season.I'll admit that season 4 is the least Fargo-y of all three seasons, and in my humble opinion it's not as good as season 2 which is peak Fargo, but it is still very good, with a fantastic cast of characters, blending the harsh existential truths of reality with the goofy and humorous qualities of human life. And again, it's 1950's Kansas City, it's a period piece, to completely ignore the differences in how minorities were treated in that time would be an injustice, and it isn't limited to the African American experience either even though the reviewers make it seem that way (another large part of the season depicts mistreatment of Italians as well as other minorities).Every season always has a great cast with some terrific performances, and the way they loosely connect to each other while still portraying new, individual, stories is fantastically done. Fargo is easily the best presented show on television, the music, settings, cinematography, storytelling, and so on is all done superbly and the symbolism and foreshadowing in each episode make rewatches a breeze, like I've said I've watched each season 3-4 times and I always notice something new!Every season of Fargo has a new and unique story to tell, and each season does it amazingly, it's really worth watching each season and judging them on your own including season 4.",

What a great season. I was really skeptical for the first couple of episodes of season 4, but oh my God, how wrong I was. Also, can Jason Schwartzman hurry up and just marry me already. He's golden. The whole cast is amazing. Chris rock was actually pretty damn good too. I was so skeptical of him in this, but everyone did such an amazing job. The story is incredible. I didn't like the scary brother at first either, but oh my God, I just ended up loving everybody at the end. You end up rooting for the entire cast; it's like there is no wrong or right, bad or good, because they're all bad people, in one way or another, and it's awesome. I wanted everyone to live; even if they were straight up evil. Such a clever show. I wish they could put this out every year, but it's worth the wait. I just want more. I'm re-watching season one through three again because it's literally that good. I feel bad for how skeptical I was at first because this season really grew on me. I was 100% invested by like episode three or four. Now I'm just so sad it's ending. Really good stuff here. Well done everyone. Please continue to make more seasons. Everyone who watched season 4 episode one and gave it bad reviews is sorely missing out. I hate to admit that I was one of them.",

Luckily, this show draws you in pretty quickly.I'm personally not a fan of Lester Nygaart's character until now. I guess this is not just Martin Freeman, but mostly writing and direction. I thought it was almost unbearable to watch him being bullied by his wife. It just doesn't seem like a couple who could have been married for so long. Why is she so mean, at the same time accepting her marriage? Even divorced couples aren't that hateful. There is no love at all which isn't very plausible. I also didn't like the scene where Lester is desperately trying to sell insurances to a couple. It felt like a bad rip off from the original movie with William H Macy as a frustrated car salesman. At least that character was played with frustration under the surface, whereas Martin Freeman was trying too hard, \"playing\" to much instead of \"being\".Luckily the writers dared to write an original storyline (unlike the dreadful From Dusk Till Dawn series), and the inclusion of Billy Bob Thorton was a great move. That guy cracks me up and is a great \"replacement\" for the original movie's bad guys.I'm curious what the next episodes will bring but generally I really likes the first episodes, albeit with a couple of weak scenes and directional mistakes.",

            "content": "I personally love this series, but had to give my honest review of what I've seen so far with Season 4. The first 2 seasons were great, and season 3 was pretty good IMO. Season 4 seems to be much better than I expected based on the reviews, and now watching it I believe the negative reviews have more to do with personal biases than the actual show itself. It's not bad, but happened to come out during a time in America where folks are seething internally with all kinds of issues, and a show starting like this adds to their nonsensical issues. I read a review who made a statement about how the bank scene could leave someone thinking that is how credit cards were introduced. We all know that ideas have been stolen and as the start of the show said, history is written by the winners. For example the Matrix was written by a black female, but had she not sued and won nobody would believe her if she shouted that from the rooftops. She also gets no public credit for it but has been compensated. I have no idea if the credit card scenario happened with other people, but the idea could have been presented in this manner and been stolen like so many other things. Even if they took license, the fact that a person would write a review with that being a gripe, and even making it clear he needs to be pc and didn't want to speak his mind let's you know where his \"issues\" lie. Why can't folks just watch shows and not be hung up on race, and try to use other reasons to mask what is clearly there.That being said, season 4 is strange somewhat like all the other seasons. I can tell it is going to be pretty good, but many may miss this season based on reviews of small minded folks, or fake movie critics hiding being prejudice. It doesn't start off with a huge bang, but in no ways is this a bad season at all. It is in line with the other seasons, and I would hope folks would stick around to enjoy it. This is not Altered Carbon season 2, which was so bad I couldn't finish the first episode. I'm a black dude, who mainly watches shows that have great quality. I don't get hung up on all the stuff other folks seem to I guess, and if it's good to me I'll watch it. I've seen and enjoyed (Sons of Anarchy, Justified, Fringe, The Shield, The Wire, Altered Carbon, Game Of Thrones, Breaking Bad, The Night Manager, Luther, Line of Duty, Gomorrah, Strike Back, La Casa De Papel, The Killing, The Boys, Bosch, Goliath, Heroes, 24, Prison Break, Boss, Power, and tons more. If I say this season is solid it's solid. Forget the reviews of small minded folks unless your small minded also. Just my take.",

I've also heard in the faint praise of others that they didn't quite get what all the fuss was about, but didn't want to say so. There's story about two critics being overheard coming out of the first screening the Stanley Kubrick's 2001, A Space Odyssey. One said to the other \"I don't know if I've just seen the greatest film ever made or I should be asking for my money back.\" Coen brother films are often like that. There is a kind of betrayal of expectation that can sometimes cause us to recognize their films as art while at the same time not being sure how we should feel about them. While many people adore films like Fargo, The Big Lebowski or Raising Arizona, many others just don't get what the fuss is all about. It seems only right then that the television series of Fargo should challenge its audience in a similar way. Don't get me wrong, Fargo the TV series is immensely entertaining. It's weird and funny and violent enough to match the film that inspired it. But you're never quite sure how seriously or not seriously you're supposed to take it. Take the opening disclaimer, the same disclaimer used in the film, in which we're told everything that we're watching actually happened, that the names have been changed to protect the innocent, but the rest is being told exactly as it happened out of respect for the dead. It leads off all three seasons so far. And at some point in every season it occurs to you that there could be no way the events could have possibly unfolded, in roughly the same two States, without us having heard about it. Of course by that time, just like in the movie, you are either too enthralled to care or too confused to care. The first season with Martin Freeman of The Hobbit and Sherlock giving us a brilliantly befuddled schnook who gets caught up in a strange web of crime and Billy Bob Thornton as one of the weirdest and most wonderful assassins you are ever likely to see, shares the film's repressed and impotent humour and its cold dark fire. It is not written by or directed by the Coen brothers, but it sure manages to feel like it is. The second season, while very good, does not quite match the wonderful oddness of that first season. This third and most recent season hearkens much more to the film in that it gives the leading roles back to women who men continually underestimate. Ewan McGregor is wonderful as the two brothers whose feud spurs the events and David Thewlis gives one of his finest performances since Naked. He is creepy and bizarre and hilariously disgusting. But the season really belongs to Carrie Coon as the charmingly understated cop who cannot let things go and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as the younger brother's ex con girlfriend who is far stronger and smarter than the men around her ever seem to realize. Coon has that same wonderful sweetness that belies and sharp determined core that Frances McDormand brought to her role in the film. And Winstead manages to be sexy, adorable and stronger than any steel girder. It is no denigration to the male actors to say that the third season belongs to these two women. There is even a very funny nod to The Big Lebowski and to one of the previous seasons. The show is superbly written and even manages to match the film for cinematography and its subtle acting. It draws you in and surprises you and it makes you laugh and gasp. The show, particularly the first and third seasons, is so good that it can bear comparison to the wonderful film that has the same name. It exhibits the same great earmarks of the very best Coen brothers films. But some of you, like my friend and the film, won't like it. Some of you might only pretend to get it or to like it. But if you loved the film, or many of the other Coen bother films, then you need to watch all three seasons of Fargo, the television series. It won't always give you exactly what you want. It will never give you exactly what you expect. But I can promise you that you will not confuse Fargo, the television series with any other show out there. I can promise you that there will be moments that you will never forget. And that for me, is no faint praise. It is great praise indeed.",

            "content": "My review is not so much a review of the show itself, but the popularity of adapting feature films to TV series. I take some caution getting involved with TV series that stem from movies for one several reasons, but the main one is: If they will able to sustain an already established story line by stretching it out over hours upon hours, and to that end, season-to-season. I cant help but feel that some series approached their writing at the onset to reflect a short run, so when we get to the end of the 1st season ( or sometimes, only half way into a season) the writers have to deviate from the original intent to find new ways to lengthen the story, sustain interest, and remain credible within the confines of the original story-line. Conversely, some assume the series will enjoy more success than it ultimately will have yet gets prematurely yanked. In those instances ( and staying within the confines of the circumstance at hand) this usually arises from too much needless minutia being addresses that may have not been possible in a standard feature film,ergo, less drama and dynamics which leads to a bored or apathetic audience. In either scenario, special consideration and interest must be made to the production costs as the very nature of some of these shows reach epic ( or near epic) proportions, so the determination of how the long or short term goals of the story-line become that much more salient. Fargo, seems to have already struck a working balance. There are already some slight differences from the movie that seem to set-up such a protracted treatment. One of the main things I'm concerned about is the frequency of crimes and murders that would or could happen in such small town over a short period of time. I call this the Gilligan Island syndrome. For such a deserted island, that didn't appear on any maps, the island certainly had its fair share of visitors: a crook, pilot, band, jungle boy, mad scientists, head hunters, just to name a few. But G.I. was a stupid sitcom not based on reality, yet Fargo producers maintain their story is real in both movie and TV series. Time will tell. The cast is very strong, but this is Thornton's vehicle all the way and he's already established a dry-deadpan, matter-of-fact unflappable character that can say as much with silence as he does with an economy of words. A lot of the quirky Coen-isms still exists as does SOME of the accents. The show is as funny as it is visceral, a real pleasure to view with a story-line that is accessible without being infantile. The directing, music and other production techniques are reminiscent of the movie, especially the music. Filming snow in a way for it to be a phantom character can be challenging, the movie's cinematographer and photographers were excellent in this regard, as is the approach for the series. I highly recommend this show to anyone who saw the original and has a disposition to this type of story-telling. I imagine this will do very well at the awards next year.",

And characters are more humane and connected to the audience, so you really start to care about them. That is because they build up the characters with strong background stories. There are lot of things happening in different scenarios and as they all are interconnected somehow it made the season all the more exciting. You are definitely going to enjoy this well-crafted season.Season 1 - 6/10 (Overall)I started the third season with great expectation because of the incredible second season and may be that is why I was so disappointed with the season. David Thewlis's performance was amazing but they used the character way many times than required which made the character to loose its touch during the climax. Apart from his great performance there was nothing else that I could be called stunning or exciting. The screenplay was horrible. The scenes were pretty intense but lacked the touch of reality. To make the scenes strong and intense directors put their utmost effort but completely ignored the effect of those scenes in the surrounding environment.And I also didn't like the supernatural component of the story which was completely unnecessary and entirely absurd.All in all, I can say that, season three could have been far more better because the casting was impressive and the story was somewhat good but the bad screenplay and unrealistic directing skill let the entire season down.",

All in all, compared to the film, I would give it close to 7 stars and improving, especially with episode 6. Despite all the extra time to fill, the masks of evil portrayed are overtly simplified rather than fleshed out. Instead, the extra hours are crafted to showcase acts of violence: violence that is varyingly diabolical, cruel, collateral and/or tragic. I concede that the characters killed in graphic detail are those that are drawn as idiotic cartoon characters, while animals and \"innocents\" have been the spared the almost lewd blood gushing effects. However, from my viewpoint, all this violence does not intrigue but instead repulses. Fargo's \"good\" and lovable characters, Molly and Gus, have short quirky chats over meals and coffee. Imagining what's going on inside their heads is my favorite aspect of the series. Colin Hanks played a not wildly dissimilar character as a Dallas P.D. cop in short-lived TV comedy, \"The Good Guys\", 4 years ago, so he feels like an old friend. Mr Hanks is perfectly cast here, as is newcomer Allison Tolman as a heartfelt and intelligent Molly Solverson. Martin Friedman, whose central portrayal of Lester Nygaard is also excellent, despite being hard to feel much sympathy for (until episode 5 when his propensity for being a victim hovers on terminal). At the close of episode 6, Mr. Friedman has the truly brilliant understated acting moment of the series, so watch for it. Billy Bob Thornton plays Malvo (short for malevolent?) mostly in deadpan, but becomes astutely animated in a wicked bit as \"The Pastor\". As the most deadly of human animal species (the brilliant sociopath), Malvo seems invincible, like a human \"terminator\". He appears to have no urges that amount to human weakness, and I don't think he ever eats or sleeps. Maybe he's too overstimulated by his motivating talents: stalking \"prey\", simulating plagues, murdering people, etc. Not to mention practicing the fine arts of humiliating and terrorizing people. (Gee, what a fun guy!) Thornton's portrayal of the aloof Malvo is uncanny; Without BBT's uncommon skills, Malvo might be just another cold-blooded maniac. Despite high marks for the lead actors, the episodes I've seen have been hurt by a deluge of clownish villains and thugs,preposterous \"biblical\" terrors, and gratuitous violence with full-screen grisly murder detail. Very low common denominator stuff. Still, the story telling makes this show worth following, and it seems to be getting more imaginative with each episode.",

Better than true detective since season 2 of that series was basically unwatchable to me. Better than the sopranos which was too long and the ending - WTF? Better than GOT because, while amazing, it just took too much energy to keep all the characters straight when you can't truly binge watch. Better than the movie Fargo because it's just as good but keeps giving and not limited to 2 hours. Just better than everything.

The story is ingenious. This series is virtuous, unique, thrilling, captivating, mesmorizing, duplicitous, dramatic, comedic, flawless, blazing, stunning and delivers cathartic endings.

Nomen omen, It deserves the same number: 4.Plot inconsistency with flaws that drives you mad. Actors much less talented. Dialogues less than acceptable. Someone wrote that they tried to do a \"pathetic version of Twin Peaks\". Well, not that far from the truth.Last but not least I strongly suspect that casting was driven by black washing purposes more than by script driven casting (aka first casting then invent a script fit for the purpose).

            "content": "When first hearing of a Fargo TV series, I did express doubt. The original movie is considered by many as one of the best films of the 1990s. And with none of the original cast returning and the Coen Brothers only coming back as executive producers, I wasn't sure about what they were going to do with this show. Thankfully, Fargo along with True Detective are the two best TV series to debut this year.The show makes the bright decision of straying away from the plot of the movie, with only a few small tie ins to the original movie. The plot is hard to explain without revealing any spoilers. But it involves a psychotic hit-man ( Billy Bob Thornton), a timid businessman with dark secrets of his own ( Martin Freeman) and two bright, up and comers in the police force (Allison Tolman and Colin Hanks). The acting is amazing in this show. Everyone does a superb job at conveying this \"small town\" American attitude. It takes influences from other Coen Brothers movies and even takes elements of its quirkiness from Twin Peaks. Without giving too much away, Martin Freeman is sort of the Walter White of the show. Someone who is fairly innocent who is changed by the events that happen around him. Freeman does a great job as does the rest of the cast but Billy Bob Thornton steals every scene he's in. There's just an unease about his character and is one of the most unpredictable characters to come out of TV in a long while. The plot is incredibly engaging and whilst the show does slow down a bit in the middle , the 2nd half of this first season is some of the best TV I've ever watched.I also have to mention the cinematography as well. It might be the most beautifully filmed series I've ever seen. It does help that every shot outside does feature snow which makes everything look beautiful. But, everything looks amazing. If you have the option, buy the series on Blu-Ray. It'll make everything look so much nicer.Overall, this is a must watch series and I highly recommend you to watch it. If you love the original movie or any Coen Brothers movie, you're going to love it. If you like crime dramas, you're going to love it. If you like dark comedies, you're going to love it. I cannot recommend this show enough.",

            "content": "Season 1 rating: 10. A bit derivative in plot, but brilliant in its acting, casting, and production.Season 2 rating: 10. The best season of Fargo so far. Plot, direction, acting, casting, all are clicking. Fantastic use of subplots involving Hanzee Dent and Mike Milligan.Season 3 rating: 8. Great characters, great acting, and production value. Plot is a little watered down at this point.Season 4 rating: 2.9. The only way Season 4 makes sense as a Fargo story is as an origin story for Mike Milligan (as a younger version of himself in the form of Satchell). Satchell's story with Rabbi Milligan is compelling and well thought out. It's the only reason I've been able to keep watching through this error-prone season.But the errors with Season 4 though.Major casting/acting errors: These errors really held Season 4 back. Chris Rock, Jason Schwartzman, Salvatore Esposito all seem to be taking turns between overacting and underacting. Jessie Buckley is doing some sort of cartoonish impersonation as Oraetta Mayflower, which makes her interactions with Etherlida Smutny, who does not seem to emote at all, very odd and jarring.Writing errors also plague this season: Many of the characters seem to be people plucked out of 2020 who exhibit contemporary values and patterns of communication. Examples include Loy, Josto, Etherlida and her parents.At the same time, the others seem to be stereotypes plucked out of 1919 (Gaetano, Calamita, Deafy, Oraetta, Zelmare, Swanee).These two groups seem to be speaking different languages much of the time. Maybe that was intentional because the 2020 characters weren't talking to the 1919 characters at all, because they were really talking to us. More to come on that below.But the unsavory result is most characters come across as either all good, or all bad. No shades of grey results in flat characters, and most of these characters wind up flatter than a Wyandotte County pancake.Perhaps the biggest problem with Season 4: Exposing every subtext through excessive dialogue verging on the pedantic. The 2020 characters do like to give long, extended speeches explaining what it is we're watching and what it is they're feeling to the 1919 characters. It makes Season 4 come across as ham-fisted as agitprop at a Leningrad dinner theater.The writers were certainly trying to make this season a commentary on race, immigration, and assimilation into America. But if the show was put together better and acted better, this prolonged verbal exposition would not be needed.For example, Josto's speech to his jailed opponents on why he can get away with crime and assimilate with mainstream America -- because he is seen as White and they are Black -- was what could have been a particularly salient moment.But it wound up coming across as a prime example of over-sermonizing by one of the 2020 characters to his antecedents, while using language that won't relate to them at all: \"Americans love a crime story because America is a crime story.\" At that point, it's clear the character is not talking to the other people on the screen. He's monologuing with the audience.You can probably get away with breaking down the vaunted \"third wall\" like that once a season. However, Season 4 broke down that wall about three times per episode with its oratory.In contrast, Season 2 did a much better job exploring issues about racism in America (with Hanzee and Milligan) without a single prolonged oratory. You felt what they felt because they were well acted and well-rounded characters dealing with discrimination.All in all, I'm still watching for Satchell and Rabbi Milligan's story. But the rest of Season 4 is a time sink. Let's hope it hasn't sunk the franchise.",

Absolutely not, and it smartly avoids any commonality with the original Coen classic beyond the setting and the tone. It is \u00ab\u00a0inspired by\u00a0\u00bb Fargo, in the best sense of the word, because it somehow captures the essence of the Coen's snowy surreal thriller and applies it to arguably a more interesting story. Season 1 begins in deceptively comfortable territory, very close in spirit to its predecessor and following an underachieving loser with a convoluted, slightly nasty scheme. Here, the winning ingredient, once you get past the perfect emulation of tone and language, is the starring combination of Martin Freeman and Billy Bob Thornton. The former's unfortunately named protagonist is less pathetic than William H Macy's inspiration, and develops a meaner edge. The latter is simply terrifying. It is a strong testament to these two actors' great work here that they manage to outshine the amazing turns from the rest of the cast.Season 2 goes the True Detective route by starting fresh with new characters and story. Unlike that other show, free from its source, it reaches even greater heights of originality, poetry and madness. The highest compliment one can probably make is that, in an age of quality television, it raises the bar significantly. If it only meets its own standards next year, the upcoming season will be a real treat.The best thing on the small screen right now.",

I loved the many homages to some of the great scenes from the movie such as the \"I changed my mind\" moment at the parking garage and the money buried under a red ice scraper. This last one and several other subtle hints lead me to believe that these events all take place in the same universe as that of the movie and that there is some continuity from the 1987 story and the 2006-07 story.

I'll break this review down by season\n \nSeason 1- 10/10. The best season of Fargo. Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Freeman and Alison Tillman, are all phenomenal, and heck even key and peele make this show better. The story is simple but unfolds and takes twists and turns that make it great. Every scene Lorne Malvo is in, he steals and is truly one of the best tv characters ever. Bob Odenkirk's incompetent police chiefs make me burst out laughing more than a few times. Overall one of the best seasons of tv I have watched. Second season 9/10. Great season. Again cast is phenomenal. Especially plemmons and dunst. The 70s backdrop also makes for some entertaining Easter eggs and references to go around with another great story of crime. One the best episodes come halfway through the season and the tension that creator Noah Hawley creates is unparalleled. My only complaint is that the finale was a little bit of a downer after two incredible episodes right before it. Season 3- 7/10. Mcgregor and Winstead shine, but I think this show lost its edge in this season. The story and characters weren't very interesting, and there wasn't the surprise factor the other seasons had. Still quality tv though. I'm hoping the eventual 4th season will learn from this seasons mistakes and create something fresh because the show's formula ran out its welcome in this season.",

I'm not smart enough to explain some of the quirky parts of the show so I wish they come out with a DVD/bluray with commentary to fill in the parts. In particular, the elevator scene is amazing. I'd pay good money to find out how they did that. On the other hand I kind of wish they wouldn't make shows this good.

            "content": "For the second year in a row Fargo has managed to raise the bar for modern Television. It is hard to compare both season due to the differences of the underlying plots and characters, however the overall storytelling, the acting, the dialogues and the deeply ingrained satire on the nature of the human actions still remains, and moreover flourishes even more as the show continues.While Season One had clear parallels to the original Coen brothers movie 'Fargo', Season Two takes those parallels into a glorious new level. It feels like the viewer is thrown into a world where various characters from various Coen brother movies exist and interact; and they do so with the same 'Coenesque' dark humor and wit, incredibly thought provoking dialogues and subtle yet hilarious references to the absurdity of the times.To name a few, we have Rye Gerhardt who resembles Jerry Lundegaard from the original Fargo; Zach McClarnon as Hanzee is terrifyingly similar to Javier Bardem's Anton in 'No Country for Old Men' while Kirsten Dunst's Peggy is at times a comical yet striking copy of Edwina from 'Raising Arisona'. These vivid characters are coupled with songs from Bob Dylan, Kenny Rodgers and T Bone Burnett to name a few, presenting different, more tuned to the 80's, versions of songs then the ones we are so used to from the Coen brother films; the UFO might be a reminiscent nod to the surrealism of the times seen in 'The Man Who Wasn't There' while the scene with Bear and Dod's daughter in the woods is as emotionally heavy and daunting as the infamous scene in Miller's Crossing.Somehow in his writing, Noah Hawley has managed to stay true to all these characters and entangle them in a story that is full of violence, noir-like plot twists and dark humor, but the one that still retains it's sentimentality. It is a rare instance where the story, the characters, and the dialogues are so deeply ingraining that one can't stop watching and demanding for more. While the performances, the '80's-feel' settings and the editing in Fargo are all absolutely outstanding, the show's strength lies in it's storytelling. Second Season's plot is a little more complicated, introducing the viewer to a larger volume of interlocking characters in an even more intricate setting. Yet, in the hands of the same writer, we receive a story that in the best possible way feels similarly to Season One, yet adds another layer of glorious complexity. This in turn gives room for plot twists that will make episodes pass in split seconds while leaving the viewer craving for more. Fargo in its essence is a dark, psychological, satirical thriller that examines the nature of human actions while leaving the reasons up for debate. It is truly the best of it's kind.",

The series is of anthology type, meaning each season will have its own set of characters and story etc and will conclude with it.The show follows a chain of events triggered by a drifter arriving in a small quite town in Minnesota and how law enforcement tries to uncover it. The pacing somewhat reminded me of breaking bad, how slowly everything comes into place and when it does, its exhilarating. The series also has this unique tone covered with a thin layer of dark humor. And it is amazing how horrific events are blended with humor etc in this show.Acting was amazing all round. Martin Freeman and Billy Bob Thornton who play the main characters Lester and Lorne, especially, completely stole the show. There were countless moments where I was just mesmerized by the dialogue and its delivery, especially by Lorne's character. The sinister and evil badass aura of Lorne was masterfully portrayed by Billy Bob, I gained new respect for this man after this show. Martin freeman (Sherlock, The Hobbit) continues to deliver great acting, this possibly being his finest.The show also had a lot of other characters, mostly great. The niceness of some main characters really contrasted the evilness of others. The unusualness of the show was that the 'Bad Guys' were WAY WAY more interesting than ones who you were suppose to be rooting for. Really made situations tricky for the viewer. :pThe show was beautifully shot, perfectly delivering the cold atmosphere where it was set in. And MAN the soundtrack was awesome, especially the opening one, a great piece.A great series that I highly recommend everyone to watch.9.3/10",

I'll watch the other season for sure but after having read some comments I might skip season 4.As for season 2, every character and subscript is intriguing and worth watching such as Hanzee's story, Mike's act of kindness and act of cruelty in the house of the Gerhardts (and he ended up in a very boring job at the headquarters), the Blumquists, Peggy and Lou's very Fargo conversi\u00f3n at the end in the police car and finally the Gus and Molly of this season Betsy and Lou and his father-in-law who's creating a language to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts among men. Betsy dreamed about the future and saw Molly and Gus with their son and daughter which was very good because they were my favorite characters in the first season.

It's amongst the best of television and kept me counting the days till the next episode.The only things that links this to the original Fargo (1996) are that its set in the same world, has similar themes and the same setting. Other than this the story is unique, following how Malvo begins to change everything as if he were rotting them from inside and tries to ruin the lives of everyone he can with little care.All the dialogue is very intelligently written with a great natural feel to it. With this dialogue comes an effective mix of both dark comedy and beautiful drama constantly putting the characters in unique situations. Probably the shows strongest players are Freeman with his brilliant descent from a quiet husband into a sinister man and Thornton who's ability to manipulate mixed with a cold calculating persona will make you shiver in your spine. Both of them give one of the strongest performances of their respective careers. Certainly the shows best moments are their shared scenes as the two share a great chemistry together which make for many intense and funny moments. On top of this the setting is beautiful with incredible shots of the Tundra wilderness and it's vast landscape throughout the show. The cinematography used is possibly some of the best I've ever seen on television with a sense of emptiness giving the show a distinct and interesting feel. It's unpredictable, tragic, beautiful and a clear demonstration of how to do TV right. I can only hope that the next series will keep to the same brilliance as the first.",

I just can't believe that the story in the show isn't over-exaggerated and unreal.

Then one day he meets an old bully, and his two sons, of his. When he made a preparative to hit Lester, Lester ran into a door. Due to this, he had to go to the hospital, where he meets Lorne Malvo. Lorne offers Lester a deal, wherein Lorne kills the bully. Lester agrees with this, and when he gets home his wife starts comparing him again with his brother, and she starts saying that Lester isn't a real man. This is the last straw for Lester. He starts hitting her with a hammer, and kills her with it. This triggers a series of events wherein Lester has to prove his innocence and run from Lorne...Now that I have told what tho show is about in short I am going to say something more about the directing and stuff. The directing changes a bit throughout the series, and you can spot some differences. But the directing is still very good, every episode. The cinematography is also very nice. All nice steady shots with here and there some aerial. (in the last episode). The music is very nicely chosen, and is fun to listen to. The music made the scary moments darker and scarier than they already were. what I didn't like about the show is that they say in the beginning of every episode that it is based on a true story, first I was impressed by it, because I thought that it was real, and when I saw that it wasn't Iwas very disappointed. The violence was realistic, so was the make up. In the last episode, someone gets a wound at his leg, this looked very real.The acting was very good. I don't get why everyone says that Martin Freeman played himself AGAIN. I thought that he was very good as lester. And I absolutely loved Lesters character. He was a nice guy in the beginning of the season, but then turned out to be a mean and dark person. The transformation of him being nice to mean was very fun to watch. The antagonist of this story is a very intriguing and scary person. it is Lorne Malvo played by Billy Bob Thornton. he was the best. I loved his character more than Martins. He nailed at being scary. The supporting cast was also very good. My favorite character was Gus Grimley. He was played by Colin Hanks. I liked his character the most, because he was the most relatable to me. He was very good too.The script was fun and very well written. The dark humor from the movie came back, which was nice. The character development was good written just as the characters overall. I would definitely recommend seeing this show. It has a very well written pilot, which makes you want to watch more. The final episode is tens full and concludes the season well.",

Much more than the movie in fact.I had to write this though because nobody seems to have a problem with the ending and I don't understand that. We had a great storyline in which the characters interactions all made sense and yet still led to surprise and intrigue, followed by the last few episodes which frankly did not do the rest of the show any justice at all.So one of the best contract killers I've seen is killed by an ex-cop that thought 'I'll just follow that wolf I saw in the road, randomly, for no reason, in the middle of nowhere'.Then he by chance finds the killers cabin, but waits for him to leave, doesn't call the cops, just sits there hoping that when he returns he won't do what he's always done and kill him to death? Then is lucky enough for the professional to get back injured, and put his gun down out of arms length? Shame, kinda ruined it a bit for me. Like the writers quit and someone asked their teen to think up the final episode.",

She was excellent. The ending in the last episode was junk. The mailman(Hanks)shoots an unarmed man multiple times and is then hailed a hero. Crap.

            "content": "I started watching this series because I like snowy locations and also love listening to the chirpy upper Midwest accent of the United States.I was rather hoping to add this accent to my repertoire but I suspect I'll never completely master it. It's way too hard. I have, however, become completely hooked on the show.If you like snow, ice, and people locked in the trunks of cars you'll love Fargo (Channel 4). There's a whole heap of snow, waist deep in many places, and almost everyone gets locked in a trunk at some point. If they ever had a car boot sale in Duluth they would first have to clear out all the dead bodies.Fargo is based on the Coen Brothers' film of the same name, but the storyline is completely different from the original movie. It stars Martin Freeman as a geeky, cowardly wife-killer called Lester Nygaard. From office Romeos to questing hobbits, Freeman has always tended to play nice guys in the past, so even when he turns up as a hammer toting murderer it's quite difficult not to warm to him.Lester's call to adventure comes when he's in a snowy supermarket car park and is thumped on the nose by an old school adversary. Our hero trudges through the snow to visit his local casualty department and like me turns out to have an extraordinary talent for standing or sitting next to nutters.I have tremendous sympathy for this trait. In my own life there's a nutter in every bus queue and a nutter in every restaurant. Only yesterday I sat next to a spectacular nutter on the Piccadilly Line. The train was packed, the nutter could have gone and sat anywhere, and yet he came and sat next to me.But Lester's nutter is no ordinary nutter. This nutter is a fully blown, card-carrying, axe-wielding psychopath by the name of Malvo (Billy Bob Thornton).Don't be fooled by this character's comical haircut and folksy sense of humor. Malvo's a violent control freak and the only thing he loves more than killing people is getting away with it. Even when the police know exactly what Malvo's up to they still seem powerless to do anything about it.Mind you, the Fargo police force do appear to be fairly stupid, particularly Gus Grimly (played by Tom Hanks' son Colin). Gus makes Forrest Gump look like Professor Brian Cox and his chubby colleague Molly Solverson (Allison Tolman) is not much brighter. The only real brains in the outfit seem to be that of Bill Oswalt (Bob Odenkirk who portrayed infamous bent lawyer Saul in Breaking Bad.) Fargo is small town Americana at its best, and the world that's created in this show is hypnotic and highly addictive. Malvo's unquenchable malice and dark humour are immensely watchable and it's not long before you are so drawn into the surreal Fargo universe that even plagues of locusts and showers of blood become as routine as a day at the office with an insurance salesman.Fargo is no doubt going to get much snowier, much weirder and much more nasty before the season finale, and I for one will be glued to every second.",

Maybe it was those little moments in the show that kept me sustained, the lines writer/creator Noah Hawley gives Lorne Malvo, delivered with delicious malice by Billy Bob Thornton in what may be his best turn since Sling Blade. These moments of transcendence, these hints at something more than man, something sublimely and timelessly evil. Maybe it was the captivating performance of Allison Tolman, understated, riveting, sweet without being saccharine, driven and imperturbable, like a good cop/deputy should be. Maybe it was Martin Freeman's ostensibly gormless but ultimately wormy, sinister Lester Nygaard. And so while the wild, unbelievable scenarios kept on, and the body count stacked up, I kept watching. I kept watching through the episode with the epic \"blizzard\" - really one of the poorer uses of CGI I've ever seen on screen. Kept watching through the silliness - like the FBI agents Laurel and Hardy routine. Kept watching when, in the penultimate episode, something happens which seems to make absolutely no sense. I won't spoil it, but it really threw me off. And then I came to understand something. It had been percolating throughout the series, but the final epiphany came with the sublime final episode: This show is about something. I won't say what, because you should discover it for yourself. I will say this: Lester Nygaard, he's not the protagonist. Both he and Malvo are the antagonists. They're equally rotten. It's Deputy Solverson that's the hero - patient, methodical, temperate, brave, loving. You'll come to root for her - and her fella Gus Grimley. Oh yah, sure, you'll come to see it, as I did, that this show is a little bit of magic. You betcha.",

It is story-telling in its truest form, sometimes you don't need words to explain something but then other times you can use words to explain something in a completely different way than everyone else does. Billy Bob Thornton does a great job with his character - he is malevolent, yet also likable. Same goes with Martin Freeman, who portrays Lester as a scared man, who was never good at anything but starts to 'take control of his life', as best as anyone could. The landscape in the show is amazing - snow everywhere so that you can feel the cold atmosphere at all times. The most amazing thing about this show is - characters that are supposed to be bad, are often likable, either for the humorous behaviour or by the things they do to help others.

The acting is great by Everyone, with a great cast. Billy Bob Thornton is amazing playing a creepy killer. Martian Freeman is great in this show ,like he is in movies and TV(Sherlock).Also Bob Odenkirk( aka Saul goodman) is in it and he plays another great role. The scenery and the score is amazing. Overall Fargo is an amazing show, with great cast,score,and scenery. If your a fan of thriller shows you should watch this show. Season 2 is about a younger Lou Solverson(Keith Carrdadine) and it seems great.FX,you have made another amazing show.",

            "content": "Halfway through the first season of Fargo, I was hooked, I thought it was acted brilliantly in many regards, and overall I felt it was pretty deserving of its gaudy nine-star rating... But sometime shorty after that my feelings towards the show began to change... The violence grows more gratuitous and graphic with each passing episode.The real problem I have with Fargo more than anything else is that it claims \"This is a true story. The events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 2006. At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred.\" The movie Fargo made the same claim, and it was also a complete work of fiction.I don't like being lied to! I don't like it when people fake the truth. Truth really is stranger than fiction, so if the Cohen brothers want to make a compelling series that's actually based on real life murders, then there's no shortage of bizarre tales that are also true... But if you want to make a work of complete fiction (like Fargo), then that's cool too.. But the Cohen brothers FAIL in both respects by claiming something is true when it isn't, and then proceeding to make the show evolve into something so unrealistic that anybody with half a brain would know that there's no freaking way this was based on a true story.Also notice the feminist propaganda at work... The woman deputy in the show is so smart, but all the male officers are depicted as either being completely incompetent, or they're total wusses... Another small propaganda angle I noticed was that on multiple occasions police officers searched suspects homes without a warrant. Now warrantless searches are a part of real life for all of us since the Patriot Act, but Hollywood still needs to do their part to normalize the death of individual liberty in America.",

The Cohen touch of humor manages to break the suspense at just the right time so that we, as viewers, don't get overwhelmed.

No, yea? sorta, OK then, etc ... and it's impressive that all actors and actresses did good performance with the accent including British actors (it's difficult to me all the same)there's a pattern in making the characters or the events ( broken relationship between siblings, a police officer who strangling with a stupidity of bureaucracy, a pure evil in culture sociopath, murder by mistake or in purposed leads to Carnegie in the end)EVERY season is a different story but they're connected somehow together, in season 3 the most powerful thing they give us when the deaf Guy from first season shows up, it wasn't waste of time after all",

A man kills another man by stabbing him in the back of the head while he's having sex. He spits up blood on the prostitute and falls on top of her. A man beats his wife to death with a hammer. This scene is sudden and intense as the first strike comes out of nowhere. She stands in shock with blood trickling down her head. He later hits her across the face and begins beating her multiple times. You later see the graphic aftermath. So there was a lot of thought put into this Series and just the best acting hands down Iv'e seen in a TV show in a long while.Thumbs up!! 10/10",

Anyone wanting and ongoing taste of excellence should just re-run the original movie once every week or two and you will have a far better feeling then watching these re-hashed series.Current rating of the Oscar winning 1996 original is 8.2 which is about right.

The scene where he kills everyone in that building was really well shot from the outside of the building all in one camera shot which meant that Thornton had to climb all those stairs to get to the window that blow out and you see him through it. Watch the show and you will see what I mean. I mean it, watch the show! Seriously, you don't know what you're missing. It's very slightly similar to the movie in that a lot of the characters are the same, but they changed a lot of it, so if you've sent he movie, you will still be surprised. Thornton plays what I think is a hit man or bounty hunter of something, but he is a pure sociopath that's for sure. He just seems to mess with people and get them killed. I know he does this for money though. He meets up with Lester Nigaard played by, who does a very good northern American accent. Everyone's accent is fantastic, especially Thornton. He does a few accents in it. Lester gets into some trouble and works his way out of it very cleverly. I don't want to give too much away. There are some great characters in it. There are two other hit men (I guess) looking for Malvo. One is deaf and the other is played by, who had to learn sign language to communicate with the deaf actor, who plays his partner in crime. Some of the things they get away with in show are surprising for basic cable TV, it's pretty edgy. Try to catch re-runs or streaming somewhere. You will be happy you did.",

Forget plot and any sort of realism, he goes around killing people and messing with police as he sees fit. Police are complete idiots who mean well. I see that the demographic I mentioned find this character a cool, rebel and badass but I personally just found him ridiculous and creepy, not in a good way. It was just way too hard to believe he could get away with all this, just going on murdering sprees out in the open. Also the characters don't have any depth or relatability aside from Lester.

I was quite a fan of the movie Fargo, but Fargo TV show looks better to me, having even more bizarre elements and overall context. I was actually amazed how god this show is, not to mention casting one the best actors from movie world. Martin Freeman and Billy Bob Thornton made an impeccable performances, but hell, all of other actors also do. Collin Hanks, Bob Odnekirk, Oliver Platt. Simply awesome performances. I liked how they made a connection with the movie Fargo, yet it is so richer in details, conversations and overall plot, mush better and unique. Bizarre, unusual and funny with dark comedy elements and real violence was a great way to make it as a TV masterpiece. Not everyone will admire though. All that would not be made so good, I believe, without legendary Coen Brothers as a producers. Their influence is obvious, and that quotes and conversations by Lorne Malvo reminds me on Anton Chigurh from \"No Country for Old Men\" (at the gas station). Every episode is made very tensed and rich, and the whole story rise to its peak that simply leaves you breathless. The ending is supposing to be like that, and what I can say is that I am exciting for the Season 2. I believe they will cast some memorable persons like it was in the first season. Spectacular.",

The cops in the show, while some are complete fools that are there for comedic effect, there are others that know what they are doing, but still do not do what a common sense police officer would do. And it was hard for me to just let those details go as I watched the show.To give an example of this: I rob a bank with working security cameras. I make a clean getaway in Chicago. The police investigate the crime. They have no idea who robbed the bank and the trail is cold. So, then I rob another bank and the same thing happens. It is exciting for the sake of a television show. But New York City has security cameras throughout the city, where the police could have easily tracked me on where I went, arrested me, and prevented the second robbery. Yet, I choose to never even mention this in the show that the police could do this even though it is common knowledge that they could--all so I could just advance the plot.",

Everyone is unbelievably mean to Lester for no reason, and Lester's turn to evil is so abrupt that it doesn't really work. It all happens in the span of one episode. These are just problems with the first episode. It tried for the same dark humor tone that the movie had, but it did it poorly. It doesn't mix nearly as well as the movie. For instance two people are having a conversation about someone who died while getting a frosty, and the other character asks what flavor frosty he was buying. It doesn't seem natural at all. A lot of it doesn't exactly make sense either. Billy Bob Thornton is caught dragging someone out of a building on a security camera, and the police still can't catch them. It also makes mid westerners seem extremely stupid. This show seems to take everything that made the movie and takes it to such an extreme that it ruins the show.",

            "content": "I don't know how I would rate this show.The first season is marvellous. It watches like a multiple hours long Cohen brothers film. I didn't like the ending so much - it felt like the script writers were out of imagination, and it didn't really feel coherent with the epic-ness of the beginning.The second season has a good story in itself (though I would have expected more bloodshed), though the editing (or directing, or both) were horrible. It lost all the gripping strange and quirkiness of the first season, and felt like \"any other tv series\". It was edited with long \"emotional\" shots, with random \"seemingly emotionally fitting\" music, and had way too many dialogues. The problem isn't only the dialogues, it's the \"characters talking about what they might do but aren't doing\". Less talk, more action. In the fist season, if someone wants to shoot someone, they just shoot. In the second season, people talk at ends before actually doing something. I'd give example of what I mean, but that would b a spoiler. Anyone who has seen the show, though, I think, will understand what I mean by long slow shots with music, that are supposedly emotionally charged, but that turn into a long bore where you wait for something to happen. I enoyed the story, and the link to the first season, but most of the time, I just couldn't wait for the characters to shut up.The third season is horrible. I'm only half way through now, but I'm thinking about giving up. Strangely, halfway through you get some editing or directing similar to the first season, but in all the episodes before that, not one scene goes by before you get the feeling you're watching a music video. For half the episodes, nothing happens, just music and shots of, more or less nothing. I was also able to predict essentially everything that was going to happen from the start. but not in some weird 1st season \"that's not really going to happen, is it?\" way, more in a very common \"oh, ok, that's going to happen. Jesus, couldn't have they thought of something less predictable, and of less caricatural characters?\" way. So far, a lot of nothing is happening, a lot of dull dialogue, no link whatsoever to the other seasons other than Minnesota (which one could ignore if it were good).I could give a 8-9 for the first season, 5 to the second season, and a 2-3 to the third season. I won't be watching more of it if I decided to finish the third season.",

            "review_title": "Season 1 - Fascinating Fiction with Some Glaring Flaws",
            "content": "I have only seen the entire season one which is a self contained story so my comments are restricted to that. * This does contain spoilers *This is a nice piece of fiction even though there are some unfortunate glaring holes in the plot. But then this is Hollywood stuff and unfortunately the writers seem do this kind of thing constantly in fictional TV series. The acting for the most part is excellent most especially from wife killer Martin Freeman and Allison Tolman(who plays deputy Molly Solverson). The performances by these 2 were just superb and the show is well worth watching just to see these 2 in action. Instead of treating the audience as mindless zombies perhaps the writers could have been a great deal more realistic with their script. For example:1. We are expected to believe a Duluth police officer would let a clearly suspicious person off the hook when he declined to provide his licence and registration papers while sitting in a stolen car and issuing threats to the officer. In reality the guy would have been ordered out of the car at gun point and told to lie on the ground while handcuffed and back up would probably have also been called in. In the real world armed Police tend not to let you go when you refuse to identify yourself and then physically threaten them.2. The Lorne Malvo character is nothing but a contract fix it and contract killer but is given a false identity for one job as a Minister of religion. When captured by the Duluth police (and later released) the police check his story and identity. They make a few phone calls and then believe he is legitimate - a real Minister of a Church. Since his identity was completely fabricated this is just impossible to believe. 3. Early in the story Lorne Malvo, who is a complete psychotic, kills the local police chief in Lester Nygaard's house and with Nygaard as a witness. But he does not kill Nygaard when Nygaard is still clearly a loose end. Contract killers like this character do not leave loose ends.4. We are expected to believe that Lorne Malvo, psycho hit man, can masquerade as a dentist (and is shown actually working on patients) for 6 months while plotting on getting at and executing a person in witness protection. This is just beyond belief.5. At the end of the story we are expected to believe that Nygaard would confront Malvo when he sees him in a Las Vegas hotel threatening to blow his cover in the presence of Malvo's girlfriend and work colleague whereas in reality he would have no reason to go anywhere near the guy. Of course we never see how a psycho hit man with zero friends can pull a hot looking young GF in the first place. Also quite unbelievable.6. Then when Malvo has his cover threatened we are expected to believe he would kill his girlfriend, colleague and the colleagues wife in the lift whilst not immediately killing Nygaard at the same time when he is 2 feet away in the same lift and there are no witnesses. In reality he would have disposed of Nygaard at the same time as the other 3 as there was every reason to and no reason not to. So then we are treated to days of Malvo taking the risk of being identified while tracking down Nygaard in his home town to trying and kill him when he could have done away with him in 2 seconds in the Las Vegas lift.I do not know why writers put scripts together with such obvious over the top flaws and expect it to look credible but that is Hollywood for you.Then finally we have to endure the beginning of each episode with the captions that this is a \"true story\" with the events happening exactly as depicted in Minnesota in 2006. Maybe some viewers will actually believe this nonsense when in truth the entire show is a work of complete fiction. Once again, the writers and producers are trying to treat the audience as idiots.Without its flawed script this show would be worth a 10/10 but as is it is only worth an 8.",

The humour is also the same and Bill Bob does an outstanding job as a villain. His dark humour and classic one liners are etched in time. Martin Freeman is as good if not better in this than the Sherlock series. I hold new respect as him for an actor since the Hobbit film series was terrible.Allison Tolman is a great actor, and comes across alluring and strong. All supporting actors are fantastic and classical comical, keeping to the same theme as the film. I have watched the first season three times and ready to put it back on again. Season 2 is also great, not the same theme as the Fargo film but still classic in its nature and references to the film and first season.",

Freeman has done better job than he did in \"sherlock\". I give him five stars out of five, for his role transformation in this series. The third main character of a female officer is quite depressing as she tends to brings down the tempo. I didn't like her..somebody else could have done it better. Then comes the sound track,its appropriate and doesn't kill the mood. All in all..

Shots could be heard from the bottom floor all the way up to the third...yet everyone he shot seemed taken by surprise. Which didn't ring true. Plus the two dimwitted FBI agents were sitting across the street, yet even they didn't show any real surprise until AFTER he finished slaughtering the top floor. That's nonsense. Everybody should have become alarmed when he started shooting up the first floor. This incident gave Thornton's character a sort of invincible-like, mystical status that's hard to swallow. He shouldn't have been able to escape even to two original hitmen earlier either, blasting away with their automatic weapons, but I chalked that one up to some sort of James Bond-like escapism. But the 22 deaths were a bit much. The real Malvo could not be walking around unaccosted as he was...out in the open with no one professional-like on his heels. Even with seemingly dimwitted Minnesota lawmen at the helm, a peace officer nemesis more on Malvo's level was needed to give this series more heft...although the pregnant woman deputy did give her best and should be saluted.

The story is told in such a clever way that there is no element left undeveloped or told in a banal way. The actors are superb and truly commit themselves in order to embody every contradiction, aspiration and responsibility for their action they hold. Patrick Wilson (\"Hard Candy\", \"Little Children\", \"The Conjuring\") is a revelation and, hopefully, his brilliant turn will give him the chance to star in more worthy projects. Kirsten Dunst (\"Melancholia\", \"Midnight Special\", \"Marie Antoinette\", \"The Virgin Suicides\", \"The Cat's Meow\") , in the most complex and dark role among the others, is once again able to display every bit of her character. Ted Danson, Jesse Plemons and Jean Smart play equally effectively their key roles. The rest of the cast is also outstanding. My vote is 8/10",

Feeling very disappointed... I'm on Episode 5 season 1, and finding it hard to push myself to finish the first season. Overall, I find it on the boring side, the stories are NOT funny to me (and I wonder if it's just funny to people from the Midwest? who get Midwestern humor? I don't know) But I'm finding the stories and humor and characters annoying. Officer Molly, supposedly one of the likable characters, is one of the most annoying to me. With no one to like or root for, this show is overall just extremely annoying, and I do not understand why people like it so much? (unless you identify with the Minnesota culture & humor and characters). I will keep watching but right now, I am not enjoying it! I'll give it a few more episodes.....",

With his stoical persona, he is to me a twins-representation of cerebral Mr. Spock (with haircut accordingly) meeting the almost indestructible Luc Besson's hit-man Leon.Best show on TV since Breaking Bad. A bit over-stylish at times since camera work and soundtrack are sometimes in the way of the narrative flow, but hey, we cannot complain about pushing the TV media to its limit which this show does superbly.

I hope that Colin Hanks will have a continuing role as this seems to be the perfect vehicle for him. This is some of FX's best. I'm finding that more intelligent TV is possible and this proves it. Billy Bob Thornton, in one scene, is showing his contempt for a thug who is threatening him in one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen on network TV. Although there is a lot of violence, somehow they make it all so funny! This is a show that is bound to get better and better with character development. I would love to see Billy Bob stay with the show but somehow I doubt he will. I can't imagine he would be satisfied with a weekly television series.

Malvo is an evil genius, and he's easily one of my favorite \"villains\" of all time. He's so manipulative and sneaky, I just love it. This show reminds me of a combination of Breaking Bad and Bates Motel. Lester's character reminds me of Walter White in a way, how he used to be so innocent and nobody treated him with respect, but as his character develops he becomes a bad ass. I just can't wait to see what Malvo does next! It's quickly become one of my new favorite TV shows. Billy Bob Thornton does an incredible job as Malvo, and I don't think anyone could play Malvo as good as he does. His character gives me the creeps in the best way. I really hope there is a second season, even though I know this is a mini- series, but it's so good and I'm not ready to give it up. My favorite episode of the season has to be episode 6 because it was so intense and I was shocked and in tears and it was an emotional roller coaster. Sure, this show can seem slow at times, but it's all build up for the intense, dramatic, and amazing scenes coming up (which is another similarity to Breaking Bad).

Martin Freeman was incredible playing the shy, done with life insurance salesman. And Billy Bob Thorton as one of the most interesting characters the Noah Hawley has created. The first season so good leading to the second, and I loved how it flowed with the movie. Maybe a few dull parts but I give it a 9.1/10. I'd say it was very underrated. As great as the first season was, it paled in comparison to the second. The second is a must see for everyone who watched TV. One of the best pieces of writing ever done. It is about a great story about feuds between a mafia, couple, and the police. It escalates every episode and the acting was incredible. There are a lot of familiar faces and seeing all of them at one of their best is great to see. It was really great how it went with the first season as well.

Martin Freeman did a fine job as Walter White Lite and the cinematography was good for television.The problem was in the details. Little plot holes keep popping up throughout that distract from the flow of the story. For instance, in the beginning, Freeman's character catches shrapnel in the hand, knocks himself unconscious and ends up in the hospital but no one notices the wound in his hand? What kind of hospital is this? Probably the biggest annoyance was the one year jump in time. Our heroine has managed to date, marry and get 8 or 9 months along into a pregnancy in one year. Possible but unlikely. Add to that, Mr. Nygaard has not only remarried himself but has somehow managed to not only start his own business but become so successful that he's named salesman of the year and upgraded his entire lifestyle. That's one hell of a business man. While all that is happening, Loren \"Evil Genius\" Malvo has somehow mastered dentistry, become a partner in a successful dentist operation and earned the complete trust of not only a blond bimbo but his erstwhile partner as well. That's one busy year! But the ending is the worst. Colin Hanks breaks into Malvo's cabin illegally, doesn't let anyone know he's there, and then (*spoilers*) murders Malvo without just cause. You might know he's guilty but you still have to be able to justify killing him!The storyline involving Oliver Platt is just non-sensical gibberish. It's supposed to tie back into the original movie but only sort of resolves itself. All of a sudden Malvo doesn't care what happens to the million dollars?! Or for that matter, Oliver Platt knows who he is!The show is watchable but full of plot holes. Better than anything CBS puts out but nowhere near HBO or A&E. One of those \"if nothing else is on\" type deals. Also, on a side note, the show relies WAY TOO MUCH on the \"oh you betcha\" gimmick. The state of Minnesota should sue for defamation.

Cinematographically the best of the seasons. Season 3 - 7/10:\nThe weakest of the three. Lacks slightly in execution and the cinematic enthusiasm of the predecessors. I missed more entanglements and connections with characters from the former seasons. V.M.Varga/David Thewlis is the highlight of this season and delivers my favorite performance of 2014. Emmit & Ray should have been shaped and performed slightly more diverse. Meemo didn't work for me. The female lead, Gloria Burgle, was a boring character. Episode 3 was very boring.

But I am very positive that new one will give good fight to the classic one.The casting is so superb that performance given by the cast looks very natural. The overall feel of the series is different as its set in winter and in snowy town of Minnesota and sometimes in North Dakota.The background score suits to tragic and sometimes comic nature of the situation.Currently I'm on the 8th Episode of the season and eagerly waiting on what gonna happen next. If you're still searching for good TV show after breaking bad , you can surely give a try for this one.",

With so many dead each week, it is of interest to see who survives until the end. The plot produced very predictable situations and Ed and Peggy were just too stupid to be believable. Mike and Hanzee, on the other hand, are intriguing characters, but Dodd is a dud. If you like violence for the sake of violence,you might give it a higher rating than I.",

            "content": "Fargo TV Series (2017 Season 3) Every episode of this acclaimed show, presented on FX, starts with the disclaimer, \"This is a true story. At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred.\" Well, that is nothing more than a teaser, made up by the producers. I've researched this as much as possible and every fact check I've read agrees that the show is not based on 100% true events. Not even close! In comparison with season one, which was fantastic and season two, which was even better, this year doesn't quite measure up. I still recommend it; it's a great adventure into the quirky world of Fargo, which requires all of your attention and concentration to every nuance of each script. The twists and turns almost require that notes be taken to sort out the multiple, over-lapping plots and the cast of characters. There will be no spoilers here; that would be sacrilegious and a disservice to the watchers. Currently, eight episodes have been shown on FX on Wednesdays at 10:00 PM EDT/9 CDT. You can dial up the first eight on demand and binge watch if you like; also available on-line. The cast is terrific, starring film actor Ewen McGregor, who plays dual roles of twin brothers. The wonderful Carrie Coon (HBO's \"The Leftovers\") will remind you of Frances McDormand who portrayed the police chief in the original film. Coon really shines. Mary Elizabeth Winstead (\"10 Cloverfield Lane\", \"Braindead\") is both alluring and gritty in her role as a small time grifter. David Thewlis, the British actor known for \"Anomalisa\" and the new \"Wonder Woman\" flick, plays the creepiest of scoundrels here. Michael Stuhlbarg (\"Boardwalk Empire, \"Trumbo\") is both funny and angst- ridden as the accountant, Sy Feltz. This series fulfills my need for the unusual, thought-provoking and intelligent TV in a sea of vomit that is broadcast television and the public's weird fascination with cartoon character big screen fare. My hope is that FX continues this series with a season four in 2018.",

It can be quite a roller coaster ride -- aggravating to the max, fun, funny, dark, grisly, sexy, erotic, violent, profound, philosophical, eccentric to the max . . . mostly never boring. It often has subtle messages, somewhat like a cautionary tale or a morality play . . . or commentary on how things are, vs. how they perhaps 'should' be. Many times it's not at all plausible. Many times it seems to be ripping off/imitating Q. Tarantino's films or quirkiness. It's a hoot *and* a holler! There are too many characters to individually comment on. As I said, the casting is first rate, as is much of everything else. It's hard to put down once you pick it up. I'm looking forward to Season 4.",

Season two has a UFO enough said. Season 3 kicks an ac out of a building and the cops don't care whatsoever just because Nikki says bad landlord.

Snowy Prairie without end and edges, cosy down jackets, dimensionless scarves, ginger ale at Home Caf\u00e9, a neat one-story houses, provincial naivety of local residents.

When I first heard about the series, I had no idea how they were going to fill 10 one hour episodes based on what originally seemed to be a very simple plot. I admit to being sceptical, but how wrong I was! From the first episode, the series adopts a sinister, dark undertone which is maintained throughout. This is chiefly done through the incredible Billy Bob Thornton. His role as Lorne Malvo is both terrifying and hilarious at the same time. The way that he sends a chill running down your spine while you are grinning is a feat that few actors have ever accomplished.Despite a rather dodgy accent that sometimes sounds Irish, Martin Freeman is also a wonder to watch. He plays the role of Lester Nygard brilliantly and his emotion and deterioration of his mental stability is portrayed perfectly. From the first episode, Freeman shows us that he is not Bilbo Baggins or Arthur Dent any more- he is a murderer and a liar. The moment he smashes his wife's head with a hammer a change is seen and it is fantastic.The brutality of the murders and the evil of Malvo is what makes this black comedy so sinister yet so very funny. The way that Thornton keeps a dead-pan face while slitting throats or stabbing people is perfect. Alison Tollman and Colin Hanks are also superb as the law enforcers with some brilliant lines and facial expressions. Overall the series' cast makes this drama an incredible viewing experience.Finally, witnessing such incredible effects and fake death astonishes throughout and really does make watching the series feel like you are watching a 10-hour movie.

But I got really disappointed, at the beginning (like episode 1-3), I thought it was kind of okay because the acting of Allison Tolman and Colin Hanks really surprised me positively. But also there I was really wondering how much of the show was inspired by Breaking Bad. Began with the clumsy and nervous Martin Freeman, who has really always bad luck. The phone call with Malvo (Billy Bob Thornton) was really shocking because the kind wording and spelling was like exactly the same like Walter White in Breaking Bad. And this character got even worse. Because he turns in barely one year from a clumsy looser salesman, into a head-bitten genius and suddenly (however this was possible in only 1 year) rich bad guy. This was really too much inspired by Breaking Bad and so it was no surprise that it failed. The other characters were okay but also just not really suspenseful. Malvo(Billy Bob Thornton) was even for me (and I really do not pay much attention on how realistic a movie is) too unrealistic. He can pull a men on his tie out of the office, while colleagues are watching and he got filmed by a camera. And what happens nothing, the police can not identify him just because he puts glasses on and babbles some bible phrases ? And nobody who saw him calls the police ? Like for example the guy from the mailing office who did not want give him the package ? And then he has even superpowers: He can shot down a whole gang of criminals, who were even watched by the FBI, without getting at least injured ? That was really to much and it did not give any additional value to the story... Next thing that really annoyed me was that really every women has to get pregnant ? What shall that show us ? That they do not use condoms in Bemidji ? That was really senseless and was a very very poor reference to the original movie. The final episode was the negative peak of the show. It adds plot holes and really not logical or rational decisions from nearly every available character: Lester(Martin Freeman)is a rich cold hearted super-genius, who can even shot the immortal Malvo. Malvo (Billy Bob Thornton) scraps all of his jobs just to kill Lester, but not in the elevator. No he waits until he is in Bemidji and the FBI hunts him. Otherwise it would not have been suspenseful. Then he even gets the phone number + codes from the FBI so he can stop them from coming to Bemidji just by calling then from HIS cell-phone. The two FBI guys are even more dumb then the police which is really a competition. And then Grimly(Colin Hanks) who seems to be the safest and most feared of all characters. Kills Malvo on his own (without knowing that he got injured), and he does not even got arrested for that. NO he gets a award for his self-justice... So all in all I can understand that some people like the show, because some dialogs are really funny and some characters are also kind of funny but especially in the end the story gets plot holes like a swiss cheese(so we call it in Germany ;-))",

But believe me when i say \"this is a must watch series\", this series has got MARTIN FREEMAN and BILLY BOB THORNTON, both of them are best actors and i went for it, i downloaded and i watched till the latest episode. This is one of the best series, because you will never know what's going to happen next and who will die. The episodes are constructed in such a way that the viewers must watch the next coming episodes. FREEMAN and BILLY BOB's portrayal of Lester and Malvo is exquisite. I say go for it guys.I think the 2nd or 3rd episode is little slow, but don't stop watching, because you might regret later.",

From the beginning the police was incompetent and those people who suppose to be leading others (chiefs) are just dumb and stupid and do not listen to their colleagues.

The actors did a great job in portraying the common psychological human traits without making it look dull or uninteresting. I would also say that it has many elements that had been shown in other great shows, and with a good outcome fortunately. The metamorphosis of character and black humor as in 'Breaking Bad', the conflict within police and the character's philosophical sense (though not very obvious) as in 'True Detective' the atmosphere of a tiny and kind of abandoned city which adds more and more to the element of mystery, just like in 'Twin Peaks', and finally the absurdity and morally weird acts and reacts of certain characters, just like in Quentin Tarantino's movies!P.S: This is my first review and English isn't my first language so this might not be very well expressed or arranged, but I hope you will get something out of it!",

I know things don't always turn out the way you want them, especially in the whiteout world of Fargo but having invested so much in this central plot I so wanted Molly to be the one to catch her man. After all, Gus gets Malvo and hey ho, redemption, but not poor Molly. Instead we have a very weak race through the snow in that ends inevitably for Lester with that sinking feeling.

To be honest I felt that Martin freeman was a little bit out of place, but he did an admirable job at the role considering. Billy Bob Thornton was amazing in every sense of the word and absolutely deserved that golden globe trophy. He is one of the best actors in Hollywood and he truly shows it every moment he's on screen, stealing the spotlight from everyone. Season one was just great. Season two, in my mind, was even better. Patrick Wilson is one of my favorite actors and I think he did a fabulous job as Lou. Ted Dansen was terrific as well. Kirsten Dunst did something that I had no idea that she could do and that's act. I loved her as the quirky and crazy Peggy. I also really liked Jesse Plemons. I think his performance was so criminally underrated and I'm not sure why he didn't get a golden globe nod. He played the role perfectly and he had that intimidation factor despite being seemingly clueless and good- natured, especially in the scene at the butcher. That scene compares to the countless other thrilling scenes such as the blizzard scene in season one as well as the motel scene later on in the season. I can't wait for season 3. 10/10",

Actually she is below than normal in some aspects. But she follows the trail to the criminal in her own way, slow and steady.Lots of people give claps to tBilly who acted murderer in show, but I really want to give an award to Allison(Molly).

Of course the location has the greatest effect on viewers, the white snow and the cold weather makes you so numb, it's almost painful.

The cast was super and being a miniseries it gave them more time to act and actually become the characters.

            "content": "Earlier this year when True Detectives came out, it was applauded universally for its content, storytelling and of course its direction. A big credit for its success was also given to its stellar cast which included Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey to name a few. The reason I am telling you this is - I think that show was over hyped and when I begin to compare it with Fargo my argument becomes more valid. Some might ask, how can you compare 2 completely different story- lines? Well, I agree the story and script are different but if we go a level higher, we begin to see thematic similarities between both the shows. They both contain elements such as dark humor, a deep dive down into the Human psychology and not to mention a strange aura associated with a small town/rural setting far from a cosmopolitan city. Having said that, Fargo scores more on all these aspects relative to TD. The performances are much more believable and on the spot. While TD sometimes becomes too reliant on its conversation b/w the 2 protagonists, the story is fairly straightforward. On the other hand, Fargo has a very tight story line with sharp and concise dialogs that don't dwell unnecessary into theological issues. Fargo's beauty lies in the fact that with an unfamiliar story which seems simple at first sight, its real character comes out during the amazing twists and a clever plot thrown in between. Martin Freeman is now an expert in playing 'reluctant' characters. He is already a reluctant Hobbit, a reluctant sidekick to a detective and now he becomes a reluctant criminal here. He has a terrific screen presence in spite of his small frame and I think the way his eye movement syncs with his dialogs, it's simply outstanding. Allison Tohman plays a dedicated policewoman, although not taken seriously by her own boss, is diligent in her work with a never say die attitude. Her character's honest and unwavering nature brings a righteous feel to the otherwise sinful drama. The Tour de force without any doubt is Billy Bob Thornton as evident by his nomination in Emmys and other major awards. He plays a drifter who is shown as the source of all evil, but I would rather consider him as a smooth operator with a devilish charm. He is a genius and psychopath at the same time and willing to do anything to achieve his objective. Tight script, excellent characterization and an unusual story commands 10/10 for this miniseries.",

You can see the hand of masters. By masters, I mean the Coen Brothers. They are special in the movie business and their works translate well to TV series.I Loved the acting of Billy Bob Thornton. His modest approach of his character made it something totally new. His Dialogues are brilliant, but his long hypothetical monologues are genius! Martin Freemand does what he does best. He is perfect for the role he's playing. You can feel the anger inside building up. Waiting for that fateful moment that he's losing control of the beast inside of him. I think that a lot of people will recognize his character.The only point of critique I have is the 'Hollywood Ending'. All the bad guys go down and the world is in balance again. That's a shame, because it doesn't add up with the realistic view through these series. It also cuts the road for a sequel.This series is a must see!",

            "content": "\"There are no saints in the animal kingdom. Only breakfast and dinner\" -Lorne Malvo I'm going to be completely honest. I only turned on the TV to watch 1x01 \"The Crocodile's dilemma\" because of Martin Freeman. He is my favourite actor right now, I knew he was gonna rock whatever part he played, and I was so excited to hear his American (Minnesotan) accent. While I am proud to announce that he didn't disappoint, he is not the only great thing this show has to offer by a LOOOOOOONG shot. Spoiler-free, the only thing I can say is that whoever checks into this show, from the first episode to the last, you are in for one HECK of a ride. A solid and well-thought out script. Realistically scary performances, especially when it came to Billy Bob Thornton as Lorne Malvo, a malevolent intimidating man who is both the God and the Devil in the figurative sense. Freeman as Lester Nygaard is one of life's victims, but slowly and surely he soon starts to figure out that there's another way to live life that doesn't include following the rules. Allison Tolman as the determined and kind Molly Solverston, the true heart of the show, and our real hero. In a story with so many shades of grey, it's nice to have a character that you can actually pinpoint and say \"Yup, Good Guy (girl).\" The show is mature in every sense of the word, but isn't afraid to let loose and show off it's comedic, childish or inappropriate side at times. I found the two sex scenes in the entire show to be a little bit much, but that's just me. Symbolism and Metaphors are everywhere, some that I'm still scratching my head about. This isn't just a show that you watch and forget about the next day, I don't think I'm going to forget this show for the rest of my LIFE. All I wanna do is watch the whole thing all over again, and I know that I'll have just as much fun going on the roller coaster as I did the first time! \"Because some roads you shouldn't go down. Because maps used to say \"There be dragons here.\" Now they don't. But that don't mean the dragons aren't there\" -Lorne Malvo.",

There are some other references and homages, like the one to the \"Big Lebowski\" (in S3) which is rather weak and superficial. The character of Mike Milligan (in S2) is also a poor and exaggerated imitation. There is some clever writing and appealing stylization in parts, but it's spoiled by a rather heavy hand in others. The \"true story\" angle is overdrawn and simply annoying, especially when a flying saucer immediately follows. Another great annoyance are the Jewish gangsters and the whole Jewish undercurrent. I get it, this was made by Jews, enough of this mishegas already. Not everything has to revolve around some recently mythologized ethnic identity, just as not all world events of all time have to revolve around the USofA, though try telling that to the Mormons. On the flip side, there is the brilliant parody of Reagan which has been done and overdone in the past but never with this degree of accuracy of bite. Very promising but too much stylization and pretense and not enough of that bite, suspense and for gods's sake, subtlety. A lot of it is cartoonish and not in a good way. What a shame.",

The show ran at a great pace and I thoroughly enjoyed every episode.

Hard decisions have been made and key players have fallen. The series has finally started tying this to earlier seasons through the characters' actions and words (the whipping with the belt and the basically word-for-word \"it's how you're unfriendly\" speech are just a couple of examples).I never thought that this season was \"bad,\" just a little too disconnected, however with what I've seen lately, I'm excited for what I hope will be a thrilling finish (will we meet a younger Floyd Gerhardt?).And if you still don't think this season is Fargoesque enough, you've come this far, you might as well finish it.",

I'm already dreading the wait before next season, but I know I'll make it somehow. At this point it's not quite as good as Breaking Bad got to be at the end, but I say Fargo is already better than the first few years of BB and has no where to go but up.

Now, What is amazing about this show is that all the movies like \"Rush\", \"Captain Philips\", \"We are Marshall's\" etc., have a TRUE STORY Inspiration which is moulded into excellent watch by some of the finest Talents in the movie industry. \"FARGO\" is the best of them in Television yet (True Stories Explained).Billy Bob Thornton is the best as Lorne Malvo. Excellent with his baleful influence with a cunning smile everywhere. And Martin Freeman is simply astonishing with the character of \"Lester Nygaard\" Oh he so lives up in the character that for a moment I had a doubt that 'is this the same fella as Dr. Watson from Sherlock ?' and to my amusement he is although he must have really worked hard to get that accent perfected.All the cast were put as they should have and the performance of each and everyone of them was astounding, even the 'Hess' Kids.The Story is so gripping that I watched it Non-Stop for Ten Straight Hours Jumping the Lunch as well on a Saturday morning.

With each season being self contained as a miniseries, the writers are able to create a gripping storyline which encompasses you as a viewer. Season 1 follows the journey of Lester Nygaard from an emasculated male to becoming a cold hearted killer. With the same wit and dark humour that the movie possessed, Fargo creates the aura of reality and a certain terrifying and chilling aspect, initially provoked by the initial warning before every episode. Perhaps the greatest aspect of Fargo, for which it has become synonymous with is its unexpected bursts of violence. These horrific acts give the feeling that no one is safe and has you legitimately fearing for the characters life, exceptional edge of your seat viewing. The writers of the show deserve great applause for their ability to explore and flesh out the flaws of each character and have you confused for which character you want to live or die.

Like there is nothing that make sense in it but in the worst way . Season 1 was all about the connections about the original movie :\nsome shots , character names and whatnot ,However the series didn't take the effort to make it logical instead of creating nonsensical plot twists in every episode . For example :\nS1. The character Lester decides to kill his wife after having a talk with Lorne Malvo , well for someone who is a coward most of his life i find it very odd that he is capable of doing that . But this is not the messed up part , the fact that Lorne Malvo trusted Lester and made friends with him almost immediately without anything to get back is . Like why would someone like Malvo ever cares about Lester that he goes to kill Sam Hess for free and gives his contact number to Lester killing an officer again for him without getting anything back from him ? The movie does do this , the salesman does hire kidnappers to his wife .Second of all , why malvo is killing all of these people ? Because he is just a philosopher believing that men must turn into wolves ? Well , is not because he works people up to scam them ?? You can't find a single motive for his character he is just there to create tension . He is poor resemblance of the mute character in the movie where he eventually got arrested but here Malvo was willing to lose his money just because Lester said yes to kill these people in the elevator .S2. Is way worse cause we see a stupid couple with UFO's to show up every now and then ,there is no genius to it at all . Ed and Piggy all of the sudden decided to be killers , lying to the cops and hiding a body. To realize at the end. That the couple don't really belong to each other after all , like seriously. How many dead bodies there need to be to have them realized that yeah is true that they both are idiots ? Its another cheap copy from Bonnie and Clyde but at Fargo as always change characters' faith so its poor adaptation .The cop always let people go if you noticed , he let the black guy and the two who pulled a gun at him go , he let hanze get away and he was so poor at doing his job because he couldn't catch lead or solve anything it was all just coincidence which makes his character unlike any crime drama a boring one . He didn't do any arrest to anybody even though people always pull a gun at him .and he didn't even get Ed and Piggy get arrested when he had the chance .Why Hanzee did what he did ? Because he wanted to build a gang himself or an empire . Well he needed his identity changed and of course alot of money so what is the best way to do that ? Is to kill everyone . He shot people in the street and a restaurant owner and who were the people behind them.it wasn't clear at the end .This show tries so hard to be smart and entertaining but fails pathetically to introduce a decent tv show . Overrated and cheap .",

The series brilliantly describes the train of events which follow their first meeting at a hospital.Not having seen the \"Fargo\", the 1996 movie , I didn't face any difficulty understanding the characters, their past, or the storyline in general. It is a standalone series and watching the movie is NOT a prerequisite. With the correct amount of humour, great characterisation, and outstanding performances by all the leads, the series can be counted amongst the best in its genre. However, this series would not be appreciated by all. With a tremendous amount of blood and violence, the series is ideal for dark comedy lovers, or lovers of the crime genre in general.

Superb dialogues, great cinematography, locations, clothing, all of which contributes to the overall image of the show. I have not seen anything like this before, the closest it matches to is True Detective but True Detective is rather more dark, grotesque and serious.

I was instantly hooked. I was intrigued. I was horrified.

Each episode is a 50 minute movie the progresses the plot. Even with 1 or 2 slower episodes, every episode is crucial for the finale. The character development is amazing. The acting and writing is spot on. The music works perfectly to keep you on your seat. Billy Bob Thornton just became one of my new favorite actors. FARGO keeps the drama and thrills to the very end. You don't watch FARGO, you are apart of it.If you are looking for a show that is deep, thought provoking, and thrilling, FARGO is the show. It will make you think about society and crime.

The 2nd series is thrilling, dark and incredibly funny at the same time.

I've never thought much of people in my office who rave about a television series. Now, I'm one of them. FX has it's biggest winner, in my opinion. What fascinates me even more is that it's based on a true story from 2006(?). Billy Bob Thornton reveals insight to everyday murder with some hard to deny reasoning and a wicked sense of humor. Martin Freeman's role reminds me the most of the original. He does a fine job. Allison Tollman didn't quite replicate the movie character, and that's OK. She didn't need to. She made it her own.

This show is technically amazing, story is unreal yet based on actually events with an unpredictable yet realistic characters.So why is this not a perfect 10? The reason is the following seasons. The first season is an 11 if possible. The characters are meaningful, interesting, and despite their choices the audience can't help but sympathise with them. However, in the 2nd and 3rd season, the characters fall some what flat as the audience does not have as much of an attachment to them. What causes this lack of attachment could be caused by a number of things, from total character development to simple editing timeline. If the seasons are to improve as the show continues, without any second thoughts this review will be updated to an instant 9 or 10.

More succinctly I find great similarities between Fargo Season 2 and Quentin Tarantino's Hateful 8. I would point to plagiarism on someone's part however the close proximity to which both were released make it more like a wild coincidence. Then again Partridge Brady. Munsters Adams. These things do happen fast. Rather than put you through the drudgery of reading my lengthy treatise, I will put down my thoughts in note form. Bokeem Woodbine's character is very much like Samuel L. Jackson's character in his preference for the full hairdo and the quoting of brainy ideas..usually right before an execution. I know Hateful 8 and Fargo season 2, so allow me to get back on track. Both Fargo Season 2 and Hateful 8 have colorful villains who are both comic strip like and terrifying. Both shows culminate in a bloodbath. Both have murders that take place, but then the scene cuts to the beginning where an unassuming, non-threatening voiced narrator attempts to give clarity or the mystery. The colored, ur... ah, African American gentleman in both features is an anti-hero who has definitive quirks that have allowed him to succeed despite being outnumbered and trifled with at every other turn for being a Colored, Ur..a... I mean... African American gentleman. Both feature a Sheriff who is an old school throw back to by the book law enforcement and modeling of proper behavior which makes their character beyond reproach. Lest not forget, the haunting yet mischievous sneakily running forward beat Soundtrack that netted Hateful an Oscar is heard in short order variation throughout the most pivotal scenes of Fargo Season 2.",

Yet I soon discovered that the best character in it--and the only female not a stripper or a hooker, or a housewife with no lines beyond nods or screeches--had been changed into a man. A perfect flawless man with a none-too-bright pregnant wife at home and a dingbat moron employee sidekick. Take out a brilliant woman and add 2 more stereotypes...did the Coen brother married to the star of the movie version get divorced and try to divorce the movie character as well? That was the inescapable feeling I got, and enough to make me shut off after the 2d moronic group of comments by the now-demoted female cop and the corrections to her flawed reasoning by her new boss, the now-male police chief. I wish the Coen Brothers were sentenced to read the book Backlash cover to cover for ruining a great movie's memory. I still have the DVD if I ever forgive them tho I'll never watch this tripe of a TV show. It's a shame people are still so unenlightened they buy into such stereotypes, judging by all the good reviews.",

The writing is atrocious, the plot lines twist and turn, going almost nowhere. I made it to episode 5 and could go no further, I only got that far as I had hope of something, something that would make it worth watching. There was nothing, had to take a shower just to wash the filth, ridiculousness and stupidity away.Such a wonderful cast, wasted with writing that may have come from some person in a psychiatric ward on so much medication that their brain is barely capable of functioning.

They add them whenever they want and wherever they want, and when they don't need those characters, they jut fade away. Many things happen that even if it was a true story, it's still hard to believe. The ending wasn't good too. Malvo was smart enough to recognize Lester from his wife.

Cinematography was top notch, for all seasons, screenplay and dialogue, character development were really setting the bar for the crime genre.The problem with making such a great season of a television series is being able to top that quality of execution the very next season. Season 1 set the bar, and Season 2 definitely met it. But Season 3... Hmm..I'm watching Season 3 now, and I cannot help but cringe at the casting. Specifically the fact that they cast David Thewlis as VM Varga. Thewlis is great when he's typecast in gritty roles like in Harry Potter. But Thewlis definitely SHOULD NOT have been cast for this role. V.M Varga is suppose to be intimidating, but Thewlis's portrayal is just so cringe. Every time he delivered a line of dialogue it just made me want to look away from the screen. It may be the fact that he had taken a 2 year break from acting before taking this role, but honestly I just believe he's just not suited. V.M Varga is suppose to come off as a smart, articulate and well spoken intimidating criminal in lower class clothing. But Thewlis's portrayal just come off as tacky and cringe. When his character first appeared on screen and delivered lines of dialogue I actually thought the entire time that he was playing a down syndrome character or something. Just wanted to punch his character in the fact every time I saw him.I know Jake Gyllenhaal isn't a television actor, but you guys should've cast someone like him instead. Jesus, I could do the casting way better than the season 3 casting director. Give me the job!",

            "content": "With season 4 coming out in a month and the pandemic I finally got around to watching this. I've been a really big Coen brothers fan for a while which I think caused a few problems for me in this show especially in season 1. I'm going to write short reviews for each season due to how different each one is.Season 1 was great but was definitely my least favorite season without much competition. It makes the most sense when you hear about a show based on the movie Fargo because it tries very hard to be as much like the movie as possible which caused it to come off less original and it didn't have much of it's own personality to me. Billy Bob Thornton was an incredible villain, Martin Freeman gave one of his best performances and the first episode is one of my favorites.Season 2 was a step up for me and improved on almost every issue I had with the first season. The season being set in 1979 gave the settings and technology a lot of personality which is also why I'm excited for season 4 being in the 50's. The editing and directing was way more stylized than season one and gave it a unique feeling. A big reason I loved the season so much was every character and storyline was captivating and I was always deep into what was happening. There were choices made that felt like a Coen brothers idea but the Coen brothers never did it.Season 3 seems to be divisive among fans with most seeing it as the worst but for me it was tied with season 2 as my favorite. The reason I can't choose between the two seasons is they're so different. Season 2 is fun, has a lot of action, and has a lot of different characters and plots. Season 3 is very strange comparatively it's a lot more dismal, has a lot more scenes of just dialogue, and has fewer characters. This season left a bigger impression on me in the way that it was more psychological and had more meaning to it. This season probably has my favorite final episode in the show too. David Thewlis as V.M. Varga was probably my favorite performance from him and my favorite character in all of the series.This show started the same year as True Detective another crime anthology show which started off to bigger critical acclaim with an incredible first season but due to a disappointing second season it caused a drop in viewership with the third and people not being able to call the show itself great but just the first season. This is where Fargo prevails as it is an anthology show that improves each season or at least in my opinion is consistently great. This to me is the perfect example of how good anthology tv can be. This is definitely one of the best tv shows currently running and I have very good faith that season 4 will be incredible too.",

From the first episode, the show explores the characters of Lester and Lorne Malvo. Lester being the submissive salesman, and Lorne Malvo, the dominating drifter who likes to mess with people, sometimes for his own amusement. The show is witty, with many thoughtful anecdotes and not moody and has all of the subtle dark comedy that the Coen Brothers are known for. The pilot was in my opinion the best pilot to have aired since Lost. The deaths were unpredictable, and the show never felt that it was dragging itself over. I felt the ending provided a good closure for the show, and despite having many connections managed to weave them together by the finale. Overall, the show was brilliant, and one of the best shows of last year.",

            "review_title": "Fargo Season 2: DOA",
            "content": "SPOILER ALERT* Just a little. Why DOA you ask? A show about murder (or any television show for that matter) has to start off with a bang. Either literally or figuratively. S2:E1 of Fargo starts off with a barrage of information- of which only a few facts can be gleaned (sorry I don't speak Minnesotan)- family business, deals being made, brothers in hierarchy (natural tension) and finally, the patriarch dying. (All in two minutes) While this does set the scene for the rest of the season, do I care? No. The action happened so fast, it was comedic (and not in a good, dark Coen bros way.) Cold murder in otherwise unsuspecting places? Classic \"Fargo.\" Dark humor? Classic Coen Brothers. While the first ep tries to stay true to that vein, the believability falls flat. Specifically, in the scene where a cherub Kristen Dunst (playing Peggy Blomquist- great name, invoking mundaneness) hides a man she hit by her car, and then pleads with her husband not to investigate, one wonders, wouldn't she be scared of a man bumping around her garage? When he does investigate and ends up killing the man, he goes for the man's gut and stabs him with a garden tool. Why wouldn't he just knock him out? And if you're thinking, \"shit happens,\" then why wouldn't he be in shock? While I am a Jesse Plemons fan (Breaking Bad), he was just delivering his lines. His character, Ed Blomquist, merely concerns himself with his wife, Peggy. Not believable. Writing: Let's look at the writer to get to the bottom of this. Noah Hawley: Wrote all ten episode of Season 1. So what's the problem, then? (Can you tell I enjoyed Season 1?) Is there a room full of ghost writers? If so I suggest Hawley comes back to work. Directing: While I hate to attack the director, (I am one) I can see no other source of why it's bad. Michael Uppendahl and Randall Einhorn co-directed. Makes sense for Uppendahl- he directed American Horror Story (very campy) and Glee (definition of Camp). He did direct Mad Men though, and will I have heard good things, I haven't seen it. Einhorn on the other hand, has directed primarily comedies (Nurse Jackie, The Office, Wilfred, It's Always Sunny). Cinematography: Good. Visually beautiful, compositionally and in color and light. Yet, if the story is lacking, what is cinematography going to do? Sure, I can have this on mute and have it running for a dinner party for conversation starter, the equivalent of a coffee table book. Shots that pose problems: The split screen- technically used to show the viewer two pieces of information at once, it can be utilized to do amazing things for story and perception, considering this technique interrupts the eye's natural \"stream of reality\" with one screen. (Read a great list of top ten uses of split-screen in films.) Instead this episode shows Peggy Blomquist doing her makeup nervously, as a flashback, in contemplation for what she has done. The problem? It's boring. The shot where we see Kieran Culkin (Yes, his brother) playing Rye Gerhardt from a window outside the diner, nice, compositionally. Does it further the story? Does the fact that he appears in the last window, suggest he is a tad askew in personality, suggesting that it makes sense he just shot three people when he didn't need to? Could be. Shot to watch for in ep1: The slow motion sequence of the kitchen diner door swinging, while Gerhardt kills two people in seemingly one second, is beautiful. It exemplifies violence and how quick a situation can turn sour. Final Verdict: If you came for the stars, stay. (I might stay for Jean Smart- she barely got any lines this ep, and was hilarious in Designing Women) If you came for the story, hope that it well get better. If you value your time, leave, at least until someone else blogs that it did get better.",

All the cast from Martin Freeman to Patrick Wilson knocks it out of the park. For those who don't know Fargo is an American Black Comedy Drama Series on the Network Series Fx. Let me get right to it and say that. The writing is so funny and quirky, its a very dark comedy drama that just doesn't let you off the edge of your seat. This is my first review for a TV show or movie ever and i feel that Fargo really deserves a 10/10, if you've never seen this show i would highly recommend it. The Directing is very coen brothers style, it really gives you that western type feel. Nothing that i have seen throughout my days of binge watching has kept me engaged in the story and the characters as much as Fargo has.While Shows like Breaking Bad and Lost have those amazing characters and story, it doesn't feel like its setting itself is a character like Fargo, you feel that everything is connected and theirs a bigger message its showing you.

I liked this series even better than the film (with France McDormand) that told the same story a few years back. The season-long format allowed deeper character development and more room for pure style.Each episode of Fargo begins with a message on the screen, saying the story is true and that actual events unfolded just as they are shown.

            "content": "Billy Bob Thornton was exactly what this show needed. I saw the movie but it didn't captivate me like this mini-series did. The writer combined with the actors/actresses were perfectly matched. There is no way I could miss a single week. I didn't want to miss an episode because every single one was intriguing. What was going to happen next? Who was Malvo going to get rid of next? He seemed to elude authorities constantly and it seemed impossible for them to locate him although he was in plain sight. The character of Lester was hilarious yet sneaky. How could there be very little suspicion cast upon him especially when his 2nd wife was murdered! I can't imagine what other true thrilling stories this writer can come up with to share with the world, but I hope the powers that be will allow it. I never viewed the movie with as much enthusiasm as I did this TV series. Please give us a 2nd season!!",
