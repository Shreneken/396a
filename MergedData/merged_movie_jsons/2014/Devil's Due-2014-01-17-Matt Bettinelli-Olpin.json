            "content": "The orphan Samantha (Allison Miller) gets married with Zach McCall (Zach Gilford) and they travel in honeymoon to Santo Domingo. In their last night in the Dominican Republic, the newlywed couple is invited by a taxi driver to go to a party in the outskirts of Santo Domingo. They drink too much and do not see that Sam is brought to a weird cult. They return to the United States and soon Sam discovers that she is pregnant. Along the pregnancy, Sam changes her behavior and becomes nervous and aggressive. On the night of the delivery, Zach witnesses weird events at home. \"Devil's Due\" is a lame and cheap movie that uses the same storyline of \"Rosemary's Baby\". This rip-off could have the title \"How to Destroy the Storyline of a Masterpiece with a Hand-held Camera and an Absurd Plot\". Sam and Zach accepting to go to a slum in an unknown country with a stranger are among the greatest stupidities of the cinema industry. The new doctor uses the office of Dr. J. Ludka and no receptionist or nurse notices. The house of Sam and Zach is completely destroyed in a calm neighborhood and no neighbor observes. The use of camera as if it were Zach is nonsense in most of the situations. My vote is two.Title (Brazil): \"O Herdeiro do Diabo\" (\"Devil's Due\")",

            "content": "Samantha and Zach get married. For their honeymoon, they went to visit the Dominican Republic. One night there, they were brought by their taxi driver to a mysterious place where they get drunk and drugged. Nevertheless, they still managed to get back home safe and sound. Not long after, Samantha finds out she was with child. From there, the further along the pregnancy Samantha got, the more bizarre and more violent behavior she would display. As she nears her due date, can Zach still do anything to avert the diabolical fate that seems to await his wife and baby?Like many current horror films, \"Devil's Due\" is told through camera footage. Aside from the cameras Zach and characters carried around, there was also footage from security cameras. The first thirty minutes were practically just needless wedding coverage. When it got around to telling the story, the pace was also quite slow. Mundane daily events like going to the supermarket or the obstetrician were punctuated by some disgusting or violent scenes which would have been a big deal had it happened in real life. Here, they happened, but there seemed to have been no consequences that follow their occurrence.The best moments of this film were those scenes showing Samantha's repulsive eating habits, her super-telekinetic powers, and her effect on Catholic priests. The rest of the film was unfortunately forgettable, all the way up to the predictable climax. 3/10.",

            "review_title": "Hand-held horror fare without pretensions.",
            "content": "\"Devil's Due\" follows a young newlywed couple who find out they're expecting a child after returning home from their honeymoon in the Dominican Republic. Shortly into the pregnancy, mother-to-be Allison begins having unusual symptoms, and it appears that she and her husband are being watched by some sort of secret society who are awaiting the birth of one of the \"many\" antichrists.Cleverly prefaced with scripture from John, \"Devil's Due\" sets out on a road oft-followed in the found footage sub genre of horror films, charting terrorized couples and Satanic magic wreaking havoc on suburbia. That said, the film has a few interesting aspects; first off, it's not really a \"found footage\" film. Although much of the narrative is dispensed through home video footage which is recorded by the couple themselves, the film also utilizes surveillance footage from public spaces as well as the cameras secretly placed in their home to help tell the story. In other words, it is not a film claiming to be a \"true story\" \"discovered\" as a cohesive piece of found footage. It's in all actuality a fairly standard horror movie that is told through the medium of hand-held video and surveillance without the claims of being real or \"found\", and for that, I found the film mildly refreshing. I roll my eyes every time I see a found footage horror film claiming to be reality (\"The Devil Inside\" comes to mind), but \"Devil's Due\" makes no bones about anything of the sort, and in that sense is very much aware of itself and doesn't rest solely on its pretensions.Secondly, I can't not praise the acting in this film. The other downfall of most \"found footage\" films is that they star unknown actors who often have little experience and/or talent, and thus tend to have less-than-stellar acting, which just cheapens films that are already cheap to begin with. That's not the case with \"Devil's Due\". Zach Gilford plays the concerned husband role both behind and in front of the camera, and is convincing in the role; however, Allison Miller is the one who really carries the film. Her performance in this was wonderful in general, and especially wonderful in a film of this type. Very naturalistic and totally believable. My praise even goes for the minor roles; all of the acting in the film does feel genuine, which really elevates this above other hand-held horror fare.Narratively, the film is definitely imperfect. Some people have claimed the film is boring, which, while it does take time to get going, the slow burn nature of it allows for some subtle scares to creep in over an extended period (also, there isn't much for jump scares here either, which I was really surprised by). That said, the film does lack steam at times, and propels itself into a conclusion that doesn't reveal as much excitement or surprise as the preceding 80 minutes would lead you to believe is coming. The finale is pretty weak, and follows a pattern that's been done before in other found footage genre films. That's not to say that a horror film requires a twist ending to be worthy (which this film surprisingly doesn't have), but there's not a whole lot of payoff in terms of anything truly shocking or nuanced occurring in the film's final act, and for that, it is predictable. There's a lot of build-up for a pretty mediocre ending.All things considered, \"Devil's Due\" is an oddball in the sub genre in which it's been placed. The film doesn't make any claims to reality, doesn't ascribe to jump scares or a surprise ending, has shockingly worthwhile performances, and, most importantly, isn't actually a \"found footage\" movie at all. The references to \"Paranormal Activity\" and \"Rosemary's Baby\" are indubitable, and despite the film's burnout ending, I still was mildly happy with it, probably because it did the opposite of what I expected it to do in a lot of ways. The flip side of that is that the film doesn't have much in way of surprises, but the above-average performances and a handful of crafty scenes elevated it above any other hand-held and/or found footage horror film to come out in the past five years. 6/10.",

            "content": "'DEVIL'S DUE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Another low-budget supernatural horror 'found footage' flick. The story is about a recently wed woman who unexpectedly becomes pregnant, with the Antichrist. It's an homage to the classic Roman Polanski thriller 'ROSEMARY'S BABY' but it's presented in a style that's a lot more similar to the 'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY' franchise. It was written by Lindsay Devlin (who's only other film writing credit is the 2013 documentary 'IN SO MANY WORDS') and directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett. Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett are part of a collective filmmakers group called 'Radio Silence'; they previously co-directed, co-wrote and co-starred in a segment of the 2012 'found footage' horror anthology 'V/H/S'. I think the filmmaking duo did an exceptional job on this (their debut feature film) and found it to be much better than a lot of critics (and 'found footage' movie haters) have made it out to be.The story revolves around a newly wed couple, named Samantha and Zach McCall (played by Allison Miller and Zach Gilford), that go on their honeymoon in the Dominican Republic. After Samantha gets a weird reading from a fortune teller the two are led to a remote bar (outside the city) by a persistent cab driver (Roger Payano). They both get wasted (on shots) and pass out. It then appears that Samantha is taken to a room, beneath the club, where some kind of ritual is performed on her. When they return home they find out she's pregnant, despite the fact that Samantha has always regularly taken her birth control pills. The two decide to keep the child and then things really get strange. It's of course all caught on video and compiled (from many different sources) for the viewer.The film (like I said) got mostly bad reviews from critics and horror fans (that hate the 'found footage' genre). It did get a few good reviews (though) from some scary movie aficionados (like director Eli Roth and the popular horror website 'Bloody Disgusting'). I enjoyed the movie; I love the horror genre and like 'found footage' flicks, when they're done right. I think this one was done right; it's scary, funny and just a lot of fun to watch. The rookie directors did a great job and the script is smart and clever as well. The two leads were also adequate enough (for a film like this); the lead woman is very beautiful too and the lead guy reminds me a lot of a political radio and internet talk show host (I watch) named David Pakman. It's just an all around good fright flick, especially if you like the genre. Ignore the haters!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKhLjf_1MKw",

What works is the actors and director comes across as real life. I like how the characters' behaviour is detailed with little quirks. Devil's Due's strongest asset is the story's linear progression of events slowly getting worse. As usual the story's protagonist pieces together the bizarre event too little to late. Devil's due is another homage similar to Blair Witch and the Paranormal series. The originality of the camera telling the story genre is getting old. Still a watchable movie. I give Devil's Due a six or seven out of ten. Depending if you like horror movies. Does everyone always have to expire in these films?",

The priest snapping suddenly in the hospital! The teens in the woods getting killed off by Sam whose eating animals insides! The cam SD card (containing the footage of Sam in the ritual) going missing!The film it'self was dark & creepy! The man staring up at the house was creepy! Though the story-line didn't make sense in a way, though I didn't focus on that so much! It was bloody at the end! Had some gory moments! Bleeding noses etc! The part where Sam cuts into the womb! Ouch! The ending was sad as Sam dies & this creepy old man & creepy black taxi driver take the baby away! Then him being questioned by officers! Then the ending where the creepy black taxi driver goes after another couple! Slightly typical ending! Overall I'd say a 8.5/10 for this one! A decent horror film!",

            "content": "Oh the irony. I am a true horror fan from way back. I love it all except for the rage of \"found footage\" \"hand cam\" horror. The Blair Witch Project was brilliant and since then film makers have been beating this style of film to death and beyond. I am sick of it quite frankly. I won't even go out of my way to watch one and usually when I find out a horror flick is \"found footage\" it gets shut off. But I wanted to see this one through. The irony is how poorly this is scored on IMDb. I thought this was world's better than the awful Paranormal Activity: Marked Ones and the truly unfortunate thing is if they had bothered to make this just a regular old horror film it could have been terrifying and thrilling and a possible ten because the performances in the movie border on excellent believe it or not. The story is stale...I will agree with many others. We have seen this story done again and again and again (thank you Rosemary's Baby and The Omen.) However, for being same old it is well written and follows the necessary predictable recipe. It actually got to the point where I was literally saying out loud what was going to happen next. This sounds like ear mark of a terrible movie but it wasn't terrible. I wanted to know where the story was going, what was going to happen with this young, formerly happy couple and I did feel some heart palpitations with some scenes so bravo to them for that. I am certain if you switch the lights out and sit back you'll be at least a little scared.Part of the reason I think the film was so much better than it should have been was our lead cast and couple. Allison Miller is excellent as Samantha, the mother to be. We are introduced to her the night before her wedding so by the time the changes take effect we sort of see how different she is. She seems like such a happy and normal woman who you can relate to. She plays it very down to earth making her transformation terrifying and she really does a great job. Its a shame she's wasted on an uber-generic found footage horror. Not to be outdone in any way Zach Gilford is also very good as her doting husband. Gilford gets less scenes in front of the camera because he is often behind it filming (how irritatingly stupid.) He also does a terrific job and his intensity in the later scenes really holds the film together. The two of them have truly outstanding chemistry and it really gives this film a lot of credibility to have them in it. There isn't a big supporting cast and no one stands out amongst them but I will mention I love character actor Sam Anderson who has a small and very creepy role as Father Thomas.Honestly, they could have made this one of the best horror films of 2014 if they just filmed it like your every day movie. Every scene I kept thinking this would be so much better, more terrifying and just more fun to watch if it weren't through the supposed eyes of a home movie camera. It shouldn't surprise me though that the directors behind this were also the people responsible for V/H/S a movie I gave a total of ten minutes too before I shut it off. This is superior to V/H/S but they also got a much bigger budget. The only other glaring issue with Devil's Due is it goes on too long. It is the average movie length but you begin to feel like the same thing is happening over and over again. Even during the climatic scenes when all hell breaks loose (pun fully intended) it seems to just keep going when it should get to the point. Still the ending is not disappointing and I found myself wide eyed more than once. Finally when the baby is born...well it's all kinds of messed up and the scene is more than disturbing. Devil's Due is different from something like Paranormal Activity because I don't think they're trying to make you feel like its real. There are some pretty outrageous scenes of telekinetic ability and devil possession that would have best suited a regular horror film (I'm never going to let it go.) Still if you are a fan of the found footage genre...first of all...I'm sorry that you are but this one is of a much better quality than the other junk out there. You could do far worse and while I would never watch it again I enjoyed my first viewing. 6.5/10",

            "content": "First of all, I am a big fan of the found footage supernatural/horror genre and love watching even the lesser acclaimed films. I am the type of viewer that draws the positives out of a very flawed film and enjoy it. So I expected to enjoy something out of this at the very least. My god, what a tediously insufferable film this turned out to be.There is absolutely no innovation or any attempt to try something new. It is so painfully boring.The concept idea was very promising which is basically a found footage rendition of The Omen or Rosemary's baby. However, this film is so dire at engaging the audience due to the most irritable protagonist I have ever seen so far in a found footage type movie. For more than half of the movie, we are tortured with the sickly saccharine antics of a doting husband on his newly wed wife. There is no natural humour to ease the torment and worse for a film of this type, there were actually no scares until the last act.As I said, I am the type of film goer that draws the positives and try enjoy that. So are there any? Well, there is a dog that was amusing for 2 seconds but even he looked bored, thereafter. OK, there is a bit more positives. You do get a predictable climax in an attempt to \"reward \" us for our eternal patience which was efficiently executed but without any unique vision or flair, just the usual creep around corridors and...\"boo\" oh it was just the dog sort of thing. The actors do perform well but the material they have to work with is revolting.At the end of the credits there is a piece of text explaining that this film created 200,000 jobs. Well that was nice to know and the only bit that made me feel good knowing that at least it gave a lot of people work but then I wonder if stating that was an indirect apology and their justification to make this dreadfully boring movie?TO be fair, the film is as polished as it can be for a found footage genre but its all pointless if it fails to engage us in the narrative. If you haven't seen many horror films or supernatural films such as Paranormal Activity etc, then perhaps you might enjoy this more as long as you can stomach the vomit inducing newly weds for half of the movie. I give this a 3/10 rating, mostly for the dog that looked fairly convincing in not wanting to be in the movie. Get a new agent doggy, you deserve better.",

No doubt there'll be a sequel, and another, and another. Remember when there were actually good horror found-footage films? Me neither. Hollywood is just saturated with them, none of them good.

The movie is filmed entirely in first person similar to the Blair Witch Project but more like Cloverfield --- but unfortunately the point of view changes which makes it kind of confusing. It starts as a newlywed couple vacation on their honeymoon in the Dominican Republic. Nothing is really revealed abnormal about the couple except that the wife is a foster child with a supposed past hard life. They are having a typical good time, but then decide to take a detour to an underground party after being coaxed by a local taxi driver. After they get a little too toasted we see a brief glimpse of some footage at a strange religious ceremony, but then are taken back to footage of them arriving from their vacation back into their new home. We find out later that ceremony has much to do about what happens next. The wife becomes pregnant despite being on the pill, and immediately starts suspecting that there are problems with the baby. She then starts doing strange things like eating raw meat at a grocery store(despite being a vegetarian), causing preachers to cough up blood, and taking night walks into the wild to kill deer and munch of their innards\u0085so naturally the husband starts questioning something awry is going on\u0085.you think?? The movie is scary at times but because it is so predictable you just wait for the eerie things to happen(and they do). There is eventually a story told here that makes some sense as to why things happened but there are a lot of holes to it as well. I will leave out a lot of the specifics just in case you want to watch this movie about an antichrist possession\u0085.i'm not sure why I wanted to watch it myself\u0085I think I was just challenging myself\u0085but overall this is just not that great of a movie, and the creepy feeling only lasted for a short while after the movie was over.",

I'm not sure how this film got made as its just so bad. No body in this cinema jumped even once, and this is the type of film you should jump at.The effects at the end were cool but literally you could walk into this film about 45 minutes through and you wouldn't have missed anything. The plot wasn't explained very well either which was a big let down as I though the idea for the film was good.The \"enemy\" in this film weren't really explained either, nobody new who they were or why they did it they just thought we would assume they are in some form of cult. The characters were lame to be honest and weren't likable in the slightest.

There were a few massive issues! firstly as you watch them in the car at the start of the movie they have there camera pointed at a guy on the bike, as they pass the camera scrolls to the wing mirror and the dudes disappeared! he was there and poof had gone, clearly poor editing.Next! the woman carved stuff into the floor and the man who worked a lot in that room building furniture at no point noticed! even though it was a room he did work in! secondly with this point is that she carved wood...so sawdust! I find it laughable that this stuff gets cleaned up whilst someone is in a demonic state! surely the sawdust would be there the next day? it wasn't! she is a very tidy demon..Last massive flaw! she ate 2 alive deer's! and showed super powers, that was the only time she did cool things and even then there was no follow up! surely someone would say on the news crazy woman eats dear or in the other scene at the market she opened and ate raw mince meat! but no! overlooked again.This film is terrible, i'm a fan of the genre but please god stop throwing hundreds of these films out and focus on making a few good ones.AVOID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

The first 20 minutes feels like someone forcing you to watch their bad home movies. It never really gets much more exciting then that.

            "content": "Promoted as ROSEMARY'S BABY meets PARANORMAL ACTIVITY, this low-budget found footage movie was first caught the attention of famed director Eli Roth (HOSTEL, HOSTEL: PART II) at which he quoted on his official Twitter account: Don't pre-judge Devil's Due because Rosemary's Baby is a holy grail movie. It's so smart, creative, inventive, and fun. Very very scary. Upon finally watching it, I was like: Is he for real?WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?DEVIL'S DUE revolves around a newlywed young couple, Zach McCall (Zach Gilford) and Samantha McCall (Allison Miller) who both experience a mysterious lost night during their honeymoon vacation at Santo Domingo. Upon returning home, Samantha finds out that she is unexpectedly pregnant. Though shocked, the couple is happy with the result. Soon, as Zach starts to record everything with his video camera, he begins to notice a series of odd behaviors in his wife. As months goes by, it becomes obvious that there is something bad going on within Samantha's pregnancy.THE GOOD STUFFDEVIL'S DUE begins promisingly with a sneaky opening scene involving a \"stalker\" prowling at Samantha's house. It's nevertheless a good cinematic tease that both directing duo Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett (V/H/S) has displayed here. Apart from that, the two primary actors -- Zach Gilford and Allison Miller -- are worthwhile as well. However...THE BAD STUFF... Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett botches the would-be intriguing premise with their pedestrian direction. Aside from the middle scene involving Samantha and the three teenagers at the woods, most of the spooky parts are surprisingly low on scare. If that's not insulting enough, the so-called payoff at the finale is a huge disappointment -- all strangely anti-climactic and yet so unfulfilled that you might end up shouting in your mind: Seriously?Added to the disappointment is Lindsay Devlin's uninspired screenplay. It's nothing more than your typical found footage and supernatural horror combo that you've seen many times before.FINAL WORDSAll I can say that DEVIL'S DUE is a total rip-off from the immortal classic, ROSEMARY'S BABY. Save your hard-earned money, and wait for DVD release instead.http://www.caseymoviemania.blogspot.com",

They pull up at the venue, where the possibility of a party seems far-fetched and even the faintest sound of music is undetectable. When Samantha gets nervous and decides to change her mind we feel a sense of fear and anticipation for what might happen. The storyline alludes to the possibility that the driver has other intentions, however tucked away in the most unlikeliest venue is a live and vibrant rave. The couple relax and party the night away, however, the plot thickens.When the Samantha and Zach get so drunk that they lose track of their belongings, the camera cuts away to reveal clips of muffled voices, a religious cult and what seems to be Samantha on a sacrificial altar.The next morning they both wake up in their hotel room, with a hangover which they put down to their wild night out.They suspect no foul play. Shortly after returning home, despite being on the pill, Samantha announces that she is pregnant. We begin to watch her becoming increasingly hostile and strange things begin to happen.I watched this movie with no expectations and I was pleasantly surprised. Zach Mcall journals their life using a homemade video camera, the majority of the film is shot from the first person. The movie looks low budget, as though executed by amateur producers, which is the point. Only after, did I discover that the movie actually had a $7,000,000 budget, and was produced by Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation. The natural, unforced acting, was so realistic and effective that it will make you question every reality television show that you have ever watched.Devils Due is a peek at what a horror should be. It was atmospheric without the need to jump us. Frightening without cheap scares. Spooky, without the use of excessive sound effects. It was well paced with a flawless storyline. The movie was unhurried and builds a rapport between the viewer and the characters. We get to meet their inner social circle and we learn about the characters background. This window seat glimpse into Samantha and Zach's life allows us to feel a connection with both characters and we are won over by Zach's charm and Samantha's innocence. We are drawn in by the subsequent changes in Samantha's personality. This is why the film works so well because we witness the nightmarish languish of this sweet and loved up couple.Many people will argue that the storyline was not original and whilst I agree there were many parallels between The Last Exorcism, The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity, by taking what was lacking in similar movies, Devils Due has put its own unique stamp on this reality horror genre.I was only slightly disappointed by the ending as there was a lot of build up for a pretty predictable ending, but overall I was still impressed. This film does not feel the need to rely on gore and sound effects to win the audience over, just good old-fashioned creativity. All in all Devils Due was kept me on edge the whole way through and is well worth a watch.",

That is the only positive in the whole movie. The movie is very clich\u00e9 and has no originality to it. I have no idea why someone would fund the making of this movie, due to the fact that the script was probably written in 10 minutes.The film overall was boring, and some scenes were just embarrassing to watch, such as the scene in the forest and the scene (which you probably seen in the trailer) where there is a large movement in Sam's stomach. I have seen a lot of comparisons to Paranormal Activity, which are known for building the atmosphere for a climatic ending, Devil's Due fails at this as the ending feels rushed and is over very quickly. (SPOILER ALERT) It then closes to a couple in France, who are then picked up by the same cab driver who took Sam and Zach to the party which leads to the ritual. I have no idea who he is, or who any of the other people on his side are. This means we learn nothing about why they do what they do. (SPOILER END)This film is up there as one of the worst films I have ever seen; it is unoriginal and not scary in the slightest.

Meanwhile, Zach investigates a reoccurring symbol on his camcorder that  turns out to imply the antichrist.  The pictogram also has something to do with the strangers who have been  watching their home.  Yet another found-footage movie about demonic possession, Devil's Due  brings nothing new to the fatigued genre.  Neither clever nor scary in its delivery, this film is a stillbirth.  Besides, Sam isn't the first woman to return from her honeymoon  impregnated with another man's baby.   Red Light",

            "content": "What happens when you take all the scares, intrigue and great acting you saw in \"Rosemary's Baby\" and make it a poorly edited \"found footage\" film? You get \"Devil's Due.\" While the \"found footage\" subgenre is packed with hidden potential that has, on rare occasion, breathed new life in the formulaic world of horror, a lot of them tend to rely too heavily on the tired tropes that have been created for this(relatively) young horror category. \"Devil's Due\" is blatantly obvious with its flat-out refusal to try anything new. Sure, it decides to forgo the usual act of hiring unknown, unproven actors in order to sell some sort of realism that died after \"The Blair Witch Project\" decided to do a sequel but they replace them with somewhat recognizable people who just can't pull off the one-dimensional and flat characters the script offers up. Add that with some really poor editing and a plot that basically claims it wants to be an homage to one of the greatest horror movies of all time but rests with a story that contains more filler nonsense than your usual \"found footage\" film and not a single scare in sight, what you are left with is a film that is barely watchable and complete uninteresting. This fact is even sadder when you realize that it took two men to direct this film and THIS was the best they could do.Hey there!

Basically, filmed on many hand-held cameras, young couple Zach (Zach Gilford) and Samantha 'Sam' McCall (Allison Miller) have got married and are going on honeymoon to the Dominican Republic, while there they visit fortune teller who repeats to Sam, \"they've been waiting for you\". Later that night they get lost trying to find their way back to their hotel, they are picked up by a pushy cab driver (Roger Payano) who offers to take them to a local bar, they reluctantly accept, there they party and both pass out drunk, they appear to be taken to an underground chamber where Sam is subject to some kind of cult ritual by an unseen force. The next morning Zach and Sam wake with no memory of the night before, returning home from the honeymoon Sam discovers she is pregnant, despite having taken birth control pills since the wedding day, they are shocked, but overjoyed, telling friends and family, and after their first ultrasound scan they are told the healthy looking baby is due by the end of March. Through the course of the pregnancy though strange things are happening, with Sam having constant nosebleeds, bruising on her stomach, cravings for raw meat despite being a vegetarian, super- strength and telekinetic abilities and unexplained feelings of rage when she or the baby are threatened, also odd-looking people have been randomly watching their house. Zach is convinced something is wrong with the baby, they are seen by a new doctor at the second scan, he may be from the cult who have placed tiny camera in the McCall's home to monitor her progress and make sure she does not hurt the baby that she has become uncomfortable having. Eight months pass, attending holy communion the couple and all people in the church are shocked to see priest Father Thomas (Forrest Gump's Sam Anderson) violently coughing blood during the service, later Zach reviews footage he filmed, he recognises the taxi driver and sees a strange symbol, the priest in hospital recognises the symbol as relating to the summoning of the Antichrist, and investigating a thought to be abandoned house at the end of the street Zach finds the CCTV footage of inside his house, he barely manages to escape before the cult return and perform a ritual. Returning home Zach hears Sam scream and all house glass smashes, he finds her in a trance-like state with a knife to her chest, there is a blast of light, he recovers and finds her lying in her own blood with a cut to the stomach, she cries and wonders if the baby is alright before dying, Zach breaks down grieving and then the taxi driver and second doctor appear, they take the baby regardless of his pleas, Zach is arrested and interrogated by police about his wife's death and the baby's disappearance, we do not find out his fate, but another couple on honeymoon in Paris are lured into a taxi by the same driver. Also starring Robert Belushi as Mason, Catherine Kresge as Tina, Aimee Carrero as Emily, Sloane Coe as Ashley, Tyler Forrest as Steve, Stacie Davis as Karen and Yohance Myles as Jim. I didn't realise before watching this film that it was a \"found footage\" setup, so I expected similarities to The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity, the first half of the film start well and you sort of get into it, but I eventually got tired of the plot, I agree there are the odd jumpy and creepy moments, as an overall film I was a little disappointed, but its not the most terrible horror film.

            "content": "Devil's Due (2014) 1/2 (out of 4) The latest awful horror movie has newlyweds Samantha and Zach (Allison Miller, Zach Gilford) excited to be expecting their first child but soon strange things start to happen to the woman and it appears something sinister is going on. DEVIL'S DUE had quite an impressive campaign, which included fans converting to Satanism on Facebook, condoms dedicated to the movie and there was even a mutant baby gag that was going through New York City. The company spent all this money for promotional material but it's really too bad they didn't spend some of that cash on an actual screenplay. Yet another found footage film, this here is without question one of the worst as we're given nearly 90-minutes of boredom with two people we really don't care about. The entire plot is so boring and predictable that I'd recommend you take some rat poison into the screening with you if you must see this. We've seen possession movies countless times before and this one here offers nothing new. We've got a mother with an unknown past. We've got the couple going to a far away location where something happens after them being drugged. We got creeps watching them. We got a husband not knowing what's going on. Blah, blah, blah. I was bored out of my mind around the thirty-minute mark so the next hour really dragged at a horrid pace. What's so stupid that there's pretty much nothing going on in this picture. It's one of those movies where we have 80+ minutes of build-up in hopes of some exciting ending but there two problems. One, the ending is stupid and not scary. Two is that the build-up is just boring and painful to sit through. For the life of me I can't figure out why they didn't try to do more with this so-called horror movie. There are no good scares and even worse is that there are countless unintentional laughs. The only good thing I'll say about this picture is that the two leads are good in their roles. DEVIL'S DUE is yet another cheap horror movie and certainly one of the worst in recent years.",

            "review_title": "A painfully boring pregnancy documentary",
            "content": "When Eli Roth tweeted that Devil's Due is \"so smart, creative, inventive, and fun. Very very scary\", I felt an urge to believe him. However, this was before I remembered the franchise Roth is behind; Hostel, a series of horror films infamous for their gory, obscene content that has divided fans of the genre, to say the least. I have a feeling that Devil's Due may lead to the same result. I for one, strongly oppose this \"horror\" film.Directed by Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, half of the filmmaking collective Radio Silence, the supernatural horror film focuses on a nauseating newlywed couple, Sam (Allison Miller) and Zach (Zach Gilford), receiving the joyful surprise that Sam has fallen pregnant after a mysterious lost night on their honeymoon. Even here there are many frustrating aspects of the film; the couple are so naive that even after Sam's palms are read and the psychic begins urging, \"they're waiting for you\", complete with piercing red eyes, they allow a seemingly unlicensed taxi driver to take them for some \"divertido\" in the backstreets of Santo Domingo. From here they are led through some shoddy red doors into an underground cave/party of some sort, where Sam remarks that there are men watching her from the other side of the venue - one of them being the taxi driver - before the camera cuts out and opens in yet another dark cave, where a Satanic ritual takes place with an unconscious Sam and Zach. This may sound like a vague description, but unfortunately Devil's Due is a vague film - in their struggles to try and make the found- footage style seem authentic, the directors instead create a frustratingly weak and boring storyline that meanders through ninety minutes of nothingness.Although classified as a horror film, the attempts to scare the audience or even make them uncomfortable are non-existent. Instead of watching a horror film this genuinely feels like a documentary on pregnancy, with more time spent focusing on Sam feeling tired or in pain than anything else. There are a few scenes that begin to feel uncomfortable, yet they result in absolutely nothing; for example, during a surprise party held at Sam and Zach's house, Sam claims that she needs a rest. The many security cameras placed in various hidden areas of the house by an unknown clan (these plot holes are left completely unexplained) show her make her way upstairs, before entering the nursery ready for the baby and beginning to carve a large symbol into the floor. A young girl, presumably a member of the family, begins playing hide and seek with a friend/sibling/cousin/relative/boyfriend/acquaintance, complete with a video camera set to night vision. She meanders around the house in darkness for a few minutes, before entering the nursery, where she is welcomed by a demonic Sam screaming for her to get out. Surely this would lead to the family investigating the strange behaviour, right? No. Instead, we cut to the young girl's first communion at the local church, where she seems unfazed by the previous events, and when the priest in the church begins bleeding profusely in the presence of demonic Sam, nobody seems to react to her red eyes, her vacant stare, and her death grip on Zach's wrist.Everything seems to lack a resolution - whether we witness Sam eating raw meat from the butcher's aisle through supermarket CCTV, or we follow a trio of unknown teenagers as they find Sam devouring a dead animal in the woods before being telepathically murdered by an unseen force, none of these scenes lead into the next with a clear cause-and-effect storyline, making the film seem frustratingly disjointed and clunky. The events never escalate into the true horror form until the very last five minutes, during which we revisit a house touched upon extremely briefly earlier in the film, where the cult (which remains unexplained) gather to summon something I have no idea about. It isn't explained at all. I learnt more about ultrasound than the demonic offspring, which is what the film is supposed to be about. And after a rather entertaining sequence during which Zach returns home to find many mysterious members of the cult surrounding him, and his wife's labour causing the house to shake, rumble and almost self- destruct, the birth of the devil child is so underwhelming it actually infuriated me. I endured what seemed like hours upon hours of throwaway home movie footage to reach the climax of the film, during which Sam kills Zach's sister off-camera, Zach returns home to find the furniture flying across the home and his sister slumped in the corner of a bedroom with her insides laid next to her, and tries to comfort Sam which obviously doesn't work. Instead, she throws him across the room a few times (he still goes back to her) before pinning him to the wall in a crucifix pose and cutting open her stomach, before falling on the floor and dying. Zach cries over her bleeding body, telling her that she's fine, as the taxi driver enters the house, reaches into Sam's stomach and takes a perfectly normal crying baby, before leaving.That's it. That is the film. Actually, no, it isn't. Before the audience gets the sheer delight of the end credits, we see another sickly sweet newlywed couple bounce about the streets of central Paris, before hailing a taxi driven only by the taxi driver, who asks if they want to go somewhere fun. So whether the directors' intentions were to create plenty of questions for a sequel or if they simply forgot about half of the purely awful story they tried to create, Devil's Due is definitely an experience I never want to relive. I think I would rather have the offspring of Satan growing inside of me than watch this film again.2/10",

The pace is a little to slow you start to feel yourself drift from the film.& the acting is pretty well done to show a believable scene of a loving couple being happy together until all the strange things start happen some of it is extremely disturbing at time's. Although this film isn't really scary as most horror film of this genre can be this is very disturbing in a physiologically way , its one of those film that get in to you head but its not scary creep you out type of film although it has moment that make you jump at silly moments rather than horror moments.The movie takes place mostly in a nursery with only four characters there along with two hooded wardens. As such, there was a lot resting on the shoulders of these four, and ultimately they didn't really manage to pull it off. It wasn't because of their particular performance, but because the movie was suffering from a bad script and story line. However, compared to the Japanese movie in the same genre, \"Baby's Curse\", & immortal classic, ROSEMARY'S BABY, \"Devil's Due\" fared much better than these two film's.but these movies aren't particularly memorable or noteworthy, iver really. As said it start off pretty well but as i said the story is very weak in the direction of the film, i found the scene to be a little long for the film's story with the pace of the film its a big let down as it start to get predictable its nothing special that we haven't seen before & i think its this is why people are getting fed up with Found footage film's because there isn't anything surprising or hasn't been done before. All in all its not a bad film but its not a great film, it just could have been better, not that the actor's done a good job, it failed due to the writers of the film giving it weak & poor story-line with not plot other than a anti-Christ being born.This is one film you should just wait for the DVD instead of wasting money at the cinema.",

The problem is, when they don't work\u0085they're really awful. (Hated Chronicle\u0085 just putting that out there to be controversial) So, this movie is about\u0085 well\u0085 if you didn't put it together from the poster: After a mysterious, lost night on their honeymoon, a newlywed couple finds themselves dealing with an earlier-than-planned pregnancy. While recording everything for posterity, the husband begins to notice odd behavior in his wife that they initially write off to nerves, but, as the months pass, it becomes evident that the dark changes to her body and mind have a much more sinister origin.Sounds alright, and the main actors are\u0085likable enough. The movie just lacks any kind of substance. It settles for cheap scares and relies really heavily on the satanic imagery, and the shock value of the disturbing pregnancy. It has one to many \"that camera doesn't make sense\" moments, which always drive me nuts, and over all the movie just doesn't make a whole ton of sense. In general, this contributes to the over-saturation of the found footage genre, and will probably only serve to make people dislike them more. Unfortunately a miss.There are creepy moments, but not nearly enough to make it hold up.

Eventually circumstances lead to Zach believing there's something wrong with the pregnancy.Directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett of Radio Silence and projects Chad, Matt & Rob and the cult horror anthology V/H/S, Devil's Due marks Radio Silence's first mainstream foray with the film produced by 20th Century Fox and given significantly more resources than previous projects. The pair had been approached by other studios with more familiar \"haunted house\" type horror projects, but the duo went with Fox's pitch of Devil's Due believing it could be unique among the crowded horror slate with its focal point of a deteriorating relationship at its core. When the film was released in January 2014 it was unfavorably compared to Rosemary's Baby as well as lumped in with the previous year's widely reviled The Devil Inside. While Devil's Due is familiar, I don't think it's a bad movie and I do think that Olpin and Gillett deserve credit for taking a new approach to familiar material.While the movie is told from the point of view of a camcorder, this is not a found footage movie as its more akin to Chronicle in terms of its application of the format. With the opening studio logos and the multiple POVs from other sources, it's clear the filmmakers aren't taking this as a standard \"found footage\" format and are using it more for stylistic purposes. The movie tries to make itself stand out from Rosemary's Baby by taking a darkly comic slant to the material and for the most part I think it works. Zach Gilford and Allison Miller have good chemistry and are believable as a married couple and Miller's acting with regard to her deteriorating mental state is well done. The gore work is also quite well done with a good amount of blood and viscera utilized over the running time to mostly good effect. While the movie will be familiar to those who've seen this type of story before, I can give it a marginal recommendation thanks to its style and craft.",

            "content": "Demonic possession has been the most popular theme in the horror genre as of late. Paranormal Activity, The Conjuring, Insidious, and the list goes in, have all been the talk of the cinema at one point or another. Devil's Due takes a unique approach by neglecting to incorporate ghosts into the mix unlike its brothers and sisters.If you have ever heard of, or viewed Rosemary's Baby, it will ring bells and reveal where this take on possession received its inspiration. Is the former a bad place to learn from? Not at all. The problem lies in the fact that the 1968 version is a far superior film. And not just a far walk home from work. I'm talking as far as Canada is from Japan. Walking distance, no plane.This found footage take on Rosemary's Baby did have some things going for it at the start, but it all went away as the film progressed.A happy pair of newlyweds, Zach McCall (Zach Gilford) and Samantha McCall (Allison Miller) go to Dominican Republic for a classic honeymoon get-away. Everything looks wild and exciting, until a strange cab driver convinces them to try out a club nearby. Zach persuades Samantha that one more drink will be fun.The two end up drugged, and forget everything that happened. Viewers witness the camera picking up blurred images of creepy Satanic appearing rituals, as the couple are fast asleep. Once back home, Samantha reveals that she is pregnant.Joy surrounds the household, until the baby waiting process starts becoming very unusual for Samantha. Nose bleeds, and knock off your feet pains can occur at times for any future mother, but developing a carnivorous appetite, violent aggression, and telepathic powers are certainly not normal.Devil's Due did a good job with casting. The two leads are easy to like, and both know how to act. Both have potential to be in bigger and better movies, as they do have the talent. As good as it is to have focus on the characters, I cannot say I was entertained by how long it went on.It was simply happy family chatter, that added nothing to the plot. Zach is a cocky, funny guy who means well, while Samantha is a more laid back, sweet woman who lost her parents and grew up in foster care. They love each-other very much.I described the first forty minutes of character development in a ten second read.It never built up anything particularly special, minus the usual you would expect from this sort of film. People being dragged and tossed by an unseen force is just not amusing anymore. It has been done in Paranormal Activity and Quarantine already, no need for more of that.Nothing was scary or creepy. The jump scares, with the exception of one that caught me off-guard, were terribly obvious, and poorly concealed. A scene or two did have a cool, or humorous effect, standing out as more memorable than the rest.Other than painfully phony coughs by the priest (Sam Anderson), the happenings in the church led to an entertaining few minutes. When Samantha is walking through the grocery store, make sure to keep your eyes on the bystanders. Their reactions made me smile.The two parts I mentioned above were far more interesting than the climax and final few moments. Predictable, boring, and done before countless times. Not to mention the severe usage of plot holes in order to make this film progress conveniently.Without spoiling anything important, here is an example. A surprise party is thrown for Samantha, but she feels tired and goes upstairs. A child wonders up later, looking for the dog I believe. She wonders into a room, and gets scared off by a creepy, possessed looking Samantha.Does she go downstairs and make mention of this? Did no one else hear the loud pitched screams of terror? Is Zach going to question Samantha about it in the morning? Nope, explaining things would be difficult I suppose. A young child would surely run down crying, and make a big deal about it. The plot holes revealed in the last scene of a interrogation room are much worse. Asking yourself, \"How?\", can be expected.Found footage is far from my favorite type of film. Thankfully, Devil's Due managed to do one thing right. Instead of Zach carrying a camera around constantly, the film makes use of security camera's when in public, and cameras are placed around the house. It is clever, and makes more sense when you think about it.The bottom line is that this film brings nothing new to the table, or anything worth watching again. The majority of the acting is strong, but the characters themselves are not memorable or special. Scares may come for people who have never watched a horror film, or jump at their own shadow, but the experienced fans will walk out disappointed.If this is next on your list, I would advise waiting until it comes out on Netlix. And even than, ignoring it would still likely be the smartest decision. This demonic possession phase has run its course. In all honesty, the genius \"Devil Baby Prank\" used to market Devil's Due is scarier and more entertaining than the actual film itself.Superpower Film Scale: 1.5/51: Villainous Waste2: Careless Bystander3: Hero unaware of powers4.

The girl lost both her parents in a car accident and she had to be cut from her mothers womb. She was adopted and she considers them her real parents. They love each other, get married and go on their honey moon where they get lost, get offered a taxi ride by some random black guy and he takes them to an underground club. The girl gets taken to some room where she gets impregnated ritually is the anti-Christ. OK? Happy? I just saved you 45 minutes of your life. Fast forward and watch from there.SPOILER: I know I put spoiler as the tag but this is the real spoiler. What I told you there is a load of garbage. The only interesting part was when you found out she was cut from the womb of her dead mother.OK, so now it gets interesting. Sh*t starts happening around the house that can't be explained. The mother to be is acting crazed, scratching a symbol into the wooden floor of the babies room, she kills her husbands sister, her husband finds her and tries to stop his wife. She goes nuts and throws him with some sort of psychic ability from the anti-Christ but she never remembers anything that she does. He tries to stop her and she pins him up against the wall with psychic ability, she takes a knife and cuts open her womb, falls to the floor and comes back to herself. She dies moments later, the black taxi driver dude comes in with someone else, they remove the anti-Christ from her stomach and off they go so that's why at the beginning he's covered in blood and he's suspected of murdering his wife and sister and getting rid of the baby.That's the last 15 minutes of the movie that's actually interesting. It's not scary at all. The last 15 minutes is the only part an 8 year old couldn't watch. Terrible movie.

One of the main issues against this one is the rather bland and uninteresting premise that brings in the found-footage aspect simply for no purpose as this falls into the conventional trap so many similar efforts utilize here in that way too many scenes here would have little use to be filmed as there's no real concern for either the safety of the videographer at the time or the need to be incognito during filming so there's a large amount of scenes here that really don't need to be filmed in here. Likewise, the film also makes a cardinal mistake of not making the footage pertinent to the main storyline here since this one tends to feature the husband up on murder charges yet never once uses the footage shot in that case, tending to leave it a question as for why that was included in the first place as well as where and how the footage got edited together to make the film. there's little about this that makes sense as for why it was a found-footage movie other than being a gimmick to start with and it tends to leave the film really lacking. Another big flaw here is the first half is just not that scary in the first half here with this one really taking very few enjoyable turns here to really showcase any kind of enjoyable scares which this one seems to think it's full of. The scenes at the grocery store are just lame with her being a committed vegetarian and then scarfing down raw steak, a completely ill- focused freak-out on another vehicle shown through the security cameras from the store and her general crankiness and volatility towards her friends and family which are just not all that scary or thrilling and really causes the first half to feel far more drawn-out and dull than it really should as there's some decent material to work with here. The concept of the cult's activities on tourists by taking them willingly into their hideout to impregnate them with something sinister is a pretty unique and enjoyable take on the concept by making it appear to be done through their own voluntary means to allow them to operate in secret. The burgeoning pregnancy allows for the use of the cult symbols to really come out of nowhere and be a rather creepy motive that's quite unexpected and really draws a lot of unnerving story lines in here, and there's the final half hour which shows off all manner of enjoyable supernatural action with the encounter in the abandoned house, the race to get home and the attacks within as the birth is under way in a truly chilling and fantastic sequence. Still, there's more problems here that tend to lower this one.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Brief Nudity.",

It's just that this film is so incredibly awful that it brings the worst out of its viewers. My best friend and I were really looking forward to being scared. She's a fan of the Paranormal Activity series and I love slow, atmospheric horror movies where the focus is more on the characters than on throwing a bucket of blood on the screen. In other words, we were both the target audience for a film like this. This film was just awful. The scares weren't very scary, not even when they were really supposed to be. There were multiple scenes where we were all supposed to be watching the screen pensive and quiet, yet the ENTIRE audience was laughing. I think that the turning point came where, at a baby shower, Sam received a small knife that initially looked like a decorative silver rattle of some sort. That's when I crossed the line and went to the dark side. Laughing, I turned to my bestie and said \"Baby's first shiv!\" I immediately got a thumbs up from the row in front of me. After that point all of the audience started cracking jokes and laughing even louder at the incredibly un-funny scenes. There were only 10 of us in the audience, so I probably wouldn't have acted like that if it were more full, but this was a very bad movie and we all knew it. I think that part of the problem was that the found footage angle was so incredibly forced. If they'd dropped that entirely and focused on the story and scares, this would have been a lot better. I think that they focused on the FF angle mostly because of the directors' previous success with V/H/S. Because the film was so keen on trying to force the FF angle, everything was pretty dull and the FF aspect really felt superfluous. The worst part is that at its core, this had the potential to be very, very good. It's just that the movie tried too hard to cash in on the directors' previous success in the FF genre and bank on people holding fond memories of other similar films that are out there. There's nothing wrong with doing either of those things, but when you try to force it and it doesn't work, that's when you end up with something as awful as Devil's Due. That's the biggest crying shame: this could have been so much better if the directors and film company had tried to do something more original rather than imitate previously successes.",

It would be an interesting and fresh perspective on the tired genre as our hero has to go collect all the impossible footage, from the victims to the cameras in stores, on streets and sometimes even cop cars/interrogation rooms.Until then, we'll just continue getting crap like Devil's Due.So sad how little effort they put into this. Wait, let me retract\u0085they did spend a lot of time watching every single other found footage and supernatural movie to steal from. Most found footage movies are already unoriginal but this one really takes the prize for almost an entire movie of ripped off ideas.It's no secret that I also don't favor supernatural films much and they never, ever scare me. Worse, they continue to be progressively less creepy with each film. By the climax of this film, I was so uninterested, so bored, the \"shockfest\" of objects and people being forced about was just a yawn. Not only have we all seen it all before, it's just routine by now. What's the synopsis? Well, Rosemary's Baby but with countless people who have cameras that desperately hold onto them as if they were parachutes to a skydiver.I understand these films cost under ten dollars to make, so obviously they're profitable, but please, people, stop supporting this kind of uninspired \"art.\" It's depressing how people are using their gifts of filmmaking to create something this degrading. There is no reason to see this. You will gain nothing from these 90 minutes except for a sore neck from shaking it back and forth so much. * * *Final thoughts: (and these were my initial thoughts when seeing this) Just an FYI, the movie genre of found footage is: filled with plot holes, horribly unoriginal, makes little sense and, worst of all, lazy.

Normally, I don't have prejudices with remakes or rip-offs, but some well-honored and acclaimed films leave no room for that and, when that happens, we quickly find that the new movie is so inferior to the first one that it doesn't justify its existence. It's more or less what happens here. The plot is almost the same: Zach and Samantha are a couple on their honeymoon. However, after a party where both get drunk, Samantha feels she is raped during a satanic cult. On waking, however, they thinks this was a dream, not feeling any mistrust when she becomes pregnant. This will change over the course of her pregnancy, as Samantha takes on a strange behavior. The plot brings little new when compared to the classic film that precedes it and it's clearly inferior in quality. It all seems unrealistic, far-fetched and absurd, which is criminal in a film that had low production budget but a huge budget for advertising. The actors' performance is mediocre. Allison Miller and Zach Gilford are the main actors and they certainly tried to do their best, but the truth is that the material they were given was too bad and they just ended up dropping their characters. Personally, I don't blame them, I blame the directors (Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett) and screenwriter, Lindsay Devlin. The film spends most of its time focused on the changes of the pregnant girl, at a deliberately slow pace that would help create suspense if we didn't predict what would happen so easily, if the ending wasn't so uninteresting and if special effects weren't so basic.",

            "content": "The found footage genre has by now totally run its course. There is no shock or surprise or even an attempt at the feeling of authenticity. None the less producers and directors sensing a quick buck for little effort continue to make them,and audiences continue to watch them.The whole point of a found footage movie is that one can believe that what one is watching is real and is happening, but many directors are attempting to tell basically a linear movie story with multiple narrative strands using the technique which requires increasingly ridiculous attempts to include other sources and points of view catching things no one would actually be filming without explaining how and where the footage is coming from. This film is no exception.What we have is essentially \"Rosemary's baby \"via the found footage horror style. Everything plays out exactly as you would imagine it would, featuring a rich couple with a big house that is impossibly good, finding evil in a sinister and dangerous far away foreign locales where evil naturally thrives.They trust a sinister black taxi driver and suffer the consequences when she becomes pregnant with nothing the less than the devil's baby! (Via dark Satanic mass in Latin etc) Complications ensue at an extremely leisurely pace.I give this film kudos in 2014 for still having the \"Evil Moor\" as agent of the Devil, a device many believed had disappeared in Mediaeval times! That said, the acting is not bad and the two leads (Alison Miller and Zach Gilford)here are really very convincing and likable , unlike the awful norm for the genre.The story goes exactly as you imagine from the trailers, very slowly, a pregnancy home video with the (very occasional) scare like scary noises, eating raw meat, priests with nasty nosebleeds etc.Things get mildly interesting in the last ten minutes then everything ends anticlimactically with more questions than answers.However it is not quite as bad as it looks in trailers (though that is no compliment in itself!) and if you understand what you're going to see and realise its no big scary horror movie but basically a pregnancy home video with a diabolical edge then you should be entertained.The final coda suggests they are going for a franchise ..... \" Beware the taxi driver!\" Watch this space folks!",

            "content": "'Rosemary's Baby' meets 'Paranormal Activity' in what is possibly the most uninspired \"found-footage\" low budget horror since, well, 'Paranormal Activity 2'. What could've been an engaging metaphor on the bodily and emotional fluctuations during pregnancy is actually a tame snooze-fest that never seemed to end. 89 minutes felt like an eternity, and my cognitive inhibition was in full swing. Summoning the Antichrist should've been way more exciting and psychologically stimulating. A newly married couple jet off to the Dominican Republic for their honeymoon, where the wife gets mysteriously pregnant.As the title leaves little to one's imagination, the Devil is certainly due. Showcasing every typical horror clich\u00e9 from the frickin' book. They are all here! Why does the camera glitch when something \"exciting\" happens? Devil's Due, that's why. Why does she crave raw ground beef from her local supermarch\u00e9, despite being a vegetarian? Obviously because Devil's Due. Why does she kill a small group of innocent deers and then proceed to frolic with some youths who happen to be filming their random trip to the river? It can only be because Devil's Due. Why does no one turn any lights on and instead proceed to use night vision because everyone wants to flipping record everything? Devil's Due, simple. Why do they let a different doctor perform an amniocentesis if they are already suspicious of him? Devil's God damn Due. Why are all the doctors shocked to see patients in their rooms? Devil's Du...no wait, nope that's not the Devil's fault. Move along. Why does their dog bark at hidden cameras in their house for seven seconds and then never bark at them again? Devil's Due for some doggy time. Why do they stupidly proceed to enter an underground club that looks completely unauthorised and cultish? Well, that's just down to stupidity. And finally, why does the whole repeat again? Second Devil's Due (that'll be the sequel...).If anything, I think this film warns us not to trust taxis.

            "content": "Anytime I can see something in a movie or character that I can personally relate to I'm more apt to be drawn into the flick. Between an above average trailer, and outstanding promo video on YouTube and the fact that my wife is pregnant with our third child, Devil's Due was high on my list of flicks to see early in 2014. Sadly... I did just that.PLOT: About 10 seconds in, we're shown how the movie ends with a guy sitting in an interrogation room answering questions about his wife's death to which he responds, \"I didn't do it\". But I'm getting ahead of myself. Zach (Zach Gilford) and Samantha McCall (Allison Miller) get married and head to the Dominican on their honeymoon. On their last night there, they visit a palm reader who proceeds to tell Sam, \"They've been waiting for you\". We're not told who \"they\" are at this point but this naturally freaks Sam & Zach out. So... rather than doing what every normal couple would do and simply returning to their hotel, they proceed to follow a pushy cab driver to an underground club in a foreign country and engage in an alcohol fueled dance party. Sam gets black out drunk and she's involved in some sort of ritual which we're shown bits and pieces of.Now home, they find out that Sam is pregnant. As her pregnancy proceeds, Sam begins to experience nosebleeds, bruising, weird food cravings (raw meat), aggression, telekinetic abilities and feelings of rage. The couple begins to feel that they're being watched and that there may be something wrong with the baby despite her doctor's suggestion to the contrary.They attend a first communion of a family member and the same priest who married Sam & Zach (Sam Anderson) is presiding. He begins to cough and hemorrhage blood from his nose and mouth during the ceremony. Zach begins to review the hours of pointless footage he's been taking and sees the crazy cab driver from their honeymoon. Zach then investigates the creepy abandoned house on their block only to find close circuit TVs of his home set up and a bunch of cult(ish) looking members. He escapes and returns home where he hears Sam screaming and the house in shambles. When he finally finds her, she's in the nursery holding a knife which she received from an anonymous person at her baby shower. She telekinetically blasts Zach against the wall and slices open her belly. When Zach comes to he's covered in blood and finds his wife laying in a pool of blood wondering where their baby is before she dies. The baby had been taken out of her womb by creepy cabby and some random dude. We're re-shown the interrogation scene from the beginning and the film ends with another blissfully happy couple being taken to an off the beaten path place by crazy cab driver guy.THOUGHTS: I'll start by saying I'm not a big fan of found footage films. I find them to be a cheap way out and a way for studios to make an inexpensive horror film.That being said, Devil's Due had me super excited. The premise is great, the trailer was good and we were treated to a pretty outstanding promo video called Devil Baby Attack which as it turned out was better than the movie as it... you know... actually showed a baby.If you can't tell by the tone of this review thus far I really didn't enjoy this one. First of all, as I've already covered they buried the lead. Right up front we know dude is going to survive and get caught while girl is not around. Sort of a buzz kill but I could let it slide as I've seen films play with timeline very effectively. This one doesn't. Rather than doing the jump around game that films such as Pulp Fiction or Saw II do so well, this one just showed us the end at the beginning and then showed us how we got there. Snooze.I'm not quite sure why this movie is even rated R. Aside from the belly cutting scene in the last 3 minutes of the movie (which isn't even all that graphic. Lori's impromptu C-section on The Walking Dead was much more barbaric), there's hardly any blood, no nudity, very little bad language and not even an on screen death that I can remember.The story that we're given is pretty weak as all we're really told is by the priest: The Antichrist is coming. Um... OK. We're given a little bit of background about Sam as apparently she was cut from her dying mother's womb and was then orphaned but it's not enough to build a character around.I don't want to completely blast the film. Both of the leads do an outstanding job. They both manage to pull off this found footage in a way that makes you actually thing you're watching real footage. Their facial expressions, the tone in their voices, inflection, etc. is spot on and looks like legit home video footage. Sam Anderson's convulsion scene is very well acted as well, though he plays it a bit \"cooky\" when he's giving us plot points while frantically praying the rosary in the hospital.Perhaps I've seen too many of these flicks but I could tell just by the camera angles whether I should be looking at the character in the shot or in the background. Multiple times I'd be looking in the background of the shot and sure enough there goes dude walking across the screen ala The Strangers. The good news is this was early in 2014 so we could get it out of the way and go on to bigger and better things later in the year. Strong not recommend.",

            "content": "Even though this film isn't billed as a found footage film that is exactly what it feels like. That's not a bad thing in itself, but unfortunately this film seems to follow the tradition of found footage films...We are treated to a long tedious first half with an annoying couple spouting ridiculous dialogue. The majority of this dialogue is inane and does nothing to advance the plot. In fact probably the only aspect of the first half of the film that has any relevance to the plot is where our couple meet with the psychic. The biggest problem with this narrative style is that it not only makes for a dull film, but it also ends up antagonising your audience and actually makes you hate the characters that you're supposed to care for.Things do improve in the second half once the plot kicks in and our newlyweds do at least become less annoying as the film progresses. This film is billed as a 'Horror' but to me a horror film should be scary. However, for me, this film was 'shocking' rather than scary and there is a difference. A good horror film will keep you continuously scared and will leave you scared even when the credits are rolling. A film that shocks makes you flinch because you're shocked at what you see at that particular moment, not because it scares you. It didn't help that most of the time you could predict when the scares would come and what trick the filmmakers would employ simply because so much of this has been recycled from other horror films.The film isn't even great from a technical aspect; the camera work was shoddy (the camera was shaking about all over the place as if a drunk had got hold of it). The lighting was pretty poor as well. These aspects can perhaps be forgiven as this film was clearly made on a budget.The writing is inconsistent at best; Samantha's behaviour becomes increasingly erratic, but her idiot husband put it down to hormones - of course every woman smashes car windows and has psychotic episodes in church when they're pregnant. It just isn't believable that any rational human being would class this as normal behaviour. Devil's due isn't the worst film of its kind that I've seen, but it's far from the best film of its kind and that's the problem. In my opinion, this just isn't worth watching.",

I could well believe this film was made from offcuts of Paranormal Activity, The Last Exorcism, Sinister, The Conjuring and the like. It's pretty easy to figure out exactly how it's going to pan out after the first half hour of the movie.A redeeming feature of the movie is that the CGI is pretty well done, the scenes with people being tossed around like ragdolls was reminiscent of the Carrie reboot or Chronicle, both of which are much finer movies in very different ways.Sadly the ending of the movie leaves it open for a sequel.

The girl has her palm read. The reader tells her that \"she was born from death\" and that \"they are waiting for her.\" The friendly taxi driver offers to take them to a \"fun\" and \"special\" place. Sound familiar? It's a club out in the slums that's in a cave of sorts. The two get wasted, and they take the girl and do a ceremony with her over a Euro symbol, which we end up seeing everywhere.They go back to the US, find out she's pregnant, she starts acting weird, weird stuff starts happening. She has some type of powers but we don't know what she's up to or what she wants. Finally, 15 minutes before the movie ends we get some action and an attempt to get to the issue. The cab driver makes an appearance, there's chants, and the girl freaks out as her due date is getting closer and closer.Devil's Due combines all clich\u00e9s of strangers in a foreign land, pregnant women, evil babies, priests, etc. that you've seen dozens of times before into one single, unbelievably lame POV movie. Most POV movies are lame. And this one is no different. All the intro peaceful times scenes are dull and pointless. When things start getting creepy we don't know what or why. There's the usual annoying green screen camera. And just as the movie finally is about to come to an end, things get hectic. No explanation is provided, no point is made. The better scenes of the movie ended up in the deleted scenes section. Don't miss those if you make the mistake of watching this movie. You can't really care about the couple, they are dull as heck. While the girl is pretty she and/or her character have no personality or charisma.I'll grant though that Devil's Due features two neat aspects and improvements over every other horror POV movie. The image is at least crisp and sharp, and it features a couple of scenes of people holding cameras who're being thrown and yanked around. One really cool one has the guy lifted into the sky well above a tree line and then dropped on a car. Aside from this, Devil's Due is a complete waste of time.

It's almost surprising, if it's not so sad that the producer or director once thought imitation of other horror films could be a substitute for real tension. Furthermore, displaying it in found footage style doesn't add anything, let alone mask the unoriginality.The lackluster story is about two couples who happily spend their honeymoon, but in the end meet with dubious characters. After some bizarre forgettable occurrence, the bride is pregnant. No, this is not Hangover, although it would've been better. What follows is a mix between pregnancy scare and overused gimmicks. The theme has been used before, but this is acceptable, many movies use already proved formula and produces new material. Devil's Due, on the other hand, cobbles together pieces of other works in hope of anyone who hasn't watched horror movies in years will find it amusing.Its use of found footage mechanic further confuses the plot, because some of the scenes shouldn't have been captured in the first place. It uses all security cameras which are in vicinity of the story, it's not only one vlogger type, yet it still feels unauthentic and staged to capture certain scenes. It probably would've been slightly better if it's done in simple third person view.There's not much excellence in acting either, the usual scream and frantic gaze. As an intimate experience of maternity, the movie could've depicted more personal issue. The scares aren't much better, often showing people in trance or shouting randomly. Every part of the movie is dull, any horror it has is watered down because it's near exact replica of others.Granted, those who had or having the delicate 9 months marathon could appreciate it better, but why would they watch this movie, why would anyone for that matter?",

One fatal flaw in this film is the lack of a real sense of continuity, there are too many disconnects in the flow of things. The second is the use of \"other\" inexplicable cameras. Obviously, it is not the husbands camera during certain scenes, there is a store surveillance camera for example, a hikers camera, and several others. The origin of the others is only revealed later, then the audience has an \"ah huh!\" moment.

And can someone with some authority please, please, PLEASE tell those guys in the movie-business that we, the horror-fans for who they (supposedly) make these films, are totally fed-up with the lamer-than-lame found-footage concept! It's all here again, the shaky footage, the static disturbances to make it look more real (though MY camera never does that!), and the preposterous premise that someone runs around with a camera all of the time, even during unexpected crises. The most unrealistic thing is that this totally love-sick couple shouldn't have viewed their honeymoon-footage hundreds of times with their family or in private after arriving home, so they could have seen what really happened during the mysterious party. Why the camera suddenly started to record on that crucial moment isn't explained anyway - or maybe we are to understand that it's the magnetic aura of the devil? Well, the one good thing in this movie is the acting by both the leads, they were very natural and charming in the beginning and convincingly turned into a very concerned husband and a gradually being possessed wife. But that cannot save one and a half hour of tedious and unnecessary movie.",

            "content": "After a mysterious, lost night on their honeymoon, Samantha (Allison Miller) & Zach (Zach Gilford) McCall, a newlywed couple, finds themselves dealing with an earlier-than-planned pregnancy. While recording everything for posterity, the husband begins to notice odd behavior in his wife that they initially write off to nerves, but, as the months pass, it becomes evident that the dark changes to her body and mind have a much more sinister origin.Devil's Due is another entry into the camera POV genre (it's not really a \"lost footage found\" movie), but unfortunately it's not really one of the best and it's actually a bit of an alternative take on Rosemary's Baby.The movie starts out well enough, but it doesn't really build up from any point onwards and kind of stays the same throughout. There are moments when you think that things would starts getting better, and the plot would develop more, but unfortunately it doesn't. There are a couple of decent moments in the movie and some mildly freaky scenes, but other than that it's pretty much a big miss.One thing that didn't sit well with me was that Zach is recording & documenting everything for posterity, but the very 1st time he actually checks on something is about 6 months into Samantha's pregnancy (a lot of strange happenings have went on prior to this moment). I mean who wouldn't watch back what they have recorded for the previous day? It may be just a little thing, but it's just one thing that irked me.Apart from the few odd moments here and there as I previously mentioned, it's all rather flat and it's a shame because the two directors, Matt Bettinelli-Olpin & Tyler Gillett, had an enjoyable hit with V/H/S but I feel that Devil's Due is a step in the wrong direction for them. Hopefully they have a better hit with their next project.Watchable but nothing to get excited about.",

Nothing is explained to the viewer, for example, what happened when the lead, Samantha, was born? and this seems to be a key aspect of the story. And also the ritual during which Samantha gets pregnant is very sketchy at best. It follows the same vein as far to many other Horror films out there but fails to deliver on every level.",

Horrors that dabble in satanic rituals should be certificate 18; it should be able to cater to adults and increase its gore and shock factor. But instead horrors are now made to cater for 15 year olds. This leads to moments that are obvious instead of downright horrifying. Gruesome scenes are depleted and most annoyingly they try to add comedy. A horror film should be packed full of suspense and frights; not one or two to make a teenage girl scream; i want moments that are going to make me (a grown man) scream.

It is so much worse than you could possibly imagine.When a film is terrible, truly Devil's Due is one of the worst films I've ever seen, it is hard to choose a starting point for a review. While trying to formulate a procedural direction you think of each infuriatingly poor decision on behalf of the writer and director and how wasting 89 minutes of your life was easily avoidable.A recently wed couple, Sam and Zach, embark on their honeymoon to a tropical destination. On their final night they go off the beaten path to an underground party at the behest of their taxi-driver. Sam discovers she is pregnant almost immediately after they return home. The rest of Devil's Due is about the alleged terrifying events unfolding around \u2013 and inside of \u2013 her.As a couple, Allison Miller and Zach Gilford are far from distinct, compelling or even believable. Allison Miller's Sam is cute but about as basic as you can get \u2013 case and point: she hugs a juicer she receives as a wedding present. Gilford painfully overacts as the cheesy newly-hubbied other half. He intrusively catalogs their whole life together, obnoxiously toting his video camera everywhere he goes, making sure it is always in focus, perfectly framed and well lit even when his wife is doubled over in pain.Devil's Due is touted as a 'found footage' film. If one more cheesy camcorder style horror movie is released I am going to dig up and then punch Jerome Lemelson's corpse in the face. Apparently a hand-held camera is not enough for our character Zach in Devil's Due. In addition, he is a creepy pervert with hidden cameras throughout the house to capture life as well. Yet it also utilizes security footage at a grocery store, secret cameras in every room of the couple's house and police interrogation footage. This lack of direction must be what happens when there are two directors, Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, working on one film.All the exasperatingly frustrating facepalm-worthy horror clich\u00e9s are included in Devil's Due thanks to inexperienced screenwriter Lindsay Devlin. The plot is not new, not interesting and insanely moronic. Immediately, the main characters obliviously follow a stranger down a dark alley while in a foreign country to go to an unmarked party. Later, all the footage husband Zach painstakingly films is never actually reviewed, let alone uploaded to a hard-drive, so one must assume he buys his SD cards in bulk. Further, the transformation within Sam is purely incidental as the demonic fetus becomes stronger in her womb. In the meantime there is enough stagnating filler scenes to grind the film to an immediate halt.There is nothing redeemable about Devil's Due and the fact it was even released, let alone in mainstream movie theaters, is baffling.Find more FULL movie reviews of recent releases at our website.",

The movie does have some scary moments, and of course some jump scares. I do like the premise, and I was interested to see this movie, because it was directed by one of the VHS directors. The mystery in the film was pretty interesting. I like the fact that the husband is trying to figure out why his wife is not normal. The found footage in the movie was a bit scary at times. The only parts that annoy me were the jump scares that pop up. Is it as bad as the critics says it is, surprisingly it's not, so yeah I don't think it's a bad movie. Overall I say it's a decent horror movie, at least it was way better than The Devil Inside, that movie sucked. In my opinion this movie is good to watch at night.

I'm a devout Horror fan and I make sure to give them a chance from time to time, but so far I am yet to find a film from these categories that I honestly enjoy.Devil's Due is seen through the eyes of a few camera (made possible by the script making sure the plot involves surveillance hidden cams placed inside the house). I do have to say that the cast did a good job acting \"realistically\", making suspension of disbelief easier. However, that is the last good thing I have to say.The story is nice at best, and lacks originality, innovation or twists. We've seen similar plots not only in 11.11.11, but the famous cult film Rosemary's Baby. On that note, it feels like Devil'a Due is nothing more than a Rosemary remake (if that was the original goal - then okay, well done, gave the same paranoid sensation).Nothing innovative, nothing impressive, nothing to make this film worth watching or remembering. After struggling, I decided to go with a 4. Perhaps a 5 would have been more objective, but there's a limit to how merciful one could be. This is just my opinion of course.

The acting is not too convincing either and that is a problem for this type of film; you're supposed to be seeing 'reality' not just a movie. There's some fun in pretending the movie is found footage, but this movie doesn't really pretend to be found footage, instead it is simply filmed in that style. It is the found footage style without trying to convince you it is 'really' found footage. Sure we all know found footage isn't real so why make it even harder to believe?The acting is not very convincing either which is a very bad thing for a film that is supposed to be 'real'.At least I didn't stop the movie halfway through.

Once the seance happened, I thought, \"Oh, so this has nothing to do with her being born from death, which would've been a lot more interesting and cooler.\" The problem turns out NOT to be ALREADY her, it BECOMES her because of the SEANCE...and really, it's actually the evil group who keeps performing it on couples.

After the promos with the demon baby in the stroller & watching the trailers for the movie, figured it looked scary enough for me. I'm a HUGE horror fan, scarier the better...I was really looking forward to seeing the evil baby... WELL...this movie was a HUGE disappointment...not only was it NOT scary or even creepy, but it had no plot, no storyline... There was a reference to some ancient symbol which COULD have meant someone was trying to connect with Satan...but nothing ever came of it. When the baby was finally born, the doctor held it & that was it! No mention to what it looked like, nothing was said. Baby didn't cry...nothing! It was worse than the Soprano's ending into nothingness.. All I can say is thank GOD I went on discount Tuesday, because if I had paid full price to see this garbage, I would have demanded my money back! STAY FAR AWAY from this movie! With what can be done with today's make- ups, special effects & horror plots, this fell flat on it's face! Stay home & watch American Horror Story on Netflix! SO much better than this POS movie!",

Very similar to The Blair Witch Project (though at least for that movie, it was fairly original). I can't watch a film like this without feeling like I'm going to throw up after about 5 minutes. So I will confess I zipped thru this movie on fast forward and skipped maybe 60% of it, so it is theoretically possible I missed some meaningful substance... but I don't think so.Basically it seemed the story developed very slowly. And the suspenseful/action scenes that appeared maybe 2/3 of the way into the movie had the cheesy feel of an amateur video or someone playing with their camcorder to try to create special effects. Not horrible, but borderline silly.",

Otherwise, it's the same F.F. dreck : cameras being perfectly aimed and focused even though character is being chased by death or in the most ridiculous situations like \"oh, you just got stabbed in the head so let me put my phone exactly in perfect position to film this instead of dropping it to help you stop the bleeding. \", or access to public/private camera footage. The found footage gimmick was absolutely crammed onto this script which would have been a completely successful in traditional format with normal angles and MUSICAL ENHANCEMENT (another money-saving shortcut force fed to us in FF titles.) A slow plodding build with a smattering of odd events until the chaotic burst of supernatural activity at the end with the final scene of death. Clumsy and forced ad-libs and improvisation instead of a precise script. Gotcha scenes filmed in night-vision . While Devils Due is not the worst of the gimmick, it suffers from a threadbare storyline with plot holes and gotcha's you can see coming a mile away because you've seen the exact same thing 100 times by now.",

What was once a nice niche to get away from the giant blockbusters, has slowly, but surely, become a virus to us all. That may be a bit harsh to a film like Devil's Due, but the whole genre in general needs a break.. and fast.**Warning, this review does contain spoilers** Watching these horror found footage films nowadays, especially Devil's Due, made me ponder what it would have been like in a nice short cut of 15 minutes in the V/H/S franchise. Clocking in at only an hour and 20, the film still finds ways to stretch. Instead of the wedding, why not start at the honeymoon? Instead of Zach (Zach Gilford) the good intentioned husband making his 4th call on the phone explaining his wife is acting strange, why not move the plot along? Instead of the first doctor, why not start with the creepy one? Yes, the second doctor is creepy, but that's also another problem. Subtly is not the films strong suit. Oh, the Priest is coughing, because he's near the demon baby. I see... And now Samantha (Allison Miller) is turning into Tetsuo from Akira? Because the Anti-Christ growing inside her just isn't interesting enough.Found footage also ruins everything that's happening always. The film does try to do different things, \"mini chest cam\" for one, but what person would see their pregnant wife in incredible pain or smashing the windows of a stranger's car and not drop the camera? And what 7 year old walks around in complete darkness with night vision? I get the spooky element everyone on set wants to make, but it's just puzzling and not well thought out. In this scene the girl is scared by Samantha, which could have been, again, subtly expressed in the next scene when she sees the girl again the next day at the church, but, they decided to go with the coughing priest instead. The cab driver from the beginning of the film in the church was a nice touch, but these are too few and far in between.Though the whole premise is found footage, the question begs, who found the footage. The cult seemingly takes everything, setting up Zach, so who's showing the footage? The Cult? Did they get their hands on the interrogation of Zach as well? Was one of the cops part of the cult? It sure was nice of them to edit the thing together though, for us all to learn about their Devil cult. Because in other found footage movies, the footage is usually found by someone other than the killer. Who, in retrospect, probably wouldn't turn it over to the public for viewing. A Demon in Paranormal Activity, after killing a family, wouldn't use Final Cut and say, \"Hey everyone, look what I did.\" Maybe they would, Demon's are kind of jerks.The good is definitely Allison Miller. She works with what she has and runs away with it. I hope she has a future, because she's really the only redeemable thing to the film. Much better films are Rosemary's Baby, The Omen and even To the Devil a Daughter.",

It is a total rip off of the Paranormal Activity movies, using the same effects, same type of story, and even shot the exact same. I know it's much cheaper to shoot a movie this way, but it's getting a little old. At least throw something new in the movie. But that did not happen. It's like I already saw this movie. So here's the plot. Some guy just happens to decide to start recording his life on camera and his wife just so happens to become possessed during the next few days. Or is that the plot of Paranormal Activity? I don't know, it's all the same. I did like the use of witchcraft in this movie. I found that quite entertaining, though i wish they brought that out more. It was the only original thing in the movie, which played such a minute part. It kind of reminded me of Susperia for a second which made me excited, but kept up with the lame, predictable way out.So poor writing, but I did like the acting. Mainly because I have a massive crush on actress Allison Miller. She did a good job on the film, seeing the knock off trash that she had to work with. She should be more careful in choosing movies to star in. All in all, I gave this movie a 3. I think it's well deserved. If you are going to rip off movies, rip off movies that were done many years ago. If you are about to see this movie, just watch Paranormal Activity instead and you will watch the exact same movie, but it would be much more worth the time.",

It's one in a long string of \"found footage\" films that doesn't add anything new to the genre, and falls below an even average, by-the-numbers example. It started out sort of intriguing, but it deteriorated quickly. There's lots of little weird scenes that don't seem to add much other than to show the \"strangeness\" of the child/Sam's behavior. For example, her penchant for eating raw meat - captured in a slightly funny supermarket scene, and later in an utterly pointless woods scene with some random characters who show up for no reason other than being killed off. Why would the Antichrist make someone eat raw meat? He's fighting back against all the vegetarians? This is just one example of many pointless scenes/tropes.The end (last 30 minutes or so) was what really killed the movie for me. Although it's filled with decent effects as others have noted, it's basically 30 minutes of Zach running around shouting, \"Sam! Sam! No, Sam!\" and shlt flying around. Killed any slight enjoyment I had. I loved the directors' \"10/31/1998\" segment in the original V/H/S (in fact, maybe my favorite segment of that movie), which bears some similarities to this film, but this fails to have the twists or originality that \"10/31/1998\" had.",

Whatever didn't make it to the marketing campaign is the lowest level quality you'd ever expect - even from a found footage film.I'd mention characters but I can only scarcely say that they even exist. It seems that halfway through the film, everything sort of goes silent. No two characters communicate after a certain point and its very hard to believe that Sam and her utterly forgettable husband ever had any connection romantically at all. As well, the husband has no reason to suspect anything is wrong when he finally decides that there must be, indeed, something wrong. However, when things are obvious he operates in a wish-washy manner where he can't quite decide what he is doing or what is going on.The climax to this movie? I won't spoil it (obviously) but it is barely even there - almost as if this movie is begging for a sequel that nobody will ever want. Needless to say, I didn't like this movie - either did anyone else who was in the room with me as I watched it.

There comes a point in any film reliant on hand-held camera's where sanity dictates you would put the camera down. This film tries to get around that by stealing ideas from paranormal activity which would be great if the rooms being filmed weren't near pitch black and all characters seem to be allergic to flipping on a light switch. The husband had me screaming at the screen(not in the way intended by the filmmakers)for his complete inability to achieve anything but say his wife's name repeatedly. In one scene the husband stumbles around ,refusing to use any available artificial light and repeating his wife's name until discovering the body of his sister almost as an afterthought. There comes a point where any person, whether sane or allergic to light switches, would reach for any kind of weapon but nooooo our hero prefers to sound about as tough as an eight year old in telling the hooded figures surrounding his house to 'Go away'. This style of horror used to be innovative. I remember watching Blair Witch in the cinema and being terrified of the clashing rock sounds over the end credits which was a intelligent way of wringing one more scare out of the audience. This isn't innovative, this isn't good (the scene in the forest is the low point of, well consistent low points)I'd recommend it to someone I didn't like but am too busy checking my light bulbs, looking for makeshift weapons(even a slipper could hurt in the right hands)and tentatively exploring whether my girlfriend has been impregnated by the devil while I was a little bit drunk",

They shouldn't of made the characters be the ones who record), the camera was shaky the whole movie. You could never have a proper look at the setting or anything because the cameras just shook all the time. The scares were the worst because they weren't even scary.These dumb people called Zach and Samantha are on their honeymoon. They go to some random place and meet their taxi driver. The taxi driver is in some cult thing but THEY GO WITH HIM!!! HAVE THEY NOT LEARNT STRANGER DANGER YET BECAUSE THEY LITERALLY DECIDED TO GO TO SOME PARTY WITH A TAXI DRIVER THEY JUST MET. Well yeah, something bad happens so we can't blame anyone but Sam and Zach. The taxi driver does some weird cult voodoo magic thing or some spell from Harry Potter and it gets the girl pregnant.They go home, weird stuff starts happening and Sam goes crazy like absolutely CRAZY!!! Some little girl and boy who are related to Sam are playing hide and seek in Zach and Sams house (I think it's their) and one of the little kids go up and then Sam gives a 'Jump scare' which wasn't even scary and is like \"GET OUT\" because she wanted some space to carve some random Satan or cult symbol. Sam was always carving some symbol into her floor because she was a crazy demon thing. Sam was sleeping and her stomach grew because of the baby but when she woke up her stomach was back to normal. Zach and Sam saw some weird cult dude outside looking up at their window. The taxi driver cult dude was in the church and did some weird voodoo Harry Potter spell to make the Preist have a stroke.When Sam dies and has her demon baby, guess who's there!! Oh yeah it's the cult dudes here coming to take her baby. The taxi driver and his cult friends take he baby and leave. Sam dies when she's having the baby because it's a demon and the weird thing is. SHE DIDNT HAVE HER BABY AT THE HOSPITAL. She literally layed on her dirty ground and had her baby and died so those cult dudes broke in and STOLE THE BABY. I think the police arrived and saw Sams dead body and I think they though that Zach murdered Sam because he was the only one left so he has to go to the police station and talk to them about it.So now you know the story choose if you want to watch it.

Come January, 'Devil's Due' arrives to buck that trend, in the worst possible way.Audiences are undoubtedly now tired of all of the following; found footage, found footage that must be justified by lazy dialogue explaining why a character must hold the camera at all times, evil cults, and cheap scares. 'Devil's Due' is abundant in all of the above. It's a film with a disturbing premise that amounts to nothing more than a revision of anything utilised in horror over the last year, where it was utilised much better. Among its few saving graces is a refreshing switch in camera technique to service the story better, which comes a relief when characters continue to mindlessly film the most terrifyingly inconvenient situations in which to hold a video device.Like one of the lesser instalments in the 'Paranormal Activity' series, the film descends into an all too familiar period of 'great' intensity before ignoring all loose ends as it closes with an obvious cliff hanger.'Devil's Due' is inspired, for sure, but only by a number of pictures that set the bar (low). It's mildly compelling, and suitably short, and therefore remains a slightly acceptable manner in which to waste an hour and twenty minutes.",

Maybe a cool scene or two, but nothing all that impressive. Anyways, the whole found footage thing is getting old. It turns into a sense of why is this person holding this camera at this particular place and time. Sometimes it's who is holding the camera and why? There was a point where you could see the main actors two empty hands, but he was supposed to be holding the camera. A little sloppy there. Movies today can be just as effective without the found footage crap.The movie itself was kind of typical of a possession horror movie. Girl gets impregnated by an evil force, you know what happens next. No surprise. Why would you even go to the Dominican Republic on a honey moon? I guess everyone has their own thing.",

It's almost surprising, if it's not so sad that the producer or director once thought imitation of other horror films could be a substitute for real tension. Furthermore, displaying it in found footage style doesn't add anything, let alone mask the unoriginality.\n\nThe lackluster story is about two couples who happily spend their honeymoon, but in the end meet with dubious characters. After some bizarre forgettable occurrence, the bride is pregnant. No, this is not Hangover, although it would've been better. What follows is a mix between pregnancy scare and overused gimmicks. The theme has been used before, but this is acceptable, many movies use already proven formula and produces new material. Devil's Due, on the other hand, cobbles together pieces of other works in hope of anyone who hasn't watched horror movies in years will find it amusing.\n\nIts use of found footage mechanic further confuses the plot, because some of the scenes shouldn't have been captured in the first place. It uses all security cameras which are in vicinity of the story, it's not only one vlogger type, yet it still feels unauthentic and staged to capture certain scenes. It probably would've been slightly better if it's done in simple third person view. \n\nThere's not much excellence in acting either, the usual scream and frantic gaze. As an intimate experience of maternity, the movie could've depicted more personal issue. The scares aren't much better, often showing people in trance or shouting randomly. Every part of the movie is dull, any horror it has is watered down because it's near exact replica of others.\n\nGranted, those who had or having the delicate 9 months marathon could appreciate it better, but why would they watch this movie, why would anyone for that matter?",

It is so much worse than you could possibly imagine.\n\nWhen a film is terrible, truly Devil's Due is one of the worst films I've ever seen, it is hard to choose a starting point for a review. While trying to formulate a procedural direction you think of each infuriatingly poor decision on behalf of the writer and director and how wasting 89 minutes of your life was easily avoidable.\n\nA recently wed couple, Sam and Zach, embark on their honeymoon to a tropical destination. On their final night they go off the beaten path to an underground party at the behest of their taxi-driver. Sam discovers she is pregnant almost immediately after they return home. The rest of Devil's Due is about the alleged terrifying events unfolding around - and inside of - her.\n\nAs a couple, Allison Miller and Zach Gilford are far from distinct, compelling or even believable. Allison Miller's Sam is cute but about as basic as you can get - case and point: she hugs a juicer she receives as a wedding present. Gilford painfully overacts as the cheesy newly-hubbied other half. He intrusively catalogs their whole life together, obnoxiously toting his video camera everywhere he goes, making sure it is always in focus, perfectly framed and well lit even when his wife is doubled over in pain.\n\nDevil's Due is touted as a 'found footage' film. If one more cheesy camcorder style horror movie is released I am going to dig up and then punch Jerome Lemelson's corpse in the face. Apparently a handheld camera is not enough for our character Zach in Devil's Due. In addition, he is a creepy pervert with hidden cameras throughout the house to capture life as well. Yet it also utilizes security footage at a grocery store, secret cameras in every room of the couple's house and police interrogation footage. This lack of direction must be what happens when there are two directors, Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, working on one film.\n\nAll the exasperatingly frustrating facepalm-worthy horror clich\u00e9s are included in Devil's Due thanks to inexperienced screenwriter Lindsay Devlin. The plot is not new, not interesting and insanely moronic. Immediately, the main characters obliviously follow a stranger down a dark alley while in a foreign country to go to an unmarked party. Later, all the footage husband Zach painstakingly films is never actually reviewed, let alone uploaded to a hard-drive, so one must assume he buys his SD cards in bulk. Further, the transformation within Sam is purely incidental as the demonic fetus becomes stronger in her womb. In the meantime there is enough stagnating filler scenes to grind the film to an immediate halt.\n\nThere is nothing redeemable about Devil's Due and the fact it was even released, let alone in mainstream movie theaters, is baffling.",

If it has a fault, it's that it moves a bit too slow too frequently, often mistaking the building of tension for just dull and slow moving sequences without any tension.  More often than not though, the deliberate pace works, building up a creepy mood and a feeling of genuine uncertainty.  You never really know when things are going to hit the fan, and then when they do, they hit hard.  The film actually managed to illicit a scream from me on a few occasions, and the unsettling mood escalates to levels that are downright disturbing by the end.  The found footage approach is done a bit differently (not so much \"found\" footage, more that real-life cameras are the lens we view the movie through), and the performances feel genuine and realistic.  It would have benefited from some cuts to the slower scenes, but overall it's a truly great horror flick..",

I do like that the movie hold off the scares, and builds the relationship between Samantha and Zach so I can care and be worried about them whenever something happens. When the scares come, there is a decent amount that scared me, though I wish there could've been more of them. There were smart moments when the main character actually puts the camera down when trying to help his wife instead of just still recording her. The best part was the ending where everything goes crazy with lots of stuff in their house goes everywhere just like the director's segment with V/H/S. When it does that, it didn't feel the same to me which I like.",

It would be one thing if it did that once, but it is constantly doing that throughout, teasing you with what you want to see as a horror fan, but never actually delivering.  All of the main characters dismiss these strange happenings, and fall just short of audibly saying \"Huh... that's weird...  So anyway...\"  Sure, in better hands you could use these in between scenes to build character, but it isn't written well enough for you to develop a connection with these people or cause you to even remotely care, really.

            "content": "Devil's Due, otherwise known as The Most Realistic Film about Pregnancy Ever.  That's the best thing about this movie, that it helped me come up with a very stupid joke.  I don't wanna say that this is scraping the bottom of the barrel as far as found footage horror films go, I'm sure there's some really low-budget, cheaply produced crap that's far worse than this.  But, as far as \"mainstream\" found footage films go, this is only a slight step above The Devil Inside.  Perhaps that's a bit harsh because, at first, glance this film doesn't seem so bad.  There is some stupidity like the antichrist protecting the unborn baby when it sense it's in danger.  If that's the case then why not just get rid of the Zach, Sam's husband, and avoid him putting up a resistance to the coming of one of the antichrist's children.  Don't let him ever find out about the cult that is facilitating this process.  Turns out the antichrist isn't as smart as he has led people to believe.  That's the stupidest thing that comes to mind.  The problem is that the film is absolutely content in mimicking found footage films that came before it, that were better.  The one that comes to mind the most is the most obvious one.  That being Paranormal Activity, the first one at least.  There's something about how the film is structured and edited that just screams PA.  This film, in its climax, is a little more violent and bloody than PA ever will be, but it's clear this film was patterned after that series and its success.  I think it's fine if you take inspiration from a very successful series, or even borrow elements from it.  How many vampire films did we get right after Twilight came out?  It's gonna happen when something is popular, it's inevitable.  In the case of Twilight, though, many of the vampire related films that came after it were considerably better.  Found footage horror films are far more misses than they are hits, so it's increasingly difficult to find one that is as good, or better, than the first PA film.  The problem comes when the PA series itself is as creatively stagnant as it is that you want to see others try something different instead of repeating the same stuff you've seen a thousand times before.  And that is the main flaw of this.  It's content in repeating what others have done instead of blazing its own path.  Or even if you're gonna shamelessly ripoff another series, then at least put a little more effort into your scares, something this film is completely devoid of.  There's some jump scares here and there, but that's just laziness to me.  Here's the thing that made the first PA so great, they knew how to build tension.  I've said this a MILLION times since then, but the more that film went on the more uneasy things got.  You were dreading what was going to happen because you knew it was gonna be worse than what you had already seen.  That's something SO few horror movies get, that it's revealing another side of Paranormal Activity's intelligence, the first one of course, and not the terrible sequels.  This film doesn't get the tension and the suspense right at all.  For the most part this really is just a boring movie to watch, there's no suspense.  And that is what is needed most in this type of film where you're saving everything for the last 15 minutes.  I will say that the climax of the film was decent and suitably bloody, but it doesn't really do much other than remind you of how much better this could've been if more effort was put into it.  Perhaps the filmmakers did put in an effort, I don't mean to disregard their work...but it's clear that their best wasn't good enough.  And these guys did a pretty good segment in the first VHS.  Nothing extraordinary, but enough to make you think they'd do something better than this for their first full-length feature film.  Just skip this movie altogether and rent REC.  Now that's a fabulous found footage horror film.  It doesn't get any better than that.",

            "content": "Ah, fuck. Here we go again. Yet another found footage horror film, and worst of all, another demon possession-themed one. How many of these kinds of films do we need, anyway? Well, at least it's not as bad as say, The Devil Inside, Seventh Moon, or Paranormal Activity 4, but it's still a piece of shit and yet another slap in the face to demon possession horror films and found footage films.\n\nThe McCalls are a newly and happily married couple. During their honeymoon in the Dominican Republic, they explore the sights, party, and do all sorts of other things like any newly married couple would do on such a special occasion. During their last night in the country, a cab driver convinces them to go to a club with him, and during the intense partying, they black out and remember nothing of the rest of that night.\n\nShortly after they come home, it turns out that Samantha is pregnant despite all their attempts at birth control. Despite this unexpected event, the couple is happy to be expecting their baby and begin making the arrangements as any responsible parent would.\n\nBut, as time goes by, Samantha begins to change, and not in ways a pregnancy would normally change a woman, or her symptoms are far more severe than what most other women would experience. Her mood can suddenly go from happy to furious (Like when a car accidentally backs up into her and she smashes multiple windows in her rage), she develops cravings for raw meat despite being a vegetarian, seems to develop telekinetic powers (Which at one point she uses to murder a group of annoying teenagers), and also seems to get super strength as well from this baby inside of her.\n\nNow, her husband (Who is obsessed with holding a damn camera for every fucking event in this film), Zach must figure out what is really going on with his wife and their baby before it's too late for him, for her, and even other people. Slowly he begins to unravel the horrible truth of what really happened that night and what is really growing inside of his wife, all while other people are injured or killed in the process of the horror.\n\nWhat really kills Devil's Due is how damn boring it is. This mostly has to do with the fact that the film seems awfully content to be a generic brand of horror as it has absolutely no ideas of its own. If you've seen Rosemary's Baby along with virtually every other demon possession film, and pretty much any found footage film, you already know exactly what is going to happen and you will not give one flying fuck as any of it happens because any sense of tension, terror, or suspense is automatically negated.\n\nI would be hesitant to call this an assembly line horror film, but instead it feels like a bad bargain bin version of a generic assembly line horror film, making the experience all that much more miserable to sit through.\n\nIt also doesn't help that the direction is terrible. Even by the standards of found footage films which require a lot of camera shaking, dropping the camera, and various other things which can get annoying at times, Devil's Due has absolutely horrendous camera work, which only helped to ruin any sense of atmosphere as well as it became difficult to see much of what was happening because the dipshit characters either filmed at bad angles or dropped the fucking camera constantly. When I have to constantly crane my head to follow the camera to see where the hell it's going, something is desperately wrong.\n\nWhile I felt that the actors tried their best, they could do very little with their roles thanks to the horrendously generic and derivative script which feels like a horrid combo of a bargain version of Rosemary's Baby (For those who thought that film was too slow and needed an abundance of jump scares) combined with the film-making quality of the atrocious Paranormal Activity 2 & 4. I never cared about any of these characters and due to the generic nature of this film, it becomes abundantly clear very early on who is going to live and die and what happens. See? Can you blame the actors for not giving good  performances? What the fuck were they supposed to do with this shit?\n\nAlso, the film is certainly not scary and comes with all the annoying tropes of modern horror films. There's a lot of jump scares, stealing from much better sources to coat tail their successes, dumb characters with little to no development, tired ideas, and more. I was never scared, never creeped out, nor did I even feel any sense of dread or menace from the atmosphere because the atmosphere and tone are very lousy in quality. There's nothing here to satisfy most horror fans, and will only serve to please people who find jump scares frightening.\n\nDevil's Due is yet another lousy found footage film and another lousy demon possession film that has no creativity, energy, scares, good acting, quality storytelling, good music, or really much of anything going for it. Unless you're really hard up for a bargain version of Rosemary's Baby for people who don't have the patience or taste to appreciate that film, you won't find a damn thing in this film. Avoid it at all costs, as it cannot even be salvaged as trashy entertainment.",

Yeah, I still don't believe it, but it does so much right where other movies that look like this have failed.\n\nHere's the main reason why it's a good movie: the newlyweds (Allison Miller and Zach Gilford) are actually likable people. I don't really see them \"found footage acting;\" I see them as two happy people starting a life together. They aren't \"douchey guy\" and \"dumb girl who gets possessed,\" like every other movie out there in this genre. We take likable characters for granted in horror.\n\nAnd it's not exactly a found footage movie. It pulls a Chronicle (great handheld-camera based movie) and mixes security footage with consumer cameras. There isn't an \"editor\" who put all these clips together; you're just watching a story unfold in front of you.\n\nI think the directors (Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett) know that these found footage movies aren't scary or convincing at all. They were with The Blair Witch Project, when everyone thought that was real, but that novelty is gone. So they set out to make a dramatic thriller with horror elements. Most of the time, I don't feel like I'm watching a horror movie, and that's great.\n\nIt's certainly not perfect. The resolution is crappy due to a ton of convenient things that would have to happen for the cult and extremely incompetent police work. The climax is a little reminiscent of every found footage movie. And like I said, it's a dramatic thriller more than horror, so you might not be scared as much as you want to be.\n\nBut I hope people don't mistake this one for complete crap, like the very closely titled The Devil Inside. Devil's Due stands out among the sea of sludge and it's worth at least a rental.",

            "content": "It's extremely difficult to make a solid horror film nowadays. The movie follows Zach and Samantha McCall as two newlyweds heading to Santa Domingo for their honeymoon. Of course the over sensitive husband wants to document their entire lives as they begin their journey on becoming a family. They are given a gift of an adventure cam so they can continue to document things without the need of holding a handheld camera. After what seems to be a wonderful vacation the two are approached by a taxi driver who leads them for one last hurrah to celebrate their trip. You find out this becomes the biggest mistake of their young marriage. When they return home Samantha finds out she's pregnant and things to start to become a little strange for the two. Not only is the pregnancy itself of concern but Zach feels as if his new family may also be being watched. You soon find out that Samantha's behavior has changed drastically and she has become the vessel to a child no woman would want to carry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCinema (and certainly the horror genre) has become over saturated with the cheaper film making process known as 'found-footage. It's a struggle to see how the increasingly convenient camerawork that continues to capture poorly shot scenes and set pieces can still be taken seriously. Scenes that frame a conversation that moves the plot forward with an eye rolling revelation are the most bothersome, especially when wondering, \"Why would you be recording this?\" Then there is the irritating money shots while characters fight for their lives. Of course we need to see it, but again, in the back of your mind you're always thinking, Surely it'd be easier to survive or escape if they'd only throw the camera. While its first half promises to take an alternative route to what we've become accustomed to in this sub genre while sticking to the rule of an excited, expectant couple wanting treasured memories, it's not long before those aforementioned questions begin to rear their ugly head. It descends into a muddled supernatural mess by throwing in CCTV from supermarkets, car parks, strangers' camcorders, police interviews, and most bizarrely the mysterious cult keeping tabs on the couple to assure another little Satan is delivered safely. Conducive in its linear approach to a narrative we can simply understand, it fails in its delivery significantly. Leaving you to pose another question. Whose supposed to be putting all this crap together???\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two leads give strong, committed performances, Miller in particular. They are the film's only saving grace, but, when the script progresses from their obvious love of one another to wanting to secure jump scares alongside special effects, Devil's Due loses that impressive emotional impact initially built up early on. None more so than, when at a family gathering, the camera is unbelievably given to children running around the house playing hide and seek. From then on, it no longer feels interested in building up to a terrifying tale. This is, or rather supposedly is, a horror film. It becomes increasingly obvious it's more concerned in impressing with stunt work or set pieces, with the pyrotechnic-filled conclusion sign posted well in advance. We're then treated to an unnecessary post credit sequence offering something glaringly obvious. Devil's Due, like most found footage entries, falls flat in its cringe worthy execution and refuses to stand out from the crowd. The only thing it does deliver, aside from disappointment, is predictability.",

The Hollywood movie studios should be embarassed to keep peddling these retreads.\r\n\r\nZach (Zack Gilford) and Samantha McCall (Allison Miller) head off to the Dominican Republic for their honeymoon.  Zach brings his video camera, intent on capturing every moment of their life together.  They party it up and awake confused after a night of strange happenings.\r\n\r\nWhen they get home, Samantha learns that she is pregnant.  Very quickly the pregnancy turns eerie.  The farther along she gets, the more her mood changes, plus strange people have started watching the house.\r\n\r\nVery few scares.  The worst part for me was that the handheld camera shook all the time, making the film almost unwatchable.  At times I could barely see what was happening.  Overall that might have been a good thing.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v48/Zeppo1/DevilsDue_zps46c52faf.jpg[/IMG]",

With Devil's Due you have a generic film that simply isn't scary and it fails to really grab your attention in terms of horror elements. The found footage genre is overdone, and with a film like this one, it's clear that there is nothing left to offer the genre. The cast are good, but it'[s a shame that the film's material doesn't gel together, and in turn becomes forgettable. Devil's Due is never scary; in fact it's silly in the way it tries to do so. You know exactly how this film will turn out. The scares are nonexistent, and the film's story just suffers from a lack of genuine thrills and good writing. If you want a great horror film, you won't find it here. This is a predictable affair, one that we've seen in far better found footage horror films. Devil's Due has the misfortune of coming too late in the game, and the result is a train wreck of a film, and it's unfortunate that the story is bad because the cast are quite good here. I think it's a shame that the film's story goes nowhere, and it never realizes its potential of being a good horror film. Maybe if they wouldn't have made a found footage style movie, and reworked the film then maybe this film would have been much better. However, it's just boring, uninteresting and it never is a worthwhile film to watch. Personally, I'm surprised that I was able to finish this, as the film lacked in originality and truly memorable, terrifying elements, which makes the horror genre so good.",

So here we go.......my NICE review of the January horror extravaganza known as 'Devil's Due'.\nWell........I didn't get around to seeing this movie in January.  I was too busy watching films that deserved my attention compared to this..................valiant attempt at a January horror masterpiece.  So I was fortunate to have a copy of this left for me on my kitchen counter via redbox.  I'll be sure to leave that person an absolutely wonderful thank you card for this...............gracious gesture.\nAnyways, the plot is very..........good.  I mean, someone being possessed is an idea that certainly isn't going out of style.  It's been months since I've seen one, and let's just say that I've been dying for a possession thriller.  \nYou want scares.........good.........because this movie has a butt load of them.  Are they my kind of scares?  No........but that doesn't mean they aren't awesome.  Say you have a 3 year old who accidentally walks in on this........my GOD.  That would terrify the hell out of them.  So make sure you tuck your kids in so they don't interrupt this....................fright fest.\nSo uh..............oh yeah..........stuff flies around and hits people!  I've never seen a possession movie do that before!  Granted I've only seen about 10 movies in my life, so there may be one out there that I don't know about.  But wowzers, was it ever cool.\nSo that uh..........that about does it.  I didn't see any plot holes, cheap acting, void of entertainment, typical cliches, predictable elements, or lazy writing.  So if I were to rate this movie..........I would give it.............a fair score.  Because that's the nice thing to do",

            "content": "It would be all too easy to dismiss Devil's Due as a monumentally stupid piece of work, devoid of any artistic merit or redeeming qualities whatsoever. So I will. In short, directors (yes, plural) Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett have taken the story of Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby, removed any semblance of tension, suspense, style or craft, and replaced them with clumsy plotting and a clunky found-footage device that, at this point, is beyond clich\u00e9.\n\nSamantha (Allison Miller) and Zach (Zach Gifford, not the James Spader guy from Revenge) are a couple of middle class twits who, in spite of jointly possessing the intellectual capacity of the common jellyfish, enjoy a privileged lifestyle that would shame a Russian oligarch. They live in a palatial home decorated by Laura Ashley, with a dog that's obviously the brains of the outfit. Zach has some non-descript high-powered job that allows him ample free time to assemble flat-pack furniture and work his way up from slip-ons to lace-ups, and Samantha is in college studying something-or-other ('cos people who go to college are smart, right?). An over-inflated sense of entitlement compels these hateful imbeciles to compulsively record every vacuous utterance and bodily function that emanates from their gurgling blowholes, but is hidden under the excuse of starting a \"family history\" (nicely shoehorned, found-footage device).\n\nOn the last night of their honeymoon in the Dominican Republic, the newlyweds lose their way back to their hotel, although this pair of mouth-breathing simpletons would probably get lost on the way to their en-suite. Anyway, they accept an offer from a very dodgy complete stranger and willingly follow him off to the dodgiest slum in Santo Domingo, where Simple Samantha is drugged and impregnated by a satanic cult (or something like that). When they awake in their hotel the next morning with no memory of what happened or how they got there, Simple Zack decides to completely ignore the video camera that's been recording everything that's happened to these two morons since the start of the movie, and instead puts the whole affair down to a hangover.\n\nOn returning to Casa del Simpleton, they are overjoyed to discover that Simple Samantha is with child. When her behaviour becomes increasingly erratic - for example, scarfing fistfuls of raw mince straight from the freezer section of the local supermarket, or hunting, killing and devouring a pack of wild deer - Simple Zach chalks this behaviour down to hormones (women, eh?). Had her index finger started speaking Bible verse in a demonic voice, this fool would probably have shrugged and thought, \"That's awesome, dude.\"\n\nDevil's Due is a dumb, dumb movie that doesn't work on any level. It has the aesthetic and appeal of a bad student film. The found-footage gimmick necessitates a constant \"Oh, you're miscarrying? Hold on, let me just grab the camera,\" that turns out to be unintentionally hilarious. It is unlikely to satisfy the most undiscerning fan of horror. The gore isn't that gory, and the bizarre choice of using an annoying \"interference glitch\" means that the film's few genuine shocks are well-signposted. During the film's climax, I was more distressed by the destruction of the delightful furnishings and fittings than by whatever grisly punishment was being meted out either of our two idiotic protagonists. Nevertheless, it was probably very cheap to make and will sell enough tickets at the box office to justify a sequel. And that is really scary.",

Why don't you leave that woman alone the first time she magically throws you across the room?\n\n(See more of this review at: http://dubandamovie.blogspot.com/)",

I was in the cinema, on my own.I don't mean I went on my own, I mean I was the only one in the cinema, in a large dark room, watching a horror film on a 30 foot screen, on my own. I was prepared to be the most scared I have ever been. Unfortunately, Devil's Due wasn't quite up to it. I will admit that I was frequently tense, but the film really had very little to offer in terms of genuine scares. It had a few nice ideas, and the main couple in the film are both very likeable, but there were simply too many clich\u00e9s for there to be any real surprises.",

Total shit.\n\nDD is one of the millions of low budget, poorly thought out and ultimately failed horror movies. I wonder if anyone reads the scripts or if the expectation is that even if you make this garbage, just making it to the big screen will make you famous/rich or at least controversial. \n\nFrankly DD is so bad that the poor actors that made it will probably struggle to get work at McDonalds. I mean, a high school play would have been better than this piece of garbage. It wasn't even unintentionally funny, usually the salvation for many horror movies. \n\nFrankly this was such a waste of my time I wonder what I was thinking when I went to see it.\n\nWatch this instead.

It was nice to find myself actively rooting for these two to make it out of the predicament ok. That said, the two leads really are all this film has going for it. It follows every possession film cliche in very obvious ways (at least it doesn't rely as heavily on jump scares as you think it would, although the film is never ever scary). The only good parts in this film are the deer scene and the ending. It also doesn't help that the film is kind of scattershot(however it doesn't rely on shaky cam all that much, so that's nice). I do love Radio Silence (the name of the group that put this film together), and they clearly have some talent but Devil's Due, while not particularly awful, isn't really any good either. It's just ok. I will say it's worth a rental, maybe a purchase on DVD if you are at all interested, but there is no reason to run to theaters to see this one.",

            "content": "If there's one bit of knowledge I could scream at every single person in the world this time of year it's this: NEVER GO SEE MOVIES IN JANUARY. It's a dumping ground off all the movies the studios didn't want to release in the previous year or have no better time to release the rest of the year. Looking at the chart on Rotten Tomatoes there are only one or two movies released this year that have a score above 50%. So far this year we've had the Asylum-wannabe Legend of Hercules, the horrendously unfunny Ride Along, the hispanic bore-fest Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones, the Godfrey-Hoed 47 Ronin, and coming up we have the doomed I, Frankenstein (which I'm sure will follow in the footsteps of Dylan Dog and Priest as being a not too bad, but horribly cliched movie that ruins a great premise) and That Awkward Moment where men act like assholes... like every other comedy these days. So Devil's Due already has that going against it, let alone the fact it's yet another found-footage film and that it seems to be a remake of Rosemary's Baby. However, does it manage to scrap it's way to excellence despite these handicaps? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. No.\n\nDevil's Due is the story of a newlywed couple who finds themselves expecting after the wife is impregnated on their honeymoon by a mysterious cult. The next 9 months quickly become a nightmare as they're plagued by the wife's unusual violent outbursts, telekinesis and lust for blood. The conspiracy deepens as they seem to be followed everywhere and people in their lives seem to disappear, leaving the husband on a desperate search for answers (filming all the way).\n\nFound-footage/Mockumentary is a style of filmmaking that has exploded into the horror community and very slightly into other genres, mainly through the independent movement. Found-footage is absolutely dirt-cheap to make and they turn regular horror movie profits, which is why studios love them so much. Many horror fans despise them for being slow and anti-climatic with terrible acting and effects. My argument back is that most horror movies have terrible acting, a good chunk have shitty effects, and for the first 50 years of horror the movies were slow-paced. I actually like a few found-footage movies, like Blair Witch, Paranormal Activity, and to a certain extent Paranormal Activity 2. While I had great experiences viewing them for the first time they all have no re-watch value. Chronicle, which isn't horror, but still a film I thoroughly enjoyed, is probably the only one I would go back and watch again for the purposes of actual enjoyment. Mockumentary's a film-style I can respect if a) it's just a style and their are no in-story cameras (Chernobyl Diaries) or b) if they have cameras in the story and use them properly (Blair Witch, Paranormal Activity). Devil's Due doesn't fall into either of these, with a myriad of inaccuracies that on their own are the nitpicks of a film nerd, but combined create a lack of believability in the story (which is the whole point of found footage). There are tons of camera angles that shouldn't exist, but do because the director said so. The cameras all look the same with maybe a filter thrown on, despite being radically different models. The husband even mentions that the tape is gone despite the fact the movie is clearly shot in digital HD. If you're going to be found footage, make the effort to be found footage. There was no reason this movie needed to be found footage other then the fact that the writers couldn't come up with anything original and scary enough for the studio to put more money into it.\n\nNow since we can pretty much ignore acting or effects and just assume they're shit, lets go to the scares shall we. The most important part of a found footage movie are the payoffs of all the build-up and suspense the relatively slow paced rest of the movie creates. At least thats how it's supposed to work. Devil's Due is slow paced alright, letting us watch the marriage and honeymoon of these fairly boring protagonists. I understand the theoretical purpose behind this as it's intended to get us invested in these characters, however it's completely ineffective as the only defining characteristic the guy has is that he likes to film stuff and while the girl actually has character and is interesting to watch, it doesn't matter since she gets possessed and becomes the antagonist. Let's contrast this with Rosemary's Baby, where Rosemary is in a similar situation, except she has her faculties the whole time and it isn't until the end where she loses it. The mother here goes bat-shit insane half-way through the movie and we might as well be watching The Exorcist from that point. Well except for the fact that the Exorcist was scary, and this movie is inept at building any tension or suspense to make it's frequent jump-scares anything more then cheap tricks. The film relies almost entirely on jump-scares and the rest of it's fear tactics involve breaking a window, eating raw meat and a hilarious scene where a bunch of kids get thrown around like a scene out of Chronicle. It's hard to describe why there appears to be no threat here and yet there is in movies like Paranormal Activity and Blair Witch, but rest assured you have nothing to be scared of when watching this film except for when you look at your watch and discover just how little time has passed.\n\nA colleague of mine who I frequently disagree with on movies stated that this movie is nowhere near as bad people make it out to be and that it's actually worth a trip to the theatre if you've run out of December releases to see. While I think it's true that this movie is not the worst thing ever made and that it doesn't deserve the 17% rating on Rotten Tomatoes it has right now, it's nowhere near worth the current $12 movie ticket price. If anything this movie is just blatantly mediocre and with a different director it could have actually been an interesting take on the devil baby storyline. As it stands though, there are plenty of movies far more worth your time if you're interested in these themes, but if you really are curious about this movie then just wait until it hits Redbox. If you do want a devil pregnancy story then I recommend the slow but effective Rosemary's Baby or even the first season of American Horror Story and if you want a found footage movie then check out if you haven't already The Blair Witch Project, the oft forgotten The Last Broadcast, and if you don't want horror then Chronicle. Before I resign my keyboard for this review I would just like to emphasize that you should really hold off going to the theatre until February as odds are your viewing experience will be less then pleasant. Thats not to say all January releases suck but there certainly is never an Oscar winner among them.",

            "content": "January 17, 2013\r\n \r\nEver since \"The Blair Witch Project,\" the \"found footage\" style of filmmaking has become inextricably linked with horror movies. It's with good reason, I suppose, since the purpose behind the technique is to lend the film a raw, realistic atmosphere, and when something feels more realistic, it often feels scarier.\r\n \r\nBut after so many examples, from the interminable \"Paranormal Activity\" series to \"The Last Exorcism,\" the method simply can't have the same impact it once did, and in the case of \"Devil's Due,\" I'm not convinced this manner of presentation was even necessary. Then again, the entire production doesn't seem necessary.\r\n \r\nA movie like this practically embodies the word \"derivative.\" It borrows so heavily from other movies, including the ones I already mentioned, that it almost seems deliberate. There's not one fresh or original bone in its body. And yet, it's not a train wreck, or even badly made. Perhaps at a different time across the cinematic landscape--say, 15 years ago--\"Devil's Due\" might have been more effective and only comparable to the superior \"Rosemary's Baby,\" at least as far as demonic possession movies go. But now, in 2014, there's nothing about it that makes it stand out and we quickly grow bored with it.\r\n \r\nThe story follows a young newlywed couple, Zach (Zach Guilford) and Samantha McCall (Allison Miller), during a horrific experience following their honeymoon to Santo Domingo. On their last night there, they get lost and are picked up by a seemingly friendly cab driver (Roger Payano), who takes them to a secret underground party. Because Zach likes to record everything with his video camera (here's where the found footage comes into play), we witness everything candidly, even if he and Sam don't. After they get drunk and pass out, they're taken to an ominous stone chamber, where religious signs and symbols grace the walls and floor. (It's not clear who was recording them or holding the camera at this point, but never mind.)\r\n \r\nCut to Zach and Sam's hotel room the next day and they both have massive hangovers and aren't exactly sure how they got back. Nevertheless, they return to their quaint suburban home and Sam discovers she's pregnant, despite her claiming to \"take the the pill religiously.\"\r\n \r\nFrom here on out, strange and creepy things start to happen. Based on the genre, and because we're smart enough to know way in advance where the plot is going, we can pretty much check these occurrences off one by one: Sam develops bruises on her body but is unable to explain where they came from; an ultra sound of the baby causes technical glitches on the monitor; Sam, who's a vegetarian, impulsively tears open a package of ground beef at the grocery store and begins to eat it like a rabid animal; and she experiences sudden nosebleeds and spikes in strength that give her the power to break windows and throw people across the room. There's also the issue of the creepy guys who watch her from across the street.\r\n \r\nGiven the movie's title, not to mention the Bible verse that opens the film--\"Children, it is the last hour, and as you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come...\" 1 John: 2:18--it's pretty obvious what, or who, is gestating inside of Sam. But does the movie put any kind of original twist on this premise or offer any new insight into the underlying idea? Not really. It's all standard horror fodder and the movie dishes out all the usual conventions, such as the family dog suspecting something is awry (somehow dogs are always the first to know); or a priest (Sam Anderson) sensing an evil presence and bleeding out uncontrollably. You get the idea.\r\n \r\nIf you've seen any demonic possession movie before, \"Devil's Due\" will not seem like anything new. But unlike some of its brethren, it's not particularly scary, thrilling or really all that interesting. For its mere 89-minute runtime, we patiently wait for something gripping or frightening to happen, but because every scene feels like a retread, it never does. The plot rolls out exactly as we expect it to, which makes it something we bear instead of enjoy.\r\n \r\nI mentioned the movie isn't badly made, and it isn't. On a technical level, it's competently shot and put together, even though we question the narrative purpose behind the found footage approach. Aesthetically, I know what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish, but how did they want us to interpret it from the world of the movie? Did they want us to think someone took all the footage from the various cameras that recorded the events and spliced it together?\r\n \r\nIn any case, we're probably not supposed to think too hard about it and just accept the movie's presentation as a device to make it more tense and suspenseful. And I'd be willing to do that had it actually been tense or suspenseful, but it's mostly bland and no new ingredients have been added to the mix to spice up this particular horror sub-genre.\r\n \r\nIt feels wrong to write this, but it's sometimes a shame movies like \"Devil's Due\" are so cheap to make (it reportedly cost $7 million to produce), because if they had higher budgets, perhaps the studio and filmmakers would make more of an effort to do something different with them to better ensure audiences got the best bang for their buck. As it is, \"Devil's Due\" barely give us a tap, let alone a bang.",

            "content": "Demonic possession has been the most popular theme in the horror genre as of late.  Paranormal Activity, The Conjuring, Insidious, and the list goes in, have all been the talk of the cinema at one point or another.  Devil's Due takes a unique approach by neglecting to incorporate ghosts into the mix unlike its brothers and sisters.\n\nIf you have ever heard of, or viewed Rosemary's Baby, it will ring bells and reveal where this take on possession received its inspiration.  Is the former a bad place to learn from?  Not at all.  The problem lies in the fact that the 1968 version is a far superior film. And not just a far walk home from work.  I'm talking as far as Canada is from Japan.  Walking distance, no plane.\n\nThis found footage take on Rosemary's Baby did have some things going for it at the start, but it all went away as the film progressed.\n\nA happy pair of newlyweds, Zach McCall (Zach Gilford) and Samantha McCall (Allison Miller) go to Dominican Republic for a classic honeymoon get-away.  Everything looks wild and exciting, until a strange cab driver convinces them to try out a club nearby. Zach persuades Samantha that one more drink will be fun.\n\nThe two end up drugged, and forget everything that happened. Viewers witness the camera picking up blurred images of creepy Satanic appearing rituals, as the couple are fast asleep.  Once back home, Samantha reveals that she is pregnant.\n\nJoy surrounds the household, until the baby waiting process starts becoming very unusual for Samantha. Nose bleeds, and knock off your feet pains can occur at times for any future mother, but developing a carnivorous appetite,  violent aggression, and telepathic powers are certainly not normal.\n\nDevil's Due did a good job with casting.  The two leads are easy to like, and both know how to act.  Zach is a television star, known mostly for his role in Friday Night Lights.  He has appeared in films such as The Last Stand, Crazy Kind of Love, and the upcoming The Purge 2.  Miller is also mostly known from television, appearing in Terra Nova and Kings.\n\nBoth have potential to be in bigger and better movies, as they do have the talent.  As good as it is to have focus on the characters, I cannot say I was entertained by how long it went on.\n\nIt was simply happy family chatter, that added nothing to the plot. Zach is a cocky, funny guy who means well, while Samantha is a more laid back, sweet woman who lost her parents and grew up in foster care.  They love each-other very much.\n\nI described the first forty minutes of character development in a ten second read.  Zach demonstrates bravery and determination to save his wife, but that is expressed later on in the plot.\n\nIt never built up anything particularly special, minus the usual you would expect from this sort of film.  People being dragged and tossed by an unseen force is just not amusing anymore.  It has been done in Paranormal Activity and Quarantine already, no need for more of that.\n\nNothing was scary or creepy.  The jump scares, with the exception of one that caught me off-guard, were terribly obvious, and poorly concealed.  A scene or two did have a cool, or humorous effect, standing out as more memorable than the rest.\n\nOther than painfully phony coughs by the priest (Sam Anderson), the happenings in the church led to an entertaining few minutes. When Samantha is walking through the grocery store, make sure to keep your eyes on the bystanders.  Their reactions made me smile.\n\nThe two parts I mentioned above were far more interesting than the climax and final few moments. Predictable, boring, and done before countless times.  Not to mention the severe usage of plot holes in order to make this film progress conveniently.\n\nWithout spoiling anything important, here is an example. A surprise party is thrown for Samantha, but she feels tired and goes upstairs.  A child wonders up later, looking for the dog I believe. She wonders into a room, and gets scared off by a creepy, possessed looking Samantha.\n\nDoes she go downstairs and make mention of this?  Did no one else hear the loud pitched screams of terror?  Is Zach going to question Samantha about it in the morning? Nope, explaining things would be difficult I suppose.  A young child would surely run down crying, and make a big deal about it.  The plot holes revealed in the last scene of a interrogation room are much worse.  Asking yourself, \"How?\", can be expected.\n\nFound footage is far from my favorite type of film. Thankfully, Devil's Due managed to do one thing right. Instead of Zach carrying a camera around constantly, the film makes use of security camera's when in public, and cameras are placed around the house.  It is clever, and makes more sense when you think about it.\n\nThe bottom line is that this film brings nothing new to the table, or anything worth watching again.  The majority of the acting is strong, but the characters themselves are not memorable or special. Scares may come for people who have never watched a horror film, or jump at their own shadow, but the experienced fans will walk out disappointed.\n\nIf this is next on your list, I would advise waiting until it comes out on Netlix.  And even than, ignoring it would still likely be the smartest decision.  This demonic possession phase has run its course.  In all honesty, the genius \"Devil Baby Prank\" used to market Devil's Due is scarier and more entertaining than the actual film itself.\n\nSuperpower Film Scale: 1.5/5\n\n1: Villainous Waste\n\n2: Careless Bystander\n\n3: Hero unaware of powers\n\n4.  On the verge of greatness \n\n5. Heroic film\n\nStandout acting hero: Zach Gilford & Allison Miller",

It mixes together elements from various found-footage films, particularly the Paranormal Activity series, and it never really pushes the genre in any new direction.  I also found the believability of the \"found-footage\" conceit to be somewhat tenuous during certain shots.  Also, the husband who films everything is extremely cheesy and annoying, and I longed for something to kill him off.  Still, Devil's Due manages to become creepy during the final third of the film and is worth a watch for found-footage fans and those who dig Satanic horror movies.

It was even sweet for the husband to get a clip on camera so his life wouldn't be distracted by physically holding a fairly big camera in his hands.\n\nBut a film about a woman who gets impregnated with the antichrist shouldn't necessarily take place from marriage to birth. The story telling just becomes too sped up and eventually becomes just ridiculous and you realize that you have been cheated into spending your money to watch just another stupidly made paranormal movie.\n\nAspects of the impregnated woman and her affect on the people around her (priest, niece, sister, husband) were shown but we never were given a follow up on the situations or the reason for it.

I could literally predict everything that was going to happen, what line of dialogue would be said next, and how it would end. The film is filled with cliches which become very annoying. Some of these are the dog growling at the baby in the stomach because it is to represent evil inside, while another one with the dog is where they edit the footage at the exact time when the dog is barking at the camera and they raise the volume to purposefully try and scare you. This is something I get offended by because it shows that they do not have confidence in their movie and the \"real scares\" that will come along later so they try to do a cheap scare like this to guarantee to themselves that the audience will jump at least once. The film is repetitive because we go from the mother showing us that something is wrong and she is being taken over by a supernatural force and then everything is okay. Then back to something wrong and then everything is okay. It gets to the point where I was sitting in my chair thinking: \"Okay we get it, something is not right. She has a demon or the devil in her. Move on already.\" My final gripe with this film is that the characters are so unbelievably stupid. The things that happen in this film, I can tell you no sane human with even a shred of common sense would do most of the things these characters did. Two good things I can say that were good was the acting and the special effects near the end of the film when things start going horrible but unfortunately that is all I can say positive about this film. Very slow build up, stupid characters, unoriginal and repetitive, predictable, and very anti-climatic with virtually no pay off at the end. \"Devil's Due\" is definitely a perfect example as to why January is known as the month of terrible releases. If you do want to see it, wait for it to come to a dollar theater or for a friend to get it and watch it at home. Otherwise, skip this film.",

Ok so the premise of the movie was good, although it's basically taken from Rosemary's Baby but found footage style, no real big scares, Overall it was mostly just the stages of a woman's pregnancy with the odd \"weird thing\" happening to her, it wasn't as good as Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones even....Nothing interesting until the last 7-10 minutes, the camera is so shaky in this movie you get motion sickness, it's jumping vertically, horizontally like someone spinning around on a fair ride. There are also camera's staged in the house (like paranormal Activity) WHY not film the movie normally?? The same style applies to this movie like the other movies. I hope this found footage style dies off soon, the teat has been milked dry.",

This brings us our first lesson. People who have a fetish for filming their own tedious existence are a beacon to Satan and his demons. So if your partner is one of those dump the fucking weirdo.\n\nAnyway back to Zach and Sam the unfortunate young couple in this film, we see them get married then go on their honeymoon to Dominican Republic.\n\nLesson two, never trust a taxi driver in the Latin America, if the taxi is full of rosary beads or Jesus dolls they are definitely Satan worshippers.\n \nOur couple end up in an underground nightclub, get wasted then wake up in their hotel room, typical yanks three tequilas and they are shit faced. So they return home and low and behold Sam is pregnant. Cue unprovoked bouts of violence, tiredness, sleep walking and a scene that puts Sam top of the FBI suspect list for who killed Bambi's mum. Add in weirdo's stalking the couple, and their house looking like pagan ritual site.\n\nLesson Three, we get the catholic priest who seems to know an extraordinary amount about Satan and Satanic rituals. Which let's face it only happens in horror films, as most priests are more interested booze and children.\n\nSo all in all yet another crock of shit horror film, that will no doubt make a decent profit as it look like it cost about $65 to make and spawn \"Devils Due 2 - Shit returns\" and \"Devils Due 3 - Seriously you mugs are still watching this shit\".\n\nIt says it all really when the Labrador is probably the only convincing actor in the film.\n\nFinally Lesson four, don't watch this shit, you have been warned.",

Sure, found footage started out surprising like Cloverfield, and the first couple of Paranormal Activity's and Chronicle was a different take. But now, it lost its energy and is becoming the same thing over again and filled with clich\u00e9's of people carrying cameras during a terrifying scenario. \n\nDevil's Due is about a newlywed couple Zach (Zach Gilford) and Sam (Allison Miller) going on a honeymoon in the Dominican Republic. Until they visit an underground club, and they both wake up the next day after passing out. They arrive home, and Sam finds out she is pregnant which they are happy for the start of a family. Until she is slowly transitioning with possession like effects and mysterious people are secretly keeping them under surveillance. While her baby could be the antichrist, and Zach tries everything to save her.\n\nThe plot felt like it borrowed some concept like 1968 Rosemary's Baby film but in a found footage format. There was no thrills or scares that can keep the movie engaging. It was boring and slow that it was hard to care about what was going to happen next in the movie. The clich\u00e9 of the main character carrying a camera during uneventful scenarios was not as believable. \n\nThe movie felt like a bad amateur style filmmaking abusing the concept of found footage. It really looked like it when there is no sense of excitement anymore. Devil's Due is horrible and it is showing that found footage concepts have run its course.",

This movie is found footage and although I am slightly biased (as I love it's use) I understand people have got tired of its formula. This movie, however, is refreshing and doesn't rely on gore and cheap shocks. It's a clever piece of storytelling with some perfect glimpses at evil. There were also some great uses of SFX towards the end. But the most striking element of this production was it's sound; it completely eerie from beginning to end and plays havoc with your senses throughout. A superb feature from Radio Silence and I for one am looking forward to seeing what they do next.",

Starting off you get to know this couple, Sam and Zach who have great chemistry together, they take a trip to the Dominica Republic for their honey moon. After a night of partying they meet up with a taxi driver who takes them to some underground party and that's when the film gets really interesting. The films main problem was that it wasn't scary. Thrilling at times, and even creepy, but not scary. The acting is actually very good with two likable leads, but I think the film would have been better shot the traditional way rather than FF. Lots of weird crazy stuff happens throughout, especially towards the end of the film like most FF films. Overall, the film had two great lead actors, and it had a crazy finale, but I was never really scared and I kinda wanted more. The film does end in a way to where they could do sequel, which I highly doubt will happen due to poor reviews, I guess we will have to wait and see!",

This is mediocrity in scene by scene basis. It's almost surprising, if it's not so sad that the producer or director once thought imitation of other horror films could be a substitute for real tension. Furthermore, displaying it in found footage style doesn't add anything, let alone mask the unoriginality.\r The lackluster story is about two couples who happily spend their honeymoon, but in the end meet with dubious characters. After some bizarre forgettable occurrence, the bride is pregnant. No, this is not Hangover, although it would\u2019ve been better. What follows is a mix between pregnancy scare and overused gimmicks. The theme has been used before, but this is acceptable, many movies use already proven formula and produces new material. Devil's Due, on the other hand, cobbles together pieces of other works in hope of anyone who hasn't watched horror movies in years will find it amusing.\r Its use of found footage mechanic further confuses the plot, because some of the scenes shouldn't have been captured in the first place. It uses all security cameras which are in vicinity of the story, it's not only one vlogger type, yet it still feels unauthentic and staged to capture certain scenes. It probably would've been slightly better if it's done in simple third person view.\r There's not much excellence in acting either, the usual scream and frantic gaze. As an intimate experience of maternity, the movie could've depicted more personal issue. The scares aren't much better, often showing people in trance or shouting randomly. Every part of the movie is dull, any horror it has is watered down because it's near exact replica of others.\r Granted, those who had or having the delicate 9 months marathon could appreciate it better, but why would they watch this movie, why would anyone for that matter?",

A young couple you will like comes upon misfortune at the hands of a bunch of voodoo like weirdos in some tropical travel getaway honeymoon destination. The movie trudges on carrying you along with it to its predictably bleak empty and no hope conclusion which bugged me since I hate no hope endings. Someone might actually leave this film feeling worse than they did when they went in to see it. I wish they would make better movies personally. After you have seen 1500 people scream and gush blood from every pint possible the whole things gets really old. What helps this film is the way the couple are portrayed as genuinely being in love with each other. Their bond does not survive the onslaught of evil doers-so why even make the film? Mix it all down and you get a five out of ten. And it probably cost what a small country makes in a year to film.",

Normally, I don't have prejudices with remakes or rip-offs, but some well-honored and acclaimed films leave no room for that and, when that happens, we quickly find that the new movie is so inferior to the first one that it doesn't justify its existence. It's more or less what happens here. The plot is almost the same: Zach and Samantha are a couple on their honeymoon. However, after a party where both get drunk, Samantha feels she is raped during a satanic cult. On waking, however, they thinks this was a dream, not feeling any mistrust when she becomes pregnant. This will change over the course of her pregnancy, as Samantha takes on a strange behavior. The plot brings little new when compared to the classic film that precedes it and it's clearly inferior in quality. It all seems unrealistic, far-fetched and absurd, which is criminal in a film that had low production budget but a huge budget for advertising. The actors' performance is mediocre. Allison Miller and Zach Gilford are the main actors and they certainly tried to do their best, but the truth is that the material they were given was too bad and they just ended up dropping their characters. Personally, I don't blame them, I blame the directors (Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett) and screenwriter, Lindsay Devlin. The film spends most of its time focused on the changes of the pregnant girl, at a deliberately slow pace that would help create suspense if we didn't predict what would happen so easily, if the ending wasn't so uninteresting and if special effects weren't so basic.",
