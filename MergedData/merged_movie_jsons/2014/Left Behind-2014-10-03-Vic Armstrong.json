The book I am sure is better, since many have read it. This movie is a career killer ...it is sad to see Cage left behind by Hollywood. The acting is bad , Cage tries hard to make work out of a script that was seemingly penned by 8 year old's . I mean the dialogue is terrible. Why waste your money making a film that is just bad. Cage needs to really rethink his career . Honestly I felt ashamed for Nick . Wild at Heart , Leaving Las Vegas, and Oscar winner... My God man have you no self respect? Nick you are better than this.",

            "review_title": "If I Had Been Raptured While Watching This Movie I Wouldn't Have Minded",
            "content": "As a non-fundamentalist Christian, I remember when the Tim LaHaye book (on which this is based) came about. It stirred a lot of excitement in those fundamentalist circles. I was never especially interested in it; never read it. To be honest I wasn't especially interested in the movie either (and never watched the earlier Kirk Cameron version.) But - hey - it's on Netflix; I had a free afternoon. How bad could it really be? Well, pretty bad. It isn't as awful as some people say it is. To be honest, the actual moment of rapture was kind of well done. People's clothes just dropping to the ground as they disappear leaving everybody else with either mouths agape or screaming in terror. It was kind of cool. And it's true that millions of people (whether Christians or anyone else) just simply disappearing all at the same time would cause chaos around the world - although we didn't see much of the world. Just a bit of New York City and mostly the airplane.You see, most of this movie is set on an airplane. Nicolas Cage plays the pilot - Captain Ray Steele (which is a kind of a cool name - kudos to LaHaye for coming up with it in the novel.) The Steele family is divided. Ray and his daughter Chloe (Cassi Thomson) are non- believers (Ray's having an affair with a flight attendant played by Nicky Whelan), while Irene (mom) and Raymie (young son) must be believers - 'cause they get taken to heaven, meaning we don't see much of them. I thought the scenes on the plane were semi- believable at times. Passengers had a variety of reactions - aliens or time travel or conspiracy or whatever. There were times of panic - although by the end everybody seemed surprisingly calm. There's a wee bit of suspense as the plane approaches New York City with no fuel. But overall the story and characters were pretty weak.As for the theology, or at least the moral message? Well, first of all all children go to heaven. Because we get told that there are no children left. No age was attached. Do you get a free pass to heaven until you're - 10? 13? 16? I don't know. And, boy, once those Christians are gone it turns out that most of those who are left are looters or related thug-like folks, because there's lots of looting. And most of the Christians who were portrayed before the rapture were of the - shall we say - extremist variety, so this is clearly a triumphalistic sort of message from the fundamentalist community - come over to our side because we're gonna win! And there was really no great attempt to explain the idea of the rapture. It's not an idea that's universally accepted among Christians, and it's really a kind of bizarre idea. This is obviously supposed to be a sort of religious propaganda; an evangelistic tool meant to unfortunately scare people into believing that they better believe or this terrible thing is going to happen and you're gonna be \"left behind.\" But scaring people into faith rarely works in my experience, and if it does it calls into serious question the very reason why a person would believe. The Christian faith as I understand it is supposed to put the focus on caring for others; this kind of evangelism tells you that you should be worried about yourself. And there's that irritating song that closed the movie out that I hadn't heard in years. \"I wish we'd all been ready. ... The Son has come, and you've been left behind.\"This isn't as absolutely horrible as some people say it is - although I wouldn't have objected to being raptured during it. I could have seen that as an act of divine mercy. Of course, I wasn't raptured during it, but I will confess that I fell asleep and missed the last 20 minutes of it - but I was interested enough to go back and see how it ended. Everything's kind of left up in the air - maybe leaving open the possibility of a sequel, since there have been Lord knows how many books in the series. I doubt that will happen. I would think this has a very niche market. Fundamentalist Christians might yearn for more. Others (like me) might check it out on Netflix, but I certainly wouldn't pay to see a sequel in a theatre or specifically rent a DVD of a sequel. (3/10)",

            "content": "Once again I was deceived by the trailers as they made this movie look absolutely amazing; however, the trailers were the only good things that came out of this movie, and that says a lot.First of all, we have the common Christian movie stereotype where some of a family is for God, and some of it is against God. Than we are provided with the frequent misunderstandings non-Christians face regarding the meaning of scripture due to Christians who have almost 0 theological education. So because the Christians fail to provide an adequate answer, the non-Christian lashes out. At least provide the audience with some level of complexity if you're going to have some kind of a theological debate. Your audience understands more than you think. Now if we could simply ignore the horrendous script not to mention the awful acting, we still have a movie full of stereotypes regarding non-Christians, Christians, Muslisms and even smaller people (just trying to be politically correct) which got old very fast.But believe it or not, this is not even the worst part of the movie! The worst part is the terrible background music! To put it bluntly, it was GARBAGE!! It was so floaty and totally ruined the atmosphere. Now don't get me wrong, some movies require floaty music, but it would have made more sense to have music that was thematically apocalyptic. For example, Armageddon, Independence Day, or World War Z each had excellent pieces which blend perfectly into the atmosphere of the movie. The fact is even if the script to a movie is mediocre, having an excellent soundtrack can drastically improve the atmosphere. With a corny 80's saxaphone piece playing in the background, or cheesy orchestral music, which sounded digital, my wife and I walked out of the movie going \"what did we just see?\"Though I am a pastor, I was hoping to be raptured during the movie. Do what I should have done and save your money by not seeing this film.",

Religious bias is arrogantly displayed (but I'll leave that to the unfortunate viewer to spot). Complex ideas like forgiveness, atonement and judgement are reduced to idiocy at an atomic level.

Worst of all is the message its trying to send. Isn't it curious that the movie tried so hard to portray all of those that were left as bad messed up people? So is that supposed to mean that those who don't believe in the Christian God are all either cheaters, flirts, gamblers, thieves, drug addicts and just generally messed up? Because that's what I saw. Don't think I wouldn't catch that. I get that its a Christian movie but its still a pretty offensive way of showing off your faith. Even in the Philippines, which is predominantly made up of believers, people in the theatre couldn't help but laugh at how absolutely ridiculous everything was. Worst movie EVER",

            "content": "Nicolas Cage made himself a household name in the 90s and early 2000s with various action roles and dramatic roles. This actor has started in some memorable roles that have drove him into the cinematic spotlight, but lately his filmography seems to have taken a downward slope, with a number of ill-fated roles. This apocalyptic thriller based on a best selling faith- based novel series by Jerry B. Jenkins is only another role to pull Cage deeper into his career trajectory. Directed by Vic Armstrong, this Christian thriller stars Nicolas Cage as Rayford Steele, an airplane pilot who is unexpectedly called into work on the day his daughter Chloe (played by Cassi Thomson) arrives home from college for his birthday, much to their disappointment. Chloe comes home to visit her religious mother (played by Lea Thompson) and little brother. After brushing off another one of her mother's religious testimonies, Chloe takes her little brother to the mall for a little brother-sister time. Suddenly within a blink of an eye, millions of people (including Chloe's brother) around the globe vanish leaving their clothes behind in an event known as The Rapture as described in the Bible. With the world plunged into darkness and chaos and Rayford's plane on low fuel, he, Chloe, and the remaining survivors fight to survive in the fateful event unknown to them. Christian dramas are often subject to poor reviews by critics, mainly for their lazy production value and acting, and having seemingly nothing on their agenda than to shove their religious messages down your throat. I personally don't have much of a problem with Christian dramas since I'm a believer myself, along as they are good. This one is the very opposite of good. And this all starts with the horrendous acting by just about everyone in the cast, especially Nicolas Cage who serves as the main star. None of them are remotely convincing in their roles, particularly in the scene when Cassi Thomson watches everyone around disappear within a flash (literally) and her reaction is awfully calm for someone who just witness a significantly mysterious event. The worse matters from the writing which often comes to be laughable and redundant. After the first twenty minutes, viewers spend over an hour with the characters trying to figure out the vaguely explained event that those (mostly Christians) already know happens, and the scenes never land. The only possible redeemable scene may come from Cassi Thomson's character speaking to a lonesome man at a Church who discusses about asking God for forgiveness of our sins, something mentioned in the bible multiple times. The rest of the film ponders through non-stop choppiness and even worse, it spends almost no effort on delivering its holy message. Instead, it focuses on the survival of these airplane passengers which quickly grows tiresome before the first hour. Left Behind is thoroughly incompetent thriller with poor writing, poor acting, and an overall thin direction by Vic Armstrong. This film is completely soulless and empty in entertainment, even for those who are devote Christians, though those who enjoy religious themes may come to ignore the lazy production value. It is just sad to see an actor like Nicolas Cage in such a lifeless role, especially during this time in his career.",

            "content": "\"Left Behind\" is about the Steele family. Mother Irene becomes very deeply religious and active in church in recent years. Unfortunately, this caused spirited daughter Chloe, as well as her pilot husband Ray, to drift apart from her. When Chloe comes home to surprise her father for his birthday, he was called to fly a plane from New York to London, among his other ulterior motives. That same day, a distressing event occurs where millions of people simultaneously suddenly disappear, leaving their clothes and things behind. Those people left behind scramble to make sense of what happens, as Ray struggles to land his damaged plane safely back to New York.Academy Award winner Nicholas Cage once again majorly disappoints with his hammy and florid performance in this film as Ray here. He had a moment in the end where some genuine emotion came through, but it felt too late and too brief. It was good to see '80s sweetheart Lea Thompson back on the big screen again as Irene, but she was barely there. Cassi Thompson did her best to carry the film on the ground as Chloe, but her efforts were negated by the lines she was made to say and the stunts she was made to do. When the passengers were boarding the plane, I felt like I was watching a cheesy episode of the \"Love Boat\". Of course, there was going to be a sexy and flirtatious stewardess Hattie (Nicki Whelan). There was a hotshot TV journalist Buck Williams (so this is what Chad Michael Murray is up to nowadays), a Moslem guy, an angry midget guy, a sleazy businessman, a nerdy Asian (!) conspiracy theorist, a nervous drug addict lady, an even more nervous gun-toting mother (Why did you accept this role, Jordin Sparks?). I guess you can see the chaotic over-the-top acting circus. In fact, this whole film had an 70s-80s TV movie look and feel about it. Even the opening credits looked from that era. If \"The Remaining\" had a horror approach to depicting the Rapture, \"Left Behind\" played like a bad B-action film, down to its fiery, explosive, down-the-wire, narrow- escape type finale. The Christian agenda was obvious from the start, and I did not mind that. In fact, I was looking forward to seeing how they would tie it into the story. However, even as a Christian film, I felt this film did not do its job well at all. Oddly, it made Christians appear unnaturally nutty or weird. Worst of all, its evangelical message was lost in the confusion and the cheese. 2/10.",

            "content": "I saw \"Left Behind\" because I have a strange hobby...to watch as many of the films as I can from IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list. This list consists of the 100 lowest rated mainstream releases. So, obviously this is for horrible films, and I assumed the movie was horrible. The problem is...it's not a bad movie at all! So why is it on the list? I have three theories. First, it's become very fashionable lately to hate Nicholas Cage. Two of his films (this one and the remake of \"Wicker Man\") are on this list...yet neither is a bad film....but folk love to talk about how rotten an actor he is. He was just fine in \"Left Behind\". Second, the film has a super-narrow appeal...to Evangelical Christians...in particular folks like Baptists, Church of God and other such denominations. Why? Because these churches tend to preach about the end times and the Rapture. Other denominations, such as Methodists, Lutherans and Catholics do not generally hold this doctrine. So, if folks who aren't brought up hearing about the Rapture see the film, they are probably more likely to dislike the plot. Finally, my other thought is perhaps some group of folks have flooded IMDB with scores of 1 (such as how 4chan has attacked a few films en masse). All I know is technically speaking, it's a decent production...not nearly earning the abysmal score of 3.1 it currently has.The story centers on a particular family. The father (Cage) and daughter are not thrilled that the mother (Lea Thompson) has become a Bible-thumping Christian. However, they are shocked when Mom, other believing Christians and all the children instantly vanish....sending the world into total chaos. It's really bad for Cage, as he's piloting an airliner over the Atlantic when all this occurs.Generally, the film kept me interested and was decent. A few things I didn't like were the ending where the plane made an emergency landing....you just have to see it to believe, I mean NOT believe it. Second, I thought the tiny man was a bit overplayed. Who is THAT hostile?? But apart from all that, a decent film....with decent production values and acting.",

This one strayed so far from the meat of the story, they failed to even get to the main character of the antichrist. Sad, after any Kirk Cameron film, especially one based on the book series I really enjoyed, I wanted someone to remake it with talent and a budget involved. They failed miserably here and like all those supposedly \"Based on/Inspired by true stories,\" it seemed they took 5 minutes from what really happened and embellished the rest.There is really not much to say here, as they said very little in the movie. Basically, and I am only summarizing the movie since there's 95% of the book you're missing, a broken family is trying to get back together while the world experiences a sudden disappearance of millions. They say \"millions,\" but also all children vanish, which I would assume would probably be at least a billion. But, whatever.The acting was bad, score terrible, songs blah, dialogue eh, they failed to fully commit to God (or even mention Jesus) as was the premise of the story and worst of all: No Cage Craziness when this movie needed it from beginning to end.Normally when a movie is very, very bad, but I didn't hate it that much, I would at least give it 1\u00bd stars out of 5. But, honestly, I saw absolutely no redeeming qualities here. EVEN if you haven't read the book. Skip it!* * *Final thoughts: That all said, I did manage to laugh out loud a couple of times\u0085all from unintentionally hilarious scenes. Too many to remember, but the boy in the beginning eavesdropping on his mother and sister and popping in and out from the hallway had me hopeful there would be more LOL segments. Maybe this will end up in a year or so on the \"so-bad-it's-good\" list, but right now there weren't enough scenes to ever make me watch this mess again.

I got all that and more from \"Left Behind\" and it made for a great accidental comedy.First things first, this movie is boring\u2014like the kind of boring where you find yourself hoping for chores to do or realizing you'd rather spend your time doing the things you actively avoid as the movie progresses. The film wants to believe it is thrilling with the peril that Nicolas Cage's character, the laughably named Captain Rayford Steele, finds himself in but the action unfolds so lethargically slow and so predictably that it's absolutely impossible for the film to be remotely exciting or even make your pulse move slightly faster. Secondly, the film wants to be uplifting and meaningful but the morals of the film are so messed up that they make the Christian faith look worse rather than better. The film \"This Is the End\" actually represents a better God than the one you see in this film.Finally, the film has some really, absolutely atrocious acting. It's not really surprising when you consider the characters have absolutely no depth to them and are only defined by whether or not they have faith and, when they don't, are summed up by what sin is their favorite. However, even when this is taken into consideration, the cheesy, over-the-top, and hammy acting is very prevalent and is pretty amusing to watch. Especially when it comes to Nicolas Cage who is clearly unable to hide the fact that he is doing the film only for the paycheck and only decides to give a little bit of effort before the credits come rolling in.\"Left Behind\" is nothing special or meaningful. It isn't groundbreaking, Earth-shattering, and it definitely didn't change my life or make me \"find God.\" Instead, it amused and entertained me because it was so poorly put together and so easy to make fun of. It's possible to make a great film based on faith and religion that is moving and emotional\u0085this just wasn't one of them and was rather something absolutely silly much like \"God's Not Dead.\" I tip my hat to you and ask you how is your day, sir and/or madam!

Mind you, there are those who are hoping beyond fiction, or the potential real causes for such a thing. I go with the movie flirtation. Amongst other things you can check out the latest state of the art in special effects. In latest years, when you pick a film starring the most overrated of all stars, you might just end up seeing an end of times variation. The line-up Nicholas Cage heads this time is for what must be Michelle Bachman's favourite movie. The first part of the film you spend hoping it'll kick in soon, this end of the world, and with wondering if all the badness you chew yourself through is intended, say, as a reflection on clich\u00e9 character set-up in a writer's cheek instead of a tongue. The music is of much help here, because it is as cheesy and clumsily clue-driven as the acting and the screenplay. Hunky hero meets girl on airport and they engage in meaningful witless conversation about tragic things; music on clue. Daddy has to fly a plane on his birthday and cannot be with daughter, so they have a heart to heart with only slightly different music on clue. Daughter right back to hunky hero, and the same music on clue as before. It gets worse, though.Turns out the only reasonable person within the story's realm is mum, who everybody thought of as crazy, because she just knew what dawned, and it literally happens in a flash, and also quite literally as they say in the bible. Yes \u2013 it's the rapture!Kids are lifted and saved, because they're good, and faithful Christians are saved, even if they're packing a gun. The rest are left with the, spooky, no, actually not, left with the comically empty clothes of those risen to Heaven and with having to figure it out, down on the ground, though not really, while making their way through the havoc unleashed by the ensuing panic, and up in the clouds, in every sense of the expression, trying to deal with airplane issues that include disappeared and now assumed naked passengers and a fuel leak over the Atlantic. And they do figure it out, the whole to be expected cast necessary for a Christian lecture tale, the drug addict, the gluttonous candy lover, the greedy business man, the angry midget, the vain stewardess and of course the wife-cheating captain alias Mr. Sad Puppy-Eyes. And once they figure it out they express regret over not having had time for the kids, being so job-orientated and, off camera and presumably cut, for eating so many candy bars. Again with much help by the music and an equally unoriginal, uninspired script. We got action, since that plane needs to be landed safely, captain Puppy-Eyes resolving he cannot let those people die with all their sins on their minds, and we got family values, as daddy and daughter find back to one another via cell phone, plane-landing and other heroic acts that are potentially redeeming in the eye of the Lord. Here's my favourite little detail. Amongst the predictable cast of washed together characters we also have the kind, gentle, friendly, reasonable and faithful Muslim. And he really is kind, gentle, friendly, reasonable and faithful. He takes care of the old lady shaken with fright, he does his part in settling conflicts. So no trouble with the orthodox end of Islam to be expected there. Also because they just might miss the bigger picture: here we have a deep believer in an only slightly different version of the same god, and he's good, he's faithful, he's all a deity can wish for, and yet he's among those who are NOT lifted to Heaven. Because he believes in this slightly different version. Yes. Oops.And it all ends in the to be expected reunion of loved ones, having survived a near fatal plane-landing that went exactly the way we knew it would, now looking at the burning city and forward to years of darkness. After which they'll do fine, promise, as we've witnessed them finding back to faith.The whole thing is one ugly piece of literal bible evening Christian propaganda coated in an excess of unhealthy sugar and aimed at the extremely gullible, made by those who have at this point only movie- making while waiting, salivating, for the real thing. And the viewer is the one left behind, with trying to decide whether Mr. Cage is either desperate and gropes for just any role offered to him, or whether he's a fundamentalist Christian himself, trying to contribute in spreading the message. And Zeus knows, this film is messagy. It also confirms that with Christian issues-themed material it is very much as with right-wing humour: it doesn't work. It's uninspired, it's lacking fabric, ground to stand on and anything that can remotely approach convincing sense, and it inevitably results in fabulously bad acting. Anything you wish to see that is already a huge set of steps up the ladder to quality, watch a Troma production. Which is, in these dark times, where I turn to in prayer: please, Troma, spoof this one!",

Whether he was a burnt out alcoholic in Vegas, or a chemical weapons expert sent into a disused prison to take on terrorist ex soldiers, he was still great fun to watch and a guaranteed draw at the Box Office.Where did it all go wrong for Nicholas Cage? It seemed that, despite being popular with the fans, he seemed to give up on the cinema and be banished to straight-to-DVD releases. I've forgotten how many times I've been browsing 'New Release' films online and come across one of Cage's film that I'd never heard of. Our of my love for his nineties work, I watch it faithfully. Then I wish I hadn't. 'Left Behind' is one such film.Cage plays a pilot who's flying his jumbo jet around the world when most of the world's population disappears. It's a sort of supernatural event, but it could also be looked upon like most of the world's population would rather inexplicably disappear than star in such a film.Those 'left behind' are all pretty unlikeable sorts, none of which you'll really care about. Much of my viewing time was spent wondering which shade of 'dark' Cage has started dying his hair.Without wishing to give away too much about the plot, I've looked at various internet message boards about this film and found that it has stirred up some online debate between those who believe in a \u2013primarily Christian \u2013 God and those who generally don't believe in anything. Personally, I don't find anything wrong with a film which is based on religious principals. You don't need to 'believe' to like the film, although I find it hard to believe that anyone \u2013 religious or otherwise \u2013 will find anything particularly entertaining about this film.It's just poor. There's little to say about this, other than to avoid it. If you like Cage (and many of us still do), watch one of his old films. If you like supernatural films then you probably own plenty which are a million times better than this. It will only ever be remembered as \u2013 yet another \u2013 of Cage's misfires. But, just because I may not have faith in this film, I still have faith that he'll one day star in a great film which will remind us of what he's capable of. I wonder if Stallone can get him on board for the Expendables 4? It might be a stepping stone to re-launch his career.",

Adjusted for inflation, the tiny budget of the 2000 take on the franchise's first book is only a third of the new one, most of which appears to have been spent on nabbing a name lead. Left Behind clearly wishes to be a Stealth/Non-Stop blockbuster that sneaks Christian fundamentalism into the multiplexes, but even for a Bible Belt product \u2014 and especially for a wide release boasting a major star \u2014 it's rather cheap. The film could have worked. At its heart, buried under pounds of propaganda and elitist moral tut-tutting, the first novel is a double genre piece \u2014 a plane thriller crosscut with an apocalyptic horror show. Cage's airline pilot tries to calm his freaked passengers and find a way to land his increasingly tattered plane, all while trying to figure out what happened. Down below, Cage's agnostic daughter (Cassi Thomson) tries to navigate a society that quickly collapses, though, amazingly, school buses populated only by clothes are still mysteriously flying off bridges a good 15 screen minutes after the incident. In the end the film is nothing short of predictable, and the twists and turns just do not make up for the length of the film.

This one has a bigger budget and bigger stars but somehow manages to be much, much worse. As with the first movie, the plot is going to turn away some viewers immediately. I didn't really have an issue with the premise since I knew what it was about and nobody tricked me into seeing it. What I do have issues with is the lack of quality on this thing from top to bottom. The writing and directing are among the worst I've ever seen in a movie with an eight-figure budget. The special effects are very unimpressive; about what you might expect from a made-for-TV movie, not a theatrical release. The worst part of the whole thing is the acting. Every single actor in this is terrible. I've come to expect a certain degree of terrible from Nic Cage but he really takes it to another level here. A lot of the younger actors I'm barely familiar with but, after seeing them here, I will make sure to avoid anything they're attached to in the future. Probably the saddest part for me was seeing Lea Thompson in this. Why, Lea? Is this a religious thing I'm not aware of or what? You are better than this dreck. We're ALL better than this!",

After all, I don't believe in hobbits, vampires, witches, The Force, etc, either. The truth is, though, I think I would hated this movie even *more* if I'd been a believer.Let's face it, The Rapture is the ultimate middle finger to nonbelievers; the final \"We told you so!\", so it's strange that the movie puts religion in the back seat. The couple of overtly Christian characters are mealy mouthed and annoying, and we're kind of relieved when they're gone. The other \"Christians\" are pretty covert. For example, a stewardess seems more than happy to gossip with another about the latter's upcoming sexual tryst, without the need to lecture her on her behavior. It's only later, when we find \"Bible Study\" in ridiculously large block letters in her (by then abandoned) calendar that we learn the truth. If she'd kept her schedule on an iPhone, we might never have known.Basically, the Rapture is just a vehicle for an action movie - a really, really lame action movie. The entire movie focuses on the fate of airline captain Rayford Steele and his plane, which I understand is just one part of the book. The central problem is that as long as one able-bodied pilot is left, The Rapture would really be more of an inconvenience than an emergency for a plane in flight. They get around this by throwing various obstacles in his path to build tension. These range from contrived to comically contrived, and in the end you've got something along the lines of an unfunny version of \"Airplane!\". I kept expecting Leslie Nielsen to come in and say \"We're all counting on you\".Of course, the biggest disappointment is Cage himself. Nicholas Cage is a talented actor who is famous for taking absolutely any role to pay down his enormous debts. Still, even in the worst movies, he usually fully commits to the part, and you at least get some campy fun. The godawful remake of \"Wicker Man\" comes immediately to mind as a good example. If ever there was an excuse for his trademark histrionics, this is it, but his just mumbles through his lines, with the look of embarrassment never entirely leaving his face. He really looks like a man who's seriously questioning the choices that have led him to this - not in the movie, but in his actual life.Not good, not \"so bad it's good\".

This is precisely why I found this movie to be hopeful. The only problem is how to get God to take away all the other radicalized, fundamentalists from the other Abraham theme religions too. I wondered, as I laughed my way through this film, what the producers would think of a propaganda film by The Islamic Nation or other radicalized Islamic group whose major point would be a big \"I told you so, but you thought we were crazy\" film plot.Crazy is what this film is and it really is just a validation of some pretty outlandish ideas that were born out of millennial cults and other cults that splintered off the main religion centuries ago. I cannot blame Christians, Islamics or Jews for the nutters among them, nor will I discount the intelligence of a person who believes what others might consider myths, but the evangelical Christians and their kind are just a few cards less of a deck.I also will not blame Cage for appearing in the film, after all like De Niro said when as asked why he did The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle...hey, this is what I do for a living. He does a very understated performance, which for him must have been difficult. He could have gone over-the-top, as he usually does, but he reigned back his emoting and puts in a fair performance even with some pretty corny dialogue. The direction is amateurish, the lighting is bleak. However, the CGI is pretty good and some pretty good cash was spent on the stunts.",

However, I could accept this in the hope that things would pick up and become more exciting when the film is in 'full flight' - apologies for the pun. Sadly though this simply doesn't happen..OK so once we're on-board the aircraft we get introduced to a wide variety of characters all of whom have different personalities and backgrounds - it seemed to be a case of covering all bases here. Once we get to know them, some of the passengers vanish without a trace leaving the audience and the remaining survivors trying to figure out what has happened to their loved ones. The trouble is that the wishy-washy script skirts around the issue for around 45 minutes with most of the time being spent with the passengers arguing and coming up with increasing ludicrous suggestions as to what has happened to the remaining passengers. Perhaps this approach was employed to make things more tense or to give the film a sense of mystery, but it isn't pulled off particularly effectively here meaning that large chunks of the film are tedious.Even when the film does start to try to make sense of what's happening it doesn't do so in an entirely convincing way; I understand that the good people are taken to heaven and those that have sinned are left back on earth - presumably the pain and suffering of having to live without a loved one is penance for their sins. This aspect of the narrative would have perhaps been more involving if we'd have learned more about the characters - particularly the ones on the plane. If we'd have learned some of the good things that the good people had done and the bad things that the sinners had done then I might have been able to buy into it more. However, just having people disappearing at random with no real explanation till towards the end of the film makes a lot of the film feel redundant and silly. Speaking of random and silly, look at Ray allowing Buck into the cockpit area (even before all hell breaks loose). I can't imagine any pilot doing that certainly in the post 9/11 era.There's no doubt about it Left Behind is a strange film and is definitely something of an acquired taste (although looking at its IMDB rating I'm not quite whose taste it is supposed to be acquired to). You get the feeling that the intention here was to produce an action film with something to say. The end result however is a film that is too dull to fall into the category of action and too muddled to be make its point in a coherent manner.",

How was $16 million allocated to this? Most of it most likely went to Nicholas Cage. Nicholas Cage is a good actor, but he needs to fire his agent. It's worse than usual here. Rather than doing one of his famous maniacal performances, he phones it in and nearly puts you to sleep. The plot isn't even paper thin: People disappear and it's something to do with religion. This is supposed to be a Christian movie, but it really isn't. The religious aspects are poorly handled and the religious characters are all presented as crazy and delusional. The only good thing that can be said about this mind blowing awful plane wreck of a movie is that the finale is admittedly tense and there's finally some sort of emotional investment in what should have been Direct to DVD. Sadly, just when you think it's finally over, they set it up for a sequel. Cue face palming.The direction is utterly terrible and boasts no artistic merit of imagination. The acting is painful to watch and is so bad it feels like parody. It's not even unintentionally hilarious. There's little to no plot, the screenplay is painfully underwritten and lacks anything to actually attract the audience's attention. It's a terrible movie. I've run out of ways to further hammer home that point. Just don't watch it no matter what you do. Why should people waste their time on this? Even if you aren't spared from this highly unpleasant trip down the cinematic toilet bowl, don't watch the planned sequels. They'll most likely be just as awful. This is a total disaster of Roland Emmerich proportions and there are simply no benefits to seeing it.

            "content": "A movie about the Christian eschatological viewpoint of the end of the world and those 'left behind' on earth could had been interesting; if done, right. While, the original films made in the early 2000s, could be seem, as a cheaply made church basement movies. Cloud Ten Pictures adaptation of the book source material by authors, Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins was a lot better than this remake. This movie didn't have a prayer. Unlike the previous film, this movie directed by stuntman Vic Armstrong didn't stay accuracy to the source material at all. It felt so uncompleted. The reasons for this, is because the film only focus on first few chapters of the first book, rather the whole book. So, a lot of the bigger & better material toward the end, never got told. The movie even has the nerves to omit some of the biggest characters from the book, from this film. So, no Nicolae Carpathia or Chaim Rosenzweig in this film. These are characters that basically help pushed the protagonist toward the belief in God. Without them, the film kinda fall apart. While, the movie has tons of Christian symbolism, it doesn't look like a Christian movie at all. The story is so tightly focused on the airplane trip from the first few chapters that it felt like a different type of a movie. It felt more like airplane disaster flick, than anything. The movie doesn't makes Christians even look good, at all. Within the world of the movie, Christians are portrayed as insistent, crazy, delusional, or at the very least, just really annoying. The movie portray, the Rapture in a very blasphemous matter, by making the event seem like a joke. People disappearing, while leaving their cloths behind, is a bit silly. Yes, I know, that Christianity teaches that people will be give up, their moral bodies, once they reach Heaven, and how original innocence will be restored, to you, but seeing messy laid-out clothes in public, give the impression, that somebody out, there- has to be streaking. It kinda funny, that a Christian movie like this, would be OK to portray violence, but they're not allow to show underwear. Maybe God made an exception and raptured people's underwear as well. It's also pretty bad, the director chose, to have the breakdown of society, happens within minutes, rather than realistic, taking his time, to have the world plunged into chaos. I really doubt, the world will go all apocalyptic, that quick, when millions of people suddenly vanish. Rather than people being dumb-founded or confused by the events; in this film's world, most people that are left behind, just go ape-sh*t, and start to loot, and murder each other. In my opinion, if the rapture did happen, you would think that most people would try not to sin, in a last ditch attempt to win God's good grace. I really don't get, the movie's approach to the rapture. First off, how on earth, is all the children in the world, allow to be rapture, even if they're not baptized or follow the Christian religion? Is the film, telling us, that children are not sinful? I really doubt that! There are tons of brats, around the world that clearly are not good. Another thing, why is it, only Christians? A devout peaceful Muslim or a Jewish guy can't go to heaven!? Yes, I know, the book was written by a stubborn protestant approach, but wow\u2014that's pretty awful. You would think, anybody who follow the Abrahamic religions and good-hearted would have a good chance of being rapture. Anyways, the movie continues to be offensive to those religions by having the Muslim on the plane is assumed to be a terrorist, and the selfish middle-aged Jewish businessman realizes his love for money has ruined him. This movie is very hypocritical with its preachy message. Money is evil, the movie says, but the marketing for this movie ask people to pay to go see this film! Just when you think, the movie couldn't get any worst, it has an angry racist dwarf and Jordin Sparks going berserk with a gun. Wow, that's just bad. The main actors weren't that good as well. I didn't like Nicolas Cage as Rayford Steele, as Cage didn't bring any passion to the role. He seem so tired, and depress, about being there. I didn't like the changes, they made to his character. First off, the events of the movie taken place on Rayford Steele's birthday, instead of his son, makes the emotional toll of his family getting taken away from him, a little weak. I also didn't like how Buck Williams (Chad Michael Murray) in this film, became a supporting character, when he's supposed to be, the main character. Buck's lack in journalism skills on the plane, leave much to be desired, as well. He's given, little to nothing to do. While, Cassi Thomson gave an alright performance, as Chloe Steele. Her character journey felt like a different movie, compare to the airplane parts. Most of her scenes were pretty pointless for the most part; because of this, the movie has really terrible pacing issues. The cheap looking visual style didn't help as well. I didn't like how locations in Baton Rouge are supposed to look like New York City. They look nothing alike. Audiences, Christian or not, deserve better than this. Overall: I would take the political thriller concept of the original movie, over this Airport '77, rip-off. You'll be praying for salvation if you do bother watching this awkward apocalypse.

I think I'll leave the ludicrous action of the last half hour to others because there was one thing about this film that really shocked me: The Rapture.I'm not religious and I'm not anti religious; I just think it's a waste of my thoughts sitting around wondering about something that can never be proved either way; I'm Agnostic basically. However, this film did make me think more than I ever have before about the modern (1800s to present day) Rapture doctrine, specifically what it says about people who believe it. I mean, if I was a believer in something and my wife and son weren't, and I was magically transported to safety while they were left to die, I really can't see myself feeling good about that. Not even my family, just vast numbers of my fellow human beings would be enough for me not to enjoy it if I'm honest! So having foreknowledge of such an event and still viewing it as a great thing, even lording (sorry) it over people who don't believe, comes across as quite twisted.This film \u2013 and I'm sure this was not its intent \u2013 has really opened my eyes to the extraordinary narcissism that lies at the heart of modern (and predominantly American) Christianity. I'm not anti American either; I have family in America; but America does appear to be a spawning ground for the really toxic breeds of Christianity.Just to be clear. I go to church with my wife and I've read the bible plenty, and I can tell you that the bible describes no single, irrefutable chain of events for the Rapture. Accounts are varied, contradictory and very much open to interpretation. This film portrays a version of the Rapture that is not accepted by mainstream Christianity (the Catholic Church for example).So in summary, while this is a technically terrible film with pathetic script, feeble supporting cast, and a pace that would put snails to sleep, it is all overshadowed by the fact that it really does raise questions about the basic morality of modern Christian beliefs.The only saving grace here is that the whole thing is so married to the Hollywood blockbuster apocalypse formula that it ends up belittling its own message.",

He tells her he is piloting a plane to London and the two argue. While flying, passengers vanish into thin air and everyone wants answers.

First thing I have to say is that I have never seen the Kirk Cameron movies or read the books so I can't compare this to those. Also many of you know how I feel about Nicholas Cage so that will play a role in this review. I do have to admit this wasn't his worst movie and he didn't bug me as usual in this, but that is probably because he wasn't in it all that much. As for the movie itself, it was very cheesy and had the same aspects that most faith based movies do that bother me so much about them. When the rapture happens those that are believers will get called to heaven. After the good disappear it instantly becomes a free for all. Parents see their children vanish before their eyes and their first instinct is to start looting and take TV's and rob everyone they can. Movies like this have an unrealistic view of \"non- believers\" and that is why I am not a big fan of these faith based movies. Overall, all that said though this wasn't as bad as I was expecting.

Besides, I tend to enjoy such apocalyptic fiction, and even Nicolas Cage starring in some Evangelical hooey involving planes won't turn me away. I like \"Knowing\" (2009), after all. But, \"Left Behind\" is absolutely dreadful. Every scene is agonizingly contrived and ridden with clich\u00e9s to push its simplistic religious agenda. There are sinners, and there are saints, and all either any of them do is talk about God. The substandard CGI for the plane stuff is far more realistic compared to just about every conversation in the movie. Additionally, the pacing feels like Purgatory, while the overall experience is like Hell.The doubled irony of \"Left Behind\" is that its cockeyed moralizing is undermined by focusing on the here and now instead of the hereafter and on the ultimate heroism and good naturedness of the irreligious, whereas the faithful, albeit perhaps inadvertently, get people killed and put many more in danger because of their faith.

Hollywood never likes anything with actual meaning, unless its a documentary. Now I'm not saying this was a 10/10, but it sure wasn't a 4... I would rate this movie a 7/10 because it had all around solid acting, some funny parts, a moral message, and entertained me. Sure there are some parts that are a bit cheesy, but that's to expect in a Nicolas Cage movie. The plot is basically out of nowhere, the \"rapture\" occurs and God takes those up to Heaven that he feels need to go. I personally thought it was quite interesting, but not astounding. Anyone could watch this movie if they so desire, for there are few-to-none swear words, and a small smidgen of blood. Overall I'd recommend this movie if you are just looking for a overall solid movie.",

I know everyone rags the career of Nicholas Cage but, even though I don't particularly rate him as an actor myself, he does appear in two of my favorite films - Raising Arizona and 8mm, so he must have something. Nevertheless, I can think of no reasonable or logical reason why he agreed to appear in this strange, evangelical Christian, turkey of a movie. The film is supposed to be about the 'rapture' and the sudden disappearance of most of the people on earth but this theme is almost a minor sub-plot to the main disaster movie theme of a damaged plane low on fuel with no where to land rescued by an 18-year old girl with the ability to drive any and all heavy plant and earth-moving machinery. It's far too earnestly Christian for any normal movie goer and no where near Christian enough for true believers. Basically, it fails on all fronts.",

Based off the very popular \"Left Behind\" book series, neither the Kirk Cameron version nor the Cage version, seems to be able to translate the literature following to the big screen. Really, who had the brilliant idea to place Cage as the pilot? A role that should be easy to conceive and adapt to his particular lack of ability to emote? Certainly, even the emotionally devoid Cage should be able to convey some sort of quiet strength, some sort of something. Problem is, the screen adaptation and his teaspoon depth emotional range are a double hit to the head. This film is just bad. Horrible. The factual content aside, common sense errors are evident. The stewardess talks into the wrong end of the phone, the mascot on Chloe's sweatshirt, the fact that the pilot boarded a plane without so much as a carry-on. Yeah, just a really, really bad film. I'm usually the kind that gives it the \"benefit of the doubt\" kinda girl. But, this stilted dialogue, the \"investigative reporter\" conducting impromptu interviews on board, and the druggie in the bathroom just made it a little too much for me. The Rapture. Yeah, OK ummmm, yeah, no. Just a RRREEEEEAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLYYYYYY agonizingly tortuous film. And, just for fun, guess what.....that sound? Probably the sound of Nicholas Cage's SAG card flying away.

It's so lucky that his daughter (just in college) is like Evel Knievel on a motorcycle! She managed to find a truck and clear the road so he has somewhere to land.

I clearly remember the impact of reading the Left Behind book almost 16 years ago as a boy in middle school. Few other books have had such a profound impact on my life so I hold the entire series close to heart.However, I share all this to say that this movie is nothing but a hot mess. Here's a short list of sins. 1.) A soundtrack that sounds like bad elevator music 2.) Maybe it was just my theater but the dialogue was also difficult to hear 3.) Casually calm characters on the airplane after one of the most horrifying events known to mankind has just occurred 4.) Out of place comedic relief and 5.) So-so acting.To be fair though, there were some improvements from the original movie. The rapture scene was markedly improved and actually made me gasp because it truly occurs unexpectedly. The action shots were also much better and the acting was improved but for the star power involved was rather weak. Many of the airplane scenes felt overly contrived with stilted acting.The movie doesn't necessarily follow the plot of the Left Behind book as it's merely inspired by it but it doesn't matter with all the aforementioned problems. There's also a lot less preaching in this film than the original but frankly could have used more as to convey some message of inspiration.If you're a fan of the Left Behind series I wouldn't say completely disregard this film but please don't have high expectations that this movie will deliver and improve on the original. I've waited 16 years for a movie to convey the fear, excitement, and triumph that enthralled me when I was an 11 year old boy staying up to the wee hours of the morning trying to read just one more page of the book. After watching this movie, it looks like I'll have to wait for another remake.",

Typical christians - that's inciting hate.Just about every scene is geared around fear mongering. Right down to their sky fairy taking a husband, but leaving his wife behind unprotected - an elderly woman with dementia.

Oddly enough, it turned out bad, but not THAT bad.Here's the thing: It's decently casted (Cage of course being the lone big name, and sadly he delivers a performance sub-par his other movies), fairly (if mostly over)-acted, well shot, good choice of locations and good FX... but... on the other hand, what drags this thing down to ground level is that corniness of the plot and script, the odd musical choices, the deep hollowness under the the otherwise OK acting, and its boilerplate predictability. I scratch my head at how they could make this last 2 hours. And that Speed2-esque scene.... I'm sitting here with a frozen shot-eating grin on my face.I don't mind a flick with a religious theme, as it is can provide a fresh breath of air from a cinematographic space that is increasingly being filled with movies made from the usual overused trope elements. This one however could have been done a lot better. I do wonder who will cringe the most at this movie... the non-believers or the believers. I have a feeling it'll be the latter ones.Verdict: OK popcorn flick if you can stand the religious stuff. In any case you'll have a good laugh at it after-wards.

            "review_title": "What if?",
            "content": "Released in 2014, \"Left Behind\" stars Nicolas Cage as an adulterous airplane pilot on a trans-Atlantic flight who has to save the remaining passengers after many of them mysteriously disappear; meanwhile his daughter back in New York (Cassi Thomson) struggles with the disappearance of her little brother and mother (Lea Thompson). Chad Michael Murray plays a famous reporter on the plane while Nicky Whelan plays a sexpot flight attendant.This is sort-of a theatrical version of the 2000 direct-to-video movie of the same name. I say \"sort of\" because it's a severely truncated rendition, which doesn't mean it's necessarily bad, but fans of the bestselling book will likely be disappointed by the smaller focus. It worked for me, however, and I'll explain why momentarily but, first, let's consider two other reasons for the critical feeding frenzy\u0085 Some people might have been disappointed because they were expecting blockbuster quality when, in fact, the movie only cost $16 million. (The original cost $4 million, in case you were wondering). While $16 million is enough to make an okay theatrical release, it's not even close to the typical $100 million plus required to make a modern blockbuster disaster flick, like \"San Andreas.\" As such, the movie has a glorified TV-movie vibe, which film snobs zero-in on and lambaste.Another big reason for the uber-negative reviews, of course, is the Christian-themed subject. Since the average person understandably finds the very idea of faithful believers being snatched away in the blink of an eye ludicrous they hold the movie in contempt. What I don't get is WHY such people would even be interested in viewing a movie like this when they know up front that it's based on a massively popular book with overt biblical themes.So why did I like this movie? Because I was able to ignore the relatively low-budget production and get involved in the lives of the characters and their amazing story. I say \"amazing\" because how else would you describe a situation in which masses of people, including all children, suddenly vanish with only their clothing left behind? It would be an incredible experience, to say the least, not to mention a serious wake-up call for those who remain. The movie effectively reflects this. In short, this is a \"What if?\" movie. You don't have to believe in the Bible whatsoever to enter into the story of the characters and enjoy it for what it is \u2013 a \"What if the Rapture really happened\" movie. I don't believe in malevolent and wickedly ugly aliens with acid for blood, but that doesn't prevent me from liking the \"Aliens\" flicks.Furthermore, I appreciate the smaller focus of the story compared to the original movie. By doing this, it doesn't cut off more than it can chew. It focuses on one family and one airplane & its passengers and drives its point home without being awkwardly preachy. Lastly, Cage and Murray make for strong male protagonists while Thomson and Whelan are more than effective in the female department, including being extremely easy on the eyes.The film runs 110 minutes and was shot in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Provo, Utah.GRADE: B",

            "content": "Going into \"Left Behind,\" I was expecting a low-budget attempt at the disaster genre much like producer Paul Lalonde promised in interviews he conducted prior to the movie's release. I have to say I was impressed with the new direction and take on Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins' bestselling novel. I wouldn't necessarily call it an improvement over the original version, but it looks and feels more like a genuine independent Hollywood production. Millions of people suddenly vanish across the planet as the world is plunged into chaos and destruction. A small group of survivors are left behind to figure out what's happened to their friends and family. The happening leaves pilot Rayford Steele (Nicolas Cage) and investigative journalist \"Buck\" Williams (Chad Michael Murray) 37,000 feet in the air trapped inside a plummeting airliner with panicking passengers to contend with. On the ground, his daughter (Cassi Thomson) wanders the streets of New York looking for her mother (Lea Thompson) and brother (Major Dodson) amidst the chaos and devastation.\"Left Behind\" is very much set up like a 1970s disaster film. \"Airport\" immediately came to mind as the different characters and their motivations were set up. It was in the vein of a mini-version of a huge ensemble cast the likes that we'd see in \"The Poseidon Adventure\" or \"Earthquake.\" The situations play out a bit overly dramatic at times, but it doesn't completely derail. Nicolas Cage plays pilot Rayford Steele, who must keep his passengers calm while trying to find a way to land the damaged plane. He doesn't play \"Crazy\" in \"Left Behind\" the way you would expect him to in a religious film about the Rapture. After a bit of a shaky start, his performance is very sincere, reserved, and genuinely emotional.Last time around we had former child and teen actor Kirk Cameron step into the spotlight as investigative journalist \"Buck Williams.\" This time we have Chad Michael Murray in the part and he seems a bit more adventurous and daring than Cameron did. Instead of wandering the world trying to figure out how millions of people have disappeared in the blink of an eye, his investigating is secluded to the damaged commercial airline Nicolas Cage is piloting.Lea Thompson, on the other hand, has a small role as Cage's wife who recently turned her heart to God. She comes off as over-phoning it in and seems artificial in her scenes. It's really not what I was expecting from an actor I'm used to seeing give strong performances in hit television shows and movies like \"Switched at Birth,\" \"Red Dawn,\" and \"Some Kind of Wonderful.\" The special and visual effects in \"Left Behind\" were actually well done. granted, there weren't anywhere near as many scenes of destruction and chaos as I would've hoped for. All the disastrous occurrences were isolated to one plane, a single car, or a school bus crashing over the edge of a bridge. They also seemed to only happen to the main star of the movie as she wandered around the chaotic city. It all seemed a bit convenient from a story angle and affordable to pull off from a budget standpoint. \"Left Behind\" is rated PG-13 for some thematic elements, violence/peril and brief drug content. A extra-marital affair is insinuated but never really shown. One of the passengers of the airplane is a drug addict and they show her getting ready to snort some cocaine. The only violence is some car and plane crashes and people rioting and looting in the streets.There are only three opinions you can have walking out of the movie. One is to take it as scripture and believing the things you see on screen. The second opinion is that it's a piece of fictional entertainment not to be taken seriously any more than other disaster films like \"Airport,\" \"The Towering Inferno,\" or \"Meteor.\" The last choice is to totally write off the entire concept and chuckle at how ridiculous the whole thing seems.Is the Rapture and Tribulation Biblical? Are millions of believers going to disappear one day and leave non-Christians to fend for themselves against the Antichrist and his minions? I tend to believe in the concept as a Christian who was raised in the Southern Baptist Church. However, I can't sit here and prove to you that's how the end will come. The only thing I can say is that I respect anything that makes human beings dig deep into their hearts and attempt to figure out who they believe in and what they're going to stand for in their lives. \"Left Behind\" accomplishes this feat and gets viewers to take a little personal time and reflect on those notions.",

            "content": "Instead of letting his wife convulse in skimpy outfits onstage to convince people into embracing Christianity, the pastor in question could have used the funds to make a movie on hindsight like what Stoney Lake Entertainment has done here.For the uninitiated, Stoney Lake Entertainment is set up to produce faith-inspired films for the masses and their intention is to create a franchise for Left Behind which in turn is based on a series of popular books by Jerry B. Jenkins and Tim LaHaye. This is not the first time Left Behind is being made into a movie however, in actual fact it was originally done in the year 2000 and followed by two other sequels.Lake's CEO Paul Lalonde co-wrote this remake that involved the biblical Rapture where faithful believers are taken up to heaven before the apocalyptic end of days. The narrative begins with the Steele family at the JFK airport. Father Ray Steele (Nicolas Cage) is an airline pilot who is struggling to keep both his marriage and children together while beginning an affair with a sultry air stewardess. His daughter Chloe (Cassi Thomson) is upset by his father's absence and she also has problems understanding issues of God especially with her religiously inclined mother.Within seconds of the opening credits, we are treated to a shot of a book called \"Acts of God\" and seconds later, a woman begins rambling about the end of the world to a supposedly famous TV reporter, Buck Williams (Chad Michael Murray). There isn't much subtlety to talk about and the frequent hackneyed writing and wooden performances worsen the viewing experience further.The touted Rapture happens about an hour later. On the flight where Ray is piloting to London, dozens of passengers and all the children onboard just vanished, leaving behind fear and lots of head scratching. On the ground, the same strange occurrence happened. Chloe's younger brother mysteriously vanishes at the mall leaving behind his belongings. Petty crimes, looting and robberies starts happening everywhere. It is the end of the world people, so everyone just has the urge to commit crimes. That makes a lot of sense. Because this is a character driven drama with good religious intentions, we are treated to more subplots and stock characters on the plane. For example, the obligatory Muslim passenger (who might be a terrorist), an annoying little man, a black woman who pulls out a gun out of nowhere, and a rich business man who suddenly develops concern for his estranged daughter; meanwhile, Chloe is playing Supergirl helping Daddy land his huge malfunctioning plane on a deserted highway. No worries though, Daddy has a helping hand as co- pilot- the handsome and attractive Chuck.Technically, this US$16 million production is often hampered by poor visual effects, sloppy editing and laughingly, a weird 1980s look to the entire flick. The usually entertaining Nicolas Cage with his batshit crazy acting turns up pretty somber and underwhelming. Left Behind is a heavy-handed, preachy movie disguised as an apocalyptic action thriller. Even veteran stunt coordinator Vic Armstrong who helmed this project couldn't make this any better. This movie is best left for believers while the rest might prefer to sign up for bible study for a start.",

Because when the screenplay insists on having a couple of delusional characters preach Christian teachings at every possible opportunity, that's what God wanted apparently, I don't blame him. This rapturous apocalypse drives everyone crazy. Civilians purposefully stealing things to highlight how sinful they are. Even driving our protagonist to attempt suicide. The world is manic, and it's \"God's\" fault. But it's fine. Honestly! Armstrong depicts our beloved deity as a beacon of generosity.

Reaching the half way point to his destination,Rayford loses control of the plane for a few seconds. Regaining control,Rayford discovers that half of the passengers have disappeared into thin air,which leads to Rayford & the passengers fearing that they are about to enter an apocalyptic world.View on the film:Whilst he has become a legend for his breath-taking stunt- work,director Vic Armstrong shoots the film in a manner that is far from legendary,with Armstrong using stiff camera moves during conversations between the passengers and the Steele family.Showing a tiny bit of flair with the boom-smash action scenes,Armstrong drags the title down to the ground,by pulling back the moment things start to heat up,in order to regain focus on the painfully dull Steele family affair.Assisted by writers Jerry B. Jenkins and Tim LaHaye in adapting the first of their 16 (!!) novels to the screen,the screenplay by Paul Lalonde & John Patus takes an extremely harsh view on any characters doubts on the movies religion,which ends up making the film look like a hilariously nastier version of The Old Testament ,as everyone from scientists (boo!) to people who follow non-Christian religions are sent straight to hell,whilst the true believers walk the stairway to heaven.Openly having most of the major characters laugh at even the thinnest scientific explanation,the writers show the worlds upset over losing half of the global population to be one which calms down within minutes of taking place,which leads to this adaptation being one which should have been left behind.",

But, the person who he's having the affair with is still there too!. It turns out that all the people who have never sinned, have gone to a better place, and all the sinners have been..............Left Behind!!!Well its a bad film. Within five minutes, the religious undertones have already been stuffed down our throat in the most overblown way possible. A copy of the book 'Acts Of God' is purchased, and a woman has a huge rant at one of the main characters.It also looks really cheap, and the attempts at humour are totally out of place, and just feel way too desperate. And despite it trying to deliver some sort of message, hilariously offensive in some scenes, especially involving one character on the plane (you will know straight away when you see the film).But, and its a really big but, its watchable in so many ways. Cage just looks bewildered the whole way through the film, like he has a gun pointed at his head off camera. The man had one of his greatest performances early in the year with 'Joe', and it ends with this lump hammer of a movie.And its funny for all the wrong reasons. Someone is about to jump from a bridge, and there phone rings, and and the heartbreaking scene where one character hugs her brother, and he disappears, has to be one of the funniest scenes of the whole year. In fact with the added bonus of it looking like people are throwing clothes everywhere, makes it all the more entertaining.But seriously, its a bad film, but I will be watching it again, because it's just so entertaining, and I hope they will make a sequel.It's the new 'The Room'.",

            "content": "To begin, I need to preface my review with this: I DO NOT believe in the pre-tribulation rapture theory. I believe in the mid-tribulation rapture, like the Bible actually speaks of. LEFT BEHIND, from the getgo, is founded on the idea that one day God will collect a bunch of people in Heaven, and everyone left on the planet is (sort of) screwed.This film is a remake of the original film that starred Brad Johnson and Kirk Cameron. Whether this version is closer to the book or not is beyond me, for I own a copy but have not yet read it. The shocker in my viewing was that practically every bit of the film takes place on the plane where Buck Williams and Ray Steel are stranded after the rapture takes place and a ton of drama has begun to unfold due to the worry of people losing friends and family whom were also on the plane.I can't help but tell you immediately that this film is awful. The only things I actually find worthwhile about this movie are unintentionally comedic moments--many including the midget character that seems to hate everyone. The guy is like a live-action Grumpy Cat manifesto, and I absolutely adore any moment that he's shown on the screen for the sheer fact that he is hysterical (unintentionally, of course).The acting here isn't even worth talking about. Seriously. There isn't even a flip-out moment with the star, Nicholas Cage, whom is notorious for being borderline psychotic in almost everything he's in. Nope. Nothing. Nada. Because he is playing a character whom wants to keep the people of the plane calm.And to mention the rapture itself, I now claim that the Chloe character is the Antichrist, due to the second she hugs her brother, he vanishes into thin air. I seriously couldn't hold it in; I laughed so loud at how goofball-ish that moment was that I actually received nasty looks from people whom probably thought I was simply there to make fun of the movie for being Christian. Tsk tsk; I'm on your team, nastylookers.The CGI, in my opinion, looked solid in the trailers. After seeing the film, I can assure you that you're missing nothing because (a) the movie is very dull outside of its kind-of themes and sort-of touching moments (all of them seemingly taking place at the very end of the film), and (b) because the CGI that is actually used is horrendous. There's even a moment where Chloe is making a life-and-death situation out of herself and she climbs a bridge. You can literally see the greenscreen in bits through her hair. I'm not even kidding.When it comes to the music in LEFT BEHIND, I can promise you that none of it fits. Remember how the original trilogy barely had music, and when it it did, it was horrible modern Christian Rock? This film doesn't even get that much. It's essentially a collection of songs that sometimes resemble what I would expect from a Pixar film.I feel that anyone whom might be hoping this will be a so-bad-it's-good situation will be pleased, for the most part. However, anyone else looking for a fun Christian time might as well spend the money on that number they might have found scribbled with a knife into the bathroom stalls of their local barhouse. Because this is awful. This is unruly, to be frank.God bless the Midget Man! I give LEFT BEHIND an F as a serious rating, but a C as a so-bad-it's-good rating.Thanks for reading, friends, and God bless you all.And please don't fall into this pre-tribulation rapture lie.",

Though made with noble intentions, it is all the same not a very good movie. There's nothing wrong with the idea of the movie (The Rapture happening) - with the right care I think it could appeal to both Christians and non Christians. But it is really badly executed! The dialogue is awful - stilted, and often not sounding anything like real people (Christian or not) would say. This is probably why the acting is also pretty bad, as if the actors can't relate on any level to their characters. Even Cage (who CAN act) can't do anything with his character. The story is also badly written, with a lot of situations and actions that will make you groan even if you are not an expert on aviation, Christianity, or any other topic. And while the movie had a budget much higher than your average Christian-themed movie, it often looks cheap and impoverished, not just with the special effects.How bad is this movie? Well, the filmmakers apparently couldn't find even one positive film review from a critic to quote on the Blu-ray container, since they instead list a positive blurb from one of the members of the cable show \"Duck Dynasty\"!",

In no particular order (and ones i can remember)1. Captain leaving the flight deck without really talking to the F/O, no handover of control.2. Captain returns to the flight deck using emergency flight deck access code. This does not unlock the door immediately.3. Why is the aircraft in an unusual attitude? At that altitude the aircraft would be on autopilot, not manual flight. So without either pilot on the flightdeck it would continue straight and level and the current speed until the fuel ran out.4. Non-Standard unusual attitude recovery (disregarding the fact it wouldn't get into one)5. TCAS with the other aircraft. Capt failed to follow the TCAS resolution advisory which would have guaranteed minimum separation between the 2 aircraft.6. With that substitutional damage on the aircraft wing there would be an incredible amount of airframe vibration.7. wing was damaged, why does he lose elevator control?8. At point of divert JFK would not be the best airport to divert too. The great circle route between JFK and London would take you up the coast of Canada then passing just south of greenland. Most likely airport which could take an aircraft at that size would likely be Gander or similar.9. Changing aircraft type throughout the film.10. A lot of none-standard Radio Transmissions 10.1 using names on RT 10.2 Maydays are initiated by saying mayday 3 times 10.3 after declaring a mayday your normal callsign is preceded by mayday 10.4 all radio communication involves your callsign to identify who is talking and who you are talking too. 10.5 all attempts to contact were on VHF radio, no attempt made on HF? 10.6 while trying to make mayday he was selected on 121.9 (not a standard oceanic frequency) and while changing the dial he never actually made it active frequency so was always transmitting on 121.9 10.7 if you failed to contact anyone on a atc frequency a pilot would likely try 121.5 (guard) or 123.45 (aircraft to aircraft)11. Failure of flight controls would make the autopilot unusable. However he seems to continue using it (though seemingly from other parts of the film there is no continuity regarding the autopilot)12. Fuel situation, at the start of the flight the Capt says it will be a 6.5 hour flight, taking into account reserves and alternate fuel it is likely to be a conservative fuel for about 8.5-9 hours. However, he has a major fuel leak at the 3 hour mark which would probably cost him more than any reserves he had yet they somehow manage to fly 3 hours return back to JFK.13. Sat phone problem (not strictly aviation but bear with me).

I am sure i missed a few holes in the aviation side too but this made it slightly more amusing for me while watching.Source of knowledge about the holes in the aviation parts, I am a commercial Pilot.",

I loved \"Noah\" with Russell Crowe because it was brave enough to deviate from the strict bible story and explore alternative explanations of the retold histories of our planet from one generation to another. I hated \"Left Behind\" because it was bad, no suspense, no plot development, no character development, just a brief retelling of the basic facts of the story already so well known by all.James Cameron knew better than to just retell the same old story of a sinking ship.What most atheists who criticize horror/sci-fi/disaster movies based on Christian biblical references seem to overlook is that the best horror film for an atheist would be one which has us facing the scariest thing possible, and wouldn't that be a god or a \"second coming\"?

The coincidences are laughable. Some of the acting is, well, not acting. And the editing is dreadful. I swear, a scene is repeated near the beginning of the movie.I gave it a 3 rather than a 2 because I reserve that for films that use the f-word constantly. The lack of profanity is what saves this from a 2.SPOILER ALERT--The airplane landing scene was the only thing interesting about the movie, although the shenanigans Chloe went through to make it happen were pretty laughable.Questions: How does a flight attendant work in those shoes we see her in as she gets out of her car. And why is her shirt so tight? Why does she speak into the hearing part of the phone for flight announcemnts?How didChloe learn to drive all those vehicles? Why is there a lawn mower sitting in the front yard, yet no one seems to want to mow the overgrown grass? Why wasn't the Muslim saved? He appears devout. Aren't you supposed to take your shoes off when you go down those slides? Where were the other flight attendants? When Ray talks to the passengers, why doesn't he use the P.A. system--he speaks in person only to the first class passengers--don't the rest of us count? My theater shows quite a few of these \"religious\" films--I am guessing they are cheap and/or subsidized by the religious right.

I recognize some of the actors from series and movies and to be honest they should be embarrassed for their performance in this flick. It must be an incredibly bad director that can't even see to that basic acting skills are met, if it is the actors that can't nail the scene at all, get rid of them. The music in the movie is over the top and over dramatic. Its also bad timing when the music start in the scenes, its so bad that its perfect for a parody. The script is even more over the top than the music. Is this movie really for adults? This is one dialogue in the movie. When one of the passengers on the flight thinks she knows why people disappeared and talk to one of the lead actors. She remember from bible camp when she was little Its in the bible they say that millions of people will just vanish one day.Do they say why? I don't remember it was so long time ago (another bright passenger says) - Are you saying its (dramatic pause) the devil.No it was god. Where did they go?To heavenThen we have the religious part in this movie, is this movie made up from a fanatic religious group? This movie must be the perfect propaganda for everyone to become an atheist, in the movie atheist are just disappointed for people in their family died and therefore do not believe in god (like the only natural state is faith). Its so full with cult like version of Christian logic that in comparison the series seventh heaven is secular. For a moderate Christian this must be embarrassing as well. And then we have the effects that are so strikingly close to comedy that I wonder if its not comedy that its aiming at. The clothes thats left behind when people disappear have all the feel of a Monty Python scene. The real mystery is not why people disappeared but why this movie was ever made. Who in their right mind would back up this script and this director. Thats a true mystery.",

So Left Behind is the remake of the original Left Behind which was based in the book about what happens to those left behind when every Christian and baby go to heaven during the Rapture.-So as great as that concept sounds, the film was just bad. Like really bad. To be fair, the concept was really good and the scene where all the believers are Raptured was pretty good. Aaaaaaand that's where the fun begins and ends.-The pace was tedious and just cut back and forth between unnecessarily added drama on an airplane and a bad actress running around on earth.-Speaking of acting. Nicholas Cage was just Nicholas Cage and not a very good Nicholas Cage. Everyone else (mostly) was pretty bad with the daughter especially cringe-worthy. However, Marty from Pirates of the Caribbean was in it and actually offered some pretty funny lines.-Speaking of cringe worthy, the writing was really bad. Sooo many dumb things that are straight from a Syfy original. Random slomo explosions that actually reminded me that I liked Transformers 4 more! I literally would have been inexplicably if Liam Neeson had shown up to beat people up on the plane and then Denzel Washington landed it after rolling it upside down. Makes no sense right? Neither does the bad writing.-CG was really bad. Music was cheesy. Anything else? -I will give it one thing, there were a few lines that were pretty good, but the film really failed to get the message across. Literally everyone dodged the issue until Cage finally brought up the idea. Then several cuts to other scenes made sure that the explanations were all cut short and implied afterwards.-Content was fine.-So Left Behind had a great concept and should have been great, but just was not. Like at all. So I would say that Left Behind is just not worth seeing. Christian or not. Watch the original. Its sooo much better. And since I have to rate it, I would give it something like a 4 or 4.5/10. Yeah I'll give it points for the concept, Rapture scene, Marty, and ONE line.",

But if this painfully boring, bad excuse for a science fiction fairytale wasn't crazy enough, they even featured a Muslim bit actor whose \"God\" evidently wasn't the same as the Christian god (which is total horse manure), gets \"left behind,\" too. But what was perhaps the saddest moment of all about this pile of rotten dog excrement was the fact that Nicolas Cage's film career has evidently slipped so low that he would actually even THINK of participating in an pitiful piece of cinematic junk like this. Even his agent is probably wallowing in self pity for allowing him to destroy what's left of Cage's long career by starring in this turkey.

It could have been a half decent movie. The basic idea is perhaps not super original but it could have been made to work. However, it is simply loaded with religious bullshit. Once you filter out said bullshit, which is bloody difficult since you are more or less force feed it during most of the movie, there is really nothing left.The behavior of people are bizarre to say the least. The dialogue is mostly nonsensical. The movies attempt at putting different and original characters, including an obnoxious dwarf, on the plane is feeble. The action and special effects are generally lousy and the attempts to put some thrill and drama into the landing of the plane is laughable. Come on, you see a plane coming, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that it has no pilot and is flying in a straight line.

For starters, the cast of the earlier movie aligned almost perfectly with the book while this particular film had some definite weaknesses. For example, although he is certainly a decent actor, Nicolas Cage didn't seem nearly as convincing in the role of \"Captain Rayford Steele\" as Brad Johnson was in the earlier film. If anything he seemed almost uncomfortable performing the part. Additionally,I thought the scenario involving the airplane seemed to get much more attention than necessary and as a result it negated other equally important details. This fact leads to my main concern which is that this film is supposed to be a Christian movie. Yet the emphasis seemed to be more about the conditions on the airplane rather than the main story. In other words, it misses the big picture. Now, that's not to say that this was necessarily a bad movie by any means. But it didn't have the same impact as the original and for that reason I question whether this remake was even necessary. Slightly below average",

The movie basically said if you aren't a God fearing born again Christian you will not go to heaven. The only thing is a bunch of babies disappeared. How the heck are they God fearing if they were just born. They known no religion. That small Vern Troy guy was a laughing stock. The dumb blonde on the plane I wanted her to die of a dope overdose. I mean seriously I was an alter boy growing up for about 7 years. So because I am no longer one according to this movie I am not going to heaven and gong to hell....I cannot believe they shoved religion into everyone's faces. If I had to pay to see this I would of demanded a refund. I don't even know what else to say about it. There were a few good reviews. A 10 out of 10? One of them was written by the directors girlfriend. Holy %#it. Whoever wrote a good review for this is going to hell. You should of disappeared like the people in the movie and went straight to hell for lying and deceiving everyone you made actually pay to see this. Red Box should take this off their list of rentals and Netflix stock went down Friday after I watched this for 2 hours. Fu.",

Everything from the cinematography to the acting to the music to the script. Terrible terrible terrible!And boring! I kept falling asleep. There is this hilarious moment where we see people running around the parking lot of a mall like ants. It is ridiculous. There is a scene where a school bus falls off a bridge. A half hour after the rapture? Did it take God that long to decide if the driver was going to heaven or not?Word is that LaHaye was quoted as saying, \"It is the best movie I have ever seen on the rapture.\" Jenkins was quoted, \"I believe it does justice to the novel and will renew interest in the entire series.\"Well if you have ever tried to read these books you might believe it. Terrible. Not talking about the story. I am talking about the writing. I know 14 year olds who can write better and the same way with the script.Ashley Tisdale backed out of doing this movie. Smart move.There is this very funny moment where Nic figures out his wife has been rapturetized and he starts to cry but you can see he was laughing. That is sad. Really sad. It is sad that this movie is worse than the first version. In fact, the first one was downright amazing compared to this piece of crap. Do yourself a good deed.DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!",

If Nicholas Cage is having to appear in stinkers like this (and The Wicker Man) among others then maybe he should de-lavish his lifestyle a bit and choose his parts more carefully. I honestly don't know where to start the performances, the script, the budget CGI? I'll start with the performances...amateur at best and Cage gave the impression of someone who knew he was in a crap film, playing a character that in no way suited him and was racing to the finish line to pick up his cheque. The script was cheesy and who the hell has a full on theological and very personal discussion with an INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST (if he said it once, he said it a dozen times) after rudely interrupting a conversation at an airport? The whole feel of the film was cheap and I can honestly say I have watched better produced and acted TV commercials. My advice? Give it a miss and if you're waiting for the rapture and fancy a Nick Cage movie, watch Raising Arizona...it reminds you that he can actually be great in the right role.",

            "content": "1st watched 10/10/2014 \u2013 6 out of 10(Dir-Vic Armstrong): Effective biblical end of the world action/drama does a good job of showing us why the book that this is based on was so well received. The story starts in an airport where a daughter is returning home to visit a father, who is having a birthday, but has to work an only gets a brief exchange instead. Nicolas Cage plays the father -- who is a pilot and clearly has alterior motives for taking this flight as he intends to hookup with a young stewardess at their destination. The daughter then meets the other main character whom she takes a liking to, and then also boards Cage's characters' plane. Once in the air \u2013 a strange occurrence happens where some of the people disappear including the co-pilot leaving only their clothes behind them. We find out later that this same occurrence is happening throughout the world and is the cause of expected chaos in the air and on the ground. The acting and the representation of this event is believable and this is where the movie pulls off what could be a very silly plot. Cage's character later determines that believer's of Christ are those that are disappearing based on information he received from his wife --- who is a believer and has disappeared. For the most part this movie accomplishes it's task of being a thriller and an attempt at spiritual awakening. Cage is very good as he tries to put the pieces together to figure out what is going on. This 2nd version of the book does a much better job than the first although the ending seems unlikely and done for dramatic benefits. The movie completes itself, but also voices that this is \"just a beginning\" which could lead to sequels if it does well\u0085the authors have provided many stories if they want to do this, but we will see.",

            "content": "The Christian Biblical Prophecy of the End Times is just the gimmick they use here, the movie isn't really about that at all. I went to this movie thinking it would basically follow the storyline of the first book in the Left Behind series of novels. All they did was take the first few chapters and turn it into just another airplane disaster movie. Over the Atlantic bound for Europe, passengers disappear from the airliner, so the pilot turns around to return. Whether the plane returns safely is something you know one-third of the way through the book, but it's the main plot of this movie, and you don't know whether they make it back until the end. And the hero is the pilot's daughter on the ground, whose quick thinking helps her Dad find a safe place to land. It helps that she not only knows how to drive a car, but also a motorcycle, and construction equipment, not to mention her knowledge of how to manage a controlled explosion of fuel so as to signal the plane. Is she related to MacGyver, or something? In the book, she was just a snot-nosed college kid. Also, somebody in the planning stages apparently thought \"what this movie really needs is a dwarf,\" so a dwarf is among the passengers for no apparent reason. Most of the dialog in his scenes centers on his being a dwarf, and he plays no vital role in the outcome of the story, so I'm thinking somebody thought this would inject some comic relief into the flick. It must have looked funny on paper as they read the screenplay. Passengers have disappeared from movie and TV airplanes before (Langoliers), and pilots have had to try emergency landings before (Executive Action, Airport), so this is just another one of those movies. Snakes on a plane, William Shatner seeing a monster on the wing from his window seat, terrorists hijacking Air Force One....now we can add \"God calling True Believers to Heaven\" to the list of flicks in this genre. \"Starring Nicholas Cage\" ought to be enough warning for anyone, I would think. . . .",

The characters of Buck and and Chloe were great. Both seemed to be book accurate. Hattie was played by the lovely Nicky Whelan, but was more of a sleezy woman in this movie than she was in the book. Now for Rayford... it's Nicolas Cage playing Nicolas Cage. I really wish they would have gotten a better actor to play him... but I suppose they needed a big name actor to draw in viewers.Now for the plot: it started out following the book really well until the rapture happened... then it went downhill and off course fast. Something happens to one of the engine that causes the plane to be put in danger and it becomes a race to put the plane down quickly without killing anyone on the plane or on the ground... and Chloe has to race to make a runway on a road and flag the plane down... which NEVER happened in the book.

The acting is so bad at some points I even find myself laughing. The script is flat and the movie takes way too long to build up. Now I'm not a believer but I usually don't mind movies with a religious theme at least not as long as they're GOOD and actually brings something more but this movie did not. I'm not ashamed to say I actually got of the couch and the others, still hoping it might get better, were left behind(see what I did there, that's the only joke I can make from this movie, seriously). I officially gave up, have never done that before, I can usually find something that is at least a little bit interesting to keep me through even the worst of movies, may it be a characters personality or just a really good looking actor but this movie didn't even bring that, not that there weren't some people I wouldn't mind looking at for a bit more but I just couldn't take it anymore. The best part about the movie is that I didn't pay for it.(Thank God for rental(yes i did manage a second, awful joke, I'm gonna stop I promise)). Already a few minutes in I could see the clich\u00e9 ending, no twists, no turns and as the world went wild when people disappeared I realized I was right and just gave up. So please, no matter your reason to consider this movie, put it back! Put it back in whatever awful little box you found it in and let it be left behind(sorry).

This edition was nowhere near the book. I understand that books and movies always have details that are different but this movie was a big fail from the start.

The real-life lessons: maybe the only thing that can be taken from this movie is that a spouse can be driven away from what you believe (any kind of believes and ideas) if they don't understand those ideas and that is not your fault in any way but the spouses fault. If you love someone you should respect their beliefs even if you don't agree with them. Therefore, Rayford Steele can not be excused from cheating and not supporting his wife in any way. He was just a bad husband that did not love his wife enough and went for better looking woman.Plausibility: as I said this is quite a controversial movie and therefore the plausibility of the even and the story is left to be judged by any individual personally depending on what they believe. Characters: Rayford Steele, quite an unsupportive spouse. The movie tries to make us believe that his wife believes drove him away from his family but as I said I don't buy that. If you love someone you are supportive and respect their believes. They are no reason to drive someone away. From my point of view, Steel used his wife believes as an excuse to make himself feel better about cheating and being attracted to younger better looking woman. Just a weak men character. But I guess, it does happen in real life and maybe I am being to judgemental. I do not know how it feels when you think your spouse is going crazy. But I just know that you should not think your wife is going crazy in the first place just because of a disagreement in beliefs. I repeat, beliefs must be respected even if they differ from yours. Acting: how on earth did Cassi Thomson get one of the leading roles? She was just terrible. I found Nicolas Cage to alright and Chad Michael Murray too (however, he did not have much role anyways). Ending: terrible. Terrible, terrible ending However, even though the ending was terrible, it was also hard to predict which made the movie a bit more interesting. The development of the story line I believe was also well executed. A mystery happens that makes you curious about what could have happened, you kinda guess the answer but then the ending is unpredictable.",

But I wanted to watch it anyway because it has 2 things I enjoy - (1) landing a plane under perilous circumstances and (2) the consequences of people suddenly vanishing off the face of the earth.I'll address the first point quickly and spend more time on the second in this review. As a movie about landing a plane when you're out of fuel and the closest airport has no open runway, it did a good of job to keep me invested. It's not the best in its genre, but worked for me.Now on to the \"Rapture\". Full disclosure: I am not Christian. But I remember the time when a Christian floormate in college told me the story of the Rapture and it gave me chills. And I've been fascinated with the concept. This led me to check out the show The Leftovers. And then there's of course Avengers Infinity War and Endgame. Each of these three properties take a very different approach to what it means for the population of the world disappearing, but I won't focus on that here.But first, another disclosure: I haven't read the series of novels on which this is based, or the other series of movies based on those novels. However, from what I can gather, all of these follow the Rapture pretty closely. So, I'm guessing only \"the true believers\" get zapped into Heaven.But is that what really happens in this particular movie though? It leaves it kind of wishy washy in my opinion. In the family of the central characters, only the mother and the brother are Raptured because she was a true believer in Christ and the son was a child. The father and the daughter clearly did not believe in either religion or in Christ, which is probably why they didn't get Raptured. But neither of them explicitly state that they are atheists. It is implied that they are, more strongly for the daughter (and the journalist) than the father.Anyway, I noticed that they showed us many couples of whom only one member was Raptured and the other wasn't. Do we conclude that one person was a true believer and the other wasn't? It seems unlikely that you would have that many couples where there is such a huge discrepancy in faith. This led me to think maybe the person who didn't get Raptured has Sinned in some way and had not repented. After all, the sins of most of the people on the plane were quite clear (the guy who gambled, the guy who was very close to cheating on his wife, the drug addict, etc.)Interestingly there was a Muslim guy on the plane. I was curious - did he not get Raptured because he was not Christian / didn't have the \"right\" beliefs about Christ, or was it because he had Sinned? I did notice that he was checking out the blonde woman in a creepy way, so maybe he was a bad guy?But there are no answers to this question in this movie at least. I'm guessing the book series goes into detail about this. But I was also curious about how the Rapture was determined for children. Where was the cutoff? Was it a certain age and if so, how was the calculation of the age done? But I digress.I bring all of these up to address the philosophy of the movie.I went into this prepared for a very preachy Christian movie about the consequences of not Believing in \"The Truth\". That is why it surprised me when (1) there were no concrete answers to the points I raised above, and (2) the non-believing characters actually made well articulated and compelling points about why they don't Believe. In fact throughout the whole movie, we sympathize with these characters who were \"left behind\" and I felt like I could totally relate to their point of view. And while some of them were shown to have vices, some of them were also shown to be good people. (For example, the journalist goes out of his way to help everybody, and that Muslim guy was also shown to offer help to people around him despite some creepy vibes.) As far as the central characters go, the movie doesn't seem to blame these characters for not Believing or even paint them in a negative light.The point the characters make over an over again is - why would a loving God do these things? They talked about natural disasters and how people suffer and die due to them and how God does nothing to help. The \"God works in mysterious ways\" arguments is brought up but dismissed. And when the Rapture happens, the world goes into chaos, it seems so hard to believe that a loving God would do this.So what is the philosophy of the movie? That maybe God ISN'T loving. Maybe God is punitive and will punish all of us. The movie seems to raise the question, so what do you do if you discover that God is vengeful and punitive? And that kind of blew my mind. I fully expected that this movie would go to extreme lengths to justify God's actions, but it really doesn't. (Yes, sure, it does say that the people who were Raptured were taken to Heaven to be protected, but God was being PRETTY DARN exclusive and petty in who was Saved vs. who wasn't.)I don't know what direction the potential sequels would have gone, but to me it felt like they were going for a post-apocalyptic movie where the survivors of the Rapture would have to deal with the consequences of having displeased a vengeful God. And I don't think they would overcome this God by the end of it - by the end of it, they would have to give in and submit to this God. And that's kind of depressing.Another disclosure: I'm not atheist. I believe in God kinda sorta in my own unique way that doesn't strictly follow any scripture. But I do subscribe to the idea of a loving God and definitely not to one of a vengeful and petty God. And I also am not arrogant in my beliefs such that I think I am right and everyone else is wrong. So that could be why I had this take on the philosophy of this movie - that it raises the question - what if the Rapture is real even though it doesn't make any sense according to your beliefs? And that's a very interesting take, in my opinion.",

With the only preacher shown in this farce being told, \"Why should I (listen to you), when YOU didn't even listen to you?,\" LEFT BEHIND further mocks Rapture Believers. It implies that none of them should be allowed to have driver's licenses, or to hold ANY position of Trust. Even if the Rapturists took mass transit to work, they could NOT be surgeons, cops, fire fighters, soldiers, or even cooks. (How would YOU feel if your grilled cheese sandwich was LEFT BEHIND on the stove?)

I don't normally write bad reviews, if I don't particularly like a film I just rate it the amount of stars I find appropriate and move on BUT THIS FILM, god this film deserved a review. I wouldn't normally write one with spoilers in it either just in case someone did happen to click on this who hadn't seen it (lucky them), but seriously... there is nothing good to spoil.The majority of this film is absolute nonsense and it killed me from start to finish. I can't completely slate Mr. Cage's performance in this film because he was working with a script that was embarrassingly bad. The whole thing fell to pieces, the plot didn't make sense.The characters all felt generic or unnecessary and the actual \"disaster\" that causes the chaos in the film was an absolute joke, literally laughable. I mean, people were physically disappearing and leaving their clothes behind as if they had just disintegrated but the director decides to have floods of children's clothing just fall from the sky for no reason? What happened? Were a flock of 6 year old children all paragliding together when suddenly this incident occurs took them all?? It makes no sense.Stuff like the meeting between the male news reporter and Cage's daughter in the first act at the airport: This reporter comes over and sits down, taking off his bag and placing it beside him and we see a few minutes of painful dialogue between the two before Cage is spotted by his daughter and they embrace. The reporter then takes off with the briefest of goodbyes as if he hadn't just been flirting with this character for the last ten minutes and his bag just disappears off the face of the earth, never to be seen again.I feel like this film wasted it's budget a little bit. An example would be in a small scene where our female protagonist is almost killed by a crashing airplane that narrowly misses her and blows up her car instead. Sounds good, right? Wrong. Sequences like this literally last for a mere 5 - 10 seconds and add nothing to the story... they would've benefited by hiring a few more actors who could actually act.I don't know which disaster is more laughable, the one that's meant to ripping hell on the world or the movie it's shown in.",

Is it an action/disaster movie in search of an enabling premise of biblical proportions, or is it a Christian promo keeping it real by engaging impressive special effects?Many reviewers urge potential viewers not to watch this movie, and it certainly would not have been worth paying for. But on a slow Thursday night on Freeview it does have entertainment potential, partly for the aeroplane action (always a winner for me) and to watch Nicholas Cage wrestling with the script and to keep a straight face. My companion summed it all up with 'Nicholas Cage isn't an entertainer, is he? He's an actor, he will literally take ANYTHING for the money'. It occurred to me that it might well be satirical. In particular because the Muslim gentleman, despite being very nice, was so obviously 'left behind' for picking the wrong god. For the atheist there's no better shot than that. The totally LOL chucking of the midget down the evacuation slide' was equally un-PC. Which is great fun these days. A lot of people think the book of Revelation is jolly good farce.Perhaps someone said, 'What if half the passengers on a plane just disappeared? What would happen? We could have fun with that!' Plane stories are great because they provide isolated, trapped and cut-off groups of strangers primed to become obligingly hysterical. And instead of aliens, time warps or anything covered in The Twilight Zone, they went with mass ascension, just for shits and giggles.And the end, (which is 'just the beginning' according to the more damaged half of the daddy/daughter issue that apocalypse movies are currently so fond of) is just an absolute gem. The fires of Hell, caused by the sudden absence of the God's people who stop things catching on fire, appear to be waiting for those left behind. In secular Britain, we'd still have about 70 per cent of the population left to recover civilisation, and quite a few less quite annoying people to make it harder.For all the aforementioned comedy moments I give it a goodhearted 3 stars.",

Chloe goes to the mall with her little brother, and Dad's plane takes off for London. Then, all of a sudden, people start disappearing - literally: their empty clothes fall to the ground. We notice that the disappearances include a large proportion of children, including Chloe's brother while she is hugging him. It is a mystery, and it continues to be a mystery as Dad has to bring his plane (now damaged - the disappearances seem to leave a lot of vehicles out of control, and there was an impact with an empty plane) back to New York.This film is apparently based on the first in a series of books about those left behind after The Rapture although, for me, there were loud echoes of Stephen King's The Langoliers, Spielberg's War Of The Worlds, and assorted post-apocalyptic TV series. In fact, this film has a strong feeling about it of being the pilot for a series.I make no comment on the religious text of this movie other than that, given that the reason for the disappearances is The Rapture (as opposed to alien abduction or some other unexplained phenomenon), it would have been good to have understood the rationale for who got taken and who got left behind. We only know it's The Rapture because a number of the religious characters say so: it might just as easily be alien abductions.Oh, and the film is dreadfully, dreadfully dull.",

While the exact account of the rapture is not clearly evident in 1 Thessalonians 4:17.Left Behind tells the story of a small group of survivors who are left behind after millions of people suddenly vanish and the world is plunged into chaos and destruction.Nicolas Cage plays Rayford Stelle. He is airplane pilot for a major commercial airline, married to Irene (Lea Thompson), who is a born again Christian. During a routine flight from NY to London, a handful of people onboard the flight suddenly vanish, along with one of the air-hostesses and his co-pilot. Not knowing what has happened, he races against his own inner demons and time to make sense of the chaos and to keep the passengers and remaining crew sane.Left Behind has been slammed by some, and praised by others. That being said, if you put the religious aspect aside when you watch it, what you have is a film that tells the story of one family,from their POV, struggling to make sense of a world gone to chaos, and fighting their own inner demons and moralities.Even though the film ended with Ray landing the plane safely back to NY, I did feel that more of this needed to be explored, and I am sure that the directors will continue on with the series in due time.The acting centered mostly on Cage, and that is fine as he is a good actor in his own right. The SPX scenes were great. But it did need an element more to this film, apart from the ending we saw.I would recommend this to anyone who can put religion aside and watch it for what it is.",

The concept, which is about the miraculous disappearance of millions of people around the world, really didn't make any sense and the director added pointless characters which weren't interesting at all. On top of that, none of the characters could act and the annoying soundtrack just made matters worse. Cage plays a pilot who has to deal with the strange situation, whilst controlling a plane and trying to land it safely whilst running out of fuel. Some of the passengers also went missing, so everyone is in a panic, including the crew, which doesn't help matters. The film took me hours to watch because I kept on falling asleep, out of share boredom. There are some scenes that went way over the top, like when the girl is jumping into random vehicles to make a runway for the plane, and the ending was terrible. Basically, I hated the movie and I haven't got a good word to say about it! Terrible!Round-Up: Oh dear! Yet another bad day at the office for Nicolas Cage, who really is struggling to come out of his downhill slump. I bet that Cage can't wait to pay off all his debts so he can start picking some good roles, except for these awful \"made for TV\" films. The sad thing is, Cage has the ability to pull of some good performances, like in Leaving Las Vegas and Lord of War but he has made more bad than good films. Hopefully, he might surprise audiences with an outstanding performance which will bring him back into the limelight but definitely not with this movie. Although I thought that the movie was terrible, it still made a profit at the box office, which is surprising for such an terrible attempt at a fiasco movie.Budget: $16million Worldwide Gross: $20millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/drama/thrillers about a pilot who has to safely land a plane while the world has to deal with the miraculous disappearance of millions of people. 1/10",

            "content": "\"SIT!...DOWN!\"That one line in the middle of the film was the only redeeming part of the movie and the only scene that should have made this Duck Dynasty-approved turd into \"Cage on a Plane\".Now onto the review.Nicholas Cage, along with sexy D-list actresses and Chad Michael \"One-Tree-past-his- prime\" Murray star in possibly one of the worst, if not the most unintentionally hilarious movies I have ever seen this year since the Kellan Lutz stinker \"The Legend of Hercules\". Nicholas Cage stars as Rayford Steele, a dishonest husband and father who ditches his daughter, returning home from college to see her Dad on her birthday, claiming that he was \"called in for work\" when he really was just taking his leggy flight attendant, clichely (is that a word?) played by model Nicky Whelan, to a concert in London where they plan to you-know-what. However, mid-flight, the Rapture happens and everyone starts freaking out, which leads to some very silly character sequences, most notably Jordin Sparks making a statement to the Razzies playing Shasta Carvell, the crazy wife of a New York Jets player, who's daughter is raptured up along with all the kids in the world right next to her. Her part had me blast in laughter as she pulled a gun on everyone on the plane believing that her husband paid someone to take her daughter. Unintentional hilarity ensues. Another part that was quite funny was the God-awful (no pun intended) chemistry between Steele's daughter (Cassi Thomson, who's acting credits include Cop Dog) and the past-his-prime Chad Michael Murray filling in wacko-fundamentalist Kirk Cameron's shoes as Buck Williams, a journalist who is investigating the sudden God craze. Their scene in the coffee shop at the airport was a very laughable scene.\"Can I get you coffee?\" \"I'm waiting on someone\" *dramatic pause* \"Who?\" \"My dad.\"This lame attempt at humor, along with the fact that this opened with cheesy 80's music while showing New York from the skyline gave me a clue that this is, in fact, an unintentional comedy by all means.Finally when they all finally reunite, Buck Williams looks at a burning Manhattan and says possibly the most obvious thing:\"It looks like the end of the world.\"Duh.D-, only because the film was unintentionally hilarious.",

            "content": "Left Behind is a full-length advertisement directed at believers and non-believers of the events of the rapture according to the Bible. The message is simple, reinforce faith and belief of those who believe, as millions of people are scooped up by God during the Rapture. For those who don't believe, they are left behind to reconcile their future, lack of faith, and loss of loved ones.Those who believe will be treated to a movie that reinforces their belief and will be happy that someone covered the topic with a full-length motion picture. Those who don't believe, are not likely to be moved towards belief, as theistic and atheistic belief systems are far too complicated matter to address in a movie with one agenda, get people to believe by scaring them into believing that they will be left behind.Left Behind is stunningly superficial, as all serious discussion on revealed religions require a responsible handling of meta-physics and epistemology. As it fails to take on these serious discussions, because that is not its purpose, we don't know if it is to be taken seriously or whether it's satire. For this reason, Left Behind can only be said to be intellectually irresponsible and cannot serve as a convincing argument for the Rapture. Finally, Nicolas Cage's performance is almost comical at times, and his conversion to believer, unconvincing.Given the times in which we are living, I would love to see a serious movie on the topic of the Rapture. Perhaps Tom Hanks and Ron Howard might have treated the subject matter with greater respect. Left behind should be left alone.",

Whatever your beliefs are (and \"concerns\" are being stated early on), it will be hard to overlook the clich\u00e9s and like this movie for what it tries to do.

Nick cage is a pilot with a bad sense of humor who's having an affair, that's all you'll know about him by the end of the movie. There's also nick cage's daughter, who's.........nick cage's daughter. Yeah, that's pretty much her only personality trait. And there's nick cage's wife, who's, you guessed it: nick cage's wife. Oh and a good christian. So this movie is about the rapture, but my god do they drag it out before the rapture finally happens. So after like.. way too long, the rapture FINALLY happens. So nick cage's daughter is in a mall when it happens with her kid brother, who gets raptured. Now people have disappeared, their clothes and personal property are lying on the ground. But people are still robbing each other!?!?!? JUST PICK UP WHAT'S ON THE GROUND!!! Anyways, nick cage is in the air with his passenger plane and what do you know...his plane happens to be on an EXACT collision course with some other plane....can you believe it!? Because I certainly can't. So nick cage has all kinds of plane problems to deal with, but meanwhile, passengers have disappeared!!!??? Oh no, what is happening!?!? Why are all the characters clueless about the rapture because for the audience it was evident that the rapture was going to happen from the first minute. So why are they treating it as of the audience doesn't know what's going on either, by dragging out the plot so long before letting the characters find out what's happening. Also, at this point nothing happens in the movie. It's just nick cage's daughter trying to get home, just.walking between chaos. She doesn't encounter anyone interesting, doesn't do anything interesting...... so back to nick cage. He's......still in a plane...trying to figure out what's happening. There's this journalist guy on the plane who's trying to comfort people and explain things......so there some screentime that's filled with that.....and than nick cage's daughter arrives home and finds out that her mother has been raptured, wow. What a shocker. So nick cage gets some more plane problems and finds out that the rapture is happening.......FINALLY. He has to make an emergency landing and everyone survives woohoo. So he meets up with his daughter and they look at the city burning in the distance. Nick cage's daughter than says: \"It's only the beginning.\" NO IT'S NOT. IT IS THE ENDING, THANK GOD!\nTHE ENDING OF A MOVIE THAT WAS ACTUALLY 15 MINUTES LONG BUT WAS DRAGGED OUT TO THE POINT IT COULD BE A CONTESTANT ON RUPAUL.\nWHAT A PIECE OF STEAMING GARBAGE.",

Some kind of apocalypse + Cage Rage? That's a recipe for some absolute comedic gold! But no. Oh, was I ever mistaken. The writing/acting was uncomfortably bad. Since the idea of the film was that people were getting raptured, the characters were written in very polar ways. That is to say, the innocents were either children or childlike, asexual, religious adults while the sinners were generally atheists, thieves, drug addicts, promiscuous, or absurdly violent at the slightest provocation. I think we can all agree that characters in genre films are often stereotypes, but this takes it to an uncomfortable and somewhat ridiculous level. As an example, Chloe is randomly robbed by two dudes on a motorcycle as she walks home, because hey! Sinners gonna sin! I'd also like to point out how stupid the characters are. People literally vanish in an instant, leaving their clothes behind in a heap, yet they think maybe they just went somewhere else? Naked? On their own two feet? Yeah, I don't think so. Obviously when something like that happens, the rapture isn't the *first* thing that would come to mind for a rational person - however, I'd definitely be more likely to believe that they were killed or something than that they somehow got out of their clothes and out of my sight in the blink of an eye. It takes until pretty much the last 20 minutes or so of the film for anyone to actually put two and two together. It's beyond unbelievable that people could be that dumb. Especially the ones in the airplane, because seriously, where exactly can one hide thousands of feet up in the air in a metal tube? Another complaint I had with the film was the music. It felt like whoever make those song choices was trained by the music person from the room. I just... I can't even list everything that was wrong with this film. It's such a waste of two hours to watch. Just do yourself and anyone you had planned to watch this with a favour, and catch another Cage flick.",

            "content": "The term \"worst ever\" is once again very exaggerated in these review pages. The ratings are so low that curiosity compelled me to watch it. I expected a disaster. It isn't. It's about a disaster. More precisely, it's a movie that can't choose between being a serious plane disaster story or a comedy. Anyway, it's just a badly written piece. A bad movie per se, therefore an average movie by Hollowood standards.The theme is the rapture, a rather common subject in contemporary Christian American mythology. It makes for a good premise, and a welcome change from the ever popular ghosts, vampires devils, and other classics of superstition.Think encounter of the 4th kind, i.e., alien abductions, except that we'll never know why the bodies are taken. I expected the (off-screen) death of millions of people, since they're supposed to go to some heaven. Instead, a powerful bully cast the Dungeons & Dragons 6th-level magic spell \"Teleport Without Clothes\" on them. The \"Mass\" version. Now that augurates an orgy of epic proportions, but nothing epic is to be seen in Left Behind. Instead we have dwarf jokes, plus a good amount of involuntary comedy - the main reason why it is indeed a bad movie.The story left me thinking, but probably not the way the writers intended me to. For example, I believe all Christian air-pilots will lose their jobs now, and religion will be thoroughly checked for new applicants. And that is not the only job in which people are pretending to take responsibilities, when in fact they believe they could disappear any moment, dropping things on our heads, leaving nuclear plants unattended, and whatnot.I've got plenty more, but most people don't read long reviews anyway. So, Left Behind is not good enough to recommend watching, but if you really need to make your own opinion, know that at least it's not a snore-fest. It's just very, very cheesy.",

Is the xtian rapture thing?So, I expected a much more in your face preachy xtian movie, but it mentions the religious aspect just a few times, and not very forcefully. The movie is way more about the plane almost crashing than anything else. The 2016 version is way worse, paranoid and ReichWing.The biggest question of the movie remains unanswered: Do the clothes that are left behind include underwear? If they do, does that mean that xtians are going to heaven/purgatory ....COMPLETELY NAKED???? That seems kind of perverse.For a supposed xtian movie it has a lot of cleavage shots with jiggly breasts of their female lead, Cassi Thompson. She's Australian. Even without the religious mumbo-jumbo it's just a low budget movie with a poor script and hardly any production value. How they got the three main protagonists to sign for this crap is the real mystery, but if anything, it underlines the plummeting career of Cage.3/10 The Melancholic Alcoholic.",

            "content": "Too many years have passed since Adaptation, Nicholas Cage's last good film and he's got very little tread left in the tires. What was once a promising acting career with great flicks like Raising Arizona, Red Rock West, Wild at Heart, the Rock, and Leaving Las Vegas has dissolved into him doing any part so long as the check clears. That being said the rest of the movies is a far bigger disaster than Cage's downward spiral. Left Behind is to Christians as what Sweet Sweetback's Baaaaaaaaadass song was for African-Americans: A death-filled revenge fantasy. Tim LaHaye wrote this as a cathartic means of having the evil non-Christians suffer in his book by virtue of disasters of a biblical scale and man does it ooze with cheap, simplistic ideological zeal. Anyone who doesn't believe in the right wing fundamentalist version of the Christian God and doesn't religiously watch the 700 Club and vote Santorum then there's a place in the lake of fire for you. It's kind of like the Chris Kyle version of Christianity where he believes that he's holy and good and anyone who doesn't agree with his narrow view deserves to die. It's also too inconvenient for the author to spend more time with the concept of the rapture. Is is right that non-Christian people who lived their lives with virtue and humility deserve to be left to die and burn in hell? Is if fair that a man who cheated on his wife once is now forever cast into eternal flames? Is it fair that scientists, intellectuals, the educated elite who strive for truth are to be punished for believing in what's rational and observable? Also, what about the saved? If only having a simplistic belief in god is a way to the promised land then why are murderers who accept Jesus after the fact get to go to heaven when the family members of their victims are meant to wander the earth because they stopped believing in god after said murder? Then there's the case of Catholic priests who couldn't keep their hands to themselves and their enablers... Maybe it's unfair to judge the movie in trying to fully flesh out its own ideology, but it should at least try to entertain and provide good relatable characters. Instead it meanders with a predictable storyline about a distressed plane and mild chaos on the streets. Seriously, it's as boring as a sermon you've heard before. It's also hilarious that those 'left behind' are idiotic stock characters who have less dimension than a Walking Dead extra. You have the liberal reporter, the Eurotrash junkie, the Asian science guy (who has maybe a third grade comprehension of science), the wayward college daughter, the Muslism guy who is most likely played by a Puerto Rican, the rich Texan, and the hateful midget. Well, okay, credit where credit's due I'll give them props for hiring Verne Troyer for a role. Regardless, all of them apparently have no clue about the rapture even though you'd be surprised how many Atheists can quote scripture since tons of them were raised by Bible-thumping parents and then left the faith. Even Christians are hollowly portrayed, Lea Thompson is dead eyed and annoying. In the end, this movie does a disservice to everyone, from Christians who want something wholesome they can enjoy to anyone else who just wants to be entertained. As for me, I don't care who makes the movie, just make it good or don't be surprised when your flick winds up at the bottom of the tomato-meter, played only late night on a local CW station, or featured on Rifftrax.",

The acting is horrible, the directing doesn't exist, the special effects are left overs from The Polar Express, and I hated every single character. When I first looked on the back of this movie I saw a good review from Willie Robertson from Duck Dynasty. Why would I trust them? The opening lines of dialog made a Lifetime or ABC Family movie look like Tarentino quality writing. This isn't even good as a TV movie. The soundtrack is the worst, when Nicholas Cage went to board the plane it played a banjo. The little brother gave the worst performance in this movie. I was mad that the rapture didn't happen till 30 minuets in, I was almost about to turn it off. When the rapture does happen, it looks like hundreds of people disappeared instead of millions. I almost forgot the product placement, it is everywhere! One scene I was scared they where going to do something awful, there was a preacher at the church. I thought they where going to say he well, if you watch the news you'll know what I'm talking about. Tank god they didn't do that, but then he says he didn't believe in god. What made me mad was when they said every child is gone. So you are saying that every child is good? Well that is wrong. There are kids who do drugs, murder, and even say they don't believe in god, so how come all them get to go? I am mad how the ending sets up for a sequel, A SEQUEL for this awful movie?

            "review_title": "Apocalypse No",
            "content": "Woefully under-budgeted new film version of the 20 year old best-selling Christian Apocalypse book series by Tim Lahaye & Jerry Jenkins (although some fans are already strongly protesting that very little of the books is contained at all here) reconfirms the frustratingly insular nature of the \"Contemporary Religious Film\" genre: no personal artistic or thematic vision, characters coming off as rather smarmy (almost as if the film's determinedly comfortable upper-middle-class viewpoint regarding the terrors of Armageddon was dramatized on the Lifetime or Hallmark cable TV channels), and its increasingly labyrinth insistence on 'exploring' each trapped character for several interruptable talky minutes (the 'businessman', the 'Middle Easterner', etc.). The film's broken, opportunistic dramaturgy centers around the dysfunctional relationship between airline pilot Rayford Steele (Nicolas Cage), his adult estranged daughter Chloe (Cassi Thomson), and further strained by the earnest spiritual zeal of Steele's newly Christianized ex-wife Irene (Lea Thompson). Each is adequately introduced but as Steele's scheduled Trans-Atlantic passenger flight is suddenly interrupted by the worldwide Rapture described in the Book of Revelations, the film-\u2014probably due to a lack of budget cancelling out the ability to cut away to anything--begins a strange stop/start episodic dragging involving the actors that continues throughout the somewhat bipolar Act II; Chloe\u2014after witnessing a couple hundred extras running madly around a shopping mall parking lot to indicate world chaos--is so distanced from the other characters while wandering throughout the city it is almost as if the filmmakers were trying to film a female version of Richard Matheson's book \"I Am Legend,\" while up above somewhere Steele swerves between tearfully trying to reach Chloe by cell phone or giving increasingly tired speeches to his rather grimy set of passengers. Cage's adequate medium-star wattage (he and Thompson almost seem to come from another era) , combined with the perhaps-unintentional stunt casting (Olympian Lolo Jones as an airline ticket agent, American Idol contestant Jordin Sparks as a distressed mother-with-a-gun) and regional dinner-theater level actor hires combine as well as can be expected. Obviously, Nicolas Cage can be an acquired taste and those campily hoping that Cage would here apply some of his previous excesses as seen in such test-pilot crashes as VAMPIRE'S KISS or PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED are bound to be disappointed. He is not a literary actor (which would make his agreement with this type of mass market fiction perfectly understandable) but has always made an earnest, even goofy attempt to understand the oddity or severe crutch of his characters (from MOONSTRUCK to the bottled rage of his LEAVING LAS VEGAS), and his Rayford Steele here\u2014although light years removed from what the novel's more conventional, Robert Redford/George Clooney-type characterization of Steele probably originally intended--is workably vulnerable and honest in trying to deal with both his daughter and his passengers in a nightmarish situation. But it is hard to determine why the filmmakers\u2014although it's done unobtrusively\u2014keep jamming the book's characters together in such listless combinations (a major character of the book, a controversial national TV journalist and strong romantic foil for Chloe named Buck Williams, played by 'One Tree Hill's Chad Michael Murray, comes off more like a love-struck puppy who continually keeps fading into the airplane upholstery; the character is included in the film's last shot as if the filmmakers were genuinely frightened we wouldn't remember him). This new incarnation of the book has taken several years to be put together\u2014British director/veteran stunt arranger Vic Armstrong was signed two years ago\u2014but it almost appears as if the time was used by the producers to erase any hint of an auteur. Armstrong's scenes are decisively staged individually but--strung together using the script's milky characters and apolitical stance (there is no explanation of what happened to either the NSA, the US military, air marshals or any local law enforcement)--the film has a murky, amorphous forward propulsion that cancels out the potential subliminal terror the situation was striving for (achieved in the antichrist THE OMEN film trilogy and much more cheaply in the 1970s Christian film market THIEF IN THE NIGHT trilogy). Some understandably have already written the results off with ridicule but as it unspooled\u2014even with its admitted faults\u2014I had to admit it has a disarmingly sincere, humorously tilted core about the spontaneous meetings with strangers and interpersonal conflicts of this life, and it hesitates to become too obviously 'preachy' on implied standards of spirituality. The film at least has a professional look provided by Clint Eastwood's former cameraman Jack Green and Robert Altman's son Stephen Altman as art director, and the stunt-/special effects-heavy climax, as befitting one supervised by a stunt coordinator like Armstrong, is not bad considering his lack of resources. The LEFT BEHIND movie series will probably manage one more sequel before either stopping completely or going the 'straight to DVD' route but its chatty brightness, threadbare visual poignancy, and clumsy sincerity is worth a conditional look for those who appreciate modest, adequately put-together works of imaginative faith.",

Turns out this is a world-wide happening. And, of course, panic grips most people. To be honest, this is a little over the top. When people start disappearing no one cries out something about The Rapture. No, Hollywood has panic spread throughout as it makes for better action. The dialogues of the passengers on the plane were angry, and for the most part lame and believe the Captain has all the answers as they charge to the cockpit. Jordin Sparks as a passenger who just lost her son, acted wildly over the top. Can't blame her, blame the writers of this somewhat over the top movie. Captain Steele and photo Journalist Buck Williams (Chad Michael Murray) are the only ones who act reasonably in this crisis, but wait there's a plane heading on a direct line toward them and Captain Steele sees that no one is piloting that plane. Looks like things are going to get worse. This movie makes you feel as though there is no God and most everyone is an Atheist and no one has any clue about The Rapture. It takes quite a while for the people to be hit over the head and finally come to believe, well, maybe there is a God and what do we do now? The ending is really over the top as Steele's daughter Chloe (Cassi Thomson) does her best to clear a runway so the plane can land. She even drives a Steamroller. I wouldn't have a clue as to how to start one. (and who leaves the keys in one?) But to be fair these are exciting scenes and even I was on the edge of my seat helping Cassie start that steamroller to clear a path. Hey, when in Rome, help out. Exciting, but still over the top.Sadly, it was the dialogues and some bad acting by some that didn't make this the success it could have been. Since I am a big Nicolas Cage fan he did good.

It's as if the budget only allowed a maximum of three takes per scene. There is nothing and I mean nothing that is memorable about this movie.What I can not believe is the actors such as Nicholas Cage, Lea Thompson and others lent their names to this idiotic piece of trash.It's not that it is a religious movie, it's that every one of these types of movies, that have the potential to be extremely good because of the subject matter are really stupid.If I could, I would give this a minus ten.",

            "content": "Having seen all the Left Behind films with Kirk Cameron I was wondering why someone decided to remake it so soon. The answer is that this film is merely an extended part of the first film when the Rapture occurs. It concentrates on pilot Nicholas Cage in the role originally played by Brad Johnson bringing in a plane with a lot of panicky passengers as people seem to vanish as they are on the ground right in front of their eyes.Chad Michael Murray plays the Cameron role of the investigative reporter and I have to tell you I accepted him far more than the former Michael Seaver of Growing Pains. All the theology the anti-Christ and how both Johnson and Cameron become part of a group of conspirators thwarting his ambitions is all jettisoned. The action switches from the plane to the ground as Cage's wife Lea Thompson and young son get caught up in the Rapture. His daughter is busy looking for a landing spot for his 747 as the airports are in a state of panic. The daughter is played by Australian actress Cassie Thomson and she is suitably panic stricken, but up to the job.Lest the audience think that this is a Christian end times film we have a Moslem character as one of the plane passengers. I doubt many Moslems got to see it in any event.Stripped of most of the end times theology this Left Behind film is just Nicholas Cage bringing in an airplane under extremely hazardous and unusual flying conditions. You've seen it all before in the Airport films.",

To make matters worse the acting was horrible, no special effects, really bad visuals, pointless plot, no character development, everything was bad about this movie.

How anyone was able to raise money for a remake is beyond me. Cage has so much makeup on he looks like a Geshia Girl. The production values are less than a bad Lifetime movie and the special effects appear to have been done by a sixth grader on his 1st generation Ipad. Cage's career has been in the gutter for years now, and that is to bad, for someone to go from costarring with Cher to this is really sad. Do not waste your time on this, I beg you.

This movie is full of odd quirks, contradictions, and just plain lousy film making. If I didn't have to bear the embarrassment of trying to explain to the theater manager why I was asking for my $10 admission returned I would have asked for it. Nicolas Cage will never be accused of under acting a scene or a role. Also, someone should remind him that a pause between lines isn't a bad thing.

At least this time their reviews don't dwell on the fact that, yeah, the plot left some people behind, but the reviewers still seem afraid to admit there are some wonderful aspects to this movie. This is the first movie that has portrayed most atheists as likable and only one as intolerable, to the point that he annoys the others. I apologize to little people for this suggestion, but I think the size of the petty atheist in this movie was intended to symbolize the insignificance the movie makers (and most people) think of petty people who carry a chip on their shoulder because they are different, or petty atheists who only argue with scoffing. The college age girl, who we presume was raised atheist, is so sweet that I must admit I've never met an atheist college kid who was quite that sweet. This girl, presumably raised atheist, is trying to single-handedly hold together her family. I wanted to cry for her when Cage read her message in the ticket envelope: \"this is the saddest day of my life\". It's clever (and endearing) that the only reason she argues about religion with her mother is because it is chasing her father away, and that she still tries to hide any symptoms of family conflict (including any disrespect of her mother) from her little brother. Given the circumstances, I did figure suicide was unlikely for anyone to risk, so that part struck me as unrealistic. However, the special effects were excellent, bringing you into the anxiety. Nicholas Cage has a lot to think about, and quick thinking to do, when he discovers that his wife was correct all along, and he has been left behind with his daughter and his fling (who is also an \"innocent\" atheist, unaware he is married).Another clever aspect is how the boy points out that their father thinks the pastor is \"washing Mom's brain\" and that, sure enough, we discover that their mother's pastor doesn't personally believe what he is preaching. It is likely that skepticism that the father picked up on. He thought her pastor was a con artist. But I also liked how, when the pastor explains the situation to the daughter, she responds with \"the God my mother told me about would never do that!\" Apparently, her mother was so desperate to get the girl to convert that she candy coated the religion. I appreciated the Bible verse at the end reminding Christians that nobody knows when the end times are. I think this verse can help protect Christians from fraudsters trying to steal their money by claiming they know. This movie had a great deal of emotion and sweet sentiment, and the atheists on the plane debating their theories regarding their predicament was funny. Admittedly, I'd probably do that, but I wouldn't be the kind that scoffs at everyone else. Even I've noticed that some atheists answer every theory with \"Come on! Can you believe this guy?\"",

Low budget, poor effects, dialog, and daytime soap acting are not the only plagues upon this film.I am not here to preach about various religious beliefs or the beliefs of atheists. I know for a fact, not all Christians believe or promote the idea of a rapture. There are many views among Christians regarding the rapture which is never mentioned in the Bible. The older Christian denominations do not believe that a group of people is left behind on earth. This is a fairy-tale, only told by the evangelistic movement. But I can suspend my disbelief for some good fiction any day. However this is not good fiction. It is at best a disaster movie with a Christian candy wrapper on it. Take away the rapture and toss in the \"alien abduction theory\" and you have the same poorly made disaster film. The movie has no message or hidden agenda or meaning, other than to make some money.Some of these reviews said it was promoting religion, but not once was anyone told what must be done to become a Christian. I found the hospital scene very curious saying that 100% of all the children were taken. Catholics and various other religions believe even as a child we are born into sin. It amazed me that no children were left behind. They tacked on a 17 and under clause in there. In my opinion, the movie was created to generate profits not convert anyone.This is not the first stinker that was funded by a religious movement. \"Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959)\" and \"The Jupiter Menace (1983)\" was also created by them.",

            "content": "I am not \"Christian\" per se, so this review is not about the religious content. I was raised Christian and a few years ago I stumbled onto the Left Behind book series and devoured them. Almost all of the books were incredible with vivid characters and action scenes and a living breathing post-Apocalytpic world with a very heavy Christian message and it worked!! I actually very much enjoyed the first two Kirk Cameron films from a few years ago because they understood the original content of the books and translated them very well. The third film was not as good because they took it in a completely different direction and missed the point of why we love the book series. However, compared to this film that third one was a masterpiece. I was actually cautiously optimistic about a big screen reboot of Left Behind even starring Nicholas Cage which was strange to me but I even thought he wasn't bad casting for the role of hero Rayford Steele. The problem is that whomever wrote this horribly awful script and whoever directed this film either didn't even glance at the source material or didn't care. They try to blatantly force the Christian message in there but turning the story into a air-disaster film which makes little sense. The Left Behind book series didn't take place in an airplane. The first book explored the world after the rapture, showed the initial rise of one of the best villains I've ever read (Nicholae Carpathia) and introduced you the characters you would come to adore. This film did literally none of that. It was torture at times to watch. The entire thing felt forced and contrived with little purpose. They took what should have been one opening scene and dragged it into a two hour film.The reason I am giving this film a four is because of the cast. I actually think for the most part the casting wasn't bad at all. I think almost everyone could have given decent performances and fit their roles well if they had something other than this horribly awful script. Nicholas Cage is fine as Rayford Steele. He holds the cast together well enough. If he had been given the same sort of depth as the book gave Rayford Steele, he may have pulled it off. Cassi Thompson actually fit my idea of Chloe Steele quite well. She gets a lot of emotional moments and she actually plays it pretty good. There are a few scenes where she unfortunately comes across as campy but its hard not to with what she's given. Chad Michael Murray could have also made a perfectly acceptable Buck Williams. I actually think he and Thompson could have had good chemistry moving forward since the romance between Buck and Chloe is a huge driving force in the book series. Murray also gets the best character in the film I thought because he actually has some back bone and gets some decent scenes and he is the only one who never gets a \"silly\" line or scene. Nicky Whelan likely could have made a good Hattie but she is given literally nothing to work with so she's just sort of there but given that she does alright. Lea Thompson is completely mis-used and looks stunned and forced in all her scenes. Her character was actually not necessary and this should have started right at the rapture.I don't know where director Vic Armstrong came from outside of the fact that he has worked on some great films as stunt co-coordinator. He also directed some episodes of Young Indiana Jones and then 14 years later comes out to direct this. He obviously couldn't care less about the source material or the fans and that very effectively killed this movie and killed the potential franchise. I do believe the Left Behind books have a big enough following that in the right skilled hands who cared about what direction it was taking...this could have been great but now it never will be...its dead. Even Christians hate it because the message is so sparingly used and forced. Even on a low budget and starring \"B-Actors\" the original Left Behind films were a million miles superior to this. I could list all day why they were better and I am not even referring to the Christian message. This is a great series that was killed by this horrible movie. It would have to be pretty bad for me to not add it to my collection because I love the book series so much but...I won't be spending money on this junk. 4/10",

The film depicted normal people suddenly turning into animals and criminals, as if the only thing holding sanity in check is some \"omnipresence\" which suddenly vacated everyone's skulls. While watching Cage's daughter running through the streets of the city in a panic, the background roads and highways depicted normality - a complete paradox to the supposed plot that the \"world was coming to an end\". It makes one wonder who is setting the bar for the film industry these days - because this was low. It's too bad because Cage deserves a better shot than this - he usually does good stuff. I'm sorry - I don't usually critique bad films, and I am a very tolerant person and I truly appreciate the film industry - but this had to be said.",

            "content": "**Warning! Spoiler Information Inside**OK this will be longer than usual. Out of sheer fascination that Nicholas Cage would do such a role , I decided to catch this film on Netflix. Also, for clarification I did in fact read the first two books of this series around their release time owing to what seemed to be an almost moth to the flame obsession over it by the religious community. this review will deal with the religious aspect and the film production aspect in separate terms.First the religious,I get it , Hollywood and indeed the average secular consumer of film has through either overt or subtle statement declared that the area of our spirituality being discussed is not too welcome. Drawing on the fact that film is a culture of individual expression you cannot be surprised at the cultural behavior. However , authors enjoy prerogative when targeting their audiences.I will not personally comment on the internal religious motivations of this series authors Jerry B. Jenkins and Tim La Haye. Look it is a well known religious sentiment that use of the bible that results in profit is ..shaky at best with God. I would not put my self in that spot , but as I said writers have prerogative. These two authors decided for whatever reason that the end times material was a great background for their story. Just as North Korea is not going to tell me I can only watch film it approves of (The Interview) the same is true for activist groups.Enough of the Personal Opinions , The film itself came in one notch down before production , for those of you who rail that this film is preachy I encourage you to temper that by screening Left Behind (2000), the same series filmed by Actor and Christian Activist Kirk Cameron (yeah , the guy from Growing Pains). A hour of that film and you will have a new opinion of this one. What is different. The movie is updated by it's script writers to a modern context, smart phones debuted after left behind was published. The Placing of Nicholas Cage as Ray Steele is nothing short of brilliance. I am not saying that he acted brilliantly , I am saying that he was the right (and possibly only) actor to be able to pull this off. Cage's acceptance of almost any role has been joked about and cracked on for a while and it's true he is fairly open on lead roles , Left Behind should show movie fans why Nicholas Cage is a good actor over all. His one strength is that no matter the subtext of the character he is able to deftly reach the core of said character on the mark every single time. He has made a career of it in fact.The production value of this film is Average , it did suffer low finance and stands at a small loss to date. Director Vic Armstrong was in his sophomore outing in feature film , Having directed only Army of One (1993) for movie screens prior. Some of the effects are hampered by this low budget clearly. people being pulled to heaven looked more stylish in This Is The End (2013), than in this film.Reviewing film is the process of reviewing a presented product or idea , And yes bias on the individual viewers level is a acceptable because it is a individual end use product , but when reviewing one must consider that some may not have seen the film and should carefully avoid discouragement based on personal opinion. I found the movie to be an average view not one I regret but maybe not one ill see over and over again. Most importantly I would say watch it and decide for yourself.Three Stars (of 5).",

            "content": "WARNING: Conatins heavy spoilers about the plot and basically everything. But you're not gonna watch this anyway, are you? (Please don't)I got this movie expecting it too be some cheesy B-film with bad production values, about the end of humanity. What I got was much worse.So the movie begins with some people talking about an earthquake or something. Then Cage's wife suddenly starts to discuss the bible without reason. And that's a big problem in this piece of sh*t called \"movie\". The writing would be bearable if it wasn't for the unmotivated lines about Jesus, God and other religious nonsense that they try to force upon the viewers. I think that there's like 15 deeply religious scenes, where they either zoom in on a bible (without reason), a random Christian symbol or where the characters suddenly starts to discuss God (also that without reason, except for in like one scene).The acting is decent for a B-movie, but Cage (who plays a pilot by the way) doesn't get a mental breakdown, so what's the point of having him? The effects are also decent (for a B-movie).So, the \"disaster\" happens when people suddenly disappears and leaves all their clothes in pile, except their underwear, which they apparently gets to keep. Most the people that are \"left behind\" gets really panicked and starts too scream things like \"Where's ma BABIESSS!?!!?\". (Yes, one woman on the plane seriously did that)A couple people are like \"I understand\", but don't care to explain what they understand, until they've waited like 6 hours. At the end they explain that the people that disappeared went to heaven, and that dark times are coming and some bullsh*t like that.So after watching this movie, there's a couple weird things that I'd like to get answered:1. How the *!#% did a woman bring a pistol aboard the plane!? 2. How the *!#% did another woman bring drugs aboard the plane!? 3. Where's the second class passengers on the plane? The movie just focuses on the 1st class, and the air hostess does never go outside the cockpit and the 1st class section. A bit discriminating, maybe? 4. Why the *!#% did Cage decide to land on the runway that was under construction with like a thousand obstacles? I think that the JFK- airport has lots of runways that are much better alternatives. 5. Why didn't Cage get contact with the ATM!? He tried contacting them like 20 times during a period of 6 hours or something, so a) How could everyone in the ATM disappear when like 30 % of the total amount of people in the movie did. It's not very likely that everyone would get \"accepted by God\" or whatever, and b) Why didn't anyone send some random guy to take contact with the air traffic? It just doesn't make any sense. 6. Did they expect that anyone would feel like becoming a Christian after watching this? I temporarily disliked Christianity even more when watching this. 7. How much money did Nicolas Cage get to be an actor in this sh*t? 8. Why did this movie focus on like the least interesting stuff? Wouldn't it be more interesting if it focused on the government or something, instead of a plane? Seriously!",

If not, FUNNIER than any comedy you could ever see. There is many messed up stereo typical things in the movie though. For example, they added a little person in the movie on the plane possibly for comedic reasons, but was just really messed up. At the end of the movie, they pushed the little person off the plane and showed him bounce and flop off the rescue blow up. Again, REALLY funny, but extremely stereo typical against midgets, Muslims, drug addicts, tattooed men, and wealthy people.

            "content": "I truly believe there tends to be some anti-Christian prejudice in Hollywood. Having said that, I can assure you this movie does not have a 2% on Rotten Tomatoes because of the Christian themes. Even the film's target Christian audience despise this movie from what I've read. The sad thing is it's not even fun bad and it should be with Academy Award winner Nicolas Cage in the starring role. The film could use some bees. Cage stars as pilot and family man Rayford Steele, which is the greatest name I've ever seen in a movie since Dirk Diggler in \"Boogie Nights\". In the beginning he plans on having an affair with a sexy blonde stewardess due to the strife between him and his Born Again wife (Lea Thompson, remember her from \"Back to the Future\"?), whom we never see together in the movie. Before he boards the plane, he is confronted by his non-believing daughter, who later has a Meet Cute with International Correspondent Buck Williams (Chad Michael Murray). The first half of the movie is supposed to be \"character development\" though not much character is actually developed. We just find out who's a Christian and who's not. When the rapture does happen, chaos ensues both on the plane and on Earth or as much chaos as the budget would allow. With the film's $16 million budget it is pretty clear that most of that went to Cage's salary. The movie is supposed to take place in New York and it looks like it was filmed anywhere but New York (it was filmed in Louisiana). The rapture is a fascinating event that should result in a Roland Emmerich-like spectacle of frenzy. We get scenes like a car crashing into a mall and a small plane falling and crashing into a car. However, for the most part it's just a bunch of extras running around who were probably told \"Please scream and run around in circles!\" As for chaos on the plane, do they give out Razzies for CGI? The interior of the plane does not look like it would fit the exterior. The sets are so unconvincing I half expected some guy to pop in the cockpit and say \"I just want to tell you both 'Good Luck', we're all counting on you\". The movie essentially takes what could have been an interesting premise for an action and turns it into a cheap airplane flick like the ones \"Airplane\" spoofed. We get a handful of clich\u00e9s like Cage looking at a photo of his family (even that looks horribly photo-shopped). We also get terrible comic relief like random confrontations between a Muslim man and a dwarf. There's also a climax that I choose not to reveal but it is absurd and ridiculous. Although apparently the daughter can ride a motorcycle without a helmet and operate complex machinery without any difficulty.The real problem with this film is that it's not even enjoyably bad. It's just boring. Nicolas Cage is so restrained here, he's not even having fun. Much of the movie's plot is just the characters trying to figure out what happened, which isn't fun because we the audience already knows what happened. The movie isn't even subtle about it, we see the clothes and possession of those who were called up, one having a planner with \"BIBLE STUDY\" written on it. This is director Vic Armstrong's second film, and the first in over two decades. Despite this he has one of the more impressive resumes in Hollywood. As a famous stunt man he did many of the stunts in the Indiana Jones movies along with others like \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" in the classic skiing scene. However a competent director he is not. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against wide-released movies aimed at a Christian audience. However I believe Christians deserve much better than this.",

Likewise, people who are expecting a movie that is \"by the book\" may also be disappointed since this movie doesn't even cover half of the first book. So, best to leave your expectations at home and go watch the movie without them. Left Behind is definitely character driven rather than special effects driven, and although the special effects in this movie were good (but not great), I more enjoyed watching the characters meet and learn about each other and develop genuine relationships in the middle of a very intense and scary situation. I walked out of the theater looking forward to watching the next movie as the rest of the story unfolds and the character relationships deepen. Oh, and I liked Chad Michael Murphy in the role of Cameron \"Buck\" Williams. He played it quite believably well (no offense intended to Kirk Cameron!) and was my favorite. The only actor I didn't quite get into so much was Nicky Whelan. Although she's a good actress, she just didn't quite seem to me to be a good fit for the role of Hattie Durham. She was definitely not on the same level as Nicolas Cage (Ray Steele) and Cassi Thomson (Chloe Steele), who both did a much better job and were much more believable. I enjoyed them both very much.",

And Nic Cage-????- after a half decade of terrible direct-to-video B- action movies you redeem yourself with a couple good films- \"The Frozen Ground\" and \"Joe\", and then you decide to star in THIS movie-??? A- hem!...",

            "review_title": "Not Left Behind",
            "content": "I am going to make an honest attempt to do what most of the movie critics are not doing and that is to set aside my own personal bias and prejudices and review this film as objectively as possible in comparing it to other like movies that I have seen (without actually mentioning those movies). In that light, then I will review the quality of the acting, the quality of the production, and the quality of the screenplay itself as it compares to the original book series which made the #1 New York Times best seller list and has sold 63+ million copies to date. Because these prophetic events have not taken place yet I will use the same tact that book series authors Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins have taken and treat the subject as science fiction, which is how the movie is billed besides action, adventure, fantasy, and thriller.Nicolas Cage (Rayford Steele) and Leah Tompson (Irene Steele) were the only two actors that I really had a lot of previous familiarity with, though Gary Grubbs (Dennis) and Martin Klebba (Melvin Weir) stood out as well in my memory from their previous cinema and television roles. The other main actors are probably more recognized by the younger generations behind me and they would include Chad Michael Murray (Buck Williams) who mainly did movies and Nicky Whelan (Hattie Durham) and Cassi Thomson (Chloe Steele) who did mainly TV roles. For the actors who I am familiar with, I thought they played their roles in a very compelling way on or above par with their previous roles. Cage, the top-billed star of Left Behind, was very convincing in his demeanor before and after the Rapture and left me being drawn into his character instead of simply watching a detached actor and I can say the same for Tompson as well. All the main actors did well and garnered my mental and emotional attention. The production was made on a moderate budget ($15M) and it was reflected in the quality of the audio and selection of background music, both of which weren't bad but could have been improved upon for this audiophile. The rest of the production was done quite well all things considered and I really liked the panicked rioters, crash scenes of driverless/pilotless vehicles and planes and the depiction of the widespread chaos, terror, and despair of humanity left behind after the Rapture along with the personal artifacts (i.e. clothes and jewelry, one scene particularly mind-bending) belonging to about a third of their former members, the only evidence of their pre-Rapture existence. Pretty stunning and thought-provoking when you consider it. How did the movie compare with the books? Well, when you realize that this just touched on the first of 12 books (not counting the 4 prequels published later) the producers are definitely going to have to keep this franchise going or there will be a lot of frustrated viewers including me, especially the way the movie ended. Moreover, as with most movies produced from books, a lot will be cut out and sometimes rearranged and Left Behind was no exception, though the screenplay seemed pretty seamless and linear with a couple of exceptions. As science fiction, the storyline was pretty convincing and put together in a logical way from scene to scene with different parts and or characters panning out and occurring simultaneously. Nevertheless, it was still comprehensible and made for a pretty good story. One final word, and I will admit to being biased at this point. I have been promoting this movie for about a month now and my evangelical world-view embraces the eventual apocalyptic drama that Left Behind attempts to depict. You can ignore the movie critics and negative one-star reviewers for this simple reason. Faith-based movies are a direct affront to atheists, some agnostics, and theological liberals and when you read their reviews, their negative bias comes out loud and clear. It's not the quality of the production they have a problem with, but the message contained therein and they are offended by it. It is the same pattern over and over again towards faith-based movies. The one-star critics and their irrational hate-based triads and the 10-star faithful, who are somewhat just as irrational in their loyalty towards these movies whether they are really any good or not. Left Behind in my opinion was a good medium budget production on par with the majority of the films I've seen. It was a satisfying movie for me and will buy the Blu-Ray (or DVD) when it comes out.",

I'm surprised I got as far into it as I did, although after working for more than half a decade in a contact centre, my patience level is pretty high. The story is crap, the writing is crap, the acting is crap, and if this is the kind of crapola Nick Cage is taking on, he should retire forever. Lea Thompson could have made it the rest of her life on Lorraine McFly money without doing this piece of trash. I didn't pay anything other than my subscription to Netflix for this, but somehow I feel utterly raped of my time and actually feel slightly dumber than I was, and should be monetarily compensated for my loss.

Why is it most every movie involving Christians always makes them out to be crazy lunatics? Is this what movie watchers want to see? If you want to show a flick about \"The Rapture\" and make it out to be a disaster flick, then it wouldn't hurt to give a little bit of a history lesson to help explain what the heck is going on. Back it up with Bible scriptures not just scenes of planes and cars crashing, people running everywhere and pure chaos. Small roles from Lea Thompson (from the 80's Back to the Future and All The Right Moves) and singer Jordin Sparks (American Idol) are recognizable but nothing to write a review about.

Sadly, it wasn't.Cons Vs Pros (Yep, it's reverse order so you're don't mistakenly think Pros wins.) Cons: 1. The acting is sad and stilted. Some actors are OK (the midget who's name I don't remember, Cage on occasion) but most are just horribly high-school level actors.2. The writing is full of padding and over stereotyping. All boys do not want a baseball glove, particularly if they wear glasses and have pale skin. All Christians don't sound like the Westboro baptist church or wishy washy whine-bags.3. The music is 1980's sitcom style. Lots of \"scoobity doo do doo, you'll find your way, just look up to the sky\" type movement and mood music. I want to call it predictable but that word is overused and doesn't really fit. It's more like... sense-dulling. It makes you want to have a glass of milk, cookies, and a long nap.4. The directing is weak and amateurish. i.e. In the first scent the mom and daughter are having a phone conversation and instead of 2-3 location changes they swap back and forth for every sentence. It can make your head swim.Pros: 1. The message is semi-solid. As one passenger in the plane put it, \"That's it?\". Yes, that's it.I'd pay James Cameron $4 billion to remake this movie with good actors and a great CGI budget. Maybe we should start a kickstarter campaign.",

That much he did well.I liked the action sequences with the daughter in different vehicles and some of the explosions. They were just the right amount of sensational.Even the confrontation between Christian and doubter at the airport was done well. Neither party got too carried away. The Christian lady kept her cool and the doubting daughter knew when to walk away.I'm not sure what the point was of having Lea Thompson in it for a few minutes, but I guess it gave the picture more star power.My favorite part involved the mom's pastor admitting that he didn't have genuine faith. He explained it simply and beautifully.O.K., it had some 70's disaster film clich\u00e9s, but those cheesy aspects make it fun. We loved those movies didn't we? Finally, the Christian message was not heavy-handed at all.

            "content": "My wife and I chose 2014's \"Left Behind\" as a capper to a day spent binge-watching absolute crap on Netflix, and it did not disappoint. When it comes to watching what will obviously be a bad movie, I prefer ones that aim high and fail miserably, rather than the tongue-in-cheek, intentionally-bad variety like \"Jack Frost 2\" or \"Jersey Shore Shark Attack.\" And \"Left Behind\" does indeed seem to take itself quite seriously.You know the plot: once the Rapture commences, the devout are immediately whisked away to Heaven while everyone else is left behind to face the coming apocalypse on Earth. Airline captain Nicolas Cage suddenly finds half of his passengers have gone missing mid-flight, while his daughter on the ground navigates a New York City that's instantaneously devolved into murderous rioting.Other reviews here pretty much cover the whole spectrum of things to find wrong with this Christian disaster flick--the lack of tension, the lack of character, the wooden this, the wooden that--but what I found curious was the overemphasis on Belief as the qualifying factor as to who stays and who's saved, as opposed to any sort of Virtue. And when I say Belief, I mean belief in the Rapture specifically. Apparently living by the ten commandants or following Christ's path isn't enough to satisfy this God. While plenty of those left behind are easily classified as \"sinners,\" others appear to be perfectly decent folk whose only real flaw is disbelief in a God as petulant as this one. Conversely, the only reason given as to why Captain Cage's born-again wife is spared from the apocalypse is her certainty of its coming. In such an exposition-rich movie as this, a laundry list of good deeds done wouldn't have been out of place, but apparently none are needed. Meanwhile the family pastor is forsaken, even though his self-confessed crisis of faith only seems to apply to that brief bit in the Bible about the end of times; otherwise he's a good man doing good work who's screwed over by God simply because he finds it hard to believe that God would screw people over like this. Which makes me wonder how the writers would have handled a character like Pinky from \"Brighton Rock\" in this scenario. If the pastor, despite all of his merits, is stuck below just because he's failed to read the Bible so literally, does the unrepentant sinner get a free pass as long as he's a devout believer in the world's damnation? Forget the pastor, though. Forget the hot flight attendant whose only apparent sin is a preference for hot pink lipstick. Forget Captain Cage's daughter, whose worst offense is refusing to be bullied by her mom into adopting a whole new belief system that Mom herself has only just recently adopted. Forget the gentle, selfless, spiritually-minded Muslim who's unlucky enough to have been born and raised in a culture with what turns out to have been the wrong holy book. Here's the part that will make you want to skip right over atheism so you can rally behind Lucifer instead, just so God feels the extra sting of being acknowledged AND THEN rejected:Children here are given an immediate free pass and whisked away to Heaven, presumably because they lack the free agency to make such important decisions for themselves (defining the borderline between child and adult is cleverly sidestepped by a conspicuous lack of teenage characters). Meanwhile, the sweet old lady who's clearly slip-sliding into dementia is left behind while her grumpy husband is plucked away to safety. In the year 2014 this woman lacks the mental facilities to recognize that the brown-eyed 30 year-old seated across the aisle from her is NOT in fact Frank \"Blue Eyes\" Sinatra, but she IS expected by the Man upstairs to take an informed stance as to the nature of the universe. WTF?This movie is in essence the equivalent of low-budget rape-porn for exclusionary Christians: watching the little b*tches squirm while they get what they deserve.",

I could have listed to the whole movie on only my left front speaker and it would have sounded the same.To have a group of talented actors, a huge budget and a promising story go so horribly wrong is truly the work of an imbecile. This film looks very much like an amateur production and the actors no matter how hard they tried couldn't pull the movie around. This is a shallow and boring film with very little action.

Blending science fiction elements with biblical concepts, the script is imaginative yet strongly biblically based. The production is made in the big Hollywood blockbuster style but retains the intimate spiritual power that was originally important to the drama. A fine cast of acclaimed actors give some of their greatest performances and the characters they play are deeply moving. The lovely Lea Thompsen is particularly effective and this is the most fully realized work she has done in years. It is, however, Nicholas Cage who stands out, delivering his best performance since his Oscar winning accomplishment in Leaving Las Vegas. Overall, this is a profoundly powerful film that offers a brilliant interpretation of bible text incorporated into the context of a science fiction event movie format. Not without its flaws, Left Behind is still artistically inspired cinema that is at times simply brilliant and always quite moving.",

It really isn't quite that bad, but over 1/3 of the votes are \"1\", likely from all those who simply do not like any movie based on religious beliefs. In one scene we see a watch belonging to the co-pilot, on the face is \"John 3:16\". We have also seen that on TV at sporting events over the years, some fan holding up that inscription in view of the camera. So what does it mean?John 3:16 is \"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.\" But John 3:18 may be more appropriate for this movie, \"Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God's one and only Son.\"The premise of this movie is the day has come, without warning, believers are suddenly taken, and non-believers are left behind to suffer the wrath of a world going bad. Nicolas Cage is airline pilot Rayford Steele, he is leaving for a flight to London as his daughter arrives in New York to see him. He says he has to go, but his lie is that he is trying to romance one of the flight attendants, taking off his wedding ring and leaving it in the car. Naturally the rapture happens while the plane is in the air, some passengers disappear, only their clothes and other belongings are left behind. A crisis occurs over the Atlantic when another plane has lost its crew and clips Steele's plane, forcing it to turn back but with no place to land. They have to improvise. The pilot's daughter is Australian actress Cassi Thomson as Chloe Steele. Like her dad, she too had rejected her mother's admonitions and as a non-believer she was not taken, and she has to help dad find a place to land the plane safely.This in not a very good movie, even for those who believe in God and believe there will be a rapture. Cage and Thomson are good, with the material they have to work with, but the script is very uneven and the message could have been delivered in 15 minutes. Their attempt to add action and excitement was only partially successful, and people on the plane behaved in ways that aren't very believable. Not a \"3\" but maybe a \"4\" or a \"5\" as a movie, regardless of the subject matter.",

Sure, it is preachy, a bit stilted but it does have some effective editing and is is certainly not Nichols Cage's worst movie.

            "content": "Walking into the cinema... I have spoken in previous reviews that the only way to earn the right to speak about a film is if they have actually seen it. Begrudgingly, I am going to see Left Behind, because I want to be able to give an honest and knowledgeable answer to the question, \"What did you think of the Left Behind movie ?\" Seems a heavy price to pay for accountability, but to the cinema I went. Cinematic value: 1 star Theological value: 2 stars Overall rating: 1.50A stereotypical, dysfunctional family cinema. That is the best way to describe the Steeles of the Left Behind film. Chloe (Cassi Thomson) is the university student with a chip on her shoulder, Ray (Nicolas Cage) is the father who is an international pilot who is considering an affair with a stewardess and Irene (Lea Thompson) is the mother who has become a Christian in the last year. In the eyes of Chloe and Ray, Irene's religious fervour is the cause of family's problems. She talks about her new found faith in Jesus and continually challenges her family to believe in God. Irene's primary reason for earnestly communicating this message is based in her biblical view of the end times, specifically of the rapture. The belief that Christians will vanish from the earth prior to a global tribulation. 'Are you ready?' is the theme of the Irene's questions and of the film. During a trip home to see the family, Chloe is able to see her father as he is about to leave for London and in an interesting twist of events, meets the world-famous, investigative journalist, Buck Williams (Chad Michael Murray). Buck and Ray are on the same fated flight heading to London. After seeing her father at the airport and later having an argument with her mother, Chloe is out with her brother at the local shopping centre. In the blink of an eye, the rapture occurs. Ray and Buck are in the air to London, Chloe is left alone to defend herself in New York and the surreal drama begins to unfold. The remainder of the film is played out as the characters manage life through the ensuing chaos and their investigation into what has happened. The harsh realities of life set in as they see how the world has changed in an instant and they need to determine how they will get on with the next few hours, much less the rest of their lives after being left behind. Vic Armstrong is a stunt-coordinator turned director who gets the daunting task of bringing the first book from the Left Behind series to cinemas. To his credit, he only takes on the first few chapters of the original book. Which leaves him with the action side of the rapture, but not the introduction of the new world order. Armstrong only has to manage a handful of characters and a six hour window of time. Also, the signing of Nicolas Cage and Chad Murray by the production team gives this new version of Left Behind some Hollywood credibility. As a performance, Cage does manage to work with what he is given with the limiting script, but that is where the accolades end. The production budget must have been paid to Cage. The remainder of the production was difficult to endure. The script, the effects and the music are poorly initiated. Even within the realm of Christian cinema, this film did not measure up to the the expectation that was conveyed by bringing Cage on board. Based on the multitude of examples of bad production value it would not be gracious and would show poor form even as a reviewer to lambaste this film. It was a struggle to find any redeeming values in this film. At times the audience was laughing because of the awkward nature of the production and not due to any humorous moments. It is best to say that the term 'disaster film' has multi-layered meaning with Left Behind. Two striking thing about the film were the negative portrayal of Christians and the fact that Jesus' name was not mentioned throughout the script. The film distracted from the intentional message of the Bible. This film does not warrant any recommendations and should be avoided. The opportunity to have a discussion about salvation through Jesus should be the centrepiece of the conversation. If you are a Christian reading this review, the challenge is for you to evaluate what you believe. Have you taken time to consider what you know about the the biblical view of the end times and how would you have a conversation with someone? Ensure that the conversation is not judgemental, but is based in a personal study of the topic and centred on Jesus. If you are someone who is not a Christian, but find yourself reading this review. Are you interested in finding out more about the Bible, Jesus or Revelation? If you are in Australia, contact City Bible Forum or if you are in the US, contact Saylorville Church. Leaving the cinema... What do I think about Left Behind? I will have to admit that I will have to give two different answers. As a film reviewer, this was a poorly executed film and I would not recommend it to anyone. As someone who looks at every opportunity to talk to people about the Bible and Jesus, if someone chooses to go see the film, let's talk. You will need some clarification and explanation after watching this 'disaster' film. What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What does the Bible have to say about the rapture? (1 Thessalonians 4:17, Luke 17: 34- 37) 2. What does the Bible have to say about the end times?Written by Russell Matthews based on a five star rating system @ Russelling Reviews #russellingreviews",

Note the directors name and NEVER watch anything they make ever ever again, Mr Cage-Red Card get off.Ohh Yes the secret, shhhh There is no god and if there was hes made a hell of a mess of my planet and if he moves in mysterious ways he need to stop arseing about and sort things out and if he isn't powerful enough to then I ain't going to worship him' ssshhhhh.",

Here God is chaotic in the way he does things and impossible to understand. The question is asked - \"Why God lets so many bad things happen\" and the \"Christian\" stands there dumbfounded. The fact that she is Dumbfounded may actually be typical of many \"Christians\" today. But the simple answer would have been that Satan promised Eve to \"Be like God knowing good and Bad\" Eve decided she wanted independence and Adam followed her. God is proving now that independence has been a disaster for mankind. If God ran around putting out all the fires behind the scenes that mankind is setting then he would be helping mankind prove that they can be independent. Also He promises in his own time to completely undo the damage that has been done all these years. Only he knows how that can be done. 1John 3:8 and Heb 2:14 <and many others. Believe it or not a little old lady who knocked on my door told me this simple but clear explanation one day.\nThe movie in no way answered any of the many questions raised in the minds of the people watching about Gods fairness for what he does. They all sit there until the end of the movie and end does little to redeem God. Watch out for these movies masquerading as \"Christian movies\". Many are likely written by Atheists.PS: A little something about the \"Early Springers\" that the movie showcased. What will happen if the \"Rapture\" Does not happen on Que as is in this movie? Could you imagine the disillusionment? The Bible does not say exactly when God will call those that are really his. In fact is says that the Tribulation is cut short on account of the Elect/Chosen -Matt 24:22 and Satan even wages war with them -Re 12:17-13:8. The idea that true Christians will completely avoid the Tribulation is pure wishful thinking.Pet",

With that being said....This movie had very few references to the Bible, even when the entire story was directly based on part of the Bible. All of you \"complainers\" knew what it was going to be about before watching it, so how could you possibly be offended by its Christian content? (If you put your hand in a fire you WILL get burned!)Based on the reviews here, I decided to watch this movie expecting it to be terrible, but even with its flaws,I thought it was pretty darn good. It held my attention for its full duration, something that a bad movie cannot do, so I have no complaints. No, it wasn't any five-star block-buster, but just how many of those have been made in 2014? Two or three.... four, maybe?On all the reviews, on all the movies including this one, I have to question what so many people expect from a movie. A movie is a MOVIE! It's not supposed to be \"accurate\" in every way unless it's labeled as a documentary. It's supposed to be entertaining, which most of them are, and that includes even the ridiculous ones if you'll just watch them instead of picking them apart.I watch all types of movies excluding musicals. I simply cannot stand musicals, so I could gain exactly nothing by watching one, and my biased review of it would be totally worthless to anyone. (I hope you understand what I'm saying.)Note that I registered here for the sole purpose of commenting on this movie in response to all the negative reviews. I highly recommend it to those who like science fiction, those who watch movies for for entertainment, and those who have an open mind. I do NOT recommend it to atheists, Muslims nor anyone else who is offended by Christianity, including the Word of our Christian God, as I see that is the only reason for 99.9% of those negative reviews.",

ISIS apparently believes in dishing out heavenly ordained atrocities themselves, and by their actions acquire additional holiness. Rapture fantasists -- of course posturing innocence by claiming they will be only witnesses of a cataclysm that bears no wishful content on their part -- hope that their god will dish out those atrocities and through their belief in the Rapture they will acquire additional holiness, along with the aforesaid excitement. In both cases we confront a kind of sanctioned sadism that is simply repellent and thoroughly *unexciting,* dismaying. Rapture fantasists only disagree with ISIS about who should die and under what auspices. These thoughts sorta got in the way of appreciating anything else about the film.Compared to this stuff, other apocalyptic films, like Day After Tomorrow, seem downright upbeat. You can get your thrills from megadeaths, and then interpret the film as inspiring a change in social practices. Not so here.",

Also, the appearances by Nicolas Cage, Lea Thompson, Martin Klebba, and Gary Grubbs almost give this \"film\" a kind of validity. The rest of the actors look like they came from any Neo-Evangelical Rapturistic Vineyard/Calvary Chapel of Southern California. All of the minor actors in this film, probably came from some church group. Possibly from Tim LaHay's home town, El Cajon, California.Regarding the Rapture, the Bible has this to say about it:Luke 1736 Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. 37 And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.Note the word \"Eagles\", Greek \"aetos\" - This is a word used to refer to birds that are carrion-eaters. Also, considering that the original text was written in Aramaic, the Greek is also a translation, so - A more English translation of the verse would be:36 Two men shall be in the field; one magically disappears, and the other will stand there and gawk. 37 And they answered and said unto him, taken where, Lord? And he said to them, Wherever there is a corpse, there will be carrion- eating birds.Which is the standard, accepted meaning of the verse. This is not a verse that tells us that God will magically cart away all of His believers, this is a verse about Judgement. The verse says that the one TAKEN is the one who is in trouble. Those evangelicals who spout \"rapture\" sci-fi theology are basically twisting the meaning of the verse to their own ends.As far as this film, you can tell the year something was made by the iPhone 4/4S's and Galaxy III's they are toting around.But one thing that was valid, in the whole movie: The Girl \"Chloe\" (Cassi Thomson) really could have given her Pilot-Dad Nic Cage his landing coordinates via her cell phone, even in 2010 when this film was actually made (you can tell by the software on their devices, it's all iOS 5 and Android 4.0).Other than these little gripes, I enjoyed it, and I was not expecting to. Having the better actors did help a bit. Maybe next time this book is made into film, the Jesusers will step aside and let a real Hollywood movie company make it. This might improve the story, as well as serve the original writers by making a movie that is less offensive to us sinners who have affairs, do drugs, and don't swallow whole any crazy talk about Raptures and stuff.Ironically, this is probably the one review of mine not downvoted simply because I liked it. But I could not in good conscience give this 10 stars.",

See, I've seen some serious schlock over the years from flop blockbusters to the trashiest no-budget horror cinema and rather like a bit of 'so bad it's good'.Anyway, Left Behind is basically a story about some people vanishing into thin air on a plane, the plane hitting another plane, and an adulterous pilot saving the day with the help of his estranged daughter and a tight-bloused sex kitten out of Neighbours. Pretty typical multiplex junk, then.The only thing that makes this concept vaguely interesting is that the people weren't taken by aliens and dragged into another dimension but were sucked up to heaven in God's Rapture. It's based not so much on Christian teachings but rather on a narrow, prophesy and end times obsessed reinterpretation of the bible called 'dispensationalism', which was dreamed up in the 1800s and became a hit with American fundamentalists in the 20th century when crazy new sects were all the rage.Thus this 'Christian' film will not just seem bonkers to non-believers but to Catholics, Orthodox and most mainstream Protestants too. Alien abduction might have been a better explanation to account for the missing passengers but then this movie's really a theological propaganda piece pushing premillennialist dispensationalism.What Cage is doing in it I have no idea.",

Well what did you expect from a movie that is based on Christian Theology?Did it have some \"Hollywood\" aspects to it, of course it is a Hollywood movie. Revealing dress and an emphasis on showing female shape as often as possible. That is what you get to draw a \"wide\" audience.This is what I hope to be a first in a long line of movies that portray the books. It is just a set up for much more involved and intertwined relationships and hardship. Along with some portions that will need to have action packed parts.I say to those who produced the film:We are ready for the next one!Bravo on this one.One of the Way",

One of the down sides, is that the acting was mediocre at best, and I would expect more from academy award winner Nicolas Cage, and 80's legend Lea Thompson. I did enjoy Chad Michael Murray in the main role. I didn't really like Jordin Sparks in her role, I thought he acted was very rusty. I think the movie told the story pretty well, I did like how this version actually showed the people disappearing and the chaos going on outside in the world. There wasn't a whole lot of character development behind the characters, so some of them I just didn't care much about, that was another big problem, they didn't make you care about the main or supporting characters. I really hate it when movies do that, I want to care about what happens to the characters in a movie I'm watching. 6/10. It was just alright, but it had the potential to be a lot more than what it actually turned out to be",

Im not dogmatic about this because no matter what anyone thinks or believes it will go down the way it goes down inspite of anyone's view. I think Nicholas Cage is a good actor and have enjoyed some of his movies as well. I for sure am not into the LaHaye/LaLonde/ books and have never read any of them. The movie in my opinion was a dude. I thought the original one with Kirk Cameron was a better movie. Yes there were some pretty cool effects blah,blah,blah. But zero mention of the gospel. Zero! So why did the Christians disappear of the earth? That was never truly explained outside of. \"They believed\". What did they believe? Yes it shows the pastor who got left behind and when the young girl who was missing half her family asked why he was still there? He simply stated he preached yada,yada,yada but he didn't really believe. Again believe in what? Yes we are told the world is going to get really, really bad now. But why. Nicholas Cages acting was just not very convincing. I like the actor who played Buck (the original Kirk Cameron part) as well as the actress that played Chloe.For once Christianity Today got it right they state \"Christian magazine Christianity Today heavily criticized the film, saying, \"Left Behind is not a Christian Movie, whatever 'Christian Movie' could even possibly mean. In fact, most Christians within the world of the movie\u2014whether the street-preacher lady at the airport or Rayford Steele's wife\u2014are portrayed as insistent, crazy, delusional, or at the very least just really annoying. They want churches to book whole theaters and take their congregations, want it to be a Youth Group event, want magazines like this one to publish Discussion Questions at the end of their reviews\u2014want the system to churn churn away, all the while netting them cash, without ever having to have cared a shred about actual Christian belief. They want to trick you into caring about the movie. Don't. We tried to give the film zero stars, but our tech system won't allow it.\" Myself Im waiting for the Daniel Project movie to come out. Im sure it will be a better film.",

And Cassi Thomson, who played Rayford's daughter Chloe Steele, was exceptional - she captured the skepticism of modern youth.The presentation of the Rapture was gripping!Yes, the movie does not exactly represent the book, but the overall message is there. We are now living in a time of war or rumors of war, a loss of respect for humanity, and governments vying for absolute power.

Especially, when the movie is made by not a special low-budget Christian film-studio, but by a multi-million Hollywood studio and with a heavyweight Nicolas Cage as a lead. Hollywood has long been rather hostile, if not mocking towards Christianity, and therefore, that was a real suspicion that this movie would be a real awkward mess. In fact, I am very much impressed with this 2014 movie. I never liked Nicolas Cage, but here he is not that bad, he is decent, solid and very convincing. Well, this is not his best role, but he did a real good job. In fact, all the main actors did a decent job here, and the overall atmosphere is very convincing. Well, this is a surprisingly good work, as the main Message is very much correct, and there are no distortions of the Biblical Truths. Of course, we may never guess how this Rapture can go, but the way it is shown in the movie is very strong, and this is probably The best moment of the film. Yes, there seems to be a possible sequel about the Last Times, and maybe that would be similarly not bad. Why do I give it an 8? The overall message is very correct and not so far from the Biblical Truth. But then, there are some typical Hollywood sentiments and clich\u00e9s, as well as there is not enough time to depict the deeper psyche of main heroes. These moments aside, once again, I must say this is NOT the worst movie of 2014 and this is a really OK effort in this extremely sensitive topic. Recommended for everyone interested in Revelation topic, but watch it at your own discretion and never forget to remember this is a movie, not the Bible. Anyway, pretty decent film.",

Rotten Tomatoes is full of green splodges by crits who've actually admitted what a great little movie this is and how much they've enjoyed it. What hypocrisy! You can't say you've enjoyed a movie and then give it a rotten score. That's not just hypocritical, it's irrational. And then there's the bunch of them who give directions about what the movie/director should have done. LOL! Go make your own then. I came across the movie browsing on Netflix. I love SciFi and \"what if\" scenarios. I couldn't stop watching when I started. The simplicity of the story and the good faith with which everybody involved acquit themselves makes for a breath of fresh air from all the cinematic pretentiousness that critics salivate at. Nicholas Cage is superb. I don't know why crits often accuse great actors of not choosing appropriate vehicles, meaning movies these crits would approve of: Cage bashing in all its hateful glory here. A movie is a movie is a movie. Cage lifts the whole thing to a totally worthy level: what's so wrong with a story of family dysfunction set to rights and reconciliation by cosmic events? Everybody's done it and continues to do it, all the big name directors included. Hell, the entire history of western drama from the Greeks through to Shakespeare and on to Spielberg is about human conflict and resolution. Cage brings authenticity and credibility to the role and the story at large because he underacts in that sublime way of his rather than carry on with Streep and De Niro level histrionics. He knows this is no Hamlet level role but that of an ordinary man caught up in ordinary life conflicts and issues. A hero beating a different drum. The close ups of his face from different camera angles is a simple but very effective technique to build the character and tell the story beautifully. He's got the face for this and the director runs with it and makes the most of it.Little gem of a movie. Full of heart and honesty. Loved it. Loved Cage in it.",

            "review_title": "More of a disaster movie than a religious epic",
            "content": "I'm not religious, let's clear that up right from the start. What I am is a movie nut and a very open minded one so I'll give just about any film a chance regardless of its subject matter. I think you have to be open minded to enjoy a lot of movies and if your not then odds are your missing out on some really great films. One of my favorite genres for example is horror and some of my favorite films are from that area of movie making. Without religion horror would be nothing but people killing each other for no reason. No ghost stories, no demons no witches or warlocks. Nobody would ever get possessed and the scariest thing on earth would be a guy in a mask that you could stop with a baseball bat. The Exorcist is one my all time top favorite movies and it makes my point perfectly. It's one of the best horror movies if not the best horror movie ever shot, yet religious culture is heavily embedded in the film and without that the movie wouldn't even exist. Does it's religious nature stop it from being an excellent example of movie making or an absolutely terrifying film? Not at all and the religious references in Left Behind don't stop it from being a good movie either. So some people believe this and some believe that, who cares? As long as the end result is a dam good movie what does it matter? Now, to be clear I'm not saying this movie is on the level of the Exorcist but it is a very good film and with an open mind anyone can enjoy it for what it is.In fact Left Behind belongs to another of my favorite genres, the disaster film genre. I love a good \"we're all screwed\" type of movie and this one fits the bill perfectly. It almost feels like Airport (1970) or one if it's sequels rather than a religious film like its predecessors.Unlike many of the reviewers, I have seen the original three Left Behind movies and despite their heavy religious leanings I actually enjoyed them from a disaster film standpoint. I like Kirk Cameron and I thought he was quite good in the original movies. All that said, despite my open minded ways I can see pretty much anyone being put off by the heavy Christian leanings of the left behind series. Luckily this version of Left Behind lightens all that up drastically. Being completely honest, it lightens it up so much that you forget the movie has anything to do with the bible. Is that good or bad? I don't know and I don't really care. This is a good movie plain and simple.There's plenty of drama, you come to like the central characters and you genuinely want to see them survive. Unlike the original Left Behind films, the majority of the story here centers around the plane and it's passengers. There are parts of the movie that focus on what's happening on the ground but the events on the plane are the crux of the story and that allowed the film makers to create a far more tense atmosphere than that of the original movie. The production quality here far exceeds that of the original as well and it has a very polished feel to it.All the performances are solid, the film is well cast and the direction is excellent. The editing and camera work are both fantastic and If your into disaster movies, story wise there's nothing here not to like. From start to finish this is an enjoyable movie with a classic disaster theme and a little hint of religion thrown in.The point I really want to get across to you is this, Ignore the naysayers and the kooks and give this film a chance. It's well worth it.",

Nicolas Cage gives a great performance in the film and reminds us of how he won the Oscar for Best Actor back in 1996. Cage brings a element to a film that makes it stand above the rest and, though some of his recent movies haven't been great, he brings a lot to any movie that he's in. The other actors in the film are fine in their roles. Powerful, thrilling, and featuring a great Nicolas Cage performance, \"Left Behind\" is a must-see. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "This movie was excellent as in my opinion it is a satire on all the Christian dogma regarding the rapture and doomsday prophecies. I think most movie goers and critics missed this point. Did everyone notice how much emphasis was placed on the loss of the children? Did anyone notice how much pain and grief was expressed by the parents? Chloe is bereft when she loses her brother, and she makes a point of going to the hospital to check if all the babies are gone. The mother that she meets there is clearly in misery and agony. There is also scene in the street where the father is sitting with his head in his hands next to an empty stroller. Even the scene where the dog was sitting next to the children's toys showed even the dog's bewilderment. The character Shasta on the airplane is so grief stricken that she cannot handle the fact that no one is responsible for the disappearance of her child. Also, another woman in the general passenger section was also distraught over the loss of her children. This extreme loss and sorrow by the parents and families over the children was clearly emphasized in the movie.Again, family is emphasized when the business man who was so consumed with money talks to the young woman about his own daughter. There was no mention of God in the scene ... just his own admission that he did not spend anytime with his own daughter. Great scene.The final point made is this ... What kind of God is this that would snatch children away from parents and family members that deeply love and cherish their children? Nicolas Cage was excellent in performance as he was determined to see the remaining passengers to safety.There was no profession of new found faith from any of the characters. In fact, Chloe reject the nonsense of the minister that she confronts in the church.Satire the use of irony, sarcasm, ridicule, or the like, in exposing, denouncing, or deriding vice, folly, etc.",

My God in heaven (or not, who really knows right? Apparently Nicolas Cage seems to think so and I certainly hope there's an afterlife for him because if his career is in the kind of state it needs to be for him to \"star\" in a movie like this, that literally might be what hell is) the screenwriter completely missed the boat on this one. I don't care if the end goal of the movie was to get you to believe in God or not, I was genuinely interested in this movie. There was quite a bit of potential based on the books because whether you are hardcore and believe Christian end times will come to pass or not, you must admit that a story over the proposed apocalyptic future would make a hell of a movie.Alas though the bible-thumper filmmaker's incompetence knows no boundary. Instead of making a real movie with real characters who propose real feelings and most importantly a real plot, they have chosen instead to obviously try to preach the word of God directly. Much like it's brethren God Is Not Dead (I am proclaiming them brethren, for they are very similar in nature) this sad excuse for a plot starts off with an obvious attitude of Christians being persecuted for their religion and atheists being evil doers who have lost the way. This is portrayed in the version of the main character and his wife not getting along because of her religion. She of course, like all Christians are in real life *cough cough* is patient and loving and simply satisfied with her faith all the same.I turned this off when I saw the man's daughter come up to a man preaching about God in the airport and chew him out for being a Christian. At that point my tolerance for intolerance had subsided and I decided my precious minutes should be spent elsewhere.I wish I could tell you I enjoyed this movie, as I did rather like the ones that were made in the early 2000's (be patient with me brothers and sisters, I was but a young'n then). Like I said earlier, this could have actually been a good movie. If they had done something like they did with Exodus (highly recommended) where they made an actual adventure story over an interesting myth (or history, to some of you) I would have been pleased. But beware those who think they know the will of God: they will ruin art and human expression in this pure (or sinful?) form and I for one will not stand for it.Go to hell, Left Behind.",

Because of this the audience can quickly point out what parts of the scriptures that the film left out; or what parts in the film aren't in the scriptures at all.It is exceptionally demanding to make a film about a Biblical prophecy that hasn't taken place yet because no one but God knows exactly how the prophecy will play itself out when it happens. And one of the prophecies the Left Behind movie is based on says this: \"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.\" -I Thessalonians 4:16-17.There are things in the movie that they could have done better and that's why I didn't give it a perfect 10. A score of 8 isn't bad though. Nicolas Cage, Lea Thompson and Cassi Thompson played their roles well. I especially liked the midget named Melvin who provided comic relief and was played by Martin Klebba. And it was good seeing Jordin Sparks and Lolo Jones on the big screen as well.The Left Behind movie is worth a watch. All things considered they did a good job.

This movie was not meant to. It was meant to appeal to more people and get the non-Christians or even those that are 'on the fence' to go see the movie. If it was too 'preachy' they would never come. That made complete sense to me and now makes me like the movie even more. My hope is that millions of people will see this movie and make them think, make them talk, and hopefully get some to start to learn more about what is said in the bible.

            "content": "\"Left behind\" has me struggling to find words to describe it. \"Bad\", \"ghastly\" or even stronger language all seem so inadequate.First of all, there is no Biblical basis for this \"Rapture\". Although Rapture fundamentalists claim that more than 20 verses in the Bible support the concept of \"Rapture\", examination of these verses (eg Romans 8: 18 - 19) shows they only use phrases such as the \"eager expectation\" of the second coming or, more unnervingly, refer to \"multitudes in the dust who sleep will awake\" (Daniel 12 v 1 - 2; see also Revelations 20, verses 4 and 5) which sounds like zombies rising from the grave (a scenario fortunately missing from this truly appalling movie). I am not sure which verse in the Bible is the basis for the rapturees' clothes remaining behind, although 1 Corinthians 15: 51 - 6=53 does refer to them being clothed with \"the imperishable\". There is a reference to \"gathering\" of the elect in Mark 13 but not even Revelations speaks about people vanishing as they are being lifted from the ground with their clothes behind them in the manner shown in this film.Second, the script and acting are terrible (I know Nicholas Cage has tax problems, but really..) and the special effects are laughable - the plane was a different make in each of its scenes, as one of the other reviewers has pointed out, the storms etc looked fake and the big city on fire at the end (spoiler alert!!) looked like a painting, and a bad one at that. Even the props are off, like the air hostess's crazy shoes, and what is wrong with Nicholas Cage's hair??? And nobody was on social media - how real is that.Third, the ethics and morals are questionable. The real missing people seem to be blacks - where are they all? There is a token Asian who is a nerd; does this mean that all Asians are going to hell? You can be a good religious person but if you are Moslem (like the guy on the plane), too bad. And the rapture only seems to happen to people who speak English. It is not even clear if this is happening outside America.There are intelligent, insightful films made about the Rapture. In fact, \"The Rapture\", starring Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny, is one of the most compelling and insightful films I have ever seen on any subject. The reason fundamentalists don't like this film is because it exposes the flaws in Rapture thinking, especially the extraordinary ending, which I won't reveal because I don't want to spoil it for others.I see \"Left Behind\" was nominated for awards - for the Razzies, that is. I am surprised it did not win. How could any other film in 2014 have been worse?In terms of general comparison with other \"worst films ever made\", this film has none of the low-budget problems producers like Ed Wood had, or the political stench of Nazi films like Jew Suss. What it is, however, is a propaganda film, rather like the propaganda ballets promoted like Qiang Qing which were used to destroy ballet and opera during the Cultural Revolution. Like all truly frightening propaganda, it is designed to terrify the audience into agreeing.On another topic, I have a complaint to make. Why does IMDb require all reviewers to put at least one star? To give even one star to a film of this kind is too generous.",

Indeed, if hell exists, it's probably a place where every theatre and every television station shows \"Left Behind\" over and over again for eternity. That concept is so intimidating , even the worst sinner will shout fervent Hallelujahs in an effort to evade such a ghastly fate. God's ways are indeed strange.\nIf the motion picture academy had an Oscar for \"Worst Movie\", this would be the overwhelming winner for 2014. Likewise \"Stupidest Film.\" It obviously will never be shown as an in flight movie. Airlines don't want passengers using the escape hatch in flight.",

It is not only me who thinks that, even the audience towards which it was aimed (which was hyper-conservative, extremist christians I guess) panned it mercilessly. Even as a religious person myself I found absolutely no redeeming qualities to this dumpster fire. It makes religious people look like mad people who think that there's no other possibility for salvation except being a spotless and perfect person who has never sinned or had any doubts in any way and makes agnostics and atheists, as well as people from other religions (specially Muslims) look like irredimable sinners and criminals who are bound to suffer due to not agreeing with the movie's viewpoint. \nDirection, dialogue, acting, plot and premise are all completely abysmal. Suffice it to say that even Nicolas Cage's overacting looks good compared to other people in the film. All characters are cringy and all their actions are overwhelmingly stupid (wait until you see the Muslim-hating small person, the paranoid woman who draws a gun on a plane to threaten other passengers because she believes her husband made her daugher vanish into air midflight, the \"investigative journalist\" who everyone seems to know and admire even though it's never explained why, the stewardess named Hattie and the main character who keeps looking for her brother in hospitals and churches and calls home to see if he returned even though he disappeared in front of her leaving all his clothes and his backpack behind). It fails to set any atmosphere or even to keep the attention of any single person who dares watch it. I like movies so bad they're good as they can still be enjoyed as unintentionally funny, and even though this one does have some campily funny moments, the rest of this movie is so unimaginably bad that it only made me wish IMDb allowed people to rate movies with a score under zero.",

How could I have been so wrong?I sensed something amiss, when, during one of the opening scenes, we see Cage get out of his car. As he turns toward the terminal entrance, there is a blatantly cruciform ATC tower in the background, but i ignored this and soldiered on (nah, the filmmakers wouldn't do THAT, would they?). Further along, we come across Chloe's mother who is excited that her daughter is home and absent-mindedly(?) places her gardening gloves on a book - blatant, yet again... the book is a bible!I again chose to ignore this, although by now I was getting suspicious and soon had those suspicions confirmed... (won't and shouldn't need to say more)...Bu**er it!

All of the aviation stuff is completely fake and unconvincing. I don't have a problem with minor technical inaccuracies, especially when they are not relevant to the film. However, when the technical inaccuracies are so glaringly obvious, as in this film, it detracts from the message that the film is trying to deliver.The dialog in the film made me look at the characters as just Caricatures of Human Stereotypes.

This one scene is dragged out for two hours. That's it, that's the entire movie! No, Jedi knights, no war against the empire, no blowing up the death star. The remake is just one scene from the original dragged to two hours without any mention of the larger story which actually interested the original audiences. That's the remake of 'Left Behind.'Not of as it 'Left Behind' was anywhere on the level of 'Star Wars.'Somehow this Hollywood production has EVEN WORSE production quality than the original 2000 direct to video Kirk Cameron version.This is based on Tim LaHaye's best selling \"direct from God revelations\" about the end times.It's told from the point of view of GNN (Global New Network) reporter Buck Williams in Israel when the Soviet Union invades! God himself comes down to smite the Red Army and save Israel.Then the Rapture happens. Millions disappear into thin air. This of course is the heretical theory that if you believe in the Rapture enough you will be taken to heaven before the end of the world, hence avoiding the horror and headaches of the chaos.Williams later discovers that the new leader of the UN is actually the antichrist.The new Nicholas (Coppola) \"Cage\" film misses the ENTIRE point of the book! It focuses only on ONE single scene from the book where Buck Williams is on a panicked airplane and when the Rapture occurs. But Buck (Chad Michael Murray) isn't the star, Nicholas Cage the pilot is!There are so many other odd things about the film as well. Although people disappear, clothing appearing out of nowhere. Seriously, there's a scene in a shopping mall where clothing just drops from the ceiling. Children's clothing! Was the mall using child labor to clean the ceiling or something? Also, the character of Bruce Barnes is Caucasian in the novel but played by a black actor. He was also played by a black actor in the original because he was a member of Kirk Cameron's church. So why is he black in the remake? Did the film makers even read the book? So the movie utterly misses the point of the novel altogether. One scene from the book is expanded to take up the entire film.What about the Soviet Union invading Israel? That scene might have made a good movie. Silly sure, but exciting.The Kirk Cameron version is at least entertaining on some base levels. Or to laugh at. The actors literally took the novel as gospel so you certainly put their souls into it, literally. This remake is just so bizarre.Who was target audience? Fans of the book will be disappointed and the rest of the population loath the Rapture cult so much they'll stay away from it altogether.",

I can't say enough bad things about it. Cage must be broke to work on a stink bomb of this magnitude.Here is the thing: the world is not going to end. Many preachers have predicted these things over and over and they NEVER happen. Even Jesus falsely predicted he would return within the lifetimes of his followers if you read what he actually said and not what some preacher tells you.

However.The film started off promisingly, with Snail Boy (Mayor Dodson) really giving the performance of his career, giving the third best snail performance I've ever seen (after Snail Sleepover, and SnailMail: The Spiral Trilogy). \nHowever.I'd heard beforehand that the giant snail shell, which the producers had spent 90% of the budget on, had been lost during production. The camera tricks to hide this fact worked at first - very clever, oh yes - but they lost their effect quite quickly. For the rest of the film, you could definitely tell that he didn't have a shell.However.The grotesque shell-less snail boy delighted and disgusted in equal measure. The film could have done with about five or six or seven or eight or nine or ten or eleven or twelvety hundred thousand more snails, but I can forgive this, given the delightful Donald Trump cameo as Hillary Clinton.Although.The film reaches it's climax with Snail Boy returning from heaven with 1 billion Yorkshire Puddings - one too many!

            "content": "Just my opinion, of course, but I found it to be pretty bad. There are some bright spots, primarily Nicholas Cage and Chad Michael Murray, but for the most part, the dialogue feels hackneyed and forced, the soundtrack is just awful. I mean, Christian pop? Really? We can't do orchestral music to heighten tension? It's just full of smarm, and sanctimoniousness. The few breakout moments were decent, and I'm glad they gave the female actors in this movie more to do than panic or worry about their men, but it was produced by Paul Lalonde, so no matter how appetizing the rest of the sandwich, there's a big turd slapped on it right there. The Cloud Ten pictures guys just aren't up to the task of producing a high quality film. They belong on the Hallmark channel, not in the theater.I admit, I wanted to like it, I really did. I like a good disaster/apocalypse film, but this was just awful. Nothing even happened for the first half of the film. Of course, for me the greatest sin (heh) was the use of Christian pop for the movie's soundtrack. In fact, this whole film felt more like a made for TV Hallmark movie of the week.Now, to be upfront, I liked the scenes with Nicolas Cage, because he's a veteran actor and usually puts in a good performance, and I think Chad Michael Murray did a far superior job as Buck Williams than Kirk Cameron. Of course, all Chad had to really do was act human, so not much of a stretch for most humans.Still, there were some decent scenes. I liked the near collision incident in the film; otherwise, the scenes inside the plane felt like \"Airplane\", but without the self-awareness. I did find one or two tender moments in those scenes: Where the millionaire talks to scared blond lady about raising his own daughter, and where Buck comforts her earlier on in the film shortly after the disappearances. Both moments had flavors of human empathy, which is what this film should have shown everywhere.Now, on to the first part of the film before I forget: Remember that first scene with the really smarmy Christian lady? Yeah, I don't like her, and if she got to heaven ahead of the kind, compassionate human beings who were left behind, then it only shows the glaring flaw in this film: be an ass, and Jesus will still take you as long as you pay him lip service. Help people, be kind, and compassionate, but without saying the magic words you're going to be left behind and you're going to face horrors which you deserve because you didn't say the magic words! Finally, there was the scene with Pastor Bruce Barnes and Chloe, and where the best line in the movie happened. I found it funny when Chloe asked Bruce where her mom and Raymie had been taken, and he replies that Jesus took them to heaven to save them. Chloe replies, \"from what?!\" but before he could answer, the quip shot into my own mind, which was \"from himself!\" Because that's the guy who is doing this. Not anyone else. The Big Man is the one setting these things in motion. It all falls to him.Of course this isn't what Bruce says, but most people watching the film will see this connection right away.In short, a very poor quality film based on a very poor interpretation of theology.",

There is such an anti-God movement in this country, I'm surprised this movie was even made. I was expecting it to be hated... but there's really no reason for the hate.Let me explain: I am a Christian but I am deeply ashamed of the Christian films of the past. The original Left Behind movie is fine. I'm talking about the really awful, cheesy, ridiculous movies like God's Not Dead, a movie so out of touch with reality that it depicts all non-Christians as total jerks and who are completely deserving of the hardships they go through. But Left Behind doesn't do this.There is no unrealistically corny conversion at the end. The spirituality of the film isn't shoved in your face. Emphasis is put on the struggle of the characters as opposed to their spiritual journey. Judgmental Christians are depicted negatively.The biggest miracle of this film by far, however, is the subtle Nicolas Cage performance. Fans of his freakouts will be disappointed because his acting is great.My only complaints are in some of the actors. The kid who played Raymie was the worst of the bunch but he was also pretty young so I'm not going to judge him too harshly. There were a few small scenes that were unnecessary. Some of the special effects looked kind of dumb, particularly the green screen work. Fans of the book will be disappointed because it deviates a lot but I think it does that so it will appeal to all audiences instead of just Christians.I thought there could have been more spirituality but I'm glad that it was kept at a minimum because I think non-Christians can see this without being offended. Why would a loving God put people through something like this? The question is never fully answered and, honestly, I like that a lot. It allows people to make their own decision about how to see this film.I've seen plenty of awful movies. This wasn't an awful movie. The only reason Christians hate it is because it doesn't talk about the Bible as much as most would probably want. And the only reasons non- Christians hate it is because they hate anything having to do with Christianity.Get over your bias and watch this movie as a movie. I highly recommend it because it's well made and it asks a lot of good questions that can lead to some great discussions. I think if people see this with an open mind, this movie would be more positively received.And this is coming from someone who fully expected to point at it and laugh.",

            "review_title": "Actually somewhat amusing",
            "content": "A 2/10 movie with a 5/10 Nic Cage performance based on a ludicrous premise done somewhat competently.The crux of all these left behind films is, even if you believe the premise it doesn't make much sense in their own universe or even theologically. Raptures may have enjoyed a long tradition in several religions, including christianity, but they're not really much of a focal point in christian eschatological teachings despite US-american christian right-wing's obsession with it. It seems like every year another pastor has 100% reliably predicted the date of the rapture, only for the date to pass and nothing continuing to happen. It's pretty hilarious from the outside, so some of that entertainment value translates to this piece of uniquely american christian propaganda.I'll give Left Behind a teensy bit of credit for not being as mean-spirited and disgusting as other christsploitation flicks and for not indulging too much in evangelical persecution complexes, but this movie is still fraught with odd beliefs delivered in the most ham-fisted preachy way.Visually the rapture is the comedic highlight and all the dramatic camera swoops over pieces of clothing lying in the dirt or on chairs surrounded by flabbergasted onlookers don't sell them as a frightening sign of the apocalypse.Apparently the whole world is sunk into chaos and tohuvabohu by this event, and we collectively as a species turned the civilisation knob all the way to Mad Max 2 in an instant, as soon as little Timmy popped out of his baseball shirt and his earthly existence.I don't doubt such an incident would cause untold grief to many, but it doesn't actually look like that many people were zoomed up into the heavens or that the ones not saved were exclusively nasty murderous criminals which would explain the hellish conditions the earth is now in.Apparently the only folks lucky enough to prove worthy were proseletizing fundamentalist christians, new-born babies, prepubescent children, all air traffic controllers worldwide and even the entirety of tele-communications satellites? This is where the theology gets really blurry and the premise wonky beyond repair, even if you were to believe it in the first place. If you actually read the bible (and I did, mind you) the rules on how to be a good person, how to be a good christian for that matter can be incredibly arbitrary (have you ever eaten shellfish? Then so long, pearly gates) and even contradictory, so good luck earning your way into heaven. Which leads to the next problem: despite popular misconception, in christian teaching the only path to the kingdom of heaven is accepting Jesus, unlike in other faiths (including abrahamitic ones like judaism) where you prove righteous through your deeds. Hence by that logic babies couldn't actually get saved and with them a substantial amount of good people who haven't accepted Jesus but are otherwise living ethical lives. So yeah, the film's premise doesn't even make sense in its own universe. This is one of the reasons ideas of a big rapture aren't prominent features in most christian denominations, it doesn't even appear in revelations as a sign of the endtimes. While Left Behind is ostensibly made as christian propaganda, it thus feels much more like christian fan fiction.However there is a smidgen of residual entertainment value in its intrinsic ridiculousness. It's not as cheap-looking as other exemplars of the genre, so you can actually physically watch it from beginning to end without gritting your teeth at every technical detail of the production. Nicolas Cage is entertaining, especially when he looks like he's forced against his will to appear in a movie, but in general the premise is beyond stupid especially if you are a christian and even subtly disgusting the more you think about it.As a very devout non-believer this was actually somewhat funny to watch though. If you're into unintentionally revealing trash flicks this might be up your alley, but come prepared, this one is getting preachy as hell. Just as a film in itself though it's a catastrophe.",

His relationship with Cassie Thomson is utterly superficial. His role as a news reporter is not necessary to advance the plot. He could have just as easily been a rock star, a doctor or a hot dog stand vendor.The passengers on the plane. Their characters and faults are partially developed, but ultimately for no purpose other than to fill time.",

How did you get mixed up in this?? Great fun though, glad I didn't have to pay to see it.

            "content": "But even though it seems to be universally hated, I was entertained, and that's all I ever ask of a film. I saw the original series in the early 2000s, and I wish they'd have remade all 3. Maybe it's my partiality to Mr. Cage, as I find him so believable, even in the worst roles/movies, which are nearly always carried and rescued by him. He literally becomes whatever character he portrays, and that's a real feat considering he's been in well over 100 movies! No offense to Kirk Cameron, who played the pilot in the original movie series and actually is very religious, but I really was moved by Nicholas Cage's anguished portrayal of the airline pilot. Even though I knew the story already, there was still a lot of suspense. A few of the supporting actors really good, and the rest were capable. It's too bad the script couldn't have been jazzed up a bit, because this story had a huge amount of potential. Maybe they weren't allowed to change it up. The books have a lot more detail, but they don't have Nicolas Cage. Regardless of the reason some people were taken and others were left behind (religion or if it had been something else, such as alien abduction) this film was still good for me as a thriller. The direction, cinematography and production weren't outstanding but not bad, either. The special effects, such as empty vehicles crashing and the widespread scattering of clothes and belongings, were effective and not over-used. I took a few stars away. One was taken for predictability, whether or not the viewer has read the books or seen the original movie(s). Another was taken because I felt the music was a little over-dramatic, and the song being played during the end credits sounded cheesy to me. The last was taken because the cinematography and overall production wasn't inspired or overwhelming, but only average to me. If you're very religious or just like movies with stuff decent suspense, it's not the worst way to spend a couple of hours. Pass if you expect a superb blockbuster of a movie with plot twists. You know what they say about opinions...! This one was mine, and I hope it helps somebody decide: to watch, or not to watch!

However neither its religious fundamentalism nor political conservatism presumably appealed much to TV moguls so we have a small(ish) film instead. Most of the book's plot is ditched and instead a sort of 70's style aeroplane disaster movie is slightly awkwardly inserted to tie the characters together. The script is at least better than that of say '2012', treating the rapture with the same po-faced seriousness of any good Mayan prophecy. The special effects are cheaper though. The whole is better than the sum of its parts; solid direction and acting (Nick Cage is good as always, the supporting cast surprisingly winning) helps. However the film works best as a study of decent people under stress and just about winning out (as you rather hope and believe they would). As a result it has a strong redemptive streak that exceeds that of the underlying book series.",

It is very very far from the worst move ever as several reviews have claimed. Actually it was pretty good as a scifi/fantasy flick. I know it wasn't meant to be campy like Sharknado, but if looked at in that context it was entertaining.I think the whole Christian motif makes many people close to that religion, either pro or con, like or hate this movie. If you are ambivalent about the religious aspects, it is a pretty cool story and well portrayed.The pace of the film is good and it maintains interest. The acting is well done and there is some descent character development. Cage did a way better job than a couple of films I've seen him in recently (Rage 2014). Although far from his finest performance, he made the part believable. The dialog gets bogged down in several spots by spending too much time trying to convey a Christian value set, but it isn't too over the top preachy. And the script does give ample time to the point of view that most fundamentalist Christians are a couple sandwiches short of a picnic.The music throughout the film was horrible, gosh, just awful, but it wasn't everywhere so just ignore it.We embrace many strange concepts in movies all the time...zombies, vampires, killer computers, demons, honest politicians...well maybe that is a little too far-fetched, but talking animals, witches, gods, ghosts, hobbits, monsters, possession ...it's scifi/fantasy anything goes, so why not Christian mythology?

The scene where Chloe climbs to the top of the bridge and obviously thinks of taking her own life portrays how God's grace and intervention stops her in her tracks in a very difficult circumstance.

            "content": "I've enjoyed the film, it's been very frustrating to me how negative most people been towards it. It seems that both secular audiences and Christian audiences are usually unhappy with it. But I think I have figured out why. And the answer is actually quite simple- for most of us, if we have something against a movie (or anything else for that matter), we're generally going to hate it no matter how good it is (we focus on the negative, and ignore the positive).There are two kinds of movies- secular films and Christian films. And sadly this movie shows that the two types just don't mix. It seems that the filmmakers decided to make an exciting, action packed, Hollywood style film with big name actors in order to attract secular audiences and show them what we Christians believe is coming- the rapture. I'm sure it worked some, but it seems that any scripture is too much for the average secular audience, no matter how exciting the movie may be. If they had portrayed the rapture as science fiction, like alien abduction, it would've had a higher rating. The movie is very exciting and well done- a fact that many people either ignore or refuse to accept because of its Christian aspect. And at the same time, many Christian audiences also dislike it because of its Hollywood style, and the fact that it only has a bare minimum of scripture.As a Christian, I've been looking forward to this movie for many years now, longer than any other film. I'm somewhat disappointed with it, but I do still enjoy it, in fact the more I watch it, the more I enjoy it, but I do wish that it had more scripture. Even for the secular audience, I think it would've helped if they had explained the rapture a little more- they give almost no explanation of what it is and why we believe it, other than the fact that it's in the Bible.I think some Christian audiences also dislike it because it's so different from the books. The original Left Behind movie was very similar to the book. I enjoy it, but they sort of covered too much, they tried to squeeze the entire first novel into it, which didn't exactly work all that well. Ironically, this time it's the exact opposite, only a very small part of the novel is covered, just the first few hours after the rapture. But it's interesting to note that both authors of the Left behind series did not like the original movie, but do like this one. I actually find that somewhat surprising. I'm not sure which film I like better. I do hope they make sequels, but the ratings probably won't be much different.",

Him getting left behind and navigating a plane in this dystopian world. There are also some other important characters, like this Pastor who doesn't believe in god and A Guy who talks about Area 51 developing. stuff. So good, all are so important to the plot. What did you expect Worse. THIS MOVIE, I have no words. Oh wait. GIVE THIS MOVIE A SEQUEL.P.S: Only Watch this movie if you like Christain Propaganda or a heavily drunk",

            "content": "So, I read the book(s) several years ago and I can remember reading the entire 3rd book in just one night. The first movie that had Kirk Cameron was pretty low budget, like something you might watch on Lifetime. I remember wondering what the movie might have been like if it had a big budget and an all star cast. Well, this movie fell a little short... actually, it fell waaaay short! As the movie began, you know those little snippets that they show where the production company shows off their name, like DreamWorks with the kid fishing from the moon, or Pixar with the dancing desk light? Well this movie started with 4 or 5 companies that I had never heard of. Next, the movie began with a weak musical score that was, again, reminiscent of a made for TV movie. The acting was pretty poor by most characters and the writing was corny at times with characters inserted that took away from the storyline... like the 'angry little person' or the senior citizens on the plane with Alzheimer's. I have to admit, movies about Aviation or the Military have to do their research to keep me from snickering. The set for the cockpit was awful, the size of the plane making a trans Atlantic flight was incorrect, the plane crossing the Atlantic that they almost collided with was even smaller. And the biggest blooper was the decision to turn around so late after the 'Event' The movie was just poor all the way around, and dragged on at times... but I did like the fact that it provoked thought and opened discussion with my son who I took with me.",

No, However it is is well acted by most of the cast! Our entire theater applauded at it's end so I must not have been the only one who really enjoyed it!!!!!!!!!!! Just a side note: What would you talk about and how would you react if this happened today! The prayer vigils that are held after tragedies like 9/11 or school shootings tell me that many who don't necessarily believe in God or going church would be looking and turning to God for an explanation as most have herd of the Rapture at one point in their lives and and event like this would probably bring the world to their knees!!!

So glad I only wasted $1.50 at Redbox rather than $10 bucks at at theater. I feel sorry for those who wasted their precious time and money on this horrible excuse for a movie. I fast forwarded thru much of the movie. Any of the actors that are actually known are only in this to get a paycheck. I would imagine they will not have much of a paycheck.

This is where Nic's daughter arrives to deliver the zealot a good dose of whataboutism that's so badly acted it comes across more Stephen Hawkins than Richard Dawkins.But it does serve to set up the love interest angle , the so done with religion because of my mother who's suddenly born again ,angle and the meet dad angle.Dad just happens to be the pilot of the plane that Chad is flying on & who is ,by now, madly in love with Nic's daughter. This all plays out in the airport and all I can say is that it has the feel of a daytime soap to it , only not as well done.I'm not going to say anymore other than the directors instructions to his cast must of been as follows.\"Guy's I need you over act as badly as you can , I'll also throw in some weird \"character\" development scenes in to assist you in finding your acting rock bottom, and don't worry about the plot, the script or in fact anything because hopefully I'll go back to my janitor job after this \"Watch it only because it so so so terrible.",

Even a biblical thriller has potential, albeit limited, to be engaging. However, when watching Left Behind I was left with the overarching feeling that this film is actually really boring.Nicolas Cage's tendency to overact isn't actually evident here, as his character adopts a more sombre tone as a result of realising he hasn't done enough to redeem himself and will spend eternity on what is essentially a living hell. However, Cage comes across as more bored than sombre, which may be down to the fact that this film for a post-apocalyptic thriller is a needless snoozefest that delivers on none of the admittedly limited promise it has. It's also worth looking at the people, ahem, left behind, particularly one character who is left in purgatory simply for adhering to a different religion to his peers. You cannot tell me that Cage's wife who is in the midst of fanatically and dangerously flouting her beliefs is worthy of surviving the rapture either, as her character comes across as inherently unlikeable?I would recommend this film to anyone who also enjoys seeing how bad films can get without becoming a cult classic like The Room or Plan 9.

This movie was made on the very same topic as The Battle Hymn of the Republic. They both relate to the \"coming of the Lord\". The United Methodist Church (hardly radical) puts the Battle Hymn in the hymnal section entitled: \"A New Heaven and a New Earth, Return and Reign of the Lord\"Wikepedia, hardly a proponent of Christianity, says of the Battle Hymn of the Republic: \"The song links the judgment of the wicked at the end of time (New Testament, Rev. 19) with the American Civil War \" So it turns out all you people who wrote nasty, atheistic remarks in this board have been singing a song about Jesus and his return. Did you believe what you were singing you did just not pay any attention to what was coming out of your mouth? All of the lines in the first verse are from Revelation. You can, as they say, look it up. Go ahead, open the Bible and see. It won't hurt you. Get ready so you aren't trampled out as vintage of the grapes of God's wrath!By the way, this also proves there is no separation of church and state, because the Battle Hymn is regularly sung at state occasions and by the United States armed forces. No one will ever try, or be able to, get this hymn made secular, or changed in any way or stopped because the fact is, there is no separation of church and state. Instead there is freedom to think, say and sing whatever we want.",

But after watching this movie I realized where the bad reviews are coming from. This is not a documentary, it's a movie. It's meant to entertain and if some people take it personally, it's mostly because they don't believe in God because they are afraid they'll go to hell and their life would be just easier not to believe in anything. And this movie will be offensive to them since it will ad to their doubt that there might be some higher power judging them one day. People didn't judge \"Ghost\" years ago, because there wasn't such an anti religious movement back then. Just take away all the prejudice and enjoy the movie. I was glued to the screen until the end. And Nicholas Cage did a great job acting, I just don't understand when people don't like the subject of the movie they must judge the actors in a negative way as well just because they have different beliefs. Nicholas Cage fit the role perfectly and I think that the director Vic Armstrong did a marvelous job with this movie. I hope my daughter will have the privilege to be in one of his movies one day. This could have been a potentially disastrous movie if it wouldn't be for this director's art and courage. The other actors were also wonderful. I personally think the acting was superb with the exception of one or two supporting actors maybe. But without giving the story away, even if I think I would be one of those left behind but I'm not going to doom this movie and give it a bad rating. Some reviewers mention low budget? Are you serious? What planet did they come from? I've seen tons of low budget movies on Netflix, this movie has definitely beaten tons of high budget special effects overloaded movies for me.",

My friend who read the series of books the movie is based on also loved the movie.I didn't focus so much on the acting as the story line, but I did think Martin Klebba's antagonist remarks were hilarious. I thought Jordan Sparks did an amazing job. Chad Michael Murray is a hotty even though his super hero character is not all that believable. In the movie I laughed, I cried, I felt fear and I cheered. At the end of the movie, everyone (at least 50 people) in the theater stood up and clapped. I lived a life so far from both sides of the coin. As a child I could drink water from a stream in a forest not far from my home. We went Trick or Treating without chaperoned well into the night. At 13 years of age a single murder in Chicago made headline news. Politicians ran for office to improve our country not for self-indulgence and greed. Education was something I enjoyed and valued, not forced and a source of major stress for both student and educator. Animal abuse was not part of our vocabulary. We believed in our leaders and a future for our country. All this change has taken place in just shy of 60 years. A downward spiraling change at this rate of speed cannot sustain itself. The movie shows our world as it is today with greed, self-indulgence, theft, killing, selfishness. To me, this is a reality check. Maybe for others, this is just business as usual.Growing up as a Catholic I am not well-versed in the Bible. After seeing the movie I joined a Church with an intense Bible Study group.

I thought the movie was engaging albeit sometimes a little frustrating but overall I watched it attentively and thought Nicolas Cage was great. My suggestion is watch IT, and form your own opinion as its your opinion and enjoyment that matter the most. I think some of the negative comments are totally unwarranted and unnecessary. Enjoy!",

The whole purpose of the first book was to establish the main characters, set the catalyst for the stories \"the Rapture,\" and lay the ground work for the rest of the books, namely dealing with repentance, and being witnesses to the tribulation.Sadly the movie spent far too much time on the plane and not enough time dealing with the rise of Nicolae Carpathia and the formation or the tribulation force. This leads me to believe that the rest of the books will not be made into movies.Only Hollywood knows why they would do this. . .",

            "content": "This is probably the worst remake I've seen to date. Obviously, most of you have seen the negative postings, so I am going to touch on some things that weren't mentioned and try to keep it brief.I'll start off by saying, there's something to be said about low budget independent films, because usually the hunger is there so you get a better gem of a film. The original was just more genuine, scripted better and performed better. If you have seen the original, seeing this crapfest should really make you appreciate it more. If you haven't seen the original you owe it to yourself to make up for seeing this mess.First off, when I heard this was going to be based on strictly the rapture happening, I knew it was going to be long and tedious and boy I wasn't disappointed. It took about 25 minutes to get to the rapture. It was painstakingly slow. Then we the rapture happened it was even more unnecessarily long. Now, everyone knows that Nicholas Cages style of acting is better suited for some roles than others, this one definitely was not it. Forget the fact that physically he is no where near Ray's description. He was flat, unemotional and just seemingly uninterested in whom he was portraying. Watch Brad Johnson's portrayal of Ray Steele and you'll see what I mean. It wasn't just the writing and cornball dialog, but Nic really acted like he didn't want to be there.Love or hate Kirk Cameron, his performance as Buck was probably his best performance period. He gets a lot of hate because he's perceived as a religious zealot, which may or may not be true, but at least with his portrayal you got a level of sincerity and genuineness which made his character believable, that can not be taken from him.I absolutely hated Bucks portrayal in here and it wasn't so much as Murray's acting as it was the writing for his character, but it still came off as, I'm here for the pay check. Plus, his almost vainglorious introduction bothered me because Buck wasn't like that in the original film nor the books. Words escape me about what to say about Chloe's character, because her whole introduction and persona felt rushed and disengaging, nothing like Janaya Stephens. She was just bitter and surly for no reason. I was sitting there like huh?While we're on the subject of Buck and Chloe, I reallllly HATED the way he and Chloe were introduced. The entire scenario was unrealistic. A woman buys a Christian book and approaches Buck on his faith in GOD or lack thereof and then Chloe interrupts the conversation with her anti- GOD speech? No one does that. Jehovah's witnesses don't even do that and they're incredibly invasive. Buck was hitting on her hard and she came off like a floozy. That's not how they met in the original or books. It was really unnecessarily drawn out too.I don't know who played Pastor Barnes, but he can't lace Clarence Gilyards Sunday best shoes. This guy was just plain bad. I don't know how he managed to do this, but he was able to overact and underact simultaneously.Hattie was basically portrayed as a slut in here, which she wasn't in the original or the books. Plus she and Buck knew each other which apparently in here they didn't.The original isn't without its shortcomings, but it was a modern day masterpiece compared to this uninspired, cluster rushed, poorly written stinker. Please watch the original.",

I try not to be completely persuaded by others' opinions before I give a movie a view, but in this specific case Viewer Take Warning! Movie starts super slow and the acting on the Disney Channel is better then what I just witnessed. After about 40 minutes into the movie people are suddenly missing after a bright flash of light. What remains are all of the non believers. Aka almost everyone in the movie except for the children and a select few adults. Chaos ensues both on the plane and around the globe.

            "content": "For those of you who are interested in the study of the art of film, and need an exercise in calibration and a baseline with which to tell good from bad, I can wholeheartedly recommend this movie as the best way to finally and definitively answer the question \"what is the worst movie of all time?\".Nic Cage must either be dead broke, owe someone the favour to end all favours, or else some Producer has his children held captive. A more wretched pile of steaming sputum was never coughed into existence, including during the 7 years that the Black Death swept across Europe. The script was woefully primitive; better dialogue could easily have been written by encouraging a disease-riddled crow to randomly peck away at a typewriter for 5 minutes.The acting was pathetic. Alarm bells should have rung for me when I saw a supporting cast comprising Chad Michael-Murray, some girl from Neighbours, a former American Idol contestant, and Marty McFly's mum off of Back to the Future. The special effects looked like they were done on a Spectrum ZX81. The pacing and editing was turgid and lumbering, the soundtrack was uninspiring, amateurish and jarring, even the lighting was dull, flat, and caused me to squint like a coal miner resurfacing after a 40-hour shift. The humour, or attempts at it, were uncomfortable and awkward, centering on a running gag of mis-trust between a Muslim and a Little Person getting angrier and angrier with each other which climaxes at the end with the Muslim booting the Midget down the inflatable escape slide of the plane. It sounds like it could be funny, even just for the slapstick. It isn't. This affront to celluloid isn't even in the \"so bad it's good\" bucket, as even Christian film reviewers (for this IS the story of The Rapture after all) slammed this movie quicker than Judas turns snitch at the sight of some silver.If someone offers you the chance to watch this movie, or as I did you see it pop up on Netflix and get suckered in by the Sci-Fi sounding synopsis and decide to give it a shot, I can highly recommend taking yourself into your back garden and liberally beating yourself around the genitals with a half-brick.

            "content": "Pretty much from the opening scene I knew this movie was going nowhere. First of all what is up with the background music in this film? Its like they picked the most generic music from 90's made-for-TV movies they could find and inserted it into literally EVERY scene. Background music should be subtle and seamless. Luckily for the viewers, we don't have to figure out for ourselves when a heartwarming, sad, or suspenseful scene is happening. The blunt and strangely loud background music will let you know how to feel very quickly.Second of all, did they just go with the first take for every scene? Personally I think Nick Cage gets a bad rap most of the time for taking on terrible roles, but this was bad even for him. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was watching a bad soap opera. How they even spent $16m on this thing is beyond me.I'm generally not too critical of movies, since I have an idea of what I'm getting into before I see a movie, and I take it for what it is. But in this case it was just so amateurish and rough. Its hard to believe the people that made this movie watched the final cut and said \"Yep, we did it guys, that's a wrap!\" Its just awful on so many levels. Not even taking into account the story line which is a whole other discussion altogether.For some reason nobody on a a plane full of Americans (who are presumably 75% Christian) have ever heard of the rapture lol. Hey lets put a Muslim guy in there too. We'll show how they aren't all bad, but so sorry you picked the wrong God to worship. No heaven for you! Plus we also learned God isn't particularly fond of little people or the mentally impaired. To sum it up, after all is said and done, if you literally believe in the rapture I'm sure you'll still like it even with all its flaws. And if you're just looking for a moderately entertaining movie to rent for a buck, do yourself a favor and rent Calvary instead.",

(NO SPOILERS) The film is basically themed around the Rapture where loads of people just disappeared into thin air only leaving there belongings behind. No one knows why this has happened apart from a minority who are seen as mad or going mad. Most of the film is set on a plane where the crew and passengers are confused but have to deal with technical problems with the plane and they have to try and get back to an airport whilst they are over the Atlantic. This is basically a Mystery/Aviation film with a little bit of Action as well. (That's the way it came across to me) At times the film came across as a little bit narrow minded and didn't have as much action as I thought it would. I'm not sure if this was a budget movie but it did come across that way sometimes and I felt they could have made a bigger impact, for example there could have been scenes showing the global impact of people going missing just so you got more of a sense this was global rather than being concentrated on the plane all the time.

I, as an Atheist, was surprisingly not really phased by the religious aspect of the film. After watching I did not think 'oh no I need to believe in God otherwise I'll burn in hell' but I did think that maybe I should be more aware of my actions. For example, in the future I'll make sure I don't have the short temper of the angry little dwarf. The moral aspect of the film was flawed though because the Muslim man was arguably the kindest man in the whole film yet he was left in the chaotic world which shows what is wrong with some religion.There was a moment in the film though, where Cage was theatrically tearing up on the phone to his daughter who was at the top of the bridge, and a tear ran down my face. I found that moment in the film compelling and profound, no matter what has happened, the love between a father and a daughter is one of the strongest bonds in the world. Much stronger than the will of a delusional bearded man in the sky.I actually feel that this was not a Christian film, but an ambiguously atheistic one exposing the ills of religion and that strong characters such as Ray, Buck and Irene can defy against it in in fire and blood and anguish.I maintain my view that role choice doth not maketh the actor and that despite the awful films he finds himself in, Nicolas Cage is a good actor and equal in genius to his uncle - Francis Ford Coppola. This film would be much more awful without Cage.",

Leaving the theater, I was asking myself, \"How could a movie about something so big, be so bland?\" Speculating, it may be that too much money was spent on the A list actor and not enough on development of the screenplay. I know there are many non-believers in Hollywood, and what appears to have happened is that this movie was influenced by that element so much that major themes that would have made the movie more interesting, were simply avoided or left-out. I enjoyed the performances of Cassie Thompson (playing Chloe Steele) and Nicky Whelan (playing Hattie Durham) but overall, I believe this movie had so much more potential and left the theater feeling like Hollywood did not really present much substance about the Rapture other than it's depiction of it's occurrence.",

It just looked like a 1980 midday matin\u00e9e. Acting and dialog were dreadful. It had to get better, right? Nope. I was embarrassed for choosing this movie.

The other is his daughter on the ground. Both are trying to deal with the events of the rapture. As a window into the lives of this family, it was a good movie. On the plane they mostly dealt with the first class passengers. They had to compress a 4 hour flight into a 2 hour movie. If you are looking for character development, that is not what this movie was about. This movie was a small glimpse into the lives of a few people after the rapture occurred. as such, it was a good movie. The movie presents the pre-tribulation view of the rapture. People slowly remember their Bible lessons from their youth, which after 4 hours, people might actually do. It was clever to put a Muslim on the plane and it is customary in movies like these to have a pastor be left behind. The pastor was a bit less broken up than I would think he would be. All babies and children (they do not specific what age) are saved, which is gracious. \"millions\" are saved, which presents a very narrow road. Census data shows over a billion people who call themselves Christian. So, generally speaking, it got the point across. It was entertaining, it glorified God and it presented the Gospel. Remembering that the only people speaking are unsaved, I think they presented the Gospel as good as unsaved people could. So I recommend this movie for Christians, but especially for those who do not believe. The rapture will happen...soon",

Not a single aspect worked in the film as the script, actors and the main story line completely failed. The End of Days religious theme and construct should have provided an interwoven fabric for those saved souls including any redemption opportunities. Indeed, had the writers decided to take up the challenge of writing of those 'left behind' and how they could redeem themselves, then hope exists for us all. However, the completely shallow and one dimensional script was not only laughable in stages, you wonder how anyone could have signed off their work. The overly theatrical and predictable acting of several scenes show how brainwashed the studios are to think the watching audience can be duped into parting with good money. Surely someone who reviewed the film before release would have raised the white flag and ditched the film. One of the lowlights was watching a once respected actor now at the bottom of his career and you have to question why he agreed to be part of such a disaster. Please tell anyone interested in watching the film to pitch higher than their shoe laces for entertainment.",

I read the reviews for this movie and out of sheer stubborn curiosity I had to see what a disaster Nic Cage had gotten involved in.Truthfully, I think many other atheists have been a little unfair. Yes, this film wears its 'holier than thou' on it's sleeve, yes the story is pants and yes, definitely among Mr. Cage's worst efforts ever.But...The acting is, well, okay. The cinematography and direction is also okay and the music choices, while certainly awful in two places (both Christian songs,) were nowhere near as bad as has been made out and even, occasionally, appropriate for many scenes. (A sinister yet choral piece during the actual rapture and tense, dramatic music for the finale being decent examples.)Which just leaves the writing. Well, when all is said and done, its based on a book series that was designed to preach to the choir and the film was only ever really going to see mass numbers in the Christian community, so non-Christians, agnostics and Atheists could not help but feel preached to.That being said, the film opens with an evangelist being quite effectively 'shut-down' by a non-believer right from the start and, apart from dad 'hinting' at mom's new-found craziness and the daughter almost getting preached at by said mom, there's nary a mention of religion until about 3/4 of the way through and, even then, no-one yells 'you have to accept Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Saviour to reach the Kingdom of Heaven!' at any point. Oh, there's one almost guilty pleasure at the sight of a Christian Pastor who was not saved and I couldn't help thinking that, in reality, there's going to be hell of a lot of supposed Christians with eggs on their faces if the Rapture was really going to happen as their 'lip-service' Christianity is rewarded like this guy.Truthfully, apart from the insulting way that the writers and director insinuate that those who have not been saved by God are almost all morally deficient in one way or another - rioters, armed robbers, bag snatchers, violent angry bystanders, philanderers, Muslims (not my take, theirs), capitalists, conspiracy nuts etc - the story is just a plain old interpretation, with a sprinkling of family drama and action, of 2000 year old Biblical hog-wash. The way it was interpreted, acted, filmed etc was nowhere near great but it was also quite watchable... just.",

I give this movie 7/10 due in large part to the acting, which while thin on the ground, made the best of the material provided. The first class cabin passengers were well chosen, but added nothing to the story except confusion. Nick Cage played his usual reluctant sleazy hero type. To be fair this is not the worst film that I've seen him in, but comes close. The biggest disappointment was the two story lines that eventually meet up with hugs and kisses amidst apocalyptic styled road works. The lead up to this is slow slow slow ...

It has quite a low user rating (4.6) mainly because non-believers didn't like the Christian fundamentalist aspects of the story. But compared to this film, it tells A LOT more story, is A LOT more dramatic and generally works as a reasonable piece of story telling, regardless of whether you can believe the main scenario or not. By comparison, this film tells virtually nothing of the main theme of the book (and the earlier film), explains nothing about the views of the 'crazy' Christians, and even has to be politically correct by showing a Muslim being all nicey-nicey to other passengers. There is little or poor character development, no-one I felt any real sympathy for - Cage's character seems a weak-willed mushy non- entity; the stewardess (Hattie) that he supposedly has been having an affair with is unattractive and incompetent; a spoiled daughter; an illiterate wife... the list could go on! It's low rating (3.1 at time of writing) is more than it deserves! Millions of people are supposed to have vanished at the same time - this would result in chaotic catastrophe on a vast scale, but we see next-to-nothing of this! Surely some CGI could have produced massive vehicle pile-ups, maybe a few downed aircraft, or the odd Then the daughter supposedly in heroine mode, lights a signal for her father to land the plane, by setting light to a few fuel barrels - in the middle of chaos which would have had hundreds of fires burning, that you get just a glimpse of right near the end! There are so many faults in the film due I presume to poor or non- existent research, that it doesn't even make a half- decent air- disaster movie.

Now onto the differences:Movie - Chloe comes home from college on a surprise birthday visit before Rapture. Book - Chloe doesn't come home till after the Rapture.Movie - Rayford Steele's Plan is in the air for the entire movie. Book - Rayford isn't in the air the entire book.

Book - Rayford is the one that actually finds his wife and son gone from the world.Movie - Rayford is cheating on his wife with Hattie Durham (she doesn't even know he is married till later). Book - Rayford never cheated on his wife.

            "content": "OK here's the deal. These books were so amazing I (like millions of ppl) seriously have been waiting years for this movie. These were the best most compelling books I have ever read, and I read everything. I waged my own mini social media campaign with the production co, book writers etc to try to ensure they didn't make it cheesy, low budget like the last one and like every Christian themed current-times movie (they do OK on the ones from biblical times). I am rating it very high simply so that they will get plenty of traffic to the theater so that they will continue as planned and make the next one from the series of books. I am assuming that the next one will be vastly better once they take in the critiques and feedback from this one. The pro's were it kept your interest, the plane scenes were decent in terms of suspense and the acting improved as the movie progressed. My expectations were low and I'm not sure why I have to have low expectations except that based on the past 20 years of movies with any kind of religious theme, they have this odd propensity to come out like cable TV movies with poor acting and poor effects. No clue why because the Christianish movies always do well at the box office even though the viewers cringe through them. Please give us something to RAVE about just once!! So here are my gripes: 1) why oh why do they always have to portray the Christian character in the movie like some flowery, simplistic, somewhat strange, unlikeable character? In real life that is so far off from whats true. Why cant they have had the mother as an intelligent, strong, dynamic career woman that was desperately trying to ensure her family was informed and prepared for what she knew was coming? Everyone I know in Corporate America is a Christian and I have never come across one remotely like the mother in this film. Instead Leah Thomson's character was so wimpy, over acting, not real, whiny and annoying that you could see clearly why she was unable to persuade her family in any direction. Someone that has strong convictions does not come across like that, believe me. I could have recommended a slew of women I know that they could have used to blow that role out of the park. 2) Why does the daughter/non Christian have to be boiling- over angry at God and anyone that believes?? The realty is most non Christian's aren't like Chloe's character at all, and wouldn't be yelling at their mom for believing, and yelling at random ppl in the airport for believing, they are just PASSIVE, no real strong opinion either way- so her character would have been more believable as just a 20- something girl busy with her life, no time to really focus on God with all her other priorities and thinking her mom is just too into the bible for her taste. 3) Why cant a Christian movie ever have any heart wrenching, dramatic, tear jerker, meaningful, moments? I'm talking about the scene in Forest Gump where he buries Jenny and talks to her grave about their son or when Lt Dan screams at God from the sail of the boat. Or the scene in Shawshank where Morgan Freeman sits down at the stone wall and reads the note he digs up from under the rock. Actually put Morgan Freeman in the sequel because his voice alone adds depth and drama to any movie involving GOD. That's what this movie needed- it was way too focused on the chaos of ppl disappearing and didn't include one moving, jolting message or emotional scene that brings you to your knees, when the book was FULL of those!! Nicholas Cage was a little to wamsy pamsy to be Rayford Steel, the character needed to be much more strong, authoritative, charismatic. Buck was good. American Idol girl was not, Scene with gun was way too long and awkward. Little person was good. Need more normal characters next time, please. They need a panel of critics that are not involved with movie industry but are nonetheless movie going experts that can consult with them throughout production on what works and what doesn't. I literally could have advised them down to the expressions on the faces of the actors as to what worked and what needed to change. So I'm giving it an 8 simply because I wasn't as disappointed as I thought I'd be but still so annoyed that I have to have lowered expectations on a movie based on books that sold over 40 mill. Cant steven spielberg make the sequel? If it wasn't based on these phenomenal books attempting to deliver a super important message Id likely had given it a 5 on the 'real movie rating' scale....",

I'm not specifically religious and in this world where God does not step in and start answering prayers, it seems a bit of a cop-out.

Thomson and Murray were quite fair.... but there was also the other cast members that felt almost as if they were not trying and just going through the motions.Effects, scenes, sets and camera work were all reasonable.

The fact that this may truly be the future of mankind and the futility of the success at the end make this worse than any horror film to me and I cry every time, especially when the main girl climbs up to the top of the bridge, as I can relate to her feelings of fear and not being able to go on just waiting for certain death. There isn't really an ending to this, but the reason for it, I think, is because the ending would simply be them trying to survive until they die and go to hell. One could argue that they should have shown us the broken seals and catastrophes that are meant to happen in the last days, but that would be a different film. this film may not necessarily deserve a 10 but it certainly deserves better than 3.1",

It's a great concept because this concept could reach alot of people: believers, science fiction lovers, thriller lovers, fantacy lovers, etc.. Unfortunately the movie clearly didn't turn out so well because it won't spark any interest of any group that's interested in the concept.One big reason for this was that the script is written poorly because there's a lack of thought that went into it. Think of these \"millions\" of people that dissapeared while this'd only be around 1/2000 people on earth?! Maybe it's just me, but the street was full of the weirdly foulded clothing of vanished people. Another example would be the poor terms used to just save some time in writing the script such as the plane that could not climb because of some defect that doesn't even exist?! Oh yeah, almost forgot, a plane's collision mid-air and face-to-face would probably end differently realisticly speaking.. Oh nevermind, the explanation of that is even covered in the script: \"oh we were lucky\". Not only was there a lack of thought that went into the script, they just forgot to add the developing feature of the characters. Think of any character. I don't recall any character changing in a significant way. Maybe you could call the apology of the captain to his daughter and wife a development, but I'd say he just learned from a mistake he'd make again.Ok it's clear that the script was written poorly and that they just forgot to add a bunch of stuff, lets talk about the actors. They look like me trying to pretend that I like a present I got that I really don't like. Ofcourse in the movie this effect is reversed: most actors are trying to look sad while they realize that the movie is turning out as a complete miscarriage. Oh just as a sidenote: the lighting, filming and graphics are just trash. I could do the lighting better personally with my samsung device that has no flashlight app on it installed. I could do the filming better without a camera. I could do the graphics better by drawing them by hand. An example of this horrible filming is probably that, at one point, you can physically see that a drone is struggeling to film straight with the wind blowing it away. However, the movie was still enjoyable for me. The main reason for this was the pretty actors ;) and the expectation that something special was going to happen like a sudden plottwist. To sum it all up I'd simply say that the movie wasn't terrible because enough money was put into it, but it was bad. This is a movie where I feel like there's a part missing. A part that I can't put my finger on. A part that got lost because the people responsible for making the film got lazy. If you want to watch this movie, please don't even think of good movies like the Matrix or Forrest Gump to compare it with for your own safety.",

This script reads like a draft version from a first year film student and you just wonder why they didn't do their homework on such an important endeavor. They had $31M in the budget and should have had a better script.When movies bomb then budgets get cut for the entire genre and that's sad because the Christian genre can succeed, but it needs professionals in some of the key areas and not amateurs who made a direct to DVD movie before. God bless Paul Lalonde for getting this made, but God can't turn a bad script into a good movie just because a producer deserves it and that's the lesson for everyone.Prayer is great, but God expects you to do the work and that includes having the right people at your side to support you.",

I guess they thought they had the right to do it in hopes of raking in cash from the broad Christian community but it is only right that the movie was panned by left/right, Christian and secular critics. The only possible use for this movie is for making Christian movie makers and Christians in general look stupid. A movie about the coming of Jesus and His name is not mentioned once.

Just done in an awesome way. Like the plane stopping right before the thing they can get blown up by. Yes please (in caps). I like this (thing). I like all about it. I like the way it just made the whole (this word is bad, for some reason, you know what it is, its the end of the world)(bad word for feces) into a perfect action, entertaining, and dare I say, satirical movie. \"looks like the end of the world.\" \"no, not yet, I'm afraid this is just the beginning\"Reccommondation: watch a lot of ****not-so-good movies beforehand, get drunk on red wine, watch this movie!!And yeah, 10/10 because 3,1 is not (in caps) a good rate for this movie. This is not bad (in caps) in any way except maybe story. The acting is 5, the special effects are 6 and the story is 5. The satire though is 7.I'll take it down to 9/10 because this review need a lot of \"correcting\", and well (bad word for intercourse) (deregatory term) IMDb (the act of offering a man oral pleasure) in their guidelines",

            "content": "Okay, so I have watched the original one with Kirk Cameron, which I loved and own. I also have the other movies. So, when I saw this, I thought this couldn't be the same movie; they couldn't be remaking Left Behind. I was wrong. Seeing Nicholas Cage and Lea Thompson as the top named actors for this production, I thought it couldn't be that bad. It was. I'm not one to leave reviews and I'm not one to judge a movie based on reviews, but this one I had to. First, the acting was sub par. Cage movies, for me, are always a hit or miss. Sometimes he hits and does a wonderful job and sometimes he misses and it's awful. His character in this did not have any range. I wondered why he would do this movie to begin with, given it is supposed to be a Christian movie, but when I saw it, I can say that he didn't overact at all, but underacted. There was no passion, no connection with the character. It was flat when it should have been round. Second, the daughter. Her acting was way to over done. I couldn't help but wonder if she did this because she didn't know how to portray the character or if that was her interpretation of the character. Third, the script. I can't think of another movie off the top of my head where the main two characters are solely set in two scenes. There is so much more to this movie, book, than just two scenes. It took away from the whole meaning of what the book is about. There was no detail about the rapture, which by the way is the term used when all the people disappear and go to heaven. There was no in depth discussion of God or what was coming. The characters, like I said before and I know this has a lot to do with the writing, were flat, they didn't really grow. Instead they seemed to take the whole thing like it happened everyday and, well, they were wrong. The supporting characters on the plane also reacted in ways that were not believable. I know when it does happen people will be confused, upset, scared, etc, but they just didn't seem to really get it. Fourth, the movie lacked any spiritual message. This movie is about people being left behind to deal with the tribulation that will happen after the rapture. The anti-Christ coming, and the new world order. The message underlying this movie is supposed to be about being or getting saved so those who live by and for God, have a chance to be taken up during the rapture and not left behind. It's supposed to be spiritually moving and awaken that God shaped hole inside of us to seek Him out. It did not. It failed at the purpose behind the author writing it. It wasn't just for entertainment value, but to wake people up and bring them to God. My final thoughts on this movie as I sat and watched all of it, were why did they even make it? Were they just in a crunch and needed something to produce? It is regurgitated in a way that leaves anyone who has read the books or seen the original movie wanting something else. They should have just left it behind and found something else to produce.",

The rest of the first book's elements and characters are entirely left out, possibly for a sequel film but who knows, leaving us with a dumbed-down adaptation designed mostly to get people in the theater seats to watch it. The 2000 Cloud Ten Pictures version was much better at handling the entire story of the first book, compressed as it was for the amount of screen time the studio could afford to show it in. Let's hope and pray that this film succeeds at least enough to warrant a sequel where the Antichrist gets properly introduced and we get to see stuff going down as in the original books.",

I have never watched \"The Animal.\" Why? It's not my cup of tea. So, I didn't watch it, and because of that, I didn't rate it.

I give this movie 8/10, because yeah, some of the dialog stinks, some of the graphics are so-so, but it's got Nick Cage, explosions (lol), and doesn't let any archetype get away without some scrutiny.I won't even get into Biblical doctrine, which I know is a large point of contention with these books and movies, because this story is an interpretation only.

The acting in the film isn't terrible (better than Asylum films) but it's rather stiff due to trying to appeal to a broad audience and not just a Christian audience. So there's a variety of people in the film at the beginning.So ultimately I believe it failed more with Christian audiences because of how they were portrayed. However it's difficult to appeal to a broad audience with Christian subject material, because such materials are often preaching-to-the-choir, and people don't like to be preached at, so the film avoids doing that. To appeal to a broad audience, the film toned down much of Christian symbolism, and left it to the audience interpret why the people were left behind.A different film, \"This is the End\" - which is a Seth Rogan film, though it's a comedy, I feel it was more on-the-nose about the subject material.I'd recommend showing \"Left Behind\" to film studies classes on adaption decay. How you can't dilute a film's controversial source material to gain a broad audience appeal, since it will always backfire.",

What a disappointing realization that most of the movie is just the interior of the jumbo jet. So much focus is put on Cage, that they forgot about the plot line of the book, and original movie. There is so much important information left out because of this that if there is a second movie, it's going to be equally terrible. This version had a dragged-out, boring feel to it. If any over-the-top religious followers try to say that this movie didn't do well because the world is less into God, they are so very wrong. This movie sucks because it was done very poorly. If you're interested in seeing this movie, watch the 90's version. It may have that older feel of the 90's, but at least the whole movie isn't focused on Cage in a plane. And at least it does the actual story justice. Personally, I hope they don't make the second movie.",

Too many people rate films on the whole cinematography of it all. that to me is wrong.

Anyway, i cant take on the meme today. His acting is absolutely fine, it works, I've seen him ina few films like this over the past few years, hes good at the regular guy mode. The other actors especially the plane were great as well, they seemed like the regular life person you meet and the steps you take with the baggage you carry. it felt good, they all played their parts really well. Special mentions to the Islamic character, perfect delivery on the 'oh, this again' feel as a lot of people have with people of different creeds, its sickening to me but he delivered his parts well. overall - I watched it, listened, it did its purpose, i mean if i were to tell you I've fallen asleep to interstellar twice now (and im massive scifi and supporter of most of the actors in that film) this had me thinking a bit and i didn't fall asleep!",

The acting was awful. The writing/dialog was awful. It was 100 times worse than the Kirk Cameron version and honestly neither movies do justice to the books. Nicholas Cage's acting is awful, I don't know what happened to him over the years, but his acting has really gone downhill.Recently there have been a number of REALLY well done faith based movies.

Looks like you have to be Christian to get into heaven because at least we get to know that the devout Muslim is definitely not on the list.

By the time I was seated to watch Left Behind stepping up to bat in the \"some sort of aeroplane-based disaster\" innings, I was expecting the appeal to have worn off somewhat.But oddly enough, it hadn't worn off all that much. Granted I wasn't exactly immersed: the opening wasn't so much tension-building as \"so yeah, is something interesting gonna happen yet?\". And of course the ending, which I won't spoil but regardless don't think actually can't be spoilt, is arguably anti-climatic in comparison to... well, anything.And yet, even as a non-religious viewer, I was not at all put off by the Christian theme - in the same way I can enjoy Harry Potter without believing in magic. Between disequilibrium and conclusion it was fairly well-directed, transitioning between characters at the right times, and reasonably realistic for the given scenario.There's not much else to fault. Aside from the acting skills (or lack thereof) of children, Cassi Thompson plays her role well, and you don't even need to give Nic Cage's character a name because he's just Nic Cage in everything these days - which is not necessarily a bad thing if you're a fan.Regardless of your beliefs, by factoring out religion entirely, Left Behind can actually be appreciated (just pretend it's like Harry Potter - anything's possible) and I wouldn't say it's as awful as everyone is making it out to be. A long shot from amazing, yes, but worth a one-time watch nonetheless, and if Cage signs on for the sequels, I'm down. It's not like National Treasure 3 is coming out any time soon.",

Sure the acting could use some improvement but once after I saw this movie, I felt inspired to own up to a few things to people that I've greatly disputed with. The fact that the rapture will happen sometime in the future and terrible events to happen afterwords (not event specifically according to the movie) made me wonder if getting left behind would happen to me, that is if it would happen in my life time. The things that got me puzzled in this movie were a few people who were left behind when the rapture happened. 1) The lady with dementia or a dementia related illness. She was left behind but her husband was taken, that threw me off because I didn't think someone like deserved to be left behind due to the fact that they can't recognize the situation they were in. I didn't know if the person deserved whether or not to go to heaven but that's not my decision to make. 2) The dog that was left behind when his master was taken. It's like really? That was a heart breaking moment for me and I just couldn't believe that's what will happen when the rapture happens. 3) The Muslim. despite the fact I'm a Christian, I find it hard to believe that just Christian that will be saved. Muslims and various other religious people believe that there is a God so why wouldn't they be saved? Someone is going to have to explain that to me. 3) All the children were gone. Really all the children? Including all the bullies and the delinquents in juvenile hall? The bible talks a lot about envy for children and that God loves children but to be honest, it also talks a lot about how steeling and murder are very bad things for which many children in the world have done these things.

Even he must've realized that at one point in production because his acting shifts monotonous in the airplane scenes. One would expect a Captain Steele (especially if played by Nick Cage) to be more heroic. If not, at least scared soiled-pants. Some kind more \"reactive\", or whatever. It seemed as if Steele's character barely made it as a secondary role. I was expecting a sci-fi movie, but was deceptively turned down with biblical connotations (I admit never having read the books, so couldn't know). When I figured that much partly through the movie (even before it was explained because this movie is so simple and predictive), I was expecting... no wait... I was HOPING to get something more out of it. And I waited. Waited. Wasted good popcorn while waiting. AND THEN IT CAME: the end credits. I was so disappointed.The story can be explained in two (more like one and a half) sentences: Millions of people disappeared in the blink of an eye while Capt. Steele is flying his plane and needs to emergency land (obviously); achieved with the help of his multi-talented super cute college daughter.Anything else to support the story-line is thinned out (stretched) to an almost meaningless state. There's character development where it isn't always necessary. Scenes seem to get repetitive. College girl can drive a motorcycle picked up on the street and a construction roller left on site (bet she could pilot a helicopter too, why not?). She blows things up. Finds the only place to enter a building unnoticed, while rioting people try to make their way inside in anyway possible.All in all, if my review can prevent some of you to watch this movie, then I will have saved two hours from each of you so you can watch something better that deserves popcorn.

If your biased or anti anything that is Christian or god centered i would advise you not to see the movie. The movie is based of the book series which are actually very good. Aimed at a specific audience and drags on in some spots. Kept my mom, me and my sister worthwhile. People who say this is the worst movie they've ever seen probably haven't seen that many movies.

There is just the fact that millions have disappeared in thin air (apparently gone to heaven) while a whole lot of chaos is left behind. I've enjoyed the 70's and 80's Airport movies and this film has a sort of feel of such movies as the tension is there although I must admit that there are movies out there with similar plane sequences which I never fail to get fed up of seeing.",

Like the LOTR trilogy, I don't expect much in the first installment except build-up. Revelations is the best and most interesting doomsday plot. Based in longstanding beliefs on prophecy and the bible. This will touch home with many believers. Not all Christians though as there are some Christians that interpret Revelations differently and without Rapture. Either way, I would pay to see more movies like this. Keep em' coming Hollywood!",

And to calm all Christians, I am a Christian and found the storyline and the movie in general a really poor effort altogether. SORRY, but this is a 0/10 movie. The fact that the story suggests that those who stayed behind are all bad people and not worthy of God's grace and heaven is just ludicrous and offensive to those who are not Christian. The whole purpose of the movie is to illustrate what the bible says about end of days, but it does not show it as I think it was meant to be.",

When you cast Kirk Cameron and he's the star talent, well....... I disagree that there was hidden Christian agendas throughout the movie. The whole book series is closely based on the book of Revelations as the events unfold. The only real creative liberties taken were in the creation of characters to give the story a human element. The actual series is quite long, and if they develop the book series to the big screen, I think you'll find that it's not portraying the ones Left Behind as moral degenerates but, more like regular people drowning in the culture of greed that the world is becoming. I say this because, later in the series these folks become the heroes, again creating the human element, as you witness them develop into their full potential. Sure, the story comes from the Christian bible but, the human element is quite real and exists in each of us. Who doesn't know someone that's been flattened by the churning machine our world has become and never really completely recover? Just follow the series and you'll see that it's all about the unique qualities, skills and gifts that reside in ALL of us, and the elements of self reflection and realization. Many can argue (and I'll usually agree) that the modern Christian church message is pretty distorted, and pretty judgmental. But, few can argue that the actual message of Christ (whether you are a believer or not) is a beautiful message teaching tolerance, patience, compassion and love toward each other, regardless of how they believe, social status, income bracket, etc. You could almost say He created the first MASS hippie movement of that time. Teaching peace, love and tolerance. :)",

Not every movie out there is the type I can watch with my parents or grand parents. But Left Behind is family friendly and has a fantastic cast.

His talent has been squandered and has withered. This must surely be the low point of his career (I hope for his and our sakes).Then one gets to that fact that this is a piece of Christian propaganda. For non- Christians a pretty offensive one dimensional moral view of the world. Awful! Awful! Awful!",

I remembered the old movies and the books (ze wife has read them) and vaguely remembered reading about a remake too. I stopped the movie right there \"no thanks, not at least right now\".So tonight looking for something to watch for us on Netflix (getting harder all the time) this was in the \"continue watching\" so I briefly mentioned about it. She wanted to watch it, I was like uhh.... Well came to IMDb to see rating and some reviews. Seeing the very low rating and multiple reviews with 1 star and quite heavy bashing I was expecting a real bad movie and sort of just wanted to see how bad it is. But it wasn't that bad at all. Many wrote this is the worst film they've seen, but personally I've seen a LOT of films LOT worse than this. To give it 1 star is a joke IMO. I can't help but to think that it has to do with the religionous subject. To me the subject is interesting (rapture). I love all kinds of post apocalyptic stuff though. At the end of the movie they say \"it looks like the end of the world\", \"no, it's just beginning\", I was like alright, bring it on! I Would definitely watch a sequel.To me acting was all OK, again, I've seen lot worse acting. Cage's performance IMO was just typical him. The movie is not boring or slow at all, as many people said they would fall a sleep during it. My biggest gripe I guess would be the landing in the end FX wise, But I guess as someone said, most of the budget went to Cage lol..There was also not any forced preaching which I was personally slightly afraid of, on the contrary I think..I don't know.. I've never written a review before, but thought I just had to cause I think if this movie was pretty much the same but was about an alien abduction in the end, the rating would be higher than it is. It could have easily been alien ships in the end seen on over the city if we didn't knew before hand what the movie was about (there's really not that much religious stuff at all in the movie, the characters actually have multiple and even some funny theories about what's going on). To me the actual subject is more interesting to be honest though. At least I'd say don't let the reviews or the religious subject turn you off. Actually in the movie's context there's no real conclusion what has happened other than Cage's character's thoughts, so it could be aliens after all!!",

I understand the importance of this part, but it did drag on on this particular point.On to the rest of the movie. I saw nothing wrong with the movie in itself, the script writers chose to focus on this part of the story for the movie. Is it just like the book? No movie is. There is a difference in how we see the book in our heads and how any movie comes out, that's just plain fact. There's also interpretation points, what you see as a meaning to something doesn't necessarily mean everyone else will. And here's another point. It's a movie. Take what you want from it. Take from it that it drags on at some parts and you have the attention span of a flea. Or take from it the possible points where civilization is leading itself. Or take from it what the world truly would look like if something major happened, where we would all turn on each other instead of working together. Being suspicious and mean purely because they can.Being Christian isn't about black and white, there are some rules that are constant, and there are some things we just have to take on faith that in /some/ way, whether it's literally or figuratively things will happen. Some people will see it as a rotational cleansing of the world by the world or cosmos itself. Others will see it as a godly action. It's not the point though. The important part is where you'll be if something happens. Will you be someone making it worse or someone trying to help people through. Being Christian is about loving people and being there for them. If you're a thumper, good for you, your faith is strong and I hope it's the way you think it should be. For those who don't believe, the universe is cyclical, look through history. SOmething will happen someday, when and what who knows. For everyone else, sometimes the story isn't something as a whole that's taken but small parts that are the most relevant to you.",

I never read the original books, but my thinking on the subject is clear. I hope the life I lived and the works I have accomplished were 'Good' and helpful to most people for the most part, but helpful and not helpful are relative concepts depending on your perspective. This movie was good to me, I could not have made it, so with everyone being a critic, I think people should consider if they had to produce this story as a film, how would their finished product look? The reviews we write should be honest, yes, but there should be equal measures of kindness included as well. If the starring actor was paid a million dollar salary for 10 days work, maybe this is exactly what that effort was worth! What if they had agreed to a salary like this and due to unforseen complications three weeks were required to complete filming? I think this movie has many merits as a finished product and both my wife and I enjoyed watching it! Actually. Yes. We watched it on a monthly subscription service, free form commercial interruptions and I thought it had many nicely composed, thoughtful scenes with characters simply disappearing for an \"unknown\" reason! It is a nearly complete story and of sufficient length to meet my personal length requirements (i.e. > 88 minutes).",

Some issues I had with this movie: It does not have good CGI, it is so simple. The soundtrack and the movie score do not go with the script and the end is so ridiculous and completely unrealistic. < spoiler alert >Nick landing the aircraft on a construction site without lights is laughable and when the aircraft came to a stop, it was a centimeter away from a gasoline tanker. Again, laughable.In summary, its a bad movie with a controversial theme. If you like easygoing movies where you can switch off your brain for a couple of hours then this movie is perfect for you.",

It wasn't.The first two \"Left Behind\" books were made into three movies from 2000-2005 by Cloud Ten Productions. They were terrible (but not as terrible as the new one). They were so terrible that book series co- author Tim LaHaye sued to get the movie rights back. After a lengthy court battle, he won in 2008. Unfortunately, the deal said that he had a few years to make his own movie and he was not able to, so the original producers got the movie rights back. So they decided to make another \"Left Behind\" movie, a reboot that made \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" look like a good idea.The \"Left Behind\" movies Cloud Ten previously made starred teen heart-throb turned evangelist Kirk Cameron. Other movies made by the company have starred Gary Busey and Mr. T. But with the new \"Left Behind\" movie, they decided they were ready for the big league and nabbed Nicolas Cage - the actor who never turns down a role. (Actually, he dropped out of \"Expendables 3\" in order to star in \"Left Behind\".)As a big fan of the books, I felt like I was being pranked as every new detail came out about the new movie. When production didn't start as scheduled in spring 2013, I hoped that it wouldn't be made. Filming was pushed to late summer. When it got to be one month before the scheduled June 20, 2014 release and there still wasn't a trailer, I hoped that the movie wouldn't be released. The release was rescheduled for October.I looked forward to the movie as much as the average \"Star Wars\" fan would look forward to George Lucas writing and directing a JarJar Binks movie (which would be a better movie than the new \"Left Behind\" movie). I started watching it knowing that it was going to be horrible. It was worse. I can't even mention everything that movie made me feel. Just know that as bad as it was for you to watch it, it was an even worse for a fan of the books.To quote one movie review, \"Cloud Ten was sued for making a bad Left Behind movie. The newest rendition of Left Behind is not just bad. It's act of vengeance on Tim LaHaye for the years of courtroom battles.\" And now he and co-author Jerry Jenkins are forced to break the ninth commandment and say that the movie is really good and that they enjoyed it.And so I am, and probably everybody who watched the new \"Left Behind\" movie are, waiting for an apology from producer Paul Lalonde. Expect another bad movie before the apology comes. Or maybe even the Rapture.",

Nicolas Cage's acting is no worse (or no better) then in Con Air 17 years earlier and he's done well. Regarding the plot it's extremely difficult to predict anything in the film.Obviously I didn't know what to expect. After a slow start the movie takes you on a ride and holds your attention till the end. Probably the movie was rated bad due to it's low budget which is making itself present in the poor special effects. The movie is probably also not what you would expect of a Nicolas Cage movie as it lacks the usual amount of sex and violence (obviously another reason for it's bad rating). What counts for me is the unpredictability and the suspense, but most of all, what blows your mind is the mystery. If you like mystery and suspense you will enjoy this film.I'm giving it a 7 because of the poor special effects. But the special effects are not what counts in this film and even without them it would still be a great movie. Which cannot be said about the most Hollywood blockbusters recently coming out since they are mostly only about the special effects.",

You rarely see big time actors take on Christian world view roles. For the sake of a community that might not have otherwise watched this type of film. I personally do believe the rapture is going to happen, also any day now for the time and seasons of this age are present and all around us. The Bible is 1/4 prophecy in a whole and most people don't realize that because people don't want to talk about that anymore now days (prophecy fulfilled btw). It is called the blessed hope for a reason it is an escape of the coming wrath of God for an evil and Christ rejecting world. \nIf you did like this movie Kevin Sorbo just made its sequel recently. It really hit home to how the world has changed in the last few years.

Gotta say - other reviews I have seen are tough - seem to mix up their own views on Christianity with a movie about Christianity.",

Given the subject matter, I was worried it was either going to be too pro-religion with lots of \"preaching\" or too anti-religion and just a hate fest against religious folks. But instead the movie focused on the characters and how they dealt with the immediate dangers that they faced. There's not much of an arc for anyone as it's played mostly as an action movie. It felt like they might've been setting up for a sequel where some of the characters would find some sort of meaningful change, but sadly that doesn't happen here and there's no sequel I can find. But I did think it was an enjoyable and entertaining way to pass the time. Nicholas Cage is great as usual, Cassi Thomson was very good and believable as his daughter, and I was really surprised at how good Nicky Whelan was as the flight attendant that Nic Cage's character is having an affair with. That character could easily have been a typical clich\u00e9d \"evil other woman\" and \"flight attendant from hell\" who hates her passengers. But Whelan (and the writers) make her very real and interesting. There's some unnecessary, and thankfully brief, subplots on the plane, but overall I found it a pleasant surprise.",

Two reasons, I don't think all the \"good\" people are going to taken to Heaven body and soul naked so Jesus and the Antichrist to go all \"Mortal Kombat\".  Second, the Rapture is a fantasy of conservative Christianity who thinks Heaven is harder to get into than Harvard.  All the kids get to go like kids can't sin?  I take it director Vic Armstrong has no kids.  Because they sin all the times.  Hell, the Muslim kid is raptured, which makes no sense.  Considering his Muslim dad was \"left behind\".  So what's the sin here?  If it's not being Christian than the Muslim kid should go and it's not being Muslim, what was the dad's sin.  The sins that caused them to be left behind.  The adultry of the pilot I can understand.  But being addicted to drugs is not a sin, they need help.  Also the PG-13 dumbing it down, like a Pureflix was behind it.  One scene a guy goes flying through a window after being shot in the face by a shot gun but the blood was white.  It feels like a Estus Pirkle sermon.  But Estus Pirkle's movie wouldn't dumb it down, that guy wouldn't have a face anymore.  Lastly, the whole Rapture is nothing but people vanishing without seeing their naked bodies floating to Heaven, again thank you PG-13. It's nothing but bullshit conservative hypocrisy.  Read the Bible, not made up things like The Rapture or Dante's Inferno.",
